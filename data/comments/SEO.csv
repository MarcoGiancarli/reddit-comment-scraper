SEO,3e54q4,shua__,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:30:47 2015 UTC,"Bad idea.   You need to give search engines something to rank, you make your content membership only that will forsure have a negative impact on your SEO. Sorry about that.   I think in your case, the best thing you can do is have a premium content section. Which would be completely unranked, and then wont have an impact of the ranking of your current site.   But if you're already getting a solid flow of traffic, have you tried adsense or some sort of promotion?   PM me, I'd be happy to help you out where I can."

SEO,3e54q4,Alose1982,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:44:30 2015 UTC,"You normally want to use a lead magnet to persuade visitors to opt into your email list. Have you considered using a pop over to offer visitors exclusive content?  On one of our client's sites, we basically used a landing page for the homepage. The entire site (except premium content) is indexed. If you visit the site, you are offered a high value software download in exchange for becoming a free member.  After that, you are offered premium content and downloads. The website owner also grows his list through webinars.  You can also use a plugin that will create a pop over that requires registration to read the rest of an article. RJ Metrics uses this for their premium content. This will effect the bounce rate on these pages so I wouldn't do it to an entire site.  Another method is to create a pop over that never expires. Once it is triggered (by scroll percentage or time) it cannot be closed until you complete the registration process. Your site's content will continue to be indexed."

But you'll also notice that it's not just SEO/PPC that they're familiar with.  The think I personally love about SEO is that you can add experience from other sectors to really boost your reputation as an expert in the field and that can help you to determine a new direction to go if you so choose. Content, web dev and design, marketing, social. SEO and PPC are great, but use another year or two to get familiar with these other sectors too and you'll be more reliable as a solo consultant or even in a manager/directing role."

SEO,3e4ghn,nobugsinmyveggies,2,Tue Jul 21 21:51:49 2015 UTC,"Here are the facts. If you get branding links and brand your site, you will get all of the misspelled versions.  The more people link to you and search for your brand, the faster Google learns that the misspells are for your site. You will find that you will get links with the typos and solidify the results even better.  Good branding and actual brand searches.  Contrary to what most ""supposed' professional SEO's state, Google is ranking things with user interaction on the site (in part) and I have tested this with multiple services like pandabot and jumped many two word phrases over 5 positions in just a day or two. So if they give the wrong results for misspelled versions, there will be adjustments by Google's machine learning algo and they will correct it...unless your site is hit with a penalty."
SEO,3e4ghn,jcorkern,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:49:41 2015 UTC,"I heard G is measuring the time it takes for a searcher to come back and search again on their page.  In other words, going to a site from a Google serp and coming back immediately will make Google think that the site is not much for ""user interaction"" as you have called it."
SEO,3e4ghn,superm8n,2,Tue Jul 21 23:05:43 2015 UTC,"They are measuring all of it.  But yes, you are talking about pogo sticking. search for a keyword, click the site and then hit the back button and go to the next site, you just put a red x on that page for Google to see. If it happens too much, they demote the page, but that is not all they do. If too many pages are bad, they axe the site as a whole.  They also look at CTR (click through rate). They measure the statistics on how many clicks you get at any given position and you are in direct competition with your competitors on that one metric alone, and one metric being bad (usually excessively) can tank that page 10 pages deep if it's bad enough.  This also works the opposite. You can get to number 8 and gain positions by simply having the better page overall. Google is now headed towards ""Content is King"" as many used to harp in vain.  For the first time ever it has to do with the total of your site and how pleased people are when they find it. If it is that good, the social will reinforce the signals and links seal the deal.   If you have a nice site design, outstanding content that has social triggers in them, you can rank like gangbusters because if you have the first two right, the links will come with a little outreach."
SEO,3e4ghn,jcorkern,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:07:10 2015 UTC,"When you say that I will get misspelled versions from when I get branding links, do you mean that people will naturally misspell my company's name when they talk about it on their site? Or do you mean that as more people talk about my company (with the correct spelling), the more Google will recognize the company name and recognize misspellings on its own (without anyone misspelling it on the web)?"
SEO,3e4ghn,jcorkern,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:54:21 2015 UTC,"Both. Some people will misspell the brand in a blog post, a mention on social media and other platforms like forums.  Google also looks at text mentions and they are a powerful bonus in branding. Co-citations with or without an actual link also does well in helping to gain authority and trust, therefore making it easier to rank better. A co-citation would be like ""washing machines as rated by Consumer Reports"".  There are upwards of over 200 ranking signals that Google looks at and they use machine learning now, which is a fancy way of looking at many factors and using statistical significance to judge sites.  Take care of your site, your content and you should have no worries."
SEO,3e4ghn,jcorkern,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:17:18 2015 UTC,"I see. In your example of the co-citation, are you saying that it's better to get mentioned with another big name in the same sentence? Like if ""washing machines"" was a company name?  Also I've read different things about including misspelled versions of your company name in the meta description. Some people seem to think it's good, but others don't. But some of the posts I've read are from 2011 & it seems like a lot has changed since then."
SEO,3e4ghn,ispyty,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:37:04 2015 UTC,"No, it's more of your brand, replace ""Consumer Reports"" with your brand and the keywords you want to rank for in close proximity.  This means ""washing machines"" is the keyword you want to rank for.  Here is another example to give you a better idea. Let's say you sell dill pickles and your brand or company name is ""No bugs In My Veggies"", it would be perfectly natural for someone in comments, a forum or in a blog post to word something like this: ""No bugs In My Veggies has the best tasting pickles on the market as far as I am concerned"". that sentence would not be a stretch when someone likes your pickles. It's natural.  Let's look closer at the sentence.  ""No bugs In My Veggies has the best tasting pickles on the market as far as I am concerned""  You have the name of the company/brand and also have several keywords in a phrase ""best tasting pickles on the market"" in close proximity to it. It also has best tasting pickles, best pickles and so forth in it.  But it goes deeper: http://www.searchenginejournal.com/what-is-latent-semantic-indexing-seo-defined/21642/  Click this Google Search  Take a look at the results and read the titles and descriptions. Check and see if any other words are in bold in the descriptions other than what is in the search bar and you should have your Ah, Ha moment!  Google is a lot more accurate with language and I am now seeing longer, better written articles rank with little to no links, just some social when they have higher word counts, like over 2,500 words or more.  Even allowing for the falsehood of a machine learning actually thinking is patently false, it's almost shocking at how accurate they are now and i have been doing this since 2001 full time.   Hope this helps."

SEO,3e2404,brentwallac,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:18:31 2015 UTC,"best bet is to describe it in non technical terms - online marketing and offline marketing often have equivalences.  imagine you have been going to the same company for the same thing for 6 years. Then one day you go there / phone them up and it's the same company - they just no longer serve you and are putting on a fake accent.   They direct you to somewhere else - perhaps a different phone number. You call that number or go through that side door -  and the same person is there, because it is the same company... but now they will serve you...  would you still trust that company? It would even take a chunk of loyalty just to get the customer to make the 2nd call after having been shunned from the original location.  They might just google the product or service and go somewhere else -which would be more likely to be found above your new location cos the new site would not have authority.  Then - I'd point the person to the BBC.  The BBC have huge amounts of products and services but instead of creating a new website for each one, they put them all in the same place so you can trust all content under that umbrella - you then know your way around and can browse at ease - you go to /sport/ for sport or /news/ for news - all the while knowing which brand you are dealing with  online trust and offline trust work the same way - it's all networking and getting buzz around your online location.

SEO,3e2r3u,webeminence,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"Q1: IMHO, the best alt tags to use for your pictures are the ones that accurately describe what's on it to the search engines. Including some niche keywords that might drive qualified traffic to your site might be a good idea, however I wouldn't include the picture's category unless somebody looking for ""Musical Instruments"" in, say, Google Images could potentially look at your photo and think ""that is relevant to my query, I'll go ahead and click on it"".  Q2: I don't know exactly what you're trying to do with your images but I wouldn't necessary use the exact same picture in many different places with varied alt tags. What you could do, try to use the same alt but surround it with location-specific content, maybe that'll help the search engine to better localize your service and will also help your pictures appear in local organic results.  Q3: I'd say a smart thing to do is to make sure those images stay ""unique"", I don't know exactly how but I've seen so many cases where a great unique image that'd gone viral was re-used to get backlinks on other website (in somebody else's blog post). Making sure your pictures are shared on social networks (especially Twitter) is quite a good thing to get your pictures ranked too."

Or you can sell the leads directly for even more money if you're comfortable doing that.  C. Online Reputation Management. Find companies with negative reviews, complaints, etc. and charge them for removing them from the first couple pages. This is a newer market and you can charge through the nose.  With all this being said, if you want to ""freelance"", you really should focusing on creating a business. If you have no business skills, team up with someone who is good at sales."

Competing with India is next to impossible.   Depending on your area you should be able to pick up local seo jobs with an ongoing commitment for up to 6 mths for $500+ mth each within ~1-2mths. You'll need to target an industry or 2 or 7 and rank a couple of sites that you made to show that you can actually do the work. Post these sites on your own site along with a small case study.  Then hit up craigslist, local networking groups, etc. Again depending on you area you should be able to close on a client or two within the first 2 months and then new clients weekly until you decide to stop taking new clients. Rise repeat.  Or, you can go to eLance thing and play the race to the bottom game along with everyone else."

SEO,3dy90m,eoadams8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:29 2015 UTC,when I ran an agency getting anyone to pay was always a pain in the ass - cashflow was a nightmare and we were constantly having to chase people to pay their invoices.  Smaller businesses had lower budgets but generally paid on time. Larger businesses had huge budgets but getting their money from them was difficult. One big named record label owed us money for a year and ten days.  The only system that seemed to work was nagging and learning repeat client's invoicing schedules so we could ensure we were in the most recent pay run.  because it was client work and not product work it was case by case basis and so setting up recurring payments wasn't necessarily the right model.  We had to:   send the invoice phone to make sure they received the invoice and ask when we could expect to be paid 14 days before due payment phone again to ensure there have been no problems day before phone and make sure that you can expect payment the next day (probably) the next day when payment doesn't arrive phone and ask why resolve problem and repeat process for next payment run tear hair out and eat it cos you can't afford food this month

Not only is that good for continual exposure but it will get you a heap of quality backlinks too.  You don't always have to be making new content every week or two. Milk each one as much as you possibly can. Promoting content is hard in the beginning but once you've found your method/strategy you can pretty much repeat it with your following posts.

SEO,3dy9ul,neiluk123,3,Mon Jul 20 14:55:04 2015 UTC,"Huffington Post? BuzzFeed? They all rip from Reddit...  And yes, when a user submits a search query and Google sees multiple pieces of the same content it is going to try and determine which came first (among other engagement/usability metrics) and rank that higher, or not show the duplicates at all.  If the Reddit content isn't indexed Google won't know it's duplicate content."
SEO,3dy9ul,dallasmclaughlin,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:55 2015 UTC,"I have a few sites with dupe content penalties.  From my experience, dupe content penalties don't come into play until the content you're copying makes up a substantial portion of the origin site's content.  Since Reddit has so much content, and like any other big user-generated content website, the content you're copying is such a small drop in the bucket that you don't trip the dupe-content switch.   For instance, if you look at google's index like the big machine learning black box that it is, if you're just copying a small corpus of an entire website, you don't look much different than websites full of excerpts and the like.  My sites that are hit with dupe content penalties are generally copying content that other sites are copying as well, like usenet content, so my sites have a lot of overlap with other sites rehosting the same content."

SEO,3dwupy,T_DMac,5,Mon Jul 20 04:59:15 2015 UTC,"Several things here.  The industry standard for #1 ranking conversion is no where near 20%.  For targeted ads that are optimized maybe but for a random keyword that could be anything, absolutely not.   Let us look at some realistic numbers here.   The number one ranking for a keyword typically receives around 60% of the traffic (10,800) not 100% of the traffic. Assuming a VERY optimistic 5% conversion rate you would end up with 540 purchases. Not sure your business but compare your current conversion rates (assuming they are from ppc advertisement the conversion will go down.)  Assuming your average profit per shirt is $20 you could potentially make around $11,000 for that number one spot.  In all honesty a term like ""dope clothing"" would probably convert closer to 1% or under due to it not being a really specific term or a ""buy keyword"".  Assuming that you're looking at closer to $2200 bucks a month if you hit the #1 spot.    Now to comment on the SEO who pitched you.  RDWM is a stupid ass name but the company can get results. Ranking #1 for (Large City) SEO Expert is a pretty hard task because of competition.  However, There is 0% chance that you hit number 1 in the first month (or two) for ""dope clothing"" without black hat methods and realistically even with black hat methods I'd be surprised if he could rank it in the first month.  With all that said, assuming you're semi successful now and have the capital to grow you should be definitely looking for a SEO service and I'd suggest finding one that has a little more long term vision than 3 months in mind."

SEO,3dwupy,DukPep,2,Mon Jul 20 16:25:53 2015 UTC,"Without shooting down the idea of getting you to rank up near the top for ""dope clothing"", given that there isn't a flood of sites trying to compete for it....  It's completely achievable. That's not the reason why I would avoid this company.   It's 100% possible to get you to the top, with a lot of work of course. But what would make me worry is that the're guaranteeing you 1000 new sales per month. What if your site sucks? What if your aren't presenting your products properly, what if your price is higher than your competitors and you're not giving enough reason for them to pay it? All these things aren't included in SEO, it's all getting organic traffic, which this company never mentioned.   There's 2 major parts to make the whole:  Ranking & Marketing    You need to rank for good keywords, but the catch that people mostly avoid is that objectively you need to be the answer to people's questions. Because when people search for something like ""dope clothing"" they are probably looking for a specific brand with that name. So in order to be driving quality traffic, you need to place your website in front of the people who could be looking for what you have. The answer you are trying to be is something that can solve their problem, or fulfill their urge to buy.    Having a good salesman   Your Website is your 24 hour salesman, and your store. Your search results are your storefront.  What I mean is that you are going to entice people to click onto your site from your meta description and site title. Which is kinda like the big beautiful signs you'd see on a store front that make you want to see what they have inside. Then when they land on your site, you need to give them a reason to stay. That means you have about 2-5 seconds to catch their attention and then another 10 seconds after that to give them a reason to stay. Then once you've got them there, you need to give them a reason to buy what you have and be satisfied enough that they don't consider refunding you.     So What I'm getting at is that since this email promised you 1000 new sales a month for ranking for specific keywords, means you should stay away from it.   If there is more to this email and you already have all those other factors, then ignore what I've said. Because it can be done with a lot of work.  Edit:   tldr: They're a shitty salesman"

It's recommended to at least try to provide guidance, as what Google can show if given no guidance at all can be disjointed and weird. Even if you set a meta description, Google can do this, but your odds are better at message control if you set it.  And the meta is great marketing territory.

SEO,3dsbur,throwawayblahrah,3,Sat Jul 18 23:58:55 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI - If you do something to their site to cause them to drop that's negative SEO - so yeah that's blackhat/grayhat.  Now your strategy of boosting up your social profiles is a better course of action, but remember, no one OWNS the top positions, so if your only income is primary driven through Google, you should consider expanding your traffic sources in case they've got a natural higher authority site than you and will soon overtake you no matter what.  And if it's true it's a lower competition yet highly searched keyword, once they get wind of it, or anyone else gets wind of it, you'll have tons of more competitors jumping in or they'll really start targeting that keyword. So not only do you need to push up your social accounts and barnacle sites high enough, but you should also consider doing more proactive marketing just in case. Nothing last forever, especially top rankings, so take what you can now and invest in additional traffic sources to balance out any would be erosion.  Tip: Local Citations are one key to pushing up and controlling top positions."

That being said, I realize that IF i decide to go that route i need to do it sooner rather than later, Before they realize there's any more potential.

SEO,3dsbur,Jatacid,5,Sun Jul 19 05:58:51 2015 UTC,"Don't offer to buy the site imo.  They'll know it's you & just try harder.  Unless you offer a significant amount of cash - they'll just get an insight into the profitability.  Then if they sell out - it'll only be a matter of time bfeore the next competitor comes around.  Competition is healthy.  Learn to react and adapt to the industry.  Differentiate yourself from them in some way, make your way better.  You've been around longer you say? So show some numbers like (over 9002300 satisfied customers).  If you're happy to invest - then why not secure top bid for google's adwords? Start a bunch of campaigns aimed for your keywords and solidify your position at the 'top' with an advertisment.  Not necessarily to gain profit or traffic from it, but merely to be there, in the top spot.  Provide yourself more market presence and seem more legit than your competitor.  Alternatively, yeah you need to look at other avenues of marketing.  Are there sites/blogs that would feature you? Are there facebook campaigns you could run? Are there businesses that could affiliate with you?"

Also, how long do you think your clients will stay with you if you promise a service worth $750 and then deliver a service worth $200?"
SEO,3dpex7,DukPep,2,Sat Jul 18 04:29:58 2015 UTC,"I recently started with a startup that had been using White Label 90%+ of their fulfilment. The profit margins were tiny. It did help to build stronger relationships with clients, partners, and affiliates by providing quality results, and bought the founder enough time to grow enough to bring on a team.  I think it's a good placeholder system, but if you tried to model a business on it, you'd waste too many resources in account management and fulfilment costs."
SEO,3dpex7,GentlemanRaccoon,2,Sat Jul 18 07:25:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The client is expecting ROI on a spend of $750. So even a 1-1 ROI on $750 requires 3.5x ROI on that $200 you spend to white label. To get them actual, real return on spend would require 4-8x ROI on that $200, and that's a challenge even in low competition markets using low-skill labor.  That may be aggressive, especially when, quote you, you're ""not sure how useful they would be.""  People don't pay for a sales pitch. They pay for ROI."

But which would you rather have, having to be middle man for 20-30 people, talking to them on the phone, listening to their troubles - or - 20 to 30 websites, each making about $750 a month for you?  Those websites would be working while you slept - the clients would probably steal your sleep."
SEO,3dpex7,superm8n,2,Sat Jul 18 13:02:31 2015 UTC,"First problem is that you cannot get any kind of good SEO service for 200/month and there is the very real possibility that there would be negative consequences. Because you are outsourcing this to someone else and do not know how to tell if they are doing a good job you potentially put yourself in a very sticky situation with the client. If you were skilled enough to check their work and be on the phone with both them and the client constantly to make sure it is up to par maybe you could do it but at that point it would just be easier to do it yourself.   I think maybe a better way to approach this would be to get a variety of local marketing services and put it in a sort of package to you are the project manager for them. You could get an SEO, a social media manager, etc and that way you are bringing value to the client for being the middleman which you are not right now. Honestly, you probably arent going to find good SEO at 750 either, but I would think you would want more control over the service so you can get good review/referrals."
SEO,3dpex7,socialbutterisfly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:59:20 2015 UTC,You also have to consider that most website owners (with exceptions) aren't idiots and might find the service you're using or a similar one and simply cut you out as a middleman.

SEO,3dq09e,smartcoder,8,Sat Jul 18 09:12:07 2015 UTC,Running an SEO business is incredibly hard work. It isn't easy. So here is what you have to do.   Download a list of emails you can find anywhere and add it to your mailing list. Find a script that takes Whois information and add it to your mailing list. With your mailing list just keep on spinning the same email script After you made your website made purely with Adobe Flash. Purchase scrapebox and just run it all the time. Make sure you ask people to link to your site in exchange to link too theres. Make another website that says you won an award. and make up 2 winners up. Hire someone in India to do all the work for you. Your investment will surely pay for itself.   note: Don't do the above.

Google any one of those industries plus your local city, and you can see how weak the PR's and DA for the websites on the front page are.  Look at how weak the page titles and <h1> tags are.

Also try to optimise the page for as many long-tail research based keywords as possible so you also catch people on the SERPS. Let others link back to that useful article.

By implementing smart on-site design and using good copy, both of these improved and lead to better SERPS.  I say this because although I can see Microtasking being used to knock off a competitor from rankings or create artificial demand, the problem still remains - is this sustainable? Are you getting such improvement in profits/ revenue that it is worth the time, money, and associated risk.  Have I got this right? Anyone feel differently?"

The Bots are able to create or modify content on the site (Accounts, Comments, Custom Pages).

Sites with 1 million+ likes that aren't Nike, etc are most likely full of fake/disinterested likes BUT the majority of people don't know or care. They just see a crowd and want to be in it.

So that new sale on copper buttons, yea, only 13 people of the 100 who follow you were given a chance to see it. The reason why it only got 2 likes was because of that 13, 2 people happened to be in front of their computer when your post popped through their feed.   The takeaway? Facebook is a popularity contest, not a great source of traffic (not anymore anyway) or a path to high rankings.

Otherwise, you're just competing for space against their friend from HS who just had a baby and whose photo got 300 likes and comments from everyone they ever knew.  AND the people you're doing an exchange with are unlikely to comment, share or become your customers.  So having fake likes actually hurts your performance in even the streams of your genuine fans, because it brings down your interactions."

So far there are no significant changes - even when a fair few of those links were broken or poor quality. This kind of action in the past has always been positive - but it appears recent updates to Google may have made it smarter about link profiling without the need to manually tag nofollow/dofollow
SEO,3dh4us,yhorian,2,Thu Jul 16 07:58:05 2015 UTC,This is pretty standard these days. Comments/reviews should be nofollow so that can't be gamed by spinners etc.

You'll always need more traffic (i.e. better SEO) and later on you'll need to focus on making most out of the traffic (i.e. higher conversions)  In particular, what I see in e-commerce, prices are a crucial factor affecting conversion rates. Because visitors/consumers mostly keep several tabs open before they buy a product and they compare those prices vs. each other and go through the most affordable ones.  Therefore, in order increase the outcome of well-deserved SEO, companies can automatically track their competitor prices and make sure they get convincing conversions."

SEO,3dhj9l,socialbutterisfly,0,Thu Jul 16 22:30:10 2015 UTC,Google wants to provide a result where people can find what they are looking for. If someone is bouncing straight back to google after little time and never converting this is just as big of an indicator of poor quality as any of the traditional SEO things. These really do go together - Your site needs to be easy to use and clear to understand and you need SEO to bring in the right people who will interact with it well. I really do not see a line between these things the way you are describing it.

SEO,3deadj,canirank_mel,2,Wed Jul 15 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"uuu I like seo questions:D With your permission, here are my answers:  1 Yes. They announced it long time ago: https://moz.com/blog/google-bing-confirm-twitter-facebook-influence-seo + historically there have been numerous tests that would show organic traffic increase in the same time articles were liked/shared. You can run a facebook ads campaign and test for yourself. If your future employer asks how this works, you can smile, because no one knows exactly. To quote Rand, it's correlation not causation: https://moz.com/blog/facebook-twitters-influence-google-search-rankings . Sorry for giving you old references, but they were among the first ones who explained it the best.  2 Go to Analytics > Behavior > Site Content > All Pages. Select the last 6 months (or 1 year) as the time period and do a split: top pages (ones that get a lot of traffic) ; medium pages (satisfying amount - here you can watch for peaks and identify trends in seasonality) and under-performing pages. The consolidation should work backwards: last ones will become a top priority for consolidation (you can consult with your publishers), medium-medium and top pages should only get a few paragraphs (especially if they are evergreen content or they were published a looong time ago and things changed). Alternatively you can choose landing pages instead of all pages and filter by secondary dimension ""organic"". This will be your job, but by doing it the first way will show you have an online marketing focused vision. I would only no-index the pages generated after a search on the page, and maybe the tags after a thorough analysis.  3 Yes, it is. You can read more about how often to do it and how much content you should add. PS here: if an article is ranking number 1 for a good keyword (has been doing excellent historically), don't touch it. The ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" principle applies.  4 If it's panda it should be on a website level. I don't believe ""thin content"" is referred to just a few articles but even so, this is weird for a large publishing site. Are they aggregators? It's hard for be to believe that a site producing 100% original content gets penalized. What message did they get in the webmaster tools console? How are they sure the penalty wasn't lifted by now? One solution can be to hire 2, 3 editors and write as much as you can, long, high quality articles that will respond to queries and fix people's problems.  5 Again, workflow. This word is so different from seo to seo I cannot describe it. But here is my answer: analytics and webmaster tools when you wake up, screaming frog for anything on page/technical, and then insert your preferred link analysis tool (ahrefs, majestic), or reporting & combined (raven, moz, brightedge, cognitiveseo). For all other tools everyone is so interested in, say : IT DEPENDS. Site speed from google page insights or pingdom, technical duplicate from angular marketing, subdomain search from pentest, audit tools http://alanbleiweiss.com/seo-blog/seo/my-top-40-favorite-seo-audit-tools-resources-list, mobile tools, content tools, keyword research tools.......... You got the point :)   I believe that a good seos can be flexible and always a bigger site is a bigger challenge. And we love challenges. Don't be afraid, ""Say yes, then learn how to do it later"" as Richard Branson says.   Have absolute confidence in yourself and you will succeed. Good luck!"

If you're paranoid about bounce rates, create some chat events in Google Analytics and send them for e.g. asking a question, sharing a photo/link, answering a chat and so on.

SEO,3ddngo,moolikeacow,2,Wed Jul 15 14:34:40 2015 UTC,"This ALWAYS happens when forums do this. Look at the SEO industry as a whole right at this very moment. It's not an accidental phenomenon. Right now the SEO forums are mostly dried up specifically because everyone has turned to skype and more recently slack for faster communication, a bit more privacy, and a tighter community.  Your forum participation will continue to die unless you are actively posting highlights of the log or have someone taking good chunks of the skype chat, summarizing it and posting it to the forum as a separate post for non-chat users. Or you get rid of the chat - problem is since the chat is most likely active and popular there is going to be backlash at some level if you do. What you've done is created a situation where your forum is now irrelevant.  It's like switching from 28.8K Modem to Broadband from the user's experience, faster communication - making the old way go the way of the dodo... You have some tough decisions to make."

If you look around at the providers on Elance (soon to be Upwork I guess) you can find great writers for very cheap. Not quite as cheap as iWriter but not that much more.  I once owned a website about time management and managed to hire a man who had been teaching time management workshops for 10 years to write for me. The price? $10 for 500 words.  I've also hired many other great writers at similar price points, including a doctor in the Philippines to write medical articles for a health-related site. Less than $15 per 500 words for that one, IIRC.  My point is that if you put some effort into searching for candidates, you can find ones that are great writers and highly qualified but haven't yet learned how to market themselves at higher prices for their writing. The best ones, I've found, are people who are highly skilled writers and either 1) simply don't know they can charge higher prices for their writing or 2) are just starting out in freelance writing and are desperate enough for reviews of their services that they are willing to write for cheap just to establish their new accounts on the freelancing website."

As a bonus, you'll actually have meaningful KPIs you can track!"
SEO,3de9dn,moolikeacow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:10 2015 UTC,"It has to do also with the time on page before hitting back.   I saw an example of this that was awful once that was a super useful site, it just displayed a really simple piece of information on 1 page, like ""is so and so dead yet"" and sites like that because of instant confirmation of what you wanted to find out were having astronomical bounce rates even though they were working perfectly they got downed in rank.   However, long scrolling squeeze pages don't appear to have this problem any more than a multi page site."
SEO,3dejil,Gaurav117,3,Wed Jul 15 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly how either of those things work.   Do follow simply means you are telling Google that the link in question is part of your site or you intend Google to go that way, and no follow means you want them to do the opposite.   In no way ever does it mean that Google is doing what you tell them.   There is sufficient evidence to believe that no follow links also pass link juice in some way, and that Google actually seems to be looking at ratio and spread between no follow and do follow along with type of link and origin site in some regard to try to catch cheating, but is actually crediting all kinds of links in some way toward the overall link profile."
SEO,3dejil,omnicidial,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"Hi, I dont disagree with you but whenever any1 wants to acquire a link then he/she expects it to be a dofollow.  E.g. A and B are 2 very different sites in the same niche, if B wants a backlink then he would expect A to pass a dofollow link. Now here my question is Why A would pass that link when he knows that he can make it a nofollow and secure his link juice to strengthen his own inner pages..."
SEO,3dejil,omnicidial,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:01:57 2015 UTC,"Google also seems to give value to outbound links to some degree and boosts some pages based on the way they link outbound.   It seems like the operating theory that people used to go by a lot was to put less outbound links than internal but that linking to authority sites wasn't harmful.   An example of that might me linking the Wikipedia definition of something on a page below several of your internal links.   It doesn't matter really if you no follow a link, Google doesn't have to consider that, so just ignore that flag entirely for purposes of this example.   Look at it the way Google might. If 2 identical pages exist, but 1 had 1 less link that actually made it less useful and harder to find information, which page should rank higher?  Outbound links to places like Wikipedia have long been considered to not have negative impact on your site.  The outbound links that will damage your site are outbound links to sites with a lower pagerank than your site or to sites that are not relevant to the keyword somehow."

The minification/bundling is hit and miss with some themes, so look into Better Wordpress Minify and Autoptimize to handle some of that if W3 has issues and just use it for caching Analytics - Google Analytics by Yoast Most analytics plugins just have a place to stick your tracking code, Yoast's comes with a ton of options and includes custom dimensions in the paid version Sharing/Promote new posts - JetPack Comes with a ton of useful features.

SEO,3db6eb,gizamo,3,Wed Jul 15 03:39:53 2015 UTC,"Wordpress, Weebly and Wix are just PHP backed content management systems; all three do the exact same thing (just in a different way) by allowing you to easily update and manage your site without messing with code.   In terms of SEO, Wordpress gets a better rep because of the ability to customize your permalink structure, (a good url structure is great for SEO!) and optimize your site for speed. (Googlebots look at that too)  Also Wordpress has thousands of plugins that helps you optimize your site for search engines. Notice I said 'helps' because ultimately optimizing your site for certain keywords and phrases is up to you and not Wordpress, Wix or Weebly.  Tbh, I wouldn't say Wordpress is superior because you can rank highly using any of the three platforms. However, I must say Wordpress does make it much harder to get SEO completely wrong because they pay a lot more attention to that aspect than the other two.  Honetly search engines (nor visitors at that) don't care if you're with Wordpress, Wix, or Weebly. They are just looking for a relevent site according to what a person is searching for."

I just moved my site to wordpress and found out for the past 2 to 3 years i was missing out a lot. dont do the same make the switch now and start to learn more on wordpress its easy but not a drag and drop like weebly. The advantages of wordpress are much superior like dotnetbrit commented previous. Here are some of the key advantages.   In wordpress you can download yoast plugin or all in one seo then once you set it up, you wont have to worry much about on-page seo as the plugins automatically detects your Tags, Keywords and so on. In weebly you have to do it all by yourself on each page. so better let the plug-in on wordpress do the work so you can focus more on creating amazing content. There is plug-ins in wordpress also to optimize your pictures SEO which a lot of people seems to to forget and is very important. Wordpress is definitely more flexible to use than weebly. Themes: There is a lot of different free themes out there you can install and use for your site, weebly mostly have the same them just different colors and pictures.   There is definitely many more points than what i mentioned. But definitely make the switch now and dont do like i did because eventually you will make the switch anyway. so its better to do it now and learn faster about it as it will help you a lot.  If you have any questions about weebly, ask me. Wordpress am still learning but its much freaken better so far in terms of everything, the only good point of weebly is the drag and drop which gets beginner to like at first (am on of them)"
SEO,3db6eb,sameer-25,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:34:16 2015 UTC,"I have actually been using WordPress for years, and I love almost everything about it. I have managed about 5 different sites and built three myself.  I have never used Wix or Weebly, but I feel like they have to be getting better, to compete. Right?  The reason I asked is, I often recommend website platforms to business owners, and I wanted a definitive answer on why someone with little free time would want to go with WordPress over something they can set up in minutes and manage easily, like Weebly. Obviously, SEO is a huge piece of having a website in the first place, unless the business is planning on driving all traffic via paid campaigns, which would be strange - to me.  To me, the biggest advantage of WordPress is customization and scale-ability. Also, it's open source, so the business owner always retains the code - which, to me, is very important.  But, I think a lot of business owners simply don't have the time to manage a beast like WordPress, because it does require frequent maintenance, and probably at least some technical skills.  But, you had some good insight in your post about flexibility, and as others mentioned, plugins do help quite a bit.  Thanks for your insight."

SEO,3dcqva,SadieDouse,2,Wed Jul 15 06:32:03 2015 UTC,"I think this one can help....  To generate traffic to your site you will need to get in touch with the bloggers in you niche as these are the people who are already interested in what you have to say.  Writing good content is fine. But what's the use, if you only write and nobody catches it. This will be a total waste of your time.  Here is the quick tip:  Find bloggers like you in your niche, who are also struggling to get traffic. To find them, just make a simple google search for your niche related keyword and check out what you get on Google SERPS. Now straight away jump to the Google's 3rd page and here you will find the list of people who are in your niche and struggling to rank. Connect with them and most likely they will reply you back, as these are the once who are already interested in your niche and this way you will find your target audience.  Tell me is it worth giving a try....  Thanks, hope this helps"

Choose bloggers who generate lot of social shares, you can find this by simply visiting there blog and see how many facebook, twitter or pinterest shares they generate on every post.  THus if you send these bloggers your gift items then you are sure to generate good and targeted traffic.  Moreover create a buzz on instagram and pinterest. Make an account there and follow people and there followers that already has boards related to your stuff. This way you can get a lot of traffic to your site who will be ready to buy.  Don't forget to keep on posting your awesome stuff because this will generate much more likes and will be a free marketing to you."

SEO,3dcqva,dotnetbrit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:02:47 2015 UTC,Unfortunately psychographic targeting only works when you have a clear demographic and can produce enticing enough content. There's also the problem in that ROIs if you're not directly converting out of your content are dreadful (essentially it is an awareness campaign and there's much cheaper options than Facebook for that).  I'm really looking for sponsored blog/site opportunities that I can help use to push brand awareness.
SEO,3dcqva,Tuilere,2,Wed Jul 15 16:14:54 2015 UTC,"Taboola and Outbrain both work for that.  If your content is dreadful, your options are limited. Crap in, crap out, you know? You can't polish a turd or get people excited about it."
SEO,3dcqva,dotnetbrit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:18:33 2015 UTC,"No absolutely, the problem is that certain industries don't lend themselves to 'viral' content that people love to share. Think law firm.

That being said, once you verify your address you should be fine. If you are in a competitive niche/space, you may need to do more Local SEO(just build profiles on the big directories, i.e. Yoast) and encourage reviews(ESPECIALLY TO GOOGLE+!!).

There are about 4 other local businesses who do the exact same thing I do. I've got the twitter page, facebook page, google+ along with adwords express and a yelp page.   Good thing my real job allows me time online all day every day to manage all of this. I'll definitely look at getting on some directories though.

It's possible - but kinda unlikely - that a bot's sending fake requests to Google Analytics without bothering to load up your site. Do the users load up all the elements (CSS, images, JS etc)? Or is it just the homepage, followed by a GA hit?   If they look like real users, there's a chance they might be, but loaded via an iframe, or a botnet, or something else kinda crazy.   Finally, is the traffic distributed throughout the site, on a particular page, or just the homepage? It's been a while since I last saw something similar, but I have seen traffic spikes from e.g. a blog post whose keywords happened to coincide with a major news story from minutes earlier.

SEO,3d90yb,viva8887,9,Tue Jul 14 13:15:59 2015 UTC,"First off understand it isn't you and while people are pouncing on your fiverr comment, I've had similar issues with highly reputable and well paid consultants, which is what pissed me off enough to enter the ring myself.   Do they have the google certs? They are free to study and pass, yet many of the consultants I've encountered don't have them. That's insta-fail for me. They should be able to evaluate your site Automated tooling makes this a breeze, so there's no excuse for them not to be able to provide you with a report on your current activities and give a good evaluation of where the problems are. We love doing these because, like a mechanic doing a free inspection, we know we'll find something, somewhere even if it is just a recommendation for on-going activities. This may be free or there may be a minimal charge. Be sure to look for specifics, reporting on ""x number of broken links"" is just the tooling, reporting on the layout or issue with a specific page is more likely to be them actually doing some investigation work. Actual actionable objectives They should be able to point to actionable activities that are specific to your site. That means going beyond simply saying they'll ""perform SEO on your pages"" and talk about the unique needs: ""I'll do x to your testimonial page and create 7 new landing pages on the topics of blah, foo and bar"". If they dodge specifics and talk about a 'holistic approach to SEO', run like the wind. Bill for tasks, not mysterious management fees The happiest day for a SEO consultant is when they get to write an invoice for a monthly retainer for ""Generic SEO tweaking"". Don't let 'em. They should be able to point to some of those specifics mentioned in #3 and put an hourly cost to them and bill for that. It is fine if you've already agreed a monthly or periodic fixed fee, but it should always include details of what was done beyond ""helped improve/maintain rankings"", which is nearly always more accurately described as ""scrambled to do 30mins of work before our meeting to make it look like I did something"". Keyword research Real quick way to sort out the time wasters is to have them do keyword research. An SEO consultant/agency should easily be able to tell you what you're ranking on currently and some suggestions on what you should be ranking on given your product/service/industry. The time wasters all seem to expect you to tell them what you want to rank for, while none of the legitimate people I know would struggle to provide this over an afternoon, if asked. It should be provided as part of #2, but by itself can be a quick litmus test."

SEO,3d90yb,ramblerandgambler,2,Wed Jul 15 16:20:19 2015 UTC,"It depends on a few things, but the bottom line is this;    Are you happy with their services they provide for $80 a month?   Obviously the answer is 'no', but I'm just trying to give you a way to think this through that makes sense.    SEO is a weird field to be in, TBH. The term 'SEO' is thrown around a lot and it's often mis-used. Many small business owners think that you hire a guy to do SEO and then it's done. You seem to be a little ahead of the game because you (seemingly) recognize the need for constant attention and updates. That's good! Many of my clients in the past have not recognized this and chewed me out 6months after our contract ended because their SEO went to crap with a Google update.    Next, I would suggest you think about ROI and budgetting for your project. Ask some SEO professionals for a consultation or estimate. Consider how much you can allow for SEO and what ROI you would need to make it worth your money/time. Would increasing your conversion rate to 5% double your investment into SEO? Would it have to be 10%? How long would you let somebody touch your site before requiring they meet your KPI?    I would also suggest not being afraid of your SEO people knowing that you don't know much about SEO. They can tell anyway. Most of my small business clients have a timid, almost defensive attitude about stuff. It's like they don't want you to know that they aren't an expert at something. Bigger companies don't have this attitude. They accept that they don't know everything and as long as you're doing what they need you to do for the money agreed upon, they don't really care. The important thing is driving traffic and conversions, right? If your $80 a month person can get your site where you want it, then use them. At the end of the day it's all about getting the work you need done as quickly as possible for as cheaply as possible. I'd say go figure out what you need and meet with some people.    If you have any questions, feel free to keep asking!"

Did you hire someone to do a specific thing or someone to manage your entire online presence?

If you're looking for someone to help your business grow using online marketing, you can go more off of their proposal. We write ours to serve as a marketing plan. Everything is laid out so you know exactly what we're doing and why. I've seen proposals from companies we've replaced and they were very general, so I'd say you can tell a lot about a firm/person from their proposal.  And with SEO you absolutely get what you pay for.

Freelancer sucks(overseas companies posing as US-based with verified addresses), Fiverr is dangerous, and anything in-person will charge 5x what is necessary. Using the phrase ""Please start your proposal with ""XXX"" is a great way to filter out the offshore companies, and even companies that have outsourced the bidding process. Also, you do get what you pay for. You can't expect to pay $250 per month and get ranked unless you are in a really low-competition space.  Edit: LOL! I got a few down-votes for the shameless plug. ;) Honestly, if you are having a hard time finding a good SEO person/company, just learn more about SEO(and what others have accomplished through their SEO campaigns, i.e. examples, case-studies) and restart your search for the right person/people. It's so easy to find the bullshitters out there, once you feel more comfortable with the expectations.  I recommend me because I am me, and I have every interest in doing so! :) Also, I'm not terribly expensive, but I'm also not an asshole.

SEO,3d990w,DRumbauskas,4,Tue Jul 14 14:38:37 2015 UTC,"I think your reading into the terms a little too much. The bounce rate is solely the percentage of single page ""sessions"" (visits).   A session can be defined however you'd like - but by default - GA tracks a session until the user leave the page or there is 30 minutes of inactivity.   If you want to specifically track one page visits under 30 mins then you can can set up a goal defining number of page visits and duration.  You can get a quick overview of this under Audience>Behavior>Engagement and you can see the number of sessions & page views per timeframe.   Is there any reason your interested in 30 minutes? Unless you have an information heavy blog, thats a pretty long time for engagement."

Some consider it a good idea to include only the target keyword in the URL, while titles and h1 tags should be more descriptive. Plenty of sites rank very well with junky looking automated URLs, however, and it’s possible Google doesn’t use the text in the URL at all.

SEO,3d92vo,TheMacMan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:38:46 2015 UTC,"I believe what you are seeing is bot spam. Bots actually visit your site site the sessions are logged with a valid hostname.   The only way that I am aware of the prevent bot spam is by adding the referrers to an Exclude referrer filter. I enter the spam referring domains as they show up using regex. The value in the filter is formatted as follows:  (spamsite1\.com|spamsite2\.com|spamsite3\.com)   You can just keep adding new domains to the string until you reach the character limit for the field, then create another similar filter and repeat.   Note: You only need to exclude the root domains in your filters, that will take care of any related subdomains as well.  I am not aware of any way that your bot spam issue could be effecting your poor rankings in Google SERPs.   Edit: Made the regex string code so that it would properly display the backslashes."

SEO,3d5egh,Tuilere,6,Tue Jul 14 00:53:36 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a necessity. I do believe that all web design agencies should have some grasp of basic SEO best practices.  Some of the sites I've looked at have been truly shocking from a technical SEO perspective.   But SEO at an advanced level is actually quite complex. Web designers are great for the code of a site and graphical resources.   I don't think it would be reasonable to expect them to have expert knowledge of SEO as well...
SEO,3d5egh,sambarnes90,3,Mon Jul 13 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"A web designer (responsible for visuals and infographics) wouldn't necessarily provide SEO services. However, a proper web designer who creates, designs, and engineers the website should definitely create the best website for search engine optimization. If you were using the services of a digital marketing agency to create a website from scratch - you would expect the website designer to take into account the website's search engine ranking."
SEO,3d5egh,ShaynaKeith,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:59:38 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the agency, what you are paying for and the designers understanding of SEO. I work at a web dev company who offers SEOs services, but it is not our primary service. I am not a part of the design process, so unless they bring me in to touch up some stuff, it up to the designers to implement an SEO work.  I think our designers do as much as they can that isn't overly time consuming, but they aren't keeping up with all the tips and best practices to create ""the best website for search engine optimization"" like canonical tags, schema tags or sometimes alt tags. Because those aren't things that play apart site functionality (except for alt tags and the blind). That's not their job. Their job is to make a functional website that the consumer wants. Outside of some basic SEO work, it is then up to the web owner to find their way of ranking the site. Whether that be by learning themselves or paying someone else to do it. But I do believe the site should be built with a proper CMS so that the owner does have the chance to optimize on their own."

SEO,3d5egh,DaveLLD,2,Mon Jul 13 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"Concur.  I do content marketing, SEO, and some other related things.  I build sites once in a while, when I'm confident I can handle the work and put out a worthwhile product that both client and client's customers will be pleased with.  If someone wants more than I can comfortably deliver, isn't willing to pay for the work at a reasonable level, or doesn't know what the hell they really want, I have a few reputable designers with whom I've personally worked and whom I trust that I can hand them off to.  That preserves my relationship with the client because I'm not the one coming in over what the client thinks the budget should be (always insufficient) and I've referred them to a professional who can meet their needs, so long as they're willing to pay for it.  Sometimes, in this world, the best thing you can say is ""I don't know, but I know a guy who does.  Let me put you in touch with him."""

I do work with web for over a decade, but most of the time I worked alone or for very small and somewhat disfunctional agencies. This is my opinion based on my experience.   This is a case where the ""ideal world"" conflicts with the ""real world"".  The ideal is that, if a company have no qualified people to do SEO, they should not offer it.  The reality however is that clients see some buzzword, they hear everyone is doing that and they want it too, even if they don't really know what it is.  Facebook, blogs, mobile, responsive, SEO, the word doesn't matter. The client wants it, everyone is offering and if you say you don't do it they will find someone else that does it. Can your business handle that? How picky can you be while still paying the bills?  I think the best way of dealing with this from a business owner point of view is educate the client, but don't lose the project.   Usually I get away saying I do ""basic SEO"" (mainly on-page stuff). That gets pass people who just want a buzzword. Then I explain to them that ""real SEO"" is a more complex process and not what the general market is offering."

Otherwise:   ""Because a penalty can arise from so many areas, and for so many reasons, it can sometimes be difficult to pinpoint exactly what has happened. This checklist will help you narrow down the possibilities, determine whether and why your site has been penalized, and take the necessary steps to fix it.   Check Google Analytics for Traffic Data: If one day, your traffic seems normal, and the next day there's a sharp drop-off (or possibly no traffic at all), that's a pretty good indicator of a possible penalty. Check Whether Your Site is Still Indexed: Go to Google and type in site:yourdomain.com. If just a few of your site's pages show up, you may be looking at a penalty problem. However, you may also simply have a problem with your robots.txt file. Check that for errors first before you assume the worst. If, when you perform the site: search, nothing at all shows up, your site has been removed from the index. At this point, it's pretty safe to assume a penalty is in place, and you have a lot of work ahead of you. Check for a Recent Google Algorithm Update: If Google has rolled out another big update the likes of Panda (quality) or Penguin (overoptimization), depending on what the update targeted, and how your website is set up, your site may be collateral damage. Moz keeps track of all Google algorithm updates, so you should be able to correlate an update roll-out date to the time when you noticed an issue with your site. Once you've determined that Google has released an update, find out what the update targeted, and how to address it. For example, when Google released the Panda update, they explained that it was meant to target low-quality content. In order to recover from a Panda hit, website owners had to increase the quality of content on their sites. If there's been no recent update, you can rule that out, and continue looking for other possibilities. Check Google Webmaster Tools: If, instead of a penalty arising from an algorithm update, your site has been levied with a manual penalty, you should see a notification in your Google Webmaster Tools (GWT) account. Google will notify you whether they've detected any non-compliance with their webmaster guidelines. The nature of the warning should be an indication of what you need to do to fix the problem. For example, if you receive an unnatural link warning, use a program such as Screaming Frog to take inventory of your backlinks, and determine whether there are any spammy or overoptimized links pointing to your site.""

Do you know if your site has ever used cloaking to display different content to ""real"" users vs Googlebot? If so, the code responsible may now be failing and causing the relevant error.   Set your user agent to Googlebot (many many guides out there on doing this) and start debugging from there. Possibly an idea to turn off cloudflare first to figure out whether it's a problem with your config there.

SEO,3d4q8m,Tuilere,2,Mon Jul 13 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"backlinks and SEO signals from UK based websites, customers, and geo-locations create the relevancy in Google's eyes that this site should also rank in the UK version. Depending on the industry it MIGHT make sense to have a dedicated section to the UK, or a mini-site or a completely separate site. But that's down the road and more work. First step is to get SEO signals from the UK so Google knows ""hey people from the UK are linking and talking/blogging about it, so it's UK relevant as well."" If you can't get that traction, then a separate site might be necessary."

No point is messing around with 301 redirects or any back and forth, potentially losing 15% of link juice or whatever. '.coms' are prevalent in all countries. Just make sure you go into WMT (if you dare use that) and set your geo-location. I dunno how to do that since I'm too scared to login to WMT... http://i.imgur.com/Zw4PXNg.jpg"
SEO,3d32sc,MercenaryCarter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:50:45 2015 UTC,"Currently the SEO is extremely lousy so losing a little juice won't matter much at this point.  The niche I'm working with is at least 60%+ .co.uk when I google it using the UK Google.  Top 3 are .co.uk as well.    Are there any negatives to having a duplicate site, one being a .com and one being a .co.uk?  I'm guessing that may make it harder to optimize for SEO but I see advantages for having both so now I'm conflicted."
SEO,3d32sc,MercenaryCarter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:54:58 2015 UTC,"Yes there are negatives to having pure duplicate content - it's called ""supplemental results"". The TLD doesn't matter of what's ranking, it's the backlinks to the domain/page that create the relevancy. Those backlinks' geo location determine the website being linked to's geo relevancy.  Example if Radio.fm has tons of UK based backlinks, and websites with servers in the UK, and visitors from primarily the UK, Radio.fm is going to rank higher in the UK in the SERPs for it's targeted keywords, regardless of the '.fm' tld, since Google has determined that the site is about stuff in the UK by analyzing all their signals."

I also 99.99% of the time go with .com version of the website. I did an analysis within SERPWoo and found that the general order of websites in the top 30 goes like this (globally):  1) .com 2) .org 3) .co.uk 4) .com.au 5) .net | 10) .edu | 22) .info | 24) .us  More info: http://www.wickedfire.com/shooting-the-shit/183908-sucks-registration.html#post2252352  So .com and .org are the way for me. It's not that Google gives preference to one over the other, it's the people that do the linking like you and me that do, hence why the out of the top 30 positions you see primarily .com and .org."
SEO,3d32sc,sameer-25,2,Tue Jul 14 15:40:17 2015 UTC,do not use duplicate site. rather using duplicate redirection is best. Redirect your co.uk domain to .com and do not forget to set geo location UK in your Google webmaster tool.

In the early days of the internet this was easy due to the novelty and lack of competition  Frankly, im a non believer of purely affiliate/middleman models and like to build real world businesses that online feeds through sales. This is harder but long term far more solid.  If you have learned the whole process from ranking serps, getting healthy ctr, a healthy cr and train people who will do the leg work its do able.

There are many options to create new URL's: 1. site.com/product-page-url 2. site.com/category/product-page-url 3.  site.com/sub-category/product-page-url 4.  site.com/category/sub-category/product-page-url Main thing is Keep your URL as short as possible. So it will be better to go with 1st Option rather than making URL's too long.

The trick then, is to make him see the value. AdWords currently has the spend $25 to get $75 credit coupon so a great way to entice clients is share that with them and have them run a test at $25 cost for $100 worth of ads.  The problem is that it is a ton of upfront work, conversion and landing page optimization, analytics micro and macro goal tracking because that $100 will disappear in the blink of an eye and the metrics you get from it are what will sell the ongoing service to your client.   However ""We spent $100 in ads and got $100+X in revenue"" is a compelling argument, you just need to have the experience and groundwork in place beforehand otherwise you'll have that ad spend and mediocre metrics or even negative ROIs which is obviously a major embarrassment if you're trying to sell adwords services.

Look at this as an opportunity to educate these clients.  The problem with these clients is that they have no idea of the lifetime value of a customer, cost per lead, cost per acquisition, etc. Since this is a friend, you can have open and honest conversations on why they have no interest in learning these fundamentals about their business.  These conversations will help you overcome objections by similar clients. This will be an uphill battle but you can also offer this as an additional service. Maybe a better way to communicate your services is through ROI reports.  Client's eyes seem to glaze over when you begin to discuss social media and Google analytics metrics. Client's tend to respond better when you are able to tell them they spent $100 to make a $1000 in profits."

Check out the excellent post by [https://moz.com/blog/keyword-research-for-the-modern-customer-journey] (Matt Gratt) (another Moz post). It outlines the customer journey including those using informational search terms. He uses a tool called Term Explorer in his keyword research which may help, though I have never used it.   Note: my job is not in SEO but in content marketing but I always do keyword research around questions in order to identify customer pain points so I can write specific landing pages and blog posts that address what the customer wants.

I know you can get a couple of organic competition analysis for free on Termxplorer which works reasonably well.  Ideally though you want to dig into the results for that keyword yourself.  Organic competition is really hard to measure because there are sooooo many different factors to take into account.  Do your own research. Could you make a better page than the current top 10? Could you attract better links? Would a user choose your page over the others of they could just see it?   If yes to all the above then you have a chance. Even then there is still no guarantee!

Referral bot spam uses the same method that an actual legitimate web hit uses, without having to hit your server. They can simply increment through the various combinations of tracking codes and just keep hitting them. Blocking at the server level does nothing, you have to block in Google Analytics.  The Exclude bots setting on the View is meant for more ""grey"" types of robots and that list is maintained by an international consortium, not Google. Currently to my knowledge it doesn't help at all for the type of Referral Spam we've been seeing. I use this method to maintain a set of filters across 500+ GA Accounts (it's as much of a nightmare as it sounds): http://viget.com/advance/removing-referral-spam-from-google-analytics"

Whatever you do, even if you have to do it manually, take the top 1000 most visited pages in Analytics and make absolutely sure they all redirect properly.  Then, if you want to save some time, redirect the less popular pages to the relevant category or let them 404 with full navigation on the new site structure."

SEO,3cu7fh,chadkimball,0,Fri Jul 10 20:57:39 2015 UTC,I fully agree with this. would be worth it to get really granular with these redirects. Just hire someone offshore to do the grunt work. People linking to you might remove their links if they see blanket redirects to category pgs etc.. so if you can avoid that do it.   You can also look at your top 1000 links according to moz PA or majestic TF/CF and make sure those redirect properly
SEO,3cu7fh,Tuilere,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"It's always worth it to get granular with redirects.  Generally, the best practice on a content migration is to keep a spreadsheet of some kind and map-as-you-go, one-to-one. Alas, that ship seems to have sailed in this instance (lesson learned).   So it's the harder way this time."
SEO,3cu6gx,Rept4r7,3,Fri Jul 10 20:23:32 2015 UTC,A 'good' average bounce rate is really hard to judge. Blogs are often much higher than other sites.  Ecommerce sites are a little lower and service sites might be a little lower again.  There are so many factors at play.  In terms of helping to reduce it I've written a fair bit about it here. It's easier to link to that than type the whole thing out in a reddit comment!  Just let me know if you have any other questions!
SEO,3cu6gx,sambarnes90,2,Fri Jul 10 20:32:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I read your article and you wrote that ""Bounce rate isn’t an SEO ranking factor."" Do you really think this is true? If so, why?"
SEO,3cu6gx,sambarnes90,2,Fri Jul 10 21:20:02 2015 UTC,Because Google have stated repeatedly that they don't use bounce rate as a ranking factor.  But user experience is really important to them.  I would guess that the use bounce rate as part of a much bigger metric that they use to measure how users interact with your site.   But bounce rate by itself... Not a ranking factor.
SEO,3cu6gx,sambarnes90,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:37:55 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for Google saying that they don't use bounce rate? I realize they aren't tapping GA or using the complete bounce rate metric. I think they are just tracking it through the search result clicks to better the SERPs.
SEO,3cu6gx,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:38:55 2015 UTC,This is pretty interesting in terms of the way they use click through rate as part of the algorithm.  Adam Singer at Google tweeted that they don't use any analytics data when ranking sites too.

SEO,3cu6gx,jay76,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:02:46 2015 UTC,"Searchmetrics 2014 Ranking Factors study noted that Click-through rate was the biggest determining factor when it comes to rankings on Google. While this is not a metric that qualifies bounce rate, it is related. If people are clicking on your website link and finding the content on page to be bad, they will bounce. Surely Google would consider UX post CTR on a user's visit to play a role. Perhaps I assume too much?  If you want to lower your bounce rate, give users a reason to create a second hit/interaction on your website (a link to click, a video, etc.) Or you can manually lower the bounce rate by setting up a JavaScript timer to fire every 10 or seconds someone is on a page, or use Justin Cutroni's Scrolltracking code"
SEO,3cu6gx,Tuilere,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:06:47 2015 UTC,"The only way to measure bounce rate would be to tap your analytics data, wouldn't it?  They don't do that as far as I know."
SEO,3cu6gx,chadkimball,2,Sat Jul 11 04:46:51 2015 UTC,"Matt Cutts has confirmed that they don't track user GA.   However, they do track every click through Google, along with a lot of other user browsing info (AdSense basically runs on that stuff). That includes people clicking your search results, backing out, and clicking something else. I'm pretty sure I've read a confirmation from Google that they track those search bounces, but can't find where that was."
SEO,3cu6gx,chadkimball,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:37:05 2015 UTC,"Bounce rate is a bullshit metric, and situational at best.  I was involved with a website where we saw bounce rate go up very highly in a particular week of the year. It related to the kind of information we offered. Users looking for this information weren't going to ""engage"" or any such crap. They were going to come to this page, find delight in the information they craved, and not consume additional pages. So they technically ""bounced.""  But they were happy!   Now, sure, if you've got bounce issues that equal conversion path issues, you need to re-engineer something.  Specific percentage isn't something to obsess on.  As far as bounce-for-Google, it's really a matter of if someone clicks from an organic result and hits back quickly, it may hurt your ranking. It probably should hurt your ranking. Clearly, whatever someone searching that term is looking for isn't being delivered."
SEO,3cu6gx,chadkimball,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:35:56 2015 UTC,"I specifically just want to know about how bounce rate effects SERPs with Google backed up by quotes from Google or other prominent SEOs, research, case studies, or statistics.

SEO,3csy2g,MercenaryCarter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"It's accurate, it's from the source.   What is missing is context and understanding. This data is limited in many ways that aren't apparent.   For one, it's not every query or search.  The figures are an average of every sampled search. It's a broad average. Tip: Don't get caught up in the day to day numbers, look at the bigger picture. I. e. if you have 7 #1 results and the other 3 are served at #4, your average ranking will be 1.9. This doesn't mean you rank between 1st and 2nd, it's just an average.  If you have a high amount of cardinality it will begin to rate limit or merge data. This will affect the figures for some query / page level metrics.  If you have big data problems in Google Analytics, that ports over here as well (sampling and low confidence). You should already know what I am saying here if you deal with this issue.  Google rarely provides comprehensive data. Basically at some point you hit a process limit and the sampling / averaging begins. The bigger the data set, the more you have to really watch your sample sizes to know if what you are looking at is even trustworthy or accurate.  What GWT does do ... is give you a point of reference. It is good for opportunity assessment, tracking progress, and trending.  Google does this to limit the amount of processing so that their servers don't get overwhelmed. It's not nefarious or subversive."

SEO,3cquza,MercenaryCarter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, Google business page is complete. Getting links is quite difficult, but we're constantly working on them.   Some competitors have lower quality backlinks (links from comments on other blog etc), have non-responsive sites with no mobile version, yet they rank much higher (I don't get that).  And I know that they haven't touched their site in a year or so.   I'm beginning to worry that I'm overlooking something obvious on the site, or I'm doing something wrong."
SEO,3cquza,onemananswerfactory,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:01:15 2015 UTC,hence my question of what we're doing wrong.
SEO,3cquza,Tuilere,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:13:28 2015 UTC,"Most backlinks we get are links from publications: blogs / bridal magazines. Some from other vendors mentioning us on their blogs. And some from vendor directory type of sites.  That's pretty much it.  We've been trying to get more high-quality backlinks for months now, but we ran out of ideas quickly."
SEO,3cquza,Drew_Force,2,Fri Jul 10 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"Google My Business page up and running, verified and such? If not, get on that ASAP.  The links from bridal mags and vendors are the exact kind of links you want pointing to your website. Get more of those. See if one of the mags can do a feature article on you.  Plus, social media wise, find all the people who follow bridal stuff and get in front of them."
SEO,3cquza,Drew_Force,2,Fri Jul 10 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"You need text. Seriously, you cannot expect to rank without text."
SEO,3cquza,seasalty_,2,Fri Jul 10 03:37:37 2015 UTC,"This. Also be realistic that Photography is super competitive. Most of these guys are pretty savvy and even the basic guys will be doing a bit of SEO so it's going to take a long time before you start seeing results. Remember that spammy links DO get results, but you're always on borrowed time with that strategy and would highly recommend not getting involved if you care about your brand.  My advice is to continue with other Marketing/PR strategies and always keep the potential of a backlink in mind. Try getting in touch with journalists from your local/community newspaper and see if they want to do a story about wedding photographers and hopefully there is an online version with a link.  Basic rule: If you can click a Submit button then it's not always reliable (so many little and ""niche"" directories just drop off the face of the Earth) and definitely something your competitors can always duplicate."

SEO,3cquza,dickapicture,2,Fri Jul 17 12:44:57 2015 UTC,"It's already pointed out, but you need more text.  You want to rank with ""wedding photographers in CT"",""CT wedding photographers"", but I can't find this written anywhere on your website (besides the footer).  Google needs hints to know what your website is about. It doesn't understand images, and you need to give out written messages.  Here are some ideas to add relative text to your website, without text blogging.  Page title!  Top page text - Consider rewriting the text so that it includes the words/reated words you want to rank in.  You can maybe also add one of the reviews from your clients.  Our Team text- Explain your relation with wedding photography, or how you are based in CT.  Raves - Maybe add location of your clients or photo location? (seasalty_ ABC Venue, City, State)  And lastly, I know you said text blogging is not happening, but then the blog pages is such a waste..(to seo)   Look at your competitors. What are they doing that you aren't? You can't beat them if you are lacking in content compared to them.  You don't need to write a WALL of text. You guys have a lot of content already, so just writing down a small description of what kind of wedding it was goes a long way. (Who were these people? Was it color themed? Where it was located? What kind of photography is it?)   Other places you might have to look at:  Your page speed is kind of slow,  https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvophotographers.com%2F  and all your pages are skipping H2 tags :(  good luck!"

SEO,3cquza,HuskyPants,2,Thu Jul 16 13:33:17 2015 UTC,"You are going to have to include text on your blog. Its hard to rank for a keyword or term when they are only used a few times on your site. If you can't or won't blog, hire a local freelancer to do so. There are huge opportunities to blog about venues and each wedding. You want to become a resource for brides to be.  Network with your bride's makeup artists and hairstylists. Supply them with with images for their sites and ask for a backlinks to yours.  When I did a search for ""wedding photographers in CT"" I got a local 7 pack. We've found the easiest way to get to the front page of Google is via the local 7 pack. No one knows Google's algorithm but the local 7 pack seems to be based on reviews.  The number one site in the local 7 pack appears to only have 22 reviews, you have 27. The difference is that 8 of their reviews are coming from Google.  Follow up with a survey for every wedding that you shoot. Send another follow up email and ask everyone who has had a positive experience to leave a review. Include a link to your review page on these sites. You need to make it as easy as possible for clients to review your services.  You may also want to ask for more reviews on Google. The majority of your reviews are coming for a single source (theknot.com). Create accounts on other review sites and spread them out.  You may also want to work on your Google My Business page. With only 9 followers, Google isn't seeing your business as an authority. Cross post your Facebook content to you Google+ page.  You may also want to purchase a Universal Business or similar service. They start at only $79 a year."

Why I'm asking this question (I ask it to all my clients - local SEO and marketing consultant): I think you could generate more leads by focussing on other stuff (for example partnerships with flower shops).  On top of that I would like you to take a look at long tail vs short tail SEO. You could try to create some long tail landingpages and look where those get you.

Has the number of pages actually indexed in google drop?  If nothing has changed in your website's performance, you may just leave it as is, and work on existing problems? Although I understand it's a bit worrying.    There are already some useful tips commented, but adding more things to check out.  Have you checked all your pages that are (supposed to be) indexed?  Luckily your website doesn't have many pages like an e-commerce site, so you should look at every page.  Look at the pages and question the following:  Is the content sufficient to be indexed? (>Soft 404? Duplicate content? these are hard to get indexed)  Does the page give off any errors? (>500 errors, 404s?)  Does the page have link(s) from other pages? (>If not, bad crawlability?)  For the first two questions, you can also check at webmaster tools/search console via ""crawl errors"" to see any reported pages Google deemed bad.  If you checked everything, and every pages seems fine, maybe you can try the Fetch as Google tool and see if Google indexes your pages again.  http://searchengineland.com/how-to-use-fetch-as-googlebot-like-seo-samurai-214292"

For example, you have your website URL listed on the top of your Pinterest profile. That is a nofollow link. But I guarantee you the link still helps drive traffic. Maybe not as much weight in SEO terms, but it still beneficial to build up a backlink profile with a good ratio of dofollow and nofollow links.  Also Google takes CTR and relevancy into account. The more clicks and traffic you get, Google is probably going to deem your link/page as more relevant and try to push it up in SERPs.   Hopefully that helps."

SEO,3cm6d6,Tuilere,2,Thu Jul 9 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"The reality is we have no idea if/when/why nofollow links are counted or not. The pervading theory seems to be that search engine algorithms are extremely complicated and are unlikely to completely discard any information. So if a page is being linked, even if its a nofollow, its presence is probably at least somehow acknowledged.  I've never seen any kind of data to back any of this up, but it is a widely espoused idea in SEO discussions across the internet. But people have gone so far as to claim the nofollow tag is deprecated entirely and links are equal, while people on the other side of the fence say nofollow links are completely useless for SEO. Take it all with a grain of salt. Nobody actually knows except Google."

I found this way better than using redirects, as it's faster and smoother to the visitor. And you won't have to worry about duplicate content since you're using the canonical tag."

If you have preexisting work or a site already, they will make your NAP a nightmare for the skilled to clean up later."

If you don't know the details of what you've bought, it will be hard to know what to expect for your investment. Ask them for a demo and have a call to go through everything.  If you actually make use of their tools it can definitely be worth the price. Decent dashboard for getting info on performance and lead data.   In terms of lead gen, results vary. If you're a local services based business chances are you'll do well enough to make a return.  If the service doesn't meet your expectations, tell them. Usually service is good and they tend to do the right thing for the customer."
SEO,3cic6k,rversion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:03:43 2015 UTC,"Hi. I used to work for Yodle as a software engineer. I'm not sure exactly what product you've signed up for, but I worked directly on the product that had a price point around what you're describing.    Yodle's organic offering is essentially the following tradeoff.  The good parts:   Their SEO strategies are purely white hat, and they have gobs of data backing up their approach They do usually succeed at getting you highly ranked, and keeping you there You get a lot of visibility into Yodle's performance (they give you a dashboard which shows you which leads came from them, and, I think, how you rank in certain areas) They sell the entry-level organic offering, which is fully automated, pretty much at-cost, so you won't find a better price   The bad parts:   There will be markets where their strategy just fails to break you into top ranks. Because it's an automated solution, there's not much they can do to address it There's no great way to migrate off of Yodle's offering while keeping your ranking As others have mentioned, they do use tracking numbers/emails (which is how they can show you which leads came through them), so if you unsubscribe, those contacts (I think, though I could be wrong/outdated) become dead   If I had to generalize, I'd say that Yodle is a good solution if you're willing to let them handle the majority of your online presence in return for pretty-good-but-probably-not-outstanding results.     As for the ""is it a scam? is it not a scam?"" question: it's definitely a well-intentioned offering. The product you get is pretty much the same product they sell to companies like Miracle Ear (if you search for Miracle Ear, most of the results you'll get are Yodle pages, which you can confirm by doing a View Source on those pages and then searching for ""yodle"")."

Ultimately, I think it's a mix between playing to your strengths and learning things that will make the sum (you) greater than the parts (your individual skills).    Copywriting, Analytics, and light coding are the most important secondary skills for an SEO IMO.    Copywriting I feel is frequently overlooked, and is enormously important when it comes to anything content-creation and brand development.   Analytics and measurement is in-part a function of SEO itself, but learning where/how, automation & dashboard creation is an enormous time-saver when it comes to any client/company requests.  And of course you need to know your way around every [major] CMS.

SEO,3ci0o5,Miacaras,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:59:55 2015 UTC,"Make what you are doing relevant to the type of customer you want.  If the keywords you are targeting aren't working think outside the box. Find out what your customers are interested in and write about that in context with your service or product.  Its not just about a particular keyword but the entire sphere of influence. Expand yours to where your customers are and they will come.  Example (without any clue of what you are trying to drive traffic too) - say you are trying to drive traffic to a website for lets say commercial shelving or racking. (This is probablly a large market but bear with me) If you are targetting a keyword along the lines of ""standardized steel shelving"" odds are you aren't getting much traction with a category or product page. But if you take that same keyword and write a ""how to outfit your store with shelving and displays"" and in that article plug the product, you will reach your demographic and possibly extend beyond your target market. You could also write something along the lines of making secision about which type of shelving.  I hope you see where I am going with this. Offer information at no charge and establish yourself as knowledgeable in your feild. Keywords wont matter so much as overall intent because you are drawing in crowds with information they need but may not quite understand.  This is bases for content marketing.

I would use CSS to reposition the breadcrumbs.  Remember to not use Header elements to style and make font bigger. the Header tags should be used to describe the page. Breadcrumbs typically describe the site structure, not the content structure, so i wouldn't put an h2 around them. I would use CSS to style them larger or whatever you want."

SEO,3cekiv,WgtnToAkl,3,Tue Jul 7 08:22:36 2015 UTC,"There is not one but many important factors that can affect the amount of traffic your website is getting. It all depends on the niche. If your website is getting 1k page view a week, this means you atleast know something about how to get a website started. 1k visitors is actually more than what majority of websites on the internet receive.  There are many ways you can improve the traffic to your website. But, whichever method you use, you must know that CONTENT is the most important factor when it comes to Internet marketing. If you can create content that is informative and engaging to your target audience, your website will attract more visitors.  Benefits of creating good content is that it helps you improve your ranking on Search engines like Google, yahoo, and bing, without doing much link building and other activities.    - TIPS:   Make your website more informative and engaging with Good content.  Start social media campaign. - Find your audience in social media and talk to them. share your website with them. Find other good websites related to your niche and engage with them, share your content with them in your engagement. If they find that your content is useful, they will link back to your website.  Join communities on Social media websites like Facebook, Google Plus, Pinterest. Share your content wth them. If they like your content they will share it on their social media account and on their website to, linking back to your website.  If you find anyone with your website content like pictures, or articles on their website without a citation, send them a message and ask them to site your website as the original content creator. Don't let people use your content without linking back to your website.  Create differnt type of multimedia content like- Infographics, videos, Pictures, audio files, slides related to your website and share them in the top media sharing website.  If anyone respond to your media or content, engage with them. Answer their questions prompltly, reply to their comments, or reviews.  Use newsletter sign up forms on your website. Its very important, If people find your content good, they will sign up for newsletter and then you can send them new updates via email. Don't spam.   FINAL WORDS:  -As a digital marketer, I consider Informative, engaging and creative content as the most important factor to increase a websites traffic. It works fo all niches. Without good content your website cannot rank on Search engines, cannot get targetted visitors, cannot keep the visitors on your website, and cannot make any sale or click, etc. Every top website in the world is on top because of the content they provide to their visitors. Content is the King.

You can start by identifying your audience and research what do they want (what are they searching for). Your website should have enough content to answer the questions for those people, fulfill demands, you name it. You will truly be successful (if this is what you want) when you will become an authority in your niche.   Of course, my whole answer is useless if you have a different website model, but even so, attach a blog to your website, think long tail. If you write it, they will come. For you this should be the starting point. After that you only have to research more, read, learn and apply."

SEO,3ca7iw,loudtyper,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"Let's throw another layer on here - because this is fairly common.  Forced redirects based on localization.    I'm a user in the US; so I see the /us-en/ (as an example) version of your site.   Would the bot see the redirect to /us-en/ or see the complete site?  And if the bot sees the whole site, would that be based on user agent detection (ie, whitelisted bots?)   I see a lot of sites screwing this up - redirecting the bot with a 302, which seems counterintuitive to me."
SEO,3ca7iw,waldito,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:17:49 2015 UTC,"When you say 'Forced redirects based on localization' are you meaning a client-browser-based-language-settings redirect? Or are we talking about a geoip operation? 'I'm a user in the US' hints me is the second case, right?  Not sure about GeoIp, but as long as your language head tags and canonical urls are well declared, got a handsome smap.xml, and your site is javascript-free 'crawlable' between languages, you can perfectly run a client-browser-based-language-settings redirect. The bot will likely land in your catch-all-URL-home-in-case-you-don't-have-language-settings page, and will start indexing happily all URLs. the bot being client-browser-based-language-settings or not, should not matter.  I'm not 100% sure about this, but it would be my approach. I am not making serious amounts of money with my SEO skills nor I am a pro on IT. take my opinion with a grain of salt."

If the site is de indexed, then you'd have to assume it would not appear in the SERPS at all for any keyword.  It's a tough one. As freshness is also a ranking factor, perhaps early on your page rose to #30 for a brief period before completely sliding out of the top 300?

If I pick the appropriate landing page to send this visitor to, I'd have a better shot at getting them to buy my watches."

SEO,3c7y3w,wwhacked,2,Mon Jul 6 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"Probably the most obvious example would be when you're buying targeted traffic to an offer.  Suppose you have an e-commerce consumer electronics store and you're buying keywords on Google to display ads for ""Hard plastic mouse mats.""  If you link those ads to your homepage, the visitor won't know where to find the offer that actually matches what he was looking for. He'll see a bunch of stuff he just doesn't care about. That's going to cost you a lot of money for very little results.  The more targeted the traffic and offer, the more targeted the page has to be. That's why landing pages usually have only one call to action, and only one possible action (buying an item, filling in a lead generation form, etc.)."

SEO,3c7mwz,panache123,2,Sun Jul 5 23:37:31 2015 UTC,"That depends on whether 'best science gifts' is a better term than 'geek gifts' or any other possible combinations that could include 'geek'. Personally, I'd omit 'best' from an SEO perspective, however, the ""The Science and geek..."" doesn't make sense.   A blog has many purposes. Creating good content gives you better leverage for blog outreach and organic link building. It also helps Google connect the dots surrounding what your site is about and contributes to what keywords it should appear for (in short). Ideally, you should have a blog strategy. That means once you make a blog post, there are various avenues you should post the blog to drive traffic. General consensus is anything automated probably isn't good for SEO."

SEO,3c7t1t,msaoms,2,Mon Jul 6 01:27:36 2015 UTC,"Don't take on seo clientèle if there in the same competition. Your average client might not understand why it's unethical,  although if your doing your seo properly, you can quickly identify why its a conflict of interest. If there in two seperate markets, go for it!  With this said, I must identify that an Italian deli would be in the same market as a steakhouse.  Although there technically two different types of services, your average bear will ask the search engine ""name of city"" + ""restaurant""... Or something similar."
SEO,3c7t1t,springscript,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"This one is difficult, you want to make sure they understand that it's impossible for anyone to guarantee any SEO.  You should look into some of their competitors and see what SEO work they have done.  From there, you're able to get an idea of how competitive everything will be and give them a more realistic idea of what they are looking at.   Pricing is difficult too.  You can offer them different ""packages"" and tell them that the more they're willing to invest, the more you have to work with and the better they'll do.  I'm not great at this, I'm currently doing SEO for a doctors office and charged way less than what any SEO company would charge, but figured the experience is worth more than the money when you're starting out.  After you get some success, you can start showing clients and pricing becomes easier.  Realistically I took the job because lately I have had a solid amount of SEO success and have never tried out local SEO.  I told him it was new to me and I was interested, I explained to him how much SEO companies would charge for the type of stuff I was going to do for him, and I told him I would do my best but as with any SEO work, you can never guarantee results.  I also frequently try and explain to him how SEO works, and I make sure that anything I implement for him (eg Google Analytics), he will have the information to login and it is for him to keep.  Some SEO companies are douchebags about this stuff and once a client drops them, they keep everything and basically lock them out of it.  I figure if I have reasonable prices, and I'm getting results, there's no reason for him to drop me for another SEO company.  And if he does decide to do that, that's fine, because I know no other company is willing to put in the same amount of time and effort that I do at the prices I charge. I would suggest not working with competitors.  Typically when you do SEO, you want to get them in a retainer which normally is a monthly fee where you do X amount of work to keep their business doing well for SEO.  If you do the SEO for one company, and they drop you, then doing SEO for a company who's ""competition"" is fair game in my opinion.  If you do decide to do SEO for two competitors, you have to let them both know this as it's a conflict of interest.  Depending on how great you are at SEO, you could possibly do a bidding war between the two, but typically you should stay with the first company that hired you."
SEO,3c7t1t,psychyness,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:34:23 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for retainer options, some things I've offered were: local directory additions, blog content, social media posts, backlinks from various sites.    Pretty much anything you can think of that you would normally do on a website to help keep up with SEO.  I also find that after the initial onsite SEO is done and looking good, the retainer aspect is easier to keep up with and help keep your client happy.  Edit: Also, if you happen to have other ideas on how to help make a solid retainer feel free to post them! I'm always looking for ways to help increase my partnerships."

SEO,3c832u,stjulians,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:00:47 2015 UTC,"I have done and do work like this for local companies in my region. But as the comments are mostly saying, for a tough keyword, the SEO would be mad to take your terms.   To be honest, if the keyword really is tough, they will need budget to spend to create content, buy links, etc, so they would be out both time and money if you do not pay.   The only people that would be willing to look at this would be people with their own (very powerful) private blog network. This way, they could do link building for cheap, using their existing resources and then if you do not pay, they can remove the links and sooner or later your rankings will drop. As a client, this can be good if your budget really is limited, but it is not an ideal way to operate, especially if you are a brand with a well known reputation.   However, typically non-SEO people underestimate the effort or resources needed to rank for tough phrases. I can remember about 8 months ago being asked by a prospect to rank them for ""belts"" and ""chains"". You know, ""nothing difficult"". I quoted them 10k euros p/m for 2 years with no guarantee of rankings attached. They thought I was crazy, until I explained the level of competition. Then they got serious and specific about the phrases they were really interested in. It is funny how people often only really try and think when someone quotes them a quarter mill for the work..."

SEO,3bv96g,onemananswerfactory,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"I like the thinking here, but you will get the most out of your efforts if you just built pages on your site that give information about the different niches and aspects about your products.  You separate site value over all of your different subdomains, it is better to build out pages on your main domain and consolidate the power to one domain.   Make sure that one you do create a new page for a niche, or subdomain if you go that route, that the niche deserves its own content and that content is unique and informative.  You don't want to build doorway pages, which Google has recently come down on.  Overall, my advice is to build unique pages under one domain and not over many subdomains."

It doesn't have to compete for length, in fact, feel free to reference out the Denver page if you don't want to dup content.   I would focus on getting some outside links from the Boise area as well as creating Boise-specific blog posts. Make sure you're set up for Google Places and that the Yelp reviews are awesome as well, all of that can really help.

As far as I can tell analytics will only give me the gclid parameter.   Also they have a 'web guy' so I don't have access to the server unless it's a change I can make on the volusion platform (which I don't think it is because the redirect is set up because of their old site.)  So do I use the www.example.com {lpurl}&gclid  Like that? or  Google's example is: example.com{lpurl}&kwid={_kwid}&ad={creative}&utm_source=google  but I don't understand how gclid fits into that.

SEO,3bpsim,kassanu,3,Wed Jul 1 04:19:38 2015 UTC,"Before making any changes, think about your customer before SEO. Maybe even ask some customers what they think. You don't want to do it because you might get some more traffic, but find your customers hate the new layout and don't use you because of it."
SEO,3bpsim,TechCress,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:20:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but here are my thoughts...    The new URL structure sounds promising; however, as you mentioned, content is going to be an important factor. If the plan is to simply clone the pages and just change the SKU on each page, that is not a good idea. A better idea would be to create a generic product page with limited content, and then personalize each page to fit the SKU. Essentially you want to go for something like 20% duplicated content and 80% unique for that product. Along with this you should ideally have a sidebar menu with the corresponding link structure so people can easily parse through the products as they wish, but that's obvious. Also, make sure to update your sitemap to clarify the site structure (google loves sitemaps). Alternatively, you could use both structures simultaneously: have one generic product page that gives all the content about the product line and specific pages for each SKU, where each specific page has only unique content.  The benefit of having the new URL structure is that google can provide more relevant results for a given search (e.g. if customer searches category + product line + SKU, the best result for that search will be a unique page).    If the products are fundamentally very similar (for example, same product just different colors), then this new model won't work well because the duplicated content will possibly hurt you more than any benefit of targeted SKU pages.     So essentially what I am saying is that if you can make the pages different enough, then go for it -- if not, don't dupe the pages just for the hell of it."
SEO,3bpsim,joe-murray,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:00:32 2015 UTC,"While having a goal of more unique visitors from search engines is a good goal, the way you're going about it is problematic.   It sounds like you're going to take page a, duplicate page a and call it page b, then change a few values on page b.  In other words you're going to be creating a lot of new pages, without actually adding new/unique content. You can probably get a way with this at a small scale depending on your domain authority/popularity/trust, etc.   At the end of the day everything we do is risk versus reward, and you're probably more on the risk side of the spectrum here.  What I would do is take my current product line pages and make them more like category pages. Category pages typically have summarized/shortened product information, then you typically have product pages, that list all the data for that specific product. You'd effectively be moving most of your product line content from the product line page to the sku pages. This solves your per-sku pages goal, while improving usability by making the product lines categories and the skus products. I would also look to add more information to the sku pages.   At the end of the day your categories and product lines allow visitors to find your product pages. By wanting to add proper product pages (SKUs), you need the product line pages to act more like a category page than a grouped product page. Without even taking search engines into account this is sound logic."
SEO,3bpsim,robotoverlord,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:01:45 2015 UTC,Keep your current site/structure intact. Just add links from your SKU listing page to the individual SKU page. Then nothing  changes for existing customers plus you get the extra Google juice
SEO,3bpsim,physicist100,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how big your site is and how many product pages you have, but if it were me, I wouldn't change your URL structure.   I'd argue that your current URL structure is ideal because there's A LOT of valuable, unique and practical content on your <product line> pages since it covers each SKU under it. Making each SKU page contain this exact same information is gonna dilute it too much. You might even end up losing major traffic if Google decides all your product pages are basically duplicates of each other.  Again, this is just based on the limited information you gave. You can test it out on just a few product lines and see what happens."
SEO,3bpsim,ChapterJason,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:13:16 2015 UTC,I would keep the structure the way it is and just be sure to add all the skus to the current pages in the content and image alt tags. Having 20 very similar pages with different skus will cause duplicate content issues and all those pages will be fighting against each other in the serps for the head terms
SEO,3bpsim,Bogie_Baby,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:41:46 2015 UTC,"My first question would be:  Are there people searching for SKU #'s?  You can check the google keyword tool to find out.  Next:  Are your page optimized for the SKU #'s (title tags, h1s, body, etc?).  What are your rankings for those SKUs?  With a big URL change, there is a lot of risk to losing rankings and traffic for that page.  Its a big undertaking.  If it is going to result in 90% duplicate content, then its definitely not worth it.  Remove one of the directories so that there will just be 1 unique page of content for every product.  You could add canonical tags to the pages, but its just best to have 1 version of the page with all the info and not create multiple different URLs to have a keyword in the URL string.  Google also decreased the keyword power in the URL with their PMD update a couple years back."
SEO,3bpsim,crumbly8,0,Wed Jul 1 18:45:11 2015 UTC,if the SKU is different for each products then you can go with new URL structure. the URL should not be same and content also should be unique. If you are planning to move to new structure then make sure redirect your old url properly.
SEO,3bpsim,sameer-25,0,Wed Jul 1 05:15:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah. You're right. But give it a test for 2-3 months. On-page stuff is very reversible so give it a go and be all ""I told you so"" if you drop. If it works, awesome.   Amazon and most ecommerce sites have insane internal duplicate and thin content so maybe ecommerce internal dupes are dealt with... differently. Or maybe they just have insane authority and are bullet proof.  At least ensure your breadcrumbs are feeding back to the product line page. Google sometimes won't index high dupe pages or will index high dupe as being a different URL. i.e. some sort of mechanism to make the pages a bit more unique will be good - for example product + SKU in page title and main heading."

Then spend twice as long (during those remaining 3 - 4 weeks in the cycle) getting the word out about the article. Email it to your segmented lists (you do segment right? ... right?), syndicate it to your outreach lists (or build that list), get it on LinkedIn or in front of your audience AND more importantly, in front of subject matter experts that will share your content (because it is high quality!).  Combine that with local citations, and refining your local outreach via PR and link building. Leverage your business relationships. Invest in conversion rate optimization.

People coming to your site is good, but them leaving right away is not good.  I'd rather have less people come and stay than more people come and go.    Remove them.  It's not relevant.

On the other hand, if these are embarrassing, they could be hurting your brand as posts are supposed to give your site and company and voice and personality.

You need a bare minimum of a few hundred words on a page, in paragraph format, in order to even hope to rank for anything.  Adding ~500 unique words to 30,000 different pages seems pretty impossible though, and doing it via computer-generated text probably won't produce great results.

The only catch is the context of the content that will be added. I'm thinking product descriptions that I can manually write. I'm not sure how helpful that would be though. EDIT: also the descriptions will be repeated throughout the site if I were to do this. Any chance of a hit in rankings with duplicate but original content throughout the site?  Is there any downside to attempting to rank the homepage with multiple profitable keywords?"
SEO,3bo6zu,NakedAndBehindYou,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"In order to rank a page well it needs to have unique content on it, not content that is also published on a bunch of other pages, which is what will happen if you write content for 40,000 pages off of a database of 250 pages of text. Having the same lines of text appear on multiple pages of your site is Google's definition of ""duplicate content"" and those pages will not rank well if at all.  Publishing 40,000 pages of unique content, meaning content that appears on no other page and no other website, is basically impossible unless your budget is in the $200K+ range solely for content creation.  I suggest that instead of trying to make individual product pages rank well, you just target a few big keywords that will attract buyers of your products, and create new pages on your site that are 100% dedicated to ranking for those few keywords. Then promote the hell out of those pages to create backlinks, and hope the SEO organic traffic actually ends up buying your products."

SEO,3bo6zu,AF4Q,2,Tue Jun 30 21:51:23 2015 UTC,"I ran your website through an SEO intelligence tool called CanIRank? that I've worked with. I am not sure what your target keyword is/would be but I put in “laptop reviews” and “laptop ranking since those were the first phrases that came to mind when I visited your site. The following is what I got off the report for your site and that keyword phrase.... ""A Ranking Probability score of 50% means that this keyword is just too competitive for your website right now. Your best bet would be to find a less competitive keyword, or spend some time completing Action Recommendations to improve your website until you can tackle keywords like this. You'll especially need to focus on improving your Page Ext Relevancy, Website Ext Relevancy, Page Strength, and Website Strength. The traffic from a #1 ranking for this keyword is worth an estimated $220/ year, so it's worth putting a little work into SEO.""  Your two main competitors right now are www.techiesense.com/best-laptop-brands/ and https://blog.laptopmag.com/laptop-brand-ratings . So head over to those sites out and see what their doing; see if there is anything you could take away from what their doing to add onto your site.  Just a few of the actions that are recommended for you are in your site's report: - ""Fewer websites consider your site to be a relevant resource for this keyword."" - ""Your page needs more inbound links from other sites.""  There's a lot more recommendations like these as well as how to fix them on the report but I don't want to bombard this post. Any questions, feel free to shoot me a PM."

SEO,3blx13,ChapterJason,5,Tue Jun 30 20:36:39 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, Wifom. Your situation isn't that dire if your boss is pushing you to learn about SEO knowing that you're starting from scratch.  That means you have  A LOT of room to move around. I was in the same place a year ago (still kinda am now, but not so much anymore) and I want to help you, but SEO and content marketing are two really really massive things.   I suggest reading those articles you've saved first then speaking with your boss about setting some realistic goals for the first 3 months then breaking that down further, then asking back here when you encounter trouble. This place is filled with experts, but you have to do your homework first.  Let's say for example that you want to increase raw traffic by 10%. You have to spread that out on how you want to do it (do an audit first because simple on page cleaning up has a big impact by itself). One way is to get links so set a target to get 20 links during that time. Then break that down again, look for 5 relevant directories + guest blog for 5 websites + promote 10 posts from your own website. Then break those up again since those all have different strategies. You might even want to dedicate a month each for them.  Once you've hit that, you can move onto the next goal which is to increase sales by 10%. You already have the traffic, now you have to figure out how to convince them to actually buy (or sign up, or download an ebook etc.).  In summary, SEO is too broad for a beginner to ask for tips to ""blast you off the ground"". Do your homework, apply them on your website, then come back to us.   Goodluck dude/girl! Excited to hear about your progress."

I'll tell you one thing, people won't really react how you think they're going to all the time. You can make the most awesome post ever and be dismayed at the lack of engagement. Then you'll make a shitty post that you hardly put any effort in to and it'll be one of your most successful. Find out why and try to measure it as much as you can. On top of the measuring is the creative side where you're trying to find out what makes your market tick.    If you're in a rush for design, use canva.com.   Seo... Start with the basics as that will take you long enough anyway. Those basics are making sure the structure and content of your site is user friendly, seeing what your competitors are doing and copying the good points, look at the way people are behaving on your site at the moment. You can do that with Google analytics of course.  Edit: There isn't really a ""blast off the ground"" technique, try not to think about that or expect it. Slow and steady is the way that almost all business grow at first. Try to make your boss understand this so there's no unrealistic expectations. Apply this thought x 10 for seo.  Read good basic seo practices and then clean up the site while that stuff is still fresh in your mind. Read as much as you can so you don't have to go back and clean up later. Once it starts sounding like a broken record and people are saying the same stuff over and over again in those beginner guides, you can probably then start fixing up the site!"

You can check how well you are targeting keywords on each page with Moz's grader.  Any SEO agency worth the money would achieve this by creating quality content on your behalf that will attract said links and citations. Being in the top 10 is good, but top 3 is where the majority of organic traffic goes.  Content comes in all shapes and sizes depending on your product/industry.  It could be a downloadable ebook, an online quiz, an interactive game, or something entirely different.

An old domain with jackshit for content or linking is no better than a new domain with jackshit for content or linking. Age correlates to those factors, but isn't causation.  When a company has multiple web presences that all interlink, the likelihood is that those links don't count for much. The relationship is known and apparent. It's the equivalent of a fap. You're touching yourself. The link algorithm is really about other people touching you.  In general, if the older domain has no real domain authority or links, I'd put the blog on a subdirectory, redirect anything worthwhile, and concentrate on a single domain in this instance. There are plenty of use cases for multiple domains and niche sites, but the interlinking tends to be a minor benefit at best."

The reason I'm asking is because often it's the approach that gets ignored. You might think it was a reasonable offer, but when there are 2 parties trying to maximize value, initial lowball offers, sob stories, and poor grammar will often go without reply because many sellers feel they aren't going to get what they want.  Now, if you wrote asking his price and saying you were interested and he didn't respond, you might need to try again because there's no reason he shouldn't at least entertain.   Again, it's all in the approach in domain name acquisition.   If you did what you could and it looked legit, and you try again with no response, then it's time to look in another direction."

I'd focus more on one domain to maximize effort.   also can the domains point into different pages on the site or only the main page?

SEO,3bhbqa,syncdev,2,Mon Jun 29 08:57:54 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer.  Really, it's not the domain, it's what you do with it. You can rank on WordPress.com, or Blogger, or Tumblr just fine. But they'll look crappy on a t-shirt, sound bad in a radio ad, etc.   In the long term, you need to generate traffic from more than one source. SEO is an excellent lead generation stream, but businesses that are wholly dependent on SEO can get fucked overnight in algorithm updates even if they're doing everything ""right"". Building a brand and a multi-channel strategy requires a domain."
SEO,3bhbqa,Tuilere,2,Mon Jun 29 12:50:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, it can, but it depends.  If you purchase a domain that hasn't dropped (i.e. expired) directly from a person that has done some work to it (content, links, .etc) and the topic doesn't change - it's a gold mine.   I've seen this happen on a large scale time and again. Company A has an awesome domain with great organic traffic and Company B wants it.   Now, you're probably wondering if just buying a domain, like an exact match domain (EMD) is going to help...probably not. A new domain won't do much for you, but don't worry too much, it's about building a brand for the long haul anyway, right?   My advice would be to pick something local and memorable. Make sure it's listed in Google Places for local SERP's and write some relevant content on a regular basis.   For a bigger push with organic, using a tool like Spyfu or iSpionage to see what your competitors are doing (both paid and organic) is a great way to not only see the keywords they use, but the keywords that work!   Combine those strategies, and some hard work getting your name out on social networks and you should be doing well in no time."

More than likely that will be taken, but guess what... you could do ""mycity-computer-repair.com"". Google doesn't care one bit about those dashes and treats that domain exactly the same as far as keywords.   One more reason for buying a domain. They're cheap. You can find one on godaddy for less than $2 for the first year if you search for a promo code.

I'd write an ambitious proposal, since the nature of what he's doing (going from 1 location to 10) is quite ambitious. He's all-in so he's probably more likely to do business with someone who's willing to go all-in to make it work. Remember, it takes a lot of capital to do an expansion like that. Determine the worth of your work. It's a huge project and if he stands to make a lot of money off of what you're doing then so should you.   In terms of structuring the way you charge him, think about it like this. You have 1 brand who has multiple branches (like schema: itemtype=""Organization"" and then the itemtype=""branchOf""). You should include not just SEO for each location, but SEO for the brand a whole. And if you have the manpower to do so, don't use a local citation service. You lose money on work you could be doing, and you can create better local citations if you do it yourself vs. using a service."

(regardless of whether they actually do it or not would be nice to know what options there are to request).  I've looked at competition - a few quality backlinks should actually make a major difference...but not if google doesn't recognise them!

On sites you don't control, you can't do much to make Google crawl them. However, here's the thing: if Google isn't reaching the page with your link on it, the link isn't a very good link. Sites/pages with high value are crawled frequently. You can see this just by looking at how quickly changes to many Wiki articles hit the cache."

Those are the ones that they're hoping to rank for[outside of their own branded terms].   Edit: I see you put SEM & SEO, thought this was /r/ppc.  Within our campaigns->ad-groups->keywords we'll actually break them out into different match types as well when it comes to PPC/SEM.  You'll have keywords that are Exact, Phrase, and Exact Match; On the surface they'll appear the same, but what triggers each will be determined by match type as well as a ton of other different factors.    These range from Geographical Targeting, Match Type, Negative Keywords included, and any number of other targeting criteria.  At the root though, it's the keywords themselves that we're optimizing for both from a SEM standpoint, and a SEO standpoint thematically.  Organic (SEO) has less immediate control over appearance for the keywords, so optimization tends to skew more towards themes rather than individual keywords, but given the search volume difference from one variation to another it's equally important, just more variable."

All sorts of stuff.  It's nice to have pages on social, but you build on ""land"" you own. This does not have to be pricey. A WordPress site with a domain can be $25/year.

By that I mean Menu, Hours, and anything that a normal human would want to find about a restaurant they're visiting.    If they'd like to potential show up for whatever type of food they are, I would really suggest you recommend the few dollars it will cost to buy and host a site.  For ~$20 they can buy their own site and hosting, which you can build out to give them the chance to rank for their category.    Also this is easy ranking but I'm embarrassed to say I'm not entirely sure if you can claim the Google MyBusiness listing without a site.  I want to say I've been to places where they only listed the menu via www.allmenu.com or similar but I'm not sure.  If possible, you'll want to claim this listing (https://support.google.com/business/answer/2911778?hl=en)  Being in a mall, foot traffic is obviously the overwhelming majority of volume, but at least being visible for people looking for them by name is important, and can be done free or at a very low cost."

SEO,3b4ic9,bomaine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a freelance SEO and I have never used a contract. There are a couple of reasons behind this: - I want to make it as pain free as possible to get clients started - I use a very long email where I spell out the expectations etc - I live on a small-ish island where prices are pretty low and I just don't see it as feasable to enforce a contract for a couple of thousand - The legal system here takes forever, so if I wanted to enforce a contract, the process would take me 3-5 years  This has all helped me to learn a few things about doing business as a freelance. The trustworthy clients are trustworthy from day 1. The untrustworthy clients are untrustworthy from day 1. Therefore, I spend quite a lot of time with them at the start, mainly to figure out whether I think they will be trustworthy or not, but also to help explain what will be happening. The more time you spend with someone, the more trustworthy and honest they will be with you.   At first, this was a very painful learning experience, but now I am mostly correct in my judgement calls. The people I think are going to be good clients, I make good offers to to get them to sign up. The people I think will be bad clients, I either make very expensive offers to (just in case they say yes, I expect to be paid well) or I don't make an offer at all.
