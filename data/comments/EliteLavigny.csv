It's really sad to see how many people still think that FDev ""bailed out"" Arissa from turmoil and don't actually understand how the game is supposed to work.  It's nice that they gave us the formula. I don't like that they're still so set on capping large factions. Eventually, there will be a solid wall that factions will not be allowed to surpass. That seems like a huge waste of potential. The galaxy is huge, let factions be huge, too!"
EliteLavigny,3dytla,NEM3S1S,3,Mon Jul 20 17:34:11 2015 UTC,Problem is that populated space is quite limited. If we had a mechanic to terraform planets and build stations it would be a huge game changer.

EliteLavigny,3dytla,NEM3S1S,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"It should be a part of PowerPlay. You expand into a system and your faction starts settling. The income from the uninhabited system starts very low, and increases over time as more people start settling.  That would actually be a fantastic mechanic. Get rid of overhead completely and tie income to the system population. Distant systems would be hard to hold onto because you'd be pouring CC into populating those systems, until they eventually start giving CC back. Then, another faction could swoop in and reap your benefits, turning the system to their side. It would still allow for large factions to run into a wall when expanding, but still be able to break through it, and add another layer of depth to faction politics. Plus, they could get rid of that frankly really stupid overhead formula.  Damn. That actually sounds really good. Hire me, FDev."
EliteLavigny,3dytla,aspiringexpatriate,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"If you notice, Sandro recently said that they don't want Exploited System Income to change massively week to week.   The thing about Powerplay activties is that they're pretty clear in terms of success, failure and effect. The idea that a power's CC income could, in addition, fluctuate based on effects that were completely outside of their knowledge frightens me.   I guess that doesn't forbid a highly publicised community goal in order to do it, though.   It's really sad to see how many people still think that FDev ""bailed out"" Arissa from turmoil and don't actually understand how the game is supposed to work.   But they did bail us out. Granted, they bailed us out of their oddly conceived formula, but it was still a bail out. The apparent goal now is to make it difficult for a mid-sized Power to maintain itself and continue expanding. Larger Powers will contract if faced with enough undermining, but have the capability to maintain themselves and recover from Turmoil. So, if ALD started from Cycle 1 with this formula, Cycles 2-4 would have been much more limited than they were. I believe we were expanding 10 systems a Cycle, which was insane.  EDIT: Added quote.  And it frightens me too, which is why I hope they enact it before 1.4 drops."
EliteLavigny,3dytla,NEM3S1S,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"When I think of a bailout, I think of Obama's bank bailout. The banks did really shady and risky things, paid the price, but were bailed out anyway. Arissa did nothing wrong. We just played the game too well and hit their brick wall.  The problem is overhead. It's a stupid system. Even if a power were to grab only the highest-value systems, the overhead system ensures that the cost of planets will go up pretty much infinitely. There is a hard cap on the size of powers, even if FDev wants to dance around it and say there's not.  Something FDev didn't consider is that if a mechanic exists in an MMO game (which is what the community is seeing their game as, even if they don't), the players can and will exploit it. They allowed for 10 expansions, and we did 10 expansions. They never said we'd hit a wall, only a steep climb. Yet we did hit a wall, and they realized it, and they fixed it.  Overhead is just such a stupid idea that it hurts my brain trying to figure out why they thought it would work."
EliteLavigny,3dytla,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:26 2015 UTC,"New Overhead calculations. Check it out.  Now, it appears FDev's goal is to stall out rampant expansion from 28-38 systems, but leave expansion fairly breezy above and below those marks.  For Powers as large as ours, it makes Fortification deathly important, which it should be."
EliteLavigny,3dytla,CMDRJohnCasey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:27 2015 UTC,"Overhead is not an absurd thing, we've seen thin supply lines and deep penetration in enemy territories without consolidation being responsable of a certain number of defeats in history: Russia (for Hitler and Napoleon), Saratoga, Market Garden...  Arissa did something wrong: Pacienses, it was a tactical victory but a strategical defeat. Instead of putting pressure on Hudson, the pressure is constantly on Pacienses, which is an easy target due to its proximity to the federal border. Had you expanded in a similar valued system far from the border, you would have the possibility to completely fortify it and spare the upkeep cost.  Anyway, I agree that you hit the wall too fast and that's FD fault to not foresee that. It makes more sense stopping expansions once a power hits turmoil than stopping just preparations. It was this (keeping 10 expansions when the power was already in turmoil) and not upkeep that created the abnormal situation. But as you said blame's on the game mechanics, not players."
EliteLavigny,3dytla,ImperiusII,2,Mon Jul 20 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Pancienses is the only system to blame it in fact it served as intended from the start. Even inspired some powers to copycat and overdue it drastically.  It's the other systems that poped up next to it that's the problem,  unreachable player base and what not.   Anyway plans are in place for a replacement system when the time is right,  the legions not going to shoot ald in the foot over a system we're going to be the 1st waving goodbye."
EliteLavigny,3dytla,NEM3S1S,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"It's not the fact that more distant systems are harder to upkeep that I have a problem with. That makes sense. It's the ridiculous way that they're doing it. If there's one thing I've come to fear in my years of programming (about 8 now), it's exponents. The fact that there's a cube in the overhead equation means that every expansion is going to make holding onto everything, well, exponentially more difficult. That's just silly.  Penetration into enemy territory is obviously going to be difficult, but that's accounted for by systems that could be exploited by both being exploited by neither. That makes the system worth very little, which in turn makes it easier to take, yada yada yada.  The problem is that Overhead places a solid granite sphere, an Iron Curtain, if you will, around every power. No power will ever, EVER, be able to expand outside of that sphere. If you get only the most optimal systems, eventually, Overhead is going to catch up, that's how the formula works.  When I first heard about PowerPlay, I was looking forward to factions expanding greatly, with one or two dominant factions (Hudson and Arissa were my picks) controlling massive swaths of territory spanning thousands of systems. It would make for some pretty epic stories and battles. Instead, PowerPlay is confined to a reasonably small space, and will never ever expand beyond that space.  Then there's also the massive oversight in the placement of powers. Literally the only way for Aisling to reasonably expand is through Cartoi. That system was so close to being denied week 1. Had Arissa controlled it, Aisling would have choked and died within weeks, because literally every other expansion leads to basically dead space. Arissa, on the other hand, had proverbial rich soil for hundreds of light-years, that Aisling could only access through Cartoi, and which would have eventually led to war, and still might, if people keep playing. The question I have to ask though is: Why?  I know I'm beating a dead horse, and everyone else is starting to agree, that PowerPlay is extremely far from being ready."

I assume the Federation and Hudson was ignored because why should we stop him running into the brick wall.  With the brick wall removed, it might be advantageous for us to put focus back on the Feds.  Basically, stop them from expanding into +75 cc systems as well as undermining?  The new formula also makes undermining Archon a lot harder and will not stop him expanding.  His expansion attempts can still be stopped though if they encroach on Empire space of course...

Their overhead will be raised significantly. See this data.  Once Operation Davy Jones is concluded you can bet we will be hitting the Feds hard. Don't get me wrong, several of our members still actively fight in Fed space. That said, it was a strategic risk to allow Hudson and Winters some breathing room. Allowing them to expand increases their overhead, hopefully making our job easier. We shall see how things end up. To be sure though, the Empire, Alliance, and Federation will always exist.

EliteLavigny,3dwwnl,NEM3S1S,0,Mon Jul 20 18:58:35 2015 UTC,"But that's all I see, small tweaks. The statement about treating Open and Solo as equal speaks volumes. Think about this:   They're focusing on XBone deveopment They're focusing on CQC They view Open and Solo as equal   To me, focusing on new systems, when the existing ones are still pretty much in beta, shows that they care more about cranking content to generate hype, and therefore sales, than making sure that the existing game is full and complete. A small change here and there just doesn't cut it.  But like I've said before, maybe they are working on an overhaul, and they want to surprise us with it. I think that's really stupid, considering how many people are leaving the game because of their lack of significant response, but it's a possibility.  The core issue, I think, lies in FDev's desire to make the game they want to play. That's fine and dandy, but not something I'm interested in. If this were a subscription-based game, they'd be losing me. Unfortunately, it's not, and they already have my 60 bucks."

EliteLavigny,3dwwnl,NEM3S1S,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"Well, we are using PP to build our lore and create news, so its unlikely that we will leave PP. Also, its good to have pilots under a ""banner"" (showing the same alliegance in the scan screen).  But to be honest, we dont do a lot for PP. We fortify our area, help Patreus staying alive, but no merit grinding or dire offensives (well, we use PP as an excuse to do so, but there are no ""strategical"" reasons).  Powerplay is no fun. But its a good RP tool.  There, I said it."
EliteLavigny,3dv2ir,Saint_Flippy,3,Sun Jul 19 19:27:45 2015 UTC,"If you're running Corruption Reports, you can get those from any Controlled System - you don't have to come back to Kamadhenu.  Hence, find the place you're running to, then find the nearest controlled system.  Having said this, the places we're supposed to be taking CR's to are named in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteLavigny/comments/3dhqru/preparation_target/  If, however, you're fortifying the controlled systems, then you need to stock up with Garrison supplies.

EliteLavigny,3dv2ir,McGubbins,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you SO much. I'm still getting the feel for the whole Powerplay deal, and just kimda picked a system at random. Now that I see this master list though, I'll gladly jump over to those systems,  Still, Kamadhenu is a capital system. Being interdicted as often as I am seems... wrong. This faction is 2nd in ranking, so there should be enough funds in the lore to support a proper system defence force, and even without that we have enough supporters in the faction that having a hospitable home system just seems natural. Occasional pirates? Sure. An interdiction upon entering the system, getting close to the dock, and leaving the system? Too much."
EliteLavigny,3dv2ir,McGubbins,2,Sun Jul 19 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"You're right, there's too much interdiction and too many foreign powers muscling in where they aren't wanted.  I've lost count the number of times when I've been undermining Kumo Crew and been interdicted by Siruis or Federation NPCs."

EliteLavigny,3dv2ir,Cmdr_Darkwatch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:47:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm... sounds like a basic misunderstanding of how Power Play Preparation works. Which is fine, it's been happening a lot over the past month and a half.  Every system that is not currently exploited or controlled by a Power can accept Corruption Reports. Only the top 10 systems currently receiving them are on our Power's Preparation Tab. It is the largest contributor to grand strategy, and the easiest place for strategy to be led astray. Just because a system can accept Corruption Reports, does not mean it is worth Preparation for expansion.  This is a decent site with Power Play breakdowns and explanations if you're curious. If you're not curious and still read reddit or the forums, then please help us propel the strategies for those of us who are relatively well versed in the mechanics and want to push Lavigny's influence base forwards.  For this cycle, if you want to earn your merits by transporting Garrison Supplies from Kamadhenu to unfortified Control Systems, that's the White Shield Icons on the Galaxy Map (with Power Play filter on), we will greatly appreciate it."

If you get interdicted, one of these should show up fairly promptly, like how system security does in a high sec system, at least that's how I would model it."

I think they made the game they wanted to make, which appealed to those who played their previous games. That's not a bad thing, and I do applaud them for sticking to their vision. The problem is that their vision is sadly outdated. Modern gamers don't want a solo space sim, they want a multiplayer space sim, something they can play with others, a galaxy they can help shape and mold.  When I started playing, I was blown away by the scope and scale and beauty of the game. Around 70 hours in, they announced PowerPlay and I was super happy to finally have an incentive to work with and against other players. I quickly realized, though, that it was just another method of grinding, and I got really sad.  I don't necessarily want them to change it into something EVE-like, but EVE has a solid playerbase after more than a decade for a reason. If they do add in more cerebral elements, the brainless will either get bored and leave, or fall in as front-line fighters doing what they're told, while the thugs will either be shunned or molded into soldiers."

However in my opninion you shouldn't be able to freely swap back and forth.   If you start your CMDR in solo mode that's all you should be able to play.  If you want to play OPEN, you would have to start from scratch with a new CMDR and a sidey.   i.e.  It should be a conscious decision which game you want to play at the very beginning when you start your CMDRs career.  Solo (PVE) or Open (PVP)"

If they had the ability for Solo players to have a galaxy all to themselves, where the player had a massively increased effect on all simulations, that might be fun. It would certainly make for a compelling singleplayer experience. If you've ever played Mount and Blade: Warband, it would be something along those lines, where you ascend from humble beginnings to someone who shapes the future of the galaxy... but only your own singleplayer galaxy."
EliteLavigny,3dn60o,Jondo_Kobran,2,Fri Jul 17 18:18:49 2015 UTC,"OK, solo and open are equals to impact the economy and politics of the Galaxy. So be it.   A good amount of Players like PvE and hate PvP. So be it.   The best solution is to have separate save for Open and Solo."
EliteLavigny,3dn60o,trackerk,3,Sun Jul 19 09:35:26 2015 UTC,Solo and Open are not equal. That Fdev can't see that boggles the mind. The incentive and rewards (via reduced risk) of flying in solo is game breaking.

But everybody will have representation.   What the legion is trying to do is simple, Make the empire stronger and eliminate threats with diplomacy or other means and then move onto the big threat united with the other empire powers. But the main goal is to create activities that everyone can partake in and have fun, Everything we do has been open to people outside our group.

Sure, the brick wall will cease, and Overhead will be tied to fortification or lack thereof, but until there is an alteration to Fortification options, there's no way to specify one specific system being of higher upkeep than another.  Not to mention, as we discovered at the start of Cycle 6, if you don't have enough upkeep cost to negate the Turmoil, every single system falls into turmoil. And if Turmoil stops one's ability to fortify or undermine the system in Turmoil, it will stop an unending cycle that ends with only your capital left after three weeks.

The impound feature would be an interesting twist... so many Fed commanders fly clippers and couriers these days. We should tell them that proceeds on ship sales go directly to slave-related activities.... Muhahahah  I admit I'm not a lore-buff with Elite. Does anyone know if the Empire was more or less isolated from the regular ship markets and had to build their own variants?

I believe Frontier and other versions of Elite had an Imperial Eagle, which is why they're doing this one. It does make me think that maybe the Federation should have more unique variants, or maybe the concept is that the Federation can't isolate itself as well as the Empire can, so nothing it does can be restricted."

EliteLavigny,3dj80k,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:33:43 2015 UTC,"The primary goal of ""Op:Davy Jones"" was, I believe, to alleviate pressure from our allies aligned with Patreus. We accomplished that in spades. Well done all!  Secondarily, we prevented additional Imperial citizens from being subjugated by the Kumo Crew.  We need to do better if we wish to accomplish our third goal and eliminate the Kumo Crew. I know Imperius tried to coordinate with the other powers, but we've obviously got some work to do, even in our own faction. We were simply not as effective as we could have been.   Archon Delaine continues to see quite massive amounts of enemy activity compared to Archon's own support. The combined Imperial offensive into the Pegasi sector has continued this week, with several systems seeing heavy Opposition and especially Undermining. It's some surprise, then, that Archon has not particularly suffered this week. He was able to secure three Expansions, and none of his systems were successfully Undermined. Partially that's thanks to focused efforts of Archon's supporters, who fortified those systems most at risk, and mostly Expanded systems with good triggers, a crucial tactic for Powers with a combat Expansion ethos. However, the slow progress of the Imperial offensive is in no small part due to the Imperials themselves. While the tactic of focusing on Undermining rather than Opposing is arguably sound, Undermining was focused on just a handful of the Kumo Crew systems, mostly those bordering Imperial space. Many of Archon's systems were completely untouched even though they were not Fortified, while already Fortified systems were heavily Over-Undermined by the Imperial Attackers. This is not a mistake unique to this particular offensive, but it's one that has helped Archon immensely."

EliteLavigny,3dcaul,McFergus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:30:22 2015 UTC,"Not quite correct, Mike Evens explains it here:    Systems go into turmoil to offset the deficit the power might have gotten itself into. The highest upkeep costing systems get flagged first and if you remove it's upkeep from the deficit and you're still in debt then you have to flag another and so on. Undermining a control system vastly increases it's upkeep and can thus introduce turmoil and will likely be the system to be chosen because of it's increased upkeep cost that tick.   Edit: Unless you know if there has been any changes since then?"
EliteLavigny,3dcaul,RemyGreaves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:53:24 2015 UTC,"Last week I believe I saw something about them changing it, now if it's implemented yet I don't know.  As it stands now if the majority of anyone's systems fall to undermining turmoil is very likely.  Not the kind of turmoil we went through here but They would lose the system."
EliteLavigny,3dcaul,AYKP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"I think they said the new system MAY allow you to undermine over 1000% to cancel the fortification and make that system go to turmoil. Sounds much better, but I haven't seen them say its in game: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=163495&p=2493707&viewfull=1#post2493707 On a somewhat related note, we’re also considering the concept of introducing a “collapse” state for systems that are undermined massively. It could be something like: if you undermine more than a thousand percent (for example) more than the fortification carried out, the system enters collapse. Repeating this feat on a system already collapsing would cause it to revolt and become a free agent, even if its controlling power was not running a CC deficit."

The legion is really happy  about this news as it seemed likely he would die, we even had a contingency statement drafted up. Now either by coincidence  or because, When ALD hit number 1 in power play the first article about the emperor recovering hit the press. So the plan became clear if it wasn't by chance. Keep the empire united and strong against our enemies, and keep Arissa on top. To influence the emperors fate, Hypothetical example Torval is number 1 over us.

EliteLavigny,3d8xxq,DMHawker,5,Tue Jul 14 13:51:54 2015 UTC,"Long story short>  The Emperor announces he is actually the father of  Arissa Lavigny and he plans to marry Arissa's mother.  This would legitamise Arissa and place her as Heir Apparant.  Chancellor Blaine supports the Princess also.  Just before the wedding an attempt is made on the Emperor's life resulting in him being stuck in a coma.  Arissa investigates and the evidence points the finger at an Emporer's Grace chapter in Patreus space.  Arissa kicks in the doors and a lot of ass and Patreus denies all knowledge.  With no clear line of succession the Empire is thrown into an uneasy balancing act with Senator Patreus championing the cuase of election to Emporer by merit, Torval pulling strings and Aisling (daughter of the Emporer's exiled and disowned son) courting the media with anti-establishment politics such as the banning of Imperial Slavery.  Arissa mobilises the Shield of Justice security forces and vows to serve the Empire and keep it strong and safe.  Some months later Chancellor Blaine announces the Emporer is taking a turn for the better and is expected to recover.  Now he's back and presumably the wedding is back on.  If it goes ahead I can't see how Patreus, Torval or Aisling can realistically oppose Arissa as the rightful Heir.  Should a successful assassination of the Emporer be pulled off suspicion would be on both the Feds and Patreus/Torval/Aisling forcing Arissa to take the Imperial Throne for the good of the Empire prompting an all out succession war."

The thing is, because is can land at outposts, it can use trade routes that vastly exceed your 2100/ton (I have three that exceed 3500/ton all the time, and go above 3800 at high-tide) and do it faster, because a) it has a higher jump range, and b) landing and certainly leaving at an outpost is faster. I did the math and two of these routes outstrip a Type-9 doing the same route for 2200/ton, and that's only if they did it at the same speed - which they wouldn't.  It can also be re-outfitted as the absolute Death of NPCs. Mine right now (which I named Arissa's Hammer ;)), with the help & advice of Droid8Apple, is fitted specifically for CZs, and it just utterly ends them (exaggeration for effect, of course, they don't end by player action).

EliteLavigny,3dbutx,Endincite,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:24:56 2015 UTC,You can do an easy 5-6m in the Anaconda. That's about 2600cr/T  routes. The jump distance and capacity are what play into it. If you have the python it will access smaller stations with massive cr/T like Endincite said- but at the end of the day there will times the python makes more trading and days the conda or t9 does. The abundance of 2500-2600 routes is massive compared to finding steady 3500 ones. But then again from what he told me Endincite has quite a few of them to fall back on and can still go shred ships if needed. Soon my conda will be maxed then I'll be making another python because they're like salt &  pepper to me. Peanut butter and jelly. Peas &  carrots.
EliteLavigny,3dbutx,Droid8Apple,2,Wed Jul 15 17:10:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah the 3500+ routes have really only been created by powerplay control effects, so the 2500+ runs should be more common.  However that jump range difference is what makes the anaconda capable of doing efficient 2500+/ton runs. I'm not hearing anything like that from regular T9 drivers..they just can't jump far enough to avoid 3+ jumps for a 2500+ profit, generally. I'm sure there's something, just not that I've heard of."

They're too far away; they aren't very profitable; Archon is ranked 9th; and there's been no real aggression, apart from defense response by those in the Kumo Crew. It just seems like a complete waste of resources and improper prioritisation."
EliteLavigny,3d94z8,psanker,2,Tue Jul 14 17:16:12 2015 UTC,It's entirely RP driven.
EliteLavigny,3d94z8,CMDR_Corrigendum,0,Tue Jul 14 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"OK so let's go on that. What does the Legion gain when attacking Archon? Some modicum of glory when a few systems are destabilised and, perhaps, claimed for ALD? However, this plan doesn't have much forethought. Sure, one round may be a victory, but you're practically welcoming a quagmire of future conflict between the Kumo Crew and the Legion. It'll be rounds and rounds of trading systems, which is a waste of one of ALD's more valuable military resources: the Legion. I'd wager that Archon would hold its ground (maybe losing a couple of its outer systems); meanwhile, the Federation (both Winters and Hudson) would have a great opportunity to cut into our territory and carve out some of our more valuable border systems.  Tactically, this mission seems completely pointless with a massive potential for ALD system loss."
EliteLavigny,3d94z8,psanker,3,Tue Jul 14 20:01:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're thinking tactically again, not Role Playing. I grant you, this makes no sense tactically. That's not why this was undertaken. Here's how I see it. Arissa is the champion of justice, while Archon is the champion of villanny. Natural enemies if you ask me. Claiming Cuchua, deep in Patreus territory, was all the provocation that was needed. On top of opposing us in Pancienses. That was not forgotten. It also gives the Empire the opportunity to shame the Federation because they were too weak to act against the Kumo Crew and save their citizens within your borders.   Thinking in terms of E:D gameplay, many Archon supporters have jumped ship. Some have joined us, or other powers or left PP entirely. They feel betrayed by FD over the Cytoscrambler, etc, etc. Who knows, if Archon is eliminated it is possible another power will be raised in its place? Perhaps one that more people would identify with?  If nothing else, our PvPers enjoy knowing they can find other PvPers who will fight with honor. If that means trucking hundreds of light years, they are happy to do that."
EliteLavigny,3d94z8,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:53:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly, your saying what I've been thinking. I've been trying to exploit this opportunity because its a very good trade off. You fight Archon, we fight you, and you don't muster up the coordination to do much about it. I'd be surprised if the ALD faction are number 1 next week or if they have a huge amount of CC to spend. Some of your systems are really far away from the hq and close to our territory. My job is to minimize your income next cycle and I'd say that has already been achieved."
EliteLavigny,3d94z8,ScottDaltonSD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"Quite honestly, given how demoralized the Fed factions were recently, you guys deserved a break. There seems to be a prevailing assumption that we want to be this huge, bloated power. I'd be more happy with an Antal sized power. Your undermining is helping us more than hurting us. We could do with a few less systems to worry about. That is what really pissed me off when FD arbitrarily changed the Overhead formula."
EliteLavigny,3d94z8,CMDR_Corrigendum,0,Tue Jul 14 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"Thing is, you don't want certain systems because of their overhead costs but you do want other systems because of their strategic position I would assume. If your guys keep cancelling our undermining, which you are, you don't lose the system but you still have to pay the same upkeep cost. Thus lowering your potential CC next turn. If there any slip ups in what systems are prepared next turn, it hurts more because of not having enough CC to fix it next time. You can only nab so many places from now on even if they aren't always hundreds of light years away from your Hq. Any bad decision making and execution from here on out is going to hurt do to limited options. Plus lets face it, people aren't liking the ALD love that FD is forcing down everyone's throats. You realize that since that ""fix"" to overhead costs FD did last week and how it got you guys out of turmoil, everyone is getting salty. People want to show FD that they need to stop meddling with players on what happens in PP. If players go against their plans for the outcome of factions then so be it. Let it happen and don't tell us it wasn't supposed to be this way.  Sorry I just went on a tangent there."
EliteLavigny,3d94z8,ScottDaltonSD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:14:12 2015 UTC,"A tangential rant that many of us in ALD share, believe me. There were many possible ways to fix their mess without making it look like favoritism. They were warned their system was crap weeks in advance. It could have been fixed prior to the ALD turmoil, even simply prohibiting expansion during turmoil would have been enough. But as Timon once said, ""You've got to put your behind in the past.""  And you are entirely correct in your tactical analysis, at least as far as I'm concerned. That said, fighting the Federation is quite frankly a boring affair. We both know that the Empire and the Federation and the Alliance will always exist in one form or another. Independents on the other hand... Their fates are uncertain. I'd personally like to try to force FD's hand and get them to release another power. They claim their system will support ~20 powers... Let's see it!"

PP is not just rigged, its a blatant disregard to open story-telling. I found a guy on Aisling subreddit saying him and his friends wanted to work their way into taking Sol.

EliteLavigny,3d4zix,Rockser11,0,Tue Jul 14 09:05:34 2015 UTC,"Well I thought my reasons were clear already. I left to Delaine because I though he had a 15 merits per ton undermining mission.  This was the most efficient way to undermine Kamocan to ensure it would be on the turmoil list this week. This turned out to not be true, but I undermined it anyway with the  help of some ALD and Aisling commanders.  Hudson and Winters probably helped about 20-30%. The very day I did this I discovered ALD has a secret plan to attack Delaine.  Hold your cards close?  Yes I would say you did, I guess its the only way to remove any discussion on something. During my time with Delaine I became more and more disillusioned with the PP mechanics, and also realised how sick I was of trying to ""herd cats"", not my term :),  in ALD. The majority of vocal Delaine players quit during this time.  None of their reddit mods have posted since, one hasn't posted in weeks. Like I said to you half joking, you are the second more prolific poster on the Kumo Crew reddit. The idea of rejoining the biggest player group and picking on the smallest just doesn't sit right with me. So I stayed.  I'm not interested in flying around in a wing of 4 clubbing whatever unlucky guy we can find.  I got enough of that over the past 4 weeks in Winters space. I've been trying out smuggling, and dropping of fortification widgets.  I'd go undermine ALDs systems, but I think there is 0 chance of FD allowing you to fall into turmoil on Thursday (even though you mathematically will again).

EliteLavigny,3d4zix,lolailors,3,Mon Jul 13 17:12:14 2015 UTC,"""Imperial Slavery"" is a misnomer, much like ""Federal Taxes"".  ""Federal Taxes"" is what you call forcibly garnishing the wages of every individual who wishes to be called a ""Federal citizen"" and issuing false promises regarding the dispensation of those ""Taxes"". Those Federal citizens in the Pegasi sector get extorted by the Federation then double-extorted by the Kumo Crew. Who is going to liberate those Federal citizens? The Federation who garnishes half their income with no intention of providing promised protection, or those evil, rotten, mean-spirited, slave-beating Imperials? Hmm, I'm thinking the latter.  Who is truly enslaved? Those who pay their debts through a few years of indentured servitude, or those who are extorted by the Federation under false pretenses? Hmm, let me think about that one...   ""We citizens of the Federation are treated poorly compared to the progressive policies evident within the Empire. The Federation is older and stronger but our heritage is weighed down with the bondage of taxation.

People need to understand that we love this game to death, it's part of the reason we want it to succeed so badly (that and we spent 60 bucks on this thing and want to make sure we're getting our money's worth).  What I constantly fail to see is real communication from the devs. They communicate alright, but it's not really real communication. To get an example of real communication, look at Minecraft and Star Citizen, two independent games that are also funded entirely by people purchasing their games. The devs are constantly soliciting feedback from the community, and making design choices based on the feedback of the people. If FDev was truly listening to us, the game would be in a much different state.  Starting with ignoring the beta testers' remarks about how unready PowerPlay was for public release, FDev has made very clear just how little they are listening. If they truly listened, they would focus their attention on separating Solo from Open, on incorporating actual group play, on making the game more than just a grind-fest.  But hey, maybe they are. If so, great. Thing is, we have no way of knowing, and not knowing makes me assume the worst. At the very least, it makes me have little faith in the game."

Made our Galaxy smaller.  No story or emergent gameplay.  Disincentive for Open Play (which is nothing new)   PP is the first thing since forever that's made me actually care any spec of an amount about one system versus another. Before PP, systems were just nodes in a graph that randomly bought and sold different goods and ships. It was completely immaterial where I decided to dock or do missions other than the (largely pointless) faction ranking grind.  With PP on the other hand, systems like Panciences start standing out as something to fight over (even if it's just because ""you want it? well f you, you aren't getting it without a fight""), our embassy systems start standing out as a place we want to get ready to cooperate with other players, systems with good outfitting or RES start being worth defending from other players trying to take them over for their faction's bonuses.  Yes it's shitty that the PP mechanics keep changing, making the CC calculations a crapshoot each week, but the system has barely been through 6 cycles, it's not that crazy that it needs tuning.  And there's more incentive for Open Play than anything else in the game. Previously there was zero benefit from fighting other players except for the fun of the fight - the only people you could actually hamper were traders, and they would just swap to Solo like in Lave to avoid dealing with pirates. Now you actually want to play in Open, because you know there are other commanders busy fortifying/undermining in Open, and the only way to stop them is to get into Open yourself to fight them, since now the people in combat ships are actually doing something you want to stop."
EliteLavigny,3d1evg,McFergus,2,Mon Jul 13 04:05:00 2015 UTC,"Tuning is one thing, but I'm a little miffed that player math guys quickly figured out that the overhead system would lead to a ""brick wall"", but FDev couldn't add that up during testing, or the six weeks following. Now it looks like they ""bailed us out"" just because they waited for a power to hit that wall before acting. Its going to be a tough fix from here on, because so many have invested so much in their powers.   EDIT: And why can't you play with your friends?

It wouldn't be so bad if could have alt accounts or switch to a different ship in a different station, but as it is I'm not going to fly 200ly back and forth in a cobra depending on which friends are online so I can play with them.  Regarding FD's inability to spot the scaling problems with overhead, yeah it's annoying, but most MMOs I've played have seen similar issues where it seems blindingly obvious to players what is wrong, but devs for some reason don't see it (or rather, look like they don't see it - it's possible they had some reason to think things would work out differently, for instance if they believed they'd fixed a bug which it turns out they haven't)."

Also, by-the-way, did anyone arranging the Sirius thing even notice that Herduvduna is now Contesting an 8cc system with ALD's control system of HIP 2xxxx? We gave them a system which a) doesn't grant us access to even half of the ships at discount, and b) contests a system of ours that loses us money.

EliteLavigny,3d3jqq,McGubbins,2,Mon Jul 13 07:07:46 2015 UTC,"Let me break down the question.  1) farm RES/CZ, but not cash in the bounties until it accumulate to a very high amount, say over 200 million,  2) then I go spend 100 million to buy a rank 5 with ALD.  I will get cumulative rank salary of 65 million over the next 4 weeks, hence I will only be effectively paying 35 million.    3) cash in the bounties and earn 100% bonus on the bounties at rank 5.  My original 200 million bounties become 400 million.      4) As I spend 35 million to buy that rank 5 and I make 200 million from the bounty bonus, I make a net profit of 165 million.    I know I run the risk of getting killed and losing it all.  What I don't know is if 1) bounty expires? and 2) if the 100% ALD bonus applies at the point of cashing in the bounty, or at the kill.

EliteLavigny,3d3jqq,Endincite,2,Mon Jul 13 07:37:35 2015 UTC,"Bounty claims don't expire unless you die, and I'm fairly certain the bonus is applied at cash-in. Jesus man...that's a lot to risk though. I can't even imagine how I'd feel.   Time wise, because you don't yet have the 100% bonus, it might be faster to make enough to pay your way to rating 5, and then make the remainder afterward. In fact it almost certainly is, because you're adding the 50mil/week from rating 5 in the midst of the process instead of at the end."

Imagine how much easier it would be to manage our strategy if Rating 3 was the highest rating that was reachable by a specific number. Imagine how many fewer contributors we'd have, but also imagine how easily strategy could be organised...  EDIT: as for the OP, yeah, it can work that way. You would effectively be doubling or tripling your first week's earnings if you survived through the following two weeks to cash in on rating 5 bonuses.

Someone posted this to a post I made on the dangerous forum and its a great idea!  credit to u/reganheath  ""Instead of allowing players to earn as many merits as they like, have at each rank a merit requirement they must reach that week. If they reach that requirement 2 weeks running, increase their rank. If they fail to reach the target 2 weeks running, decrease their rank.  So, to reach rank 5 would require 8 weeks of support, reaching the rank requirement each week.  So, you cannot buy your way there by dropping a load of credits and you cannot grind your way there by spending hours and hours merit farming.  The requirements each week would be small enough that players could achieve them without spending so many hours doing it that they have no time to do other things."""
EliteLavigny,3d3jqq,McGubbins,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:21:10 2015 UTC,Let me highlight the flaw. You are farming RES/CZ but not cashing in the bounties.  Then why are you farming? Where do you get the 100 million in part 2 if you do not cash in the bounty?  Why not spend the 100 million you must already have (because you have not cashed in the bounty from part 1) first?

EliteLavigny,3d3jqq,LoveToDie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:38:05 2015 UTC,"The total accumulated drops over time. You'll recover 100% of merits gained last week, 50% of the week before that, etc. So you can do it over several weeks, it just costs slightly more.   If you stop gaining merits for five weeks (I think), no matter how many you had, you'll have none left.   Edit: sorry this last part may not be accurate, as I didn't take into account surplus merits, but the point stands that you'll eventually have no merits of you stop gaining them."

EliteLavigny,3cz5ct,LancsPilot,0,Mon Jul 13 16:52:13 2015 UTC,"This is just a personal comment others will have their own thoughts. For me the past few days have been great. Firstly there was the big hit on Thursday and the reaction as the power was disabled for many hours as the developers bit by bit got things back up and running. But there was a different tone on this forum as we worked through the issues and developed ideas moving forwards.  I come back to the game today opened up the Reddit and my heart dropped as I see the first post and we are back to the 'Orders' tone of things. The post then kicks off with asking me a question ""did you miss me"" well to be honest the answer is no!  It also seems as if the priority is now back to ""let's go kick ass"" all promoted under an RPG slant of 'justice'. Personally I am slightly concerned that these RPG slants are simply a cover up from a position of we are not sure what we are doing or what is really happening moving forwards so lets throw out the 'ALD rights stuff' and people will buy into it as a narrative. Now I am not knocking that per see but can we have a reality check. Thursday was just a few days ago and nothing has fundamentally changed we will be in a similar position in a week or so and as such have to pull together and work out how to develop a 'sustainable' position for the ALD power within PP it isn't all about bounty hunting bonus stuff, that is just part of the wider picture.  I am glad you acknowledge you have made plenty of mistakes but is that an after thought or not. My suggestion is read through all the post and all the other posts of this week and consider that tone might be an important consideration and that there might have been a few tonal changes for the better whilst you have been away.  As I have said these are my personal thoughts feel free to disagree and say what you wish. Those thoughts would be very welcome for myself as I try and work out where we actually are as a faction within PP where is the balance of thought."
EliteLavigny,3cz5ct,aspiringexpatriate,3,Sun Jul 12 07:41:10 2015 UTC,"To tackle one small part :   Perhaps a simple change of terminology might be advisable.  Numerous commenters have taken issue with the ""orders"" thread, and every time the Legion has had to explain that it's not to be taken as such.  So maybe just something like SITREP, something still conveying the Legion's military ethos, while not inviting people to take it the wrong way.   Just my thoughts. As in marriage, I always try to say whatever will make my life easiest ;)"
EliteLavigny,3cz5ct,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:00:23 2015 UTC,"It is one small part and I understand terminology is important in that in my experience it tends to demonstrate what the underlying positions tend to be. So when things are 'orders' it does tend to demonstrate someone is feeling they are in control and hold the power and this is backed up in my opinion by the ""I am back, did you miss me comments"". So is that merely role play in this instance or not?  As I said I welcome the acknowledgement that mistakes were made so what were those mistakes?  I would ask everyone playing power play to go through the four instructional videos from Frontier particularly the last one on Control (find them linked to the log in screen) and pay attention to the instructions about preparation and what the coloured dots mean on the power play maps. And as I have mentioned before a conclusion as I have highlighted before from a post made on a number of forums (not one of mine) was ""tbh it's all there"". So in my view what happened within ALD was the equivalent of a few having a very big influence in going out and getting some flat pack furniture, throwing away the instructions and telling the missus ""I a joinery God!"" only to see a little bit later the said chair falling to pieces and being broken because they didn't really know what they were doing. So for two and a bit cycles  ALD prepped the completely wrong systems under the direction of 'orders' handed down by a few individuals who were not listening to suggestions things were going in the wrong direction (look back through the forums).  On Thursday we saw the results when our faction went into complete turmoil. As people from the other factions who are rightly aggrieved have made clear, this wasn't a development issue rather the consequence of maybe 27 out of 30 prep decisions in the initial cycles being very, very bad.  Now for one individual that reality became untenable last week and he defected to another faction (that is my interpretation) and it is understandable why. I believe he realised what his hand was all over through the first three cycles up to the point he rightly listened to another narrative looked at his spread sheets and came to the conclusion that what did happen on Thursday was inevitable.  Now as an independent coming to the faction I don't know how the 'leadership' was appointed are they simply moderators placed to control bad language etc... or was there a vote. To be honest I don't care. What I am interested in is good collective decision making. Many of us put  lot of hours into this game and see the potential in PP. But there is a truth in PP and that is for the combat orientated player a power with one capital system 'only' has no direct influence on their gameplay. They can continue to fly out and undermine other better organised powers at will and have their efforts recognised within the game. For someone like myself who isn't into combat what we are after is participation in creating something sustainable, something which has our efforts embedded within outcomes. But to do that we need good collective decision making otherwise and fortification efforts are a complete and utter waste of time.  And so when I saw the tone of the OP I simply thought where the hell are we going what are the priorities and are they balanced or not. And at the moment when certain 'leadership' posts come up in the forum why is it I feel like an irrelevant player in this ALD faction?  I might be on my own or as you say there may be 'numerous' individuals thinking why bother. Over the past two days the tone made me feel like I had made the right decision not to defect and take a 50% hit on held merits why, because the tone felt like we were pulling together and everyone's thoughts were being taken into account. That is why the ""I am back"" arrogance of this OP hurts, and it does hurt because some of us have been hauling our asses off fortifying stuff for two and a bit weeks here in an attempt to stop this faction collapsing back to virtually nothing, and it just sounds as if the really important stuff at the moment is getting stuck into a bit of undermining activity."
EliteLavigny,3cz5ct,aspiringexpatriate,3,Sun Jul 12 08:46:00 2015 UTC,"I've enjoyed your contributions, sir, so I'll try to address some points you bring up.  1) nothing has changed/achieving a sustaina le ALD Power.  Unfortunately, eve with FDev saying their Overhead formula wasn't their intended gameplay outcome, we still don't have any solid idea on what they do want. Something about control systems and strategic fortifying, which is odd as our Power is essentially incapable of not fortifying somewhere. So if the new formula makes it important, we are pretty much screwed.  I think the FDev goal includes opening your own system up for undermining without fortifying as you near Turmoil, but, well, we simply cannot organize our fortifyers, and right now, we wouldn't know which systems are the worst. I, and other ALD contributors, will be paying attention.  2) What were those mistakes? Well, we have always had groups that prepped systems for sentimental reasons rather than strategic Power Play reasons. Hell, Jura wound up high on the list when the self-appointed strategic advisers recommended other nearby systems that would have still put Jura under exploitation. No group has come forward to claim that masterpiece.  Since our bounty hunter power has combat as one of its focused playstyles, it makes sense that undermining pirates is one of the most chosen methods of earning merits. Due to those merits, it also makes sense to have forward operating bases. If we could fully plan our actual preparation every week, a couple of FoB would be worthwhile and balanced accordingly. Again, we have never been able to ""control"" and only barely ""guide"" our preparation targets. So what are the mistakes made of this subreddit? I think that comes down to the Legion behaving diplomatically as if they are ALD's representatives. The thing is, no one else is doing it. And diplomatic relations are important. The other mistake made by this subreddit is that we post full of emotion, rather than letting them settle before discussing strategy with our mostly cooperative allies. (random response) 27 out of 30 of the prep decisions being bad? That's pure hyperbole. I'd say, at our worst, we came out of a full 10 prep list, with 2 bad and 2-3 not so great systems. Honestly, the original Overhead formula had every exploited system being bad, not matter how nice. So the only ""good"" decision would be to not expand. Essentially, if we had entered and lost more ""prep wars"", we would've been immensely better off. At that realisation, why are we capable of expanding 10 systems at all? It's like an invitation to balloon and collapse. And maybe that was the point. Only, unfortunately, it doesnt seem like we are going to be able to control our prep list now, even after the Turmoil.  3) We need collective decision making to keep fortification from being an utter waste of time. Yes! We do. Let's start doing it. Maybe you can be a voice of reason to reach the masses about why specific systems are worth sacrificing. Please, they haven't been listening to the Legion on here or to me and the filthy traitor on the forums.  4) Falling back. I think we are at a precipice, but I don't necessarily think we are falling back. Here's the think, Lavigny's Legion are bounty hunters and underminers. They have been working their arses off and trying to establish a decent expansion strategy, but without the input from Edgar, McFergus, jgm, myself, Endicite, Darshedros, nymphellon(?), and multiple others, our past five cycles of preparation would have been so much worse. If you want to help us expand intelligently, let's get talking! The Sub had a weekly update post Thrusday night, and three of us commented and suggested systems. Three! We are losing the active contributing members for long term strategic expansion planning. Volunteer and keep us going!  I love the Legion's contributions in that zone, but we simply can't allow one group to have the only say. Most of my experience with them shows that they don't want to have the only say. Usually, they work with us independents, and only have one system they want for their own reasons.  PS - I whole-heartedly agree on the ""Orders"" thread. Unfortunately, when I first broached this I wanted them to use ""suggestions"", which was just no fun. Having a Lavigny's Legion Weekly SITREP would be fantastic. It could include a rundown on GalNet stories and YouTube videos from their perspective, as well as their goals for the current week. This, I believe, would encourage other ALD groups: CE, OCI, VOLSPAC, etc to contribute their own SITREPs. I feel this would greatly improve our subreddit.  Ideally, we could have a sticky for each group, but reddit doesn't allow more than one. We will figure something out. Nevertheless, we would still want to include the collaborative approved of preparation target suggestions at least once a week. We need to develop a good means of communicating about these suggestions.  Do you've any ideas?"

EliteLavigny,3cz5ct,ImperiusII,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not even sure which part of this is the conversation we need to have. If it's the SITREP concept, yes, we do need to figure that out. As far as I can see, our other active groups are staying away from the subreddit because they see it as a Legion sub, not an ALD sub. I know the Legion does not want the sub to be seen this way, so we need to figure out the best way to change this.  I believe a weekly SITREP, branded as the Legion's SITREP, will be distinct enough and be upvoted enough so as to not require a sticky. We, or me, as a non-group mod, could then encourage all the other contributing groups to contribute their own SITREPs to the sub, as until we get a Power specific sub-forum, this is the one place where people could see which groups are doing what."
EliteLavigny,3cz5ct,LancsPilot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:40:16 2015 UTC,"Hi again, I'd just like to say a couple of things here   So in my view what happened within ALD was the equivalent of a few having a very big influence in going out and getting some flat pack furniture, throwing away the instructions and telling the missus ""I a joinery God!"" only to see a little bit later the said chair falling to pieces and being broken because they didn't really know what they were doing. So for two and a bit cycles ALD prepped the completely wrong systems under the direction of 'orders' handed down by a few individuals who were not listening to suggestions things were going in the wrong direction (look back through the forums).   Overhead didn't exist until the second cycle or so, meaning for a while there was no negative consequences for over-expanding. When Overhead was first introduced, it only cost us around 200cc, and no one knew how it was calculated, so until we knew what was going on with it, we decided to stay the course that had been beneficial in the past and had moved us up in the rankings. As it turned out this had been a bad idea, and we had to do a complete 180 in the next cycle, and move from high profit systems to systems with few exploited systems.    So for two and a bit cycles ALD prepped the completely wrong systems under the direction of 'orders' handed down by a few individuals who were not listening to suggestions things were going in the wrong direction (look back through the forums).   ""Leadership"" very rarely controls what is published under the preparation section of the weekly orders. whenever we anticipated being able to prepare, we've posted threads requesting suggestions for preparation candidates. Almost all the prep systems come from the best/most popular in that list. Regarding ""not listening to suggestions"", personally, I've regarded that the most important part of anything I can possibly do, and that's what's lead to a lot of what we do right now. I've had multiple conversations in the past about what I've been doing wrong and how to fix it. The ""weekly orders"" threads started because of people suggesting we have a sticky that listed our current state and what needed to be done.   some of us have been hauling our asses off fortifying stuff for two and a bit weeks here in an attempt to stop this faction collapsing back to virtually nothing, and it just sounds as if the really important stuff at the moment is getting stuck into a bit of undermining activity.   Fortification of all our systems is extremely important, which is why I take the effort to copy down the entire control system list and retype it, crossing out the systems that have been completed. The only reason it's not being championed as our top priority is because we've been doing extremely well fortifying so far this cycle, with our list almost half done in just a few days. Come the 48 hours left mark on tuesday, if we're not already done with fortification, it will become our top priority, same as we've run it in the past.   as far as I can tell, the ""Did you miss me?"" line is the only part of the post that isn't a list, and it's the only bit that doesn't have to do with anything in game. I simply wanted to talk as a person, and say ""hi everyone, I got to go on a pretty fun vacation last week, but I'm back now and I'm glad I get to talk to all of you again"" in a silly way. It's worrying to me that it can be interpreted as arrogance, as I've seen arrogant leaders in the past and no one likes them. I try my best to make it clear that I'm here simply to serve everyone here, and if I'm failing to get that across, or even worse, I'm failing to appropriately react to peoples wishes/concerns, something needs to change.  Hopefully this clears some things up, if there's anything I missed, or you'd like further clarification, let me know."
EliteLavigny,3cz5ct,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:17:41 2015 UTC,"Im sorry but i have to disagree with you. Post title aside not one of the player groups are in control, and if you basing that argument on the fact that a post title has orders in it then you need to chill.  None of the 4 vidoes explain what over head is, in fact there's still no official word form fdev how this is calculated.  Its the overhead that kills powers.  When PP was updated with overheads in the 2nd week - note it wasnt on 1st release - it took possibly another full cycle to understand what its effects were.  Some on here then worked out that it was the cost of exploited systems on top of upkeep. Unfortunately for us as we were reasonably prepared and coordinated we had already made several expansions.  Those expansions were based of what the video's show, green = good red = bad. What we didn't know then was that if that green dot had 23 exploited systems it suddenly became very bad. I think its been worked out that for every exploited system it roughly an additional 12cc in cost.  So for example if expansion system A was going to give us 130 cc profit and was that nice little green dot on the map and all looked rosey. Untill you take into account that it had 15 exploited systems 15*12 = 180 cost.  130 cc minus 180 = minus 50, so its was actually going to cost us 50 cc. Add this to the fact that the overhead appears to be taking affect a week behind and you get the situation that we just had. This wasn't the doing of players thinking they are in control or bad decisions.  We were playing PP the way it was presented to us at the time!  Now if you take into account the players that dont visit these forums or ED forums, those who don't give a fuk about pp and just want the modules, those who cant or wont play with a group mentality, and those who are just to damn lazy to think or work out what they are supposed to do and just go to the nearest system to grind those merits out.  Lets take Guathiti for example, this system yet again is currently fortified to the tune of 2000%+  its trigger is 2500 its currently sat at 56k.  FIFTY SIX THOUSAND POINTS.  Why?  why would anyone in their right mind if they were thinking of the bigger picture and playing PP properly fortify that system beyond its trigger??    So you see, accusing people of making bad decisions actually shows that the accusers have no idea of how PP is actually being played out.  You cant come here pointing fingers at people when they weren't the ones who were putting bad prep targets on the list, weren't expanding bad systems. Even when we knew we were in the shit we still expanded 10 bad systems.  In fact It was posted on here to STOP...but it was ignored.   You yourself in one of your 1st posts here practically admitted to merit grinding the nearest system because it was the easiest. BUT at least your here actively discussing whats happening and i thank you for that,  if half the other indies, merit grinders did that then we could at least have some resemblance of control, however that isn't the case.  Dont get me wrong im not having a go at you per-se,  its entirely FDevs fault, they released PP clearly with group play in mind.  But they never released any tools in game for us to be able to do this properly(no in-game power comm or communication tools)  Its all being done by the players, for the players.   However i believe it takes no intelligence to figure that PP is meant to be played as a group.  I'm no genius but the 1st thing i did was hunt down a player-group who were empire and so i found Lavigny legion and they have been a great group to be with and have learnt a huge amount form them and had some cracking time on teamspeak.  CMDR Na'Qaan is a legend with his silent scouts and i have experienced my 1st PVP with this group(and i am shit at it) but i don't care as its fun, they don't order, your not expected to tow the line etc.  Also Rockser11 i believe actually founded this sub, he's also been away for a while.  So his comment of ""did you miss me"" that you have got so hung up about, may have actually been tongue in check.  Did you even stop to consider that?  Wow this is probably one of the longest posts i have made,  sorry for the spelling mistakes i have missed(my keyboard hates me)"

EliteLavigny,3cz5ct,ImperiusII,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:54:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the offer and thanks for fighting with a mobile device in trying to get it up onto the forum.  The simple answer is 'no' to the offer, the complex answer I am starting PTSD treatment this Thursday and as a result of the incident related to that have spinal issues which may need complex surgery in the next month, hence having time on my hand to sit and play Elite. There is no way I would say I could do something and then not be in a position to follow through on those promises.  To be honest in the last few days I feel you guys have been doing an excellent job I really do, that's why when there was a slight tonal change it was a trigger to me vexing frustration. I understand what the OP was now about but I think it is good that what has followed here is an opening up to everyone about what the real state of play is. This is not easy for you guys in fact it might be impossible. Don't feel form my perspective you have to do it, there doesn't need to be an answer to this PP dilemma it can be whatever it is and probably will be.  There is a level of fun in trying to work stuff out and predict what might happen on Thursday, probably less fun in trying to control outcomes given the current position i.e. no real in game tools.  So thanks again for the offer, but for personal reasons I will decline but will remain stood in the back corner of the room which I hope remains a bit less formally laid out than it might have been a couple of weeks ago when it felt like a top table was there and we were requested to sit down in neat rows and listen to the power point presentation on what we had to go out and do for the week. maybe the people on those top table seats have gone or maybe they have moved into the audience who knows just as long as we all feel part of something worthwhile even if it is a bit chaotic at times.

He's not coming back because of Thursday and how ""we don't listen to him"" which is bs because the mods did listen to him but the vast majority didn't listen to our ""weekly orders/guide lines"".   I feel like I need to address this, because while I don't plan on following in /u/McFergus/ 's footsteps, I think I understand where he's coming from. (Though I don't claim to know his mind, so this is more my mind.) I never saw a post where he claimed the 'sub' didn't listen to him, but my biggest frustration from last cycle from the Legion was, frankly, the relentless push for Sietae. I understand that it is our embassy for Sirius, and our FoB for Delaine. I also understand that the agreement with Sirius gave us 5 weeks to get it established. Last cycle we were well aware of our exploding Overhead costs, and we did inform you that it was a dire situation, even if my maths left out Vaka and Nunus, making the situation seem less dire.  I understand that Sietae would've been fine, if all the other 6 expansions were not successful. I do know that y'all feel it was important, and it does appear to be useful. But once we realised that we were not going to be able to stop those other expansions, Sietae was still well below the trigger. Right then, it looked better for us to fail that expansion during Cycle 5, and Prepare it again in Cycle 6. I can't remember if I ever explicitly stated it, but by the time I looked at the Power's position that cycle, you had already pushed for the Expansion, and members followed. I don't think Sietae alone ruined us into Overhead hell, so I don't know if we could have avoided (I think not). However, that is one specific instance where it seemed like the Legion did not listen to the number crunchers.  Okay, I addressed it. I'm going to eat some brunch now, but after that, I will log on and see if I can find an escort so I can fly my Clipper to Sietae, if it still needs Fortifying by then. (It is a good system, and I'm glad we got it, the lack of listening was referring to the need to secure it right now, as opposed to waiting for a better time.)  Honestly, maybe we need to get far flung systems on our Preparation Top 10, so that we can fail those expansions the next cycle, while having some fun PvP for those who want to act as decoys. If we ever get the chance again, we do not want to expand to more than 1 or 2 systems a cycle. (I'm not even sure we want to expand to more than 1 system this cycle.)"

EliteLavigny,3cz5ct,DMHawker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:39:42 2015 UTC,"Hi LancsPilot, let me try and address some of your concerns:  First off, the ""did you miss me?"" line was meant simply to be a silly comment, as I did miss interacting with this community while I was away. The ""Orders"" aspect of it is simply a catchy title, and we have a big disclaimer at the top of all of them making sure that's clear. The name has been called into question a few times in the past, but each time in the past the majority respond saying that the disclaimer is enough. Perhaps a poll about it in the future would be a good idea, to see where public opinion currently is on the matter.  As for the big RP justification, We're always being asked to thoroughly explain why we're doing something, which is what that is all about. I wanted to explain why we weren't seeking peace (point one) why we were doing this now (point two) and the out of character response to the concern that they were ""the little guys"".   At the moment there's no way we can determine what will be a sustainable position, as the overhead formula will be fundamentally changed soon. On thursday when we we're moved to second place, that was the result of Frontier simply changing our number for overhead, not changing the formula. So unless we're getting special treatment each week, I can't imagine the formula won't be vastly different soon. In a way it's good we have so little spare CC because it means we can't do a lot of preparation this week, which will help slow our expansion, and we won't hit the new hard limit on the number of systems right away.  If they don't change the way Overhead works, and simply raise the ceiling, we'll still be in a bad position no matter what we do, because as we've seen, there's no way for us to slow ourselves down. We will always prep as many systems as possible, because there's no way to get a system off the list except for putting one on it. We will always expand into all our expansion systems because the vast majority of players don't read anything here or on the forums. Our only solution in this situation is to slow expansion by preparing all the systems within 15ly of each other, causing all but one to fail.  If they do change the formula, it will be our top priority to figure out how it works and what we need to do to develop a sustainable system.  Hopefully this addresses your concerns, and if I've missed something, or you have further questions, please let me know."

Load up one round of Fortification from Kamadhenu Deliver to the furthest System that needs support. On arrival looks for some local missions to improve your rep and possible advance in the Empire Rank. 3.1 Rank up and the bounty bonus is profitable. 3.2 If Combat is your preference look for the nearest Archon Delaine system and undermine then... Watch the 30minute clock and return to Kamadhenu and repeat.

I don't know what the capabilities of the other citizens are so I wasn't sure where I should put my efforts.

Whilst I can leave it in the capital stem and come back to it every half hour as I do other things in my life and after 4 hours have 400 merits, what I can't do is drop them in systems with only outposts.

Does anyone have the Income/Potential Profit, Upkeep and general location (nearest Control System) for HIP 32812 and Binjia?  Also, I know we have 245cc to spend, but I really think we should do our best to limit ourselves to 1 Expansion this week. The only way I can think of to force that is to make the top 2 or 3 systems (the ones in white) to occupy the same 15Ly sphere. So, the two preparation targets below HIP 32812 would need to be exploited systems of it.  My reasoning is that the apparent ""hot fix"" for Overhead (which is being re-worked) only increased the brick wall by a bit. Since exploited systems go exponential and then get divided, we will still hit the brick wall soon enough. And we don't know when FDev will release the re-working of the Overhead system.  The only good news from FDev is that they will halt Expansion when a Power enters Turmoil."

EliteLavigny,3cvy22,LancsPilot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:48:08 2015 UTC,"I think the past two days have been a difficult period for everyone committed to ALD. It is obvious to me that we have a different 'tone' in the suggestions being made which I welcome, it is also a more measured approach. In my opinion it is easy to sound positive on any forum when in real life face to face we might be able to discern that the individual concerned isn't that confident about what they are saying. I am making these points because three weeks ago it was easy to think that everyone giving out orders/directions on this forum sounded very much like they knew exactly what they were doing and look where that has got us? I believe some of those voices have now left or they are very quiet.  The problem with many forums is it is easy to sound authoritive on anything to the point it has become the 'default' mode of operation. In truth we don't know or at least I don't exactly what is going to happen next Thursday, we have good ideas, but I suspect not more than that. So what we need to do in my opinion is accept that the ideas are 'good enough' get the fortification covered and the two nominated systems to the top of the prep list and then get stuck into undermining or to have a break and recharge and think the next cycle through.  What I do feel is important this cycle is get a strong idea as to what we have in the way of manpower for tasks such as prepping and fortification. And by that I mean sustainable manpower. So I might have 4500 merits worth to throw at things week on week, this week however if there is a need to fortify some systems it may be a case of dipping into the bank and buying garrison supplies over that normal level. It feels like quite a few people have defected who were doing an amount of workload, fine let them go if that is what they want. But understanding the size of an army and what it is made up with is important in developing a strategy moving forwards. In the past it sounded to me on the forum as if all that was really important in a battle were the cavalry to go off at a fast pace hitting out at some distant objective on the horizon. In truth there was concern about growing momentum yesterday regarding the nominations on the prep list. For me this is where the artillery come in with an hour or so's bombardment on a couple of targets to simply say these will be top of the list no matter what! That quick softening up of the prep list I feel is important in that over the course of a week it could half at least the effort required to prep up a desired system. Yesterday there wasn't an order related to nominated systems when the developers got that functionality back online. I am not being critical rather lets learn and make sure there is a prep list by Wednesday if that is possible. Then it is a case of park up in the nearest control system with a cargo load of garrison supplies, pick up some reports, some bought, as soon as the servers come on and fly the short distance to a nominated system and get it on the list all within half an hour of the new cycle. Set the tone for the cycle.  What we need to understand more than in the past are the foot soldiers. This is the volume in any army who crunch out the hard yards in this case fortification. At the moment I am not sure as to what percentage is being done by dedicate soldiers like myself compared to cavalry getting off their horses and doing the task in hand. I think it is important to understand this because that behaviour might not last forever if horses spend all week being stabled. Though I am not of that mindset I would have thought and bounty hunter worth their salt will want to ride around on horseback at the weekend when all the 'good' action presumably takes place with many players being off work for a good few hours of gameplay. So asking those players to fortify over today and tomorrow doesn't make sense to me. If that means at the end of the week we are short on a bit of fortification then so be it, at least we know where we stand moving forwards. There is no point putting up systems for undermining when the reality is that we won't get there because everyone climbs off the horse on a Tuesday and Wednesday to fortify key systems to stop us being in a deficit. That's when things split some can claim ""I am only undermining something on the orders list, I only have a Vulture after all"" whilst others are shouting but this fortification is important.  So my point is that maybe late on Tuesday we put a post up where people just say what it is they have done this cycle from a 'sustainable' perspective and we respect that. If we do so there is no point competing with each other to see who grinded out the most merits, or got the most kills (wing or not) only ourselves knows what feels right in respect to our commitment to ALD no footman, gunman or cavalry soldier is any more or less important than any other in my opinion. Nor should we bolt on paid for merits if we can't sustain that week on week as it distorts the picture. Unfortunately the post could be sabotaged for a laugh, I am not naïve, but it might not but I think it is worth a try and I am willing to help with it.  We need to understand who we are better and what we are about. Without such understanding there is the danger of a disconnect taking place within the ALD power over time. It is important in these difficult time to respect and value each others efforts, and it is important in the better times to think and feel in the same way and not go running off on ego trips of our own.  Finally well done guys and girls out there for sticking with things over these days and bear with people as they step into a vacated hole. Leadership comes in many forms and we should remember that but the most important things about leadership are the decisions which lie behind the front whatever form that may take. We need to get back to good decision making and that means listening to everyone's ideas and thoughts some of which will be strong, others less so. But they should all be encouraged and I feel there is a chance of that happening now. What we must do is get behind what is decided each cycle and then question it afterwards if questions need to be raised, that is how we will learn. I don't know if we are making a mistake fortifying everything this week, because we can't predict the effects of Frontiers interventions and that might take two more cycles, but we can move forwards in assessing our capabilities as that shouldn't be directly related to strategy. I know two and three weeks ago I felt the direction was very wrong and so only half my efforts were directed at nominated systems so working out in such times the capability of the group would have been difficult if others were like me, maybe this week we can make progress in that direction, pull together and get a sense of where we are at with the numbers.  Just a few personal thoughts."
EliteLavigny,3cvy22,Endincite,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:42:11 2015 UTC,"Indeed, our capabilities will have changed a lot, and at least some of the more vocal fort grinders have gone. I think that may become a serious issue, if we don't plan things out accordingly, as we could end up with our CC surplus eliminated because not enough are fortifying, or areas are too hard/far to fortify effectively.  I don't think heavily fortifying this week has any real negative side. People want to keep their merits up, and prepping to do that may cause us problems. With such a low CC surplus for the moment, every little bit is a boon.  Summary: Examine prep/expansion with an eye toward future fortification. For the moment, fortifying is the way to help with the least negative ramifications. Mass-undermining is great, but establishing a nice, efficient base from which to do it should be paramount."

EliteLavigny,3cwvot,arziben,7,Sat Jul 11 14:03:59 2015 UTC,"Any friend helps in these troubled times.   Only if there is something they can actually do to help us.  As before, I admire your spirit of goodwill. And let me be clear, if there was an agreement I would not be aggressive toward them whether I signed it or not. But we are in a position of power. They are not. We should be using that to our advantage, rather than pandering to them. Regardless of whether you think that's a good position to take in real life, this is Powerplay. They should be coming to us with something substantive to offer, if they have it. The SSPT with Sirius is a shining example of an agreement that is beneficial to both parties.  Formalizing our non-aggression toward them would petrify us into a less agile position if circumstances change. (Honorable Imperial Citizens wouldn't go back on their word.)"
EliteLavigny,3cwvot,brecksolaris,2,Sat Jul 11 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"Everyone loves peace,but this guy says it all.... At what point after playing paddy-cakes with everyone will someone open up their original motive, to destroy us. We should feed our own family before volunteering in the soup kitchen. Nothing against them at all, I'm sure they are stand up folks. If we are spread thin helping in Sirius (beneficial in so many ways), helping Imperial brethren in any assistance they need, taking out dirty grieves ,I mean thieves, fortifications, undermining ,..... Then what will happen if WE need things done. Yes we have massive amounts of awesome players... But we still don't know how many have or will leave and I think its just the wrong time to initiate yet another treaty. When push comes to shove we will need to be able to shove or we'll land on our ass....again....  That being said - I don't think its a bad idea. Just bad timing for a good idea."
EliteLavigny,3cwvot,Droid8Apple,3,Sat Jul 11 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree here. Simple non - agression is one thing, but a pact? To what end? It seems the wrong time to make alliances, just for the sake of making them. Note that I'm a political cynic: there is either something to gain, or not - Realpolitik  Its not that I think Antal has nothing to offer, they simply have nothing to offer us right now, nor we them."
EliteLavigny,3cwvot,Endincite,3,Sat Jul 11 22:03:59 2015 UTC,"I must come right out and say I personally am in favor of an open and peaceful relationship with Antal. I toyed with joining them at the start, and still hold a soft spot for them. I also very much appreciate the level head and analytical talent /u/Cadoc brings to the table.  However, I would point out there already seems to be a tacit understanding between us. There is no reason for us to aggress upon them, nor they on us. Neither of us have any reason to go to war against one another. Quite honestly, our open conflict with the Kumo Crew does more for the Utopians than a simple non-aggression pact."
EliteLavigny,3cwvot,CMDR_Corrigendum,3,Sat Jul 11 14:29:55 2015 UTC,"Oh you <3. I have to say I agree with you completely. Strategically, there is little point in us fighting each other anyway, and we've seen little hostilities so far. Practically, agreements tend to be a tough proposition on our part, even though we're not an aggressive sort. This is because of how tiny and devoid of player groups our Power is. You'll notice we have no leaders, no official threads telling people what to do, nothing of the sort. Our members have voted against such things and truth be told a Power of our size needs nothing of the sort. Any agreement would just be a pact with a bunch of random Utopians that noticed the post and felt like signing it.   It's rather beside the point, but regarding your second paragraph - you guys are actually doing us some harm by attacking the Kumo Crew. In a strange turn of events, bordering Archon Delaine has actually made us quite safe. Independent Powers are considered to be of the same major faction for the purposes of Powerplay, so the result is same as between Imperial Powers - we just don't fight each other because it's not efficient. If Archon falls I of course won't begrudge anyone attacking him, but it will put Utopia in a much more difficult strategic situation.  P.S Apparently typing a user's name in a comment now summons them? I thought it was a gold-only feature."
EliteLavigny,3cwvot,Cadoc,2,Sat Jul 11 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"Well I learned something new there. I didn't realize Independents were cut from the same cloth, so to speak. Thanks for your input here.

These arguments will inevitably arise and we will need the answers to deal with them if we wish to reach an accord.  If their leaders and our leaders want to get together and hash things out and make it ""official"" I'd certainly support that. However, it should be a consensus among all the major player groups of both factions. Though I must admit I'm not aware of anyone other than the mods of the /r/EliteAntal subreddit who would fit the bill on their side. In any case, the leaders of both sides would have to poll their supporters. And independent pilots would cast their lots individually. If there's enough public support we might get something official. And then you always have to worry about the majority of players who do not know about or pay attention to the forums or Reddit.  But if there's no real reason for either of us to aggress against one another, what real cause is there for a non-aggression pact?"

I seriously doubt any of the real 13th attacked members of the legion without being fired upon first.  It's just not their style, I know of their rules of engagement.  beyond that, I know for a FACT CMDRs came into this fight, purposely looking to start shit up.  They're not members of ALD or Aisling at all.  They just signed up for those factions, just for this fight, to start in-fighting.  Members of Aisling's wings got engaged and fired upon for no reason by ""ALD"" aligned players too.  Only reason I know for a fact of this is because these asshats are on my bounty list as jerks/griefers/murderers/anarchists.  share CMDR names of ""Aisling's"" CMDRs that fired on you.  I can let you know if they are truly part of the 13th, or just imposters.  I have far-reaching connections thanks to my tracking system for my bounties.  I know who is with what, LL, Knights, OCI, EC, 13th, CODE, and even quite a few Adle's Armada.  beyond that, ""friendly fire"" happens in war.  Get over it.  And /u/ImperiusII go fuck yourself.

We chased the code guys into the fight and what happen is obvious in hindsight. Code had mixed wings, One wing probably had 1 ALD code guy in it who was attacking you guys. Here comes our guys following a fresh wave of code reinforcements into the fray unannounced and not expecting code to be aligned with anyone but archon. Who shot who is the pointless argument as it was chaos and we both didn't have communications with each other, or know who's in each others wing."

That's it.  That's all it is.  Because trust me, maybe because I do pay attention to the details, because it's those details that keep one alive, trust me.  It's easy to see down in the right who someone is aligned with.  Anyone claiming otherwise needs to learn just how much information is in their hud.  I can do it, and my hud is practically full green.  I don't even have the ""red"" ""yellow"" ""green"" in my radar anymore. I don't need that.  And I wouldn't fire on ALD members, or Aisling's or anyone else's that was part of the same 'side' until they shot at me.  Now, I'm just saying that's how I fly in a furball.

I'm on my phone currently soncant link any builds but if you give us an idea of how much spare cash you have to play with we can come up with a good build for you."
EliteLavigny,3cs4si,DarkWorlds_Foxy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:05:38 2015 UTC,"I suppose ""50 years of age"" and ""insurance claims"" go hand in hand nowadays. ;)  Setting cheekiness aside, I think you have a great idea there. There are a good number of commanders here who are very much into creating and sharing their builds. I sit on the Legion's TeamSpeak and pick some up from time to time as people post them. If you were to get on and ask for advice, I'm sure someone would help you out.  That being said, is there anyone willing to share their favorite loadouts for bounty hunting, pvp, etc? We could probably build a nice page in the Wiki for this.  If you're going to get into undermining, I'd recommend going with a cheaper ship than a Python until insurance is no longer an issue. Most of the time I end up interdicting haulers, adders, cobras, type-6s, the odd type-7, and the rare type-9. That may help you gauge what kind of craft to purchase to get the job done. There's no reason why a nicely kitted Viper couldn't do the job for you (though interdicting the large ships will be very difficult with a Viper). If you get sick of the lowsy jump range, you could always pick up a Diamondback Scout. In the end, it's your preference and flying style you should place the most weight on.  On a side note LancsPilot, I'm very much a trader myself. I've done a little combat here and there, but I'm a trader at heart. There are plenty of us here. Commander Endincite being a prime example. Personally, I've finally made enough deck out a courier (gorgeous ship, super fun to fly) and keep my trading python.  Hope that helps."
EliteLavigny,3cs4si,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:12:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comments guys. The game is opening up a bit in that garrison runs are back on the agenda. I have been saving for an Anaconda and have enough with this weeks rank 5 bonus to spend on kitting it out to be a 400 unit (some decent shields etc...) ship to make things more efficient in the coming cycles. I am holding back on this for a few days and was considering spending a block of the money instead on something to do undermining work with. I want to keep the Python as it is for now to do runs onto the outposts.  Thanks again for the comments and offers which I will bear in mind.
EliteLavigny,3cs29w,Heyallo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:55:48 2015 UTC,"I went from Viper to Vulture and also got bored.  Nothing wrong with the Vulture for Bounty Hunting, its arguably the best ship for the task, but I wanted a change.  So I bought an FDL, hated it. Stripped it and left the hull to gather dust or until I had the pvp need for it and bought a Python.  I really like it, it' got the punch you need for hunting in RES sites but also lets you switch out some of the sheild cells for cargo racks and run missions, merits or a little trading.  And although I couldn't (and still can't) afford to fit it out with all A standard modules working to get each new upgraded module does give a real sense of achievement."

EliteLavigny,3cs29w,brecksolaris,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:10:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't like the Huge hardpoint, not much choice in that class of weapon and although fine in fixed pvp mode for RES hunting it was more annoying that useful. A Vulture with 2 Large Gimbled Pulses is more effective with a much lower insurance cost if something goes wrong.  Jump range was terribad which is expected with a small ship like the 5million cred Vulture but a luxury space yacht costing ten times as much should have a better range.  Mind you the jump range on the Python isn't anything to get excited about but at least it can carry 1-2 hundred tons of cargo while doing it.  I guess the FDL just felt too specialised for me, if I was looking for a pvp boat then i'd probably be singing a different tune."
EliteLavigny,3cs29w,DMHawker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:23:37 2015 UTC,"I love the FdL, but it's a pain in the iron ass to drag from one system to another, so I'm using a 160MCr class-A Python for stuff. It's just so much easier to haul 130LY and fits so many roles. My fully-kitted FdL just sits in Shinrarta Dezhra gathering space dust.

Just because FDev said it would be related to Control systems does not mean we have any idea how it will factor them.  Any decisions about strategy has to treat Overhead as speculative. We simply have no idea how it will be calculated, so nothing we decide now makes sense. That is why I want to limit us to one expansion.  We might as well consider no as yet devised strategy desirable over another, except that getting the most profit for the least upkeep is a good idea."

EliteLavigny,3cqofh,Endincite,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:34:34 2015 UTC,"I feel a key consideration is keeping people on-board with ALD for the next few cycles. So 'playability' is important as many people will first think ""what is in it for me"" and they will then look to ""what can I contribute towards the development of the ALD zone"". So to take an example my first concern today is in maintaining rank 5 into the next couple of cycles because the ability to pick up garrison supplies in batches of 50 is very useful long term for this faction in enabling fortification to be covered quickly with the minimum number of players or to get prep reports into a desired system to dissuade other systems from topping the prep list. So if a handful of systems are open for conventional fortification i.e. garrison supplies, hope the fortification percentage rockets because that should be seen as a sign that individuals are sticking with the faction for the time being.  On a second note I posted yesterday asking about undermining and what ship etc. I tried to have a go in a nearby system to where I was, took out a supplies ship only to pick up a bounty and nothing else is there a good link or can someone explain to me and other trader/explorer based players how to undermine, how it works, what you need (cargo scoop?) as some of us have possibly never played in that sort of way before.

One thing I noticed and loved about HIP 25795 was that it's sphere included two high population systems. That is why its income is high compared to those others, I think. The Commodities station is aa quick 1000Ls from the star, Outpost only, and has a high demand of just about everything, and a high supply of Slaves. Both outposts have black markets, which will close, but Bodiono also has a black market and looks like a lot of good mining and bounty hunting around there."

The last month has been a real blast and I'm pretty proud of what we all accomplished. I've decided to move on from ED, but I'll continue to subscribe to ALD and this Reddit. Just too many frustrations for me to enjoy the game.   I have written my reasons here, but the bottom line is I'm not having fun anymore and feel like issue after issue at Frontier's level has gotten in the way of that fun. I didn't realize that until I started writing that post.   I've been playing nonstop since Dec 15th. Not sure overall hours as I reset my character once and also moved from PC to Mac, but I'm over 200 since the Mac release in May. I'm burnt out and frustrated with Frontier.   Anyhow, I have several Google sheets I admin along with a portion of the ALD Wiki. If you are interested in admining, please advise.   I also have an ALD banner generating site I've been working on.

I am really liking the new Silent Running mechanics, even if I haven't personally tested them recently.  I do think this game will have changed massively, and for the better, by the time the first DLC drops, hopefully sooner. Maybe it is a good idea to take a break now.

They're closer to 5 days as it takes a few days for the server to settle down and for us to figure out which borked mechanic we have to work around.    This cycle does seem exceptionally bad though.  They rolled out a new way to calculate overhead! but it's unclear if that's been applied to every power this cycle, or only ours this cycle and everyone else in the next one.  Am I still having fun?  Mostly, yes.  When it's working, the game is still fun and this community is a bright spot, albeit a little darker without you and /u/McFergus  I'm sensing it is starting to wear people down though.

I'm not a vid game guy. The last game I was serious about was Baldur's Gate, so I'm talking 20 years. And I get that the younger generation has different interests (sheeeet! Did I just say younger generation. I am getting old), and I do hope FD sorts things out and finds a happy median that works for everyone. As it seems their current approach of release, patch, repatch, rerepatch, etc... doesn't work for anyone.

EliteLavigny,3couy6,RemyGreaves,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:01:30 2015 UTC,"From  Zac Antonaci on the official forums...  Hi All,  We just wanted to get in touch regarding today's powerplay cycle update.  We have noticed in today's cycle update that there have been some unexpected results. We just wanted to let you know that we are aware of this and the development team are currently investigating. More information will follow soon.  Developer update: After investigating the issue, what we saw this morning was the result of the overly agressive ramp for the overhead calculation. Which as mentioned last week, we felt, needed to be reduced.  Details can be found below  ---  Investigating Arissa’s woes in the current cycle, we’re looking at making the following tweaks:  We’ve pushed out our proposed change to the system overhead cost that we floated in the last update, effectively removing the brick wall stopping large powers expanding whilst retaining the concept of increased effort for expanding the powerbase.  This softening of overhead costs will also take Arissa out of deficit this turn, as well as angle the game play more towards where we want it to go (less being stopped by arbitrary walls). Alongside this, we’ll be raising up Arissa’s systems out of turmoil to match this change. Both of these changes should be coming through very shortly.  Going forward, for the next cycle, we’re looking to simplify how overhead is calculated, applying it based on control systems rather than all exploited systems. This should hopefully make it a little easier to consider.  In addition, we’re taking a look at player action availability, to reduce the chance of Commanders unwittingly sabotaging their own power: Currently, when a power falls into a CC deficit, although new preparation is halted, expansion still takes place for successful preparation from the previous cycle. This drives the power deeper into deficit, which is compounded by overhead costs. So we’re going to gate expansion behind a CC wall: we’re going to prevent expansion taking place when a power is in deficit, and we’re going to prevent expansion succeeding if ownership of the system would push the power into deficit.  These changes won’t stop Commanders from having the ability to make poor or good choices (you can still expand into low value systems); it will simply stop them from compounded the quality choices (and hopefully limit the effects of any fifth column elements – Commanders that join a power simply to sabotage it).  As an aside, we will also be applying a fix to the merit system that should ensure merit decay is working as intended. So from the next cycle onwards expect that change to be active. Past the immediate future of the current and next cycle, we’re still chewing over the concept of targeted strikes – we’ll update you folk on this when we’ve come to a decision.  ---  Thanks,  Zac"

EliteLavigny,3cogs0,rbstewart7263,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:08:10 2015 UTC,"Basically, since I've never seen how the formulas calculate in a situation like this, or exactly what ""Fortified Turmoil"" means, there are two possible options in the coming weeks. Maybe even a third.  There is no way we are recovering any of the unfortified systems in Turmoil right now. That's all of the new ones, Biliri, Kamocan, Pancakes. All gone in 7 days.  Since it appears that Vaka and Nunus were included in our Overhead calculation this morning, we are also likely to have an absurdly high Overhead against in Cycle 7 (~5000cc).  The question is what happens to our ""Fortified Turmoil"" Control Systems. Right now we cannot fortify them, and no one can undermine them. Turmoil makes those actions impossible. Since they still cost 0cc in upkeep this cycle, the question is what happens in 7 days.  Option 1 - Since we will still be in the negative, they all collapse, every single one. We wake up on the 16th with 1 System, Kamadhenu.  Option 2 - Since they're fortified, it buys us time from total revolt, and we don't lose them at the end of Cycle 6. They would stick with us through Cycle 7, but as I stated before, due to Overhead calculations, Cycle 7 is likely to be another absurdly high Overhead. Presumably, since our systems can't be fortified during Cycle 6, default upkeep costs will exist heading into Cycle 7. Of course, if Overhead is still ~5000cc, all 44 of them will still be in Turmoil. However, if we can stick it out to the Cycle 8 flip, Overhead will change fairly massively. We will find ourselves somewhere around 500 exploited systems, and a far more manageable Overhead. In which case, there is a chance we won't lose all of the currently ""Fortified Turmoil"" systems. We will still probably lose all of those over 29cc, which is a fair amount.  If we enter Cycle 8 with positive CC and manageable Overhead, we will again be able to Fortify (or not Fortify to try and get rid of the worst of our systems). And we should be able to Expand to at least a few systems.  If it is Option 2, we will still have a Power base, and fair CC income, but we won't have the nice clean slate to start all over with. We will have to strategise and focus our efforts.  If it is Option 1, we will start fresh as a new born Utopian in Week 8. Kamadhenu only has about a 90cc profit, so expansion will be tough, but fun.    Either way, we have two solid weeks of Undermining ahead of us, so go out there and burn the galaxy down!"

EliteLavigny,3cnnlx,lolailors,2,Thu Jul 9 08:57:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is seriously disheartening.  I'm pretty angry actually.  This whole mess has been nothing but buggy expansions and recalculations week after week.  Seriously, they need to hit the restart button after they fix this crap.  Imagine that...people working within the confines of game mechanics to actively undermine their powers.  We call that fifth columning.  Apparently to FDev it's working as intended.  If this crap isn't fixed, and the only way to ensure the empire wins is to make sure they're the last ones to the finish line, then the federation is going to be my next stop when ALD's portrait is retired.  I'll play powerplay as FDev intended it and help them.  If we learned anything about powerplay, it's how to remove a power from the game.  All you have to do is be the best and brightest.         Edit: I (sort of) take it back!  We've been recalculated into 2nd place with a positive CC balance.  While I'm glad we're not 10th with every system in turmoil, I do firmly believe that with the ability to prep systems again, the whole ""we can't plan amongst ourselves and reach a sizable chunk of the population"" monster will rear it's ugly head again.  Now that we can once again drop prep reports, We'll have a top 10 systems list, and while we'll only be able to expand into a select few next cycle, if we don't go all in on making sure it's the smartest select few, then in in three weeks time, we're hooped again.  All of the inherent problems with gameplay still exist.  We're just not 10th and in mass-turmoil anymore.     edit 2:  Annnd I take it back again!  Their post this morning has been updated with the changes made to the system.  they've pushed the overhead change they proposed a week or so ago.  They're also simplifying how overhead is calculated, basing it only off of control systems, instead of all exploited systems.  The sheets will have to have to be recalculated.  They're also going to put expansion behind a CC wall, so if you go into turmoil, not only can you not prep, but if you had any preps from the previous cycle, you won't be able to expand either.  This prevents powers from going to deeper into CC debt.  They're also going to prevent an expansion from succeeding if the ownership of that system will push the power into debt.  This should minimize fifth columning and grinders making dumb expansions just for merits."

The selfish people are a problem, yes, but they don't go and fortify remote systems, because it is not profitable, they just fortify whatever the closest is to the capital.  From the casual perspective, what normally happens, is that if they see a system that is not fortified, they will go and fortify it with all his best intentions, without ever reading a forum.

I don't know if there was anything we could possibly do to avert this, but apparently half a dozen of our commanders worked black ops operations to undermine a 30cc control system of our own in a day.

I don't think there's any solution to this, and the only reassurance is that it's more or less the same across the board - the best we can hope for is that the strategically minded CMDRs signed up with Lavigny outweigh the ones chasing a 50% bonus.

However; with no way to communicate within powers and the masses just blindly farming merits - every power is doomed from the start. its just a matter of time.   This leads us back to whats the point of power play? People were upset that it was very unrewarding, the response to that was usually along the lines of ""its not suppose to be a way to make credits. It's about being involved in the galaxy."" From my point of view it doesn't look like we're involved in anything except in choosing the rotation of which power will fall next. To me it seems like regardless of your goals, be it RP, or credits or politics, this system currently in place offers no incentive."
EliteLavigny,3cnlhv,Nushens,2,Thu Jul 9 13:40:24 2015 UTC,"I actually loved powerplay for credit making purposes.  I took a total of 5 million credits, post 1.2 RES farming, went out behind enemy lines, and got to Tier 5 in one week in the power I was in, in my previous profile.  I spent all of like 10 hours of gameplay, most learning just how to fly after thinking I already did, and got to the Cobra.  Took a Cobra and got to Tier 5 in that one week of play.  50 mil.  right there.  still wish I had that profile in a lot of ways.  Now, two weeks later, a PvP FDL would have been totally feasible.  All by ""working for the man"" on a ""weekly salary"" doing what I really enjoy.  At least with my ""letter of marque"" (I mean seriously, what else is undermining) I wasn't just some random pirate  I hope they give the ""power"" an actual power.  I seriously doubt an actual NPC (character being very important here, even the characters in Skyrim have at least some modicum of character) of someone of Arissa Lavigny-Duval's stature would have allowed her people to expand like chickens without their heads.  She would have guided them, mentored them, lead them.  After all, isn't that what an Imperial Senator, let alone a ""Top 10"" power would do naturally?  it's just sad."

Yes over extension is a real thing in mankind's history, But we Fortified everything last week, THAT'S NOT OVER EXTENDED we have the man power and the logistics to sure up all of our systems defenses and this stupid game tells us lol fuck you, your over extended? WHAT? meanwhile Hudson gets to number 1 and they can't even fortify everything.   And if the empire and the federation are so big they have to be broken up into 2 and 4 powers how the hell did they ever get the big to begin with. Which brings me back to how rushed pp is. I'm going to here alot of, Well your power over extended the game's not broken. to which i retort of course we over extended there's thousands of people who don't know what they're doing or don't care and do what's bad for our power. There's no communication system and even if there was do we really have faith in everyone on the internet to follow it, to care about it? to effectively stopping a power from expanding that's in turmoil, Expansion has to be stopped by a game mechanic.

Glad I gave up doing my own thing a couple of weeks ago and can now work toward the common good - futile as it seems sometimes.  Having direction is vastly superior to derping around on my own. It's handy to have this wealth of game mechanics knowledge to guide us/me.  Thanks for listening, counter-pointing, and helping everyone to understand the reasons behind actions.

I can fly around for an hour in Sol with a big ""HEY COPS! I'M WANTED!"" bumper sticker of my bright yellow Python and I might get interdicted once from security (and 99% of the time I'll be able to beat the interdiction).   Pirates play for the action. What makes pirating fun is the PvP and the unknown that humans do when interdicted. Will he fight? Will he run? Will he call his buddies? Delaine gives them nothing to help with PvP. He's just a picture and two paragraphs of backstory.  If I was a pirate, I would stay with the real pirate community. The first community that was formed in the ED universe. TheCode.

EliteLavigny,3cgj2b,Endincite,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:55:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think both in combination with the decay and the balance passes since v1.03, the amount of missions you'll have to do is greatly increased from the amount us early adopters did.  Of course, to my mind it was a lot more difficult to earn money back then. Smuggling didn't pay a quarter as well as it does now, I didn't have a cargo hold to speak of, and I was much crappier at combat.  I think I was taking on the galaxy with a Freagle and a Cobra."
EliteLavigny,3cgj2b,Endincite,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:00:44 2015 UTC,"Indeed. The amount I make now at numerous stable trades was extremely rare, and never stable, as little as the months ago.

EliteLavigny,3cf83d,foofad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:32:35 2015 UTC,Was it your second salvo of pack hounds that temporarily disabled NaQan's ship?  Pack hounds might not be great for tight formation flying without shields...
EliteLavigny,3cf83d,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"I thought so too at first, but if you sync up the two videos it's clear that he was disabled before the pack hounds exploded. I still don't know what caused them to pop. The entire group from that launch exploded simultaneously in all directions around my ship. You would think that if it was a blue on blue, only a few would actually impact and not all of the ones from that particular launch.  http://www.youtubemultiplier.com/559bfb817f145-side-by-side-stealth-screwup.php  Relatively close, you may have to manually sync it up a bit closer."
EliteLavigny,3cf83d,foofad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:39:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think it was around 2:00 mark on the ""blue"" video (NaQan?), he sees you in front launching the first salvo. It's a pretty sight. Then he flies directly past you, maybe within 30m. After he gets a bit in front of you, but before you (orange video) can see him, the second salvo launches and explodes around you. At the same time he starts getting malfunctions, and he sees a small percentage of the salvo come from around him and head towards the cobra.  Oddly, to you it looks like your entire salvo blew up, but to him, some of them went after target.  Friendly Fire without shields is no joke."
EliteLavigny,3cf83d,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"He definitely, for sure, 100% malfunctioned before hand. Take a look at that link I just edited in to my previous post.   Edit: also, I'm blue and he's red :D"
EliteLavigny,3cf83d,foofad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, I think NaQan took damage from both the police and your second salvo.  NaQan is taking fire from the authorities, and he loses power to his ship and coasts underneath you. When that second salvo launches, his ship is directly below yours. That's when half of your salvo explodes right outside your cockpit.  I don't think any other weapon would have damaged him but the 'drunken' pack hound missile. They do take out that Cobra fairly quickly."
EliteLavigny,3cf83d,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:57:59 2015 UTC,I think it was just a glitch. Because all 8 rockets from that instance that I fired exploded simultaneously including those that were ahead and above me. It makes no sense why those would explode when he was below me.
EliteLavigny,3cf83d,foofad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"How many rockets fire in a salvo? Because it looks like 16 to me, not 8. Or is each launch comprised of 2 salvos?  I do know that sometimes missiles or torpedo explode due to nearby concussions, not necessarily always on impact. I once had one torpedo explode, causing the other torpedo following it to blow up, wasting them both.  It looks like your first launch hit the Cobra dead on (as well as NaQan's first launch). Then he lost power. Earlier I said he coasted underneath you, but now it looks like y'all were dorsal to dorsal, so he went 'above' you, possibly directly into the launch path. Your second launch, first salvo exploded all around you, because I think a couple of them hit NaQan, and the concussion caused the others to explode above you. The second launch's second salvo did continue on to target. And your third launch wiped the Cobra out.  At 1:48 on NaQan's orange video, you see the trails of your second launch's first salvo. They immediately disappear, but don't explode. NaQan also does not take any more damage than he already was.  That is what I'm seeing. Now, that doesn't mean it isn't also a glitch. It looks like it should have been friendly fire, but I didn't see NaQan take any extra damage. This sounds like something worth testing or at least documenting more video of so you can send into FDev to see if it is a glitch, or if random explosions are working as intended."

EliteLavigny,3cdiuk,Endincite,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:54:55 2015 UTC,Welcome on board!  If you're planning to earn merits by BH/Crime Sweeps you will waste a lot of time to do so (1merit per ship = 100 ships destroyed per week to get to rank 2).  As I am a Bounty Hunter myself my strategy to keep the rank 2 (BH bonus) with lowest effort is to do 2 fortify/prepare runs with my ASP (costs ~1mil CR to skip all waiting time) which takes ~30mins and then I have rest of the week to enjoy shooting down pirates.
EliteLavigny,3cdiuk,trikson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:55:52 2015 UTC,or you could just go undermining a system (interdicting ships there) for ~30 minutes to get the same amount of merits (if not more) without paying any credits.

In all of 10 hours in-game I got my A-rated FSD 100T T6. way I see it, Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark needed credits as normal people to make a change. Why should I be any different?  So credits has been the name of the game for me right now, but I have my Cobra parked in my ""home turf"" PvP ready for griefers like AED and [Unknown].  I live for interdictions, CZs, and other combat orientated shenanigans... even RES ""farming"" as long as I'm with friends.  But it all costs credits.  Even my little Cobra ain't exactly ""cheap.""  I'll burn through a good chunk of credits just in ammo on that girl in an evening running undermining.  Say you want so fortify a system (something we can all agree we desperately need right now) and are running from say Kamadhenu to Amenta and back, but want to make some credits on a quick 3-stop along the way?  you can with this... easily.  Just found a route that if ran hard can be done in about 20 minutes, making over 1MIL/hr average in a 90T T6 (basically a new guy with 10T of documents).  both ways.

EliteLavigny,3cc7xx,Endincite,2,Mon Jul 6 20:02:07 2015 UTC,Hey! Thanks for bringing a new tool to our attention! I'll be checking this out myself as soon as I get the opportunity.  I'm interested in the opinion of /u/Endincite when he gets the chance to have a look.
EliteLavigny,3cc7xx,psanker,2,Mon Jul 6 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, then. I tried this tool a little while ago. The visuals and the presentation of data is good, although it took some getting used to.    I'd like some other options, though, especially the age of the data - this is rather crucial, since many out of the way stations may not have been recorded in weeks or months. I tried to see if it brought up some of my best current routes, and the data was pre-Powerplay at least. I'd also like to see an info page to see where they're getting some of their info, like travel time etc. Not saying its wrong.   That said,   All tools are good, because even with my experience, using the galaxy map only to find trades is massively time consuming and gives sub-optimal results. And most players probably don't have the patience I had to build a circuit out of 600+ visited stations. There's an awful lot of duds, that look like goldmines on the galaxy map. This at least has the capacity to bring CMDRs out to places they might not otherwise go. CMDRs who stick to the same trade route are possibly the most likely players to complain about the game being ""a grind"", when simply moving around more makes it feel much less so."
EliteLavigny,3cc7xx,brecksolaris,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:30:52 2015 UTC,"It looks like it's pulling from EDDB, so you can look up the target stations on EDDB to verify data age. But yes, the app should probably display data age for stations when you hover your cursor over the stop dot."

One time I made 400/T instead of 1200/T But on another I made 2300/T instead of the proposed 1600/T So it averaged out lol Also this route had no illicit goods nor slaves or tobacco. So yep I'd say it works rather well. I enjoy it because of its UI and mapping. I just created a new route. Still grinding Imperial rep via trade and smuggling lol

Our path to victory is fugly and I envy that everyone gets to learn from our mistakes - but whatever, its kinda fun trying to sort them out to begin with."
EliteLavigny,3caty4,Endincite,2,Tue Jul 7 01:54:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, but other factions have their own, far worse and potentially permanent mistakes to live with. Ill take our road over theirs. I read the other subs and just want to scream ""are you f'in kidding me?"" Greedy little kids.  I'm in ALD for good, because at least we have some solid long - term thinkers... like yourself."
EliteLavigny,3caty4,Necrophymm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:00:04 2015 UTC,"agreed.  Its very much like watching a child play a strategy game.  Every move he makes is sub-optimal and poorly concieved (if any thought went into it at all) and yet he stubbornly survives for 1800 years and eventually wins anyway.  Ya, I can take over the world in 170 turns...but...he still pulled it off <3"

Select a system, select an object, then deselect it. You should get the system summary on the left side of the screen.  Scroll down until you see the local factions. If there is a cz in the system, two or more factions will have war status. Boom status can show up in that same area, which may indicate seeking luxuries.  That reminds me -- does anyone have a comprehensive list of all the systems in Lavigny space? Tracking system status might help us understand what's going on in the faction better."

Tracking system status might help us understand what's going on in the faction better.   600+ systems? No. It would be best to start with lowest upkeep, as these we are least likely to lose. CZs have proven difficult to track, as they are fleeting and must be manually reported. There's enough systems in, say our ten lowest upkeep zones, that if watched there'd always be a couple CZs around - but even that is a lot of systems."

They're called crime sweeps, and you only get 1 per kill, so focus on the easiest stuff - eagles etc. Have a look at the Campaign Headquarters link, then Tutorials. Everything to do in our faction is explained there.  Note that this week we're trying to limit what we do, after hyperexpanding ourselves into turmoil.

Vaka and Nunus are lost, no matter what we do. But, if we carry on at the rate that we currently are, we will expand into 7 of the currently listed expansion systems, and lose an additional ~3 control systems to turmoil.  That's not bad. And here's the kicker - by my current calcs, we gain 6 exploited systems and 2 extra control systems, and still have profit CC to expand in 2 cycles time. We're cutting away dead wood, and keeping the higher profit control systems to balance the overhead.  So chin up pilots. There's light at the end of the tunnel.

I suppose defections might not be as prevalent as expected, but I'd still expect many to leave or simply stop participating. I'm a long-term gamer (i.e. there's a few games I've spent a couple years playing, and I really don't even buy them if I don't think there's a chance of that) but we're outnumbered by the shiny-new-thing crowd, and probably always will be."
EliteLavigny,3c5fyc,Endincite,2,Sun Jul 5 03:58:52 2015 UTC,"Now that the weapons are out of the way, I imagine if anything people will join ALD and Torval more. Simply because of the rank bonuses that help making money."
EliteLavigny,3c5fyc,alienangel2,2,Sun Jul 5 23:18:25 2015 UTC,"Yes I would think so. What's Torval's rating bonus? Their control effect + dividend is pretty staggering as it is.

EliteLavigny,3c5fyc,Endincite,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:23:38 2015 UTC,I think I'm talking about their control effect too (5%-20% of your trading profit in controlled/exploited systems as a bonus). I remain somewhat confused about the interplay between your rating's benefit and the benefit enjoyed by everyone in your control/exploited territories.
EliteLavigny,3c5fyc,alienangel2,2,Mon Jul 6 00:09:41 2015 UTC,"The control effect is doubled supply/demand for I. Slaves, with a...something % price reduction in control systems. That applies to the system, regardless of player. All powerplay players get a dividend for trading in your own territory, but I should really look at the %. If they also get a rating bonus to that, iot would make them the absolute trade powerhouse, which might explain why EIC signed up.  EDIT: Ok yeah apparently they get a bonus to trade dividends. Man if I hadn't been so combat-minded when powerplay came out (I had just finished building Centum, so I was done with trade for a bit), I might have ended up there. But ARISSA INVICTA - I make tons of money anyway."
EliteLavigny,3c5fyc,Endincite,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:37:02 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, in that case I am thinking of personal rating effects. Torval rating 2 bonus is 5% additional profit on trades in your systems (up to 20% for standing 1), and her rating 5 bonus is 50% additional profit from rare goods trades in your systems.  All the rating's bonuses: http://imgur.com/a/QBEsE#6"
EliteLavigny,3c5fyc,alienangel2,2,Mon Jul 6 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"That's pretty stunning. While they remain in the top three, their control and rating effects combine to provide 4000+/ton profits on fairly ordinary,  stable routes."
EliteLavigny,3c5fyc,Endincite,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unless FD delivers on some new motivations to pick different powers, I feel like the meta is currently to force the majority of the player base into ALD, Torval and either Patreus or Antal, and just keep those three rotating through the top 3 spots. Because the only things most of the playerbase does is fight, trade, explore and upgrade. As long as you have the top 3 powers providing systems and ranking bonuses to those 3, there's no motivation to actually bother with fighting each other and having the standings change every week. Especially for Torval's Rare bonus, it's beneficial for everyone to let Torval claim all the systems along the Rare trading routes - Torval Rank 5 players get to cash in like crazy that way, and everyone else trading rares still benefits from their control bonus.  (edit: I thought one of the powers gave you a discount on ships, did they remove that?)  Also 4000+/ton? Jeez, how does that work out? I haven't traded in a while, but isn't the max normal profit per ton still around 1000 per direction? Or are you talking about rares specifically? I suppose if any faction's players are likely to maintain their rank 5 bonus every week, it's Torval's."

I'm sure most of these players think the are helping, the rest don't care they just want the 50 million cr per week for rating 5. Its a shame their effort could be used better elsewhere, but there is nothing to do about it. Prepping random systems is a much bigger problem for every Power, the solution to this from Frontier seems to be every Power has this problem, so its balanced. I'd personally like a system where the Powers oppose each other, not themselves. How about one target per week coming from ALD herself?  Maybe whatever Frontier pick would be garbage, but a common goal that is communicated through Galnet each week must be better than this system."

EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,Darshendros,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:44:35 2015 UTC,"Have they broken 5000% yet?   Yes. Guathiti is currently sitting at 8,439%.  As an alliance player and Mahon pledge, I can't help but giggle whenever I look at that system, because no matter how disorganized we are, we're not that disorganized.  So - how much is 8,439%? Well, ALD needs 245,120 merits to fortify every single system (if done with absolute accuracy). Guathiti is currently sitting at 213,179 out of 2,526 required. That means that the Guathiti merits could cover the fortification requirements for 89.969% of ALD's systems.  Add in another 26,297 for Dvorsi and 25,327 for Ugrivirii and ALD could cover all her fortification requirements and have 19,683 left over.  No wonder she was throwing a fit in the bunker.  ALD is a perfect example of why merit farming needs to die. Once a system hits 200+%, there should be no merit rewards for the player handing them in. Hell - if the system simply told them ""sorry, but we've no use for that"" and made people discard them in dock, that'd be great."

EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,Darshendros,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:18:58 2015 UTC,"I think people on ALD reddit have to be really careful about constantly slagging off the merit grinders when things like Operation Charybdis is launched with systems yet to be fortified which are clear of the do not fortify list.  I currently have a python equipped for trade to carry the max safe number of garrison supplies as it can as a result its shields are virtually non existent. I have come close to loosing it a few times. I have helped with fortifying quite few far flung control systems over the past few days grinding it out.  For sure it would be easy to just drop my weekly maintenance requirement in the closest control system and I have once as I wanted to get back to the capital before going to bed, but it is easy to group up and go an fly into combat as well.  My own view is what will be will be at the end of the cycle, people will do what they feel is right for themselves in respect to their own enjoyment of the game and if they see there is nothing in it for them grinding out a system in areas they don't know so be it. That is why when we get back to a position of being able to recommend a preparation list I feel it needs to be balanced in offering a range of systems which have something in it for everyone. Some bad choices were made in the first two cycles on the prep list because there was a dominant narrative pushing a certain line of thinking. Memories are not that short as to not remember that. So maybe letting things just cool down is possibly a good thing. I am new to this reddit and am coming to it less and less because of all the negative comments which have no effect in the current gameplay whatsoever in my opinion. be careful about turning off the grinders in the game like myself who want to help but who do not see their role in simply fortifying bridging positions into other powers space, that is probably the role for those players who prefer combat and maybe the example to set before criticising the play of others is to fortify them all and then spend a few days undermining other powers. It would be interesting to see in game stats for individual players to see who is actually doing the grinding work in fortifying stuff and who is merely talking about others not doing it. It is also easy for people like myself to swap the python for a vulture and say I can't fortify because I have no cargo space!"
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,LancsPilot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:01:40 2015 UTC,There is an easy solution to this.  Once fortify reaches 100% the system STOPS ACCEPTING units of cargo!
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,reganheath,2,Sun Jul 5 09:18:40 2015 UTC,The downside to that is there might not be enough capacity in a power to accommodate the number of merits required in each cycle to maintain rank for the individuals pledged to it. So in effect I would need to go into combat with a trade ship or loose my rank after a few weeks worth of effort in getting there. That is why there is no point in complaining about one system getting massive fortification because it is the closest. The individuals are doing no damage or harm just so long as you don't want to lose the system at some point and why should you. I suspect many of the people doing it are long established game players with a lot of credits in the bank and are simply filling up a ship for cash to get the maintenance thing out of the way for the week. Sitting waiting for twenty minutes for the next lot of garrison supplies to be released and making a ten minute round trip is pretty boring and so I doubt many are doing that. It could well be the case players dumping merits in Guathiti are the same players going off on undermining operations on a Saturday night in wing formations but they are not shouting about it. We just don't know who is doing what so accept PP for what it is at the moment and get out of it what you can.
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,LancsPilot,2,Sun Jul 5 09:39:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, new idea.  Lets incentivise fortification of targets which require it.  When something is below the trigger, give 1.5x merits per tonne of cargo.  And/or, incentivise based on distance from the capital.  1.5x merits/tonne for ""long"" distance fortification."
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,reganheath,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:20:35 2015 UTC,"All reasonable ideas but the difficulty there is a charge by people on a Thursday and Friday to cash in before a lot of people finish work at the weekend and find there is an inequality in the system. personally I feel guilty on a Thursday in fortifying systems close to my playing area (I am more or less chair bound waiting for spinal surgery and so have come to the game to fill a current space in my life) knowing many are working which I am not.  I think it will just settle down as people decide what is in it for me. I know I am late to Elite and as such am working towards a well equipped Python or an Anaconda to support my own particular strand of gameplay. 50 million credits a week goes a long way in achieving those goals but what then. Personally I would like to be involved in a balanced PP system and making a contribution both in and out of the game but if things are not resolved it will be a case of thanks for a leg up in achieving my goals, goals which I was happy to buy ED on without PP.  There is massive potential in the concept of ED will it get close to that potential I am not sure. I am not sure there is a big enough market there to support development costs. The problem therefore for Frontier is in making a poor call and loosing some of that market. I hope PP doesn't undermine the game but can grow into being a part of it as someone said elsewhere it was never intended to be all of the game and it isn't."
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,LancsPilot,2,Mon Jul 6 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked specifically at it, but I believe it takes at least half of a cycle to fortify everything to 100%.  As we cycle on a Thu 7am that means there should still be viable targets on the weekend, for anyone who only plays then.  If FD implement some of the fortify mechanics they talk about here then additional undermining may create more desire for fortification late in a cycle.  As I have work and family commitments I manage to play 1-2 hours in the evenings (most evenings) and this includes weekends.  I suspect there are a fair few like me out there.  So, for me and others like me it means I am always one day of play late to the power play party, longer if I cannot play on Thu night."
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,reganheath,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:43:41 2015 UTC,i know on last tuesday we only had 5 or 6 systems not completely fortified on wed afternoon my time we capped the last system the week before within 2 days we had every system fortified
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,xkomax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:27:32 2015 UTC,"Here is hoping FD implement some of those ideas then, as it will allow more expansion, which means more systems to fortify etc.  Edit:  I think ALD is unique in the fact it has most of the player base too :)  other powers are taking longer to fortify."

EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,trackerk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:28:37 2015 UTC,So if this is your view are you happy to pick up the 5000 merits a week worth of fortification I have been doing for the faction over the past couple of cycles. From what I observed on Wednesday evening was the ALD faction struggling to fortify the existing systems into the early hours in an attempt to minimise financial damage. The leaders of this reddit need to come out and support either a narrow narrative of combat based activity in which case this will become a smaller undermining type power or to say there needs to be a balance of playing style spread throughout the power working towards collective goals. Without that sort of support I will like other simply go elsewhere in the PP aspect of this game.
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,LancsPilot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"idk are you happy to replace mine im not arguing about someones dedication i just say at 100% trigger the system should stop accepting fortifications that way you actually have to take part and participate as a whole not just say hey this systems only 2 jumps ill spend 2 hrs in my type 9 running reports and be done for the week me personally im at 15k merits again probably top out at 19 - 20k again on wed depending i run fortifications and undermine  the point i think we are trying to make is any fortification over 100% is wasted the people just spamming the 1 system to death,its at what 6000% now, they could of fortified how many others if the actually wanted or had to its not a pissing contest it works much better if we actually cooperate and work together not just yea i ran my 5k reports to 1 system that is closest to hq and 2 jumps then im done see you next thurs for 2 hrs"
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,xkomax,2,Mon Jul 6 01:01:03 2015 UTC,"Personally I am not interested in what anyone else is doing just so long as I am comfortable with my own efforts. At the moment I am happy to stick it out with ALD to in the same frame of mind as I was four cycles ago when I joined up to see if things can turn the corner over the next couple of weeks and move in a sustainable and constructive direction.  What I don't accept is that there are 'significant' differences between the various powers with this one being a combat orientated faction. The underlying game dynamic of PP is the same for every power, one paragraph on the leaders blurb doesn't take that fact away neither does a whole load of RPG dialogue on a forum. There is an associated workload attached to every power proportional to its size and that workload needs to be addressed every cycle. If you read 'some' not all of the posts on this forum there are individuals who wouldn't accept that and as a consequence accept that there are people like myself putting in a fair amount of effort similar to your own who do not share their 'combat' orientated outlook on the game. PP is just as much about making good collective and coherent decisions as it is fighting stuff.  At the end of the cycle as an independent I get 250 prep nominations which have limited value in deciding the direction the power takes for the next cycle, whereas there is the potential for someone spending their energy outside of the game on the forums to have much more of a say.  Personally like many other independents on the main Frontier forum I feel I am going to turn off this Reddit and just get on with doing my own thing until things at least settle down. It is easy for others to say ""another merit grinder gone"" but that honestly isn't the case, I honestly felt PP was a layer partly about sustainable development when what it has been about is a layer where a handful of individuals in each power who have dominance in the associated Reddit personally feel they have responsibly, but to others it looks like they are exerting massive amounts of control over this aspect of the game initially demonstrating a very narrow perspective about what PP was potentially all about."
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,LancsPilot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:22:40 2015 UTC,"True, I hadn't thought the idea that far through.  I think I'd prefer if there was no trigger points then.  What would be excellent, is if you could select (maybe in functions) which aspect of PP you were interested in at any given point in time, and then for the system to send you messages about priority targets (like the turmoil message I just can't seem to shake).  In your case, you indicate fortification and it gives you a top 5 systems in need of fortification, updated in real time, based on value (cost if undermined etc) and/or undermining attempts in progress etc.  Not sure how it would select the top 5 targets if you picked undermine, however.. perhaps by identifying the most valuable enemy targets by range.  None of this would stop the reddit/community strategy posts etc, but it would reach people who were not visiting those sites."
EliteLavigny,3c4vnt,reganheath,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, there I go again.  If there was no trigger points on fortify/undermine then the well supported powers would be able to really crush the others far too quickly/easily."

It seems to be more effective against shields and marginally more effective against hull but less effective against modules possibly due to shots spreading out a little bit. This is also reliant on all three shots hitting their mark as opposed to the single shot of the Rail Gun needing to hit it's mark. The main feature of the weapon seems to be that you can continuously fire it by holding down your fire button, something that could be a big advantage.   PS: The 7A Power Distributer recharges power so fast that you can just fire The Hammer until you run out of ammo, power should not be problem for you with this weapon if you are in a Python.  EDIT: There is no class 3 variant, and the first shot of The Hammer hits at the same time as the first shot of a Rail Gun with the following 2 shots following quickly afterwards."

If those stats (such as damage) are for the 3 shots combined, I'd almost say it's a bit worse than a normal rail. I guess time will tell.

EliteLavigny,3c1b06,Endincite,2,Fri Jul 3 21:59:23 2015 UTC,The original forced you to hit with every shot to achieve an effect. this has more power and it allows you some leeway. At least thats what Im seeing from the stats. im curious how long you have to charge it.

EliteLavigny,3c1b06,thegginthesky,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:07:17 2015 UTC,"Worse at what? Shield damage? Hull damage? Module sniping? Should do some testing, like those shield damage guys did (though just on two weapons, so it should be easier). Determine the target ships MJ shields, then just see how many shots it takes to take down the shields with both reg C2 rail gun and Hammer. Then (aiming at the same spot, at the same range & angle), see how much hull is lost per shot. Then I guess you could target a repairable module and see how many to take that out. I bet its better at something, given FDs weapon dynamic.  Break it down, by the numbers.  Good job for Legion Engineering..."
EliteLavigny,3c1b06,Endincite,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:45:13 2015 UTC,"It's worse for module snipping aside from thrusters on big ships,  since all 3 shots must connect on the same spot on a moving target, but it does slightly more damage on shields and hull meaning you can disable shields much faster with it.  I am not disappointed. From today's experience I noticed it's easier to hit smaller targets with its multiple shots plus looks pretty good, doesn't produce much more heat compared to the rail gun,  allows holding the trigger to charge and shoot multiple times,  sounds really amazing and does a bit more damage when  the  3 shots connect."

EliteLavigny,3c1irz,gumbosis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:16:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, given that its entirely a player combat mechanic, we'd be the least vulnerable because of our numbers - which is why some are arguing against it. It gives a very direct benefit to powers with larger playerbases. Few other powers could ever organize enough attackers to get to 1000% undermining on even one of our systems. While they dedicated their whole fighting force to collapsing one system, we could roll through all their systems. A bit of a detente situation."

The small downside is that there will never be a 'polished' game for people to play. My other experience in gaming is World of Warcraft which I consider to be polished but lacked real interest after a bit just a case of more of the same with things getting bigger and bigger, the problem being really interesting ideas never got into the developer bubble. The result was millions playing it but only a handful of brains developing it.  The real world isn't prefect in fact it is full of mess but that is what makes life interesting. There are too many people 'demanding' they get given the polished  ED game and then they will kind of demand YouTube videos of people playing it in the 'perfect' way so they can attempt to go about copying someone else's behaviours to feel good about themselves."

EliteLavigny,3c1irz,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they will change their formula to increase the costs the further a system is fro teh capital, so you could expand bigger than we are right now, if you are tight in a spphere around your capital, but much smaller if you spread away. Right now overheads are just on the number of systems, not where they are. Would be good if we could have more Imperial systems, or more Patronage and Feudal systems.

With 1 gun/shot it didn't take a sidewinder shields down (competent). With all 3 guns/shots on a master dB scout it only took about 14% hull... All 3. But I'm going to throw them on my scout to see what's cracking. They give off a poisonous green smoke when contacting though,pretty neat  Edit: they're quite effective on a ship like the DB Scout.

EliteLavigny,3c0gfg,dzanm,2,Fri Jul 3 17:18:10 2015 UTC,"It would help, for sure.  Any increase in ability to communicate to people across modes couldn't hurt.  I doubt it would be ""enough"" (but when is anything ever enough?  Someone is always going to want more)    If they're going to overhaul comms, then a Galactic channel for each power that reaches into group and solo would probably help more.  Oftentimes, if someone's not doing something that's part of our ""organized"" effort, then the chances that they're in a station we'd be at (whatever mode they're playing in) would be minimal.  Your chances of reaching them with local chat in station that crosses modes would still be low.  With a global (Galactic, whatever) channel I could trip out people in solo with stuff like ""You, yeah you in solo mode, dropping off that hundred-thousandth fort supply in gauhthiti...I SEE you.  www.reddit.com/r/elitelavigny  <- Use it, or we're coming for you"""
EliteLavigny,3c0gfg,CharIieDelta,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:42:37 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if they came out with a global solution, and it kept buzzing all the time while people fly (even in solo, etc), people would just turn it off - easier than dealing with it - or simply ignore it. I mean, it's already hard to pay attention to it with those NPC messages in there, just yesterday we missed a single message while interdicting an enemy, because we're already ""learning"" that unless it's a yellow or blue message it's probably nothing interesting.  Having that while docked is way different though - successfully docking already acts as a ""mental switch"" of sorts, and since we're safe and not worrying about flying, it's much easier to pay attention to those messages, and even look forward to it. Also makes it harder to spam or harass someone."
EliteLavigny,3c0gfg,Endincite,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:03:29 2015 UTC,"It could be something like the galnet screen, that you just go to to see what's going on. Still better than the little we have now."
EliteLavigny,3c0gfg,CharIieDelta,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:52:57 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying, and again, I'm not saying any increase in ability to communicate between modes is bad.  I just think that only having the ability to communicate with players between modes who just happen to be at the same station as you is going to be fairly limited outside of, say, kamadhenu on thursday morning.  If the aim is for increased small talk and chit chat, then sure it works.  But if the aim is increased ability to round up resources across game modes, then in-station chat across modes isn't likely to make a huge dent (except in Kamadhenu on thursday morning)   A galactic channel across all modes could work something like Planetside's command chat. where you had to be a certain command rank to access it.  You could only gain command rank by doing command-y type things, like leading squads.   To translate into ED terms, they could make it so a person would have to be a certain major faction's  or power's rank before you could access it, but everyone could see it.  It'd be a way for the people that put in the most time to coordinated efforts to have a channel where they could reach everyone in every mode, without the riff-raff (or at least not all of the riff-raff) drowning them out  :P    You're also assuming people in Solo have that ""mental switch"" and don't already tune out chat because there's nothing important in it anyways.  Which is probably assuming alot.  I'm not sure either suggestion adequately addresses the fact that anti-social people aren't going to participate in things that are social."
EliteLavigny,3c0gfg,trepnick,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"To expand upon that, go see https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=163530 I posted a few ideas about how to enhance chat in general, but some of them would work particularly well for PP. Default chat channels for a power, or optional ""Imperial"" ""Federation"" channels, etc. I think if a player new to PP got a message on their hud from a power chat channel they might be more inclined to at least look at what the overall priorities are for a power instead of just merit grinding useless systems.  OFC, this would all help Hudson the most. They could scream at players endlessly forting Sol more easily :P"
EliteLavigny,3c0gfg,CharIieDelta,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"or we could scream at people pumping fort supplies into gauthiti to the tune of four THOUSAND percent of the trigger.  :P  Wednesday night when I looked, we still had 3 systems on the list not fully fortified, and gauthiti was at 4000% past it's trigger.  It would have taken something like only 10% of the overage in gauthiti to fully fortify those three systems.  Huge waste.  Merit grinders are gonna merit grind though.  More communication is desperately needed.  They could ship us bundles of twigs and matches for smoke signals and it'd be better than what we have.

Good job everyone, enjoy the rewards of our victory."
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,McFergus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:16:20 2015 UTC,"It's a soft 700 limit, right? Not a hard limit? As in it's simply unsustainable and funny numbers happen at 700, not the game has implemented a notification that will say ""You have reached 700 systems and can no longer expand. Build additional pylons."" Or?  Edit: I still have so many questions. If five systems could not be fortified, why would that additional CC cost come into play after expansion attempts and not before?"
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,McFergus,2,Fri Jul 3 18:05:30 2015 UTC,"at about 700 systems the cost of those systems equals our income. We can improve things bu taking systems that provide more income. We are earning an average of 6.5cc per system, Mahon is on about 7.2cc"
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,McFergus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:07:44 2015 UTC,"But how can the cost of upkeep ever go over income if we keep expanding into net gain systems? Sure if we fail to fortify, we won't be able to expand further, but we shouldn't go negative. Unless upkeep is paid after expansion attempts, which I don't think makes any sense."
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,McFergus,2,Fri Jul 3 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"There are no net gain systems. In game, where it says ""profit"" is a lie. There is an overhead cost you can see on the first tab under our power. Thats about 4000cc right now.  The more systems we take, the larger the overhead.  The overhead cost isn't shown when you look at a system, just the ""profit"""
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,McFergus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"And the ""profit"" is only applicable when a system has been properly fortified?  Also, thanks for answering all my questions!  Also also, as our overhead grows due to expanding, how can we grow our CC profits to match? Or is that simply not possible?"
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,CMDR_Bollok,2,Fri Jul 3 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"no, the profit is the income, less the upkeep cost.  We get the upkeep back if we fortify, Right now every new system will cost us 18cc each. 11cc is the maximum income you can get from one system, so everywhere we expand to loses us money, the more systems, the bigger the loss."
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"So when a system says ""109cc Potential Profit,"" if that's a lie like you said, where the hell is that 109 coming from?"
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,McFergus,2,Fri Jul 3 18:45:16 2015 UTC,"The 109 is from all the systems in a 15 LY radius around the control system. These systems give 4-11cc income each.  What we need are 11cc systems, not 4cc systems. We need to see the average income, the total income is meaningless to us.  Its no good getting 109cc in income, if it costs us 200cc."
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I thought when you controlled a system, you only paid that systems upkeep but reaped income from the exploited systems. Are upkeep and overhead different costs then? I don't get why it shows us income without showing us the costs, then tells us it's profitable."
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,NEM3S1S,2,Fri Jul 3 18:53:58 2015 UTC,"And there is no real way to ""control"" the masses.  I logged in yesterday about 10pm BST and found everything on the Expansion list almost at trigger already.  Bonkers.   When you run out of CC, only the 2 most expensive control systems go into turmoil.    If they stay in turmoil (leave them alone for the cycle) they become uncontrolled again.   This is desirable in order to reduce overheads..  But game auto picks the 2 most expensive ones and takes a couple weeks to get rid of them effectively."
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,McFergus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:41:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kinda funny, no matter how busy or active groups and forums may be, most players just do there own thing.  How is overhead calculated then? Just on a per-system basis? Or is it universal?"
EliteLavigny,3c0dy1,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"Every expansion target was reached?  Awesome.  Highest upkeep systems go first, so we will likely keep a lot of them."

It's certainly the only one the organized among us are going to look to expand.  We also have alot less to do this cycle so undermining hudson and winters becomes a major priority.  Tying a bulk of our resources up in Sietae ensures we have less ability to undermine them everywhere else.    It remains to be seen how effective this will be against us.  I've perused IPC's ""marketing"" and the major op they cite as a reference is their paid opposition to our expansion in Pancienses.  Last time I checked, we won Pancienses.  If anything, this may turn out to be a lesson to the IPC.  ""Don't take contracts against ALD""  :)    If we don't want to chance it, then given our manpower and resources, we could concievably open negotiation to outbid whoever opened that contract and get them to run interference in Sietae instead, shooting down other commanders not pledged to ALD.  They are mercenaries after all.  Money talks and we've got more than enough of it."

When I last looked, we were at 175 (a hundred of which were mine) and we were at 1%, so if I flex my math muscles, I'd say it's in the range of 17500.  But that's not gospel.

They said the decision has been made by the community but I haven't seen a single topic on it ( and I check /r/EliteDangerous every hour ... )"
EliteLavigny,3byztf,Legion711,3,Fri Jul 3 08:29:04 2015 UTC,"You missed the sticky post. There was a strawpoll stickied to the /r/elitedangerous page that gave two options  1- Make the subreddit private  2- Keep it as is  As soon as that poll went up, it was brigaded from the live chat. Option 1 (Make the subreddit private) won 250 - 42. So that is what the mods did."
EliteLavigny,3byztf,zThief,5,Fri Jul 3 09:42:28 2015 UTC,"Seem so, but 292 votes is really a really tiny portion of the community, so I guess i'm not the only one who missed it.  I hope it don't last too long :/"
EliteLavigny,3byztf,Legion711,4,Fri Jul 3 10:16:02 2015 UTC,Especially if it was brigaded by people organizing the protest; actual regulars to the subreddit are probably only a fraction of those who voted.
EliteLavigny,3byztf,amarkit,3,Fri Jul 3 14:52:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the poll only lasted for 30 minutes.  Hopefully the subreddit goes back up soon :P"

EliteLavigny,3byztf,DreamWoven,2,Fri Jul 3 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"exactly. They could as well closed it up as soon the ""pro-private"" counter went higher than the ""I don't care about the drama"" counter. Same effect. I was even there before it happened and did not notice the sticky (as I had basically no idea this was happening)....how long was it up anyway?  edit: ok, someone says 30 minutes. If that is the case, that's just crazy"

EliteLavigny,3c0a8l,Toastarian,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"If we were protesting about the sacking of a Reddit executive, that should have been done hours ago, when all the other subs went offline.  /r/EliteLavigny stayed open, so we're obviously not protesting about that.    Hence the question, what are we protesting about?  b) Solidarity is a good thing but again, it's ill-timed.  The protests have already been picked up by social and global media, so adding a very small subreddit to a protest that has already peaked is pointless, in my opinion.  c) Should every executive decision on Reddit be consulted through the Moderators?  This is an internal HR issue, as far as I can tell, which doesn't sound like something any other company would consult its customers about.

EliteLavigny,3bxoej,SpaceYeti,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:40:42 2015 UTC,"Seems to me that those who do know/care should be notified when these things happen and forces should be dispatched to enforce/educate within their own power.   Otherwise, these treaties are destined to be short-lived, toothless and utterly pointless in the scheme of things.  To that end, if Aisling and Patreus pilots are harassing/attacking our pilots in our territory and neither power does anything to attempt to curtail this behavior within their own ranks, then we should view the actions as effectively sanctioned activity and hold the power as a whole responsible.  That being said, Vaka sucks. Let them have it."
EliteLavigny,3bxoej,Toastarian,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:03:09 2015 UTC,I feel those that know/care have better things to do.  I agree that it seems pointless but as long as all parties can understand that we cant yet control/educate 100% of our forces then its all good in my book. Its the sizable player groups that DO educate themselves and DO participate that make these treaties meaningful to any extent.
EliteLavigny,3bxoej,senjutsuka,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:15:33 2015 UTC,No way to enforce within a power.... so its pointless.  You cant kick or disband members or even punish them in the slightest.

EliteLavigny,3bypy8,SergeantJezza,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:35:15 2015 UTC,"No kidding. I have a very vague idea how rich they're going to be if they start picking systems carefully, and its staggering. Torval's folks as well, but that's less surprising, I suppose. Even those who want to stay in our territory can keep up with RES.  It takes a lot to keep up with even 4mil/hr at a RES:   Fairly high end 3500 round trip profit, 6 round trips per hour, x 276 (Python typical) is 5.79mil, in my 80mil current ship. Larger ships have difficulty finding the same margin, so the increase is not linear with cargo. RES are a lot more common than 3500/ton loops, and it takes a lot less ""startup"" cash to make so much money."

EliteLavigny,3bxu2d,CharIieDelta,2,Fri Jul 3 01:55:08 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  Sorry man.  On the bright side, an easy way to make loads of merits (if you don't mind racking up a large bounty on your head in the process) is to undermine winters' and hudson's systems by shooting down their aid vessels in their control systems.  you'll get 15 merits per.  You stand to make a couple ranks, and do something useful for your power in this cycle (and for the forseeable future of cycles)  You could also help expand Sietae.  Just sayin'.  :)  If your uncomfortable with combat, then trade away, I guess.  but if you have your heart set on carting supplies around, you can take fortification supplies from Kamadhenu to help fortify our approved control systems to the trigger...but not beyond!  :)  (Please don't dump any in Gauthiti)  The list of systems NOT to fortify is here"

First leg of the race is from the Beacon to the Station, where they must pass cargo (don't care what) their wingman. The wingman then races out of Dawes Hub back to the Beacon and passes the cargo to the next wingman. Etc.  Entry fee is some gold/palladium which will be divided among the winning team as a prize.

Obviously OCI will have a problem with losing He Xingo.  They have dug their heels in and now probably wont ever give in.

What's funny is we had a group from Patreus do the same thing to us this week. It's Rishair and it's impacting a few of your systems and maybe one of ours? Anyway, that'll be a negative 300 CC system for them sooner than they think. Not sure what it's doing to your systems, but may wanna check in on it."

EliteLavigny,3bun8a,McFergus,2,Thu Jul 2 10:58:34 2015 UTC,then add fortification cost to the criteria and work down. add # of contested systems in there somewhere if it helps.  It less about what system to get rid of and more abbout how to get our CC back most effeciently per each one of these lovely do-overs.  I did so much forting last week i literally do not even wake up for the next two weeks and still be rank 5.  If it helps ill fly around and count exploited systems for the next two weeks.  Im sure we have a few systems we could drop and immediatly replace with a system it exploits for far less cost.  I'm at your disposal. ^  However - does it matter that much what we want to get rid of?  Did you find a way to control that?

Nunus would have been on there but already taken care of.  This is based on amount it hurts us and extremely high fortification requirements.  Helps ALD, and helps those that keep her running.  now if reason exists to keep them (HT or something) we can focus on flipping them - but there are many systems that really slow us down and keep us tied up in fortification due to high goals."
EliteLavigny,3bun8a,LancsPilot,2,Thu Jul 2 11:42:18 2015 UTC,I've added Nyalayan to my post higher. LHS 1852 is a patronage system on Winters border. It will be the forward base should Pancienses fall.
EliteLavigny,3bun8a,PFelite,0,Thu Jul 2 12:04:24 2015 UTC,"The group needs to be careful as not to fall into a crash and burn cycle every week. What I mean by that is at the end of the cycle there are a number of important (probably far flung) systems down on fortification. As a result through the late hours of Wednesday and the early hours of Thursday people are throwing effort and money in a last grasp effort to hit 100% fortification marks. As a result they get a couple of hours sleep if that and are knackered at the start of the next cycle where there is a lack of direction on the forums.  There are people confident in how PP works but obviously some not sure who need to see what happens rather than predicting stuff. I hope over the next 24 hours those people get the confidence in how things work and can then focus all their energies in nominating proposals. At this stage there should have been enough discussion and debate for everyone who follows a forum, wherever that mat be,to know what the ALD core control systems are and to spend the first few hours of a Thursday in getting them over the trigger 100% mark.."

If we let some costly (and far!) systems drop and stop expanding we can focus on undermining. We maintain the #1 spot. This is the only goal we can reasonably go for. The fact that FD said there will be a stable minimum number of powers (some may fall, but others will replace them) means that us taking over the galaxy isn't in the cards.

EliteLavigny,3bun8a,Endincite,2,Thu Jul 2 14:16:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, our definition of ""best system"" needs some refining.

We'd actually benefit if Sirius controlled every shipyard, Aisling exploited every Palladium/gold supply,  and Torval controlled every iSlave supply - though in other commodities we'd benefit from the dividend more.

The only thing I have seen referred to as beneficial to our system's income is to exploit high population systems (preferably agricultural).  The problem is that people think we want to Control those systems when we want to exploit them.  Does our bounty hunting bonus apply to exploited systems as well or only to control systems? If it only applies to control systems, then it appears that we want to control systems with low security and a high amount of RXSs. Of course, once we control them, it removes black markets and possibly increases the security level?  Essentially, to maximise our players' bounty hunting bonuses, we want to control low income systems with low population. If we want to maximise our Power's CC and sphere of influence, we would need to do the opposite, or find those low security and low population extraction systems that border high population agricultural systems."
EliteLavigny,3bun8a,McFergus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:50:20 2015 UTC,"The bounty hunting bonus applies to exploited and control systems. IF we take low population systems we will have less income, so less systems, if we take high income systems we can have more systems. Its a bit more work finding the individual incomes though."
EliteLavigny,3bun8a,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, I had forgotten that aspect. I do believe that exploited system income does correlate to the population. I mean, the income is in Command Capital, so it does make sense that the greater the population influenced, the greater Command Capital we have to use elsewhere.  Unfortunately we are surrounded by numerous low population systems. I do not know, however, what causes a system to have higher upkeep. If upkeep is directly related to distance from HQ and amount of exploited systems, how populated it is should not matter.  Ideally, we want green profit systems, which are not surrounded by clusters of other systems. Again, however, those are hard to find. The highest income with the least amount of systems is ideal. And to satisfy our members, bounty hunting availability should become a priority as well."
EliteLavigny,3bun8a,Necrophymm,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:04:46 2015 UTC,"We need to look at the average income per system, we need to count the exploited systems, and divide the income by that number.

What seems to be going over everyone's head is that runaway expansion IS NOT THE SOLUTION. We need balance. We need to figure out what we need to hold on to to maintain #1 and trim the rest of the fat (or let it fall off, I guess). IMO we need to keep our bubble as near HQ as possible to make supporting our control systems easier."
EliteLavigny,3bun8a,jgmcdee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:56:38 2015 UTC,"the thing we need to solve is the difference between the ""high cost"" the game uses to kick out systems, and the actual high overhead costs we have. Nunus cost us 35cc, vaka cost us 33cc and pancienses cost us 33cc. For whatever reason Vaka was selected by the game instead of Pancienses. Nunus isn't our worst system for actual costs, just the worst for overhead costs.  Nunus is actually one of our 10 cheapest systems. We need to make sure we select the fat to trim, and not leave it in the hands of the game, it seems to only look at upkeep costs. Kamocan and Pancienses will be the nest 2 to go based on upkeep."
EliteLavigny,3bun8a,84Dublicious,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"Right. I guess ""let it fall off"" meaning selectively support systems we wanna keep. I think we're on the same page."

As a result there is I believe no possibility of constructive prepping this cycle because of what was prepped two cycles ago. So if people are going to stay with the faction and are not into combat then all there is to do is drop garrison supplies for a week at least if not longer. I suspect the systems close to the capital, will have massive fortification numbers by the end of the week just so people can maintain rank.  Personally just feel like purchasing 5000 merits worth and dropping them in the nearest control system and go and explore for a week and see if I can add a level to my exploration rank. Its a shame because I saw PP a bit like paying my taxes in that you pick a country and do the work for the week to make a contribution (pay the tax) and then hope the leadership spends it wisely and that over the time the nation you are a part of grows in a balanced and sustainable direction.

EliteLavigny,3bul0b,PFelite,2,Thu Jul 2 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"Its just not that simple, curse you mathematics. What we need are systems with the highest average income per exploited system.  Getting rid of the green ones was my plan to stop us going into turmoil this week, and face Turmoil the next week. That plan failed. There is nothing in game to tell us the average income.  We need to count the number of exploited systems, add the control system and divide that by the income, which we have a nice column on your spreadsheet for :) 11 is maximum, 4 is minimum, we are running at about 6.5 average right now."
EliteLavigny,3bul0b,Necrophymm,2,Thu Jul 2 14:01:51 2015 UTC,-139 here too. Nunus and Vaka in turmoil.
EliteLavigny,3bul0b,aspiringexpatriate,2,Thu Jul 2 07:42:37 2015 UTC,"Well Nunus and Vaka are worth 35cc and 33cc, so if we do actually lose these two we will still be negative. If we make any expansions we will be even more negative. We need to try (somehow) to get the word out to stop all expansion."

EliteLavigny,3bul0b,PFelite,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:49:41 2015 UTC,"No need to crunch any numbers, any expansion will cripple us for longer, this might take weeks to fix if we can only lose 2 systems per cycle."

EliteLavigny,3bul0b,PFelite,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:57:07 2015 UTC,"Expanding to systems that will benefit us once turmoil has been dealt with could still be an option.

EliteLavigny,3bul0b,Evil_Landlord,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:20:32 2015 UTC,but we DO have to expand into systems to keep the turmoil going right...keep losing new systems each week...only that wont work either cause we cant prep this week..so at best turmoil goes 2 weeks?
EliteLavigny,3bul0b,Necrophymm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:34:51 2015 UTC,"If we lose Vaka and Nunus this week, we will likely still be in turmoil, even without more expansions."

EliteLavigny,3bul0b,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Thu Jul 2 07:43:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, wow - we hit that wall a lot sooner than expected.  Suggestion - do not fortify any control systems that heavily contest Torval/Patreus/Aisling. Pull back and focus on keeping the untouched core control systems, and our forward base in Pancienses.  Also, we're going to have to be pretty active in anti-fed sweeps in our own control systems. They've going to be swarming our territories in order to undermine us as much as possible."
EliteLavigny,3bul0b,rdslw,2,Thu Jul 2 08:48:13 2015 UTC,"Be aware that the two systems that are in turmoil are two of the ones that had their fortification canceled, so if we can get a system not fortified on purpose, we could get rid of them for sure."

EliteLavigny,3busej,ImperiusII,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"uh yes/no the system's screwed but undermining cost massive amounts of upkeep half that if it's fortified and a surplus if the fortification is not undermined.

EliteLavigny,3bu9pj,Endincite,2,Thu Jul 2 05:08:30 2015 UTC,I like 5 fixed pulse lasers on mine. It depends on how much cargo space you want to keep.  The Python has enough power (when you can afford it) to pile the SCBs in.
EliteLavigny,3bu9pj,McFergus,2,Thu Jul 2 05:16:18 2015 UTC,Do you get a decent firing time with all 5? Effective module damage rate?
EliteLavigny,3bu9pj,McFergus,2,Thu Jul 2 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"most ships will lose their shields before you can't shoot any more. The 3x3 large lasers decimate everything, even the hulls if you can't hit the powerplant. If I need money I take it to a res site, its much quicker at killing everything than anything else I've tried, and no ammo problems with the lasers. The Python is too slow for PvP though.  Unless there is a massive skill gap you shouldn't die in it to 1 player, but you wont be able to catch anyone and finish them off."
EliteLavigny,3bu9pj,foofad,2,Thu Jul 2 05:40:10 2015 UTC,"I think ""too slow to PvP"" is a bit of a mischaracterization. It's a tank. It hits like a truck and it can take a beating, but it's true that it can't outrun anything. It's fine for solo but excellent as the anchor to a wing.  However, it's still fast enough to keep most ships in range long enough to do serious damage. What matters isn't the raw speed, but rather the rate of closure. At 325~ boost speed, it's gonna take 10 seconds per kilometer of increased distance to get away from you if something like a Cobra is pulling away at 425~. Ten seconds is a long time when you're packing beams and railguns."
EliteLavigny,3bu9pj,Droid8Apple,2,Thu Jul 2 15:57:45 2015 UTC,"http://coriolis.io/outfit/python/07A6A5A4D7A6D5C0v1e1e1b1b040404044f3e58585858585824.AwRj4zNZSA==.AwiMIyvag===?bn=Normal%20w%252FA7%20P.%20P.  That's the one I used for a LONG time. It got me into an Anaconda, which now has everything A grade except the 162m A8 power plant, but with 20% off I'm almost half way there now. I still have my python because it was the ship that made me more multirole money than anything before it.   I chose Gimballed because of the slow pitch speed when you don't have 2 or so pips to engines... Also, the Gimballed large weapons can pivot extremely far and that really helps. I did rock rails on the mediums but they run out too quickly.   To me, with the python, fixed weapons absolutely do more  damage. But hitting them more often with slightly less dps gets it done just as good. Not to mention less heat, less power, and longer shooting.    Lastly, the beam for shields (can be held without draining with 4 pips) and the 4 pulse for hull and components (19 seconds to fully discharge 4 pips, 9 seconds of non firing to refill) I set 2 fire groups: #1 is 4-pip to weapon with beam on primary and all 4 pulse on secondary. #2 is able to be used with 2 pip to weapons and is primary large pulse secondary medium pulse; you can fire the mediums while the capacitor recharges and you have 4 pips to shields. Ok I'm done. Sorry. #lovemypython"
EliteLavigny,3bu9pj,Droid8Apple,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:19:52 2015 UTC,I assume you're strapping the beam to the bottom hardpoint?
EliteLavigny,3bu9pj,Droid8Apple,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:23:48 2015 UTC,Correct. It can somehow hit upwards at angle I can't even phatham. Pretty much always able to hit even with poor pitch

EliteLavigny,3bu9pj,Droid8Apple,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:31:43 2015 UTC,Exactly lol- the FDL has its advantages (though few) over the python. But I alwaysended up in the python again. But it'd sure be nice to see that Imperial hammer in the huge category lol.

Both ships have very limited module slots, heat sink+chaff only. the Cobra however does make an awesome hull-tank / ramming ship.   But if you really want to stick with viper, i suggest using fixed multicannons and a wing full of silent ships, this way you can survive longer by simply having the enemy choose another visible target in scanner."
EliteLavigny,3bp9ws,TotesMessenger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:22:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say the maneuvering/agility capability. Radar can't see the ship while it's running silent but visually, a decent pilot can keep track of the ship. The only defense to this is to have a ship that is capable of sharp turns and boost off out of line of sight.   I've been playing around with the idea myself. My only problem with the DBS is that we don't have the paint to match the stealth. That orange will paint a marker for someone who can decently visually track the ship. At least until FD comes out with tactical paint packs."

EliteLavigny,3brrsw,badcookies,4,Wed Jul 1 16:56:58 2015 UTC,"A fully spec'd T-6 for hauling is under a mere 2.5m.  Put 1 together, park it at Couper Hub in Kamadhenu.  At the start of each new cycle - fly back to there and get in your T-6.  (this is not a capacity thing (at most youll have 50tons of cargo to ship out of 100 tons ... its all about the better jump range so you can get anywhere in like 2-3 jumps) a round trip will be 15 mins (once you get used to it) - if you bring back goods you can buy your next batch (of merits) and still make money or break even or wait till the next free load comes up.  at rank 5 you will need a larger haul capacity to buy all 50 merits.  Run fortifications to all of our control systems.  In our space there is a refinery type station just about anywhere you go - and 100% will be 1 within 1 jump of anywhere.  Either drop your fortification merits there, or head there after dropping them off somewhere closer.  At the refinery buy either Gold or Palladium and bring it back to Couper Hub in Kamadhenu.  Repeat weekly to quickly grind out whatever merits you needed for the week.    If you check the bulletin board at every stop and do charity for the empire minor factions (ONLY the 1s that ask for money) you never have to actually go do them (just immediatly pay) and doing 3-5 will bring you to friendly or allied depending where you started at.  (once your friendly with the empire - your friendly at all empire stations to begin with)  However, bare in mind that continueing to raise rep with anyone that is already an ally is pretty useless.  The rep your gaining with each minor empire faction is applied to you entire empire ranking, only so far as how many minor factions are allied / friendly with you.  By the end of like 2 weeks, even just casually doing charity whenever you stop anywhere will get you not only Allied status with all of the Empire, but you will have reached King rank by the end of probably less than 3 days.  (assuming you do the rank up mission as they appear.) this could take longer if you spend long amounts of time out shooting things - I am a trader so station hoping every 5-10 mins is kinda a byproduct of what i do  Hope that helps.  Quick Empire ranks, reasonably fast reputation, and a very painless (and starter level trading/profit/ranks) merit grinding (PP ranks) all in one.  good luck~"
EliteLavigny,3brrsw,Necrophymm,2,Wed Jul 1 21:29:12 2015 UTC,To avoid blow back...its assumed along the way you will learn to be a better trader or at rank 3 and 4 you wont break even - unless you haul merits/profit -pure profit run - merits/profit - buy merits/profit.  so skip a cycle to just make money.

I ran a type-6 that had roughly 25ly laden jump range for my rare trading. You might be able to rig a Cobra to suit your needs there. If it's too expensive to fit, try an Adder or Hauler. It's sad the Diso corn is not as plentiful as it once was. That made rare trading much more lucrative.  However, if Combat is your schtick, CZs or Bounty Hunting for an Imperial minor faction (that does not negatively impact another Imperial minor faction) will also work.

EliteLavigny,3brrsw,Necrophymm,2,Wed Jul 1 23:10:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one of the biggest tricks I learned is travel. Study the Galaxy map and find, in example, 6 systems in Imperial space. Of those 6 systems, find all the Imperial stations. Then make a piece of paper where you do a loop around them not doing a mission at the same station more than a couple times. This is what worked fastest for me.   And though I had big and expensive ships at that point, I found the cobra was absolutely the best ""rank grinding"" vessel- especially with your funds.    There's missions within stations that will say ""get me 4 fish""  and you open the commodities market and they sell fish right there. Just the same as donating money in my opinion."

EliteLavigny,3brrsw,Droid8Apple,2,Wed Jul 1 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"Banks are DEFINITELY worth it on the cobra because it's shields are crap. Those banks can recharge your entire shield from 'almost offline' to full 3 times.    The missions will spawn NPC ships to interdict you for added suspense.   And may I ask, when you say you want to increase your 'rank' I'm wondering if you mean 'rating' it works like this:  Pilots Federation Rankings: they are what you see on the right panel. (IE I'm currently Deadly, Entrepreneur, Surveyor). These act as a reference as to how much insurance you can borrow if you get killed while low on funds and also unlock Founders World when you're Elite. They also impact what available missions you can get on the bulletin board.   Imperial Navy Ranking: This is what you do missions on the bulletin board to increase. Each time you rank up you'll usually get a permit for a locked system the faction (Empire/Federation/Alliance) owns. These will also allow you to fly the 3 locked ships (Federal Dropship, Imperial Clipper, Imperial Courier). This is what I assumed you meant for ranking.   Individual Rating: This is 1-5 based on merits received within your chosen power. There's a few way to earn merits, and the Galactic Powers View/Map explain those. It also has the perks and advantages of increasing this for each rating.   Sorry this is long, but there's A LOT to learn in this game. That's just a generic description of each of those listed. Keep in mind there's also a ""relationship"" rating that basically tells your individual relationship with smaller factions and large factions. IE- you can be 'allied' to the Empire as a whole, but 'hostile' to an Imperial Minor faction because you hunted too much in one resource extraction site and those people hate you now.

I also want to help participate in the Powers so I get the better bounty bonuses and such (plus having some impact on the game is nice! :))  What is the best way to do those at this time, or do I need to get more money/bigger ship first? I've heard Power ranking up is quite costly (due to killing unwanted enemies and building up bounties against you)  So missions to raise my empire ranking so I can buy the courier? And trade to help raise that & make money, or is the trading just to make money while doing the missions between systems?  Thank you for helping take the time, its a lot to learn but damn fun game :)"
EliteLavigny,3brrsw,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Wed Jul 1 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, then the way I said about finding a few Imperial systems with Imperial stations and hopping around, thats how you'd increase naval rank the fastest. That's how I did it. Keep a close eye on the bulletin board while doing this, in order to accept the actual rank up mission you'll see one called ""Naval Rank Progression"" or ""Imperial Rank Progression""  or after you've completed ""Imperial Summons"". Basically you grind through missions that have the best ""effect on reputation"" and eventually you'll see the mission titled like above that you'll have to complete in order to rank up successfully. Usually the first one is to smuggle slaves I IIRC, and they always usually have a very short time to compete them once accepted.   As far as your rating for our power, when you don't have a lot of money the best way is to undermine a Federal power such as Hudson or Winters. If you want to add me in game (Droid8Apple) i can take you and show you how to do this. It doesn't cost you anything (besides the damages to your ship by interdicting other ships) and each fed you kill is 15 merits. So a wing of 3 sidewinder feds would be 45 merits. The highest rating is 10,000 merits to unlock (an ironic 666 undermined ships @ 15 merits/ea)   Now for trading, like corrigendum had said, is best done with Rares until you can have a decent ship. Rares are fun,  you can make 250,000 on just a few pieces of cargo. There's a Rares run out there I did early on in an ASP that made me 10 million in a couple days. The one I did was the 71 Stop Salesman Route. I don't believe it'd help your rep with the Empire unless you did exactly as he said in his post earlier and sell to Imperial places. But they can definitely earn you the money.  In addition to that, you very well could buy a Type-6 and do regular trading too as well as Rares. I loved my Type-6...  Even though it only had 2 smalk weapons I never needed them. I never lost an interdiction in it. It's fast as hell for a trading ship and great agility too given its role. I only left it for an ASP,  which is just a hardcore type-6 in ways.   And if I'm being honest, earlier on I was like a kid in a candy store. I took turns doing everything I could get my hands on.  And now they're all balanced much better as far as income. I primarily enjoy combat, but there were times when the math worked better to watch the entire 1st season of Daredevil on Netflix while trading, or fading off into the darkness with Pink Floyd on while taking in the view of exploration. There's just so many options. Don't tie yourself down to only one grind and get sick of it. That's my best advice. It's also why multirole ships are my favorite. As for now there's penalty for switching parts... Only for switching ships. Which becomes very noticeable later on in the game (like losing 14 million if you sell your Anaconda).   And no worries, like I said, add me in game. I enjoy helping out new players any way I can because I never had that luxury. If you wing with someone who has more money and does the interdictions you won't take any damage but we'll each get the same amount of merits. I'd be paying the expenses if I were alone so why not let someone tag along. :) ...  I do private group or solo a lot for this reason. I'd rather help live people than hurt them. That's what NPC's are for."
EliteLavigny,3brrsw,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Wed Jul 1 19:37:09 2015 UTC,Incase you hadnt noticed yet - when buying banks for the purpose of doing pve - the B rank banks have 1 more charge then all the others - so itll increase your staying out and grinding time.
EliteLavigny,3brrsw,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:05:02 2015 UTC,"And also weigh more + charge less. I find B's to be more useful when headed into straight combat not ranking. They're also best when two lower B's can be linked, then the mass won't effect you too much while still getting 4 good charges and using less power. Of course this only applies to ships with enough power and compartments. If my shield is rated at 900mj, I make sure that once one ring (300mj)is completely gone I can fire my charges to make it full. They're slightly more effective if you fire them sooner than later for some reason. The dropship is a dream for B rated scb's, can't remember exactly which build but was able to recharge my shields from 5 to 100% 10 times or something outrageous like that."

EliteLavigny,3brrsw,Droid8Apple,2,Wed Jul 1 19:46:09 2015 UTC,"There's a system &  station that is 20% off everything. 15 ships, modules, weapons. What I would do is downgrade &  sell everything on your viper and buy a hauler from somewhere. Strip it into D modules (except FSD) because it has an insane jump range of like 32ly this way. Head over to the station and buy/upgrade a cobra or type 6 or whatever you want. The Diamondback Scout is AWESOME for combat. It's like the cobra but has 4 utility mounts, and insane weapon convergence. It's my favorite ship for that price range.  System: Bhritzameno  Station: Feynman Terminal   when you get there you'll see ""HOSTILE""  above your fuel gauge, this doesn't affect being able to enter the station. Even if you get scanned it does not matter. Trust me. Tried last night. Only worry if you're ""WANTED"" . Then you'll certainly be killed. Lol.  Today might be the last day it is a discounted system, I'm really not sure why, how, or if it'll change. But I know it was good last night."
EliteLavigny,3brrsw,Droid8Apple,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:58:03 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for all the replies :D, so recommend going for a jump ship -> Scout or Cobra at that station (according to elite trading tool website I wouldn't make tons of money hauling anything there so might just go empty) I'm in Pancienses at the moment.  So is the cobra better at the missions than the viper I have now or are they about even? I have the viper basically maxed out afaik so don't want to spend too much time jumping around instead of just doing the missions. Can I buy the scout at that Station? I've been looking into it and it looks nice upgrade before I can get a courier :)"
EliteLavigny,3brrsw,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Wed Jul 1 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you're doing missions the cobra is better. You can stack missions.   IE- In your cobra, say you accept 4 missions: 1) kill 6 pirates in Sol  2) deliver 6 fish to sol  3) bring us 8 grain  4) kill 2 bounty hunters in sol   You can do all of those in one swipe if you've chosen carefully and are in the cobra/dB scout. The viper has very limited jump range while laden, and very limited space.   I came to the station in the time I was away from here and its still discounted and you can still get all 3 of the ships we're talking about. To guess your cost make a ship in coriolis and subtract 20% from the total at the bottom.   Looking at Shipyard here now: Viper- 114,345 Cobra- 303,775 DB Scout- 451,464 Type-6- 836,756  The reason I said buy a hauler is because if you come here and sell your parts on your viper you'll get full cost back on them. But when/if you go to buy them back from here it'll cost the full price you just received instead of the discounted price. To thwart this either arrive and buy all new at discount price, or leave the station and enter supercruise and then come back and your ""buy backs"" will be gone."
EliteLavigny,3brrsw,Droid8Apple,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"Wait... could I buy ship parts from there, go to another station and sell my ship (buy a sidewinder or something cheap), fly it back to there and buy ship cheap again, then sell it to a non-discounted station?  So instead of hauling goods I'm hauling ships? :D  Or are you saying that you always sell for the price you buy at, not the price of the location of the shop?  So I can buy weapons for cheap, but I'll still sell them for cheap and then if I try to rebuy they will be more expensive?"

I have little doubt that, as has been said by others, those who have pledged to Antal are decent guys. And it is true that they don't seem like much of a threat -- at the moment. But utopian visions have uniformly failed to deliver on their promises throughout history and occasionally even brought calamity, and I think this single minded devotion to technology is a very dangerous thing to humanity.  Returning to my first question, I would not be against cooperation with them if it was of some use to us. Failing that, I say crush Antal now before he is as dangerous as the Federation or Delaine."

Anyway - Calhuacan is 1 of - if not - our poorest system from a trading point of view - its hard to find anything at all under market value - all the stations and outposts are poor.    Such things affect the wealth of a system in that sort of way.  CC is derived from population - and to my knowledge - that is static and unchangeable.  Overhead comes from exploited systems, and isn't affected by anything other than going up higher and higher (negatively) by having more and more exploited systems under our flag.

EliteLavigny,3bp48j,McFergus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:43:41 2015 UTC,"In respect to the OP I don’t have the answer, but very often the answer to such questions lies in testing a theory to see if the predicted results come true or not.  Whilst not a member of the group I do have a fair few thoughts on Power Play which I would like to share. I feel PP raises a fair few questions many of them related to how people see it be it in the short term or the mid or long term view. The first challenge for many before getting to that point is whether they believe PP is broken and needs fixing. Personally I believe that the guys and girls at frontier are very intelligent and that it is highly probable that they have embedded a very clever matrix into the game in respect to what some might call ‘sustainable development’ and at the moment it is just lying there whilst people mess about with stuff in the short term trying to fathom out how the thing works. I feel this post raises a big question and that is “what is it that is fixed in the game and what isn’t?” There is a secondary question of course and that is what is currently fixed but which might become live at a later point in the games development. A case of what influence does the little guy have in the big picture, if he trades some goods or kills an NPC is he actually affecting the destiny of the universe in a very small way. Now if power factions were taking a long term view what they would be doing is answering those questions. So for example is the fact that only thing which is actually fixed in PP the capital system? So is it possible to get rid of all the existing control systems or not, or how small can you make a power contract?  What interested me when PP came on stream and each faction were given control systems and expansion list etc… was how people would view them, were they all good choices made by Frontier or not, and if not why not? People could people have rejected the handed out systems or not? So are we saying let’s build on what we are given as a foundation or are we saying lets mould the foundation into a better and possibly more interesting form? Now that is the sort of thinking which leads into excellent posts such as this. Because what I think this post is all about is ask how do we mould things, what tools are there currently in the game which allow us to mould things?  I suspect what is going to happen is that the initial energy around PP will die down as people realise we will not be planting a flag in planet Earth by the end of the year. I hope personally that leads to a period of experimentation. It may be the case that ALD has made mistakes with particular systems they may not have. But as I see things the advantage of a system mistake is it isn’t seen as being precious and as such is open to being experimented upon with limited consequences. Personally I don’t have the answers to questions like the one raised in the OP but I don’t think that matters, what matters is that people are able to generate the questions and hopefully set up the experiments to examine those questions. But to do that maybe a transition of thinking “hey we are the big guys” needs to be put to one side in favour of “hey we are the really little guys” because maybe the really little actions are the thing which creates big outcomes in the long term. Of course the game or at least PP might well be crap and not complex at all and that Frontier simply dragged someone off the street and said come up with the underlying matrix for this layer of the game and this was the first thing they thought of or the best they could do. What do you think?  In response to the OP I know if I take a side in a conflict zone I can change the balance there it has to get resolved one way or the other. That has an effect on the economy it alters my trade routes when a conflict is up in a system for a period. The question I have asked myself is why wouldn’t the GDP (CC) in effect of the system alter it’s not difficult to factor that into the matrix is it, as a developer it kind of seems obvious to do so. So I suspect it would be there, just no one has tested it. And what probably stops there being a very obvious outcome is someone wins the war. But is the conflicts were extended over a longer period of time would things be more obvious.  So either a scenario will just come along and then some keeping tabs will shout out “hey system xxxx has dropped three CC why?” And all anyone can think of is that there has been a big conflict there over the past few days, or an experiment is created when an opportunity arises to try and create an anticipated result. We learn in many different ways and I believe there are lots of things about PP which we could learn and most experts agree that experiential learning is the most productive form. And that means trying different things. And one of the things I believe which will limit learning about PP is creating an overarching model or theory where the common belief is that a single ideology has to be applied over for example all ALD space. Now you might get very lucky and get it right first time but if you get it wrong that’s a hell of a lot of systems to get it wrong in. Maybe the intelligent thing would be to section up the ALD power system and assign areas to your sub-groups and give them the tasks of experimenting with different ideas for a period. And here is ‘one’ idea for maybe ‘one’ system where members from the designated sub-group engages in illegal activity with the intention of significantly reducing the CC of the system. And if it works you then feed that into big picture thinking and say we have a tool here where does it need to be applied in moulding particular systems in line with our long term aims."

If anything, this was just dumb kids screwing around. If this was an attack, it would have been far more effective to have planted misinformation resulting in us wasting our time.

EliteLavigny,3bn3kk,SpaceGameJunkie,2,Tue Jun 30 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"That has been pro/con analyzed to death. Most player groups do have a private forum room where they can discuss private matters.

Recommend the time be adjusted to something like every 4 hours (6 emails a day). Better solution would be to backup to one of the mod's Google Drive. Anyone having experience with Google App Script?

The cheapest method is to log into the game when you have things to do and pop back every thirty minutes to claim your allowance.  Then when you can really sit down to play for a few hours your hold is full and you can deliver that first.  I get 25t per 30 mins at Rank 4 so it cost me 1.25m for this load.

EliteLavigny,3bm5er,LancsPilot,3,Tue Jun 30 09:45:20 2015 UTC,"Hi Mike, welcome to the ALD Subreddit and happy birthday.  I'll try and address your concerns in the order you raised them, sorry if that turns out to be a bit disordered but you had quite a few points and I don't want to miss any.  You should play the game the way you and your son want to, you paid your money and you get ot do whatever you like within the rules, you might do things that will annoy other people, like piracy, or preparing systems that don't match what the majority of the subreddit thinks are good choices.  Thats the nature of both the game and human nature.  You raised a few points about 'the people putting themselves in the foreground, issuing orders and if they know how Powerplay works.  I'm confident that the mods here, who are giving up their time voluntarily, understand Powerplay as well as anyone and are giving us some much needed leadership and direction.  I don't always agree with them but thier 'orders' are really only suggestions based on what they observe as the best course of action for our faction and what the majority of out pilots want.  With regard to Cockaigne, the nature of 'merit grinders' is that they generally don't come to this subreddit, or the Frontier forum and simply target the most convenient preparation system, normally this is whichever system from the Preparation List in game is closest to their current position.  This results in some systems getting to the top of the prep list despite their being pretty negative, we've had systems that make a loss, systems that risk causing a war with our allies and systems that we just have no explanation why anyone would want to prepare them.  This causes frustration and our inability to explain to this silent majority (who are also often in solo for the same reasons you are) makes matters worse.  If we could discuss why preparing Sytems XYZ was a bad idea and why we woul drather you prepped System ABC i'm sure most would accept it and our factions would grow safely and succeed.  The PP system has a built in sustainability, Powers have a soft cap of the total number of systems that can be controlled before upkeep costs become too great to pay which will result in a fluid border as systems fall in and out of control.  Its important to us that the systems we lose are the ones that are expansive but without value (strategic or tactical) not the ones with low costs and good value (such as trade routes, positioning or resources).  You mentioned that you feel the mods here haven't accepted that they have made a mistake in understanding how Powerplay works and I think you're wrong in that.  I think our team has been very quick to realise what is happening and has put a new plan into place very quickly.  If we do a lot of backslapping its because we are enthusiastic about our faction, proud to have good people working with us and of the success we have had and expect to see in future cycles.  I agree with you, I don't think Powerplay is broken, it has its issues and I think many complaints about it are borne out of a genuaine love for the game.  I would personally prefer to see more contructive critism of its faults with proposed solutions though and an avoidance of complaints caused by frustration.  I think we do appreciate what a powerful effect independant pilots can have on the faction, in some cases this is positive and they come in like the cavalry to save a system we're fighting over and at others they, if you'll excuse the vulgarity, piss in our soup.  The fact we have no way to talk to them is what causes our frustration.  We are present on most forums, here, at Frontier and even on Steam but there are still a significant majority who we can't reach, setting them goals would be futile if they never see them.  I don't think our faction is at any greater risk of losing players than any other, quite the opposite in fact, this group is not about telling you how to play but to give everyone a direction when they want it, not everyone will follow the suggestions our mods present, but they consider what will be good for the faction and what the majority of pilots want before they present them.  Finally, I'm sure your son will be very welcome to join a wing, he doesn't need to earn a particular number of points to do so, in fact my kids put my combat skills to shame and they're always welcome to fly on my wing, as would yours."
EliteLavigny,3bm5er,DMHawker,2,Tue Jun 30 11:57:07 2015 UTC,"Just a response quick as I have basically had my say and it is for others to have theirs.  What interested me was that not one merit was dropped in Cockaigne for a cycle and a half other than the ones I dropped so why now over 70,000 which are not mine? Some might be because the system was eventually kind of ratified on the top of lists but half of that was put on independently before that. So I think people are looking at the forums and maybe this was all some kind of protest. What do other think?"
EliteLavigny,3bm5er,Necrophymm,3,Tue Jun 30 12:18:49 2015 UTC,"The man has good points in the OP, lets not down vote him for asking a question and making a guess.

EliteLavigny,3bm5er,McFergus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:52:24 2015 UTC,"If a system is prepped in the first hour of the cycle starting it appears on the in game map, and then players who see it will start going there if its one jump from a Contrl System. Cockaigne and Anum were two such systems this cycle.  They popped up in the first hour, and then thats it. Its position has nothing to do with being on our prep list here, or the list on the ED Forums. 25000 prep points has been enough to get prepared for us in the previous cycles, anyone who has prepped a system over that is just merit grinding. We have many unfortified systems, it would be nice if we could get some of the wasted effort into fortification.  You earn just as many merits doing that."
EliteLavigny,3bm5er,McFergus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:14:15 2015 UTC,"For the so called 'merit grinder' it isn't wasted effort, they will have their reasons behind their efforts. I agree for the power it is better if that effort were directed for most of the time at fortification the key is how to make that happen. My point is that a lot of the time looking back in the cycle threads there is little supporting narrative for such actions rather it is dominated by posts about which systems to hit next from a combat perspective, much of that narrative from people leading the efforts and directing 'orders'. I feel you need to incentivise people to grind out fortification and maybe PowerPlay/the game doesn't do that, not head towards elite status for example. So maybe something needs to be done outside of the game at the very least recognising such grinding efforts.  It needs to be remembered that everything prepped in onc cycle and fought for in a second will need to be fortified potentially many times over. So when nomination systems for prep considering ancillary trade route potential for free storage space is I believe important in partly saying to grinders ""you can still make credits over here, and be part of a collaborative effort"". If all the prep system nominations are 'all' strategic combat proposals then the grinders will go in other directions."
EliteLavigny,3bm5er,aspiringexpatriate,2,Tue Jun 30 14:11:30 2015 UTC,"I disagree that merit grinding isn't wasted effort. You only get 50 million credits for achieving rating 5, and its delayed by a week.  If a player is ""grinding merits"" for the money its very inefficient. If there are posts about combat dominating (and I'm not sure there are) its because we are a bounty hunting faction.  Most of our pledged players like combat. I've posted trade routes to most of the suggested targets, and I've personally visited them all.  I stand behind the rational for all of the proposed targets, even the ones I've disagreed with. I also believe expanding to Cockaigne is not in the interests of our Power.  It will happen, there is no stopping it, but I can't see the worth of slightly extending our ""bubble"" down there, and haven't heard anyone even talk about the system before your post here. It may not look like it, but there is a large number of our players trying to contribute to the group, and do what they believe is in the best interests of ALD.  Obviously every player has their own version of whats in ALDs best interests. If you have any systems you would like added to the discussion, here is the spreadsheet we have been using: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xiAb5Ix1GeMaWNVrRJ49IZF_543qyXNtLMsKLDL4asI/edit?pli=1#gid=0"

Granted, I decided Sibil or Limbo(sp?) were better choices at the time. Now? Maybe Sibil would still be better, I didn't check it for overhead.  Are we still unfortified in a lot of places? Cause that's going to kill us if we don't address that. I thougt we hadn't pushed fortification because everywhere but Nunus was well on its way. If that's not true, we do need to do something about it."
EliteLavigny,3bm5er,PFelite,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:55:44 2015 UTC,I'd gladly take getting folks to start working on flipping places to Patrons and Fuedals to lower the fort costs as a reward :)    Or Better yet - the FD could give us DOWN Voting or make expansions work like fortifications - so it wouldn't matter what got prepped - only the handful we actually wanted would get expanded.  Not that wishing helps anything ><  But really - now that expansion is kinda off limits - fortification (and undermining) is/are the proper way to grind out the merits.

(And FFS let the RPers ahve the own server so they can derp around in la-la land without messing everyone else up....thats the norm in the vast majority of games ><)"
EliteLavigny,3bm5er,McFergus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:26:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think its very likely it was a protest, its far more likely that independant pilots saw it at the top of the prep list and assumed it was the top priority.  Early in the cycle it only takes some systems as little as 100 points to get on the list, dropping a few thousand can indeed throw it to the top and keep it there for long enough for everyone to get onboard with it."

Just after the cycle started I grabbed 200T and dropped 50 into Vaccae, then went to Ida Dhor and dropped another 50, then 50 in Shatrites, and 50 in one last place. By the time I got back to a control system Cockaigne was number 1 with several hundred in it and that was it."
EliteLavigny,3bm5er,Necrophymm,2,Tue Jun 30 13:36:16 2015 UTC,"Hey Mike,  I'm CMDR Mozaik, I'm one of the 'council members' (aka admins) of Lavigny's Legion, we're probably the biggest ALD group right now. People like /u/DMHawker, /u/McFergus, and /u/Endincite have already given some really great replies that I agree with for the most part, but there's a few points I really want to stress.   The people in charge are not the people openly bashing other players for going against the grain. That kind of behavior should be looked down upon by everyone, and if you do see someone who should know better doing it, let us know. The narrative that exists on this subreddit and in other places isn't a narrative that was created by any one person, and there hasn't really been any concentraited effort to crush other narratives. The fact that there is one main narrative is just a result of people being people. People like things to be simple and structured generally, and the narrative needs only be just flexible and interesting enough to engage the majority of people, and thrive.  The basic reason that negative sentiment surrounds merit farmers is the assumption that they're more interested in their personal gain than they are in the best interest of the power as a whole. Because of the mechanics behind the power play bonuses, the best interest of the group serves each individual, and so the individuals (especially ones new to the game who lack the starting capital to grind themselves ahead) take merit grinders as personally attacking them. While I don't support any player publicly attacking or shaming another, It's hard to disagree with that basic assessment.   and finally this comment here...  ""Personally I then started to think about whether the people putting themselves in the foreground and issuing ‘orders’ actually knew what PowerPlay was all about""  The people putting themselves in the foreground put a lot of time and effort into understanding the powerplay mechanics and trying to educate people who didn't. If you have/had a better understanding than them, that's not something to boast about. Anyone can very easily write up a post with all the evidence they need to support their claims, it's even easier if they're actually right! You cannot take the high ground for having a better understanding than other people if you did nothing to educate them when they were trying desperately to understand and learn.  I think you believe that there is some sort of void or divide between yourself and these groups, and especially the leadership of these groups. There really really isn't. There's a lot of people involved in powerplay, if you want to be heard, sometimes you just need to shout. It's not ideal, but not even a group the size of Lavigny's Legion can change something like that. That's just how it is."
EliteLavigny,3bm5er,Endincite,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:31:32 2015 UTC,"As a side thought, what's the reddiquette on distinguishing posts? I feel like on posts like this it might come across as self-important, but at the same time I feel like given my position it's a useful tool for showing that a particular post is in line with the position/ideals/whatever of Lavigny's Legion and (as far as I can speak for them) the moderation staff of this subreddit."
EliteLavigny,3bm5er,CMDR_Bollok,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:35:47 2015 UTC,"I want to say that I am basically trying to represent the my personal thoughts and feelings, but will expand on the comment you have highlighted here.  ""Personally I then started to think about whether the people putting themselves in the foreground and issuing ‘orders’ actually knew what PowerPlay was all about""  As I said in the opening post I was expecting PP to be in beta for a lot longer than it was and so was happily going about in my own narrative or existing mode of playing when it was released with little notice (didn’t see a date in Frontiers weekly newsletter) and so I suspect like many others (independents in solo) I had to make a few decisions regarding the game. Importantly in understanding the comment I then turn after a day or two of PP to the main Frontier forum to see what was happening. What I found there was the ALD cycle thread. The point where I found this particular forum was a couple of weeks later when I realised there was a link on the cycle 4 initial post giving the ‘orders’ (not my title but the post creators) for the prep list.  Now my point here is that I suspect there are a fair few independents out there who will see information from maybe this sort of perspective and maybe little else for an initial period. My understanding today is that the posts on this forum are far more detailed, are more constructive, and the views expressed in my opinion better balanced than on the Frontier forum. But maybe the first impression is the important one. You talk about shouting but there is evidence on the Frontier threads of people for example previously being called ‘an imbecile’ for expressing a valid view and their ideas very much being discounted in my opinion. And as I said in my opening paragraph it has taken me days to come to the point of deciding to write because of an expectation of being shouted down in a similar way. I had put a message on the Frontier ALD cycle thread which simply asked what are the mid-term goals of the group, as I said to come back with a message about conquering space and taking Sol and Earth back. At that point I did think given my own understanding of PP form what I had understood from the four Frontier explanatory videos if the individuals who had responded and who were pretty prominent on that thread did have any idea as to how that could be achieved, the general sense being they would be landing on Earth and raising a flag within the year.  So all I ask is consider my position then and consider why I said;  ""Personally I then started to think about whether the people putting themselves in the foreground and issuing ‘orders’ actually knew what PowerPlay was all about""  I know the opening post was long, I apologise for that and in a lengthy post some of the context can easily get lost, however I hope you can see and understand that might be a valid position to take for an independent who isn’t glued into the forums rather they are more concerned with playing the game.  If there is something to maybe learn from this it might be to review the front line forum which might well be Frontiers own. And this is where I would return to the concept of dominant narrative. Looking through those cycle posts it is clear to me that there are people coming to the ALD group through that series of posts you can tell by their questions and where they are up to in the game. Their own narratives tend to ‘mirror’ the tone of what is going on there possibly in an attempt to try and fit in. But consider how many players look at the threads and decide to turn around and walk away, maybe none maybe quite a few and if so what type of players might they be? So what I am trying to suggest in my OP and again here is that it is possibly important to ‘break up’ the narrative from time to time maybe just once a day with a differently toned post on maybe something quite irrelevant to offer an alternative perspective. My suggestion would be that at the end of that message whatever it might be it says something along the lines of “for players new to Power Play and who are potentially interested in the long term aims of our group and who might be interested in joining please click on the following link” at which point the player is directed to a post on this forum. Now in such an instance I would have felt as might others in future that whilst a lot of the comments on the cycle post were not to my own particular tone this one might be  so let’s click and see what it is that is behind these guys. The bigger question then being what is it I might then find. That is your chance and the chance for the other people who have worked hard to set up these groups to pull me in, that is the chance for you to demonstrate you have understood the dynamics of PP and have created some mid and long term goal for the groups collective actions and it is up to me to decide whether or not to subscribe at that point.  I want everyone to understand I am not trying to have a go at people here rather I am trying to say as an independent this is how I saw things based on the evidence before me at the time and I feel many, many others might see things in a similar way. I know from experience how easy it is to get wrapped up in running a guild on World of Warcraft and in doing so how you can lose perspective on the fact there are thousands of players out there who potentially have a lot to offer your group and that you are not making contact with them in a constructive way because you tend to get surrounded by likeminded individuals saying pretty much the same thing day after day. That is a criticism of myself not of anyone in particular on here, I just want to point out it can happen. The theme in my post was ‘narrative’ and it might be felt widely that you can run things pretty successfully on a narrative of ‘we are the bounty hunters’ or something similar. And without doubt within this power that will be the dominant narrative, and I don’t have a problem with that at all. As I said in the OP personally I am not looking for a power faction whose dominant narrative aligns with my own at all for good reason. What I am searching for is a power faction where there is space for a range of supporting narratives which fall under the umbrella of the PP concept. If that is something the group would support as a concept then take the time to consider what your front line narrative looks like and whether there is that sort of space and if not how might it be created from time to time to bring people into your activities if there is a consensus for that. It’s a difficult and challenging question ‘what type of individual do we potentially need in the group and what might they currently think about us given their limited understanding of who and what we are?’  To finish with you may all feel things are fine or at least good enough and that I am a one off in respect to my views, that is fine just put my thoughts to one side and carry on as you are as a group. We have to strike a balance between playing the game and the things which surround the game and I don't want to take excessive time away from anyone's game time in creating arguments when they need not exist. Have fun but make sure you leave a star or two for me to discover out there!  Mike."

If any others for the ""new list"" are patron/feudal they could be added - but i'm starting to feel that adding things that wont hurt us is not entirely true.  We still have to fort them - so unless they are cheap and easy - its not worth ANY effort to fort systems that simply exists to not hurt. At least until the the ones that hurt us are gone. Having them already would be (VERY) useful indeed when we finally fix the mess - but in the meantime - its just more work for no gain.  If i understand correctly - when the number of sploited systems goes down as we lose systems - the value of the so-called ""null systems"" (by me :P) will actually become real profit makers - yes?

He is trying to expand to 3 new systems, they have about 40 exploited systems in them, which will cost him about 500cc in overheads. He will get an additional 280cc in Income, so will lose over 200cc from his current 770cc, taking him under 570cc. Hudson currently has 21 unfortified Control Systems. With the increase to fortifying he may not be able to fortify all of them. If we undermine Hudsons worst 7 Control Systems he should be bankrupt next cycle."

EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,Schlack,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:13:48 2015 UTC,"It will probably balance itself out. There is a soft cap on the number of systems we can manage, and to get more we will need more coordination.   We cannot grow indefinitely. Some systems will go into turmoil (supposedly the weaker ones) and will be lost, so other expansions can be done, but I doubt a power can crumble out of existence without a drawn-out battle with serious opposition."

EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,Endincite,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:34:01 2015 UTC,"Heres my current best guess for our expansion targets.  He Xingo is quite bad, but Torval prepped a system next to Priva, so its quite bad now too. The first number is the loss if it isn't fortified, the second number is if we get the Upkeep back for being fortified: Nyalayan -65, -33 Damoorai -119, -91 Tujing -60, -33 Martio -103, -79 He Xingo -172, -142 Priva -140, -114 LHS 1852 -97, -70 Biliri -100, -75 Jura -87, -63 We will lose 943cc if all of them have their fortification neutralised, or 700cc if we fortify them. This is the optimistic total, its probably a bit worse, but we may fortify more of our existing systems this cycle because our enemies will not be able to hit their undermining targets now."
EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,CMDR_Harfang,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:09:57 2015 UTC,"Those numbers are too optimistic, I used a static cost for all of them, which isn't true. This will add 141 more systems, so we will have 667 systems in total. This will have an overhead cost of 4010cc, 2046cc more than it is now. New Income will be 884cc,  so we will be -1162cc different from this cycle, not -943cc."

EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,lolailors,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"We're all with you there. It's a frustrating. It's not guaranteed that we will lose any systems, but ones with high upkeep will be the first to fall into turmoil. If we can't get it under control, we'll start losing systems in just a couple cycles."
EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,Necrophymm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:08:11 2015 UTC,"There are two types of cost: CC Upkeep and CC Overheads. You can reduce the Upkeep by fortifying, but the overheads (which are not displayed under the system properties) increase exponentially the more systems you control, so if we control a system with a lot of systems under its sphere of influence, it will increase our CC Overheads and ends up making a big loss, even if the display says the value is positive. No amount of fortifying will reduce that value.  The main problem with He Xingo and Vaka, is that they have lots of contested systems in their sphere of influence, we are not gonna get paid for them, but we will still be paying the overheads anyway."
EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,Necrophymm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:42:13 2015 UTC,Why is He Xingo that expensive? Do the contested systems count for the overhead costs?
EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,lolailors,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:08:43 2015 UTC,"from what I can tell they do. It has 9 contested systems (Vaka has 10and is worse), so that will cost us 99-162 (I used 99) in overheads just for them, plus the overheads for the actual income producing systems, and then taking away the actual income it will earn. The current income shown for it in game is calculated incorrectly.  It counts the income from the contested systems, which we will not get. The same thing happened with Vaka."
EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,willdam,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:03:49 2015 UTC,"if they are the most costly systems, shouldn't they be the ones we lose first?"
EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,Ashrack,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:19:26 2015 UTC,"They should be, but I don't know how much control we will have on what to lose.

EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,CMDR_Harfang,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:14:31 2015 UTC,"We could try NOT to fortify the ones we want to lose and see what happens?

Well, I don't know how tactical it would be if the only thing that matters in the fortification are numbers for the overall sum."
EliteLavigny,3bhlm5,lolailors,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:19:51 2015 UTC,"Thats how I hope it works. Not fortify Vaka, let it get undermined, it will then cost 60-150 more and should then be dumped.

EliteLavigny,3biqto,Nickab4,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, because as far as XBox play is concerned, the PC build has been in Gamma since November 2014 and went through fairly rigorous alpha and beta testing for 8 months prior to that.  Which is why, if there is no 'beta' notification, it might be a Gamma and they might not wipe your save.

EliteLavigny,3biqto,RemyGreaves,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:28:12 2015 UTC,"Official line is that they are looking into making it count. Wasn't gamma progress carried over to full release for PC?   At this time we are still looking into the possibility of carrying over some of your characters progress (credits, ranking) from the XBox One game preview to the final release. This is something that our development team are still discussing.  Keep in mind however, that this release is a game preview and similar to a beta, it is not always possible to continue playing on final release without a save game wipe.  All achievements earned and gamerscore added are permanent and will not be removed."
EliteLavigny,3biqto,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt that's going to happen.  Iv never heard of ANY beta carrying over data into the live release.

That could mean anything."
EliteLavigny,3biqto,RemyGreaves,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"ED PC did. Those that had bought via Kickstarter carried over and were not reset. So, it's possible."
EliteLavigny,3biqto,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:19:01 2015 UTC,"To my understanding:  XBox ED is in beta. The beta data will be wiped when you go live. When you go live, you will share the same statistics for the universe as the PC players in terms of PowerPlay, Community Goals, Economy Variation, Minor Faction Influences, etc.  However, for some reason Microsoft doesn't like having P2P set up between their consoles and the PC world. As a result, you won't be able to fly or enter into PvP combat with PC CMDRS, so you'll be isolated to only ever interact with other XBox players.  To my understanding Frontier was keen to have this restriction removed so all the players could interact as part of the same universe. Last I heard there was no indication from Microsoft that this would ever be a thing."

The only thing that hasn't really been looked at is the individual income from the exploited systems. It seems this is based on population, so extraction systems generally have no people so are worth less. Agricultural systems have more populate so earn more CC. Unless Nunus is Agricultural, and has other high population systems next to it, it of no real concern if we lose it. The CC income seems to be 4cc for low pop and 11cc for pop over 3 billion, so we can optimize our expansion more."

We should consider, though, the fact that Patreus' systems and faction benefits lend themselves very well to battling external threats. This is something that they currently can't do properly as they're too busy establishing a power base.  All bets are off however if they're foolish enough to make the area around Kamadhenu contested territory."

Our lore has also had us aligned with Patreus since the founding of the group, before anyone knew Powerplay was going to become a thing.  This and this alone is why we went for Wangal so early on (first cycle). You can look and try to find some sinister plot or strategic play but I guarantee there is none.  You can look to ""slap us down"" if you wish, but so far we have been the shield of the Empire, wedged between the Federation and the other Imperial powers, taking much of the brunt of any Federal/Independent hostility (with some welcome respite this cycle however).

The trick is to lose low CC, high upkeep/overhead outlying systems. That way, we minimise impact on weekly income and maximise impact on our overheads, and spend the least time in the red.  If we keep that up, we can keep the faction alive for longer."
EliteLavigny,3bai9f,AYKP,2,Sat Jun 27 10:01:12 2015 UTC,Except according to a few people the highest CC systems are the first to go into Turmoil and Revolt.

EliteLavigny,3bai9f,AYKP,2,Sat Jun 27 10:38:17 2015 UTC,"We would have to stop expanding, fortifying, and start undermining ourselves in those systems we want to cut.

EliteLavigny,3bai9f,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:27:58 2015 UTC,Actually - based on whats currently happening - I'd say we are getting the word out remarkably well - there are 5 systems at/under 10k we can still replace and fortification is going full bore.  Shockingly people do seem to be producing results we can work with - granted some places are still runaway wrecks - but cant reach every1 right.
EliteLavigny,3bai9f,Necrophymm,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:51:58 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'm very impressed so far. Maybe I didn't realize everyone except me who chats on here spends 50 million every cycle on power play. It's been great. We just need the full support of which strategic decision we're going with.  And maybe a list of which expansion targets we should drop if we can and which we should continue pursuing.  /u/McFergus have you looked at which expansions are better in terms of overhead and profit?
EliteLavigny,3bai9f,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:55:35 2015 UTC,"The prep list has been updated in the weekly order thread, although the formatting is a bit off.  /u/Rockser11 is probably sleeping again :) Top 4 from in game have been kept, we are waiting from Sirius to swap the system we are getting for them. The rest on the list are the least harmful to us.  I don't want to say profitable.  Hopefully we can swap some in the top 10 right now for some of these. Going forward, our capital is in the top part of our territory, which means there is a fair bit of dead wood at the bottom that can go. Personally I still want to head into the Federation, to do that we need to go in a direct line from our capital.  Pancienses is way off to the side, if we lose it we lose it, it will be a shame for all the effort that went into it. LHS 1852 goes directly from our capital to Winters borders and has an Upkeep of -27. Compare this with Aislings system Kwatsu on an upkeep of -50.

EliteLavigny,3bai9f,Rockser11,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:17:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I think when you hit this point the way to counteract the upkeep cost is to start cannibalizing your currently exploited systems. I'm not 100% sure you can actually do this though. But if so, you lose a little income for that system, and increase 'standard' upkeep (the linear cost of approx 20cc a system) but you'll lose that system's contribution to upkeep (which rises as a cubic). So you should actually make a saving this way.  The other option would be to aggressively expand towards other powers to throw systems into a contested state - I guess they don't contribute to upkeep? That could keep upkeep a little lower, and other powers at a disadvantage.  It'll be interesting to see how it pans out"
EliteLavigny,3bai9f,Cap_Dark_Jew,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:44:27 2015 UTC,"We don't know if contested systems contribute to overhead yet. I haven't finished counting our exploited and contested systems by hand.  There is even a chance that unihabited systems that do not appear on the power play map at all, let alone as exploited, are still contributing to overhead.  So someone has to count every single one of our exploited systems by hand. I've volunteered, but I've only covered 3 control systems and 22 exploited systems do far.  Oh, and we don't know for sure if shared exploited systems count once or twice towards overhead."

I tried counting our exploited systems and I came up with a number close to the first tab on the Powers UI. The number on the ""stats"" tab though is higher, and is the one used for the overhead cost calculation. When you add our number of control systems to our number of exploited systems its still a bit short.  I think this is the contested systems, and might even be overlapping exploited systems being counted twice. I looked at the utopian numbers because they were smaller, and if I remember correctly it was 110 on the first tab, 121 on the second and he has 11 control systems.  He has no contested systems (that I could see on the map)"
EliteLavigny,3bai9f,McFergus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"If exploited systems that are shared are counted twice, doubling up control systems in dead space within our bubble will not help overhead. At all."

We will have systems that bounce back and forth between factions from cycle to cycle, but I see no reason any faction at the maximum size should collapse.  Our efforts should be to identify the best systems to expand to in terms of most profitable after upkeep costs are considered so we can maximise the effective number of systems we control.  Hudson has reached this limit, I think they could have more systems if they hadn't expanded into some very expensive systems though.

However, slowing down expansion doesn't mean the work is done. We need to consider planning and implementing our undermining efforts (and quit wasting time with these ""Embassies"" too). Time to start crunching numbers on other powers and seeing where we can hit them hard and keep them down.   We're already doing well against the President and Shadow President, but we're missing systems for undermining. Are the ones where we're succeeding intentional or just where people happened to focus?"

EliteLavigny,3b9hnm,Velotican,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:29:05 2015 UTC,"What they're doing is changing the scales so that the smaller empires have a chance to compete with the big ones. It's a genuine design concern, because if one power becomes too dominant then there will be a bias for players to all defect to be part of that power... And then there's no competition.  The overheads seem to be the method they have used to address this problem, giving each power a declining growth curve.  The reason it feels jarring is twofold:  1) We've hit the ceiling really early (so did Hudson). 2) The 'true cost' of each system isn't clearly communicated.  I agree that this feels like a clumsy way to solve the 'give smaller powers a chance' issue. However, I can't personally think of a better way of doing it, with the exception of having the true cost communicated to the players.  If they included 'Estimated Overhead Contribution' during the preparation phase then that would go a long way to smoothing out that particular mechanic."
EliteLavigny,3b9hnm,Necrophymm,5,Sun Jun 28 22:36:59 2015 UTC,"So it looks like, if I'm understanding you correctly, not only is stagnation the optimal tactic for a large power as I suspected a few days ago, the Powerplay system explicitly forces you into either stagnation or turmoil after you reach a certain size.  Hypothetically, then, wouldn't the most sensible option be to stabilise the power with wise strategic system choices whilst gradually nudging our CC down in a controlled manner so that eventually one cycle we find ourselves neither expanding nor able to prepare any new systems that cycle, and switch to mass fortification exclusively.  In other words, we need to put our space into ""Park"" soon rather than crash it face-first into the building."
EliteLavigny,3b9hnm,Necrophymm,2,Sat Jun 27 04:01:48 2015 UTC,"sounds about right - we can nab up all these lilttle do nothing systems we are finding with little or no cost/gain to expand still - and just choose HTs and border bridgers (phear da blob~) as ""worth the cost"" expansions later on.  Is my take."
EliteLavigny,3b9hnm,DMHawker,3,Sat Jun 27 04:17:20 2015 UTC,if we loose these rediculous outpost in the far flung reaches of nowhere - like the beloved pancakes - we could expand SOOO much more at a null cost.  just dropping that 1 useless system would fund 2 weeks worth of null value (-10 to +10 net gain) systems...increasing our territory emmensly.  we could feasibly blob 1/4 the know galaxy (known - not the actual galaxy).    Whats better?  1 system in BFE costing us an arm and 2 legs or 15-20 systems worth of occupied - NEARBY DEFENDABLE - space....seems like a no-brainer.
EliteLavigny,3b9hnm,Necrophymm,2,Sat Jun 27 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't being able to expand to the highest number of systems, its being able to control the most useful ones.  Panciencis gives us a control system close to Winter's space to facilitate undermining operations.  And undermining and fortification will be the No.1 and No.2 priorities once we reach the limit of our expansion.  Having 700 systems that were cheap won't mean a thing if they all get undermined every cycle and we can't effectively undermine our opponents."

My thinking was to just get big, be safe, last forever, enjoy our bonus in as many places as possible.  But i see fault in that plan now that i slept on it...fortifying a bazillion systems would be utterly impossible - particularly since we would still have to go back to Kamadhenu and run them out to the far reaches.  Though I still support the contiguous defendable blob approach and will do nothing to help support outposting - and if possible hinder it.

However, a Vulture would greatly reduce my jump range, making Calhuacan a pain in the ass for those purposes.

So, if the maths is right, we should overall earn 3cc.  I started working on a spreadsheet detailing all of our systems and their income. Yes, even the exploited ones. Even still, the quick maths I tried didn't make it work perfectly, but I'll continue to collate all our systems incomes and which control system exploits them, just so those people who are good at maths can go in and maybe find us a better overhead formula.  So far I looked at Kamadhenu, Ugrivirii and Guathiti. iirc, Kamadhenu was earning us ~90cc every week. Since the addition of Ugrivirii and Guathiti, it only earns 64cc. However, Guatithi, which was on the list as -2cc is pulling a profit of 34cc without fortification. That is before exploited system overhead calculations are factored. I believe there are 22 systems exploited by those three systems, and turning a pre-overhead profit of 149cc before overhead costs.  Using this as an unscientific sample of our empire, with overhead at 12cc per exploited system. (Really? 12? That's insane.) Those three systems are earning -115cc. Two of those systems can be fortified, which would reduce that by 42cc, making it -73cc, if none of them are undermined to nullification. And Guathiti is one of the 'bad' systems that might not be as bad as we thought. Of course, I was using the overhead factored for 700 exploited systems. If our Power was only those 3 control bubbles, overhead would be significantly less. Non-existantly so, actually, at 0.14cc for 22 exploited systems.  I will continue to slowly compile this spreadsheet, and once I get more progress on it, I'll share it so everyone can look at it and do their own maths calculations. Pretty much, this is looking rather horrible for us in two weeks' time, just in time for the Imperial Hammer pilots to jump ship.

The current absolute facts from in game numbers only is that we have 526 exploited systems, and we have an overhead cost of 1964. Last cycle we had around 1400cc. We just expanded to 10 new control systems, one had an in game reported profit of -2, the other 9 were all positive. These 10 additional systems reduced our CC from over 1400 to 1068cc. Everything has been extrapolated from these numbers, and the numbers from the other factions. I didn't figure out the overheads formula, it was calculated before this cycle stated.  It works. I agree its madness."

EliteLavigny,3ba7hl,Endincite,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:52:01 2015 UTC,"This site might help: http://www.powerplayreport.com  I believe we were in the mid-300's last round. Roughly where Torval is now. If they score 10 expansions this round, they will join us in the Overhead crunch.   I'm pretty confident that Torval (and perhaps Aisling) will begin to feel the weight next turn. Mahon after that. This of course depends upon their expansions going as planned. Winters and Hudson are being tempered by limited expansions and canceled fortifications, so the impact of Overhead is less obvious.   At any rate, I believe turmoil is only a turn or two away for us."

EliteLavigny,3b9ozw,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Sat Jun 27 04:10:41 2015 UTC,"Well the fact we are posting our stuff publicly is just because we want you to read it. We also read your subs but I'm not fan of posting on subs of other powers, unless there is some well-founded reason to do that."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,epicusmontaigne,6,Fri Jun 26 21:16:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we have kind of been doing this for three weeks now. If you want to make it a loose organization, go ahead. McFergus and I will continue to listen as much as we have been."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,aspiringexpatriate,2,Fri Jun 26 21:55:25 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm independent of any group and have been trying as hard a possible to communicate with any and all ALD supporters :)
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,McFergus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:04:16 2015 UTC,"Independent here, keeping a close eye on this forum to help pool our efforts to the common goal (galactic overlordship).  At the moment I'm not aiming to sign to any formal grouping simply because I want the freedom to drop in / out as life dictates.   However the combat asp of freedom shall keep shuffling fortification materials to where they are needed the most."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,flyhmstr,3,Sat Jun 27 07:19:40 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel like this is already in the form of this Subreddit. I'm a freelancer that plays in base of what I can see from here. I try to give my opinion so you can know what does one of the independants think about certain matter.  What we need now is something that has been told many times: PGs need to inform their movements. Doing this makes us more organized and more capable to make good moves to keep our power standing strong. Right now I'm just following most of the suggestions that Lavigny's Legion gives... BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES DOING SO. And that's mostly the reason why I'm mostly upset with OCI, because they did something shady and they put on risk an alliance with other power where they could be able to put us alone (if they convinced Patreus' and Torval's forces to join them to crush our power) against the rest of the Galaxy.  Well, I think I just said everything I had on my mind right now.  Fly safe and fly for the Empire!"
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,I-D-A-C,3,Sat Jun 27 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of things to say not just in response to OP, but also to the discussion at large here.  What you're describing is essentially the long term goal of the Legion, it's just not fully implemented yet. The only real contact this subreddit has with the legion is that we have some members moderating it (keeping out spammers and the like), we have our weekly thread, and we use the moderation chat to discuss with some other ALD groups. This subreddit already is an independant ALD subreddit basically.  Ideally the weekly thread would have input from each player group, just most ALD player groups don't actually put time into researching systems beforehand and are seemingly happy with having the legion handle all of that work for them (although it should be noted that we've actually been outsourcing some of that legwork to volcspac and more recently and rarely some of the sirius corp guys).  In addition to this we've set up a public area and diplomat area on our forums for other groups and for what we in the legion call the ""Auxilia"" A.K.A. independent ALD supporters. In the future there will be weekly threads posted to these sections to fill a lot of the gaps that currently exist in comms.  I personally want the basic outline of the process for the legion to look something like this:   We have small groups/squadrons that people volunteer to be a member of each week that are tasked with scouting, patroling etc. From these groups and other volunteers who track the powerplay stats we pull all the information we need to make decisions. All of this information is organized into a thread in the member's area of our forums several days before cycle end and members discuss what action to take for the week. At least 24 hours before cycle end we post our plans to the subreddit for the community to debate and for other player groups to check for conflicts. The subreddit decides if they're going to back us and we engage in politics with other groups to resolve conflicts as quickly as possible.   /r/Epicusmontaigne, I'd like to sit down some time and talk to you about the details of your ideas and see if we can fold it into the process outlined above. It would be great if we can streamline the whole process."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,Necrophymm,2,Sun Jun 28 02:09:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure its needed.  We either agrree with or not the ""suggestions"" handed down to us and act to support or ignore them based on how the individual pilot feels about the suggestion.  We already have great communication from the top down.  From the bottom up I guess a spokes person or two could be useful tho...so ok."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,Necrophymm,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"ok...not ""great"" communication...but enough.  We get our suggestions - but we really should be given reasons for the suggestions.  I feel that might happen in coming weeks as we will suddenly have to explain the math and value of systems given the ""new"" info about overhead as it pertains to the sexier systems making them the duds."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,CharIieDelta,2,Fri Jun 26 22:01:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know if ""great"" communication is possible with a power the size of ALD's.  Sure ""great"" is thoroughly subjective, but ""enough"" communication is workable.  We get a suggestions thread weekly.  If I knew the suggestions took into account the aims of every player group, OR the other PG's posted their aims as well, It'd give us independents more options on what initiatives each of us individually is going to support.  Ideally, I'd like to see ""suggestions"" from OCI, EC, The toasters, et al in addition to the legion's.  Where they overlap, there's obviously common goals to work towards.  Where they don't, scrutiny is needed to ensure those are in the best interests of the power as a whole.  I understand some PG's don't want to do this because plans are super secret and drawn up in a hardened underground bunker and aren't meant to be communicated over public channels, blah blah blah.  Really?  I can open the powers menu in the game and see what's being prepped by which powers.  The super secret plans are super secret on wednesday night.  They're public knowledge by thursday afternoon.  Put them out there and let those of us that are inclined to, help you.    Barring that, A legion-provided ""suggestions"" thread that outlines ""System X to be prepped for the Corsairs"" or ""System Y expanded for OIC"" so that I know they're all communicating their goals and are in agreement would work similarly well for me.     The idea of independant group representation, while alluring, leaves me wondering...""how?""  I don't want to sound negative, there may well be a thoroughly sound option that I haven't thought of, but how does a single contact point represent my interests and all other independent interests at the same time?  Some PG's (in every power) are RP heavy and demand a higher commit level from their members.  Still others are already pretty loose agglomerations of pilots who just share a common interest.  I'm not certain if what needed is another forum or subreddit or website for yet another group, or if individual independants just need to be more proactive about joining in on the discussion boards of various groups.  Can I reach out to the Legion on their forums?  I'm pretty sure I can if I feel I need to.  Can I make my concerns known to the OCI on their forums?  I know I can now (I thought language would be a barrier, but damn, many of them speak english better than I do.)  I'm not totally convinced that another voice in the cacophony is what's needed.  Plus, Organizing the players and PG's in a group the size of ours is like herding cats in general, but a PG representing independents would be like a junior-herder trying desperately to herd a huge group of particularly obstinate cats."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,CharIieDelta,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"This is what we'd need to work out, of course. I have some ideas, and given the response here, I'll take some time this weekend to hash them out."

EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,Necrophymm,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:14:42 2015 UTC,"top down ""suggestions"" feel more like suggestions than when your suddenly a member of a group and get orders.  At least to me XD  edit - not that its a bad thing...but does kinda defeat the purpose of flying the independent flag.  Re-edit - I've personally been looking for a small group with a single achievable goal for direction myself...I just don't see this as being ...that."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,Nickab4,0,Fri Jun 26 22:17:24 2015 UTC,"But I'll upvote it anyway cause I'm not opposed to it - just opposed to joining it.  Best case scenario - more ""suggestions"" i can ignore. or not.  Worst case scenario - more crying children upset no1 is listening.  Everyone is a flower - but only a few get to be special.  Usually whoever gets there first."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,Metal_Mike,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:24:48 2015 UTC,"AILA is not for those who want the group structure, and it is certainly not for those who simply want to oppose the direction the Legion has given us, but will serve as a voice for the independents, and a central location for finding wingmen and other allies outside of the power group.   However, if that statement was to change to instead be a voice TO oppose the established leadership - or at least be there to disagree and raise enough voices to perhaps reconcider - that would be different.  I'd sure like to stop us from randomly spreading all over the galaxy haphazard like.  When all these ""outposts"" are attacked in a fashion that is more than 1 at a time - we couldn't defend them."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,PFelite,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:08:00 2015 UTC,"If people want a voice all they need is a few well placed duels, some time to prove their loyalty and that they understand how PP works. That's really all they need. There are players outside LL who have a voice."

EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,aspiringexpatriate,3,Sat Jun 27 05:30:05 2015 UTC,"If independent players form a ""formation"", wouldn't they be a group? Isn't this basically what Lavigny's Legion tries to do with players flying for Arissa?"
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"Dang, you beat me to the punch. :)  But seriously, the more player groups, the better, so long as designated leaders communicate effectively.

EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,Endincite,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:56:53 2015 UTC,This sounds like a really good idea.  I will keep my eye on this and be watching for execution from this point.

EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,SuizoES,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:05:53 2015 UTC,"Certainly a good idea. A sort of house of commons (not to suggest that there are ""commons"") or congress to represent the majority. Polls are going to have to be ongoing and frequent, if there is no hierarchy. I'm anxious to see how you accomplish this, as I'm leaning toward a more laissez-faire group idea myself."
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,FracktalZH,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:40:36 2015 UTC,"Good idea, but isn't that essentially what this subreddit is?"
EliteLavigny,3b8m2t,Necrophymm,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:43:16 2015 UTC,"This could be a good idea to meet new independent commanders and wing up for certain objectives. And since were still independent once you don't feel like flying 100ly to do something you don't have to. If well implemented it could ease communications between independent pilots who want to wing up for a certain task. As for the giving the independent pilots a voice... i don't know, i think we are to disperse to unify our voices, but maybe it would be a good platform for Legion and OCI to contact independent pilots... witch is kind of the idea of this sub-reddit? I don't know... lets see what you come up with :). Anything that eases communication is always welcome."
EliteLavigny,3b9hig,Necrophymm,3,Sat Jun 27 02:00:12 2015 UTC,"Certainly would be best to not prepare any systems this cycle. That will never happen, at this stage, as dumb as it sounds, the lower the profit the better it is for us. Systems that are in good positions are still important. Systems close to our capital are good. Vaccae might still be useful as a forward base, but its going to cost us lots.  I'll try to post some more here: http://www.reddit.com/r/EliteLavigny/comments/3b9hnm/we_need_to_change_our_preparation_strategy_we/"
EliteLavigny,3b9hig,McFergus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:15:42 2015 UTC,Indeed - but getting word out might limit the number significantly.
EliteLavigny,3b9hig,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:19:41 2015 UTC,"In other words. We are working on it. None of us had time to really look at this until now (except jgm), so we've botched this cycle's prep list again, simply because we don't want to tank our Power in two weeks' time if we can help it.  I don't even know that if we do come up with a new list, any of the groups will want to follow it. It will feel entirely unintuitive and wrong compared to how we've been working.  EDIT: You made another post! Come on!  EDIT2: Good job on it."
EliteLavigny,3b9hig,aspiringexpatriate,2,Sat Jun 27 02:19:44 2015 UTC,I'm on board - I've done the reading...that's really all it takes.  SHOW INFO - get the math out - give reasons/proof - after that intelligence kicks in and people get on board.  If we just yell a bunch of orders no one reads it.  Keep the info coming - might not do any good this week - but moving forward people will know why things changed and hopefully get onboard too - maybe we can salvage the situation and get back on top in a month.
EliteLavigny,3b9hig,CharIieDelta,2,Sat Jun 27 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"There is a point where we will retrieve so much information that it can come back to bite us in the arse, but frankly, I'd rather have the information out there for everyone, and if we can prevent over-expanding, then we can batten down the hatches and defend ourselves."
EliteLavigny,3b9hig,Endincite,2,Sat Jun 27 02:32:47 2015 UTC,"^ this.  I've been reading up and edumacating myself as well.  Sure, not everyone is going to do that, but if the lists moving forward have the numbers and the math as reasons for why specific counter-intuitive systems should be prepped then I'm sure you'll get more independents on board, and with a workable formula known, other PG's could start getting their members on board and they'll make better decisions on where they're going to focus."
EliteLavigny,3b9hig,RemyGreaves,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:20:59 2015 UTC,"I agree here. Disaster mitigation. Given the tools to not make the same mistakes again, we can bounce back from any setback almost immediately."

EliteLavigny,3b8hsy,Cadoc,0,Sat Jun 27 01:20:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see why they bothered compiling the list, and why you act like they did you a favour - since you'll fortify everything over the trigger anyway, with how many players you have."
EliteLavigny,3b8hsy,Cadoc,3,Sat Jun 27 12:13:25 2015 UTC,"I would think it's rather obvious, especially to an analyst such as yourself. They bothered compiling a list because they need to focus their efforts to be more effective. Their list also helps us focus our efforts to counter theirs. Personally, I think that's a rather large favor. It is likely our grinders will fortify our systems to the nines, but maybe not...  By the way, I appreciate your reports on PowerPlay status following each cycle. Your analysis is very enlightening. Thanks for your contribution to the community.  o7"
EliteLavigny,3b8hsy,Cadoc,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"It just struck me as kinda funny, to be honest. Surely they must all know that all of your systems will get Fortified. Though their list is very useful for undermining Torval and, especially, Patreus, who might not have the resources to shore up every single system. I love the work they did, I just thought that including Lavigny was sort of... optimistic? Maybe that's the right word to use.  In their place I would not bother with any Undermining or Opposition for Lavigny, let her expand as much as she wants, meanwhile focus on fortification and their own expansion. For merits oppose Patreus and Torval, the smaller Power, who can be harassed enough to take some pressure of the Federation. Post-trigger increase should, IMO, focus on resource management and countering the enemy in select spots - and with that in mind, trying to counter Lavigny or Aisiling is just a waste of those resources. The exception would be situations like Pancienses - strategic systems with good triggers, where dedicated, focused opposition can distract Imperial pilots and take some pressure off Federation space. We saw a substantial decrease in opposition to Hudson and Winters last cycle, as the Pancienses battle was taking place, and that's something they could feasibly capitalise on in the future.  Now that I put it that way, though, I suppose Lavigny pilots could try and take some pressure off the targeted Patreus and Torval systems, though that relies on you sticking with the (IMO rather lore-abhorrent) policy of open war with the Federation and helping out other Imperials.   By the way, I appreciate your reports on PowerPlay status following each cycle. Your analysis is very interesting. Thanks for your contribution to the community.   Thank you, I do appreciate that. I will certainly make another after this Cycle, probably with more data and less of my rambling."
EliteLavigny,3b8hsy,Cadoc,3,Sat Jun 27 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"I would disagree on a few points, though the general strategy you outline is sound. Optimally, they would let us swell like an engorged mosquito, then apply some pressure until we pop... Ok gross analogy... But you know what I mean. If we were to successfully expand into all available systems this round, it would be disastrous for us. We would see turmoil next turn (the turn after that at the latest, and with a vengeance)."
EliteLavigny,3b8hsy,Endincite,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:41:18 2015 UTC,"Eh, I disagree with myself about strategy half the time. It's doubly hard now, when we don't yet know the impact of the trigger increases, and the most important mechanic in the game - overhead - is the one that FD forgot to explain to us. For now, were I a Federation strategist, I would operate under the assumption that even if I wanted, I cannot stop any Lavigny expansions, and I shouldn't want it anyway - so let's bully the smaller Imperials instead. Perhaps eliminating Patreus could be a fine way to get some breathing space.   If we were to successfully expand into all available systems this round, it would be disastrous for us.    I wonder, do you think any of your expansions will actually fail this week? From where I'm standing that appears very, very unlikely. I suppose you might be able to convince people not to push the Damoorai expansion (though that's a tall order), the others seem to be a foregone conclusion."
EliteLavigny,3b8hsy,McFergus,2,Sat Jun 27 14:49:50 2015 UTC,"Hehe, sir, my expressed doubts were a lackluster attempt at feigned optimism. I do believe we will see turmoil next turn. Only time will tell."
EliteLavigny,3b8hsy,Cadoc,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"Tbh I wouldn't worry about turmoil too much. I mean, it'll limit or even stop your growth, but that's about it, it's not like Lavigny will collapse. I am really interested to see what will happen. Will we have a situation where your Power will have to be more focused on its own internal troubles, taking some pressure off the Federation? Or, lacking Expansions to push, will your pilots swarm over the galaxy and undermine/oppose everything to 1000% :D? I think next Cycle will be very, very interesting, at least from a meta perspective."

I've not done the maths yet, but I'm pretty sure that's not how it's going to work, but everyone thinks it is.  Guathiti might be a dud for profit, but it probably isn't one of our highest upkeep systems. Only the highest upkeep systems go first, and I don't know for sure if that is fortification upkeep, undermining upkeep, or if there is another upkeep number that isn't as easily available."
EliteLavigny,3b89ly,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:44:24 2015 UTC,aye - i am referring to upkeep duds - tho that system is a dud either way :P  but fair point - if we arent going to lose the huge profit massive overhead systems than indeed going for bust wouldnt pan out.
EliteLavigny,3b89ly,Necrophymm,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"If you look at Fergal's recent maths on overhead relates to exploitated systems, not half as much of a dud as other systems."
EliteLavigny,3b6hx5,McFergus,4,Fri Jun 26 10:53:19 2015 UTC,"That's good. Well, it's bad, but your analysis is good. :)  This also completely changes the dynamics of the prep candidate sheet that was put together last week.  Anyone interested in doing the same for our Current Control Systems?  Let's figure out the dead wood and kick them to the curb. Smaller, efficient systems suddenly make more sense over high CC."

EliteLavigny,3b6hx5,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know if systems that are exploited by two or more control systems are counted twice? Or just once?  If it is just once, we want to start cannibalising our spheres now. When you read potential profit for a system that cannibalizes, it only gives you the new profit, it doesn't factor the already exploited systems. Sure, once in control the maths on which control system brings in the profit adjusts, but the numbers should even out.  So, let's stop trying to remove Cockaigne?  I'll see if I can go through and spend a few hours doing the maths for our control systems today. See what I can pull out as systems that earn us more profit than cost us overheads. Though I think you're right and those don't exist anymore."
EliteLavigny,3b6hx5,Darshendros,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:43:10 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, should we also start looking for profitable unclaimed systems already within our borders? I've noticed Winters doing that this cycle. Wondering if it's a viable option."
EliteLavigny,3b6hx5,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:29:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely. That's one reason Cockaigne or Sibil might be good for us this cycle. Not both, of course.  In these cases the general upkeep still should be less than potential profit."

EliteLavigny,3b6hx5,Necrophymm,2,Fri Jun 26 14:21:17 2015 UTC,How did you find out how many exploited systems each has btw.  I don't see numbers anywhere - did you have to physically go over there and hover over each nearby system to see if it had a population number?
EliteLavigny,3b6hx5,rbstewart7263,2,Fri Jun 26 12:38:08 2015 UTC,"I hovered over it with the mouse and the 15ly bubble popped up, I rotated around and counted them, I might have miscounted, but I've done some more work on it in the ED forums.

EliteLavigny,3b6hx5,rbstewart7263,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:25:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sure :) Ignorance is bliss. Do you really want to know? The formula (which was posted on the ED forums before this cycle began) is: OverheadCosts = ((numberOfExploitedSystems)3 )/74000 We currently have 526 exploited systems so 526 * 526 * 526/74000= 1966cc We have 9 systems expanding to be more control systems.  This will add around 90 more exploited systems next cycle, which is 616 * 616 * 616/74000 = 3159cc. Thats 3159 - 1966 = 1193 or about 1200cc more overheads. We will earn about 600cc ""Profit"" from these 9 new control systems, at the moment we have 1068CC to spend this cycle, it will become 1068 + 600 - 1200 = 468. So we will have about 450cc to spend on preparation next cycle, There is nothing that will change this. Hours ago, the 8 systems on our in game preparation list we could afford to expand to had 106 exploited systems, and had a combined ""profit"" of 582cc. Overheads = 722 * 722 * 722/74000 = 5086cc. Thats 5086 - 3159 = 1927, another 1900cc in costs for 582cc in ""profits"", so our CC to spend in 2 cycles time will be: 450 + 582 - 1900 = -868 We will be about 800cc in deficit. I see no strategy to fix this.  We will then lose however many systems cost us 800cc and have 0CC to prepare with.  If we ever get more CC (somehow) we will bounce between prepping one system, then expanding that system, then losing one system in a 3 week cycle. TL DR; About 700 exploited systems is the maximum size we can grow to and we will go over this after next cycle."
EliteLavigny,3b6hx5,Darshendros,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:12:50 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't moderate or low profit systems that don't provide many more exploited systems help?  Cockaigne is the example you use here, and it has about 8 exploited systems iirc, so it's still too many.  I agree, that even if we do expand and cannibalise our current exploited systems, cutting down on new ones, with upkeep costs we will still probably stall out at 700, but then we'd have 700 very defendable systems."

There are plenty of people who can ferry goods to get the 100% targets, but there are a lot of systems out there to undermine.  I suggest trying to find a wing to do it with, everyone who tags the target gets the 15 merits. That effectively means every target killed counts for x wing members. You can probably interdict, tag, and kill targets faster with multiple people in a wing too. More rank 5s and more undermined systems is always a plus for us.   Edit: Also, happy cake day!"

I must admit that I was a bit upset about the He Xingo situation yesterday, but that was mostly because we expected to get the next system on our list prepared if we lost Sivara, which did not happen. Which would mean this kind of gameplay might become more common if Frontier considers losing a system on your list like that a viable strategy, instead of a bug.  I can laugh about it today though. OCI has aggressively responded to us creeping up on Kamocan and I'll come out and say it: we did not expect the Spanish Inquisition. :)  Opposing the expansion would, at this point, be more of a statement than a serious effort. The Federation is the real enemy here. I believe we have a lot to offer each other at this point in time.  Hail the Emperor."

While I hardly condone the tactics employed last round by Orden de Comandantes Imperiales to take He Xingo, I also understand how difficult it is to prevent splinter groups from taking their own objectives. Regardless of who has the system now I am not going to start attacking Imperial pilots over such a petty border dispute. The same can NOT be said for my views towards the Federation. I will continue to kill all Feds and such threats as the link below will hardly get my wing to back off. https://www.reddit.com/r/AislingDuval/comments/3b5yp1/sounti_kalana_and_kwatsu/"

EliteLavigny,3b610s,AppleBlumpkinator,5,Fri Jun 26 07:40:14 2015 UTC,"Angel here, while I'm a bit butthurt over He Xingo, I'm much more pissed at Fdevs changing the rules on us with no announcement that makes taking heavily fortified forward bases a lot more difficult.  I also understand that He Xingo wasn't all of ALD, just a small and organized part of you guys... so i'm certainly not mad at all of yall... plus with these new values for fort/undermining/expansion/opposition that Fdev so generously ejaculated on our faces... it makes it next to impossible to do anything besides prep wars between our two factions.  So, for those among us that hate the other faction, it has became pointless.  I'm honestly getting pretty tired of the game mechanics in powerplay, and losing interest fast. That being said... we are allied no matter what we say here.  The sooner we start working together 100% and get over our salty balls the better it will be for both of us. So, with that rant out of the way.  I would welcome the help of any ALD support in regards to winter's hostility.  But I'm fine either way, losing our forward bases due to Fdev's surprise mechanic changes would make it easy to shelf this game and get to the work I've been ignoring, that has been piling up since powerplay started.  TL;DR - we are allies, doesn't matter if you like it or not, that's the way it is, and I'd appreciate any help from ALD in regards to kalana and kwatsu."
EliteLavigny,3b610s,McFergus,3,Fri Jun 26 08:18:31 2015 UTC,"Last cycle we had one forward system, pancienses, that was hit very hard, and Torval had 3 forward systems, of which 2 were lost and 1 just scraped in. This cycle looks to just be two systems for Aisling, so she will face the full brunt from the Federation, in addition to that they are expanding into the nice green zone on Winters Borders that we were looking at, they are being very ambitious."

EliteLavigny,3b610s,TotesMessenger,3,Fri Jun 26 17:28:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry for my lack of clarity. Winters are treating it as if them reaching out alone created good relations, and that unfriendly acts are thus a betrayal. There was never an alliance."

EliteLavigny,3b66wr,MCMLXV,3,Fri Jun 26 08:12:49 2015 UTC,"In summary, compared to all powers, Aisling is the one to watch.  Her people are tighter knit, and smarter working. She didn't waste resources to over-fortify compared to us. And despite being a smaller power, she has similar levels of expansion and completely out-prepared us.  With our overheads this cycle, she has more CC than us and she's going to out-perform us by a bigger margin. At this rate, she is on the way to being the top power very soon.  Unless we play smarter. All of us, together. Let's not have another He Xingo. Please."
EliteLavigny,3b66wr,Cadoc,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:22:38 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting take on the data. I haven't really considered CC and overheads in my post over on /r/EliteDangerous - I was mostly concerned with PP actions and activity, and frankly, CC calculations are a bit over my head.  Personally, I am very much unsure what to think about Aisling and her powerbase. Yes, she didn't overfortify as much as some Powers - but at the same time, overfortiification seems to be, at least in part, a knee-jerk reaction to undermining, and she saw almost zero undermining.  I'm also unsure if she is actually the biggest or second biggest Power in the game. Lavigny pilots are more engaged in PvP, as a whole, and that means they're not spending as much time on PP actions, something that surely affects the numbers. However, Aisling, again, faces no hostile actions to speak of. Look how Expansion activity went up for Lavigny between cycles 2 and 3, simply because for the first time, she faced some opposition. Will Aisling's activity numbers skyrocket when she actually has some enemies? It's possible.  It seems, though, that Aisling is much more vulnerable to mass defections at end of Cycle #4 than Arissa. Aisling's appeal, mechanically, is her unique module. Arissa has an appealing unique module, but she also has the best bounty hunting bonus in the game, and she will always have the best bounty hunting bonus in the game - and seeing how BHing is the profession of choice for most players, she will probably see a steady increase in recruits, not a decline."

That aside, would I be right to say that aisling supporters might have an easier time of things as they can freight their way to success, rather than fight (apart from our preparation), which is more efficient? However, this does not forgive our profligate waste of resources when over-fortifying, or haphazard preparation."

It's clear to see that Hudson is fortifying more than Winter and Winters is doing more in the Expansion efforts.  To me, that means we are going to have to take some time to consider where our war efforts can have a higher impact on the Federation as a whole.  Do we fall against the spear of fortification, or, do we meet the enemy head on in the battfield in Aisling's territory?  Does anyone see anything different?

This may be a larger issue that isn't readily extraplotated and takes a little projection to consider.  What if, now this is a big what if.

OCI I encourage you to openly communicate with the general populace of ALD here at least on reddit and let us know where you stand with regard to your recent actions and furthermore the actions you intend to take in the future.  In essence should you not your silence will ultimately cause your faction to become an issue that not only ALD will have to deal with but the EMPIRE as a whole will have to deal with.  It is not in the best interests of both parties, who have made it clear, that they do not want a war between us(ALD and Aisling).  For Honor and Glory.  Bask in the light of His Grace.

If at times I question the wisdom of a given decision, it is usually because I was not aware of the discussion at the time. I argue in order to understand, as my education taught me.  I will say this: sometimes more explanation is needed (however brief it may be), if you desire the playerbase's support in the long term. We have given up some choice targets in the name of peace within the Empire, and I sometimes question the wisdom of that, as conflict is inevitable.  It has usually been enough to say ""we have an agreement"". But where that agreement seems heavily weighed against our best interests, some explanation would go a long way. Thus far, it seems to me, our agreements are steadily closing off avenues of advance.     I am only one. One can only ask.  Arissa Invictus"

If the majority answer yes, then little explanation is needed for such action, and support will be forthcoming. I don't think it takes much thought to understand why this would be beneficial.

EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,CharIieDelta,5,Thu Jun 25 23:21:54 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Rockser & the Legion: Bang-up job! OIC: WTF are you thinking?  No really, come let us know what you're thinking.   Like some others who have spoken up here, I have no allegiance to a player group, for reasons that are my own.  That being said, sane, rational commanders will realize that all of us working off the same page (""all of us"" in the sense of the ALD power and ""the empire"" to a greater extent) is a great benefit, so while I'm not a member of the Legion specifically, or any other PG, I saw early on in the first cycle that the legion's leadership has the powers best interests in mind.  They've been open and forthright in their dealings with their legion and indeed, with the entire ALD community at large.  In my own humble opinion, they've proven themselves to be eminently capable, knowledgeable of the subtle nuances of the powerplay mechanics, They are open and approachable, inclusive and seem to genuinely care about the power as a whole, instead of just concerning themselves solely with their own little corner of the galaxy.    I may not be in a PG, but I'm wise enough to recognize quality leadership when I see it.  The Legion, the PG's and the ALD power as a whole is fortunate to have them.  As such, insofar as they continue to publicly post their aims for each cycle, their treaties, pacts and alliances and they make sense in the broader powerplay perspective, I will continue to honour them out of respect for and in recognition of outstanding leadership.  Concerning He Xingo; The actions of one PG should not reflect on the entirety of the ALD power.  OIC's reasoning for doing what they do is their own, and if they backed out of a deal or reneged on a promise, Aisling's officials should be reaching out to them.  To expect the Legion leadership to bring to heel every PG in the power is ludicrous, especially in a power with the considerable size and capability of ALD and to hold us all accountable for their actions is wanton disregard for the large portion of the powerbase that abides by and respects the treaties.  I have no business in Xe Hingo, but should I need to go there during this cycle, I would expect the courtesy of a warning before open aggression.  I also recognize the right for aisling's supporters to ward off OIC's takeover of the system with aggressive measures, as long as it is contained within Xe Hingo."
EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,Aybkamen,9,Fri Jun 26 00:48:44 2015 UTC,"I am just one of the commanders of OCI. Not a diplomat, nor a representative, just one pilot.  It's been said in this forum that Lavigny's Legion was formed when Powerplay came, and most of you have been wandering around the Empire before joining Lavigny's Power. We don't.  Kamocan (and close systems) has been our home for a long time, to some of us since Beta. This is the place that helped us to build our fortunes, this is the place we bought and equiped our Annies and it's the place we train our recruits. Most of us learned how to trade, bounty-hunt, outfit, mine, wing, fight and PvP in those systems. It's our home, Nueva Hispania.  When Powerplay was coming, we voted and nearly all of us decided that Arissa Lavigny-Duval is the right heir to the throne and that we are loyal to her to the bone. So, when Powerplay finally came we found that not only our home was outside the boundaries of Lavigny-Duval, but also the spoiled princess was in between. We faced a dillema, abandon our home and try to find another place inside Lavigny's bubble, of stay and expand the boundaries of our power to have our home inside. We choosed to stay.  After we expanded, we stayed calm. We helped the main group preparations, expansions and fortifications although we had to move more than a hundred of Ly to do so. We spend millions of credits, and many hours helping the group because this is what we think that's our duty.  Few days ago we saw that HE XINGO is the only way to link our bubble with the main bubble. This is an opportunity we have to join with the main boundaries of our power, and without it I doubt we will ever be capable to join and will be a separated bubble forever. So we went for it and now HE XINGO is in expansion phase.  We will expand into HE XINGO, because it's our home, because it's the opportunity to join with mainland and because we are dozens of dedicated and proud warriors. We will expand and Nueva Hispania will be a peninsula instead of an island.  Don't get me wrong, this message is not to ask for help, because we think that we can do it on our own (although any one that wants to come to fight and celebrate that we are joining Nueva Hispania with the capital is very welcomed). This message is here because you were asking about motivation behind this movements, even thinking about OCI being a 5th column. We are true followers of Arissa Lavigny-Duval. HE XINGO will unite us all."
EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,DMHawker,3,Fri Jun 26 12:39:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't know any of this.  To be honest, being a hispanic outfit, I wasn't sure how of many of you spoke english, but that was as good a good a post in english as I've seen around here.  Clearly, communication should not be a problem.  I must admit, since yesterday went down, I went by your forums and found that of the few posts there regarding diplomacy, they were posted both in spanish and in english, so kudos to you guys on that.  From one pilot to another, one Commander to another, can we not both agree that having OCI in the mix with us makes us all stronger?    The veiled threat from Aislings people isn't what bothered me personally about how yesterday went down.  It was the thought that there may be a rogue PG out there, one I respected (if not totally understood) that had stopped communicating and was off doing their own thing.  They seemed fiercely loyal to ALD, yet were pushing into systems that were not in ALD's best interest in the grand scheme of things.  Between, you, Harfang and Aristodemo I've got a clearer indication of why you're doing what you're doing.    Space is kinda big.  I haven't looked at the map today, but I am certain there's more than one way to link Nueva Hispania with the rest of the bubble, even if it means we have to expand the bubble a bit in effort to do so.  Some of us independant pilots like to do system research for the next cycle's expansion.  Had we known this was an issue, we could have been working towards that a cycle ago.    The issue as I understand it now is soon going to be about overhead.  We are hurtling towards a point where our overhead is going to severely limit how much we can expand in a cycle.  The days of ten-system-expansions are going to come to an abrupt end.  This puts us all in a tight spot in the short term.  I wish there had been more open consultation with regards to this, but now that we know what's going on, I'm sincerely hoping the cooler heads around here prevail and we can all work towards an amicable solution that's not going to endanger treaties and still connect Nueva Hispania with the rest of our territory.    And for the record, while I know someone floated the idea that OCI was Aisling fifth column, I don't think too many people around here actually believed it."
EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Fri Jun 26 16:21:22 2015 UTC,"We understand how Powerplay works. First thing we did when Powerplay was launched was a survey of our zone. At that time we saw that the best options to secure our home were Kamokan (+56 cc ... and core of our home) and Lakluita (+102 cc at that time, although profit decayed later by Aisling's expansions). Our bubble's way to the capital is near completely blocked by  Aisling and Torval. One spot closed last cycle and the other one is He Xingo that although not great, it's still in positive cc's. If this window closes, we will need to do a quite big detour that will contain low budget systems and high budget systems that will bother Aisling and Torval.  This is the best way and It's already prepared."
EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,Sanguine_Redcliffe,2,Fri Jun 26 16:45:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this post, it explains a lot of what happened and why and I think was badly needed.  If we had known this was your goal before you embarked on it we would have been happy to help.  We might have had to negotiate a system or two with Aisling or Torval to achieve it, or possibly forced them to accept our decision through prep wars if they wouldn't negotiate.   Sadly as we didn't know our prep list for last cycle ended up a mess and that hurt the faction and pissed off Aisling's pilots into the bargain, we both could have avoided this if we'd talked about it.    The situation wasn't helped I'm afraid by one of your members who made a few personal and quite offensive attacks on one of the mods.  The mod in question has stated he's not too worried about that but it isn't the kind of behaviour I want to see from my fellow ALD supporters and I'm guessing I'm not alone.  The situation also wasn't helped by me, and people like me, getting very annoyed about being made to look foolish for trying to convince Aisling's pilots that we're trustworthy and not looking to oppose them.  Finally some were pretty upset that they had sunk a lot of time and credits into controlling the bottom of the prep list only to have it tanked by our own brothers.  With all that said.  I am very pleased to see this post, especially for its reasoned and straightforward approach.  It gives me hope that we can resolve this issue and work effectively together in the future to make ALD great.  Please note, I'm not a leader of Lavigny's Legion, just a hard working Pilot in their organisation and my views are my own and not an official statement on their behalf."
EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Fri Jun 26 21:51:31 2015 UTC,"/u/Rockser11, or any others in the know, is there a thread I missed that we can refer to regarding the Imperial Summit's decisions? It may be right under my nose, but I'm about as near-sighted as they come.  Thanks for your efforts to organize and direct this cat-herding madhouse. For the most part, you and the other mods/admins have done me proud. For an ad-hoc society that didn't exist 3 weeks ago, I think we've done well as a whole.

EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,RemyGreaves,3,Thu Jun 25 22:25:59 2015 UTC,"We didn't actually end up posting anything publically after the summit, which is a shame really. What you need to understand is that the summit lasted 6 hours. When all was said and done I was exhausted, and even Lavigny's Legion didn't get the full report from me until the day after. Since then we've just been dealing with things on a case by case basis, and so haven't really thought to officially summarize the whole deal. The general idea is that the imperial factions are all now allied against the federation. If it's really important to the community though, I'll sit down for 45 minutes and draft up a basic outline of the proceedings based on what I can remember."

EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,MajorLegend,4,Fri Jun 26 06:26:02 2015 UTC,"First off, I would like to thank rockser11 and anyone involved. I always look this reddit up to see what to expand and specially prep. Now regarding your first two points I understand them and accept them, though I hate to loose an expansion opportunity. But I have a problem with your third point:  ""Lavigny's Legion will support Aisling Duval's right to warn and ask any pilot to leave"" until there I'm OK with it but the following  ""and if it becomes necessary, to shoot down any pilots in the system of He Xingo"" I could not disagree more.  For me, there is no situation that would justify what I would call blue on blue action. I'm not comfortable with it, this is, for me at least, an act of treason between Imperial brethren (talking about any AD shooting down a ALD commander). I won't go and help expand He Xingo, but i also do not tolerate any aisling pilots shooting down ALD pilots, and I don't care if there legion, OCI or independent. I know many AD pilot would rather have us take He Xingo than shot down a fellow Imperial and i commend them for that, lets hope that in every one's best interest it doesn't come to that.  Just to be clear, I'm not saying we should take He Xingo, even if it pains me to see a expansion slot wasted, what I'm saying is that I'm against hostile actions from AD towards ALD commanders as a result of this dispute. Also the condescending, down looking way that the diplomat form AD talked in this reddit sat all kinds of ways wrong with me, but I'll overlook such a personal flaw and shall concentrate on the our best interest. I see this action, off leaving He Xingo, as a favor on our part to AD and hope they will return it somehow in the future, but that's my personal view. As said before, thank you legion diplomats for being there and organizing commanders like me who are not affiliated with any commander created group. You are doing a great job, just that I needed to get this off my chest."
EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,CMDR_Bollok,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:15:01 2015 UTC,"Please understand that this was not an easy decision. No matter what we do, we're going to be getting people who disagree with us, with this decision especially. Let me be clear, we do NOT think Aisling pilots should be shooting our pilots, and we're not approving it, we're simply recognizing that they will be doing it anyways, and that we will not be sending pilots in to fight Aisling about it. I cannot tell Aisling supporters what to do. Matter of fact, I can't tell anyone outside the Legion what to do. This is an extremely unfortunate situation, and I'm as disappointed as anyone that this is necessary. We do not approve of any imperial death, especially Lavigny Pilots.  Regarding the wasting of an expansion slot, Constant 10 system expansion could potentially cause overhead to overtake profit and eventually lead to our own downfall. Slowing that expansion, when the expansion would not be beneficial to our power is potentially a good idea.   As for the AD diplomat's attitude, I completely agree he was very much out of line in his statement, and that there we're few ways he could've been less diplomatic about what he said, but we should not be judging this situation on the words of an individual, but rather the situation as a whole.  I talked with OCI earlier today, and I completely understand why OCI wants to take this system. But I can also understand why Aisling doesn't want them to take this system, He Xingo would cause 9 of Aislings systems to become contested, and cut into their CC. OCI won the prep of He Xingo fair and square, and if they win it's Expansion fairly as well, I will be among the first to congratulate them, as it will have been an impressive feat.  Hopefully this will have answered some of your questions and doubts. If there's anything I've missed, please let me know."
EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,Aybkamen,0,Fri Jun 26 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"The legion is so arrogant they think they can be openly treasonous whilst accusing others of treason. Maybe they think 5 people circlejerking here is ""player support""."
EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,CharIieDelta,2,Fri Jun 26 18:41:54 2015 UTC,"I'm currently rethinking on where i stand on the He Xingo expansion after reading a bit more, specially after what OCI had to say.  I think Legion went to far when they openly approved the killing of, not only Imperial brethren but, Imperial brethren who support the only true heir to our beloved Empire. I sincerely hope that Legion rethinks where they stand on this matter. They don't have to help OCI with He Xingo or support what they are doing, but giving green light to kill them is almost as heinous as pulling the trigger your self. An apology would also be nice, since it was a public statement on where they stand.  I understand why OCI wants to expand there, and I'm liking the idea of having a bridge from Nueva Hispania to our main ""continent"". I also see the urgency in building that bridge since Troval and AD are expanding and prepping in the vicinity, making future links even harder to get. Maybe we could exchange He Xingo for something else?  Anyway that's as far as I can judge the situation since I'm not affiliated with any of those groups. As before I will correct my standing if i see new evidence that convinces me otherwise. As of right now I'm undecided if i should help with He Xingo or not, so for now I'll keep helping with the fortifications and wait for Legion and OCI to continue with there talks.  I also hope that I didn't appear to harsh on Legion."

OCI have carved out a defined section of space for themselves and dubbed it ""New Hispaniola""   Effectively forming their own enclave.   HE Xingo is a part of it according to them therefore in their eyes, they are protecting one of their own systems from another power.   Perhaps they would be good enough to share which systems they consider to be in New Hispaniola?  Is this to be a finite area they are sworn to protect or do they plan expansion?"

EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,amarkit,2,Fri Jun 26 13:23:32 2015 UTC,"Indeed, as I understand it:  Nueva Hispania is Kamocan and the exploited systems in it's sphere of influence and now, by extension, Lakluita.  He Xingo is a way for them to connect what they consider their home to the rest of the ALD ""continent"".  None of this bothers me in the slightest, I just wish I'd known all of this sooner  :P  Indeed, if we'd all known this sooner, Xe Hingo could have been made a priority earlier, or even a negotiated settlement for it or other systems that offered better connections.  They could have just said ""screw you, we're doing our own thing"" (and indeed, it looked that way for a time) but to be that dedicated to ensuring their territory is joined with the rest of ours is pretty awesome in it's own right.  Clearly, as a power we need to work on lines of communication, but I can't fault OCI for wanting to be connected with us in a territorial sense.  To be honest, now that I know what it's about, I'm kind of leaning towards going out there and helping.  If we have to give up an equal system to aisling in trade then get it done, but lets bring OCI and the continent together and get on with the unity thing.  There are bigger fights out there.  we don't need to be at each others throats.         edit: I'm pretty sure I saw something about OCI and Nueva Hispania in the Galnet feed, so I'd say they probably have a pretty good claim to Kamocan in an official sense"

We will no shoot first, but  my advice is you get just out of our way.  ""We would also urge OCI to leave He Xingo. Unless you know something you're not telling, He Xingo has no benefit to our power.""  He Xingo is already part of our local area and pledged to our dearest Princess.

EliteLavigny,3b4d7f,willdam,8,Fri Jun 26 01:10:23 2015 UTC,"This. It's clear that OCI are acting selfishly. I don't know if the group pre-dates Power Play, but I suspect they were operating out of He Xingo before 1.3. They decided to pledge to ALD (for the bounty bonus?) and expand her into their territory, which is strategically unsound, either in ignorance, or willful disregard, of the fact that doing so is detrimental to ALD as a power overall. I think 8 of the systems in He Xingo's 15ly bubble are contested. Awful.   Other people realize this awfulness, call them out on it here, and OCI attempt to RP-splain it as ""aiding our Princess"" for ""reasons"" that they won't elaborate on. They either don't understand how PP works and are unwilling to admit their mistake, or are intentionally fifth-columning us.  I can only hope that the increases to expansion requirements this week thwart their efforts to complete the He Xingo expansion. In the prep phase, it's impossible to tell if they're just a few guys with deep pockets, or a large contingent of players. We'll see if they can grind the kills they need in crime sweeps this week."

Even the thickest brick in the house can see that is impossible with curent PP mechanics.  The other goal seems to be expand until stagnation while we also allow our natural PP adversaries to do the same despite having an advantage in numbers.

As their diplomat is on a leave of absence, he is the person anyone who wants to talk needs to talk to. Harfang himself said he was the vocal member of their radical faction."

So if he is their diplomat and is stating that they wanted He Xingo for their ""reasons"" doesn't that cause problems for the rest of us who are trying to move this machine forward toward the Feds?  How is your Faction reacting to this and being that you are acting here to tell us all what to do for the best interest of ALD as a whole, what are Lagigny's Legion doing to remedy the situation that is ultimately going to happen between us and Aisling come this next cycle when OIC decides to continue on their own ploy and not discuss anything with anyone else and cause Ailsing to begin moving into our space?

I'm sorry, but you have to realise that they simply will not cooperate on those forums as they don't trust them.

Also there had been several campaigns to ensure that we could not expand in our homeland systems, we have decided to expand on the current locations because we can and nobody wants to talk or ask us for any opinion, so we act on our own, because we can.  Being Hispanic players probably you think that we could not express or understand you in English, so please, communicate with us.  We will not follow a common strategy unless ALL ALDUVAL guilds that have to be involved in the future of our power will be there, will be heard and no matter their size their opinions will count. We believe in democracy not in Dictatorship.  The use of insults or expressions related to potential treason to our princess are out of place, we had provided more than 40.000 points of fortification last week and we had enough potential to take care of fortification, expansion and undermining, dont worry about that. we have a solid number of Rank 5 and ANACONDAS to secure any change we want, in 7 h we had injected 50.000 on He Xingo, hopefully we can put this strength in common.  Publishing our plans on Reddit is a bad idea to say the least, all plans must be internally discussed. Last but not least, we are loyal to the ALDUVAL and to an organized democratic government that we may create in common.

These were all goals set by myself.   When I started PP, I set my own goal and that supported the lore of Elite - Empire crushes Feds. No one told me the purpose of PP was to crush the Fed, it's just that was my goal. I'm just realizing ED won't let me accomplish that. That's OK.

I wasn't upset by your post and felt your comment was totally legit. We were just coming from different sides of the same street. I also don't believe PP is an end game. I do believe FD has a framework in mind and are not just throwing ideas out (as many in the ED Forums have implied). Firstly, devs aren't cheap. Nor are graphic artists, story writers, and all the other players that go into making something like PP behind the scenes. Secondly, the speed at which PP was released after Wings indicates this was planned and being developed for a while.   Looking at the scope, so far:   Game released. Single players fly around. Wings released. Groups of 4 players fly around, building on Game Release. PP released. Really, really big groups of players coordinate outside of the game, building on Wings. Next? Thargoids? Artefacts? PP enemies are forced to become allies to fight humanity's extinction, building on PP as these out of game resources are used to coordinate counter attacks?      I like the outside game connections I've made here. I jumped on PP the day it came out and joined Lavigny's Legion shortly afterwards. I've been pretty active here. I don't plan to change that. That said, it would be nice if you could suspend (take a leave of absence) your PP faction membership without resigning. Let the merits decay as per norm while in this state, and eliminate the ability to add new merits, but remove the ""Enemy"" tag so you are now neutral again and can do Rare Trading, Community Goals, Artefact hunting, etc... That, for me, would give some balance.      OK, I'm done bitching and moaning. :)"

As powers drop out new ones will take their place. A ""total win"" is a sustainable sphere of influence that maintains our #1 spot and our buffs. That means our HQ needs to be at the core. Even if there are better systems elsewhere, we need to be careful not to spread ourselves thin. Fortification will always require going back to the HQ, which means that's always where most of our forces will be (barring concentrated efforts). We may need put less energy into expansion at some point and more into undermining the expansion of other powers and make our priority simply keeping #1 in the cheapest way (CC) possible."

They will be grinding merits like they were going out of fashion and i'm sure we'll see a fairly steady rotation of some pilots for the next couple of months."

EliteLavigny,3b32vj,Sanguine_Redcliffe,2,Fri Jun 26 15:56:07 2015 UTC,"I think they let the trigger going up indefinitly to allow every CMDR to participate. It is useless but it gives merits.   And some prefers to get merits in a useless action on a nearby system than get merits, help the faction and lose time on a long trip to the edge of the Empire.  And it would be difficult to forbid that because it would not be fair to casual players. Easy merits would be reserved to hardcore gamer, grinding as soon as the cycle resets."

EliteLavigny,3b47e2,Darshendros,2,Thu Jun 25 21:19:00 2015 UTC,"True. We do understand your interest due to it being reasonably close to you - we're interested for the very same reason. In all honesty, we feel that it's more naturally a target for us than you because it's right to the side of us and for you you'd have to go around us in order to get to it... and also last week, you guys and Nyalayan, we gave over on that one even though it is rather directly beneath us and we want to push south so that we don't have any disputes - as a result the feeling over here is sort of that we've shown some goodwill and kind of want some goodwill back. But of course, we can talk about it."
EliteLavigny,3b47e2,probablyathrowaway92,2,Thu Jun 25 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"I've contacted the player group Emperor's Grace who support Patreus. Specifically CMDR Judoh. Patreus supporters aren't the only ones that have been showing good will, we have a list of systems that we agreed not to expand into with them at the Imperial Conclave, and we asked nothing in return for it.  Caria is not on this list. It's unfortunate that we couldn't work out this issue before the cycle end, but now that we haven't, and considering our presence in the system almost an hour before yours, it's not something that we can give up on. I've been assured by Emperor's Grace that they will be stepping down from Caria and that they will encourage their fellow Patreus supporters to do so as well. The Legion greatly appreciates this friendly gesture."
EliteLavigny,3b47e2,probablyathrowaway92,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"Emperor's Grace - whilst they are friendly to and affiliated with Patreus, they are interested in doing their own thing (maybe becoming a Power, although obviously that's way off) - and their list was not our list. It's unfortunate that this has happened but it seems we've all had a bit of a misunderstanding, and hence this is how Caria has come up this cycle as the hot spot. Some of ours wanted to point out that Patreus forces put the first few hundred Prep into the system, not ALD forces, however I suppose that's a moot point.  We would like you to issue a directive to stop Prepping Cockaigne. We're not hostile against ALD but if we see another rogue commanders incident like Aisling saw in He Xingo then we will be taking the same action as Aisling is. We want Caria if Cockaigne continues to be Prepped."

Like your commander McFergus, I do not hail from any particular player group within Patreus' power, rather my dedication and organisational skills have catapulted me into a position where others listen to what I have to say. There's also been some discussion about having an independent commander not affiliated with any of the player groups as our overall spokesperson and director, meaning myself - which I must say I find flattering, though as of yet we've been too busy to decide anything on that front and I do not take that title unless/until such time as it is agreed upon."

Though frankly I don't think the folks on your subreddit would like it much if I just took the word of every guy who claims to speak for them, especially without any clear indications that they want him to.  If you actually want your subreddit to be represented in any meaningful way, you need to get organized and officially pick some people I (and the rest of the community) can talk to. No one wants to be dealing with a situation where you have 5 different guys 'representing' your reddit and they're all saying different things. It's even worse if none of those guys can actually get the message out to the rest of the community.  I'm hoping you can see where I'm coming from here."

Just a few minutes spent on doing your homework and you would know the person you're striking a conversation with organised two most recent cycles alone, helped with those before, and is well regarded among Patreus pledgers on our subreddit. Not to mention other Elite-related activities, like working with the GalNet.  Instead, you chose to approach from a questionable high-ground of ""I don't know who you are"". Rather smug of you."
EliteLavigny,3b47e2,sovereignsc,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:26:55 2015 UTC,"I spent a bit more than a few minutes 'doing my homework'. I saw that Bangfish and EmperorSly were the moderators on your subreddit. I saw no posts in Eleshenar's history about him officially representing anyone.   I'm almost offended, I don't even have time to play this game anymore, I spend most of my time dealing with stupid shit on reddit and the rest of my time trying to convince the other big imperial groups not to blow each other's heads off. Did you know the Imperial Conclave that EIC hosted (the one where EG were the only Patreus representatives), lasted 6 hours? 6 hours of talking on teamspeak, on a saturday. Please, don't talk to me about homework!  And you know honestly, your subreddit alone doesn't have the numbers or the financial power in game to attack or even to oppose any of the other powers effectively. I mean no offense by that, it's just statistics. You, meaning the group of people pledged to Patreus, need to get organized properly if you want anyone to take you seriously. I say this out of genuine concern. If you are as poorly represented amongst the major imperial powers as I think you are, and if you are targeted by just about any power other than Sirius Corp or Antal's Technocult, you will not be able to fight them off, and no one will come to support you.  I don't have any kind of personal issue with you or Eleshenar, there's no need to be so hostile. That Patreus BASK poster you did was great, have a nice evening.  EDIT 2: Grammar."

I am not the best diplomat as I represent the more radical group inside my own guild. As an assistant in diplomacy I use to only maintain diplomatic relationships with our french Imperial brothers.  1) the OCI prepared He Xingo and we will expand it.  It's a matter we decided as a guild and we receive no orders from anybody as we are a sovereign Imperial Order abiding only the will of the Princess itself.   2)  We have no part in the Treaty of Cartoy, so we can't violate a treaty we have not ratified and we are not affected by this treaty.  3) To accuse us of lying about He Xingo is unaccurate.  When we saw the difference of points during the last cycle, we decided to stop preparing as I stated it twice in this subreddit.  Then we decided to plan a Special Ops called Operación Valkyria to get He Xingo prepared because we evaluate we had the capacity to do it, and we did it.  4) About the hostile threats of the Duvalist group, we have no intentions to attack any Imperial group, but we will defend ourselves harshly when needed.

This is in hopes that the people who do not take part in these negotiations, or strategic planning can know where everyone stands.

There are no secret forums or chat channels that we just didn't invite OIC to. I don't want to sound like the jerk in this thread, but as someone with severe insomnia and nothing better to do than read every post, I can say with some certainty that OIC failed to participate and have nobody to blame but themselves.  That being said if there are things we can do to better accommodate them, I'm all for it. But what they did was not the right way to handle the situation and we're lucky the Aisling faction gave us this very reasonable compromise."

I shouldn't care about you coming in here to say you want it, because I would let you have it.   I, nor anyone else here can explicitly control the actions of any other player. You can't do it for your faction either. A few rogue pilots did something you didn't like. What you just said here came off incredibly undiplomatic and arrogant.  I'm sure the vast majority here don't care just as much as I, but you aren't making any friends with your tone"

EliteLavigny,3b3b36,Toastarian,5,Thu Jun 25 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"After reading the the entire thread from this morning and this one, a couple things are clear to me:  -Pretending either of us can 'control' our every CMDR group is silly  -OCI are a problem for both us and Aisling because they said one thing and did another without consent or communication with any of us here  -OCI are not willing to listen to reason and actually hurt ADL's potential gain in their actions, but do not care about that or any treaties our SUBREDDITS have with each other because 'they have their reasons'  -Many members of Aisling subreddit members are too thirsty for ""war"", and I doubt those that are starting fire can be controlled by the peacekeepers there. Because thats the nature of the internet.  Because of these 4 points I feel OCI should be considered a 5th column group because they have their own intrests at heart and not ADL's. If you can find a way to shoot them and not innocent ADL supporters then GREAT! I want pics of one member inparticular meeting the cold embrace of the Black, but like many others have said here, this KoS and your tone are doing you no favors.

In all negotiations in power-play it is understood that rogue player groups cannot be controlled and are not the responsibility of the main group, nor are they protected. If you succeed in destroying them, good on you. If you attempt to take, attack or undermine any of our systems in response to your failure to defeat a small rogue player group, I (and my wing) will be forced to respond personally.

This is not a dictatorship. We are not a united military group directing the entirety of ALD's followers. At the most, this is used for guidance of the best systems to prepare/organize to further ALD's cause so that everyone's not running off and doing whatever they want. Not every group here is going to fall in line, and there is nothing we can do about it if they don't, besides harsh words and sword rattling.   So go ahead and try to enforce a ""no fly zone"" in He Xingo. You'll only be hurting yourselves in the process."

EliteLavigny,3b3b36,aspiringexpatriate,3,Thu Jun 25 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"They appeared, in the last twelve hours, to be starting to.  Now, I fear it is a lost cause. I do hope their clearer heads (and ours) prevail. There is no way we can cohesively rival our imperial rivals without unity.  Yes, it is a shame that this is apparently turning into open war, but this doesn't even seem like a betrayal to me, the more I hear about it. Yes, the Treaty of Cartoi was violated, but if I recall correctly, the purpose of the treaty was, when preparation goals conflicted, our Powers would talk to each other. Many systems in the past two weeks have been discussed and ""traded"" (as much as you can trade a system no one controls).  I don't believe at any point inthe past week did a discussion happen in regards to He Xingo and Sivara. And if you point to this subreddit and quote ""we don't want it!"" from player A and ""we stopped 48 hours ago"" from player B as evidence that no one in ALD's entire Power needed to discuss the systems in question, that isn't a failure of ""enforcing"" the Treaty of Cartoi, it is a failure of enacting it.  Taking independent pilots or even pilots from an unassociated org as the approved spokesperson for an entirely different org is silly, especially as no one has ever approved of our diplomatic channels in an organized manner. If no one discussed it, it was not acknowledged as a prep war. Then it obviously was one, and one that wasn't discussed.  This was a diplomatic and communication failure, not an open act of aggression. If you wanted the ""cease fire"" of the Treaty of Cartoi to hold, you open communication channels with those who were fighting for it, not those who don't understand what is happening.  I'm sorry, but I cannot agree with the endorsement of Aisling pilots declaring open season on Lavigny pilots."
EliteLavigny,3b3b36,aspiringexpatriate,2,Thu Jun 25 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"I understand your point of view, but let me remind you that this isn't a failure of communication on our end. It is a failure of communication between your leaders and the affiliated groups.   You believe it's a violation of the treaty and now I have reports of clear and blatant acts of piracy from your Power and your group happening in Cubeo. If anything, I can state that this was done as an act of aggression from YOUR end, but that isn't the mentality of your playerbase and mine. We believe in cooler heads and continuing our relationships. As such, this is a temporary act to prevent aggressive actions so that clearer heads and actions can take place. It isn't just us who were affected, it is also Torval and her power, since it lies within both our space.  This is not an 'Open Season' on any particular group, it is a Open Season to those whom wish to break the treaty and it's principles and ONLY in the system of He Xingo. And duly note, that it will be war, if you can't control or at the very least, communicate with one of your groups.  As seen here from the evidence below. Sort your internal problems or we will be forced to act against you. http://np.reddit.com/r/EliteLavigny/comments/3b0nx4/he_xingo_wtf/cshvnns  and here  http://www.reddit.com/r/EliteLavigny/comments/3am01p/please_stop_preparing_he_xingo/csffs0w  We will protect the treaty of Cartoi and prevent conflict from arising between Aisling and Arissa."
EliteLavigny,3b3b36,DentalATT,3,Thu Jun 25 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"No one can control any player group, so good luck with that.  Lavigny has never had an overarching diplomatic corps which was approved by everyone, we merely had a diplomatic corps that talked with other powers because no one else in our Power was talking. If anyone claimed that a diplomatic agreement with the Legion was a diplomatic agreement with Lavigny, that was misguided and obviously ill-informed.  We are hopefully currently working on it, but I'm not a point man for diplomacy, so I have no idea how that's going."
EliteLavigny,3b3b36,aspiringexpatriate,-1,Thu Jun 25 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"You might not be able to control them, but you can at least disavow them, there were people calling for war this morning in our coms because we were that annoyed, including myself. You should consider yourself lucky that there were enough level heads.  In regards to the second, how do you expect anyone to take you seriously if you can't actively negotiate for yourselves? Get your shit together, communicate with each other to prevent stuff like this happening and at least attempt diplomacy with other powers rather than being a group of individuals. This is why we have the lockdown.  I hate to seem rude, but letting one member group of your faction do whatever the hell it wants, even against an established treaty, seems like a really bad idea and a good way to piss off all your neighbours. Heck knows we have player groups in our faction that have a reason to expand against a neighbour, (e.g. the RJR in Jotunheim against Torval). but they at least know unilaterally attacking other empire factions is a bad fucking idea and don't do it."

If it were true, and I agree that there is a possibility, then it would be PURE GENIUS!  Imagine, Aisling's V Column, planted early on:   some pretend RP reasons that the cluster of systems around Kamocan right over near Aisling's sector is their traditional homelands. expanding further to He Xingo to the detriment of and against ALD majority opinion. Lose ALD 2 whole systems by said action. make it seem like ALD can't ""keep their word"" re: agreements and treaties and therefore can't be trusted. cause suspicion and a split within ALD. eg: support ""our people"" no matter what they do vs. let ""them"" string themselves we don't care. at the same time, ""piss"" Aisling's faction off. An excuse for a future aggression against ALD.   By the looks of it, this Aisling ""no fly zone"" and OCI's response of ""we don't care"", ""good luck, you'll need it"" is bound to ""escalate"" tensions.   Intentional or not, who knows, but don't the rest of us get sucked into this.

When the Feds wise up and plunge the dagger right into the middle of two of the largest Imperial Powers.

EliteLavigny,3b3b36,nisanick,8,Thu Jun 25 18:10:16 2015 UTC,"The way I see it..   The leader of the Orden de Comandantes Imperiales lied about not expanding into the system. He then aggressively instructs the system to be attacked at the last possible moment when most resistance is asleep, which is deplorable in itself. There are reports of ODI pirates attacking Cubeo and He Xingo this morning. This is a pretty blatant violation of the ceasefire treaty as is, and if I had my way we would be at war with you straight up right now if spacetexas weren't so damned reasonable.  Consider the compromise is that we are actually willing to hear out the reasons while locking down the systems, rather than just straight up assuming it was a plot to attack us by Arissa in general.   Now, we can either negotiate over this like adults, so we can avoid war, or we can just say 'you know what we cant control it everyone do what they want' and go back to having Cartoi duels every week and giving the feds opportunities to attack us further."

EliteLavigny,3b3b36,aspiringexpatriate,9,Thu Jun 25 18:38:03 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to think that anyone here can reach out and pull rank on the OCI and say, 'No, bad, you can't do that and you must stop.' and they will be forced to listen. Unfortunately, that will not be able to happen.  Just like Solo players unaffiliated with any group who don't frequent the subs, or the Xbox group that may be joining our ranks and 'helping', there are just some situations that we can't control. If the OCI decide that this is what they want to do, there isn't much that we can do to stop them. Yes, they violated the treaty, but that doesn't mean you should hold all of us responsible. Assuming that this was some master plan all along to snipe a system from Aisling is ridiculous as well. Without any sort of evidence to support that, it's just a conjecture. For all we know, they are a really good 5th column group, or have been hired by Aisling herself to attack He Xingo so there would be an excuse to start a war (not that I'm saying these are what happened, just pointing out that saying one thing is possible without anything to support it means you have to accept the rest of the crazy possibilities).  Now, by all means, if you guys want He Xingo back so bad that you're making it open season on ALD pilots in that space, fine. Go ahead, if that helps you stop the OCI in there tracks. I will just avoid that part of space for now. But a few things that you should keep in mind:   Not all people frequent the subs. Which means not everyone will know that it's not very safe to be flying out there. Meaning that there's a good chance you will be blasting random ALD pilots out of the sky who just thought they were helping out our expansion, so your revenge may be misplaced. They might not even care, and they may end up beating you. I don't know personally, but from what it sounds like OCI are pretty well organized amongst themselves, even if they aren't coordinating anything with the rest of the groups. We (I?) really don't know what their agenda is, and how they might retaliate, but making demands of us here is the wrong place to do it. Your best bet is to approach them directly about things.   And last but not least:   If things do fall through, I'd highly recommend you think carefully over starting an all out war with us. Blaming the OCI for what they did was fine, and I understand why you would feel the way you do. However, I will not stand for you throwing the entire class under the bus for the actions of one kid. Not only does that not make any sense, it's not very smart to start an all out war with the number one power with plenty of supporters who have been doing excellent at coordinating attacks and expansions thus far over one system, because (and this is not just because I'm an Arissa pilot) I don't think you guys will win.   So I'd think carefully before you come over to our sub and start pointing fingers and making demands."

EliteLavigny,3b3b36,epicusmontaigne,6,Thu Jun 25 18:55:13 2015 UTC,"I'm still having trouble figuring out how a group that never agreed to the treaty is in violation of it now.  I understand that you all appeared to believe that the Legion and the subreddit spoke for every Lavigny group. I don't know how, after Vaka happened, but it did sort of work for two weeks.  Hopefully, events like this will encourage us to sort out our own house. So far it doesn't seem very probable."
EliteLavigny,3b3b36,SaltorQC,5,Thu Jun 25 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"I believe that we should be looking to the interests of our playerbase, rather than attempting to fan the flames of internal war. Technically, this is a clear and breach of the treaty, but I believe cooler heads make better judgments and overall better decisions. We look now to not only the interests of our Party and Player base, but your Player base as well.   We are willing and giving you a chance to prevent further conflict, this lockdown would prevent conflict on a larger scale that would benefit neither of us. It is better for us to get along, than to be at one another's throats. That is my aim."
EliteLavigny,3b3b36,KaymelKan,7,Thu Jun 25 18:39:00 2015 UTC,"Some personal views on the matter:  Looking at the treaty, it seems there was an attempt to form a treaty with an entire subreddit. That... doesn't seem like it would work, this subreddit isn't a private group with strict membership, it's a open forum with a few moderators to help keep discussion from getting out of hand. A comment from an OCE member has already made it clear they didn't consider themselves represented by the subreddit mods, and don't consider themselves a party of the treaty.  I hate to say it, but the treaty wasn't made with a clear concept who the second party is, and is doomed to fail. (As if it hasn't already failed as the current situation shows it has) Aisling and Arissa groups should consider redrafting another treaty that are between player groups, that allows future player groups to sign into it, and could maybe even include terms of enforcement against other players/groups that weren't part of the treaty. The sooner the better if they want to clear up the situation."

Random ideas :   Photoshop a few medals and award them on special occasions (a special Pancienses medal for exemple). Give them a customized title off-the-record, or in your forum/subreddit, whatevs. Have them speak their opinion more when they come up with something (If they have a great idea for an operation, let them handle 80% of it for instance, or if you're not convinced, make them come up with a detailed plan and let them explain why they think it would be a good idea)   If you joined a company, and invested yourself a lot in it, how would you like to be rewarded for that investment?  Not a big boss of some community, but I had to be the Game Master in a few paperback RPG games, so when players take the initiative and come up with something awesome, or invest a lot in the game, these are good ways to thank them.  o7"

EliteLavigny,3b58lm,Sammyhain,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:54:30 2015 UTC,"Since it is impossible, only take responsibility for yourself. If you have the authority from your group, you can also take responsibility for them. That is as far as your authority extends and you should construct your communication accordingly.   Rockser does this in almost every post.   They could feel like they are spies deep behind enemy lines trying to undermine the power from within. Just because that's not my play style doesn't mean I can't see the reasons it might appeal to someone. As such, we can only try and contain the damage they are able to do.   Isnt this exactly what we have been doing? What is your point?   How, then, do we deal with this? We don't! It is all part of what makes games played socially with other people what they are supposed to be! All you can do is focus on your own (or your group's) goals.   We shouldn't communicate/debate/bargain/fight to the death the players opposing us? Ignoring people is supposed to make E:D a better, more social game?   They already have! The entire Power Play system is one giant voting system! Every time you turn in for your Power, what you are really doing is submitting your vote to the entire player base of Elite!   Powerplay isn't an election between differing philosophies, it is a system of equations. Whether or not a power is successful depends on its ability to choose profitable systems. As long as the goal of our power is to be #1, system A can be mathematically proven better than system B. I don't care if the system is pretty, or has good RES, or has sentimental value. It is a detriment to our power's success.   What this reddit should be doing is instead of posts like: ""Stop prepping XYZ! OMG! Why are you still prepping XYZ! We want it off the list!"" ""All pilots undermine Hudson and Winters!"" We should be seeing posts like:   Let me just link the last ""Stop prepping XYZ"" post.   The simple truth is that nobody has the authority to make any sort of power-wide alliance with other powers.   A treaty cannot be effective unless it is as power-wide as possible. I'm just imaging in WWII the state of California makes a peace treaty with Tokyo and then Hawaii nukes Nagasaki the next day. An action taken for/against any part of a power effects the entire power.   We actually have a very simple solution available to us which can allow us to be a ""harmonious"" community, if not exactly a ""unified"" one.   This entire post boils down to a ""Lets not fight guys, lets all be friends.""  Sammyhain, Strategist,  O7"
EliteLavigny,3b58lm,Endincite,2,Fri Jun 26 06:29:01 2015 UTC,"Rockser does this in almost every post.   Well, the post you linked to actually says ""orders"" in the title. However, I specifically pointed out that the Legion was doing a better job as of the day of posting.   Isnt this exactly what we have been doing? What is your point?   Not everyone knows what ""fifth columning"" is. I, myself, didn't know what it was before Power Play. I was providing an explanation of why someone might actually enjoy that play style and enjoy it in a capacity that actually fits within the lore of the game and not just as the abuse of a game mechanic.   We shouldn't communicate/debate/bargain/fight to the death the players opposing us? Ignoring people is supposed to make E:D a better, more social game?   I'm not saying don't communicate or debate. I'm saying just think about your phrasing. You can change the entire perception based upon your choice of words. A post with a title like, ""Weekly Orders"" has an entirely different feel than a post titled, ""Lavigny's Legion's Stance on He Xingo.""  Heck, look at some of my recent comments. By your own words this post makes me seem like a peace-loving hippy sort. In reality, I have been told I'm one of the most heartless people that most have met. I have almost zero sympathy and zero cares about what people think of me.  I'm the guy who didn't cry at his daughter's funeral. I'm the guy who, in high school, had his locker searched daily by the police because I ""fit the profile of a serial killer"" and had the misfortune to be attending high school soon after Columbine happened.  All of that info about me should serve as an example. Simply by choosing my words, I can color your perception of my ""outlook"" in a way that is completely contrary to my nature.   Powerplay isn't an election between differing philosophies, it is a system of equations. Whether or not a power is successful depends on its ability to choose profitable systems. As long as the goal of our power is to be #1, system A can be mathematically proven better than system B. I don't care if the system is pretty, or has good RES, or has sentimental value. It is a detriment to our power's success.   Yes, you don't care. But your preferred view doesn't constitute acceptance by any other person. There are many times where people will voluntarily take a loss to achieve their personal goals or for greater personal comfort. Ever buy something you didn't really need but you wanted it? You have just voluntarily taken a loss for no benefit other than you liked it. Pretty sure this applies to nearly everyone...  As to my comment about Power Play being a voting system. It most certainly is a voting system. The effect of the system is what your argument is predicated upon. And, yes, I can agree that if you're not interested in sentimentality or anything that there is, mathematically, always a ""right"" and ""wrong"" choice. But, again, my entire point repeated to the point of it being similar to ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" in Spiderman. You can only take responsibility for yourself.  In the case of He Xingo, you were ""out voted"" by OCI. Applaud their effort and realize that, if respected, they are a huge force for bettering our power... because they obviously have the dedication required to generate more output than their dissenters.  You don't have to agree with what they did. But I, for one, at least can respect it and applaud their determination in the face of vocal opposition.   Let me just link the last ""Stop prepping XYZ"" post.   Yup. As I indicated in my initial post, I specifically point out that they are doing better. In fact, I pointed out this exact post by name. I probably should have linked it, but only the title was relevant to my discussion so I did not.  However, to counter-point you... let me link some others from the not-too-distant past:   IMPORTANT - Don't waste your resources on fortifying fortified systems Another system taken by 5th Column of the Empire: Candecama He Xingo WTF?   I agree that it's not very efficient at ""improving the power"" to fortify an already fortified system. I'm willing to bet that this happens because either:   The user doesn't check before turning in to fortify. The user doesn't care about the contribution, they just want merits quickly without going outside of their comfort zone.   I'm willing to bet that a lack of education isn't the real issue here. Yet I have seen this point come up time and time again.  The post which specifically blames a ""5th column"" is clearly inflammatory. It might be a 5th column... it could just as easily be another group who just doesn't share your goals. Yes, this may mean the power takes a loss... instead of ranting about it, get in the game and do something about it instead. If you still fail, well... try harder next time. :)  The last one, regarding He Xingo, was provided as a pure counter-point to the well-constructed post that you linked. This post isn't meant to improve the communication of those who already communicate properly. It's meant to help those who do not.   A treaty cannot be effective unless it is as power-wide as possible. I'm just imaging in WWII the state of California makes a peace treaty with Tokyo and then Hawaii nukes Nagasaki the next day. An action taken for/against any part of a power effects the entire power.   Yes, this is correct. However, your example has a flaw in that all of the separate ""power factions"" have an agreed upon voice. A better example than America would be the UN. If you remember, there was quite a famous episode where the collective assembly was against a certain war without proof... but America (btw, I'm an American) went ahead and invaded anyways. Oh, and the ""proof"" we were seeking... never turned up.  Did that episode affect the entire UN? No. It affected the perception of our country. Yes, it affected each citizen of the country whether or not we agreed with the decision as well. But you could always chose to live somewhere else. Just as if you dislike what your group or your power at large is doing... you can leave. Yes, I realize there are times where your choices are constrained by various factors. I share custody of 2 of my children so even if I managed to find a job and home in Europe (where my wife and I would actually choose to live if we were free of constraint), I am too responsible a parent to leave my children until they are grown. My preference of locale is not meant as a judgement on America or Americans. I just ""feel"" that I would be happier there based upon my personal experiences. Your results may vary. :)   This entire post boils down to a ""Lets not fight guys, lets all be friends.""   Actually, the entire post boils down to: ""Don't pretend to be the boss of anyone else. Claim responsibility for yourself and your group."" I even pointed out in my conclusion that I was a broken record on that point."

Which might mean they literally have fewer people who would be capable of communicating with an English-speaking group. So if their chosen ""guy who speaks English"" happens to have too much stuff going on in real life to make a post... it's going to seem like they just dropped communication entirely when that may not be their intent.  I'm not devaluing communication. It just needs to be understood that a lack of communication is more often the rule than the exception. Do all of the solo pilots communicate here? Does every group do as much to expose their plans as the Legion does? No. They are the exception, not the rule.  You can appreciate the Legion's openness, but you should expect that most groups and individuals will want to keep their plans close to their chest instead of making them publicly available."

EliteLavigny,3b58lm,aspiringexpatriate,0,Fri Jun 26 13:52:19 2015 UTC,"This is a very excellent post. I think you are quite insightful as to the mindset of various sides parties involved in things like the He Xingo incident.   I maybe echoing your post, but I want to reiterate these points because I think they're important for everyone to at least think about.  1) Groups within powers do not represent that power diplomatically.  I love large communities, I spent most of my life in large gaming communities, and love the kind of environment that results from games where you can have diplomatic relations or war with other groups of players. However, in powerplay, everyones ""votes"" are the diplomacy. Any idea of a treaty or agreement with another group is a suggestion to the greater playerbase, but cannot be expected to be enforced. Group x didn't follow your suggestion? Maybe your suggestion was great, and you had the support of almost everyone on the subreddit - but group x still doesn't have to follow your suggestion. We can't rationally expect any treaty or agreement however popular to be held by any or all of another power's playerbase.  2) You cannot realistically ""order"" the ALD playerbase to any plans.  I'd love if we all had the same goals and could work cooperatively towards the same end. However, we're all different, and that will never change. I'm relatively new to the ALD subreddit, but I value especially the Legion's involvement in trying to improve community and help organize the playerbase. But anyone saying ""go prep these systems"" is just providing a suggestion, not an order. If people don't follow those orders, then too bad. I think there are some people who are giving those suggestions that are very well informed and the plans are well thought out. But, I have no sympathy for people who after that post ""WTF why is system x being prepped!? omg!"" - you just can't expect everyone to fall in line.  Edit: wrong word"

Torval will probably stay in #3, pending some new developments - she is the best Power in the game for traders, and more of them will surely gravitate towards her. Patreus will never get to #4 - he is rightfully despised by most of the RP crowd, he is the only Empire power with poor perks and bonuses, and he is the only Empire Power not to have a completely safe and secure home space."
EliteLavigny,3b3tiy,Cadoc,2,Fri Jun 26 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"I think Aisling's bonuses are great for traders. High supply and demand on luxury items, right? Torval is great for anyone buying metals and selling Imperial Slaves.  Honestly, I think Lavigny space is only good for selling things in. And maybe we have some good stations for machinery and technology produced by industrial systems.  While Aisling and Arissa have the largest player bases, I think the Torvaluables are the most organized player bases."
EliteLavigny,3b3tiy,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:29:36 2015 UTC,"I think Aisling's bonuses are great for traders. High supply and demand on luxury items, right? Torval is great for anyone buying metals and selling Imperial Slaves.   Metals and Imperial Slaves are THE high profit margin in Elite. Palladium and Imperial Slaves have the highest profit margin of any good. Combine that with Torval's trade profit bonus, and there's nothing like it.    Honestly, I think Lavigny space is only good for selling things in. And maybe we have some good stations for machinery and technology produced by industrial systems.   Well, that and turning in bounties, with that 20% bonus! Most players aren't traders, they're bounty hunters, so that's pretty huge.   While Aisling and Arissa have the largest player bases, I think the Torvaluables are the most organized player bases.   That's possible. The thing is, because Torval is a non-combat Power, a small number of organised players can have a much bigger impact than in combat-oriented Powers, giving more of a semblance of organisation. Personally, I regularly visit all Power subreddits, and Torval's is just sad - it's basically just EIC telling everyone what to do, low activity, and very little in way of discussion or debate. I'd rather have a less organised Power than something like that.  I have always been quite impressed with the organisation of some parts of Lavigny's playerbase. You guys make some slightly strange calls (I still maintain Pancienses benefited the Federation more than you), and of course you have so many players you can't possibly hope to herd all those cats, but those of you who do work together do a great job."
EliteLavigny,3b3tiy,Cadoc,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:55:26 2015 UTC,"That's why they're the most organized. Pretty much every player agrees to do what the top-down EIC says.

Aye, I'm still enjoying the Lavigny organization right now, which surprises me. Hopefully, we'll reach a stage where it won't be herding cats, but collaborative involvement in enjoyable strategy."

EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,McFergus,9,Thu Jun 25 00:49:37 2015 UTC,"Just read this whole thing. Ridiculous that the people, whom are extremely devoted to Elite and their groups, can't have a simple way of getting ahold of each other. Even email for goodness sake. Set a time every day that the leaders or a representative for each player group talks even to say ""no changes in the plans? Ok cool bye"" Or take 15 seconds to make an email solely for said discussion that can be forwarded to others.Then when there's no reply, you can see the timestamp showing that very thing and say ""see, how are we to be held liable when our own power will not communicate"" . Then it's not he said she said with pitiful outcomes. All that help this week that we've needed in Pancienses was ignored to grind credits in order to orchestrate this I'm assuming.   Without communication we fail. Period.   The extremely devoted members of each of our player groups won't talk with each other and are thus hostile? PP is built with this many layers intentionally to require organization &  communication. 9/10 times a suggestion that someone thinks is flawless will have a downfall they didn't catch- that's why discussion is the most important thing in powerplay. Secret plans within a sub group is the worst idea ever when you aren't communicating it to others. There's a reason 4 different powers represent the Empire- different views and tactics. That cannot also work from within the same power... We should all have the same agenda in the long run because we all pledged to the same power. If we cannot get on the same page and not stab OUR OWN MEMBERS in the back right before the cycle ends then we might as well defect tomorrow because pretty soon we'd be bigger targets then we already are to the other Empire leaders.   This shows exactly why we can't get traction and exactly why we'd be unstoppable if we did."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,Droid8Apple,6,Thu Jun 25 07:19:08 2015 UTC,"ugh... This could be unfortunate. I personally would rather stay on friendly terms with ALD (allies?), but there are definitely a few of us over in Aisling's camp that want nothing less than all out opposition war against ALD...  They seem to think giving up Tujing was terrible mistake (idk why since there's not much to expand to out that way for us anyways), and now are outraged that you ""stabbed us in the back"" by preventing us from preparing Sivara (assuming we can't retake it). However, as far as i can tell, you guys weren't trying to prep He Xingo to overtake us (and were even trying to drop it off your top 10).  I really hope it doesn't end up with hostilities between us, as i think you guys are pretty nice, and pouring tons of resources against each other into prep/expansion wars would be detrimental to both our factions (and i don't really share some of my team's optimism that we could win said wars reliably against ALD). But alas I have very little weight within Aisling's ranks as I'm just a single pilot and not part of a major unit."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,Isabelle_Montbarron,5,Thu Jun 25 03:12:57 2015 UTC,"Cartoi is still on some ALD players minds, Bellaung hasn't helped things, then Kwatsu has added to it. That said, He Xingo isn't some masterplan to pay Aisling back.  Its worth 65cc, cuts into Torvals systems, and is in an area I would call Torval/Aisling space. It kicks off a more useful system for us, and kicks off a second system because its expansion costs puts us over our limit. We lose 2 systems, and annoy Aisling and Torval. Sounds like a master plan from the Federation."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,aspiringexpatriate,3,Thu Jun 25 03:28:59 2015 UTC,"But to out prep Aisling there that would have to be over 50k, if not more. That is a lot of funds someone(s) poured into that.  Either it's a lot of really bad and confused players, or a lot of really smart 5th columns. I did mention that Priva shot up 10k within 12 hours of us saying we gave it up, and kept getting larger.  Honestly, it is looking more and more like we have some really rich and really smart 5th column contributors.  EDIT: Apparently those are gross and negligent accusations. I apologize, but the situation is very confusing."

He Xingo is a terrible system for ALD, it cost us two usefull higher income CC systems and aggravated our nearest neighbour who also happens to be both an Imperial and big enough to give us trouble.  I've worked hard to try and convince Aisling's supporters that we aren't secretly plotting against them and you've made me look like either an idiot or a liar.  Not to mention all the commanders that have sunk their credits into preparing systems on our list only to have their efforts undermined by your groups rogue actions.  If this is due to you not being able to effectively lead your group then I understand, leading a group can be like herding cats, but if its your decision then you are doing our enemies work for them despite your protestations to the contrary.

Sivara isn't on it, and it wasn't updated. Thank the gods we got Tujing on there, cause Penapasoak or whatever was nearly on their list this week.  Oh, that reminds me. If they lose Sivara, what do they have in red that they might likely get. Any chance that conflicts with something else we want?"

Conii is a system that's very close to our control systems near the bottom of the area beneath Torval space and Coreward of Aisling space."

EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,DMHawker,4,Thu Jun 25 08:55:32 2015 UTC,"Proud commander of OCI  With all due respect to all opinions,    The last two weeks of Powerplay we had been absolutely ignored by the guilds that theoretically guide de future of our power, not letting us to participate in any meeting to discuss the weekly preparation of systems. Also there had been several campaigns to ensure that we could not expand in our homeland systems, we have decided to expand on the current locations because we can and nobody wants to talk or ask us for any opinion, so we act on our own, because we can. Being Hispanic players probably you think that we could not express or understand you in English, so please, communicate with us. We will not follow a common strategy unless ALL ALDUVAL guilds that have to be involved in the future of our power will be there, will be heard and no matter their size their opinions will count. We believe in democracy not in Dictatorship. The use of insults or expressions related to potential treason to our princess are out of place, we had provided more than 40.000 points of  fortification last week and we had enough potential to take care of fortification, expansion and undermining, dont worry about that. we have a solid number of Rank 5 and ANACONDAS to secure any change we want, in 7 h we had injected 50.000 on He Xingo, hopefully we can put this strength in common. Publishing our plans on Reddit is a bad idea to say the least, all plans must be internally discussed.   Last but not least, we are loyal to the ALDUVAL and to an organized democratic government that we may create in common.  Our Diplomat name is: Aristodemo Also you may contact in game: Icaro  Our forum: www.comandantesimperiales.com  Hopefully you will consider to promote a more democratic system of decision not excluding anyone."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,CMDR_Harfang,5,Thu Jun 25 07:06:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for commenting, Commander. I hope we can try and organise some form of communication between our many orgs and independent pilots in the near future.  1) As far as I am aware, the discussions over the past three weeks were in public on both the Frontier Forums and on this sub. We had no private meetings on strategy of any note. When we kept things private, it was done for speed and by private message. That led to confusion and at least one diplomatic snafu.  2) We had not heard from your group on our public discussion forums, so for the first two weeks, I was not aware that you had intentions to expand beyond your home system.  3) If I ever ignored your communication efforts, it was because I didn't see them. Again, we need to have a system where those who can speak for their orgs and the independent pilots who go to the extra effort to contribute can easily see each others' contributions. Right now, we have half a dozen people miscommunicating across two systems and we are still missing half of our orgs.  4) Yes, we need to make a place where we can involve everyone, and another place where those secret discussions can happen amongst those who share each others trust. (And technically, we believe in Patronage and Feudalism, not Dictatorship.)  5) There are always people who say traitor before they understand something. This is the internet, after all, I think there's a rule about it. Surprising comrades and, until now, a lack of communication does encourage confusion and frustration amongst allies. Let us hope we can move past that stage now.  6) If you have a better option that remains inclusive of the community, please, let us know. This was all we had. Reddit and the ED Forums are still a great place for public declarations.  As a non-group aligned mod on this subreddit, I am unaware as to why no one from your group was invited to be a mod. I believe those who formed this sub tried to invite commanders from every group to participate.  Honestly, I wanted to reach out to Aristodemo an hour ago, but I would have had to register for your forum, which I did not do because I am not a member of any Lavigny group (and don't wish to be), and, well, I can't understand Spanish as well as I once could.  Again, thanks for this message. We will try and organise something better, but until then, we do not have any means of communicating that is not public or tied to a specific organization."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,DMHawker,3,Thu Jun 25 07:33:31 2015 UTC,"This is exactely what I feared when I proposed my Council idea. I would love to organise this, but I am limited in time and ressources right now. We absolutely NEED a private forum, where a few ambassadors of the major clans and involved players can discuss all political matters.  I tried to get in contact to you, but it is hard with the current split of players and information. If anyone can give me a (sub) forum (I already asked the legion, but didn't have enough time to contact their leaders directly.  On Xe Hingo: You let everyone in the dark about your plans. If you would have tried to tell at least a few of the organising players what you are planning, we wouldn't have tried to push so hard against it. ...

WillDam introduced himself to this forum as your diplomat.  Now you are saying it is Aristodemo who is your diplomat.  Can you clarify which person it is? It seems you speak much better English than I speak Spanish, and your webpage is in Spanish, so I would propose that you try to communicate here.

Calling one of the mods who puts a lot of effort into supporting ALD's organisation a prick and a traitor then trying to say thats justified is bullshit.  Its like a football match with our team facing Chelsea when the goalkeeper (thats you) decides to play againt Manchester United instead.  We all lose and the goalkeeper looks like an idiot.  I absolutely will judge you, by your actions and your words.  What your group has done has weakened ALD's faction, your personal and rude comments towards one of our mods are disgusting and reflect badly on our faction.  So i'll say it again.

EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,RemyGreaves,2,Thu Jun 25 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"This subreddit should be open to OCI as much as it is independent ALD pilots and the Legion. Saying ""our mod"" implies he is not also trying to serve the collective interests of OCI. That is a poor road to go down, but sadly I feel it is too late.  Earl Harfang, communicating with rival Powers is key to establishing any sort of community. If you think that is traitorous, I'm not sure if you do know the difference between rival and enemy.  And if the comment in question was ""I'll drop some palladium to help you fight the preparation"", I'm pretty sure it was a joke born of frustration.  We did lose around 40cc of potential profit and gain ~100cc of overhead costs, based on current calculations. However, we gained a lot of overhead from our other systems, and I can't accuse without doing the maths myself.  You have said repeatedly that He Xingo is a sound strategic decision. Can you tell us why you think it is? If it is part of a secret plan, could you find at least one person outside of OCI to explain the strategy?  Please?"
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,RemyGreaves,3,Thu Jun 25 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"Referring to 'our mod' was intended to reflect that the mods volunteer to work for all of us, including OCI.

For instance, I personally don't think it would be right in the real world to reduce you to a gently expanding cloud of flash fried sooty particles but I will 100% do my best to achieve that at every opportunity in game.  In the same vein, we aren't Imperials in real life, we mostly live in democratic countries and beleive thats the right way to manage a forum group as well."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,amarkit,2,Thu Jun 25 14:16:04 2015 UTC,"Why do you imagine the Empire is a Dictatorship? We have a Senate, we have long established systems of Patronage that encourage and support the best leaders from around the Empire to rise to positions of Power.  No, it is not a democracy, and to think anything in Power Play can be run democratically right now is insane.  We are failing at establishing a solid Patronage system right now."

EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,lolailors,5,Thu Jun 25 02:46:37 2015 UTC,I know exactly how to harness its power. Just announce on reddit and the ED forums not to prep a system. That seems to ensure its number 1. Our current top 3 systems are ones that we tried to get people to stop supporting.

EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,Velotican,2,Thu Jun 25 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"LHS 1852 is the most important system on the list. Its a high value Patronage system with a large station. Put the map filter to only show Patronage and Feudal (what we get bounus for) and you will see all the unclaimed ones are crap, low value, small stations. If anyone finds a half decent one add it to our preparation spreadsheet."

EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,aspiringexpatriate,2,Thu Jun 25 04:54:27 2015 UTC,I doubt it's many Aisling supporters. Undermining your own Major Faction is just too much work compared to undermining an opposing one. The systems that border Aisling are also closer to Fed space.
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,CMDR_Harfang,2,Thu Jun 25 05:18:14 2015 UTC,"no, they are not, take a look at the map."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,CMDR_Harfang,3,Thu Jun 25 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"No, they are not closer to Fed space, and that was where a lot of our negative or low supposed ""5th column"" systems sprang up over the past two weeks. At least with Vaka and He Xingo, we know who was behind those. Yab Camalo? Paraesii? Still no idea. And no, I am not accusing Aisling supporters. I think there are either unaligned people out there, or something else at work."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,aspiringexpatriate,0,Thu Jun 25 05:37:24 2015 UTC,"The feds have their hands full trying to oppose our expansions as well as Patreus and Torval's, if they were just merit farmers, they already do it in systems closer to the federation. Only Aisling supporters can undermine our systems in the south and in their border.  Now we take a system from them that is NOT even on their preparation priorities, and actually frees them to take a better one, and they are the ones outraged and crying ""treachery""? This is laughable."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,PFelite,2,Thu Jun 25 05:47:45 2015 UTC,"Technically any power can undermine any other power in any system that the other power controls, they just might have to make a few extra jumps.   As far as I'm aware we (Aisling) aren't really focusing on undermining any of the other powers, at least not in an organized fashion."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:59:47 2015 UTC,"It is not technically impossible, but its obvious by the map who was behind it, I'm not saying you openly do it, we weren't focused on taking that system either, but there will always be rogue elements in both sides.  It just surprises me to see this outrage from the Aisling camp, when the undermining is much more of a direct harm than taking a system that wasn't even on your prep list and I don't see anyone raging here. If anything, you get more benefits from this than we do, we had better systems to expand to, while you now get a higher value one than the one you lost."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,aspiringexpatriate,0,Thu Jun 25 07:17:59 2015 UTC,"Someone really wants that system for some reason. Any ideas why?  At least when I drop 900 reports on Martio to keep it in the running whilst risking pissing off the rest of my team, at least my reasons for doing so are well documented on this subreddit. (I need to get that 9MCr back now.)  Speaking of trading, our #10 system, HIP 35246: I checked it out just now to see why this system was being pushed over my choice of Martio and I'm just not seeing it, unless you really want legal access to unregulated Slaves (which we already have at another control system of ours!)."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,DMHawker,3,Thu Jun 25 01:17:09 2015 UTC,"The Orden de Comandantes Imperiales wanted it, they said they stopped prepping it.  It costs more to expand to, so we only get 9 systems not 10, and its not worth much, and its off in Torval and Aislings area. HIP 35246 was viewed as a system Torval would take if we didn't. Noone was going to take Martio from us this cycle, its nice and snug next to us.  Thats why we didn't really want it, because it would be fine to get next week. Most of the good systems have been taken now, there is much less on offer for next cycle."
EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,j4ckd4w,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess a few commanders in that group who either didn't get the memo or disagreed with it dropped the nomination bomb to secure their system of choice. This is going to continue to be an issue each week  as I myself have just demonstrated, hah.  My concern is we need to get that logistics gap in our fleet range sorted now, not later, but it's the kind of thing I can see being kicked down the road every week until it finally bites us in the ass. I'd rather avoid that, so I made my move this evening when it looked like Martio was going to get torched. Hell, it's still bothering me that we don't have reliable access to the Federal Dropship, but obviously that's a hard sell to sort out.  It's a psychological thing - our controlled space is ""safe"" to anyone pledged to AL-D, and the majority of commanders will feel more comfortable buying ships and parts in space we control. Judging from the impressive prep support for Martio this week it seems many people silently agree with me (or were just following the herd, I guess).  I know the announced treaty with Sirius Gov could lead to DB-E access, but that's dependent on another power remaining on good terms with us. My long-term goal as an independent pledge... pledgée? ...is to ensure that AL-D space is self-sufficient so that in the event we find ourselves with no allies, we're not suddenly in trouble."

Well, we've been trying for at least two weeks. We'll see if the efforts this week are actually going to help, but honestly, I doubt it.   ...is to ensure that AL-D space is self-sufficient so that in the event we find ourselves with no allies, we're not suddenly in trouble.   At this point, I'm just trying to figure out where the straw that turns the Empire against us will fall. We keep making deals and arrangements that we simply cannot control the outcome of."

EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,aspiringexpatriate,2,Thu Jun 25 04:34:41 2015 UTC,"He Xingo is unfortunate because its costs about 8cc too much, and getting pushed on the list this late in the cycle means we can't do anything to fix the other 9 systems. Thats the problem with He Xingo, not that its no a great system.  It's not like the -2 one we got last cycle."

Do you think you have any legitimacy to dictact how to serve our Dearest Princess in front of a community of more than 100 loyal Hispanic Lavignists.  No you don't.  We, the Orden de Comandantes Imperiales, decided to prepare He Xingo because we have our reasons.  When we realized there were competition from our Imperial rivals of Miss Duval, we decided to stop until the last hours.  We considered that we can succeed and we did it.  It's almost done because we focussed on it with all our power and will.  Unlike your Cartoi case, we prevailed.  It is supposed that the leaders of this forum has the will to cooperate with other groups, they pretend to, but that's a frakking lie, nobody take or show interest in our advice.  Insults have been even  written in this forum about our choices.    We are very well organized and we have our own agenda serving very well our Dearest Princess. Eventhough, we are well disposed to cooperate with other groups, and we have been supporting common objectives since the start of Power Play, but not with people that only show arrogance and autoritarism when they have no legitimate authority out of their guild.

It doesn't earn much CC and it cost too much to prepare. We will now expand to 9 systems instead of 10. The last communication from your group was you had stopped prepping it.  This is the first anyone from OCI has bothered to communicate that you are prepping it again. Your contact guy from OCI WillDam doesn't seem to communicate at all. Its 3 hours until next cycle, still waiting for your prep suggestions. Didn't hear anything from your group for this cycle, whats your suggests target? More importantly, if Willdam isn't the person to try to talk to, who is?"

EliteLavigny,3b0nx4,iamnotafederalagent,3,Thu Jun 25 07:41:01 2015 UTC,"everything we publish is public so you can comment on it   There is currently no reliable method for communication and debate amongst a Power in the game, and no way to regulate any such thing outside of the game. We have posted goals in the open because we wanted to foster a cooperative community. We thought it worked.  It failed.  As of now, I believe there are 6 groups pledged to Lavigny-Duval. We need to formulate a system so each of the 6 groups has an equal voice in grand strategy and yet can still keep their own plans secret if they choose. If anyone has been dictating, it is because we do not understand what is going on. Or why.  If what we need to do is allow for each group to submit a request for 1 or 2 Prep systems that they will take care of every week, that is workable. We just need to know in advanced before we recommend a list of systems that cause everyone to waste hard earned credits on.  We should be trying to avoid competition within our own Power. Please, we need to work together or we will lose participation. Hell, even if we don't lose participation, we will be pouring millions of credits against each other and wasting what participation we have.  We probably have 12 systems this week with over 22,000 preparation corruption reports. That is insane levels of participation. That is roughly over 100 million credits spent preparing 12 systems, and that's not counting the ones with over 50k.  We should cherish that and bring it together for common goals, not unleash it against each other."

Would love for confirmation from OCI. PM the details with the expansion cost of your target and we will keep it secret. We need to know the expansion cost so plans can be made for the other targets.

If you'd rather enjoy your monies and have fun with Power Play, there is trading and shooting to do.  Also, as we expand, we usually need research and information on new and proposed systems.

EliteLavigny,3azaic,McFergus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:06:58 2015 UTC,"I'm greatly enjoying it for PvE combat. Gimballed burst lasers on the medium hardpoints while flying in reverse can take down anything smaller, and a gimballed cannon on the large hardpoint can strip through the power plant of anything equal or bigger.  I've managed to take down NPC Pythons and Anacondas of up to 'Expert' rank one-on-one. Although in the Anaconda scenario it was admittedly a little bit touch and go when it started trying to ram me. :P  Against NPCs the firepower and flexibility is great, and the added jump range is a massive luxury.  However, the moment you get into PvP, you're pretty much screwed. A competent Viper pilot can pick you to shreds. I have very fond memories of my old Eagle - I'm pretty sure if I went back to it, I could take on a Diamondback Explorer CMDR and, with just a little luck and a good supply of chaff and shield cells, take them down. The maneuverability and speed of the DBE is just way too low for any kind of PvP combat.  I also think the Diamondback Explorer would make a really good transition ship between the Cobra and the Asp for a dedicated explorer. I started out as an explorer but got bored with it. If I were to switch back today, the Diamondback Explorer would be a perfect to use for it."

EliteLavigny,3ayng5,sariq,3,Wed Jun 24 16:28:05 2015 UTC,"a clipper isn't quite as suited for combat as a vulture is.   That I would disagree with.  You will encounter both fighting and trading crafts in a faction's control system. For example, if you take Zachary Hudson, the fighters are labelled ""Federal Agent"" and the traders ""Federal Logistics"". Ships can be anything from Sidey to (I believe) Anaconda. You'll get 15 merits and a fat bounty on your head for each kill but any faction kill in control systems count. What I mean by this is you could kill a Sirius Agent in a Hudson system and still get the credit."

EliteLavigny,3avkob,Sanguine_Redcliffe,2,Tue Jun 23 21:42:39 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think it's inevitable for maturing powers. It appears to be designed to curb runaway expansion. A way to ""trim the fat"" as high cost systems fall into turmoil. Worst case, a way for bloated powers to burn and let new ones grow from the ashes. I like the idea, but it's something we'll have to contend with."
EliteLavigny,3avkob,Ubiquitous_Che,5,Tue Jun 23 22:00:25 2015 UTC,"I think that's exactly the point.  Without a mechanic to 'punish' large empires, smaller empires will never be able to form and grow and expand.  It's basically setting us up for a situation where we need to wind up with a certain percentage of fortified, non-undermined control system so as to not fall into turmoil due to overhead costs.  Smaller powers won't have this problem to the same extent, giving them a competitive edge.  I was wondering how they'd manage making smaller empires competitive, and this fits that bill very neatly.  Whether or not it's a truly good game design will reveal itself as time progresses."

EliteLavigny,3avkob,EliteStarLicker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:24:37 2015 UTC,For the immediate future you are correct. What Velotican sees is the tipping point where addition expansion will actually trigger a period of contraction.
EliteLavigny,3avkob,NEM3S1S,2,Tue Jun 23 22:38:35 2015 UTC,"This is what I was driving at, yes - there will inevitably come a point where a power cannot expand and gain CC overall after the overhead is taken into account.  It means the prospective system's distance from HQ needs to be given greater consideration in the decision making and the upkeep costs needs to be calculated ahead of time.  As soon as someone has the bright idea to actually bother undermining us things will get ""fun"" very fast. We're already seeing our power base eroding during a cycle from undermining - if that happens en masse it'll get nasty.  It seems the optimal long-term strategy is to set up a sustainable power base that can remain stable even if every single system is paying standard upkeep costs."
EliteLavigny,3avkob,Velotican,2,Tue Jun 23 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't high profit systems be able to pay for their own upkeep and overhead(even when people start undermining all of our systems) with profit to continue to purchase expansion systems? Doesn't it boil down to choosing the most profitable systems to prepare no matter what so the Total CC available is the highest possible so we can purchase all 10 preparation systems every time(all high profit of course). Am I wrong or are the only ways to screw this up is to have a lack of communication and non-forum readers begin prepping terrible systems?  Also, is the fact that we have been benefiting greatly financially due to the lack of undermining against us going to be a good thing or a bad thing? Will this cause us to buy more that we can support or will it allow us to buy the maximum amount of systems possible per week (10) which expands us the fastest possible? If each system purchased is self sustaining even while undermining/ fortification cancels each other out (so we have to pay the upkeep) shouldn't we be fine?"
EliteLavigny,3avkob,aspiringexpatriate,2,Wed Jun 24 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"You are correct. The best way to go is to choose the most profitable systems.  We will be fine for a while, but eventually this ""Overhead"" will grow to the point that it is nigh unto impossible to sustain growth, leading to a period of retraction and stabilization. At that point it will probably stabilize into an expand and contract cycle. We've yet to see it, so it's just conjecture at the moment."
EliteLavigny,3avkob,ImperiusII,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:20:09 2015 UTC,"Well that's the whole point, we have to ensure that we only expand into systems that we can support, and not into ones that we can't."
EliteLavigny,3avkob,NEM3S1S,3,Tue Jun 23 22:40:44 2015 UTC,"That's what this whole thread is about. Eventually ""Overhead"" creates a tipping point past which no expansion can be supported."
EliteLavigny,3avkob,Cadoc,2,Tue Jun 23 22:45:47 2015 UTC,"This also means long-range expansion is extremely risky, and we're likely to see our upkeep explode next week if we take Pancienses.  It's still worth it, we just have to make sure we can handle the fortification workload and eat the system's upkeep costs, hidden or otherwise."
EliteLavigny,3avkob,NEM3S1S,2,Tue Jun 23 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"Nunus, a system that started in our control (or expansion, can't remember), is further out.  My understanding of the concept is that yes, this is a buffer to run away expansion, but it is also a mechanic for self-propagation of Powers. When control systems fall into turmoil and become uncontrolled, yes, another Power can swoop in, but I'd much rather prefer the Lore to eventually birth new Powers breaking away from the divided ones.  They've said the system is built for 20 Powers, not 10, and they didn't expect any Player driven Minor Faction to reach Power status. That tells me that they intend for some of these Power-blocs to split, collapse, and divide.  Honestly, in six months, I don't think there will be that many players pledged to Powers, but we will enjoy how differentiated the galaxy will be."

It seems to prevent a steamroller effect and send huge powers on a course back to the bottom (though they will probably find stability before then).  That's my personal conjecture. Take it with a heavy grain of salt."
EliteLavigny,3avkob,jgmcdee,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:50:23 2015 UTC,"If this is the case... is there any way to increase the CC of held systems to make the more profitable, allowing further expansion eventually, or are the CC costs pretty much set in stone, thus capping empire sizes as a certain number of systems?"
EliteLavigny,3avkob,Ant-Solo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"Why yes! As has been pointed out by several people (In other threads, not this one) if we can flip systems to Patronage or Feudal governments we will pay less upkeep, thus have better Net CC. That takes a great deal of coordinated effort doing missions for the right minor factions, but yes, it is plausible."
EliteLavigny,3avkob,Ant-Solo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:24:11 2015 UTC,"Upkeep is purely a function of distance from HQ and has nothing to do with the number or type of systems, nor the factions present.  It's possible that income might change with different governments but I haven't seen any data from people who might have looked in to this."
EliteLavigny,3avkob,jgmcdee,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:16:45 2015 UTC,"Hi, Hudson Support here * waves *  Interesting comments, I think some of you might understand it (lots of you clearly don't though).  A couple of points:   At Hudson we didn't get where we are by bad player choices. We were set on this road (I know some of you realise this), I suspect to test the turmoil system. Also, blaming Hudson for being to ""Murica, f--- yeah!"" is just ridiculous. We are enemies and this is how the galaxy is set up. We are big and Feds, we were always going to take flak. Like us, you also have plenty of CMDRs that mindlessly grind. 7000% Vs 9% fortification anyone? Also there are lots of really dreadful systems being expanded this cycle. You are about to hit the brick wall that is a cubic curve in the next couple of weeks.   I've made an educated guess at your Overheads for next week. Anyone want to guess?"
EliteLavigny,3ayesg,TzeroX,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:32:26 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take a wild guess and finger you as German? Am I correct? :) If so, you should get some of your mates together and start a German themed group. We already have 1 Spanish group, 2 French groups, and multiple English-speaking groups. It would be great to increase our diversity!  Allow me to correct a misconception. Fortification cancels out undermining, regardless of when the undermining took place. The calculations run at the end of the weekly cycle. If I'm not mistaken, every system Hudson controls has been undermined every week thus far.  You bring up a point I haven't considered before. The NPCs doing grind work... Frontier built its own 5th column! I'm not sure if the NPCs actually affect changes in PowerPlay, but I cannot confirm that they do not.  Probably the best thing we can do to hurt Hudson is deny expansions in ""Good"" systems (strong Net CC), forcing him to expand into ""Bad/Sub-Par"" systems (negative or weak Net CC). In this way, we actually accelerate the turmoil scenario for Hudson. Ironically, denying Hudson all expansion could be doing him a favor and prolong his existence. Here's why I think so.  Thanks for your thoughts! I think in a few turns we may see the effects of turmoil and loss of control in Federal space."

The point you bring up here is quite interesting, i havent thought about that yet but it makes sense, thx for the info :)  As i have the feeling you know more about PoweRPlay then me, let me ask you a question: What happens if u undermine a system and keep them from reaching the trigger to fortify ""succesfull"" Or is this irrelevant and the first fortify package that arrives cancels the undermining?  Greetings TzeroX"
EliteLavigny,3ayesg,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"Awww, I was hoping we could get a German group going too. :)  To answer your question:   If Undermining is successful (reaches the trigger for the Control System), and Fortification is unsuccessful (fails to reach the fortification trigger), then the Undermining penalties are in force.  If the opposite is true (Fortification is successful with a failed Undermining attempt) then the Fortification bonus is in force.  If both triggers are met then they neutralize one another.  Fortifying or Undermining beyond 100% of the trigger value is ineffectual.   This post and the linked articles may help you wrap your head around the PowerPlay mechanics. It's definitely something we're all still learning."
EliteLavigny,3ayesg,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"So to succeed in making a enemy system go into revolt we have to make sure that they dont scratch that fortifying trigger while we undermine it? And that for probably 4-6 systems - for 1 week... this may do need a 100men force, international ofcourse to ensure a 24/7 undermining. Maybe even more players, so players who get ""bored"" quite fast doing the same over and over can take a break doing something else.  Is there any chance to get that amount of players willing to participate?  EDIT: And thanks for the detailed answers :)"
EliteLavigny,3ayesg,Sanguine_Redcliffe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:02:07 2015 UTC,"Now you're thinking :)  The problem with that strategy is that the vast majority of players are safe and sound in Solo mode. Solo mode impacts the system the same as Open-Play. So we can't truly implement that strategy to keep them from fully Fortifying.  On top of that, we still need people to Prepare systems and Expand systems. That's were most of the action seems to take place.   For example:  Last cycle we had a Preparation surge for Pancienses (If you see references to Operation Key, that was it). This cycle we are embroiled in forcing that Expansion, with multiple powers trying to oppose us in Solo and Open modes. There's still PvP there, so if you enter the system in Open-Play, be sure you wing up or you will be at a disadvantage.  Anyway, I hope that makes sense."

EliteLavigny,3ayesg,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:31:42 2015 UTC,I don't think NPCs can or do fortify a system. I haven't seen any evidence to support the idea that NPCs are directly affecting Powerplay.

I doubt that all that fortifcation going on is done by players, it would take a imense amount of players doing that in all the controlled systems simultane! - to reach those numbers - (sure u can just be rich and waste your money delivering tons of packages at once, but still - so many systems where they have to do so)"
EliteLavigny,3ayesg,ImperiusII,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"I think what Hawker means is that while the game generates NPCs with the cargo for fortification, no one has seen any evidence that NPC cargo is counted towards PowerPlay numbers.

EliteLavigny,3axh6o,Endincite,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:33:32 2015 UTC,If you want to communicate preparation strategy then the best bet is to have someone sitting in each control system and broadcasting a message every Thursday morning with a list of preparation targets.  But them a lot of people play in group or solo so you won't catch all of them.  Instancing will also mean that others slip through the net.  But if you ask them to pass the message along you might stand a chance.  Reality though is that there's little that can be done with the game as it is as there are too many unreachable players.

EliteLavigny,3aubqu,Rockser11,3,Tue Jun 23 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"Winters is pushing into the area Z+ (up) from Calhuacan etc. There are some excellent clusters of high-CC worlds there, and I think at least partially moving that way would be best. I'm sorry I'm not ingame right now, but I'll get back to you on some targets.  We should also take note of Torval's situation this cycle. They pushed hard for forward positions (which are thus easily opposable) vs. Hudson/Winters and will probably only actually gain 1 or 2 due to fierce and ongoing expansion battles. Too much effort in the Pancienses sector could backfire in this way, leaving us with less of a gain than we want next week. I highly doubt we'd get the support we got this week for another major battle."
EliteLavigny,3aubqu,Endincite,4,Tue Jun 23 19:03:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with your first point. I can do a little research too. That was the plan last night, but I got greedy making credits instead... Not ashamed one bit though. ;)  Where Torval really shot themselves in the foot was going for multiple systems close to Fed/Alliance territory. It divided their efforts, making it easier for their opposition, while we have a united front in one system. Provided we take Pancienses we will have the advantage of shorter distances to a control system for all PP operations in that region. That said, our overt aggression in the region has drawn forces from every non-Imperial power to fight us. It's likely that will continue. The Alliance is especially peeved that Pancienses is so close to the Leesti region, and that they can't stop us.  Since our borders are closing in on each other, we may also find ourselves in a prep-war with Fed factions, much like our first cycle with Aisling in Cartoi."
EliteLavigny,3aubqu,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Tue Jun 23 19:23:27 2015 UTC,That's a very good assessment of the situation. There is one other unnoticed effect from our Panciencis expansion.  All our enemies opposition has been concentrated there reducing their ability to oppose our other aims.

Strategically of course with credits in mind. Being raked #1 now with our 50% bounty bonus I feel like players are gunna start flocking to our team after a few weeks in the lead turning us into a runaway train.   Hudson's getting fortifications canceled all over the place and we're barely being touched, I think we're flying under the radar here or have a majority of the dedicated players. We could take advantage of this and prep 6-8 systems spread out along our backside far enough away from our enemies to want to bother with the burden of that commute. This would add a massive uncontested section blanketed over our backs.   This being said if this idea were given the time of day I would think spacing them out enough this week so we could have an easier time filling in the gaps next week.

I can look up stations and match them up with corresponding systems if need be.  If the sorting can be locked out for the future, that might be helpful.  For rote data entry by users, the sorting is unimportant.  Once it comes down and goes off to whoever in the ivory tower does their thing with it, they can unlock and sort it however they please.    Fixing that is going to be a lot of work.  someone deserves a cookie."

EliteLavigny,3av0yc,Endincite,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:40:45 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about this too.  I'm pretty sure that flipping a system requires taking ownership of the system's controlling space station. If Pancienses Network took over a non-controlling space station as the 'victory' for that civil war, then it follows that we'll have to wait for the next civil war before we can flip the system.  However, I've not seen this play out before. It's just theoretical, so I'll be interested to see how Pancienses turns out."

It's a violation of the forum Rules, not all players are over 18 and many of us access these forums when at work. The last thing I want is a meeting with HR over my browser history...  Regarding Anaconda ramming - it's a legit tactic. I ram NPC Eagles in my Vulture whenever I can. The NPCs should use legit tactics and every update brings them closer to human player quality. You fly a Vulture. You have the most agile ship around. Learn to dodge. Need practice dodging? Go to a RES, don't shoot the pirate Anaconda, instead fly within 500m and practice using your throttles and controls to stay within 500m. If you're that tight, the Anaconda's turning radius means she'll never get lined up to ram.   Regarding wings, go to HIP 20277. Lots of players there to wing with on RES patrolling. You'll also see most of the pilots here use their CMDR names. Don't be afraid to send Friend requests.   Regarding the mouse vs joystick debate, there are some really good pilots with mouse & keyboard combo. Takes a lot of practice, though. Go to YouTube and watch AdoreTV.

Your rank is (currently) permanent, once you get it. The red arrow is just your REP with the major faction diminishing over time, which was added in a recent patch.  Ideally, we should be focusing on systems with an empire faction in control and another strong empire faction. Working for the other one will eventually cause a civil war, which gives us the CZs we can make so very much money on. I was making 1 mil (combat bond + 40% bonus) before my shields went down in a LOW CS just yesterday (pick weaker, high value targets - there's no added money for an Elite enemy over a Competent).

I'd highly recommend A-Rank thrusters on the python, you'll notice a pretty significant improvement. I'd also recommend keeping 4 pips in engines whenever you're pitching at a target.

EliteLavigny,3at3u6,Nickab4,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:28:29 2015 UTC,bal I have a question for you. So I got a friend and he runs the rails loadout and uses the D shield due to both power and weight. Will this allow me to pilot it better than say if I was going to beef it up. On the one hand I always have my scb's on hand and dont have to deal with menu shenanigans. On the other of course im not near as beefy. Also I find that unless you agressively adjust power than your not very mobile.(as opposed to say using your Flight assist off and upward boost)
EliteLavigny,3at3u6,rbstewart7263,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:09:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late response, I haven't had power for a day and a half, huge storm hit my town.    I would always suggest aggressively adjusting your power, those settings are meant to be adjusted on the fly (This can be difficult if you're using a mouse and keyboard, try changing your binds around.) As for a D shield, I personally think the FDL's biggest strength is how tanky it is, for a moderate-high mobility 400 ton ship it has massive shields and a strong hull. It also has a unique passive that class one weapons do reduced damage to it's hull. I don't think I would personally be willing to cut down my shield at all. However rail guns are extremely powerful in PvP, so I wouldn't call that build bad, or ineffective, just very risky. You're either going to stomp someone into the ground, or get obliterated, and your opener is extremely key. Flying it would certainly be a good way to work on your piloting skills as it has no margin of error.  Either way, you're going to eventually have to use menu bullshit and aggressive power adjustment, even if you learn FA off. I'd suggest getting used to it as soon as you can. (I hadn't learned those skills when I got into my first FDL, I sold it for a python which was a lot easier, eventually as I learned to fly better I swapped back.) Menu bullshit is pretty inescapable at this ship tier, unfortunately."

EliteLavigny,3at3u6,Hihahas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:11:39 2015 UTC,I tried one out in the last Beta and was looking forward to the idea of a huge hardpoint but found it being on the bottom of the ship made targetting a bit fiddly.  If I spent more time with it i'd probably get used to it I suppose.  How much would a combat fit FDL set me back?

This will set you back by 74 mill + 3.5mil rebuy cost.  this loadout melts most ships in no time, also you'll be able to fire almost continuously.  if you dont have enough credits you can downgrade thrusters, shield generator down to C class and power plant to B class, in that case it will cost you about 61 mill.

Vulture is cheap, maneuverable and can punch hard for it's size. I tried other ships but none work as good as Vulture-   FDL is more of a sidegrade than an upgrade, it is faster and it has bigger weapons, but much worse maneuverability and bad weapon placement. And ugliest cockpit in the game IMO.  Python is a great ship, but worth only if you need more cargo space for smuggling, trading or piracy (as a bounty hunter I don't need cargo space at all). It's one of the worst ships if youre outnumbered, because it's slow and you can't outrun anything except Anaconda. Python is also very expensive when upgraded.  Clipper has not enough firepower and shields for it's price, as a multi-role ship is a good cheaper alternative to Python, but not better than Vulture in terms of combat  sorry for my english =)"

I think i'll probably go for a FDL and try it out for a few weeks.  If I don't like it I can always get another Vulture.

Awesome for a heavy fixed weapon though. I eventually just got rid of it. 2  beams for shields and 2 multicannons for modules. If you're good with fixed weapons, the bottom mount is great for a fixed beam or whatever you prefer. For a cannon though or anything that needs leading, its a bitch."
EliteLavigny,3at3u6,sciencecomic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:08:51 2015 UTC,"I was in the same position when I got bored of my Vulture.  Get a Clipper. FdL is pretty, but it'll feel like a downgrade compared to the Vulture. There's a huge difference between how much damage large weapons do compared to medium ones, even if you've got 4-5 of them. Power management on FdL is even worse. You've got enough to kit out a Clipper for combat though ... well, except for A-class shields. Flies a lot better than a FdL, in my opinion."
EliteLavigny,3at3u6,rbstewart7263,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:09:44 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with a few others here, that 55 mil is not really enough for any of these ships combat-loaded. My FdL is ~80mil, that's A-spec'd. The Python is much more to combat fit, even trade fitted is in the 90s. For me, the Clipper requires a 7A shield with stacked boosters to be effective (it'll still lose shields rapidly - use your speed!), though if you're into stacking cell banks you could get away with less. I think 90mil for a decently combat-worthy Clipper, because the parts cost a fortune.  Remember its more effective to skip around systems doing missions for different factions than it is to stay in one place. I've gone up to Earl since 1.3, even with the ""misfire"" rank missions, doing exactly this."

If you want something that is better for crime sweeps and cannot afford that than you want the fdl.

EliteLavigny,3as342,RemyGreaves,3,Tue Jun 23 01:38:52 2015 UTC,"Thats good work RemyGreaves, thanks for putting in the effort.  I agree we're well organised (despite a few teething problems) and the enthusiasm and dedication our Commanders show is top notch.  I do think we need to go a bit further though.  We need to consider our long term strategy (this may very well be happening at higher levels of course) and plan for a future where, due to the number of control systems we have, the corresponding Upkeep costs are close to the total CC we generate each cycle.  We need to be very aware of the risks involved in over expansion.  The main risk I anticipate is planning expansions based on our available CC, that CC can drop a significant amount if we are comprehensively undermined and we have an advantage at the moment because we have many 'free' systems due to incidences of fortification without undermining.  Should we expand to our limit and then face a concerted undermining operation we might be pushed into turmoil.  I guess what i'm saying is, we need to work on calculating best and worst case scenarios for available CC each cycle so we don't get caught with our pants down."
EliteLavigny,3as342,DMHawker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:41:43 2015 UTC,"Good suggestion, but that maybe beyond the scope of the preparation candidates spreadsheet as you have so many variables such as the matrix of existing Control Systems. If you can think of a quick and dirty way to calculate, please do so.  Remember that for Control Systems 100% in Fortified and 100% in Undermined cancel each out. So, I'm not sure how likely all the CS systems would be undermined successfully without offsetting/cancelling 100% Fortifications."
EliteLavigny,3as342,McFergus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:29:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with stopping what DMHawker says, is we can't stop preparing the maximum amount of systems per week.  Our overhead costs are going to cripple us soon, but if we don't nominate systems and try to get them, we will just get more garbage systems. There are 2 ways to purposefully slow down our expansion, target the same systems that other Powers are prepping in the hopes that they beat us, or nominate expensive targets. By prepping 10 systems per cycle we are rushing faster to turmoil, but what else can we do?"
EliteLavigny,3as342,DMHawker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:45:20 2015 UTC,Dammit I hadn't considered the fact we can't choose how many to expand to.  And we can't choose to stop.
EliteLavigny,3as342,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:09:16 2015 UTC,"There is always the option that we could oppose our own Expansion. We'd lose the expansion cost, but we'd also prevent additional upkeep costs later.  I almost suggested this when we had Guathiti...  Of course, we would wind up being traitors to our Power, I'm not sure how that would work. Probably losing 10 merits per ship."
EliteLavigny,3as342,DMHawker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:14:49 2015 UTC,"The point is that we currently do not suffer from all our control systems being undermined but they are all fortified.  Hudson and Winters have had the opposite.  So the possibilities are:    Control Systems Fortified Undermined Upkeep Cost    Possibility 1 No No 25CC   Possibility 2 Yes Yes 25CC   Possibility 3 No Yes 25CC   Possibility 4 Yes No 0CC    Now if we have 25 Control systems and (for the sake of argument) they all cost 25CC in upkeep and always fortify all of them we have no upkeep costs.    If we only get 5 undermined the cost to us would be 125CC, this is what has happened the last two cycles and is likely to happen this cycle.  Our potential cost though, is 25x25 should all of our systems be undermined, a total of 625CC.  This should be the minimum reserve we keep in case of a concerted push on our space.  If we don't keep that reserve we can be pushed into turmoil.  You are right, fortification and Undermining cancel each other out, but it won't matter if we fortify everything always, we still have to be prepared for the full Upkeep cost."

EliteLavigny,3as342,PFelite,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:06:14 2015 UTC,"BTW, Possibility 3 is wrong. Usually there is a 'cost if undermined' that is significantly higher than the normal upkeep cost. In my experience over 3x higher."

EliteLavigny,3as342,McFergus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"Nice work. I feel what we did this cycle worked very well. Priva became a problem because of compartmentalization, OSI pushing He Xingo became an issue because Aisling will out prep us there. Other than that is went pretty well, so far. We need a list of 10 systems before the next cycle begins. This list will change, everyone has to realize that we don't know where the other Powers will go, we need to quickly made a decision to have a prep war or not. We need a 10 system list to have decent options, I feel that many ALD players don't read reddit, or the ED Forums, so push any system that is currently in the top 10 in game. Giving these players good systems, instead of -15cc systems is critical. We must get 10 systems over 100 prep ASAP when the next cycle begins on Thursday."
EliteLavigny,3as342,aspiringexpatriate,2,Tue Jun 23 01:52:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I agree with you that we need to prep 10 systems ASAP, as those that don't check Reddit and the ED Forums appear to just find the closest system on the in-game list to them (regardless of value) and grind it.      That said, I also agree with your statement that the list will change as we see what other Powers do. So, some of those that jump on the Thursday list might need to accept that their effort (outside of merits), will be wasted when the list changes due to outside forces. Getting them to understand that they need to redirect their efforts elsewhere is a challenge. With increased communication of the why we will learn to overcome that in time."

We dropped Hip (I don't even remember its name) for Tujing in an agreement to not compete with Aisling.  Tujing is worth 30cc less, buts it easier for us to defend. Priva was number one on our list when the word got out that Torval wasn't happy with it (I selected it because its on our border and I didn't want them taking it) We tried to drop it, market forces (or the herd) took over, its still number 1. Martio 75cc was added when it was number 2 or 3 on the list and there was a group of ALD players wanting it.  Its nothing special, but its not like the -15cc system we had last time. Jura 67cc was added for the same reason, its now number 2, there are better systems next to it, but we can't spend all the time fighting each other.

When you look at a system in Expansion or Control, you get a number of Contested Systems, then you can find them in the weird outlined colour on the map.

EliteLavigny,3at1a3,Pootycup,2,Tue Jun 23 07:30:48 2015 UTC,"I think it makes far more sense to use nominations at the beginning of the cycle than the end.  Adding a few nominations here or there will make no difference today, but on Thursday it could move systems on to the prep list, or keep them on the prep list, ahead of whatever junk systems are being pushed."
EliteLavigny,3at1a3,jgmcdee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:39:25 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I still have mine to use, so I'll be checking what was on the prep list for the week and making sure it's in the top 10. Every bit helps I guess. Is there a nomination to corruption report equivalent?  I.e. 1 nomination = 20 delivered reports?  I'm not sure how it works."

EliteLavigny,3asonx,NorwegianDeathHippy,2,Tue Jun 23 04:55:45 2015 UTC,"I had thought of an Armed Transport Group (ATG). Dreamt up a backstory (Arissa activates reserve unit, composed of retired naval officers), and then realized I have no time to create the infrastructure for a group, much less administrate in any way.  Role would be ""Assault Preparation"". Combat capable cargo haulers and escorts, doing targeted runs. Alternate with trade routes to keep money levels up (and pay the escorts!) - most guys can't pour in repeated full, purchased prep loads without income. Need something to go up on the list? Call in ATG II (gave it a number, to sound more military)  As you can probably tell, I'd love someone to take the idea off my hands. I'd join tomorrow. Sorry if you think it sucks. But imagine the effect of even ten 200+ cargo ships hammering on a prep system. Op. Key every week. Besides, so far all the ALD groups are combat-centric, and I know we have lots of traders."
EliteLavigny,3asonx,Endincite,2,Tue Jun 23 06:22:13 2015 UTC,"That's actually a pretty good idea. Being able to do Op. Key every week is exactly what I was hoping to be able to achieve. Even if it's three wings of cargo ships making the run over the course of 2-3 hours, that'll still do a lot.  I'd definitely like to see this happen."
EliteLavigny,3asonx,Sanguine_Redcliffe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:31:05 2015 UTC,I am down for this.  Sounds like a lot of fun.  Would we have armed escorts in the area (instancing issues)?  I just know that as soon as whoever we do this to catches on we will have hit squads/task forces after us.
EliteLavigny,3asonx,Sanguine_Redcliffe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:46:24 2015 UTC,"But of course! It'd be ridiculously silly not to have armed escorts. I know I like to keep my weapons on my Python even when I'm trading with it. Just in case. It would definitely take a lot of coordinating getting the necessary people to make the runs in addition to having armed escorts.  Like, for every 8 cargo ships there should be 4 fighters. Maybe every 12 cargo ships.  Either way, I think we could get a lot done with weekly operations like this."
EliteLavigny,3asonx,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:24:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, directed and combined effort is always superior.  I agree with the 4 fighters for every 8 ships being that they will just be outriders there for combat intervention.  Even if it were just once or twice a week for a couple hours... imagine."
EliteLavigny,3asonx,RemyGreaves,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:27:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Now it's just a matter of getting the numbers together and coordinating this.   Oh, I can imagine. We could easily get in 4,000-5,000 corruption reports over the course of just a few hours.   I'm completely for this. We just need recruits."
EliteLavigny,3ashnu,autobzooty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:46:54 2015 UTC,You could go undermine a Federation system by killing special NPCs there that reward 15 powerplay points per kill.
EliteLavigny,3ashnu,NorwegianDeathHippy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:50:33 2015 UTC,are there any systems in particular being targeted for undermining? I'd like to group up with others if possible!
EliteLavigny,3ashnu,Ubiquitous_Che,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:52:13 2015 UTC,"With Powerplay, the rules for Preperation, Expansion, and Control are all slightly different. Here, I am detailing some of the mechanics of Control.  A control system can be in one of three states: Fortified, Neutral, and Undermined.  Fortified systems reduce their CC cost, granting more CC available for the power the following week.  Undermined systems increase their CC cost, granting less CC available for the power the following week. If a power goes into negative CC, it comes into turmoil, and control systems may rebel.  A neutral system has a moderate cost. May be positive or negative, depending on the system.  The Control aspect of Powerplay is to do with establishing what the end state of each control system will be for the following cycle.  x is fortification, y is undermining.  If x >= 100% and y < 100%, the system will become fortified.  If x < 100% and y >= 100%, the system will become undermined.  In all other scenarios, the system will be reset to neutral.  The moral of the story is this: Once a control system is 100% fortified it is pointless (aside from merit grinding) to continue to fortify or it any further. Move to another system once it hits 100%.  Same for undermining. Once a control system of an enemy faction is 100% undermined, there's no point in continuing undermining that particular system (unless merit grinding).  If all available systems are fortified, or all available enemy systems are undermined, then you need to decide whether or not to switch to something else to benefit the power, or to just grind merits to increase your rank. Which to do depends on where you're at as a player, and what the current need (and their urgency) of the power are."

EliteLavigny,3ashnu,Ubiquitous_Che,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"""Last time I tried to fly out there I got blown up before I could even dock. Is there anyone to fly with in less volatile space?""  You can always head over to the Lavigny's Legion TeamSpeak server to find yourself a wing. Depending on the time of day, the number of available players varies.  I've been winging in Panciences all week, and only ran into a PvP problem once. That problem was kind of my fault, as I allowed myself to get separated from my wing and thus became vulnerable to an enemy FDL.  Wings are good for supporting our expansions for three reasons:  1) Protection from enemy PvPers  2) You take down Lawless NPC targets faster  3) Every member of the wing that damages a Lawless NPC gets 1 merit each on that enemy's death - which multiplies the amount of support gained for the expansion by the number of players in the wing, up to a factor of 4"
EliteLavigny,3ashnu,RemyGreaves,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:08:57 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for a relatively safe environment (few/none PvP engagements), go to HIP 20277.

For the part when you have to fly in your T7, don't worry, there is close to no chance someone will be abble to intercept you before your next jump. I doubt you'll even encounter anyone to be frank !"

EliteLavigny,3aqudw,Endincite,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:08:13 2015 UTC,"Justr noticed that the 3A fuel scoop is a bit too much in therms of cost, if you want a chipper taxi, you can try to get 3c, it will do the job aswell.  An other protip for you: if you set a route on your galaxy map, check if the orange bar which traces it is plain or made of dots. If it's made of dots (probably after a few jumps) that means you'll have to fuel scoop at the system the dots begin."

EliteLavigny,3as5wr,McFergus,4,Tue Jun 23 03:35:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I just got mine and love it so far. It's not cheap to outfit well, but I'm loving it in PvE. Haven't tried PvP, but there are few ships I'd use for that."
EliteLavigny,3as5wr,84Dublicious,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:35:28 2015 UTC,In PvP I would go for the Vulture since rebuy cost can be pretty cheap along with it packs a punch and has some quickness to it. I would go for a Clipper if it was A spec for combat but that requires quite the bit of money. FDL is a good choice for PvP and same for a python. Curious on how a conda performs.

EliteLavigny,3as5wr,brecksolaris,3,Tue Jun 23 03:19:49 2015 UTC,Upon the release of 1.3 I felt like my Clipper turned a little more slowly and its shields could be brought down a little more quickly. Could be my imagination. But I refuse to admit it's garbage until I get my Fer-de-Lance :)
EliteLavigny,3as5wr,CabooseNor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:12:26 2015 UTC,It's not garbage. Fer-de-Lances can be outrun by Cobras. Much harder to escape a Clipper on your ass.
EliteLavigny,3as5wr,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Tue Jun 23 05:40:06 2015 UTC,Any further insights? Some of us are too poor for it.
EliteLavigny,3as5wr,AYKP,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:55:01 2015 UTC,Haha sure I just said this as someone who previously had the Clipper before 1.3 it was a beast and a tank as Brecksolaris stated the clippers shields are 180 and they can be taken down by an eagle or anything really in a few hits.   I was shocked to see this going back to it when powerplay came out and I am just so disappointed that I have to put on 3 Class A Shield boosters and go for a class 7 shield generator instead of keeping it at class 6 now the only reason I care for this is that it takes away from my 128 space cargo hold.   So with a Class 7 Shield gen and 3 Shield boosters it's brought back up to almost what it used to be before 1.3 dying in it can be very easy if you slip up so be careful of that.   I don't exactly think it's complete shit but I am very sad I cannot keep my happy medium of a trader ship with very good offensive capabilities it just makes getting the Python much more worth while due to the fact that this ship requires Large landing pad compared to the Python which is as you all know requires medium. So it seems to me that they made the clipper either go full trader or go full offensive beast.   It also means I have to spend 51 million to get my 7A Shield Gen which I probably wont do since the python has i believe 281 shields and decent hull. I think frontier just widened the gap between the two and made it more noticeable on which one is better to go with.   I have found that maneuverability on it feels the same if not a bit faster on turning around none the less this thing is a tank!
EliteLavigny,3as5wr,Endincite,3,Tue Jun 23 04:35:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they didn't make any changes between 1.2 and 1.3? (Not that I noticed - but I got one in late 1.2.)  As far as we can tell, the difference between a Class 7 and a Class 6 gen is ~50MJ, tops. And yes, they suck compared to the other large ships, but you're not meant to go toe to toe with other large ships. It's a clipper, not a man-of-war.  And I'd argue that it's a perfect all-rounder ship. Is it going to be the best at fighting? Nope. Is it the best for trading? Also nope. But can it do both? Without refitting Oh yes.   Leave the 128 cargo hold there, and you can run small amounts of PP cargo, and minor trades to earn money.  The size 3 weapons slots enable you to kill small ships in crime sweeps/conflict zones and strip the shields of larger ones for others in your wing.  Strap in a 5A FSD and a 4C Fuel tank, and you can go interdicting in the furthest parts of Fed space.  If you encounter FdL/Anaconda/Pythons, outrun them.  It's the near-perfect, all-round basking machine. And you'll look really good doing it too!"
EliteLavigny,3ao6mg,Babyjoka,2,Mon Jun 22 03:12:29 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that a portion of the merits from the previous week carry over. That includes a slightly smaller portion of the merits from the week before previous, etc.  So you don't have to earn the entire merit bank in a single week. Just maintaining a sufficiently high merit income from week to week would be enough to push you up over the limit on carry-overs alone.  I'm not sure what the algorithm is for calculating how many merits carry over, so I can't do the math for you. But there's some number X of merits where, if you earn X merits per week, then after Y weeks you'll scrape in to Rank 5."

E.G - Winter's control systems are killing Fed Couriers, and expansion are killing Fed Aid ships.  But please leave undermining for Friday onwards.

EliteLavigny,3ao6mg,AYKP,2,Mon Jun 22 04:36:08 2015 UTC,"You get 15 merits per kill when undermining non-imperial powers  You get 1 merit per cargo pirated when undermining imperial powers  You get 1 merit per kill when opposing or helping expansion attempts for some powers  You get 1 merit per cargo carried to prepare a system.  You get 1 merit per cargo carried to fortify a system.  15 merits per interdiction/kills on non-imperial powers is the most viable while spending no money or having no cargo space  1 merit per prep/fort cargo can be viable if you spend the money to fast track (10,000cr per cargo), and can ship enough tons per hour"

EliteLavigny,3ao6mg,jgmcdee,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:54:23 2015 UTC,"If you consistently earn x amount of merits a week then the amount of merits you start a week with will be given by  x + x/2 + x/4 + x/8  The amount of merits you'll have at the end of a given week will be  x + x + x/2 + x/4 + x/8  And, it's the merits you have at the end of the week that determines rating. So, solving  x + x + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 = 10000  for x gives you the minimum merits you need a week. This comes to   just under 3479. (Obviously, the x/4 + x/8  part hasn't come into play yet because PP is only in its third week)  To summarize, you need a minimum per week (NOT average) of the following amounts of merits to get to and maintain the given rating: 3479 (rating 5) 522 (rating 4) 261 (rating 3)"
EliteLavigny,3ao6mg,CMDR_Hann,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"A way to somewhat passively earn merits if you don't have a ton of free time is to get a transport ship, sit yourself in a dock, and set a timer for 30 minutes.

You won't make money, but you'll make merits. I recommend winging up, especially if you are in open. Winging up helps you farm merits faster, as each kill will grant a merit for each member of the wing who tags a target. Once you collect some merits, head to one of our ""Control Systems"" and turn them in. Check other threads on the /r/EliteLavigny subreddit. If you'd like information about things in general in our space, check the wiki."

Do be careful though if you go there, seeing as it's being heavily undermined and enemy players are targeting us in supercruise.  Though, you could go to any other system on the list for crime sweeps. They function like conflict zones, except that you enter already aligned with the appropriate faction. Killing the enemy faction rewards 1 powerplay point.  If you were to go and undermine an enemy faction's system, killing their npcs rewards 15 powerplay points per kill. Enemy, by the way, would be the Federation and Independent powers."

EliteLavigny,3anosn,ImperiusII,2,Mon Jun 22 01:18:40 2015 UTC,"I kind of assume we'll be undermined in every system each cycle, the fact we're not is probably due to giving the Feds too many problems to handle.  If we continue to push the expansion in Panciencis, they will continue to try and oppose us, and when we win (which we will) all that opposition will be wasted effort they could have used profitably elsewhere.  In short, every Commander they have in Panciensis is one less Commander available to expand or prepare their systems or undermine ours."
EliteLavigny,3anosn,DMHawker,2,Mon Jun 22 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I meant this would be a good thing to mimic to maximize our ""return on investment"" for undermining Federal targets.

EliteLavigny,3aky0i,CMDR_ChaiN,2,Mon Jun 22 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"This is probably the single most common issue with PP on the forums. Lots of grind with no return. I've dumped a ton of Cash and had some fun doing it, but soon I'm going to have to go back to trading just to recoup... which will piss me off.  I argued vehemently when 1.3 came out that powerplay could only be better if it were worth everyone's while.   In the meantime, it's be nice to have a few expansion targets reserved for those with RES nearby, so our efforts come with some reward. There's an economic aspect of expansion that we haven't yet touched upon. Right now our few known convenient RES are swamped in open, because the only area charted for RES is that around Kamadhenu. It'd be great to get some RES near Pancienses (provided we win), for instance, so that you'd have a convient source of cash near a strategic position.   I'm charting out our territory near Nunus right now for useful stuff, because it's already an awesome area for missions, but it's far from the action."

Plus, what's the logic behind making Sidewinders and Anacondas worth the same amount of merits?!  At the very least there should be some sliding scale that's tied to ships mass or the pilot level (expert/master/dangerous/etc).  As is, I'd almost be better off grabbing an Eagle or a Viper so at least my operating costs and potential rebuy are much lower."

At least our huge bounty bonuses can compete with trade for money making, I make 750k in a RES without even trying (thats Cobras & Vipers, not the ""golden instance"" of better ships). You can't really make money actually doing Powerplay tasks. I had a lot of excess money at the release of 1.3, so I went all in, but now I'm coming to a point where I have to go make money again.

In any PvP encounter, my expectation is that if I am losing, I will do my best to run away. That is why I own a Clipper. Is this not the smartest way to fly?  The reaction should not be writing a post calling them names. It should include writing a post warning about an Alliance wing in Pancienses that is interdicting Cmdrs. That is useful news and worthwhile reporting. Hell, it could even be an entertaining combat story.  Additionally, the reaction can include finding 3 more Lavigny PvPers and going duck hunting.  Keep up the good work, and thanks for contributing."

I did not say that this is not a way to fight, I just think it to be dishonorable. If that does not matter to them, good for them, but that is not my way to fight. I call them cowards, as they gang up on people, not only on stronger enemies, on everyone, surely you agree that that is indeed cowardly behavior. And wannabe PVPers, as they appear to not have much experience in that field and do not understand/follow the rules of a Duel."
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,Nickab4,2,Sun Jun 21 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as a cowardly PvPer. (Outside of Hackers/Exploiters/Combat Loggers) An intelligent player uses any means that lacks a cost outside the scope of the situation to win a battle. Lying about  a duel being fair has very little cost, It's a smart move. If I was him, (during an open war) I would of jumped in with my whole wing at full strength and tried to blow you out of the sky. Honor in war is a foolish notion that will only hold you back, and any PvP in this game comes at a considerable risk and thus cannot be cowardly. (Again with the exception of Exploiters/Hackers/CombatLoggers)"

My organisation is that of a mercenary one, we accept contracts from anyone and do not discriminate, we will use any tactics that do not involve exploits etc, we do what we must to win even if only hired, I have to say I have a lot of respect for those Lavigny's Legion that put up a good fight and gave us some very good PVP and I respect you for that, I hope that in the future we can get a contract together involving a powerplay objective etc and that we are stepping down our support for Winters and the federation at the end of the cycle and becoming neutral and up for hire once again, see you in the black. o7"

EliteLavigny,3amc0y,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:25:57 2015 UTC,"I think under-handed tactics add to the game, it allows people with strong RP backstories who would oppose those tactics to try and win without said tactics, which ends up being a lot fun."
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,Nickab4,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"If anything in Power Play is cowardly, it is going into another Power's peacefully controlled space, and interdicting and destroying trading vessels.  I wouldn't say ""cowardly"", I'd use ""mercenary"" as an adjective.  They'd likely take it as a complement.  As for the rules of a duel, in duels you are meant to each have a second. If your opponent's second breaks the sanctity of it, the other second can try to help you extricate peaceably. Also, duels usually do not happen after you ""pull someone off his horse on a battlefield"". (I've got no better analogy for what interdiction from the 'Shift in an actively contested system appears to be.)  Did his wingmen know he had accepted a challenge to a duel, or only that he'd been interdicted?  From your story alone, not his, it does not sound like a duel, but a battlefield challenge. Those do not really have rules."
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,j4ckd4w,2,Sun Jun 21 19:25:05 2015 UTC,"I have to agree, shouting 'Duel Me' in a war-zone just sounds fool-hearty."
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,aspiringexpatriate,2,Sun Jun 21 19:35:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, you should both appear with your wings. And your mates shuold counter his mates.  And of course then you would have witnesses and movies from diffrent angles if you guys are using Shadowplay.    And that could be glorious."
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,Chef-Jitsu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:36:58 2015 UTC,"Thats the thing, I sent him a message while we all were in supercruise, that I would fight him 1vs1, but would not fight his whole wing. He agreed to that so I told him I would drop out of sc and wait for him. He showed up alone, no one else followed until he lost his shields. I even asked him if he was ready, he faced me before the fight started, no one had a disadvantage. The only rule in this fight was mine, that he would fight me alone, they tried to interdict me several times before that. If he would have wanted to escape, a python cant chase anything that it would masslock (only the T-series, but those do not qualify as a combat vessel) so he could have just left and accepted his defeat, but no, he chose to bring in his wing to try to kill me. Of course, no one likes to be called a coward, but in fact, every single time you choose to not die in a battle that you have chosen, but to run, you are one. That includes me, just not in this situation."
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,Nickab4,0,Sun Jun 21 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"Weird. I had no idea you could get this many different stories from one incident in a computer game. If it's true in life, it's true in a game.  Different definitions of cowardice is fine, but calling someone a coward does sound like sore losing. It doesn't matter if it's true, it doesn't make you look better."
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:03:30 2015 UTC,"So, lesson learned, don't trust the Alliance, those guys are cowards and have no honor. (At least those 4)   The post was not about me looking better, but to show people that you cant trust everyone's word. Some have honor, some do not. And to clarify, I did not lose the fight against him, to lose against 4 enemies at once, there is no shame in that :)"
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,Eran_Mintor,0,Sun Jun 21 20:09:13 2015 UTC,You fly alone in a war zone that is your fault. And your fair fight was far from it while the Security showed up with an Anaconda and about 5 other ships. We protect our own and chose the battle ground. You fly alone that is not our fault. You tried the same tactics. You failed. Sorry your Operation Key is in lock down in Open Play... o7  Edit: And shhhhh  don't mention when you were in a wing of 3 and interdicted the Courier it might not go well with the narrative.
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,Chef-Jitsu,2,Sun Jun 21 17:47:59 2015 UTC,"While O-Key certainly Isn't in lock-down (There are more than five 'Open' instances running at once ATM, a lot of people on both sides are out here.)  I tend to think you're in the right, a warzone is not place to expect a fair fight, and wandering it alone is ill advised. However, flying for the Federation isn't a smart move friend, you will pay personally in the future. :)"

I'm not the guy who makes those calls, but I'll fly with you guys anytime it's in the Empire's interest. That said, in character Balthomas is disgusted by mercenaries, and he'd only fly with them because he was ordered too. Of course, if you're fighting with us, that'd likely happen I'm sure. Thanks for the fights )"
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,Chef-Jitsu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:37:23 2015 UTC,"Once the security showed up, we agreed to fly away so they dont harass us, his shields dropped while there was no security around. They only came back once that little Courier of yours started shooting me. He could have easily escaped me at any point, the python cant chase anything. And Starkiller admitted, after you guys dropped in, he had no intention to have a fair fight. So don't try to turn this around, you know what you did.   Edit: I was never in a Wing, the whole time there. I dropped into some low wakes, to protect other CMDRs, interdicting was always me alone."
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,Eran_Mintor,-1,Sun Jun 21 18:01:31 2015 UTC,Not so sure about the wing thing. Star may have had the intentions of calling us in that does not change the fact you are looking for a fair fight with smaller ships in a war zone. Fair is just about the most dreadful tactic. I take no shame in killing Imperials that invade an Independent system with the intent of setting up a front line to strike at the Federation. I have seen the Dangerous News Network interview and had a run in with Imperious II.
EliteLavigny,3amc0y,Sp00nMan1,2,Sun Jun 21 18:08:55 2015 UTC,"For clarity: Power Play is not about invasions and open warfare.  We fight in the shadows, maintaining the cold war between the three major powers in the galaxy.  Senator Torval did not fight a war in Kappa Fornacis, her people aided her in an hostile takeover of the local governing corporations.  Senator Duval does not have forces invading an Independent system. Senator Duval, after informing the population of the system of the horrific corruption of their system authorities, has been invited to extend her influence to secure law and order and fight corrupt authority vessels in the system. We are facing stout opposition from the ruling party and their temporary allies.  Lore ftw"

I would suggest hopping over to the nearest High Intensity Resource Site and get to killing. I do it on a private group so I am not forced to lose a kill to another CMDR. I don't know about you, but after resetting the instance enough to where heavier ships like the python and vultures come in steadily, I can make about 6 million in 45 minutes. I have nothing fancy to fly, just a Vulture. You have to be careful though, some of the clippers and pythons can pack a punch. If you can't win the fight by yourself, lock onto your target and wait for the cops to show up and go to work on him. Once you're comfortable with the remaining health levels, go get your hits in. Also recommend playing some music to keep things going. I often find myself waiting 5 or 10 minutes at max for the next target. I guess sometimes they get in a spawn lock or something."

You can have quite some fun in it bounty hunting, i know i found it a solid lower budget replacement for vulture for RES and CZ farming. Go for one class 2 beam and gimballed multicannons on it. You will cover it's rebuy costs with one serious visit to the RES. Learn to use ships with lower rebuy/repair costs for a certain task, it helps. Enjoy!"

I find that the lack of large hardpoints makes it not as usable for hunting large ship spawns in RES sites, but i can certainly work my way back up, given enough time.   If i had been thinking more rationally, i likely wouldn't have brought my Python out to Pancake, but it seemed needed at the time. Hopefully I'll Learn from this."
EliteLavigny,3amw01,Ubiquitous_Che,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"""loans should cover you if you dont have enough cash on hand.""  Always beware the use of the word 'should'. :)  Basically, you can check out your rebuy cost and the available loan amount in the right-hand panel. Your available loan scales with your ranks in the game. So higher ranks mean bigger loans available as needed.  General rule of thumb:  Try to keep enough cash on hand that you don't have to rely on loans for a rebuy.  If you do go under this amount, make absolutely sure you don't go under the cash-on-hand amount needed to top up your rebuy cost, assuming you take out the full loan amount."
EliteLavigny,3amw01,shallowkal,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:17:37 2015 UTC,"yeah, ""should"" just became one of the scariest words in this game for me. ging to farm a new vulture, and this time im keeping it instead of selling it for the Python.   I wasnt aware that the loan amount was in my system's panel, i must have missed it when i was poking around there last. I honestly am still surprised with the speed i was taken apart, but that probably just means i need to re-evaluate the defenses of my vessels if i am considering PvP.   the credit loss hurt, but hopefully i can make up for it with simply learning to be more cautious."
EliteLavigny,3amw01,Haon007,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:19:10 2015 UTC,"It's worth remembering that because you're in a bigger ship, you also present a bigger target.  I had the exact same problem when I moved from an Eagle to a Viper. NPC's that couldn't touch me in an Eagle would take me apart in a Viper in seconds.  Essentially, I had to completely change how I flew for the Viper.  I'm nowhere near a Python unfortunately, so I can't give you much advice other than chaff and shield cell banks. :)"

EliteLavigny,3akbe1,Darshendros,2,Sun Jun 21 04:47:30 2015 UTC,I am in the same boat.  I need to pull my ships out of Alliance space.  I have an Asp and T-7 that I want to pull to headquarters.  I am working on Empirial stops from this list:  71 Stop Rare Route  It will take some work but I would suggest starting there and sitting on the Galaxy map for a bit and see what looks promising to you.  As soon as I get mine together I will post here.  EDIT  Just found this little tidbit.  This should help a lot.  Rare Trade Clusters  Orignally posted here by /r/iwantogofishing

EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,Endincite,4,Sat Jun 20 21:07:52 2015 UTC,"PvP isn't for everyone, either due to lack of ability, disability or even poor internet connection.  It's not exactly my forte either.  But your idea of Silent Running has some possibilities.  Try a Diamondback Explorer with lots of Heatsinks, they have great heat management and your enemies will find it very hard to get a lock on you."
EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,DMHawker,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge they can't get a lock on any ship in silent mode. They can use fixed weapons if they actually see me, which is why my small black FdL might be perfect. I'm not really sure this'll work at all though. They will see heatsinks, and i won't be able to change direction of they come my way."
EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,DMHawker,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:32:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the FDL has the heat management to pull it off, I haven't had one yet. The DB Explorer runs very cool though, if you put multicannons on it you won't need to use heat sinks and you wont be hiding in Silent Running, you'll be hunting them."
EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:32:23 2015 UTC,"Gutayama ships have insane heat management, too.  If there are four of them and you don't have a distraction, don't expect it to work. But if your other option is shut down and die, well, might as well try it.  I'm shit at evasive maneuvers, but that's the only way you're going to live long enough to get away. It's not just rolling and such, you need to rapidly change your direction and trajectory, but not so fast that you wind up sitting still.  You could try losing them in a ring belt? Try using gravity wells to your advantage in the 'Shift to keep yourself out of interdiction range?  Get a Clipper and just boost away?"
EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,Nickab4,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:32:31 2015 UTC,"The FDL should be able to tank four ships for long enough to charge a high-jump. Go 4 pips shields, fly erratically and spam shield cell banks end to end (don't wait to take damage, pop one as soon as possible to get them rolling, any ground lost you can't gain back.) while charging a high jump. Turn at the last second to face your destination. When you finish the high jump emergency drop to low space, then high jump somewhere else. It will be impossible for them to follow you. The only ships that can outrun the FDL are the Cobra and Clipper. So most of the time a boost away strat is a good option. Just always remember when you're on the defensive to use high jumps and have four pips in shields as often as possible.  You'll only survive a four man interdiction if you act quickly and decisively, any hesitation will kill you. Rest assured you're flying one of the best ships to survive a fight. the FDL is fast, maneuverable, and tanky. (On your silent running idea: Never willingly drop your shields, if they go down then toggle SR, but never lose your shields by choice, every gimbaled weapon is a fixed weapon in the hands of a competent pilot.)  Side Note: Being a PvP Pilot is no different than being a PvE pilot with the exception that it requires a cool head under pressure, and some descent game knowledge. After that the better pilot (or ship depending on situation) wins. Also, losing isn't bad, it rewards valuable experience. Learn from your mistakes and never give up and you can accomplish pretty-much anything."

EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,Droid8Apple,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:06:05 2015 UTC,It has lots of guns
EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,Isabelle_Montbarron,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:08:15 2015 UTC,"Its boost speed with A thrusters is more like 405. Cobra, Viper and Clipper can catch it, but can't (typically) fight it, so its a good ship to have. I'm pretty sure it was just the two FdLs keeping pace and shooting, but I'm stunned that the mass lock from the Pythons lasted that long.  Edit: For comparison, a Clipper with A thrusters can boost above 440, and never fall below 425 with continuous boosting - the thing is all engines and power."
EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:00:22 2015 UTC,"And two guns with shit convergence.  An A Courier can keep up with 405, iirc."
EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,Droid8Apple,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:15:16 2015 UTC,A thrusters on FDL boost it over 400.... Like 403. Python is boosting at 383 almost constantly. It's recharged and ready to boost before the game will actually allow it so it's a constant speed. A7 distributor and not too tanky that is. Anyhow it sounds like Adles Armada in a wing like that.
EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,Droid8Apple,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:41:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately PVP is a cloud of chaff, so lots of them are using fixed."
EliteLavigny,3ajn1i,sciencecomic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:25:53 2015 UTC,"One other option is of course to pick a very fast ship put 4 pips to engines (and probably 2 to sys) when not in combat, submit when you get interdicted (makes FSD cooldown ridiculously short), and immediately start boosting away until you can fire up your FSD again.  The Cobra (fastest I think), and Imperial Clipper (very fast but with a bit more power than the Cobra) are both excellent choices for this.  Either way sticking a chaff launcher on is certainly a good choice as it causes gimballed weapons to not lock properly on you for a short duration (and a lot of people use gimballed weps)."

We had 4 full wings in FOS Guardian for PVP last night and ended up just farming the Crime Sweeps.  I'm all for helping the ""Torvaluables"" - they are a good bunch with level heads."
EliteLavigny,3aib27,CMDR_Corrigendum,2,Sat Jun 20 13:34:24 2015 UTC,Holy hell we had 4 wings that traveled the galaxy last night and zero fights. If there's one thing we're great at is getting there early.

EliteLavigny,3aib27,CMDR_Swift_Arrow,0,Sat Jun 20 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"I think its ridiculous that PP can be effected during solo play, FD needs to fix this at some point, in fact solo play should have no impact on open whatsoever.

EliteLavigny,3aib27,j4ckd4w,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:08:42 2015 UTC,"What is really the diffrence - solo or another instance ? Looks the same to me.

EliteLavigny,3ah66z,CdnGuy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"That's all well and good, but the Emperor has absolute executive authority within the Empire. The Senators have the power they do because he allows it. What if he doesn't like what they've been doing whilst he's been out of action? Here's just a few examples:   Patreus tried to strong-arm Quivira into Imperial Slavery in a blatantly unfair, albeit legal, fashion Torval has a very loose approach to the regulations of Imperial Slavery as has been well-documented since release Aisling is trying to outright abolish Imperial Slavery Arissa has tried to smuggle arms to refugees in direct defiance of another Senator's legal conduct Arissa and Torval are currently directly attempting to project power into Federal territory   There's been a lot more than that these last six months. If the Emperor doesn't like any of it, there will be serious upheaval on the way."
EliteLavigny,3ah66z,Monolith12,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"This really isn't different from ancient Rome. The senators can hold whatever views they like and run their domains as they please, so long as they don't challenge him. If Aisling outlaws imperial slavery in her domain the Emperor doesn't give two shits. It only matters to him if it causes problems for him, and if so he'd tell her to knock it off. Then, if she didn't, it would be treason.  Until things get to the point of a personal directive from the Emperor the senators would be free to do as they wished."

EliteLavigny,3ah66z,AYKP,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:44:10 2015 UTC,I did not expect that. I was sure the Emperor would die throwing the sucession into chaos with an acompanying change tot the treachery  penalty so imperial players could oppose each other effectivley.  Pretty sure now we're going to see a higher rate of new members from this too.
EliteLavigny,3ah66z,DMHawker,2,Sat Jun 20 09:59:45 2015 UTC,"A part of me is wondering if this is a play by Chancellor Blaine for time, while he watches the ongoing power play between the senators, and that the Emperor is actually still very sick.  The other part notices his comment:   Doubtless the Princess’s father would be extremely proud.   He says ""the Princess's father"", not ""the Emperor"". He's hedging his bets in case she isn't the Emperor's daughter."
EliteLavigny,3ah66z,cmdrmarx,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"I dont think the Emperor has regained conciousness, or the ability to communicate yet or Blaine would have said the Emperor is proud of her rather than doubtless would be.  I suspect the Emperor has to recover, even if only temporarily to ensure Frontier can arrange things so all the Imperial candidates have a reasonable claim to the throne. At the moment Arissa is the Chancellor's, and more importantly the Emperor's, choice as the next Empress and Arissa is the only candidate that had nothing to gain from the assassination plot."

I was an hour and a half in with just under 100 merits to deliver at the time I died.  :(  I understand that a single CMDR doesn't stand in for an entire faction.

EliteLavigny,3ai1ds,HeavyGroovez,2,Sat Jun 20 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"Calennero is one jump from HIP 20277. It's Low Security, which some people think means you'll get better spawns. The High Intensity RES is around the fifth planet. The system is undiscovered by default; you might want to bring a scanner. There's one station, an outpost; it's not near Calennero 5 at the moment. So maybe it's less appealing than HIP 20277, but it's also less-trafficked if you want to play in Open and not compete for kills.  Edit: See also the wiki."

Say, we accept to expand to some place (I am not against it), then this space is a neutral 'international/duty-free' zone. That would fit the corp lore nicely.  Our alliance with the Alliance is of defensive nature, not offensive. We are not looking to start fights, its too unprofitable. Selling high quality ships and weapons to people who do, on the other hand..."
EliteLavigny,3ae4yj,CMDRMuetdhiver,3,Fri Jun 19 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you wanted to do that, you could put it straight in the middle of the Federation/Empire conflict, if everyone knew ahead of time it could be neutral territory.

Also, I myself love your ships, and the sound the engine makes when it spools is unmatched bliss. A couple points below!      Yes, we have an alliance with the Alliance (IMBA); from what I can understand, it's a mutually beneficial pact centered around economics as opposed to being strictly about combat. CMDR /u/Toleer is our contact/liaison with the Alliance. There was a prep war with Winters earlier, but I think that's over and done now. There are peace talks among Winters (Federation) and the Alliance, which can possibly extend to Sirius. I believe Sirius Gov is true neutral as well; despite having several combat pilots (myself included) we don't go out of our way to engage in combat. Lately we have seen an uptick in aggression from wings of other factions (Kumo Crew, Patreus), but I feel like those attacks are not representative of those factions as a whole. Myself and several others own (or will soon obtain) the Courier. We love everything about it- what a wonderful ship! Some of us really like trade! Did I mention we love the Courier?      Cheers!

On our relationship with the alliance; It's not very clear, I've heard different things from almost everyone I've talked to. It seems likely the general consensus is that the alliance is concerned that if we defeat the Federation than they would be 'next' I can't speak for everyone, but the majority of Lavigny pilots I fly with and have spoken to have no quarrel with the Alliance, and would like to smooth over that relationship as much as possible, we're not looking to conquer the galaxy. (There's very little logical incentive for us to.)   On the situation with the Federation; We're pretty clearly at war with the Federation, but I doubt anyone has an interest in pulling Sirius into that war. If the Federation was to attack you, I can personally say I'd be happy to fly support and help, but I would also have no interest in asking you to fight the Federation for us.  On Kumo Crew; I'm personally Skeptical about the likely hood of peaceful coexistence with the Archon. More so than that, I'm concerned about bounty-immune C.O.D.E. members flying around space pirating without any concern.

I 1-2 months they plan to move them onto our Galaxy Server (we won't be able to see them, but they'll be part of our economy and powerplay universe.) Currently XB1 players are overwhelmingly supporting Hudson or Felicia. (which makes sense, because they're starting out with powerplay running, and it doesn't make sense to try to travel 200ly to some other power in a sidewinder.) This means when the servers combine the Federation will get a very large influx of players. XB1 is a very different community from ours, and I don't personally see them being too interested in picking a faction based on lore, although that is just my personal opinion.  You have a good point about not everyone being on/listening to Reddit, however it would likely be possible to mount an escort, which likely wouldn't require more than 1-3 pilots. It's not likely you'd encounter an organized attack, just possibly a random player or two who isn't aware of the situation."

EliteLavigny,3ae4yj,marioclone,2,Fri Jun 19 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest arguments I've seen for giving Sirius an Imperial Shipyard is the Clipper, presently they do not have a discounter Clipper in their space so It's simply not an option to buy one through their discounts. Obviously this is only one ship, but it's certainly an important ship, getting more of our navy into clippers benefits us greatly. As for Sirius, I suppose it will most likely depend on their relationship with the Federation and Alliance.  If the Federation does continue to stay hostile to them, it wouldn't be much trouble for us to help out in those conflicts. (We already spend 90% of our time fighting them anyway.) Really it wouldn't even require Lavigny's Legion or most of Lavigny's Navy to make a considerable positive impact in Sirius space, a wing of combat pilots could make a lot of difference over a few weeks, and probably set up/defend a buffer system to help out. I know quite a few pilots who would want a Sirius outpost nearby, I think many of them (Myself Included) would be willing to fly such a mission."

Pancienses should have a fair amount of PvP this week.  Control Systems won't be a hotbed of PvP, but you will find some enemy Cmdrs undermining us if you stick around long enough. My suggestion is to spend your time PvE hunting in control systems, and always check those hollow targets to see if there are hostile Cmdrs in system."

If we don't know what ten systems we'll be expanding into next week, we can't really plan which systems we'll prepare the next week.

It would be prudent to have some confirmation though - some kid with a grudge shouldn't be able to destroy someone's game. If anyone else is attacked by these two, report it please."
EliteLavigny,3ad1zv,Endincite,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:43:40 2015 UTC,"If we do have a KoS list and it doesn't conflict with how FDev wants to run the game, we do need more evidence than one report. Hell, there isn't even any proof that the commander who posted this is a Lavigny pledge.  Yes, if we have evidence of betrayal without defection, we do need to keep track of it. But we also need evidence, which can include multiple eye witness reports, but likely also first hand corroboration from a volunteer investigator."
EliteLavigny,3ad1zv,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:41:14 2015 UTC,"I've been considering ways to create a private subreddit with only verified Lavigny members, but there's honestly no way to do it as of yet.   For reference, Ingress has a system to do this where you request to join a G+ group, then ping the admins over in-game chat and they approve you. The only reason this wouldn't work in ED is because we don't have persistent chat over sessions (aka you can't log in and see messages that were sent to a public chat while you were offline).  But on the direct topic of tracking a KoS list, it could go so far as requiring 10 report points to be recorded. Video evidence adds 2 or 3 points, photo evidence adds 1 (considering how easily it can be faked in comparison). Text only requests add 0 points, but are recorded and may be taken into consideration in future."

We've made it to the #1 spot even with these communication difficulties- all we can do is improve that.   The wrong thing to do is give someone a hard time about where they post when they selflessly give the time reaching out, investigating, and getting their hands dirty.

EliteLavigny,3ad0pb,jgmcdee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:27:35 2015 UTC,I think we're too late this cycle.  Priva and HIP 43197 (and LHS 1852) are in the in-game preparation list and most people will follow that list.  Tujing is on Aisling's preparation list.  I strongly suggest that you go back to Aisling and say that she takes Tujing and we take HIP 43197.  Anything else and we're swimming against the tide and risk both sides wasting lots of merits and generating much bad feeling.
EliteLavigny,3ad0pb,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:53:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, and obviously someone made a major push for Tujing last night as it's now on our prep list as well.  This cycle isn't going to end well for diplomatic relations with our nearest neighbour."

EliteLavigny,3ad0pb,McFergus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:26:39 2015 UTC,"Oh? For future diplomatic reference, when a system takes a spot that high so quickly, it is due to good pilots who listen to suggestions pouring in lots of credits.  It probably isn't a great idea to negotiate away their hard work when they were doing it at our recommendation.  For everyone else's future reference: /u/McFergus /u/EdgarStarwalker when we make our endorsement recommended threads, we do need to include a disclaimer that the recommendations can change, so while we need to get them on the list as fast as possible, we don't want to encourage pilots to pour a massive amount of credits into them before they settle more firmly."

Just fight in crime sweeps? Interdict hollow Cmdr ships from enemy factions that I find in supercruise? Both? What's best?
EliteLavigny,3aa2tf,leokeiangelos,2,Thu Jun 18 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"Both are good, though the main focus should be on crime sweeps at the moment."

We are losing the preparation war with AD in Tujing (we haven't really started there) and HIP 43197. I think winning HIP 43197 will be hard enough without adding Shaplintin. Maybe we can swap out HIP 43197 for one of the other ones up there. Also got the negative bonus on expanding up there, we need an extra 1/3 for Pancienses because it isn't Feudal or Patronage, and its distance form our capital.

We get bonuses to expand and fortify those systems.  20CC extra is pretty good, but how many systems can we fortify each week?  We will probably get 8-10 more again, to add to the 10 we are currently expanding, and the 7 new control systems we have. I think we should now be prioritizing all Feudal and Patronage systems that have large stations close to the star, and have decent (70+) CC profit."

EliteLavigny,3ab8pl,Vustom,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:16:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly at your level i would find a regular or even low res. The key is to log in for an hour a day, kill lots of stuff, log out, after a week you take your giant bag of bounties to the station.  Alternatively, buy an interdictor, go to the nearest hudson expansion, and pull fed agents/supply until you have 1.5k P, this will get you 5M a week later."
EliteLavigny,3ab8pl,Sammyhain,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:49:45 2015 UTC,How do I go about doing the alternative? Is there a guide of some sorts I could use?
EliteLavigny,3ab8pl,Darshendros,2,Thu Jun 18 20:09:52 2015 UTC,"I would just stick with bounty hunting for now until you can better outfit your ship. With the Viper's poor jump range, you're going to need a fuel scoop to get to any of Hudson's systems, along with an interdictor (which aren't that expensive at D-grade, which would be all you need, but you'll have to fuel scoop every couple jumps or so to get there ... which can take a while if you're going over 100Ly). Low intensity and regular extraction sites are your best bet right now. Once you get some serious firepower going, you can jump into the high intensity ones, but those usually carry higher skilled ships.  And most guides you can find on Youtube or the FD forum."
EliteLavigny,3ab8pl,TheLiimbo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:12:16 2015 UTC,"To hopefully answer some of your questions:  What have I been doing wrong [1]? Sometimes it does take a bit to find a ship that is Wanted (although it's supposed to be that you can find more/better bounties at High RES from my understanding), which doesn't necessarily mean you're doing anything wrong. If it's taking a really long time to find something, you can always re-enter the instance (leave and then just come immediately back) to reset it. As far as the scanning of people goes; if you've already scanned them (not Kill Warrant scan) and they show up as 'Clean' at the RES, don't bother running the KW scanner. While they may end up having a bounty, they are Clean in the system you are in, and so picking a fight with them will give you a bounty. If you are using a KW scanner there, wait til you see someone who is already Wanted, and give them a scan.  What's the best to get credits with that I have (which is almost nothing)? I'd say stick with the bounty hunting, like Sammyhain was saying. You can always put on some music and blow up some pirates for an hour or so a day (depending on your free time) once you get comfortable with how things work.  What's the fastest way to rank up so I get a higher salary/bigger bounty bonuses? I've found that the fastest way (at least IMO) is to undermine Federation control/expansion attempts. It's easy to pull Haulers and Adders and Type-6 out of space and blow them up for 15 merits a kill. You can easily pull in 500 merits this way in an hour, just until you're really comfortable flying the Viper don't go after like the Cobras or anything yet; Once you fire on them after the interdiction, the crime is reported and you will only have a certain window of time to kill them before the Security ships from the sector will show up, so it's easiest to stick to the things you can kill fast.  What loadout would be best for the Viper (will probably change to Vulture when I have more money)? In E:D there really isn't a 'best' loadout for any ship- it's all about what you want to do with the ship. For me, personally, on my little Viper I had some gimballed Beam lasers and some Gimballed cannons for when I went to RES. The beams to take out shields, the cannons for the hull, and the chunk of damage that the cannons would do at a time helped if I was competing for the bounty with other CMDRs.  If I find someone who is lawless, do I get anything for killing them? Lawless just means that you are in an Anarchy system... Which basically means 'anything goes'. Those places don't have any sort of police, so no crimes get reported in that system, so you can open fire on and kill anything you want there. As a bounty hunter, though, it's best to wait and see what the NPC's say when you run into them (whether indictment or USS or whatever) as the ones talking about your potential cargo most likely have bounties elsewhere, so you can KW scan and then kill them."
EliteLavigny,3ab8pl,Ubiquitous_Che,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:13:20 2015 UTC,"What have I been doing wrong?  Firstly: Have you considered downgrading to an Eagle?  In a fair fight between CMDRs of equivalent skill who know what they're doing, a Viper will beat an Eagle. The viper's speed and increased armaments are superior to the Eagle's slight edge in maneuverability.  If, that is, you know what you're doing. :)  When I started the game, I used an Eagle, and stuck with it for AGES. Dumped every credit I earned back into better equipment. Experimented with a bunch of different loadouts until I found one that worked for me (dual gimballed beam lazers on the low points, gimballed cannon on the high point).  I got my flight experience by interdicting targets out of supercruise. It guarantees a 1v1 fight. I started out on Sidewinders, Eagles, Adders, Haulers, and Cobras. Eventually I graduated to Vipers and Asps. Once I got my Eagle fully tricked out, I was even able to take down a Python if it started the battle unshielded.  I found that the interdiction-from-super-cruise method worked best for me when I was still learning, because it guaranteed that I could pick battles based on ships I actually thought I could take on.  It was slow going for credits per hour, but greatly reduced the steep learning curve.  Vipers are superior to Eagles, but they take more skill to master. Eagles are easier to dogfight with, as there's pretty much nothing in the game that can out maneuver them when it comes to turn radius. Some gimballed weapons in an Eagle makes combat against NPC's trivial.  Of course, try that shit on my Diamondback and I'll chaff, reverse thrust, and blast you into oblivion. But against PvE it's quite fun.  So my advice would be to consider downgrading to an Eagle and focusing on PvE interdiction-based bounty hunting for income. Once your ship's halfway decent, equip a fuel scoop and head over to Fed space to do undermining by essentially doing the exact same play style pattern on NPC Federal Couriers.  Once you get your skill level up and get more of a feel for the game, then move on to bigger ships that take a little bit more skill to fly well in combat."

I do not want another Cartoi but we can't cave in to them over and over again.  Their argument seems to be 'you can expand everywhere, we are boxed in'. Which has some sense to it but doesn't really stand up when we're the ones being expected to compromise without any reward each time."

UGP 120 is worth 129CC, but we may be able to get two systems worth 90-100 each.  Once Hip 21778 is expanded (after next cycle, its currently getting prepped) I think expanding to that area will be easier. Systems that far away may be hard to keep on our top 10 list.   I agree with him on a system that seemed so far out last night, but if it does link up with HIP 21778 and Vodyanes, then maybe it is worthwhile to get one system up here. Again, though, it might be worth trying to space them out to find the sweet spot for two 100cc spheres, rather than one 120cc sphere."

There's only one system overlap so it won't make a significant difference to the CC, and HIP 35246 doesn't cover Gally Bese so it leaves it open to be taken and significantly weaken the link.

EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,McFergus,3,Wed Jun 17 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"I just want to remind everybody that we don't really need (or probably want) to link up with FOS Guardian. The whole purpose of it being a single red cape to the uncoordinated enemy factions to undermine. Also it will be quite difficult to prep them every week and most people will prep in order from distance to HQ.  Not saying it shouldn't be up for discussion either way.  Also we should only factor in CC, landing pad size, government, distance from star, distance from HQ, and overlap (our own and other factions) when deciding systems. We get absolutely no benefit from capturing systems with good outfitting, shipyards, mining, ect. (and I'm sure we have a wealth of good bounty hunting systems already).  Unless I've missed something and am just completely wrong."
EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,jgmcdee,2,Wed Jun 17 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"You are right with the things that matter, and we don't need to link up with Pancienses, but it could easily be surrounded and it's income drastically cut. Hell, that will likely happen even if we do link up to it.  We don't benefit from great outfitting, but I think players are concerned that if the Imperial game of thrones winds up turning hostile, we won't have access to good outfitting or shipyards. Personally, I'm not, as I think Open Conflicts will be handled differently to PowerPlay, but we can't know that for sure."
EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,Darshendros,2,Wed Jun 17 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"Another suggestion last week that we didn’t get to was from /u/Darshendros and checking the map again, we probably should’ve gotten to it this week. The idea is to shore up our border with Patreus so that we don’t get Contested Systems that piss both of us off. We already have one situation like this in Vaka, so we should do our best to avoid a repeat.  His suggestion was Cockaigne:   98CC Expansion cost. 35 CC potential income. 2 high tech systems (Cockaigne and Meliontit; Meliontit also has C3 gimballed beams) Rides up on Patreus' border, close to his HQ.  There might be one contested system with Baal, but it's a prison colony and pretty low income, so it should be acceptable. Cockaigne also has a couple RES, but I haven't tried them out yet. Shipyard's pretty standard. Not sure about Meliontit's, but there are more high techs around Baal, so you can pretty much get all the modules you need for any ship between them.   Of course, Patreus will most likely be expanding into CF 646 next cycle (tomorrow).  Unfortunately, that would allow them to exploit both Gender and Delta Phoenicis. Sorry we didn’t listen to you earlier, Darshendros. Thankfully, there are a few systems around there which can allow us to exploit both Cockaigne and Meliontit with a profit. Though, as always, researchers to check out the stations and shipyards involved would be appreciated. Reply with your findings, please.  Cockaigne   35cc - as Gender will be contested, it would be less. Dictatorship 58Ly from HQ High Tech/Extraction Drive Performance Specialists are based in Cockaigne: ‘For the ultimate performance.’   Lombi   40cc - again, Delta Phoenicis and Gender would be contested, so the cc would be less. Dictatorship 61Ly from HQ IndustrialExtraction   Sibil   37cc - no systems to become contested here, and we exploit Cockaigne and Meliontit, so this might be the best option. Patronage 49Ly from HQ Extraction/Refinery   I forgot to check, but hopefully this shores up Baal's Sphere of Influence from any outside Contest? Baal currently is our highest income Control system, so we should keep it safe."
EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,Darshendros,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:59:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Sibil would probably be a better option then.   EDIT: Wait. No, I just checked Sibil out. It's right on the border of Baal's sphere and would affect its income. Meliontit, on the other hand, would have no contested systems with Baal or CF 646 (if Patreus' people are indeed going to prep that). Otherwise, sticking with Cockaigne.  Actually, yeah, just gonna stick to Cockaigne."
EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,Darshendros,2,Wed Jun 17 09:40:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that Cockaigne ,looks like the best option down there.  I doubt Patreus will try anything, but its an option if he does."
EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:28:54 2015 UTC,Just taken a look at this.  I think that we should ignore it unless Patreus makes a move towards us here.
EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,McFergus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair, if we share a sphere of influence with another control system of ours, it does no affect either income. The potential profit factors around the systems we already control, that's why Yab Camalo had such a low potential profit, because we already had control of half of its sphere of influence. It doesn't affect Igal's income. And the 37 potential profit is accurate, as it's factoring for that system's expansion. That said Cockaigne will probably be about 30 subtracting Gender and I didn't bother looking at Meliontit.  But that's why all three of those options are on here, because the choice needs to be made. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they start prepping Cockaigne soon."
EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,jgmcdee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:32:21 2015 UTC,Really? I had assumed the income was split if they were in overlapping spheres of influence. Weird.

EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,jgmcdee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Ah. That makes sense too.   I'm going to say prep Cockaigne for now (if it makes the list), but switch to Sibil if Patreus starts prepping CF 646 so there's no contested systems between us."

EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,jgmcdee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:27:44 2015 UTC,This does bring up the question of what to do about Patreus' expansion in to Wangal.  Given his direction so far I'd be more inclined to take Lhou Ling than Zemetii.
EliteLavigny,3a4xlh,McFergus,2,Wed Jun 17 19:13:43 2015 UTC,"Another couple systems /u/McFergus brings to our attention are on our borders on the other side, ideally we expand here now, so Aisling supporters don’t expand here in two weeks.  Kalivunian and Damooria   These systems are next to each other so can only have one. Kalivunian is worth 11CC less, but it is Patronage (easier expansion and fortifying) and has a closer station.   Kalivunian   79cc Patronage 87Ly from HQ Extraction/Industrial   Damooria   90cc Corporate 86Ly from HQ Industrial   McFergus has recommended both in the past week. so I’ll let him reply with his research and recommendation for this week."

EliteLavigny,3a08pa,aspiringexpatriate,2,Tue Jun 16 06:29:16 2015 UTC,The only way to protect a system is to ensure that there are no systems within a 15ly radius which are available for expansion by another power.

Any systems within that radius are considered exploited, and give us the bonuses, as well as command credits.

If you visit the site one thing I am looking for on the recruitment section is diplomats, I want to have members assigned to coordinating, almost running, with other groups and powers, staying in communication and being a constant representation of my group active in the community. Before I defected, I was very much all about politics when I was an Aisling supporter, I intend to keep up my track record!  This doesn't mean to say however that other aspects will be ignored! I am just saying I'd like to focus on lines of communication, like at the moment, we are following and I am advising all my associates and members to follow the standing orders on this reddit for the time being, and we shall until it otherwise changes.

EliteLavigny,39x7fm,AYKP,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly! If they would permit us and accept our diplomats, they would basically be similar to our own honorary members that we have, they would work with that group and communicate with them, and then feed it back to the main group.  Regarding command structure it is a work in progress, a mate of mine and I are planning custom logos for different ranks, and if numbers grow, sub-divisional ranks will be a thing too!

EliteLavigny,39x7fm,GlendonHawke,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"Well I'd hope to have an American branch as-well, I wouldn't like to just have active hours! Part of why I am looking for more senior staff members is so I can run a fully active group all the time pretty much, I assume primarily we will be EU based, but our American members can co-ordinate with us on weekends for full operations, and with summer just coming up I don't believe timezones will be much of an issue, as most will be up till all hours anyway! :)"
EliteLavigny,39x7fm,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"True that. I mean, I won't be up all hours because I would prefer to not feel like a zombie at work.  Still, mentioning that you're EU-based in your recruitment might be helpful. On the sidebar, for example, people could look at the list and get an idea of what group to join.  I'd love to help out.

Don't abandon commitments if you have them as they stand, but yeah, if you want to help out I can award you an honorary title within the group, so when you do help out, you will benefit from that rank, any help I can get right now is incredibly useful! :)"

EliteLavigny,39x7fm,Yan-Isleth,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:22:12 2015 UTC,"I found that the intransigence of the power's inability to use and seize the political leverage it commanded in order to further it's agenda unproductive.   They seemed all to be very passive about their aims, and I got the feeling from many that they had this vision of just fortifying themselves up, not concerning themselves with anyone else or protecting imperial interests, which I think are things they should have been doing.  I also have a friend in this Power, who convinced me to defect as he had earlier done so, there was even talk in Aisling's supporters who I talked to talked of defection to Arissa and in my opinion I took the initiative.  The groups currently operating around here are stronger, seem to be interested in galactic affairs and aren't afraid to act when courage is required!  ... and I am proud to now be serving alongside them all! :)"

EliteLavigny,39wfxc,DMHawker,3,Mon Jun 15 10:31:50 2015 UTC,"Of course members on reddit are only a small minority compared to the total numbers of Commanders pledged in the game   Isn't that a huge flaw that would render the data mostly useless? I'm not sure if it's true, but there has long since been talk about the alleged contradiction of the Federation being the most numerous major faction in-game, but for whatever reason underrepresented on reddit.  I mean, going by the numbers above, the Federation as a whole has barely more players than the Alliance, which can't be right. Sure, there's some merit in tracking growth alone, but even those numbers could be heavily skewed due to the low amount of newcomers on the sub."
EliteLavigny,39wfxc,akashisenpai,2,Mon Jun 15 14:38:43 2015 UTC,"Yep you're absolutely right.  But, there is an important distinction to make.  Hudson being in 1st Position is about the number of systems he controls and the value of those systems, not the number of Commanders that have pledged to him.  Which is kind of borne out by the fact that most of the time every single Hudson Control System is undermined but very few of ours are, in contrast our systems are almost always fully fortified way before theirs are.  It's certainly not proof that they have less Commanders than we do, there are lots of other factors in play, but it is fun to speculate."
EliteLavigny,39wfxc,akashisenpai,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:50:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, I had not noticed that Hudson is so ... defenseless. I must admit I'm surprised, even though I've of course been aware that right now the 1st position is really just the Power's ""starting value"", reflecting the territories they had when they joined PP.  I'm sure the galaxy will look very different a few months from now, I just did not expect things to look that grim for him!  Your description makes me wonder whether it could be possible to gain a better understanding of a Power's ""potential"" if we would judge it based on how strong their Fortifications are, or how much they try to Undermine? I imagine it'd be a lot harder to keep track of, and still does not allow a good guess of member numbers - but on the other hand, it would yield that faction's effective strength, as in including the ability or inability of its members to understand how PP actually works (or whether they're just grinding Merits without caring for the consequences).  Oh, and thanks for the chart anyways! I'm not yet sure how useful it will really be, but I enjoy such analysis either way, and you gotta start somewhere."

In a few weeks the increase (or decrease) rate will be very interesting."
EliteLavigny,39yyze,DarkWorlds_Foxy,7,Mon Jun 15 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to ignorance.  Kamadhenu is at the border of AL-D space. For whatever reason, most of the space around HQ is uncontrolled. Hypothetically it would be vulnerable to Patreus expansion attempts, and so capturing Gauthiti would start to seal off our HQ from direct undermining and opposition.  A quick look at the bizarre state of the Torval HQ, Synteini, would quickly disprove this strategy, but the Powers have a bad habit of not checking out rival borders and their current situation.  Further to this, the data and experience of commanders I've read on this issue suggest that the poor quality systems in our prep queue are attractive to traders or simply convenient; Gauthiti is the most convenient system to hand merits into around HQ to grind merit rating.  Never underestimate the power of laziness. Right now the powers all have enough to worry about establishing and securing their own borders, and people are still learning how exactly all this stuff works."

If they try and prepare a system near our base, we'll have three options: A) counter their prep in an all out war of attrition, twice as worse as Cartoi was, because this week our number 6 is over 20thousand strong. B) Let them prep but counter their expansion, which will be more like situation normal for us, anyways. C) Let them expand into a system near Pancienses and just pester and undermine everything there.  A would get us in trouble, as we're already neck deep in preparation insanity, so I'd recommend against this. B would be almost exactly what we've done to Winters the whole time, just more intense. C would be interesting, but the game so far isn't built to fully explore the horrors of the controlled spheres, or we haven't figured out how to exploit it yet."

EliteLavigny,39zb0c,RemyGreaves,3,Tue Jun 16 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but what lore are you referring to? Why do you feel an alliance of Imperial powers means we are sacrificing the rich store and history of Elite?   I've read most of the canon (and non-canon Oolite fiction). The Empire has always put up an united front against the Federation. Whatever Imperial infighting has taken place never changes the Empire's hatred of the Fed, or their combining of resources. Nothing unites foes faster than a common enemy. This dates back to the founding Duvals, and the believed (in some circles) assassination of Marlin Duval (founder of the Empire) by Fed agents.   I don't see an alliance as a violation of that. It's the Fed players' issue to figure out how to coordinate between Hudson and Winters. I also don't feel any driving need to 'help' FD's developers by intentionally putting ourselves into a state of war/weakness. If the FD developers need us to blow ourselves up, they are doing something wrong and I should go back to a neutral status and quit PP."

This combined with the numbers advantage held by Empire makes the Fed vs. Empire history look like David vs Goliath (where we are Goliath).  Seems like it should be a lot more even than it currently is.    I joined Lavigny thinking we were going to be somewhat underdogs (evidently my mistake) and instead we are by far the strongest power.  It seems like most people in here agree with your side anyways, thus the status quo shall remain.    I think it will be a sad day when the Fed are wiped from the Galaxy and then we are left with only memories of the 1000s of years that came before.  Maybe it is presumptive of me to expect Feds will roll over so quickly, but it just looks like 2 months from now people will be saying Hudson, who?  Winters? what?"
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:47:03 2015 UTC,"Arissa is snagging a system that Patreus specifically asked for, for one.  And I don't think anyone will mourn the Feds."
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,AYKP,0,Tue Jun 16 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"Hey, we ""tried"". Or rather, we argued and screamed, but didn't actually do anything to stop it.  I imagine a Patreus rallying cry will be ""remember Vaka!"" and it will all soon go to hell without our direct intention."
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:21:47 2015 UTC,"What were we supposed to do, open fire on the EDC to stop them?  If anything, we were just as surprised as Patreus's pilots were when EDC flipped it."

EliteLavigny,39zb0c,Top8anana,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:04:38 2015 UTC,"I knew the ""People's"" Princess would be a logistical underdog, but I also thought Senator Duval would be an underdog. That appears to have been faulty logic in an empire built on Feudal and Patronage systems. Hell, I'm pretty sure the Lavigny family has always been well loved, too. Patreus is an upstart who rewards his followers well. Senator Torval? She is a long established senator and successful businesswoman with a massive power-base."
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,NEM3S1S,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:24:02 2015 UTC,I think give it a few more weeks and the faction hoping people (the ones after the faction modules) will leave and then lets see what state we are in
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,rossitrias,2,Tue Jun 16 12:01:19 2015 UTC,"The alliance that has been in effect for all of three days? Slow down there, turbo. Let's knock out the Feds first, then we can worry about ensuring our sovereignty in the Empire."
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,NEM3S1S,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:52:36 2015 UTC,"I think you counter your own point sir, the alliance is very fragile and full of plenty of people who would see us die. The fact it has existed for a mere 3 days demonstrates the fact that we need to work on creating and preserving the imperial eco-system.  Going all out against the Federation and having this absolute attitude towards their ultimate destruction is not a very good diplomatic stance and not very good foreign policy considering internal/domestic affairs are very fragile at the moment. Sovereignty is something we should be debating and discussing, not the end times of the Federation just yet."
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,AYKP,0,Tue Jun 16 01:16:45 2015 UTC,I know it is early days for the alliance but I think the sheer numbers we hold in the Empire just makes it a forgone conclusion that the Feds will get too wrecked to recover. I don't want them to win. I just want to give FDEV time to even some of the playing field.
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:13:29 2015 UTC,"Since when has accommodating the devs ever been an enjoyable activity in any game? Eff that, we will play the way we want. ""Even the playing field"", give me a break."
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,AYKP,0,Tue Jun 16 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"Fair commentary.  I'm not here to pick a fight, just give my 2 cents. The game is still young but the history is vast, perhaps I'm an idealist and would like to see a more drawn out fight with Fed powers.    I do agree that accommodating the Devs isn't ideal, but doing so for a little while so they can help balance the game isnt a terrible idea."
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,CMDR_Corrigendum,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"Nope. Nope, nope, nope, and a side order of more nope.  We don't have the resources for infighting, too many borders to protect, and we'd lose more than we'd gain by challenging any of the other empire powers. Cartoi proved this.  Personally, I'm more interested to see what FDev does when empire control systems start encroaching on Sol. Do they start deploying Fed cap ships to stop us? Or Thargoids?"
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,aspiringexpatriate,2,Tue Jun 16 00:31:54 2015 UTC,I'd have to throw in my lot here. I also suspect that the Emporer's death may see an end to the Imperial truce. Open war may then greet you with open arms.
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,gumbosis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:43:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at this point I'm expecting some form of FDev ""backstab"" for the Lavigny forces, forcing us to retreat from the Pancienses campaign, but I'm not sure how yet.  As for the emperor (Bask in this greatness, long may he reign), I doubt open war would be enough for the Imperial player-base to turn on each other - for easy merit farming, sure, but not enough to justify changing our overall strategic plans.  We earn more CC expanding into open space towards the Feds than we do heading towards each other. Until that changes, the Empire remains united."

EliteLavigny,39zb0c,rossitrias,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:26:26 2015 UTC,It's not a matter of if but when. Michael Brookes will produce the emperor's body there will be a split empire and rivers of blood.
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,aspiringexpatriate,-2,Tue Jun 16 02:51:35 2015 UTC,some challenge is better than no challenge.  we will run uncontested until it is too late and then it will be too far gone to bring the Feds back.  this is my fear.
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,aspiringexpatriate,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:36:42 2015 UTC,Go fight for the feds then if you want them to do well. Once the feds are no longer a threat i will guarantee that there will be infighting amongst the imperial factions.
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,rossitrias,0,Tue Jun 16 00:46:28 2015 UTC,You don't get my point. This 1000+ year struggle is not meant to get dominated so quickly by the Empire. I just want to see a more even playing field and think part of that would come from the alliance being broken. Certainly the Feds would still have an uphill battle but it might save the lore and story from irrevocable harm.
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,rossitrias,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:15:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think PowerPlay works the way you think it does. A smaller, contained power that is still powerful can easily recover from setbacks and stagnation. A Power that is over-stretched and has to defend itself from all sides after some change of event, will suffer huge setbacks.  Remember, it is the highest upkeep systems that enter Turmoil first, not the most far flung."
EliteLavigny,39zb0c,rbstewart7263,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"I would like to offer a few words on the matter:  -Imperial powers would unite against us I believe, right now, we are big enough so they envy our power and to provoke one of them would provoke all of them, I don't think fighting them and the Federation would be strategically or politically sound.   To further expand on that point, if we were to attack other Imperial Powers, it would have to be targeted at a very specific one, one at a time, which in the aforementioned point, is not really possible in the current state of affairs. The passionate belief in the Empire. Yes, I'm a patriot. I believe that what makes us distinctive is our variety of ideologies, ranks and dispositions within a broad but yet still united Empire. It is almost like an eco-system, not enough diversity means that it will just become stagnant and stale, and we will more than likely lose momentum, power and people alongside those effects. The legal implications. With an uncertain succession in the Empire, now would not be the time to provoke imperial disillusion with a potential heir, as it would easily bolster support for Aisling/her father which I'm not saying would be bad, but it would certainly weaken/undermine our situation politically on a galactic stage, we would no longer be the leading influence in the Empire, a status, we comfortably enjoy for now.   Any counter-points to what I said I'd be happy to answer, otherwise, those are my thoughts! :)"

Don't even bother with class 1 - it's faster to just dock at a station. Put a class 1 fuel tank on it, if you don't know what to do with the 2nd class 1. (1st shoud be interdictor imho.)  Just plot your route, select a system with a station at your maximum range, buy fuel and go on. You should only need 2-3 tank stops to Fed space."
