Then I realized for him race didn't matter, because all he was worried about was guys getting so drunk they'd piss in the closets.  He was tired of having to pull up the floors because they were warped with piss.    Interesting fact: humans are disgusting.  Black people are disgusting, white people are also disgusting.

GNV,3e5ruu,trycat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:32:55 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. In Gainesville, ""renter"" is often used as code for ""student"" or ""poor person"" as if neither is a group that should be taken into consideration and/or is undesirable (even if there are a lot of renters who are neither students nor poor). My experiences with the city plan board and commission have definitely illustrated this well - we can have horrible developments or activities in residential areas because they are ""only renters"" next door. People proposing terrible projects will actually say this at meetings. I've also heard areas with high concentrations of renters referred to as commercial - income-generating is not the same thing as commercial, residential neighborhoods are residential, whether the people living there rent or own. One of my favorites is when people like to pretend that renters don't contribute to property taxes - those rental properties are not eligible for the homestead tax exemption (so, homeowner who lives in your own house, you're probably paying less property taxes than a renter in a home of the same value), and it's silly to pretend that the property taxes aren't being passed along to the renter in the form of rent.  By the way, if you rent and you feel this way, consider getting involved on one of the city's citizen advisory boards. There are very few, if any, renters on many of these boards. Same goes for people who commute via bike or bus to work or school (or even use the bus at all) - seriously underrepresented on most of the boards."

GNV,3dys5f,dieDoktor,9,Tue Jul 21 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"Full-story text:  Grooveshark co-founder Josh Greenberg, a pioneer in Gainesville’s student startup movement, was found dead in his bed Sunday by his girlfriend in the apartment they shared. He was 28.  Lori Greenberg, his mother, said Monday he had no health problems and she was told by police who investigated Sunday night that there was no evidence of foul play, injuries or drugs.  She said her son was more relieved than depressed about the settlement that shut down Grooveshark on April 30 since it ended the lawsuit that had been hanging over his head. Several record companies had sued the online music streaming service over copyright violations.  “He was excited about potential new things that he was going to start,” she said.  The medical examiner was performing an autopsy Monday morning and would know if there were obvious problems with Greenberg’s heart or brain, otherwise, toxicology results would be done in two or three months, Lori Greenberg said.  “They are as baffled as I am,” she said.  Josh Greenberg’s girlfriend, Abby Mayer, returned from vacation to find his body.  Lori Greenberg said he was lying on his back with his eyes closed and a comforter halfway over his body.  “It looked like he was sleeping,” she said.  Greenberg and Sam Tarantino founded Grooveshark as 19-year-old freshmen at the University of Florida in March 2006. At its peak, the company had up to 40 million users a month and 145 employees, occupying most of the second floor of the Union Street Station in downtown Gainesville and a small office in New York City.  Greenberg helped train other entrepreneurs and computer programmers to get their start in the tech industry through Grooveshark University classes, the Summer with the Sharks internship program and as a partner in the Founders Pad business incubator.  He started MaidSuite with Student Maid founder Kristen Hadeed to provide an online scheduling application for cleaning companies and other service providers and recently helped start the Gainesville Dev Academy to offer computer programming training. He was a founding member of the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce’s Gainesville Technology Council.  In addition to his mother, Greenberg is survived by his younger brother, Jacob, and grandparents, Jerry and Sandy Greenberg. Lori Greenberg, who lives in St. Petersburg, said Josh’s friends would be arranging a memorial service in Gainesville.    Very sad. He helped out a lot of local entrepreneurs and seemed like a great guy."

GNV,3e0rdi,AxeEffect3890,7,Tue Jul 21 03:00:06 2015 UTC,"Personally I would not. But only because I live right next to a grocery store and my fiancée plans our shopping trips meticulously.   I know the service exists in a few markets, and one of my concerns would be whether Gainesville is the right market for this business.   One pro is that starting the business would be fairly cheap. You incur almost no costs until you get orders. The only upfront cost would be the website or app.   I  feel the main hurdle would be getting a GOOD website. This is where you would have to set yourself apart from the rest of the compitition.   I’m heading to bed for the night but if you’re in the market for another idea guy as well as someone who knows his way around a balance sheet, let me know."

GNV,3e0rdi,TheWashKing,2,Wed Jul 22 03:14:46 2015 UTC,"That's great. But none of those companies are explicitly here asking for your input, either. By no means do I believe every person ever employed anywhere needs to use, or even believe in the services or product their company provides.   But let's not pretend there's a not a huge difference between getting a job for a large biotech firm and scraping in the startup world trying to build a product you believe in. Trying to convince others to see its value. You may never have a degenerative eye condition, but you do use groceries. Weekly at least. And if you don't burn the fire of what you're trying to make, it is probably not the best fit.   To quote one of my favorite people in Gainesville, one of the most brilliant entrepreneurial minds we had, We are the market. We know what we want.   I had also just sent op a pm before receiving this and thought his response was a pm, to explain the weird heading to bed part.   That part makes more sense now."
GNV,3e0rdi,shnnrr,2,Wed Jul 22 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"Would this be for one specific chain or any grocery store in town? Like I want stuff from Ward's, for example. Cataloging the sheer amount of groceries in my mind would be really tough but maybe things like barcode scanner apps could be tapped for info... Streamlining the service, too, so its not like ordering a pizza but a system of timed deliveries that could be set up?

I thought I saw another grocery delivery service in town a few months ago, maybe Grocery Mama?  I don't personally know anyone who I think would be likely to take advantage of this service. My husband and I both like cooking, and we both like going to the grocery store. I'd say most of the folks we know in town are either the same way or would be too cheap to pay someone else to do it.   This is not to say there is no market for it; I'm thinking students perhaps, but it really depends on whether students without a car are going to be the subset willing/able to pay extra rather than taking the bus or biking. Or perhaps those with a car who don't want the bother but have the extra cash?"

The newspaper article says they were only doing 100 deliveries per week after being in business for three months. Did they not have enough start-up capital to enable them to advertise properly, or is there just not much demand for this kind of service even if it were advertised very cleverly?"
GNV,3e0rdi,GmPryb,2,Tue Jul 21 11:27:11 2015 UTC,"I finally figured out that their pricing was $13 per 10 items delivered. That means if I had a Publix list with 20 items on it, it'd be $26 on top of whatever the regular cost is. That's ludicrous.   What's even more ludicrous is how I figured it out:    Hey I've heard about this neat new grocery delivery service in town. Let me Google it and.. oh, going to the site from Google gives you a scary warning.  Anyway, I'll ignore Google (LOL) and proceed anyway. On their homepage, cool! I see a bunch of store logos. I guess that's where they deliver from. Well, I need stuff from Fresh Market so I'll click on that and it... enlarges itself? This takes you nowhere. It's a little confusing and entirely useless.  Finally, when (if) I decide to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, only then might you finally notice the option to actually PLACE AN ORDER. Like, underneath their gigantic ""Follow us on Twitter"" button? Really?  OK, so I'll bite. Now I can start loading up my cart before checkout, right? Wrong. Now you have to register before even seeing what this service offers.  Alright, alright. I've heard really great things about these guys so I guess I'll commit. Wow, the registration form only has 3 fields! That's easy and awesome! Oh wait.. once I started putting in my email address, a bunch of other fields appeared out of nowhere--all in the red as if I had submitted without completing them. It's telling me there was an error, but I haven't even touched the submit button yet.  This form is just doing everything it can to deter me, but somehow I persevered! That's right, as a busy mother I managed to figure out all this complicated fuckery and registered! Now I can get on with my shopping... once.. I.. login again?    tl;dr I figured out what their fucking problem was."

I don't see how you could keep number of items in stock up to date, without tapping into a particular stores perpetual inventory system.  Feedback: I would not be interested in using the service."
GNV,3e0rdi,ToTheHQ,3,Tue Jul 21 12:01:47 2015 UTC,The website and app would be created exclusively for one grocery chain here in Gainesville.   Eh... Running to a single store is no problem. The only way I'd use this would be to save me from running to TJ's then heading over to Fresh market and Northwest seafood before jumping over to Lucky's and Ward's then at the Asian market on 34th before Publix to pick up anything else I missed.
GNV,3e0rdi,TheWashKing,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:42 2015 UTC,This is not a service I would use. I would guess 75% of the groceries I buy on any given trip are completely based on price and what is on sale.
GNV,3e0rdi,amgolf,2,Tue Jul 21 23:34:38 2015 UTC,"If the price is right, absolutely.   It has to be per trip, not per item. Sure, have some safeguards in there so people can't load up 100 things with impunity, but for an average shop there needs to be one, flat per-trip fee.   Go for the weekly/recurring customer. You're never going to be able to compete or reliably scale on a per-item/casual shop basis. Have it in there? Sure, some drunks/college kids/others will pay $15 for a single item in a pinch but that's not a business model and I just don't see the on-demand as being the core. Offer it, if you can make it work, but I wouldn't make that my focus.   Some people have mentioned that they would use a ""multiple store"" shopping service to save time. That's OK. They are not your (initial) customer target. Depending on price, you'll be surprised how many people you can convert entirely. Or at the very least demonstrate that cutting out one of their multiple-store visits is making their life 50% more convenient rather than 100%.  It has to be competitive not just on the laziness/convenience factor, but with the Uber mentality too. If I could Uber to the store and back for relatively the same cost as a delivery, that's a huge mental hurdle for a new digital service."

I live in a 3/3, but our friends live in a two bedroom. Both of our overrages are in the 200s. Our last bill was 226. Keep in mind all three of us are full time and go to school as well, so it baffles me they are this high.  Also, they are increasing prices. Our 3/3 was about 1050 when we moved in, this was without utilies and this was three years ago. It is now 1260. Beware.  When you move in, make sure. I repeat, MAKE SURE, when they try and charge you something that you have them show you what for. I have had to do this four times the last few months for bogus charges."

I've never had a problem with staff (only a neighbor, which was resolved), and I've been here 2 years with a dog.

I actually have a problem with some of the food quality in town. Burrito Brothers. I'm looking at you.   Menus.  Many people are getting old and have glasses. Make your menus simpler and larger type. Chalkboard menus are hard to read in some cases. They usually don't get updated either because the person with good writing was fired for selling come from the kitchen.   Parking.  During the big towing kerfuffle a couple of years ago it seems to me that businesses have an interest in keeping parking notices clear and towing companies at bay. A few places I won't go to because the towing signs changed often as if they wanted to nab you. It's in your interest to keep your customers from getting towed.   Don't get political.  I saw this in college station Texas:  signs in businesses had signs in the windows sharing political views. Thank god I don't see that here but I'm afraid 2016 could start that.

GNV,3devoj,Lilusa,3,Wed Jul 15 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"For 360 and PS3 repairs we ship them off to our Tampa location.   I don't know of anyone doing professional console repairs in Gainesville. ReTech used to do it, then they sold their equipment to Gamers HQ. UBreakIFix was doing them for a couple months and then stopped. HQ closed in April, just leaving the Craigslist people.  From talking to a few different people who tried it, console repairs was 10% of revenue and 90% of customer complaints. Most consoles don't make it through the repair warranty. (We are talking YLOD and RROD repairs not a disc tray repair like OP). The second problem was the scarcity for cheap parts. If BR drives cost you $50, a $90 repair is a thin margin after labor and the time spent."

Gator Bev is featured in the LTJ - Gainesville Rock City video. They're playing in the front parking lot next to Modern Age. Check it out. Located on University.  In front of where Boca Fiesta now is in the Sun Center downtown is where they played there first show, also featured in the LTJ - Gville Rock City video. Neato, huh?  And last but not least from the Gainesville Rock City video, Smoke, the old head shop Roger doesn't remember working at. It is now Kava Hookah Lounge next to Gyro Plus on University Ave.  Moving on...  High Dive is where they play all their shows in Gainesville. It was formerly the Covered Dish when they started playing there, and since then it's been Common Grounds, Double Down, and now High Dive. Anyway, I must've seen them there 10 times. But even cooler, they sometimes hang out there for other shows if they're in town. I've seen Buddy and Chris there for an Easy Star All-Stars show, and Roger for a Morning Fatty show. That was probably complete luck, but who knows.  Speaking of Roger, his record label and recording studio are here in town. Doubt they're offering free tours but maybe you could drive by with your friend...? It's called Moathouse Records.   That's all I've got for now. Have fun."

This was the cost for 2 people living in the one bedroom apartment (about 700 square feet).  The activation fee was $60, and they waived the $160 security fee because I chose to pay automatically from my checking account each month. High usage (hottest part of the summer and coldest part of the winter) was about $200 per month, and low usage was about $150 per month.

It's a new bar/arcade on University Ave just east of Main St. It's three stories of old-school arcade games, and it's a bar. It's a fun crowd and a good time. For a quieter experience, the bar next door to it, called the Dime, makes some great drinks and has a cool atmosphere.  If you're looking for a more casual place to eat, Mojo BBQ downtown is very good, as is Wholly BBQ. My personal cheap-eat favorite is Sababa (in the Sun Center a few doors down from Maude's), which serves the best falafel in Gainesville.

Next to Pop-a-Top is the Dime, and next to that is Barcade. All are owned by the people who own the Top/the Wooly, etc. (Pop-a-Top is pretty cool too...little corner store with good snacks.)  Also, I'm a vegetarian, so I haven't tried either BBQ place, but I have heard great things about both, and I was forced to go to Wholly BBQ (which is next to what used to be the Common Grounds when you lived here) for a friend's band that was playing there, and the smells emanating from that place had me reconsidering my no-animals diet. :P Mojo costs a little more and is a small Florida chain, but I hear their stuff is incredible too.

Combined with last month being pretty hot, I would suspect a lot of people are seeing utility bills that look pretty crazy.  In general you can do some stuff to try and improve insulation, but apartments can be pretty limiting to what you can actually do that would be really useful. Getting the AC checked to make sure it's running efficiently is probably a good start if you can get your landlord to pony up the cash to do so."

It seems like this change will most likely affect families or households with a large number of people, but if you're a one- or two-person household, you probably won't see an increase.  To see an increase on your natural-gas bill, you'd have to use 25 therms or more per billing cycle. I own a 1,500-SF house, and the only time I reached that number was this past February. Usually, we use between 6 to 10 therms. (We have a gas stove, heater, and very old water heater.)  To see an increase on your water bill, you'd have to use over 7,000 gallons per billing cycle. Our two-person household uses 4,000 gallons on average.  I can't speak for wastewater because we have septic, but again, you'd have to use over 7,000 gallons to see an increase.  Thankfully, there is no proposed increase for electric usage, but the tier structure may change."
GNV,3cls8l,carlidew,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:46:40 2015 UTC,"Title is correct. The example of 7000 gallons was an illustrative set. The base rate for water and wastewater is going up for all usage. If you use 7000 gallons, your expected increase would b 3.35 (for water/wastewater). If you use less, you will still see an increase.   The electric rate tiers will happen. Most people in the service area will see an increased monthly cost.   Gas again is based on an illustrative example. The rate increase will apply to all usage.   If you use water, you will pay more.   If you use has, you will pay more.   If you use electricity, you will very likely pay more.   If you are a business, you'll pay the same electrical as now (high increases over the last 2 years) and your water and gas will go up."

A business using 30KW/month would save over $3,600.00/year in Ocala, $2,400/year in Alachua, $5,400/year in Winter Park, $5,000/year in South Florida, etc...

These days every adventuring spot has been paved over and turned into a neighborhood. There used to be giant dirt hills to climb, and a sink hole with a rope swing way back in the woods. There are still plenty of trails, but they tore down most of the playgrounds so you can't even sit on a swing anymore.     First of all, avoid the commoner's footpath. That is the public access trail that runs long the north side of Haile Boulevard. You want to show that you are a person of class and distinction, so use the trails that are reserved for residents and guests, which are all of them. The county put in this path to allow common criminals access to Haile without fear of being arrested for trespassing, as way to punish the rich people of Haile. But like most measures designed to punish the rich, it mostly affects the middle class as the path is no where near the rich neighborhoods like India Station or William Kent Court, but runs though Old Haile where the middle class homes are."

I've had it before, sometimes it happens even to people with good teeth, if you get dry mouth a lot or don't brush gums enough or something. You should go to the dentist and get a thorough cleaning but in the meantime there's stuff you can do, and if your case isn't that bad you might be able to heal it in your own. Switch to a soft toothbrush and brush your teeth 3 times a day. Buy a pack of those disposable flossers (the ones with the dental picks) and use those once a day. Buy 3% hydrogen peroxide, mix with water, and swish it around like mouthwash for 30 secs a day. For me this was the most important... Listerine and all that didn't do shit, I didn't start getting better till I used hydrogen peroxide. Again, still a good idea to dentist once you can, but this should hold you over till then."

Example: Last time I was in there a person who was dealing with an issue where a store double charged her.  One of the tellers printed out her bank statements and went to the store with her to get it sorted out.  Since it would take a few days for the charges to clear vystar ""loaned"" her the missing money until it all cleared so that she would have money for gas/groceries.

Have you considered a bank? I know, banks are evil. However, I would encourage you to check out Ally Bank. They have the best rates I could find when I was looking to switch banks a few years ago, and they are 100% online and offer an outstanding web and mobile experience. I can cash a check from my phone, send money to people (even those not at Ally) for free, etc. Customer service is excellent. They don't have any brick-and-mortar locations (which is why they offer excellent rates), but you can use any ATM anywhere and they will reimburse you any ATM fees at the end of the month. It's worth CHECKING out (haha, pun intended!). I have two savings accounts and a checking account with them, and they also offer CDs and money-market accounts, I believe.  And, with Ally, if you move out of FL/GNV, you don't have to move your money to your next location, so you'll never have this conundrum again!"

I have a big bank for my daily use but I love Campus for their financing rates.  I'm sure you got your mortgage with them for good reason and IMHO it's worth keeping an account with them (or another CU) for future loans.  I actually like my big bank but my account has been under several companies that were all acquisitions.  Ally is just like any other bank in that regards.

The people that are doing the actual research (in this particular lab) are really chill grad students or alumni from other schools that have happily happened upon the McGuire Center.   In the front like working in the shops and things, I usually see student-age people. Typically the docents are retirees and over the summer there are some high-schoolers running the “discovery carts”.   There’s also the Harn Museum of Art right next door looking for volunteers although I don’t know what kinds they want.

""They fell for us, and for them should fall the tears of a nation's grief.""   The monument itself says they were defending ""right."" It doesn't say that they thought they were doing right--it claims, objectively, that they WERE right. It suggests they were fighting for a holy cause by calling them ""martyrs.""  Consider the other side: ""they fell for us."" Who was that ""us""? Did it include everyone? Were Confederate soldiers fighting for the welfare of the people who lived in a situation of total violence, as other people's property?  None of this is unintentional. The statue was put up by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, who wholeheartedly endorsed the Ku Klux Klan in 1913, nine years AFTER the statue was put up. It is an explicit monument to white supremacy.  The most likely outcome, if it is removed, would be its being relocated to a museum nearby, most likely the Matheson museum five blocks away. That's where this statue should go--not remain on public land, continuing to proclaim 111 years later that the Confederacy was right, and that its cause was holy."

This is the South. People from here fought for the Confederacy, a symbol of slavery and oppression. This is history and even if it is ugly, it was real, and it should be remembered. You seem to be on the same page with this, since you're proposing to move the statue to a museum, rather than bulldoze it.  What you seem to disagree with is the plaque commending the Confederate soldiers (whose motivations were not limited to slavery, but nobody can pretend that wasn't included). Leaving this commendation in the public space implies that Gainesville endorses that message, rather than remembering the history behind it. Bringing the statue to a museum would be expensive and reduce its exposure. Why not, instead, petition to mark the monument as a historical landmark, complete with a sign explaining what the statue represents, what actually happened in the Civil war and what role Gainesville played in the Confederacy, and who donated the statue? It would explain that Confederate pride was still a prevalent idea in 1904 Gainesville. This would, in my opinion, be an even stronger statement (""here lies the symbol of an old, dead idea"") that would actively discredit the message on the plaque, while still preserving its history. And it would be much easier, and cheaper, than pushing it under the rug."
GNV,3c0u0z,chandlercollins8,0,Sat Jul 4 04:00:34 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I really appreciate your levelheaded suggestion. We would definitely prefer the statue moved off of public land--because a statue honoring a horrible thing is still a statue honoring a horrible thing, even if you put some signage around that says, ""In 1904 some people who liked the Klan put up this statue that honors a horrible thing."" I also don't trust the county (the entity with the power to make these changes) to do a proper job of contextualization. For instance, I've confronted now dozens and dozens of people who seem completely convinced that the Confederate cause WAS right. The reason it's still standing is because the idea is alive and well. It seems like the county would seize the opportunity to let the contemporary United States off the hook, when, in truth, the very reason so many symbols of the Confederacy have survived to this day is because white supremacy and racist violence are, tragically, full of life in this country.  I would prefer your suggestion to nothing at all happening, of course."
GNV,3c0u0z,Across_The_River,9,Sat Jul 4 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"If I ran this city, I would look at this data before making a decision:  - Those who commented on the statue from past - 2014  - Those who commented on the statue from 2014 - 2015  - Those who commented on the statue from 2015 - 2016 If the data supports its removal in 2016, it would be relocated to a museum. If my city is supporting some knee-jerk reaction influenced by the media, it would stay.    At any rate it wouldn't get removed that day, which it sounds like that's what you're expecting. As someone mentioned before me, this takes funds and resource efforts. You have to ask yourself if Gainesville public resources are best spent relocating a statue or on something else?    If you have the support in 2016, then you +1 me but I don't see this as a real thing. Sorry buddy.    Edit: Formatting bc I'm a grumpy old man that doesn't understand the internetz"

So, if you take the cats to Animal Services, they may eventually end up in one of the local rescue groups.   Before taking them to Animal Services, I would just make sure you ask if they're full. They are pretty good with getting their cats rescued or adopted (a lot of other nearby county shelters have euth rates of 60% for cats), but it's a pretty busy season right now for both cat and dog intakes and a lot of shelters and rescue groups are full. Holding off for another few weeks might be ideal.   Also, just sharing an extremely cute picture of the cats on facebook and asking your friends to share might help find them new owners too."

GNV,3b4v6b,pretzacoatl,16,Fri Jun 26 00:18:24 2015 UTC,"Checkpoints border on the line of constitutionality. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of them (6-3) due to their effectiveness and intent at catching drunk drivers, with the main dissent being that surprise is crucial to this method.  As a result, the National Highway Safety Transportation Board issued guidelines for police when administering sobriety checkpoints including that police must publicize the checkpoints ahead of time pushing them into a more favorable constitutional position in the public's eye.   They are still quite effective at catching drunk drivers. The average bargoer doesn't check duiblock.com before going out."
GNV,3b4v6b,Fallout2x,6,Fri Jun 26 03:54:25 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I guess I didn't think it through. I automatically want to agree with DUI checkpoints because I feel so strongly about drunk driving, but I didn't consider that. Now I know"

You aren't imparied enough at .08 to justify the massive lifefucking that happens. It's like 7th on the list of risky behaviors that cause accidents. .08 is below ""eating a cheeseburger"".

MADD lobbied nationwide to lower from .10. .10 is still very effective in most states, and the average BAC of arrested drivers remains .17 nationwide.

GNV,3b4t7z,NeuroPsychRai,10,Thu Jun 25 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"My recommendation is to start from the bottom and apply UP. So start with places that are 90% likely to give you an interview: Moe's, Panera, McDonald's, McAllister's, Wendy's, etc.  Then go to the local places that are likely to at least look over your resume: gyms, sports grills and restaurants, movie theaters, etc.  Also remember that there's lots of corporate options: Home Depot, Kmart, Target, Old Navy, etc. The Oak's Mall is where a lot of my friends ended up getting jobs while they were in school, and you can more than likely apply online.  Afterwards, definitely check out one of the temp agencies in town, or try express. At the very least, you'll be able to go in and talk with someone about maybe why your resume isn't working.  And now that you've laid a base, go with the job boards: CareerSource (which is local), Indeed, craigslist, Monster.   And don't forget, you can go to some mom and pop shops with your resume in hand and simply ask if they're hiring. If they say no, thank them for their time, leave your resume for later, and move on. This is how I got hired at a kayak place in high school and it was one of the most fun jobs I've ever had.  Good luck!"

Although one can get a job without them,, they increase your chances by going and speaking to a manager sometime after you apply. Essentially introduce yourself and have them take your name down. When I was applying for Publix for instance, one of the managers told me that because they receive hundred of applications, the people that get noticed are the ones that take the extra step above just filling the application. Again, not necessary however me and 2 friends of mine have acquired a total of 5 jobs this summer already (still working all of them)."

There's a trade off between money and when you work. Want to get the most money? Work weekends 10pm-2am. Surge pricing really boosts your fare. I actually had one kind rider refuse because she realized her friend was about to throw up, so I was lucky. You'll get the occasional guys/girls talking loud, asking silly questions, but you roll with it.   I'm not a morning person, but someone who used Uber very often says early morning rides are good money (think work commutes for people). But even better, he said, was learning the schedule of arrivals in the airport. Since GNV is so small, it has set arrival times for airlines that don't really deviate much day to day. Drive around there to get guaranteed pings in those hours.   I had a small cooler with 4-5 water bottles, offered to put their favorite music genre (pandora/spotify/songza), and had an iPhone or mini-USB charger.

GNV,3aiyl0,Natalyc,10,Sat Jun 20 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, some of the people in this thread suck. Sorry OP.  I'd try some places on 20th Ave., but not the chapter 8 housing. Stay away from places like Ventura and the other complexes across the street from it.  Honestly, just have your parents pull their own credit and pull yours. See who has the best credit score. Then, see if you can get a letter of recommendation from your current landlord, stating you've had a good payment history for 3 years without any issues.  Take this info to a leasing office, or call them, and be upfront. Tell them your situation and ask if they think you'll be approved. Sometimes, they might ask for an additional deposit, or flat out say sorry, not gonna work out. Don't be embarrassed or worried, if you're sincere and upfront, the worst than can happen is they'll politely tell you it might not work out. However, I suspect most places will be willing to work with you.  Keep in mind that Gainesville places aren't super expensive. Plenty of 2br/2ba for < $900/mo. Some places worth looking at are Mill Run, Pinetree Gardens, Courtney Greens, and Pinnacle Point.  Other than that, just look at a map and check out 20th Ave between 34th st and 62nd Blvd. and 62nd Blvd. between 20th ave and the mall. All those places are decently priced, student-friendly, and the offices will likely be willing to work with you.  Really, having shitty credit isn't the end all be all of getting a place in Gainesville. Plenty of competition for housing and plenty of places that will be willing to work with you."

I am not particularly familiar with The Gardens, but just looking at the location, it's in an area that generally has plenty of criminality. It might not be terrible, but it won't be great, either. If possible, I'd stay away from the following area:  South of Newberry Rd, but North of 24th Ave  West of 62nd Blvd, but East of Tower Rd.  Here's a quick map. Red means I recommend not considering places in this area. It's a pretty high criminality/low income parts of Gainesville. While it's not like Compton or Detroit, you might find yourself being a bit uncomfortable with your surroundings.  http://i.imgur.com/f64f3Z5.png  Green are the areas I think you should look into that are near the mall and probably affordably priced. I cut off the map around 34th and didn't highlight anything north of Newberry, but those areas are fine.

GNV,3aiyl0,AxeEffect3890,2,Sat Jun 20 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"You could try Santa Fe Oaks, it's directly across from SFC - however, they do only have 3 bedroom apartments. It's an income-limited community, so you'd have to make within a certain income range to live there (don't know what it is for a 2-person household, sorry). I'm mentioning it because my husband and I got accepted there, and our credit isn't the best right now. I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for since it's a 3-bedroom place, but I wanted to mention it since you haven't gotten a lot of responses.  You might also want to look on Craigslist - a LOT of private landlords list their places on there. In fact, I found my current apartment through CL and have been here for 2 years. (We're only moving because I'm pregnant and we need a bigger place, not because of a bad experience or anything.) I don't think a private landlord would check your credit score - probably just check your references and want to make sure you can pay the rent."

Littering can actually have an impact on our environment in terms of negatively affecting it. The aesthetic part of that is not nearly as important as the environmental impact (""Ew, that patch of sidewalk is ugly because someone threw down that used condom"" vs. ""Someone just caught a disease from picking up that used condom"").  Non-offensive graffiti, on the other hand, does not usually have a serious environmental impact. Each case would be different, obviously. If it were a memorial or tombstone, I'd be on your side in chastising the artist... but this is a trash can."

Recently I was walking by the old AGH area (now innovation square) and admiring the landscaping and infrastructure that was put in there. Well a couple weeks later I noticed someone spraypainted a bunch of nonsense words in red paint all over one of the walls there. It totally ruined the look. It was a couple more weeks until city staff got around to removing it, and now there is a big ugly splotch on the wall where it was. I'm just not really sympathetic to these ""artists"" that randomly deface public property."

Renting a similar sized apartment cost me about $200 in electric/water on my WORST month. My BEST month with GRU has been $210, and I’m at about $350 now, even with keeping my apartment 3-5 degrees warmer than I did in jax.   I feel your pain, and the automatic payment is set to come out one day before my first full paycheck.   If you don’t get what you need here, be sure to check out r/borrow and r/assistance.

GNV,39zqyl,livisocial,4,Tue Jun 16 02:39:23 2015 UTC,I fostered through alachua county humane society the last couple years. They are pretty great. Just tell them what you are interested in and what you can handle. It is definitely a lot of work but is one of the most rewarding things I have ever done. The transformation you will see in previously abandoned and neglected animals is amazing. 2 of the pups I fostered went from completely bald from mange to some of the most adorable dogs.
GNV,39zqyl,mutters,3,Tue Jun 16 03:47:32 2015 UTC,"I foster with Gainesville Pet Rescue. It is easily one of the best decisions of my life. They provide everything for you- food, bowls, toys, medicine, vet visits. You can pick what animal you want (kitten vs dog vs cat for example) and how many. I personally like litters of kittens so they can socialize themselves.  If you have to go out of town or you don't mesh with the animals personality, you can return them.  You typically have the same animal until they're adopted if you choose. The animals are up for adoption THURSDAY-Saturday. for cats, you just dropped them off Thursday morning and picked them up Saturday afternoon. Dogs have to be picked up every day. They're very flexible with these times though- some people just drop the dog off 1 day of the 3.   Let me know if you have any questions!"

I haven't fostered through GPR, but I've fostered for Second Chance, and I've worked really close with Plenty of Pit Bulls - both are great groups. I've worked with so many great pups, and built so many great memories. I even have one foster fail that I can't imagine not having in my life. We ALWAYS need more fosters available, so please seriously consider it."
GNV,39zqyl,pj2d2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"Hey random question but, a friend of a friend says they think someone in their neighborhood is mistreating several pit bulls that they own. She was considering contacting animal services, but is afraid that if she does they will just put them to sleep since pit bulls have such a reputation for violence- do you think plenty of pit bulls might be able to help? Not very familiar with that organization."
GNV,39zqyl,LadyBosie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:00:17 2015 UTC,"I really don't know if they could help - I do know they're inundated with a lot of requests like this, and they're really short staffed unfortunately. You could try, but the best bet is to probably contact animal services. I don't know the exact process, but I think they'll at least come out and make sure they're getting the bare necessities like shelter, food, and water. Maybe a trip and a warning from animal services well help. Probably not the answer you're looking for, but we just have too many animals out there due to too many irresponsible people."
GNV,39zqyl,pj2d2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:10:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate the response. Yeah, that doesn't really surprise me. I volunteer at Operation Catnip and the other day someone called who had offered to fix their neighbors outdoor/indoor cats for them and they threatened them with a gun. I don't know what's wrong with some people!  I'll pass on the info to my friend."
GNV,39zqyl,LadyBosie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"do you think plenty of pit bulls might be able to help?    No.  From Plenty of Pit's website ""Private rescuers like Plenty of Pit Bulls cannot do anything in these cases. ""    (Most) All the local rescues pull directly from ACAS. ACAS doesn't (ever?) put dog directly down (rabies excluded), even dog's they ""want"" to put down are offered to local rescues. And Alachua county has a really low kill rate and is very close to becoming a ""no kill"" county (<10% euthanasia rate.) It will be a little harder this year since Maddie's pulled out, but we can still get there.   All the local rescues will tell you the same thing when you ask them what to do, call ACAS for cases of neglect and the Sheriff's office for cases of ""fighting."" Then, once the officials have handled the situation, rescues like plenty of pit's will come in and help with the aftermath (rescuing the dogs, rehabbing them and finding them new homes.)"
GNV,39zqyl,Ohhhhhk,2,Tue Jun 16 15:20:18 2015 UTC,"My family has fostered over 100 dogs with GPR, and it's awesome.  Takes some work, and you have to be serious about it or you'll just adopt the first dog you get.    They provide everything you'll need, and you just house and care for the animal, and take them to the adoption events."
GNV,39zqyl,Not-in-jail,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"So I have fostered hundreds of animals and fostered for a few different rescues in Gainesville and around the state.  Gainesville is a fantastic town to foster in. There are a bunch of rescues in town. Most of them are worth fostering for. The rescue community is pretty close nit. There isn't a lot of gossip/bickering/politics.    Fostering is a great way to fill your heart. You will get love from animals who have never been loved before. And you will help find them homes that treat them like they deserve to be treated. However, if you foster long enough, your heart will get broken. I still cry over some of my fosters both happy tears and sad.    First thing: make sure you find out what the rescue covers and what is expected of you before you agree to foster for any rescue.   Do you need to provide your own crate? Food? Who pays for vet care? How? What do you do in the case of an emergency?   Also, figure out what you are comfortable with. Set your boundaries and don't break them.    Rescues are great, but they always need more (help) from you and tend to forget that you have needs too. There is always some special case that needs addressing.    Do you only do small dogs? Only males? No bullys? No ""special needs cases?"" Cool. Just remember once you break that rule, the rescue will forget you have that rule and will ask you to continue to break it.   Another rule: Do not foster-fail (adopt) your first foster. Fostering is an emotional activity. It is very easy to fall ""in love"" with your fosters, and very easy to let those emotions guide your decision to adopt one of your fosters. Even if they don't work in your family. This phenomena fades over time. I have seen a lot of people foster fail their first animal only to realize later that they shouldn't have."
GNV,39zqyl,Ohhhhhk,-1,Tue Jun 16 15:06:42 2015 UTC,"I got my pup at the Alachua humane society. Please whatever you do ask them so many questions before you chose an animal. After I signed my papers for my dog they told me he had a heartworm. The treated it but he had to suffer for 4 months because they told me they were unable to get the medication for it. He also had like 4 different parasites and almost died. This was about 2 weeks after I got him he was having all these problems. I know he didn't get the worms when I got him because when he purged them out(all over my bed, btw) they were about 8 inches long. I called the humane society and they told me that a dog there did have worms and they had dewormed all the animals the day I got my pup. Although I got him before they dewormed them. I wasn't very impressed with this place at all. They told me that they wouldn't pay for his treatment so I had to shell out $300 for tests and medications. We got out other dog at the pound and they were much more professional. I hate to bag on places like this, but they really dropped the ball when it came to my animal. I'm so glad I got him out of that place though. He's very grateful and healthy 2 years later."

I'm so tired of seeing over-emotional, un-researched tirades of this sort on Facebook, and now you're plastering them on r/GNV? And you couldn't even link me to the actual post so that I could read it. You just took a screenshot that gives me zero information. Luckily, unlike you, I'm not lazy, and I found it myself.  As someone else pointed out in the comments of the original post, which I'm guessing you were also too lazy to read, this title is incredibly misleading, as many or most state employees also get healthcare for that price, not just Rick Scott.   Your post is pointless. All you did was post a link to a screenshot of a title. It sheds no light on what the bills that were or were not passed actually state or support. I can't even decide if I'm with you or against you because there is no data, just a few out-of-context sentences that don't mean anything without supporting evidence/discussion. It would have been more helpful to link an article or some facts.   If you're that mad about it, channel that frustration into something that proves to me that I should care about your opinion.

You'll need to analyze your own behavior and self control to determine if it's right for you, but MM (moderation management) emphasizes control of alcohol consumption and regulation of how much you drink through your own self-discipline. Compared to AA, which focuses on giving yourself to, and having faith in, some higher power, MM is about you yourself controlling the addiction, which is a lot better if you're not the kind of person who feels very influenced by any higher powers. However, if you feel you're the kind of person who needs to go cold turkey, rather than moderation, it may not be for you.   I'd definitely recommend a one-on-one counselor, but if you feel like a group session would be helpful, MM may be a better option for you than AA."

I believe you can rent canoes there too. $10  Ginnie is pretty nice, but expensive. It can get really crowded (like you mentioned) but what it does have going for it is that if you want to float down the river there are a few launch points and exit points so you can determine how long you want to float down the Santa Fe River. The springs there are also very beautiful.  You can also rent floats and canoes there. $15 to get in (I think? Not including any tube rental)  Manatee springs is very pretty (out in Chiefland). You can also rent canoes there too. 5$  Hart springs in Trenton is pretty big (2 boils, although I think one is more functional than the other). There's a pretty decent boardwalk you can take out to the Suwannee river and there are volleyball areas and canoe/float rental. Last time I went it was like $4.   If you're looking to canoe I would recommend renting a kayak! They are a lot easier and more stable. Also, if you decide to canoe or kayak and you are not experienced I would suggest the Santa Fe River (or the Itchetucknee) vs the Suwannee. The Suwannee is super swift with strong currents (& it's huge!) there's also lots of boat traffic (Santa Fe gets less of because it's a lot more shallow). Also the Suwanne is  dark, murky, and scary lol. I was just out on the Santa Fe last weekend and you could see clear to the bottom!   Sorry for the novel. Hope this was helpful."

If you feel like drinking then go to Ginnie, you have to pay a lot more but they allow booze on the river. I would compare the two as such.... Ichetucknee:Ginnie::Grand Canyon::Las Vegas.    However, if you want to canoe, that's a whole different story. The Rainbow River and Silver River are all super fun to canoe down and they are springfed the entire way so they are beautiful and clear. The Suwanee river is my personal favorite, its blackwater but has springs and rope swings along it every couple miles so its super fun to paddle.

The whole north side is basically off limits to tubers if you go in the afternoon because they only allow a few hundred a day so usually the cap is reached really early, it's pretty pristine and generally pretty quiet up there so you see all kinds of wildlife. Once you get to the south side you do end up having to dodge a bunch of tubers though which can be annoying."

Nice little swimming spring, not much of float one though. And had a little ""beach"" thing.  Things to bring? One crucial thing for me when floating is twine. You can tie your flip flops and other things to your tube. You don't wanna do the walk back bare foot. I love bringing a mask, snorkel, and fins also. You can check out stuff while floating or top diving around the swimming springs."

GNV,39ej6k,yellotheremapeople,5,Thu Jun 11 05:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I don't know much about Ridgemar Commons. I just wanted to comment that I think $875 is really high for that apartment complex, which used to be a rather crappy complex that has recently been remodeled a bit. I had friends that lived there before it became Ridgemar Commons, and they liked it, though they said they had to stay away from the back of the complex because that's where some not-so-good people hung out (maybe drug dealers, I'm not sure). Maybe it's been cleaned up a bit since then, but it's a trend in Gainesville for management companies to come in and put a new face on an old place and try to rent it out for higher than it's worth.  I suggest checking Craigslist, where you can find apartments/condos from people who actually own them. It's easy to find a 2/2.5 condo for the same price you'd be paying or lower.  For example, I lived in Casablanca for a year and loved it. (Would have stayed, but I bought a house.) The complex is quiet and mostly grad students/working professionals, and it's convenient to UF, bus stops, and shopping.   I also lived in Pickwick Park and loved that place as well. It's a little further south than Ridgemar Commons, but it's one of my favorite places that I lived in Gainesville.  The only apartment complexes I ever lived in were Gainesville Place (definitely do NOT recommend) and Stoneridge. I LOVED Stoneridge, but I looked up the Google reviews while writing this, and something must have changed since I was there, because the management when I lived there was EXCELLENT. They fixed problems promptly, and I thought they were very fair. Also, just after I left, they installed solar power, so I assume the utility bills are reasonable. The apartments are huge and the complex is very conveniently located."
GNV,39ej6k,carlidew,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:43:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed reply!  I did consider renting from craigslist, but my main concern is that since I wouldn't know the owner personally, I might not know if they are regular about providing maintenance, or if they create an issue when returning the security deposit. Some apartment complexes are notorious for finding nefarious means to keep your money, and this is when they get rated on the net and a negative rating can hurt business; a private owner might have even less of an incentive to be honest. Do you feel this is a valid concern?"
GNV,39ej6k,carlidew,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from. I've rented from two complexes and four individual owners. Got virtually no security deposit back from the complexes (where I paid THEM to clean the apartment after I left), and got nearly everything back from the individual owners (with ME cleaning everything myself and only hiring a professional carpet cleaner once I was done to deep-clean the carpets).  As far as maintenance, maybe I am lucky, but my landlords were always quick to respond.  Another option for you would be to rent from a real-estate company that manages properties for individual owners. One of the condos I rented was from Mitchell Realty, and they had a great system where you paid rent/security deposit online and could submit maintenance requests online. They were always prompt and very professional. There are other real-estate companies that do this, but some charge fees to the renters (like Bosshardt) so just watch out for that."
GNV,39ej6k,LPBKMIA,2,Thu Jun 11 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"Grad student beginning in the fall as well. I was in Gainesville two weeks ago with my girlfriend and Ridgemar Commons was one of the places I went to look at. Their online marketing is on point so it was an easy decision to put on my list to check out. Sadly, it left a lot to be desired as I think they may have over promised on their website. The community has a bit of a lackluster feel to it. The staff was very friendly but unfortunately that doesn't make up for the dead roach in the middle of the floor in the apartment they showed us. I know Florida has large bugs but c'mon. They're best units are the ones downstairs with wood/tile floors, although they're pretty cramped in my opinion. This said, it's not an awful choice since some of the other apartment complexes we saw were downright disgusting. On the other hand, have you checked out Legacy at Fort Clark? We were between Legacy and the current place we already signed up with which is a personal owner for a great price close to downtown. I highly suggest you continue your search and upvote /u/carlidew's recommendation to go with a property management company."
GNV,39ej6k,vaginasauras,2,Fri Jun 12 14:09:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your reply. Yeah, I did look at Legacy, but it is in the NW where buses are not as frequent as in the SW, plus it's a little above our price range. Following /u/carlidw's suggestion, I am currently looking at AllisonAbles' properties. They seem to be quite highly rated, and offer much larger townhouses at the same price point.  Thanks a lot again! We were on the brink of leasing from RC."

GNV,39avga,Jesv,2,Wed Jun 10 14:34:06 2015 UTC,"I have no advice other than, go to one of those ""pain clinics"". Do they still exist? It used to be a big mill years ago but not sure if it still is. I know Tampa seemed to have a recently running industry. I have not been to any myself but I think it involves an outpatient visit, bring in an MRI, get mess. Everything is out of pocket--they don't accept insurance.  On a serious(?) note, that's horrible that he has extreme back pain!! I've thrown my back out (temporarily) and the pain is debilitating. Can't sit down, can't stand up, can't lay down, can't get up without incurring extreme amounts of pain. (Of course, my issues were muscular and lasted all of a few days.)  It sucks that people who fake back pain have doctors in a state of non-belief. So many people come into clinics, EDs, urgent care centers with ""back pain"" that when legitimate cases come in; they are treated half-heartedly. A sad situation indeed. With narcotics abuse as rampant as it is and doctors licenses on the line, many are just not willing to prescribe.   Narcotic pain medications should really be a temporary solution. Ibuprofen (along with other NSAIDs), antidepressants (off label), neuropathic pain relievers (think neurontin), can all be used successfully to treat back pain. I hope you can find the root cause of the back pain for your husband. Maybe then he can find true relief.   Sorry I couldn't help you."

Great editing and the host was inquisitive without being annoying. Hopefully these keep going."
GNV,38ucpj,alton_brownies,13,Sat Jun 6 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"You're planning on moving and finding a job in a ridiculously competitive environment when 70% of our total population is planning on returning to school. Because of this you're competing with a massive, cheap labor force in two fields that's college students can do. Additionally, there is degree inflation here. Not knowing your degree situation or skill level I'd have to say you're at a disadvantage.   The only advice I have is the same advice I'd give anyone planning on moving to a new place: don't move until you have a job lined up because there is no guarantee of work where you're going."
GNV,38ucpj,accioqueso,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:28:33 2015 UTC,"Understood, and the reason I asked to get some form of perspective. There isn't anything better than knowledge from someone who's experiencing it first hand. Is this Gainesville specifically? Or all over Florida?   From what I've seen and applied for I can see there's at least a need for my skill sets (IT Help desk 1/2, Systems Admin, Technical Support 1/2). I've got a BS in IT and am currently working on my HDI and A+. Other areas of interest are Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa. I'm well aware of that advice, as it's the only thing I've known and been told be everyone, haha. Thank you!"
GNV,38ucpj,accioqueso,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"Gainesville specifically. I know in Jacksonville the town is trying to expand and become a place for start-ups and new businesses. If you haven't been looking at smaller or rising companies I would recommend it, here in Gainesville as well."
GNV,38ucpj,accioqueso,2,Sun Jun 7 00:19:44 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. See? This is the kind of information that, at least I, have been hard pressed to find. Thank you very much. Do you happen to know of any small and up and coming businesses?"
GNV,38ucpj,Pleaseluggage,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"Not off the top of my head. I know in Gainesville there have been a few successful businesses that have come out of the Innovation Academy, you may want to see who is in there right now (it's like an incubator for new businesses, usually started by UF students). Also in Jax they do a huge event every year called One Spark where people trying to find investors and funding for their ideas and startups pitch ideas, you could look into who was there this past Spring for ideas as well."
GNV,38ucpj,Pleaseluggage,8,Sun Jun 7 00:39:37 2015 UTC,"Gotta be serious here:  why the hell Gainesville?  And yeah, unless you're really much better than anyone else here, don't expect to find a job out of state and be sure to sell yourself HARD when you get here. I don't know how IT does that except to say you need to show some serious numbers in your resume (I reduced network congestion through traffic optimization by 90%) to be competitive.   Think of things college students wouldn't be good at and be that person.   Otherwise, good luck my friend."
GNV,38ucpj,Megalonyx,3,Sun Jun 7 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"That's a good question! Honestly, I'm not 100% on Gainesville. North Central Florida, however, is a big preference as it would keep things well rounded. I know that Gainesville as a city is overall well rounded in the technical industry, and also is less affected by the tourism of cities like Tallahassee, Pensacola, Orlando, Daytona, etc. Another plus is looking to continue education, and finding the university to have what I'm looking for. That being said, as in my other reply to the other kind redditor, I'm also looking at different areas. I will not be moving if I don't have a job lined up, however, I'm serious about it."
GNV,38ucpj,carlidew,3,Sun Jun 7 00:16:30 2015 UTC,Is tourism bad?  Yes the university here would make a difference and don't forget that Santa Fe is excellent for what it offers. I would put together a package of your services that show how you can help people (have no idea how you do that) and start cold calling (or emailing) companies you want to work for. Also go to jobs.ufl.edu if you don't already. It's hard when you're not here but maybe you could line up a week to be here and line up lunch meetings with people you want to meet.
GNV,38ucpj,Megalonyx,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:28:35 2015 UTC,"Not in the least! I'm all for tourism, yet have seen and heard more of the negative side from both visiting and locals. While it's only other's opinion, I still know that with my skills and experience as it is now, it'll be more difficult to find positions there due to competition, cost of living vs. compensation, and the overall inflated population of those areas. Unless I'm wrong, in which case, I welcome correction.   I did apply at UF, UCF, UNF, and WDC. Santa Fe didn't have any openings last I checked, but that was Thursday so I'll do that now."
GNV,38ucpj,carlidew,3,Sun Jun 7 00:36:57 2015 UTC,"To quote Gainesville's wiki article, ""The city's job market scored only 6 points out of a possible 100 in the Cities Ranked and Rated guide, as the downside to the low cost of living is an extremely weak local job market that is oversupplied with college-educated residents. The median income in Gainesville is slightly below the U.S. average.""  Probably the worst place to come for jobs, but also it's a town relatively in the middle of nowhere, compared to a lot of other cities.  I only say this because that means it's just tedious to drive to other parts of Florida for interesting events or locations."

One guy posted a notice on his door saying if a Census taker came back he was going to shoot them. I had to go back since I was the supervisor.
GNV,38pfbo,calimer,2,Sat Jun 6 14:35:23 2015 UTC,None of this surprises me. The few times people call in and ask us if we deliver there don't even argue when we say no. They know where they live. Not a pleasant place at all.

Tall Paul's is pretty chill with a large tap selection and darts/foosball but live music can get loud. Lillian's is great, so is 2nd street Speakeasy. Great cocktails and service all around.

It's close in on bus lines to campus but also has PLENTY of parking (& no roam towing, so you can have friends with cars come over without worry!), it's close to Butler Plaza (lots of shopping/restaurants/a movie theater) but not so close that you have to wade through the awful traffic at the plaza every time you come home, there's a 24-hour grocery store next door, and the rent really couldn't be beat. It's not close to downtown, though, so as I mentioned, this might not be exactly what you're looking for - I just like to give them a shout-out anytime I can because they were ideal for me."

GNV,38owcm,thatjenn,2,Fri Jun 5 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"I felt safe at this place. It was 6 years ago so who knows if it's changed, but it was mostly grad students and pretty chill. I was a 25-year-old single lady who often got home late at night (by car) alone and I never thought twice about it. I can't swear that's because it really was 100% safe, but it didn't feel sketch to me at all. I'd moved from subletting at one of the College Manor properties just a few blocks off campus and it felt equivalently ""safe"" to me."

GNV,38owcm,lindseychan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"Hey! I live there presently. It's a positively frugal choice. There's an-site laundry facility, a nice pool, ample parking. It's a very quiet place and the office will warn you it isn't ideal for partying but I definitely wouldn't say you have to tiptoe around. I play medium-loud music often in my apartment. Maintenance is very friendly and responsive! One of the staff members even helped me jump-start my car once! It basically has everything you need to live alone on a budget without major complaints. The biggest negative statement I have to say about it is that the traffic immediately surrounding it can be a nightmare  during the typical rush hours. If you want to turn left onto 34th coming out of the complex, it's a real hassle and you have to cross 3 lanes and U-turn. If I'm leaving for work in the 4-5pm area I leave almost 30 minutes beforehand just because it's a nuisance living on such a major road in gnv. However in the mornings it isn't bad at all and I get to work in 6 minutes. But, you learn the area quickly and get used to it. If you have a car, you won't really care that it's a wee drive to the downtown area. I'd say the area is shabby-safe. It isn't a hotspot for undergrads so it isn't impeccably maintained like some luxury apartment areas, but I'm an 18-year-old female and I've comfortably walked alone to CVS, winn dixie, or whatever at night.  Good luck!"

The apartments themselves are a little outdated in terms of appliances, but the maintenance people were always really nice and quick about fixing anything that went wrong because of that.  I mostly liked it because it was easy to go out downtown at night, plus all the later gator buses go by so you never have to worry about designated drivers or anything. And it's an easy bike ride to campus with a bike lane almost the entire way on 2nd Ave so it feels safer than biking in other areas."
GNV,38owcm,mutters,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:35:45 2015 UTC,Will you be a grad or undergrad? What are you into? My personal opinion is to avoid archer road at all costs. If you're an undergrad id recommend trying to live north of university ave. midtown is where most of the college bars are and is on university and 17th st. Living north of there is ideal for undergrads. If you are a grad downtown will likely be more of your scene. Just avoid most of the area SE of main st and university. It's pretty ghetto

GNV,38o56w,Andreww_ok,2,Fri Jun 5 16:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, Craigslist is a great way to find cheap furniture.  Renting stuff is a waste of money, you're better off just buying a 50 dollar sofa and throwing it in the trash when you're done with it."
GNV,38o56w,mtbr311,3,Fri Jun 5 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"I would say if you don't have a lot of money, then buy all your furniture from craigslist or thrift stores. Renting furniture is tough, because a lot of times things like a cheap lamp end up costing you $150 and it's not even your lamp at the end of it.  I bought an entire living room set - loveseat, couch, coffee table, end table, and console table - for $1,100 from (I think) Furniture Country on 13th. Interest free for 1 year. Paid it off in 7 months. Furniture still looks great after 2 years - I would argue I could sell the whole set for $500 or more.  So if you must have furniture, and don't want to go through craigslist, just buy your own and sell it when you leave. But I would avoid renting furniture at all costs."
GNV,38o56w,risto1116,3,Fri Jun 5 15:55:29 2015 UTC,Don't rent furniture. That's a waste of money. Also don't buy used cloth furniture. Sofas and mattress means fleas and bed bugs .

Until the general community is adequately educated on the benefits of spay-neuter and the resources available to pet owners in the community, cats will continue to go unsterilized and irresponsible pet owners will continue to dump cats onto unsuspecting neighborhoods. That also means that the killing of cats would continue indefinitely.  We are trying to not only control the current population, but also educate the community so that we can stop the cycle of reproduction and death.  We hope that one day there will be a home for every cat in the community. Until then... we spay-neuter, vaccinate and educate."

GNV,37wzv1,ichigogo,3,Sun May 31 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"I have been happy with University Family Dentistry.  They are conveniently located and they take Care Credit so you can pay over 12 months at 0% interest.  Also, they use the Vantage Plan which drops the price around 25%.  You have to pay a small fee to join Vantage, but the cost savings are huge.  The dental hygienists  and the dentists all seem professional and are friendly too. http://www.universityfamilydentistry.com/"
GNV,37wzv1,whynotd,5,Sun May 31 03:32:28 2015 UTC,"As someone who takes Care Credit payments daily, BE CAREFUL WITH THEM. They are now owned by the company that does Rooms to Go's credit system (Synchrony Bank). If you are late once (or don't pay the full balance in time) they hit you with back interest at 29% APR or more. At the end of 12 months if you have a single dollar of the bill remaining, you get to pay ALL the interest you missed out on.   I have also been hearing from clients that if you have multiple purchases at an interest free rate (each charge has its own terms and time limit), using the online payment system now only automatically applies a lump sum to the soonest expiring charge. I hear you have to call Care Credit after each payment to make sure it gets split up appropriately amongst the multiple charges.  **This last bit I have not personally experienced, but have heard from three clients so far this year saying it is the case.  At any rate, read their Terms and Conditions carefully (as one should do for any line of credit).  Source: I work at an Animal Hospital, people choose Care Credit last minute typically to save their family pet, and don't care about the terms at such an emotionally charged time. They later find out they have been hit for 29% interest on a $2000 line of credit."

GNV,37n2lm,risto1116,7,Thu May 28 21:17:25 2015 UTC,"Wish this place got the exposure and/or advertised a little.   We're on our fifth year... you've probably not heard of us either. Gainesville's a weird market to advertise.   Our first year we did a good amount of print advertising and wedding expos. We received no customers from the print, a few from the expos, but the expos introduced us to vendors in our industry that we could build relationships with.  Next week we did print, expos, and television. TV is ridiculously expensive. We put about 20k into that and well, the return was incredibly negative. We followed the advice of marketing professionals, literature, etc. and embraced the awareness that would eventually come from repetition.  After year 2, we had exhausted our savings and needed to re-evaluate our spend. We examined the return for our advertising investments and noted that we lost money on the 3 main spends (expos, tv, print); losing the most on TV, then the Expos (very expensive for vendors, marketed towards people trying to save), and ""lost the least"" on print.  We also looked to see if any of the ""exposure"" from our charity events (Taste of Home, Puttin' on the Ritz, Stop Children's Cancer, Hospice, Season Sponsor of Hippodrome, UF Performing Arts Gala, etc.) had resulted in any clients. We received a few long term, but nothing of significance.  For year 3, we focused hard on networking with other businesses, talking with clients about where they saw ads, and in the meantime pulled all advertising and stopped the charity events (was hard to say no to the charity events, but easier when you realize if you aren't making money you're not in a position to donate).  Interestingly, our main demographic didn't read any of the print, see any of the TV we had done. Even more interesting, they wouldn't be geared towards any of the real local advertising that one can find in Gainesville.  We asked what radio they listened to in the morning... most common answer was they couldn't stand any of the morning shows so either chose NPR, a CD, Satellite, or Pandora.  What TV stations/shows did they watch the most? Most shows they wanted to see they either watched on Netflix, Hulu, or DVRd it.  What did they read? Nothing local... most of the time, they wouldn't even read in the Dr's office; opting for their phones instead.  Advertising in Gainesville is an art... one that we're still trying to nail down. We've just passed our 5th year, and still haven't planned to start back in print, tv, radio... we've found a couple of events that work really well for our demographic and consider them marketing more than charity.  I guess the question is... what / where could Brasington's have advertised to grab your attention?"
GNV,37n2lm,bearkery,5,Thu May 28 21:42:25 2015 UTC,"All very good points. I know advertising in Gainesville truly is difficult. I work at a design ad agency and very little of my clients are Gainesville businesses- mostly because A) I know creating an effective advertising campaign is hard for local businesses and sometimes lengthy, and B) Gainesville is a very young-person town with no patience for advertising.  I'd say social media is a decent start. I follow lots of hikers in Florida on twitter and instagram so I can find new trails and campsites. Partnering with one or two big social media accounts can certainly help spread awareness of their store. Plus you can monitor click rates via Google Analytic, which is always good.  Plus if you run a good social media account, with lots of good posts, images, and videos, you'll gain followers and loyal customers. Not necessarily true for everyone, but it works for lots of my clients.  I'd also suggest events. Any of the craft beer festivals that come around had me and my friends in attendance- most of which are also hikers. Plus events give you a chance to give away free stuff and everyone likes free stuff.   Advertising around campus is usually a decent bet. One of my clients is a cell phone repair store. They had stickers printed out with their name, website, and phone numbers. They handed them out along with bottles of water and free tee shirts around campus during freshman orientation time. Lots of students were putting the stickers on bus stops, lamp posts, etc. It was an accidental way of advertising a second time.  Print advertising is dying hard. There's lots of free magazines handed out that are being read by no one. And these magazines want upwards of $5,000 to advertise in them, with NO analytics to verify success rate. Very rarely do I recommend a client to advertise in print. It's totally dependent on their demographic and even THEN I don't pull the trigger unless I can negotiate a really good deal.  Television in Gainesville is terrible for advertisers. Mostly because GTN and TV20 fudge their numbers hardcore. I've negotiated $12,000 tv ad campaigns down to < $3,000 just by asking them to prove the value of their audience and prove their numbers are real. GTN was the biggest liar, for anyone interested. Told me they have 20,000+ viewers, but their salesperson slipped up on the phone and admitted that the real number was around 3,000. Plus, I typically only use local TV for sporting events (college/pro football, March Madness, etc).  Anyway, I'm not trying to make excuses. I know exactly how hard it is here. We're a small town with big town prices for advertising. Plus, with the ever-increasing popularity in online shopping, it's hard to get customers to spend money on you when there's a cheaper price available without leaving the house."

GNV,37n2lm,rabidgoldfish,1 point,Fri May 29 04:22:30 2015 UTC,"After 43 years, Brasington’s Outfitters closing on Saturday     By Anthony Clark  Business editor  Published: Thursday, May 28, 2015 at 1:57 p.m.  Last Modified: Thursday, May 28, 2015 at 1:57 p.m.     Brasington’s Adventure Outfitters is closing Saturday after 43 years in business, with owner Bob Ackerman citing declining business as a result of competition from online shopping and big-box stores — and fewer people going outdoors.     The store at 2331 NW 13th St. offers gear and clothes for hiking, camping, backpacking and kayaking.     Ackerman said Wednesday that there’s not much left from a going-out-of-business sale. The store first announced its plan to close May 13 on Facebook.     “People are starting to pick through the fixtures and banners and whatever’s left,” he said.     The store will open June 3 for one last event that was previously scheduled for Backpacker Magazine, with products and presentations.     Ackerman, who bought the business in 1997, said Brasington’s had its best year in 2008 and business has declined every year since for several reasons. The recession hurt discretionary spending and several big stores in the area closed.     “When Wal-Mart left, it’s not a business we thought of as sharing many customers, but that big hole in the area where we’re located just caused a kind of a domino effect. … It was just very desolate here,” he said. “Now it’s all coming back again, but it’s been too much. We can’t continue.”     Big-box sporting goods stores started offering kayaks at lower prices and Brasington’s sales went from 400 kayaks a year to less than 40 each of the last two years. The unpredictability of snow out West hurt sales of winter gear.     Ackerman said he sees a generational change away from small-scale retail to online shopping.     He said he also sees a major decline in participation in outdoor activities.     “That’s an issue I think long term I’m very disturbed about, not just because of my business but for what it does for our constituency in terms of preserving wild places,” he said.     He said the store’s 10 employees all seem to have new jobs lined up, “everybody but me.”     Ackerman has served on the City Plan Board for eight years.     The late J.J. Brasington opened Brasington’s Trail Shop in 1972 at what is now Lloyd Clarke Sports at Northwest 13th Street and 16th Avenue. Brasington’s moved four years later to its current location.     J.J.’s brother, longtime Cadillac and Oldsmobile dealer Johnnie Brasington, died Saturday at 104.     Ackerman, a practicing trial attorney, had been a customer of the store and bought the business from J.J. Brasington’s family in 1997.     “Honestly, I didn’t think it through very well, but it has been one of the best experiences I’ve ever had,” Ackerman said.     “I’ve gotten to know almost everybody in Gainesville. It’s been nice. It’s made me feel very positive towards Gainesville and we’re getting lots of people in with reminiscences. I’m not happy that the business is going away but it has overall been an extremely positive experience.”"

Roberts then sent a total of 240 texts, which included photos and videos of him having sex with another woman, the report states.      The woman later learned Roberts used her phone number to create a Craigslist advertisement of a woman looking for sex after she received several phone calls and texts from random men who were looking for companionship. A subpoena executed by GPD turned up information that the ad was tied to the email address of ibuildgrowrooms@gmail.com, and messages were sent from an Internet service account at 3816 SW Fourth Place. This was the address where Roberts lived during the time period the ad was created, the report states.      Another subpoena executed by GPD revealed Roberts’ phone also was tied to the email address used in the Craigslist ad. Also, there were of texts consulting people on how to build marijuana grow rooms, the report states.      The woman who met Roberts on Tinder identified him through his personal website that advertises his services as a model under his real name, the report states.      Roberts was subsequently charged with battery, stalking and fraud.      He already was in the Alachua County jail on a charge of sexual assault after he was accused of raping a UF foreign exchange student on April 4 after she refused to have sex with him. In that incident, Roberts allegedly was forcing the student into various sex acts when a GPD drove by and saw the battery in process. Roberts saw the GPD officer and ran but he was caught and arrested.      As of Thursday afternoon, Roberts remained in custody on a combined $795,000 bond."

GNV,37jvjw,whynotd,3,Thu May 28 05:50:31 2015 UTC,"I just moved to Gville back in Jan for a job from VA Beach, I used the PadMapper app to sift through Craigslist listings via a map and was able to find a pretty nice spot called Treehouse village just about a mile South of downtown for $700/month. I went with it because it's 2 bedroom with good Sq footage and a washer/dryer in the unit, it's also surrounded by trees and right next to the Sweetwater Preserve so I'm only a few minutes away from some awesome nature paths. Down here you're away from the college scene and it's nice and quiet and peaceful, but you can get just about anywhere within 15 minutes.  There is downtown life which consists of about 3 blocks or so of bars and restaurants and the hippodrome theatre, the busyness really varies from day to day but typically Wed-Sun it gets pretty lively down there with Mon-Tues being pretty dead. If you take a left on University Ave while in downtown in about a mile you hit what they call Midtown across from the UF campus.  There are more bars and restaurants there with a definite more college vibe. There are some parts of town that are pretty run down and you'll see a lot of buildings that use to be something and now just sit there.  Personally for me I'm over the going out and drinking phase which seems like the thing to do around here. There is still a lot to do, but you'll need to seek it out a bit more. Definitely check out La Chua trail and watch the gators and wildlife just feet from you, and there are tons of great nature spots around to soak in. There is also a pretty cool music scene down here and I regularly attend the open mics on Sundays at Coffee Culture and there are music and comedy shows going on each week around the venues too.  As someone that moved from a much more heavily populated area of VA Beach life down here seems pretty slow paced and relaxing, there are nice boughts of action, but overall don't expect big city living or you'll be severely disappointed and antsy for more action. That brings me to the jobs down here, there aren't that many and basic jobs are typically gobbled up by college kids. I moved for a tech job downtown and within 3 months realized they misinterpreted the job description to get me down here and that it wasn't gonna work out long term so we split ways. I've spent the last 2 months looking for great jobs and I'm coming up blank, so I'm actually moving out to San Antonio to work for RackSpace.  My lease runs till the end of July and if you're coming down mid July I might be down to sublet at a low cost for a couple weeks if you just wanted a place to crash and get your bearings to figure out which area of down you wanted to end up at. Shouldn't take to long to figure out because you can explore the entire area in a full day or two with no problem."

GNV,375k2r,jameson_water,2,Mon May 25 19:10:34 2015 UTC,most music venues do.  High Dive sells them as well.  Just ask the bartender.
GNV,375k2r,thesakeofglory,1 point,Mon May 25 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"This absolutely kills me. As someone who has played in metal bands, almost everyone we played with seemed to think louder is better, and then wonder why people go outside 10 min into their set. It's not cuz they don't get you're music, it's cuz they want to be able to hear the next day."

GNV,370auy,fl3xtra,1 point,Sun May 24 12:20:16 2015 UTC,You'd definitely have a chance at quarterback!  Of course if you kept on having trouble someone else would want to take over.  We play hard but it is also a nice atmosphere vs people being jerks to each other.  If someone makes a good catch even if they are on the other team we congratulate them.

GNV,36xho1,Across_The_River,13,Fri May 22 22:50:37 2015 UTC,Update:  My son and a couple friends of mine drove out to the address in Hawthorne and knocked on his door. He answered and was really psyched to have his wallet back. It was nice for my son to see an example of doing the right thing actually working out.
GNV,36xho1,optionalmorality,3,Sat May 23 04:36:49 2015 UTC,Props for showing your kid how to do things the right way and setting a great example.
GNV,36xho1,cripplingSeann,2,Sat May 23 04:47:42 2015 UTC,"Good deal, friend. Glad to know there are still honest people about."
GNV,36xho1,atinasutherland,2,Sat May 23 06:54:00 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! I have lost my wallet enough times that I actually have a backup wallet at home, complete with a  debit and ID card. I've kept a note, a $20 and a full book of stamps behind my license in the one I carry asking whomever finds it, to keep whatever cash I have but use the stamps to at least mail my cards back to me. Haven't got a single return in the last 15 years. Thanks for being a good person."
GNV,36xho1,MattyXarope,3,Sat May 23 07:11:08 2015 UTC,I will take it to him tomorrow I guess. I just wanted to see if someone might know him. Didn't want him to be without his wallet for Friday night.
GNV,36xho1,carraway,2,Sat May 23 00:51:04 2015 UTC,"I found this wallet at around 630 pm on 05/22 at the SW 34th Street Post Office. I don't want to drive all the way out to Hawthorne to return it, so I thought I'd try here first. Anyone know Richard Alan Hill? He looks to be 25."
GNV,36xho1,MattyXarope,2,Fri May 22 22:52:23 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it says somewhere on the license that if you put it in the mailbox they will return it.
GNV,36xho1,MVAgrippa,2,Fri May 22 23:37:15 2015 UTC,"And what about the rest of the wallet? Does their policy only apply to the license, or would the entire wallet be included?   If it's just the license, and OP is going through the effort to return the whole thing, might as well keep it all together."
GNV,36xho1,jlkass,2,Sat May 23 01:52:14 2015 UTC,I think it's something from the DMV so just the license.  Link: [http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1f0els/lpt_if_you_find_a_lost_drivers_license_you_can/()
GNV,36wwye,handlethatscandal,1 point,Fri May 22 20:08:27 2015 UTC,I thought the only bus line that existed was greyhound. That's the only one I've ever seen coming into and out of town.
GNV,36wwye,ryancunderwood,1 point,Fri May 22 23:07:37 2015 UTC,"A while back I saw Megabus going from GNV to Savannah, but not anymore it seems. Maybe Greyhound is the only option nowadays."
GNV,36wwye,atinasutherland,1 point,Sat May 23 00:06:53 2015 UTC,"I used to ride the Greyhound several times a year to go back home to Wilmington, NC. Savannah was a stop along the way. It's interesting to say the least. You leave Gainesville around 4:30pm, stop in Lake City, then arrive in Jacksonville around 11pm and hit Savannah around 2am. It's more waiting than actual travel time. After you cross the bridge in Savannah, you end up in a shady part of town, late at night. I've lived in New Jersey so I don't personally think it's that bad. It is Greyhound so I've never seen a station where being mugged wasn't a possibility, so there's that. Also, to get back is a motherfucker. I recommend having a friend pick you up in Jacksonville around midnight, otherwise you have to go to Tallahassee and won't get back to Gainesville until around 6am."

GNV,36nwax,carlidew,10,Wed May 20 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"We could do a potluck lunch/hangout at Poe Springs. It's free, it's not nearly ever as crowded as Ginnie Springs, and there are little pavilions where we could set up food and hang out when not in the springs.   Poe also connects to the Santa Fe River (like Ginnie), so you can swim there or in the spring. There is no tubing access like Ginnie has, but if you're really into that, you can still bring a floaty and float around the spring."
GNV,36nwax,FelicisAstrum,2,Thu May 21 12:42:21 2015 UTC,I like the idea of a springs trip!

GNV,36nwax,cripplingSeann,2,Thu May 21 03:29:02 2015 UTC,last year we did a picnic/nature walk at Millhopper meetup.  Something like that might be fun.    Another option could be one of the breweries or other beer/coffee shop (like Curia.)
GNV,36nwax,engineeringChaos,4,Wed May 20 19:45:11 2015 UTC,"Another option could be one of the breweries   Yeah, like child-friendly First Magnitude!  I'm partly being sarcastic based on the earlier thread but in reality it would probably be fun.  Been meaning to check out Curia."

GNV,36nwax,Lilusa,3,Wed May 20 20:04:43 2015 UTC,There's the new video arcade bar...barcade(?) downtown. It does get kind of crowded sometimes though and it's 21 and up...Maybe a good idea for a side quest.
GNV,36p2l9,Jacob3d,5,Thu May 21 00:21:23 2015 UTC,"Springs will absolutely be packed although you might have some luck at Ichetucknee if you go early as they limit the number of people to 750.  Still a good amount of folks, though.  You could check out the Hawthorne Trail, Paynes Prairie, San Felasco, or Devil's Millhopper.  I'm sure those will all have a little spike in attendees because of the holiday but probably nothing like you'd see at the springs.  If you're up for a little drive you can check out the Ocala National Forest or Homosassa Springs Park.  You can make a day trip out of St. Augustine (~1.5hr drive) or check out Savannah (~3hr drive) over a night.  Cumberland Island and Jekyll Island are both between Jax and Savannah, although you'll probably need reservations to camp at either."

The lot also gets full during football games, even though there are tow signs.  It's close to campus which is nice.    Just a generic small 1 bedroom apartment.  Perfect for 1 person.  She also had 2 cats."
GNV,36npos,Lilusa,1 point,Wed May 20 20:08:50 2015 UTC,"Lived in a couple of Gore Rabell places during college... including San Mitchell. I don't regret it, because the prices were insanely cheap, but as others have said, they are slum lords. Document the before and after condition of each apartment with detail, thru photographs. They always tried to charge me for 'cleaning', until I showed them how filthy the places were before we moved in (they always backed off).  I eventually stopped renting from them when they claimed we had to leave an apartment because they were tearing it down, and then they didnt. Perhaps it was a way to raise the rent to a higher rate.  The San Mitchell parking lot gets filled with true assholes during games who will move your trash cans or other parking lot blocking devices and take your parking spots, even though they dont live there. Only lived there for one year, however."
GNV,36npos,kingkong954,2,Thu May 21 02:50:09 2015 UTC,I rented through them years ago and they are slumlords but I'd say better than other slumlords such as Mitchell Realty. If you're young be prepared to be treated like your going to turn the place into a crack house. I don't blame them since I'm sure they have properties that are actual crack houses.

GNV,36k2ux,commiecat,6,Wed May 20 18:15:21 2015 UTC,"Some probably non-helpful observations: The first pic is taken inside a recent model Mustang, that fella is excited at having a car full of hot girls. Good for him. They are on campus. I think on Gale Lemerand Drive, I could be wrong though. Those look like dorms in the background. Maybe put some posters up there. I don't think the driver is in any other pictures, nor the girl in the front seat. The girls in back are too poorly lit to guess.  The party pic is either student ghetto, between the law school road and university, or north of Untiversity in that same area...Possibly west of 34th st. The guy holding the narccistick looks like fellar #2 in the raft picture. The second girl back from Mr.Towel cape is wearing very similar sunglasses to a girl in the back driver's side of the Mustang.  The raft picture looks like the float from Ginnie Springs, near where you get out. The guy in the Ray Ban knockoffs (Wobbley Parker?) is in his underwear and holding his cheer-beer upside down. Once again I think dude#2 is Mr. towel cape from the party pic.   The third pic looks a little like Ichetucknee to me I could be very wrong though. I wouldn't expect school buses at Ginnie, those are legit school buses not re-purposed (too new). The case of wine indicates the group is probably not affiliated with the school buses. I don't see any of them in the other pictures. I'm curious if it's taken after or before the others.  I'm bored. You could make posters and put them up around dorms and on mustangs. Make sure to find a way to verify ownership, I dunno how. Maybe a date with one of the hotties in the pictures..."

I get the feeling next week will be almost as strong a week as the first for it once people are talking about it.  It was everything I miss about fun action movies. The exposition never slowed it down and was actually incorporated smoothly into the story, it was visually stunning, it created a world (albeit horrific) that was just different, and no fabricated sentimentality. I could keep going, but yeah, definitely makes you want to drive your car faster afterwards."

It's a movie I paid no attention to until Wednesday when I realized the insane reviews it had been getting (98% on 150+ reviews).   It was so over the top and wild but so well put together. The visuals were spectacular and the soundtrack even better. I was smiling all throughout.

GNV,36aza2,bootysatva,24,Sun May 17 22:14:44 2015 UTC,I think it's exactly what Gainesville needs. I've lived here my whole life and this town has always lacked places that don't just cater to students. I'm fine with a family-friendly place that serves alcohol but repels 21-year-olds.

GNV,36aza2,risto1116,1 point,Sun May 17 23:47:05 2015 UTC,Went there recently and liked it a lot! Their social media person gave me the impression it was a biker bar- but it's not at all.
GNV,36aza2,pj2d2,3,Sun May 17 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"My impression of it is a country bar. I was really excited about CB since it's walking distance to my house, but I still find myself going other places. I need to get back and check it out again (been a couple months), but last I was there, their beers were expensive, didn't find too many unique beers, and their staff wasn't knowledgeable about the beer they sold. They also seem to have an identity crisis. They pride themselves as a craft beer bar, but then they push bucket of Budweiser specials. Just seems odd to me."
GNV,36aza2,risto1116,2,Mon May 18 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"That's actually a good point. ""Identity crisis"" is a good way to define their problem. Like I said, whoever runs their social media isn't doing a good job."
GNV,36aza2,pj2d2,3,Mon May 18 16:22:48 2015 UTC,And speaking of their social media person... Take today's post for example. You're a restaurant - now why in the hell would you use steal other images to advertise your food?!?!? Notice anything similar?
GNV,36aza2,risto1116,2,Mon May 18 17:21:54 2015 UTC,"The posts read like they're written by someone much older: the amount of exclamation points, the quality of the pictures, use of almost all stolen pictures... I'm sure this person just doesn't ""get it"" and they're okay with current business. They have over 100 reviews and they seem pretty popular. But they could be advertising/marketing SO much better."
GNV,36aza2,exoxe,2,Mon May 18 18:30:58 2015 UTC,Their social media person is a joke.
GNV,36aza2,risto1116,8,Tue May 19 03:12:28 2015 UTC,"You're the second person I've heard say that, and it's pretty much keeping me from going there. It's kinda far from my house and I love most of their beers, but if there's so many kids there that two different people have complained, I think I'll just drink from the comfort of this bar I'm drowning my sorrows in."
GNV,36aza2,sekoku,9,Sun May 17 23:37:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the children aren't the problem. The problem is the parking. There is SUPER limited parking to where you either have to bike or park a mile away. :/"
GNV,36aza2,commiecat,7,Sun May 17 23:54:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't let that be the reason to avoid it.  They've got great beer themselves with several other taps of various craft brews.  A food truck sits in the parking lot (vendors vary daily) and they'll usually bring the food in if you have a table.  I go there as a family and meet friends.  The indoor area has ample seating and usually not as many little kids.  Between the conversations and TVs you probably won't hear any unless they're pitching a fit.  The outside areas are set up for kids and that's where we go.  If a child were to start fussing inside I'd expect most people would take them outside.  I think it's a great spot.
GNV,36aza2,xlino,4,Mon May 18 02:20:38 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, you could just try swamphead. Imo their beers are way better anyways"

GNV,36aza2,carraway,9,Wed May 20 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"Everyone arguing in this thread is all:    There are other, crazier bars. It's not Gator City!  But they close at 9! Other places close at 2! This has an unexplained meaning! It's not like it's a place where people go to get wasted anyway.    Look, that's all fine. One thing though: it's a bar--a place whose primary reason for existing is being somewhere adults of a certain age go to relax, socialize, and lose their inhibitions to varying degrees.   It's perfectly reasonable for an adult to not want to be around kids simply because it's their time to get away, and others' kids can be a annoying hindrance/distraction from that. Nothing to do with ""get wasted"" or ""party all night"".   Can they simply go somewhere else? Sure! But it's also reasonable to make a post saying they'd like a place even more if they didn't have to."

GNV,36aza2,carraway,2,Mon May 18 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"Have you been there?   Starting with this is like someone telling you they don't like a band's latest album, and your default proposition being ""Have you even heard it?"" Not very respectful. Yes, I have been there (too) many times.   The argument that it's simply ""a bar"" that children shouldn't be at is ridiculous.   That's fine. That's a perfectly reasonable opinion. The only thing I said was:    Can they simply go somewhere else? Sure! But it's also reasonable to make a post saying they'd like a place even more if they didn't have to.   My original point is how ridiculous it is for everyone to jump down OP's throat because she expressed a perfectly reasonable, non-threatening opinion in a laid back way. But that's Reddit I guess."

Not very respectful. Yes, I have been there (too) many times.   Well when most of the people in this thread are commenting about bars being inappropriate for children without having been to the location it's a reasonable question to start with.  No disrespect intended.   My original point is how ridiculous it is for everyone to jump down OP's throat because she expressed a perfectly reasonable, non-threatening opinion in a laid back way. But that's Reddit I guess.   Fair enough.  I made a simple response to OP.  My issue was with the comments about it being a poor place to bring kids.

GNV,36aza2,MissCricket,13,Mon May 18 02:49:43 2015 UTC,"Well it seems most of the ""don't bring kids"" response are from people who have never been there.  It's not a little bar like Nelly's, it's a brewery and beer garden.  There's an outdoor warehouse space with corn hole and tables, an indoor bar with their taps and TVs, and a sizeable outdoor beer garden with ladder toss and Tonka trucks and fire pits.  If you stay in the bar it's probably the same atmosphere as any sports bar but with better beer (imho).  It's not absolutely kid free but most of them will be in the outside areas.  Grab a side table, drink a flight, and catch whatever game is on TV.    We're not taking our kids to a dimly-lit bar to drown our sorrows.  We have a responsible drink or two (depending on who's driving), let our daughter play in the outdoor areas clearly designed with kids in mind, and get our growlers filled."

GNV,36aza2,xlino,9,Mon May 18 19:48:58 2015 UTC,"There's a reason they don't stay open until 2 am, it's not a club, it's a brewery that serves beer, not to mention the food trucks. Do you get upset when people bring their kids to restaurants, too?"
GNV,36aza2,MissCricket,0,Mon May 18 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"Lol as opposed to a brewery that doesnt sell beer? You cant compare a restaurant to a brewery. A restauraunts primary goal is to sell food, alcohol is secondary. Drunk people at a restaurant are not anywhere near as common as drunk people at a brewery where selling alcohol is the whole point of the establishment. Yes people dont go to fm to get shitfaced but to say drunk people there are a rarity is false."
GNV,36aza2,xlino,6,Mon May 18 02:54:12 2015 UTC,"Lol are you drunk right now? What is wrong with drunk people, anyway? Also, FM is probably the best bar to go to if you're not going to drink because the whole atmosphere isn't just catering to drunk people. The noise level is tolerable, the beer is good, and you can bring your own food (because those $6 beers add up fast...). Also, my distinction was that it's a brewery which serves beer, like in a bar, as opposed to just selling it wholesale."
GNV,36aza2,MissCricket,1 point,Mon May 18 03:04:28 2015 UTC,"Lol are you drunk right now?   Not at all   What is wrong with drunk people, anyway?   Nothing, around other adults of a legal age.  I know there's no way I'm going to sway your opinion here. But people drunk in a bar arent exactly going to be acting in a way thats mindful of there kids being around. Nor should they have to."
GNV,36aza2,xlino,4,Mon May 18 03:23:04 2015 UTC,I think it's actually illegal to be so drunk you're a danger to the people around you (children or otherwise).
GNV,36aza2,greenhands,-1,Mon May 18 03:28:03 2015 UTC,You don't have to be a danger to people around you to be drunk enough to not realize there are kids around and not watch your language or talk about things you wouldnt want kids overhearing.

GNV,362yz1,DVSH,2,Fri May 15 18:48:06 2015 UTC,Central Florida is tough for sunsets since it's hard to get places where trees aren't in the way of the horizon. You want to try to get higher (atop of taller buildings or structures—even parking garages) or Paynes Prairie. Even some of the lakes and ponds will help because the taller things that normally interfere aren't as close to you.
GNV,362yz1,foxtalep,1 point,Fri May 15 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"I think the easiest place would probably be looking out over the prairie. Just drive down 13th St/441, there is a little rest area on east side of the road that you can pull off on.  Bolen's bluff is just south of that and it has a trail that leads through the woods but you can eventually come out onto the prairie. Also, the La Chua trail south east of town leads to the prairie as well. The only problem with these two is that I think they close around dusk so it might be cutting it really close.  Those are wide open places that come to mind and might be good."

This is also a good stretch of road for seeing the wildflowers in the spring.  Alternatively (for terrain that has more hills) take Newberry to Jonesville then turn northward on NW 143rd Street and proceed toward Alachua.

GNV,35sivg,commiecat,31,Wed May 13 03:32:14 2015 UTC,"Why do you think we could become like Portland or Austin?  Our culture is probably similar but those are two fairly large cities; Portland being the largest city in the state and Austin being a capital.  Gainesville has a fraction of their respective populations.  I think anybody coming from a city will tell you that Gainesville's overall cost of living is low.  I moved here in '97 from South Florida and it's much cheaper living here.  Sure GRU's rates are some of the highest in the state but property, insurance, food, and other utilities are quite affordable when you compare to ORL, JAX, TAM, etc.  Our size can't accommodate keeping all the graduates and I'd imagine most students want to go to larger cities when they leave.  I came here with no intent of staying but I'm still here and quite like it now with a family.  There aren't as many opportunities here but Gainesville does have industry and good jobs.  Forbes currently ranks Gainesville #83 best place for business and careers overall and at a quick glance we'd be in the top-10 of cities with populations fewer than 300k.  If you like the outdoors this is a great spot: Devil's Millhopper, Paynes Prairie, San Felasco, Hawthorne Trail, botanical gardens, and several springs nearby to name a few.  Gainesville is bike-friendly and lends itself to having one of the highest bike commuter percentages in the nation, equal with Portland.  Traffic isn't bad compared to larger cities and our grid is quite easy to navigate.  The agriculture here is great and we have some awesome local food available to us at restaurants and markets.  We're within a 3 hour drive of metro areas like ORL, JAX and TAM or smaller historical cities like St. Augustine and Savannah.  Go a little further and you can hit Miami or Atlanta.  We're an hour flight from the largest airport in the world.  It really boils down to if you like Gainesville as a smaller city or if you want something more like a metropolis.  If our population doubled we'd presumably get more industry, job opportunities, and ""things to do"" but with that we'd lose a lot of what I happen to like about Gainesville."

If you're talking about entry level positions then yes, and you're going to have that exact same competition in any city of equal or larger size than Gainesville.  The students are competing against other students and people with little to no experience in the position they're looking for.    Why would a company offer an experience-based position to someone without the experience?  Sure, that person might not get paid as much but your staff would also be spending more in training.

First, it's illegal to do that with unpaid internships.  Second, if a paid intern is doing the work of an actual employee then the company needs to compensate accordingly in regards to pay and benefits.    I honestly wonder if some people in this thread have either held an internship or worked at places that hired interns regularly.  It's not like a company with a full-time position available requiring a degree in engineering will say, ""Well we can get an intern to do the work for half the price!""

I fortunately haven't had to look for another job around here <knock on wood>, but from what I hear and see, it looks like we're getting more and more opportunities. One thing I've noticed about this college town though is since it's full of people w/o much experience, the pay is often really low. So they get a little experience and move on.  Regarding GRU, I hear so many stories about them, but I've been here forever and haven't had a problem. 3BR house and I think my bill has been over $200 only once or twice - and that's extremely high for me."
GNV,35sivg,Ntopper,10,Wed May 13 12:22:41 2015 UTC,"My theory is that, since the cost of living is high (take GRU for example), it's cheaper for individuals to move elsewhere after graduating over staying in Gainesville.        But look at the cost of living in all of the places where bright people go. San Francisco, Palo Alto, Seattle, even Portland or Austin aren't cheap places to live. The places that brain-drain Gainesville are actually far more expensive. So that's something to think about.

Or ""There's UF and there's nothing else.""   It's getting there, but it'll still take a little while."
GNV,35sivg,Lilusa,2,Wed May 13 13:08:19 2015 UTC,"Celebration Point will probably be good for the city.   Ehhh  i feel the city already has too much going on in regards to mass housing.  Many apartments sit empty, as well as many store fronts.  Also, does gainesville really need more chain restaurants and big box stores (such as cheesecake factory and a second sam's club)?"

GNV,35sivg,furryoso,4,Wed May 13 09:27:42 2015 UTC,"Gainesville is a true college town. Comparing it to Portland is erroneous— Orlando:Gainesville::Portland:Eugene.   As a college town, I truly believe Gainesville is stepping away from its potential and trying to become something it neither has the infrastructure nor economy to support.   You're seeing local businesses close with chains to replace. Some can be said of a dying industry irrelevant of Gainesville; for example losing Central Florida Office Supply, Harmons, and Licham were sad but reflective of a national shift away from those types of stores.   Eugene, Ann Arbor, Athens are more similar of a comparison. I've spent some time in those three and Gainesville has some qualities the others can learn from — but those towns have  a vibrant local, independent food scene that survives from locals when students leave. You're seeing a shift here towards chains which I think UF shares responsibility for ( putting chain restaurants in Reitz and the old Hub really had an impact and started a chain reaction).   So, there's a reason why Google and Twilio left Ann Arbor. Of course Google opened a huge office there years later.  The best route for this city is to embrace what we are and not pretend to be something different."

GNV,35sivg,whynotd,6,Thu May 14 12:34:28 2015 UTC,Celebrations and the whole Archer Road area is the armpit of Gainesville. What did the developer of Butler North and Celebrations just do? They clear-cut all the large trees while  Gainesville is known for its beautiful tree canopy.  Archer Road has the most car accidents of any road in Gainesville too.  That whole area is a recipe for disaster.  The jobs there are going to be minimum wage jobs. I predict that the Archer Road area is going to be a giant slum with too much traffic and low income housing.

Why is this?   There is a near infinite cheap labor force which businesses leverage to keep costs low.  You can expect to make significantly lower in practically any position here in Gainesville than you would in either Portland or Austin, simply because there are literally tens of thousands of students willing to work for minimum wage just to get something on their resume.   since the cost of living is high    The cost of living here is absurdly low, much lower than the two cities you likened us to."
GNV,35sivg,gatorwithlipstick,2,Wed May 13 17:44:06 2015 UTC,I know I'm late here but just wanted to add my two cents - My decision to not stay has nothing to do with cost of living. I'm an accounting major and there are only a few very small public accounting firms since the economy here doesn't allow for much more. So it could be for students in other fields as well that the jobs/opportunities just aren't here.
GNV,35sivg,thanksdollface,2,Wed May 13 15:06:43 2015 UTC,"While I also agree with you, Gainesville does have the potential, and really was the Portland of Florida a couple of years back, but have taken a wrong turn.  Kids can't stay due to lack of normal paying jobs, or they stay and get a serving job.    I left a few years ago, and moved back to a completely new town.  When I left, there were businesses and young owners popping up everywhere, like boca fiesta, palomino's, the midnight, mars, and there were ALWAYS good national acts coming through whether it were a good band at Common Grounds, or something through UF that was open to the community.  I've been living here again for a little over a year, and have seen it hit rock bottom as far as it being a community I once knew it as, but I see it working toward that again.  People are opening yoga studios, and First Magnitude is offering events that are helping. And the Top has been making an effort with keeping downtown alive by opening up the Wooly, No Name Bar, and now that Bar-cade.   I definitely get what some of ya are sayin, because I'm not even 30 yet, and I have never felt older in my entire life, and feel like I should be retiring soon... lol.   And honestly, Gainesville has the SHITTIEST landlords ever, and no one cares about their property.  It's funny, because I've been debating on moving somewhere else a lot in the last few months, but like someone else said, there is bubble happening right now, and saving money is pretty cool in my book for now.  Gainesville is actually a lot cheaper to live for college grads than most, but most jobs around here suck, and it can be hard to ""break in"" to a lot of areas here.    So I agree, it does have a lot of potential, it seriously was the Portland of Florida, but businesses fail, and new ones come in, and it will hopefully come back.  As far as for those in our mid-20's that stayed, it needs more."

GNV,35sivg,Miz_pizzyizz,6,Wed May 13 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"UF needs to not be the center of the economy.   Very true. At one time Gainesville seemed like it was trying to maximize its' potential but that path seems to have gotten derailed. At one time, Alachua County had the highest real estate tax rate in FL partly because state owned properties (UF/SFC/etc) do not pay taxes to the county which placed a huge burden on homeowners. Not counting the student population, the Gville MSA has one of the highest poverty rates in FL. Much of the non-student workforce is un/under-skilled and technical/trade training opportunities are few. Despite the large healthcare presence, chronic diseases like diabetes, hbp, heart disease and a high rate of obesity affect a significant part of the population and interventional outcomes are fair to poor. All of these troubles and more will keep Gville from ever reaching full potential. It's sad because things could be so much better and, with the right guidance, Gville could easily compete w/ similar sized progressive cities.

A PREASSURE WASHER WOULD BE NOCE EVERY NOW AND THEN!  but really. Ever been to Ann Arbor?    The houses are also kinda shitty. The neighborhoods are all covered in beautiful trees which I love but most places don't have sidewalks or curbs which okay, some places don't have that and are still nice. But the architecture here is prevalently kinda run down block homes. Look along 34th. 6th. 23rd. Even university. Lots of poorly kept homes. Algae and moss everywhere. Cars in the yard and nobody spends money on landscaping. I'm not even talking about the rentals.   Downtown is getting better since we came back but it has more to do with the residential situation. Arts are okay but honestly feels second rate.   What could a city do about this?  Policies?  Code enforcement?    And GRU has a poor defense talking about costs front loading over the life of the biomass because most people won't stay longer than the break even. So it dries people away.

It is a growing city, but I agree with some of the comments on here that it's taking away from what Gainesville is.  I grew up here, and half of my family belong to 5th generation cattlemen, and the other are local business owners, so I'm on the fence.

Gainesville was 90k in the 1990 census and 130k in the 2010. Essentially in the last 20 year it grew by half again its population. In 1995: there were still industrial trains running through downtown at 6th street, the entire archer road interstate exchange (cracker barrel, steak&shake, several hotels, etc) was undeveloped because there was nothing built between the interstate and tower road, there were ghettos all along 2nd ave and off of 13th street.

A lot of the growth in gainesville proper could have been due to annexation.  I came here in 2000 and there really hasn't been any growth that I can point to since then.  Cracker barrel was there already.  Maybe I am slightly off but not as wrong as you are making me out to be.  Yes we built some new apartments but that didn't create growth in terms of population just shadow housing inventory."

You essentially doubled the actual size of the city. Those other 120k people live in other towns and cities in the county like Newberry or Alachua. From your first post, Nashville has 660k people, or about 5x the population of Gainesville.

A deputy said the unidentified man was taken to the hospital, where he reportedly was being treated for three gunshot wounds.  The incident began around 3 p.m. when the man leaped over the counter at the North Main Street Post Office, 1401 N. Main St., and demanded the cash boxes, according to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.  After multiple calls to the Gainesville Police Department, the agency requested assistance from the ASO, which happened to have canine units training in the area.  Deputies say they saw a man fitting the description of the reported suspect riding a bicycle north on Main Street. They saw him ride into the parking lot of Winn Dixie just north of Northwest 23rd Avenue and pulled in behind him.  It is unclear who shot first, as witnesses told deputies they saw the man fire a gun and at least one of the deputies shot at the suspect. No other injuries were reported from the gunfire.

BTW more info  https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=852722254764037   GAINESVILLE, FLA – A Gainesville man is dead following a late night shooting in the Pine Ridge neighborhood. At 10:16pm Monday, GPD received numerous 911 calls about a shooting in front of 2425 NW 57th Place.  There were reports that a man had just been shot and that the suspect had run away.  Police arrived immediately and located James L. “JoJo” Rentz, 37 on the ground suffering from apparent gunshot wounds.  Officers attempted emergency trauma first aid and Rentz was transported to UF Health/Shands where he died as a result of the gunshot wounds.  Rentz lived at this address and was reportedly returning from a nearby store at the time of the shooting. Several 7.62mm shell casings were found at the scene.  A K-9 search from the crime scene located a Romanian Draco AK pistol near the entrance of the Pine Ridge neighborhood.  The weapon was fully loaded with 2 magazines.  It is believed that this weapon was the one used to kill Rentz. GPD investigators have been working around the clock to identify the shooter and those efforts will continue today.  At this point there is no information on the possible suspect.  GPD also said that patrols in the area will increase following this incident. AK pistols, such as the one used in this homicide are fairly unusual and police are hoping someone may have knowledge about who has been seen with such a weapon.  They are asking the public to reach out with information that may help solve the case."

While I'd normally prefer to use local businesses, I admit that I do most of my basic printing at Office Depot. They have a student discount that's ridiculous, so if you have a student ID (or can get someone who has one to go in for you), get a quote there. I've printed flyers, small posters, and had spiral bound print-outs done, too. As an example on price, I had a bunch of spiral bound print-outs done that would normally have cost over $100, and I paid $35 with the student discount. The quality is good but not great - in my experience, I'd put them on par with Target but not as good as Renaissance. They don't have the extensive selection of paper products that Renaissance/Target have, either, although they do have a selection of many colors and several weights. They may have other forms of discounts that you could ask about, too.

GNV,35ja20,Correctbear1,2,Sun May 10 23:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, very. Commander is a very casual format, many of our players haven't been playing long. Everyone is very accommodating, and games are multiplayer, which means that players won't go after you immediately if you deck doesn't seem that threatening.  We also have many individual cards and full decks available for people to borrow if you would like. In addition, the prize for winning a game is to get a discount on good commander cards, so that should make it easier to supplement your collection.  There really isn't a meta. Since there are so many available cards and each deck must have 100 separate ones, there is a huge amount of variation. There is no ""best deck"" or ""best commander"", at least not in multiplayer play. There are people who play competitive 2-player commander, but that's a completely different format."

Testing at the GYT program (the one located in the basement ""Red Team"") used to be free, but now there is a $15 handling fee, which I believe can be billed to your ISIS account. They will only see you if you are not having symptoms, since you don't see a healthcare provider. You can also get testing done in the Women's Clinic (women only) or your assigned primary care team (anyone). If you have insurance, the tests can be billed to insurance. Testing is often covered, but it varies by plan. If you have no insurance, or if it's not covered, your account will be billed, and it's about $100. If you have insurance, but prefer not to use it, there is a confidential self-pay option which is even more expensive.  Source: SHCC employee"

Arcade bars sound fucking awesome, and if you have staff who know what they're doing and a passionate owner, they can be viable [look at the 1up and 2up arcade bars], but it will be a super hard road, and an expensive one at that... especially if the answer to either of those questions is ""no"".

GNV,3540ku,karnim,1 point,Sat May 16 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the execution. There is a fine line between people who would go once or twice for novelty purposes, and people who would frequent for gaming events. There seems to be a divide in these people, hardcore gamers and people who like to play arcade games while they drink. Now, alcohol has to be a main focus, because this will be the primary source of income. However, how do you keep the divide equal enough for both parties to enjoy the space. Many gamers I know, the kind who would enjoy the LANs, would not exactly enjoy the ""bar"" feel. And groups of drinking buddies may not want to go somewhere that feels like a gamer hangout/clicky. (I know this all sounds VERY stereotype but hear me out.) This is why you need a space big enough that you can have a popular bar where the seating for gaming is farther away for people who want to enjoy the games without roudyness. Now, the arcade games can be closer to the bar, perhaps hold competitions for highscores to win free drinks, pay to play in LANS in a separate area for cash prizes or bar tabs. A Rock Band karaoke night. Themed nights that if you come in cosplay you can get in free or a free drink.  Things that can keep it fun and make people feel like a kid, but include the bar at the same time. People can then make their choice, based on the night, what kind of crowd they want to be around. I think you would be surprised, there are a lot more ""gamer"" people in Gainesville than you think, and most college kids here were young during the 90s for atleast the nostalgia of n64 and super nintendo. A lot of my friends don't play very many video games, but you better believe that if I invite them over for a beer/ smash, mariocart, rockband, mario party, even Halo etc. They are always down. For these competitions, you can use ""sharing"" the event on facebook as an entrance fee for free advertisement. I think this is exactly what Gainesville needs, it is a city in which it is constantly replenished by young faces. It would be a BIG investment to make it work properly. You cannot just add another bar with a few games, this has been done multiple times with mediocre results. If someone decides to go through with it, it would be a big project that would need to be heavily thought out and planned. I honestly hope to see something like this in the future. I know I can think of a large group of people who would join me there for a drink often."
GNV,3540ku,Baldeez,2,Sun May 17 21:18:50 2015 UTC,"The problem is, commercial rent is expensive.  It is even more expensive in areas where this sort of thing would be most viable... On top of that expense, a liquor license is also very expensive and hard to get.  Then you add on the amusement licenses for every machine, taxes, etc... and you are paying a lot of money just to have a building and stay legal.  While I believe there are a lot of people in town who would be interested in such a place, I don't think that there are enough people with deep enough pockets to sustain it.  The Bud Light crowd isn't.  Truth is, I've owned a business here dealing specifically with gamers, I have some experience dealing with state and local licensing, I have secured leases on commercial property in the area... and I wouldn't dump the huge amount of money needed into this sort of venture because another dive bar with live music would make as much, or more money.  That doesn't mean I don't like the idea.  I would love to have a good barcade, but I also don't want someone to assume things will work out and lose their shirt without some real serious thought on the matter."
GNV,3540ku,Marchingants,1 point,Sun May 17 21:44:17 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, in that case, your experience is far more insightful than some girl who has never ran a business, let alone even weighed out the costs of doing so."

I would really love to open an arcade here and let more people enjoy the machines I own, but every time I sit down and say ""I should do this"" I remind myself that every single machine has to earn me $234/year just to pay it's rent [based on the state average rental price... and that's only for the space it occupies].  That's a lot of quarters.  Then you pile on taxes and maintenance costs and every machine ends up needing to earn a lot more to justify being there... and that doesn't even account for the areas which aren't occupied by a machine but still need to be paid for.  It really sucks, and if someone can pull it off, I applaud them... but it will be a hard road and they will likely lose a lot of money before making any back."

Gaming establishments have come and gone in this town but no one to my knowledge has ever introduced alcohol. Actually, the old purple porpoise (gator city now?) used to have an arcade in front but that was never the sole draw of the establishment.   The only way to really pull this off without dumping more than a half million into it would be to buy out a failing bar with an existing liquor license.   Ample parking and an arms length distance from the usual nightlife would be much better."

I've been here almost 10 years and restaurants and bars come and go very frequently so market research is key. Location research is paramount in this market and midtown is not always the best bet. Butler Plaza has tons of traffic and is close to the main off-campus housing areas, but there are numerous cons there as well. Successful marketing is also key in a place like Gainesville due to the market saturation. Use the University, fliers, mailers, etc. to keep your name out there. People have lots of options and need a constant reminder of your presence. I would love to see an establishment like this thrive! I wish you the best of luck."

Since I moved to my present house 13 years ago I had trouble with it for a few months when it was rainy, but that was several years ago. It has worked perfectly ever since.  I can always hear the other caller, there are no echoes, no dropped lines of course, and often on long distance calls the clarity is unbelievable and it seems like the person is in the next room.

Yes, it's an older complex, but it is not run down. The maintenance staff is competent enough to keep everything in working order and the office staff is always on top of any issues that arise. They are also in the process of repainting/finishing the buildings so they (the buildings) will soon be a very soothing ocean blue. I will admit its' amenities fall short of many of the student oriented complexes that surround it (Enclave, Oxford Manor etc.). Although, the inclusion of gator.net internet is a huge selling point (50mb/s).  All my neighbors are either friendly or quiet. I have yet to have issues with anyone from the complex. Student population is also fairly low so it's usually quiet.  As for location, it can be a pain in the ass to get to and from the complex. Primarily because Florida has some of the worst drivers I have encountered and they all come out around 3:30pm to turn Archer into a shit show. I have never seen so many absent-minded, texting addicted, and outright aggressive drivers in my life. It really makes me miss California driving. Access to the largest shopping center is a plus. Be warned though, the traffic in that center can be horrendous too.  Overall, I would recommend Brandywine as long as you're not looking for the red carpet to be rolled out.

GNV,34p43t,demures,2,Sun May 3 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"Hey man, thanks for the info and the links, I'll check them out. Just FYI, it's 475 per person (including utilities), the cost for a furnished 2/2 is ~$800 (w/o utilities).  I have another guy from India, and we're both looking to share a place to lower the costs, so if you know any 2/2s under 1000 that are decent, please let me know. How about Oxford Manor, or the Landings, or Greenwich Greens?"

GNV,34p43t,demures,1 point,Tue May 5 21:04:11 2015 UTC,"I live in campus club, they are definitely better than Brandywine. And don't go by the ratings alone. Very few people rate apartments and among the people who rate them, it's probably just the ones who don't like the apartments.   Edit: I lived in Stoneridge, University Terrace on sw 34th and Gateway at Glades. Stoneridge management was fine too, they responded to most of the service requests a day or two."
GNV,34p43t,tadees,1 point,Tue May 5 21:09:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense! So far, I've been basing my assessments on those two websites alone. Kinda hard to get a feel for a place from 15k km away :).   And all of these places - Stoneridge, UT, GaG, CC - are much better than BW? And not 'ghetto' or unsafe, or some such?"
GNV,34p43t,rodtrusty,1 point,Tue May 5 21:19:45 2015 UTC,GaG and BW are comparable but I found both their living rooms to be small for my liking. Stoneridge is a good place and cheaper but unfurnished. UT apartments are good but they don't have a leasing office and are owned by individual owners.  Campus Club has a better overall vibe and the staff are friendly.

Otherwise, just google the apartment name, ""gainesville fl,""and ""crime"" to see what pops up."
GNV,34p43t,canyoucanoe-1,1 point,Tue May 5 21:49:21 2015 UTC,"Lived in Brandywine for a short time in 2007 yello, so it'd be hard to give a solid opinion given my outdated timeline.  That said, the location isn't to bad.  It's within walking distance (~.5 mile) to the biggest shopping area in Gainesville (Wal-Mart, groceries, restaurants...everything).  It's also across a 4-lane road from a rear entrance to campus (the SW side).  You may want to check where your grad school is located and see if that's suitably close for you; getting from one side of campus to the other can take some time, even by vehicle.  Because of the cheap rent and loose rental requirements, BW often finds ""questionable"" tenants.  Plug ""Brandywine"" into the local newspaper search engine and you'll see what I mean.  There is one entrance to BW from the main road, but there is another complex behind BW as well, so there's a steady stream of traffic pretty much at all hours.  Being 6'3"", 300 lb white guy, I didn't get messed with a lot, but I did have some friends who were harassed occasionally in the laundry room and the clubhouse/pool area. Likely to find that wherever ya go though, so... If you come across any ideas or other areas and want an opinion, shoot me a PM. Be happy to help if I can."

From their site:   ""That was wrong. We apologize. Without reservation.""   They've never apologized before, instead they've flirted with grey areas of the law and ignored/bullied artists and labels. I don't for a moment believe they didn't know they were screwing people over, nor do I believe their apology now is sincere. Apologizing after a multi-million dollar lawsuit begins to find you at fault doesn't really count for much."
GNV,34gy5x,safariari,16,Fri May 1 12:26:52 2015 UTC,"Apologizing was probably part of the settlement too.  It's gotta be said though that the actual harm they caused musicians is probably pretty insignificant, and they paved the way for Spotify and all the rest which put an end to music piracy an a massive scale.  I don't think streaming music would be a thing if Grooveshark hadn't gone up against the labels."
GNV,34gy5x,canyoucanoe-1,10,Fri May 1 02:16:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this. Grooveshark was the first to challenge the Pandora model of the time and was punished heavily for doing so. They did try to get licensing for their music at first, but the labels wouldn't budge because, well, they didn't need to. But Grooveshark pressed on and influenced the market to the point that it forced the industry's hand into accepting the terms from Spotify, Rdio, Beats, and the like."

When they deleted their facebook page today the event page for tomorrow's show went with it, so the hundereds of people who were planning to attend via that event page won't be getting reminders and also might be thinking that the show is off due to Groovy's departure.

Part of my recovery plan is a lot of walking to remain mobile and I'd love to have a K9 companion just to keep things fun. I'd be willing to do it for free if you live close to Main St and 16th Ave as I always walk down down to and around the Sweetwater Preserve, otherwise I'd just look for some gas money.

Summer A gives like 4 or 5 classes a week for 6 weeks for about 300 dollars. That's going to be hard to beat price/hour wise.

I've been to the Chiropractor in the past and after my first visit I immediately felt pain relief and actually got a bit taller from my neck pulling back up into its correct position.  From what I understand and have noticed first hand is that if you have a C1 misalignment you need to have it adjusted,  then keep up with massages and PT to help your muscles release. Otherwise I'd assume it would take forever just doing the PT route.  I'd love if a normal Dr had a solution to offer me, but in essence it's not really an injury per se with your C1, it's the fact it's kinda free floating between your C2 and skull and there are a hundred or so ways it can become misaligned. I'm seeing my Dr again on Friday to have her prescribe me the PT and massages again and I'll ask her if there are any other alternatives I should be looking at."

GNV,34ax86,chubigans,5,Fri May 1 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I doubt that demolishing a pool that old will make your property value plummet. You'll probably also be able to cut your homeowner's insurance too.   Properly demolishing it will cost a pretty penny, but probably worth it given the size. You could rent a concrete saw and a few sledgehammers, but believe me when I say that's going to be the biggest pain in the ass you've ever undertaken. You'd also need to get someone to haul a few tons of concrete and rebar, and then backfill the hole.  You could probably try just burying it, but I'm not sure of the legalities/permitting around that."
GNV,34ax86,cushtopher,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"And actually, you'd still have to do at least some demolition to the pool if you wanted to TRY and backfill it. You'd need to punch some holes in the bottom of the pool so groundwater could flow in and out."
GNV,34ax86,cushtopher,3,Wed Apr 29 18:38:55 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone for your comments. You're all confirming my hunch - the pool should go. I was just out in the yard looking at it and thinking how nice a 10 x 20 screenhouse with a woodstove would be in that space...
GNV,34ax86,optionalmorality,3,Wed Apr 29 19:08:25 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be too worried about losing property value. A pool generally doesn't even add its construction cost to the value of a home when installed
GNV,34ax86,FL_Sportsman,2,Wed Apr 29 19:20:51 2015 UTC,I switched my pool over to a salt water system 3 years ago and my maintenance is very minimal now. I add a couple bags of salt every month and little acid. If it needs plaster or is cracked fill it. Do not drain your pool. Florida has a high water table and the pool can actually pop out of the ground from pressure. Demolitions is easy and you already have a hole to throw the crap in. my neighbors filled theirs after it developed a crack. pools suck.
GNV,34ax86,rudolf_the_red,2,Wed Apr 29 19:05:37 2015 UTC,You could always line it and make a nice aquaponics system out of it.  It would then double as a food source and natural pool.

GNV,3412uy,handlethatscandal,2,Fri May 1 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"No the businesses have to pay a lot more:   ""A bar cannot just order the $100 pay-per-view and show it on its televisions; it needs a licence to show the fight in public. G&G Boxing — the company selling the rights to show Saturday’s fight — reports the cost of the event “is determined by the occupancy of your establishment among other factors”. ESPN’s Darren Rovell reported the cost for this bout is $25 multiplied by the fire code occupancy of the location.  It varies. Bar owners and managers report numbers around that. A bar manager in Wilmington, Delaware, says his place was quoted $5,000 for a 257-seat occupancy (about $20 a head). Cardrooms in California have been quoted as high as $50 a head. A Buffalo Wild Wings in Henderson, Nevada, was quoted $4,500 to show the fight.""  Source"

I'm surprised that bars would charge a cover since there have been a lot of crackdowns on ""viewing parties"" (ex: ""Game of Thrones"" or ""Mad Men"") lately. I don't think a lot of viewing parties were charging covers, but the issue of showing a subscription service in a public establishment might be excarbated if there is a cover. I feel like not having a cover would make things less conspicuous. Since this is a one time event and not a weekly series it probably won't be that big of a deal, but you never know."

GNV,3412uy,atticuskraft,4,Mon Apr 27 23:14:05 2015 UTC,no offense to you because you just work there and have no control over the cover but that's just insane man. It's a $100 fight which at that ridiculous price would be covered by 4 people.   You'd be packed without a cover and make plenty of money and tips without the need for a cover.   It's just beyond greedy of ale house to try and charge that.   It's an easy way to lose business. Sure you'll probably sell all of those spots but I'll pass on that.  Most places are just saying get there super early or have a small cover.
GNV,3412uy,JKCIO,6,Tue Apr 28 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"yeah I agree dude. Our max occupancy is 285 so it costs us 3500 for the fight, so they're definitely making a profit off of this. Honestly, the past few big fight nights it has been a real sketchy crowd and a lot of actual fights happened, so I think they are trying to deter that this year."
GNV,3412uy,atticuskraft,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:16:44 2015 UTC,I completely get that but this just looks bad on their behalf as a business practice and I've already talked to multiple people who don't plan to go to ale house any longer due to this.  Hopefully no fights break out but I'm sure some of those bad apples would still pay.  I'd just get with a few buddies and split the cost and watch at home to avoid any of that
GNV,3412uy,JKCIO,2,Wed Apr 29 04:10:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah man idk why anyone would pay that much. Some dude called yesterday about coming in with 12 people.

Meadowbrook and the UF golf courses hold good sized bass.  (Stealth).  Turkey Creek Golf Course is closed and you can pull some nice ones there.  Just act like you belong there and you're cool.  There's a 'home' on NE 2 ave between 23 and 16 that has healthy bass. (Stealth).  Lake Alice has monster fish but they're well fed and well... (Stealth).  Check Watermelon Pond levels.  That was a blast to wade fish.  Nothing big, but high numbers. St. John's River.  Take hwy 16 to the shands bridge and enter the river on the sw side of the bridge. Beautiful wade fishing for bass, stripers and reds.  All the springs are wade fishable, but the water is super clear and people. Rodman Dam is a neat spot to fish.  Stripers, bucket mouths, cats, crappie...it can be a blast, even if crowded.  There are some 1/2 lb bass in hogetowne creek in the culverts and the dam, but you need a -small- rig.

GNV,341tkt,lthornton20,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:47:42 2015 UTC,if you really want to fish this area save up and by a little jon boat or kayak. You can fish fresh water but if you cant get away from where everyone else fishes your just gonna catch little pan fish mostly. A small paddle boat opens up all kinds of fishing especially in the gulf.   if you go to the pier at cedar key at night it is a great time. You can catch a large variety of stuff and listen to some good music from the bars next door. If you go during the day they have kayaks for rent. I know you said bass but its much better fishing over there.

Cool hidden spot for a picnic.   If you pick up the trail on the other side and keep going, there are these tall burns that go through some pretty cool swampish woods. I love running back there. Follow that trail far enough and it comes out on 62nd just south of the mall.  There are TONS of trails all over Gainesville, often hidden right off of main roads.

The first time, I pre-gamed a bottle of wine with a buddy, took the bus there, bought more alcohol, THEN bought food. It made waiting in line with friends a lot better. The second time around I was sober but enjoyed the music going on while I was in line. Lots of people alone on their phones though. The food is really overpriced but it's still pretty fun. When I go, it's not for the food specifically but for drunkenly waiting in line in a huge crowd and having some food I'd never even know existed."

GNV,33rprq,gagralbo,2,Fri Apr 24 23:56:58 2015 UTC,"If people go here for bike repairs doesn't that reduce the profitability of the  Pleasant Cyclery?  Did Ryan give up ownership of that even though he is a co-founder?  This seems like it is rival of Pleasant Cyclery and will reduce their and all other bike shop's income.   Also, Michael J. Fox first learned he had Parkinsons when he was filming the movie Doc Hollywood in Micanopy. He was 30 years old."
GNV,33rprq,whynotd,2,Sat Apr 25 00:46:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will reduce bike shop's income, it is its own niche, so to speak.  Bike shops have to turn away customers sometimes because they can't replace one broken part of a component system, but have to replace the whole thing. If the customer can't afford the cost to fix the entire thing then often the shops can't help them. Some folks cannot or will not pay the cost for that level of service. In general the bikes shops in town are fantastic and do absolutely fantastic work, but there is a gap they just can't fill.   The project aims to help very low income people, educate people about bicycle maintenance and safety, reduce waste and provide more cycling infrastructure and a space for the community to enjoy.   I'm not an expert here, but if you go talk to any of the folks in the video they would be able to explain it much better than I can.   I also can't speak for Ryan's future plans for Pleasant Cyclery, another good reason to stop by Freewheel (he's there nearly every night and usually all day Sunday/Monday). But, if you visit the shop you'll see that he's leaning more toward new bikes than he has in the past."
GNV,33rprq,josephbikes,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:58:45 2015 UTC,"As far as repair work and bike sales go, Freewheel is aiming to provide service to the type of people who shop at Wal Mart, not local bike shops. I worked in local shops for about three years, and there are always customers who will not pay more than $150 for a bicycle. Bike shops start at about the $300 price point. What do they do? Go to Wal Mart and buy something that will last six months. Since Freewheel is a non-profit, they can afford to supply people with sub-$200 bicycles to get them on the road. They won't be selling any sort of high quality or performance driven bikes, just affordable machines to get people on the road.  And as far as repairs go, you should always pay a professional mechanic to rebuild your suspension fork, fine tune your gears, or install critical new components. Freewheel exists for those who can't afford it, and who don't necessarily care about top-notch quality work. In terms of repair work, Freewheel is filling the gap that was left by the Kickstand. Nearly every other cycle-centric town I've been to has had a successful bicycle cooperative... it's time for Gainesville to step up."

GNV,33ncwv,Incazteco,3,Sat Apr 25 01:30:26 2015 UTC,Nicotine itself is NOT a carcinogen.  If it has become so recently than you may want to alert the CDC so they're aware.  DR

GNV,33ncwv,Incazteco,0,Sat Apr 25 01:48:10 2015 UTC,"youre being downvotes because you said smoking. Using an e-cig or ""vape"" is not smoking, it's vapor.  Plenty of studies have been done proving they're not near as bad as cigarettes and as someone who vapes I can account to that.  I used to smoke a good deal of cigs and could barely run, had a lot of sinus infections, and got nose bleeds.  Since I've switched I can now bike long distance without losing breath, can breath much better, my taste and smell senses are much stronger, and no more sinus infections.  Tldr: it's vapor not smoke and it's proven to have health benefits ""compared"" to smoking.  It's of course not completely healthy but far better than smoking."
GNV,33ncwv,Incazteco,0,Fri Apr 24 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"Seeing as nicotine itself is carcinogenic in no way is vaping any ""healthier"" than smoking. Please source your ""studies"" if they exist."
GNV,33ncwv,FL_Sportsman,-2,Fri Apr 24 22:12:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the source. Many of these studied have used a small population (low statistical power) over a small period of time where many manifestations of cardiac disease and cancerous growth cannot be observed. Please take any conclusion made by studies such as these with a grain of salt as this is the problem with the studies listed on this website. I'm sure over the years we will have many more studies conducted that will show the true nature of e-cigs, while not as harmful as cigarettes, still being unhealthy.  To answer your question no I am not against the use of other modes of nicotine ingestions such as the patch or gum as they have their uses in medicine (such as bridge therapy during lengthy hospitalization.) E-cigs are a better alternative than cigarette smoking, but have been shown to not help patients in quitting the smoking habit. Smoker who do go from cigarettes to e-cigs have switched one addiction for another. Long term use of these methods are unfavorable to actual cessation of all nicotine containing products."

If you do go that route, I'd suggest looking for a unit that is on the top floor.

GNV,32wlwn,bnasty7,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:53:36 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue a few years ago - lawn mostly brown, huge dead spots even. I spent a few hundred dollars trying to fertilize and whatever else myself, but nothing was working. I hired Massey (I'm sure they are all the same) and within a few months my lawn was green again, and the dead spots were filling in. It looks great now. I pay about $400 a year for it, but I would have to spend that anyway if I wanted to buy the stuff myself, and I had no idea what I was doing. Some of the huge dead spots in the corners even filled in about a year later."
GNV,32wlwn,sk1dmarc,0,Sun Apr 19 14:10:01 2015 UTC,I pretty much had the same issue.  I have St. Augustine grass as well.  I ended up having to hire Trugreen.  My lawn looks awesome now.  It's a little pricey though but it's worth it.  I pay $58 every 7 weeks I believe.  Call around and ask other similar businesses.
GNV,32wlwn,rightc0ast,0,Fri Apr 17 12:26:50 2015 UTC,"Search for lawn doctor. They are way, way better than trugreen. No idea if they are in gainesville though."
GNV,32wlwn,BonfireinRageValley,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:11:22 2015 UTC,Well Trugreen is a massive company that spends loads on R&D so if you had a bad experience it could have just been a bad specialist. Which OP would also run the risk with Lawn Doctor.
GNV,32wlwn,rightc0ast,0,Fri Apr 17 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"No bad experience. Lawn doctor uses better equipment to deliver better product. They cost more though. They may not be in this area however. If theh are, it beats liquid application. Even if you go with the pelletized chemlawn service, they use inferior hand spreaders and lower nitrogen less burn risk slow release. It saves cost, but at thevexpense of quality."

We had been beefin' with this other dance crew from down the block.  We really needed a fresh new look to serve Electro Rock.  TBH, neither Ozone or I were very sure of Kelly's abililty to adapt to our style of street/urban dance and her instructor certainly did not approve of our hybridization of jazz and breakin'.  Sometimes I think he just hated Ozone and me, but we put our bandanas on and trained hard as fuck. At first, I think people just thought Kelly was a novelty part of the act, but then we all realised the true value of Kelly and her abilities.

No, federal and state studies have consistently shown that the drivers most likely to get into accidents in traffic are those traveling significantly below the average speed. According to research, those driving 10 mph slower than the prevailing speed are more likely to be involved in an accident. That means that if the average speed on an interstate is 70 mph, the person traveling at 60 mph is more likely to be involved in an accident than someone going 70 or even 80 mph."

Now we can't do that.  I've had 3 students turn up pregnant this year.  This is a new policy so I can't blame it on Dr. Roberts but it goes to show you what's happening.

How is that right?   thets throw condoms at them and see if it teaches them to do it safely next time.   That isn't actually how it is done.   Not to instruct them on moral situations.   Safe sex is not a ""moral situation"".  If a parent wants to tell their child that abstinence is the only right thing, that is their prerogative. When their child, a young adult/adult, decides to not listen to their parents when it comes to whether or not they go to church, whether or not they eat broccoli, and whether or not they can curse at home, that is an issue between them and their parent.   When it comes to sex, it isn't just between the parent and child anymore. If the child is going to do it anyway, against their parent's wishes, then they should know to how to, and be provided the materials to, engage in it safely.  Heck, maybe some extra education and a show of how much preventative measures matter, might even get them to abstain for a little longer. Maybe not, maybe they'll just end up having sex without pregnancies and without STIs.  I believe some parents can, and do, teach their children about sex properly. Even very religious ones. There isn't anything wrong in teaching about sex while having Christian values. However, there are far too many parents (Christian or otherwise) who cannot or will not provide a proper education for their children when it comes to sex."
GNV,32cns5,kristoferen,-12,Mon Apr 13 04:13:30 2015 UTC,I just flat out dissagree with you morally thats its cool to have premarital sex. Unfortunately you are unknowingly propagating your idea of safe sex being ok by providing condoms in a grade school.

But because you disagree with it, doesn't mean we all should. You have just stated your opinion. We're all entitled to ours and they are just as valid as yours.  But years of studies have shown abstinence education does not work. In fact, teen pregnancy is highest in states that teach abstinence-only. New Hampshire teach students about condoms, how to use them, how contraception works, and most schools there allow students access to condoms. And guess what? New Hampshire has the lowest teen pregnancy rate in the nation. Mississippi has the highest, and guess what they teach: abstinence-only.  So, while your opinion is totally valid and I understand your point, studies have proven that correctly education youths and providing them access to condoms have drastically reduced unwanted teen pregnancy."

We're talking high school, where many ""kids"" are actually adults according to the law.  Propagating the idea that safe sex is OK by providing condoms? Really?

Yes they are having sex.  Yes they are getting pregnant.  Schools don't ""throw condoms at them.""  School nurses, who according to law, are allowed to counsel students on health related issues, including sex, had condoms available at students' request.  There has not been a school wide program of teaching kids to make moral decisions or teach behaviors related to sexuality.  What there has been, is a safe, non-judgmental place for students to ask for condoms and information about sexual safety.     hey that's my kid, I have the right to discuss sexual behavior and proper instruction. No need for a school to butt in with an agenda.   You do have that right, and we sincerely hope you exercise that right.  The school is not ""butting in"" anymore than having a library that owns a copy of a Stephen King novel is forcing students to read violent literature.    At schools, we want what is best for students.  We want them to be safe.  We want them to have resources to help them stay safe.  We want them to have the best chance they can at becoming productive adults who will benefit our society.  Teen pregnancy and STD transmission ARE problems.  You can't say they aren't.  Parents should and do talk to their children.  Kids often listen, but don't always want to fess up to their own activities.  I know I was close to my parents, who encouraged me to talk to them or my doctor when I was ready to start having sex.  Did I?  Heck no!  That would have been embarrassing.  Was I safe?  Yes.  Because I was able to obtain condoms without going through my parents.  That was embarrassing too, but at least my parents didn't know.    My point is, you can live in a fantasy land where you discuss topics with your kids, they never get conflicting messages from peers or media, and you are always the first place they go for advice.  I would love to live in that world as well.  However, even really smart kids from good families, whose parents are doing all the right things, are making really poor decisions.  Making it ANY harder for them to be safe while doing so is going to have consequences.    That is to say nothing of the children who don't have great home situations or other options for staying safe.  We as a community, and specifically, you and I as Christians, should only be interested in helping these students improve their chances at becoming productive, self-sufficient citizens who live with dignity.  Contracting an STD which will likely go untreated could be devastating to their lives.  Having a baby is an even bigger deal.  Most kids do not give children up for adoption, they keep the babies.  That reduces the chances that they will succeed in life drastically, and sets their children up for the same kind of situation later on.  Is that really something you see Jesus supporting?"

GNV,32cns5,MiT_Epona,5,Sun Apr 12 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"There are organisations that would be willing to do it. This isn't a money thing.   after Roberts found out during a meeting with health services and health department staff that condoms were being given out on campuses by nurses and about other advocacy groups distributing contraceptives on public school campuses, the superintendent laid down the law: no more condoms on campus, period.  “I just don’t believe it is the responsibility of the school system to do that,” Roberts said, explaining that parents should be able to make the call about whether their children should have access to condoms. “I just don’t believe we should cross that line.”   (Emphasis added)"

GNV,32cns5,doxsee,2,Mon Apr 13 03:04:43 2015 UTC,"Why not both? What harm is there in giving out condoms? Teaching abstinence isn't wrong, but teaching abstinence-only is.   in actual practice, abstinence-only programs often fail to prevent these outcomes [...] Schools and health care providers should encourage abstinence as an important option for adolescents. “Abstinence-only” as a basis for health policy and programs should be abandoned.  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X05004672   How many parents will provide their kids with a proper education about sex? Far from everyone. How many parents will actually help their kid get protection, or at least, the kind of parent that the kid would feel comfortable asking? Far from everyone.   I feel it is a parents responsibility to provide food, clothes, morals, and a basic education (among other things) to their children, yet there are plenty who do not. Plenty who can't even teach their children to read before they go to school."
GNV,32cns5,kristoferen,-7,Mon Apr 13 03:34:07 2015 UTC,"Nope, not both. Parents have a belief in how to raise thier child. There is no place for schools to alter or change the parental message to a child."
GNV,32cns5,doxsee,3,Mon Apr 13 03:42:39 2015 UTC,"Why is this the unique thing that parents alone should do and decide? If they want to teach their kids, they can homeschool them.   Some parents believe some weird wacky shit, but luckily there are some times when the benefit of society comes before personal choice. Why should parents be allowed to withhold vital information from their children? You don't need an education to be a parent.  Besides, the schools taught abstinence already. It was only if students sought out advice or protection that it was offered.  If the parents can't enforce ""no sex"" on their kids, why should they be allowed to enforce ""no condoms"" on their kids?"
GNV,32cns5,kristoferen,-6,Mon Apr 13 03:48:18 2015 UTC,"Sexual education is parental, not societal imo. Any failure in this from a parent to child is a family matter."
GNV,32cns5,doxsee,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:16:51 2015 UTC,"Care to explain why you think sex ed is purely a parental thing?  Do you not see how a failed sex ed. is a problem for society in some cases? (Society paying for the child/mother, society paying for STI treatments, other people getting infected, etc.)  From bible.org:   Most parents ignore or avoid this subject, and not many churches have excellent sex education programs. The result is that children pick up distorted information and immoral values from their peers, from television and movies, from popular songs, and from magazine racks.   again, from bible.org:   Few parents are really qualified to provide effective instruction in this area.   According to WHO:   In a study of 35 sex education programs around the world, the World Health Organization found there is no evidence that comprehensive programs encourage sexual activity.   Some more fun facts:   A 1999 survey conducted by Hickman-Brown Research Inc. found that 93 percent of all Americans believe sex education should be taught in high schools, and 84 percent believe it should be taught in middle or junior high schools.   So why is abstinence-only taught in FL? Well, there are conservatives, but there is also the Welfare Reform Act, but that is neither here nor there.  Anyway, lets go on. Here is a quote from The Vatican:   Let them be given also, as they advance in years, a positive and prudent sexual education. [...]The family which has the primary duty of imparting education needs help of the whole community. [...]  certain rights and duties belong indeed to civil society, whose role is to direct what is required for the common temporal good [...]    Here is some more from the Vatican, about schools teaching kids more than how to learn, about schools teaching values:   Among all educational instruments the school has a special importance. It is designed not only to develop with special care the intellectual faculties but also to form the ability to judge rightly, to hand on the cultural legacy of previous generations, to foster a sense of values, to prepare for professional life."

How are you going to beg people to fund your initiatives that go far beyond the reach of traditional education, and then cut something beneficial claiming it's outside the scope of traditional education.  He better teach parents how to teach their children about sex ed in his new Parent Academy."

While one of the passengers ran down to the closest gas station a GPD officer stopped behind the car with his lights on, put on his yellow vest, and made sure that they were able to fill up without anyone getting hurt or causing too much traffic disturbance.   I will admit that my initial reaction was to pull out my phone just in case I needed to record it, but I was glad to see such a serviceable officer helping with such an innocuous situation.  Back to the initial question though, police cams can do nothing but help everyone. They encourage EVERYONE to act civilized to one another. The small percentage of officers who are the problem are less likely to abuse their power, and pissed off citizens are less likely to file false reports. It's a win-win.

If you're going to vote in the current runoff (early voting ends Saturday, regular election is Tuesday), you can go to the clerk's desk and fill out a voter registration form at the same time.

Since you've also moved, you may need to vote in a different precinct. If that's the case, it's easier if you go to early voting (locations here). You'll fill out the form, they'll update your info in the system, and then you'll get the ballot for your correct precinct. If you go on Tuesday, I recommend calling the Supervisor of Elections on Monday to find out which precinct you should go to, then just show up there. You can fill out the form there, they'll confirm that you're in the right spot, and you can vote. If you go to your old precinct and it's no longer correct, they'll send you to the correct precinct, so it's a bit more of a hassle for you.  Source: I'm the clerk for a local precinct."

I prefer Ormond or Flagler Beaches, and you can get to the Ormond Beach city limits in under 2 hours and the actual beach in just about 2. Ormond tends to be less crowded, and Flagler (which is just north of Ormond Beach) even more so."
GNV,31wq6a,carlidew,7,Thu Apr 9 13:03:42 2015 UTC,"I've lived in the area off and most of my life. I wouldn't call Cedar Key a ""nice beach."" It is a nice place to visit if you want somewhere close-ish to walk around with a sea breeze in relative peace and quiet. Be careful with the local restaurants, especially in off season, as we've had food poisoning the last 2 times we went. Never had Steamers, and I have heard it recommended a few times. I prefer to go to the state parks out near St. Augustine.  Washington Oaks State Park is great! Beach side has coquina ""tide pools"" and park side has gorgeous ponds and gardens. Little Talbot Island also has trails, a drift wood beach, and a beach for nature watching. Also a pretty neat camping spot."

GNV,31vj52,furryoso,3,Wed Apr 8 16:18:52 2015 UTC,I care... it should be closed. The school district receives more than 50% of my property taxes and haven't been excellent in the handling of tax payer money.  This closure makes financial sense and benefits the county as a whole. We don't have city / town schools... we have county schools.
GNV,31vj52,furryoso,2,Wed Apr 8 14:50:07 2015 UTC,Hey! Do you know if there are other schools nearby where these 200+ students can attend if this closes down? Will current teachers/staff be left without jobs?
GNV,31vj52,Andreww_ok,7,Wed Apr 8 14:57:06 2015 UTC,"Do you know if there are other schools nearby where these 200+ students can attend if this closes down?   Your nearby is a caveat... First, let's go over some background.  Waldo is a town of just over 1,000 people. In essence, the entire town of Waldo is less than 0.5% of Alachua County and less than 50% of the attendance of Buchholz High School (to put it in perspective).  Waldo is only 12 miles from Gainesville. Currently for middle school and high school, residents of Waldo use Hawthorne Middle/High School (which is about 16 miles from city center).  So, to answer the question other schools nearby where these 200+ students can attend ... Yes. Although it is less than 200 students. It's 193, a drop of over 9% from 2009.  The plan suggested is for the students to use Shell Elementary in Hawthorne. This is very close to where current middle school and high school residents of Waldo go. Shell was chosen since it has better facilities than Waldo.   Will current teachers/staff be left without jobs?   You must assume that some people will lose jobs.    Teachers who have achieved the equivalent of tenure will be guaranteed jobs in the district, and other Waldo teachers will be able to get district teaching jobs unless Burton doesn’t recommend them for a contract renewal, he said.  “There’s no intent that anyone will lose their job,” Roberts said."

GNV,31ppn1,notastudentgville,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:07:36 2015 UTC,34th is complete shit at times. I like behind butler plaza and from nw 43rd at to there can take me 20-25 minutes on Fridays.   Some days it's not too bad but others it's just beyond ridiculous.   Newberry can be the same at times.
GNV,31ppn1,JKCIO,1 point,Fri Apr 10 14:41:50 2015 UTC,"Sunday is usually not too bad, actually. I think it depends more on the time of year (i.e., football season has worse weekend traffic than the spring). Naturally, though, this weekend is the Orange and Blue game, so there may be more people here than any other spring weekend.  That said, there will be less traffic if you drive through before 11:00 AM or after 3:00 PM. In my experience, 11:00 to 3:00 seems to be the busiest time, but it also depends on which part of town you'll be driving through."

One comment though on the general barber scene. I wasn't able to find a barber capable of cutting styles like a Philly fade or tape up with hip hop lines.

GNV,31k0h6,commiecat,4,Mon Apr 6 03:46:49 2015 UTC,I hope that the straight razor shave is as classy as the man's modus operandi appears.   As a straight razor enthusiast I was hoping he'd have actual shaves listed on his site.  Seems he only uses the open blade during hair cuts for the back of the neck and part lines.  Really minor point but I appreciate that his logo in the video is of the disposable straight razors that barbers use nowadays.   I wasn't able to find a barber capable of cutting styles like a Philly fade or tape up with hip hop lines.   I have no first-hand experience but there's a shop off 6th called Fades and Fros that you might want to check out for that.
GNV,31k0h6,yeahthatguyagain,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:56:32 2015 UTC,I didn't do too much digging because of a lack of time so I assumed he had actual shaves as well. Maybe as demand grows.

You can get pads for about $50 for the front, $40 for the rear, and rotors (if you need them) will run you about $75 a pair on Amazon. So anywhere from ~$100 to ~$250 to do them yourself. Where most places will charge you double to triple that to do the work for you. Changing your breaks is really simple to do, and really difficult to fuck up.

If not, but only if you try the other two, copy talk (transcription place) will probably hire you (boring as hell though). Now, the last place you could try is the UF survey center, they hire pretty much everyone (it takes a while because of how they schedule training) but the place sucks. So I would not do it unless the other option is homelessness."

They really should find a way to better advertise the nature of their business, though. Maybe another sign that indicates that it's a coffee shop? Something that advertises specials or certain products?  Best of luck to them. Seems like an odd place for a coffee shop, since it's not an area with heavy foot traffic, and with it being several blocks from almost all other businesses (other than Ward's), they probably don't get much impulse business."

GNV,30tozz,gvillegamer2,5,Mon Mar 30 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"Depending on plan ($50 to $150) you get 10GB to 30GB of data at (up to) 12mbit down/3mbit up; after that you are limited to 1-5mbit which is barely enough for Netflix or YouTube or Twitch to stream smoothly.   Note: Satellite internet has high ping (response) times, which makes stuff such as online gaming near impossible and makes voice/video chat (eg. Skype) much worse than cable/DSL and possibly so bad as to be unusable. I would say you get closer to 1mbit than 5mbit once you exceed your data allotment.   If you want more ""high speed"" data it costs $10/GB.  If you can find a (true) unlimited 4G LTE data plan that might be another option.   ‘ping’ times will be in the 700ms range   Cable/DSL is usually less than 50ms. Anything over 150ms will make games pretty much unplayable. 700ms is absolutely unplayable.   It also makes remote desktop and VPN services perform poor enough to make them difficult or impossible to use.   ""Extreme weather"", eg. rain, will cause service disruptions or poor performance.   http://www.exede.com/customer-support/new-customers/what-to-expect  tl;dr: Exede is NOT a sufficient replacement for high speed internet as you likely are accustomed to.  Edit: You can view Exede speedtests done already @ http://www.speedtest.net/isp/viasat-exede Note that Williston is much slower than other Exede locations. They advertise 12mbps download for Gainesville, speedtest shows 9-10mbit which is probably realistic.  More tests @ http://testmy.net/hoststats/viasat_communication (Exede = ViaSat)  Edit 2: For reference, Netflix SD uses ~0.7GB/hr, and Netflix HD uses ~3GB/hr. New games (eg. Call of Duty, Wolfenstein, etc.) can have downloads of up to 50GB. Some games download large patches (WoW has had 10GB patches, for example). Sure you can download games/updates during the AM ""freebie"" hours across a couple days, but, yeah... Not optimal."

Finley Elementary school, hence the name)  There are also pickup games at Flavet field on the U.F. campus several days a week.

If you choose to seek care at UF health you can fill out a financial questionnaire to attempt to enroll in the charity care program, which uses a sliding scale of financial responsibility in relationship to income and dependents/outgo. The benefit of this would be once enrolled it offers (usually up to) six months of coverage usually with some medication coverage included. And establishing with a primary doc for follow up. As your rash is not acute or life threatening you can expect to wait for hours at the ER.  If you're a student both UF and Santa Fe have health services available at reasonable costs.  A new branch of the health department opened, where cost is usually not super high. A lot of uninsured people have lamented the distance from town and lack of transportation an issue, which the new clinic hopes to alleviate.  If you don't have a primary care physician established you would be referred to the health dept for any follow up needed anyway from the ED.  As mentioned above the care one clinics are roughly $100+/visit, but if you need a referral for a dermatologist you'll need another way to get that referral (i.e. ER visit/financial packet/establish in the system).

It's relatively cheap and easy to get if you qualify, just go to a Medicaid office:  http://www.healthcareforflorida.org/benefits  Edit: If you have no idea how subsidized insurance works, do not down vote this post as it will help the OP with information that could save his life. A lack of knowledge on health insurance programs and reflex to down vote anything we don't understand or can not compute will seriously harm anyone who can not find this information.  If you really need to go to the hospital, you can do so under a fictitious alias using a false address. It's how people without insurance are able to be treated without paying the hundreds of thousands of dollars they charge for gauze and bandages.  As far as ethics about dining and ditching, I'm not able to make any comments on any option you take. I just wanted you to k ow that if it's serious, you can go to the hospital instead of waiting it out and dying.

GNV,300cy0,Megalonyx,9,Mon Mar 23 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"The issue is due to the lack of Medicaid expansion in Florida there are plenty who don't qualify for Medicaid but can't get ACA lower cost plans. Definitely agree that this individual should see if they qualify for Medicaid, but it's super likely they fall into that gap where you're kind of fucked ATM in Florida.   Just salty about this as if I made a little bit less money, I wouldn't qualify for ACA lower cost plans, but would have no hope of affording any other kind of insurance. Entirely due to expansion of Medicaid having been denied in Florida, breaking how the system should have worked."

Up north around Panama Beach they are really nice also, but in between is mainly big time fishing area (Big bend, Cedar Key, Crystal River). In my opinion if your going to swim, the springs can be a better choice in our area to the west. Also, there are never waves on the Gulf, where as sometimes there are waves on the East coast (last year was horrible though).  So for Gainesville, the closest is the East Coast, and if you got kids it is generally easier than the 3 hours to Siesta. If your going for the weekend than the gulf is a great choice also. It is part of what makes Gainesville great, we have many options."

GNV,2zovxd,Phantom_Absolute,18,Fri Mar 20 11:57:37 2015 UTC,"Here's my letter to the Sun in response:  TED YOHO IS WRONG ABOUT THE INTERNET  Recently, Representative Ted Yoho penned an opionion piece explaining that the FCC recent reclassification of the Internet, protecting Net Neutrality, is a bad thing.  Ted Yoho is wrong.  First, the Internet is not 20 years old. Dial-ups existed in the United States more than 25 years ago, but that's another story.  The Internet was made possible today mostly from the initial support and research of tax-payer funded research, through DARPA and today exists as a globally distributed network.   Secondly, the FCC is not reclassifying the Internet. Again, the Internet is a global network. Instead, the FCC is guaranteeing open access to the Internet.  Recently, Internet service providers have been manipulating access to the Internet for economic gain. The most obvious access is Verizon's throttling of Netflix. Customers, who had paid Verizon to access the Internet, were unable to use Netflix because Verizon had demanded additional monies from Netflix.  Such access limitations are unprecedented and demanded action. The results of which  limit the capitalist values that Rep. Yoho claims to be protecting.  Lastly, although Rep. Yoho claims that there “is truly no limit to the amount of competition now present in the Internet marketplace,” he must not be aware of the actual limitations to Internet access imposed by our Federal, State, and local governments.  In Gainesville, the vast majority of residents have exactly one option for high speed Internet access. There is no competition present in the marketplace. The recent rule defining high speed Internet access means that AT&T's DSL service no longer classifies.  Many would argue that the lack of competition is the reason why AT&T has not improved their Internet speeds in more than 5 years.  In closing, when Representative Yoho claims that the recent FCC reclassification harms the ability of a buyer to buy what they want from a seller they want, indicates that the Representative has no understanding of the subject at hand.  It's sad that Ted Yoho has not listened to the many constituents, including me, that have expressed their feelings on this issue. When a Representative refuses to listen to their constituents and refuses to educate themselves on an issue, they are requesting a return trip home.  Perphaps. Representative Yoho should go back to discussing the President's birth certificate."

""There is truly no limit to the amount of competition now present in the Internet marketplace""  Okay, apparently he either doesn't have internet, or doesn't live in the US. He fails to mention how the current big ISPs have done everything they can to stifle competition, and enjoy a near monopoly on the market. The FCC ruling will require that ISPs share their infrastructure with other companies, so we will see a massive increase in ISPs, not the other way around.  And all these tax hikes he mentions? It's part of the Universal Service Fee, which ISPs choose to pass on to the consumer. They certainly don't have to.. Besides that, it should be a wash since ISPs will need to lower their prices to compete with the other companies. Think of how much less you would pay if you had 4-5 ISPs to choose from instead of 1-2. I'd welcome a tax since my overall bill would be significantly lower.   /u/steelie34       That unprecedented growth in the internet was because the internet was traffic neutral by design. It was only when corporations figured out how to hinder their competitions traffic for their own gain that we even began to discuss regulating. We are not regulating the internet to pick winners and losers, we are regulating the internet to avoid allowing corporations to pick winners and losers.  As for competition in internet providers that is a laugh. Most places have exactly one ""high speed"" provider that provides a few mega bits per second. You will be lucky to get even 6, unless of course you upgrade to their super duper high speed package at over a hundred dollars a month, and even then you will be lucky to get over 6 mega bits per second at peak times.   /u/slaves2darkness"

GNV,2zovxd,risto1116,0,Fri Mar 20 16:25:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not particularly active on this (or any other) subreddit, but I find net neutrality to be incredibly important. So I upvoted, specifically for visibility. Hopefully others did the same."
GNV,2zovxd,commiecat,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:38:53 2015 UTC,"Again, I totally get that. Here's the trouble I'm having:  This post got 34 total votes in under 3 hours (upvote/downvote... doesn't matter). That makes this the most voted on post this week... and it took under 3 hours to accomplish the feat...  But okay, let's just pretend every one on reddit upvotes purely for visibility.... We are a very small sub of about 3,800 people. So 0.009% of all subscribers to this sub voted on it - OR more surprisingly, all 'users here now' this morning. That would be like a /r/pics submission garnering 74,328 votes in 3 hours.   I know, these numbers are relatively meaningless... but I'm trying to point out how a post (ANY POST) would become absurdly popular THIS quick... let alone that this is a post about a congressman that is not popular on reddit, specifically /r/gnv, and written by a cable lobbyist (most likely)."
GNV,2zovxd,risto1116,0,Fri Mar 20 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen a single positive comment about it. If there had been new accounts posting about how wonderfully written it was, then yea you should be suspicious. But I think people legitimately upvoted it for visibility."
GNV,2zovxd,commiecat,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:58:24 2015 UTC,I upvoted it for visibility.  Are you suggesting that someone used the power of about a half-dozen accounts to game /r/gnv?  Heck at the time of this post there are about 20 people checking the sub.    I'm not a fan of Yoho and his statement that there's competition is laughable but the recent ruling is more about choosing the lesser of two evils to me.
GNV,2zovxd,openbluefish,-2,Fri Mar 20 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"Are you suggesting that someone used the power of about a half-dozen accounts to game /r/gnv?   I suppose. This is 1) a political opinion piece, 2) written (supposedly) by a very conservative Republican, 3) on a small-town subreddit with a common upvote amount maybe hitting double digits. Those three things alone make it so hard to believe that in 90 minutes, this post shot up to 11 upvotes and 0 downvotes. Then, when people begin downvoting it... it has remained at exactly 10 points (+17 / -7)?   Here's a post about Yoho a few weeks ago with 3 votes.  Here's an anti-Yoho article posted a year ago with 19 points.  Here's the 5th highest post this week - about politics no less - with the same amount of upvotes as this post but with a whole day to get those upvotes vs. the 90 minutes this one took to gain the same.  I mean, it's painfully obvious that someone flooded votes to this post. No political posts get THIS much attention THIS fast - regardless of their stance. Then factor in that this is pro-monopoly of internet service and written by a unpopular (to this sub) congressman, and some how tell me this got to the top of /r/gnv in that amount of time."

You have three confirmed upvoters in this thread as it is.  We're a fairly small sub and I can't imagine much benefit in manipulating votes on political articles, especially compared to the three much-larger subs that this specific article was crossposted to.  I don't conclude that it's upvoted because of agreement.  It's probably more to do with reddit's audience in general being tech savvy and, IMHO, this article shows a local politician's lack of knowledge on the topic.  Again, I really don't think common carrier status is as great as some are saying.  It's better than the duopoly that most places deal with today but I'm skeptical that we'll see any significant change in the near future."

The Alligator is completely run by students who, while they are journalism majors, are still learning. If you want to ask for a correction to be made, send a message to the Alligator staff and I'm sure they will be happy to look into making the correction.   A lot of times these stories are written based off what was put in the police report and whoever the reporters are able to maybe get in touch with under deadline, which usually means they only have a few hours.  I just want to point out that she does attribute the facts of her story; ""according to a police report"" and ""officers said"" are both pointing out where the information came from.  I understand using direct quotes from the police report is a bit misleading the way they were presented. I would have mentioned that they were from the report when I quoted them, yes. But she says several times in the story that she is referencing the report, so I think a reasonable deduction can be made."

That's not that far from average for municipal elections, if they're not paired with a presidential primary. <15% is normal, we've done even worse than 12.5%. The worst part is that it's probably intentional. I got excited when they proposed changing the elections to every other year in the fall, until I realized they wanted odd-numbered year fall elections, which would be just as low-turnout as spring elections, since they'd still be the only races on the ballot. There's a large contingent that doesn't want students involved, and students only turn out for the big ones - the Reitz Union precinct got 1% turnout this week."

GNV,2zkiqf,SoFar_Gone,3,Thu Mar 19 13:08:02 2015 UTC,"I would say community apartments would be much easier than private ones on craigslist.   Pavillion: I lived there when it was still called the district. Overall I never had any problems with it. Make sure you take many photos of everything before moving in because they did try to charge me for damage I did not cause. You would use the route 20 bus to get to campus. It runs very often, but gets very full at the Pavillion stop and sardine packed by the time you get on campus. The pavillion is the ""first"" big stop so its nice since youll always get on the bus going to campus. Catching a ride home can be annoying though. The 20 also runs by a grocery store, the mall, and connects easily to other buses to get downtown and main plazas.   Spyglass which has been mentioned is also really nice. The apartments are quieter and the staff is really friendly. I enjoyed living there more but you will have to pay the electricity/water seperately which might be a hassle for 6 months. The Pavillion (unless it's changed) includes electricity, water, cable, and internet in the price. There is a cap on the electricity but I never went past it.   Glades: I haven't lived here by I can tell you a bit about the area. The actually road it's located on is quieter than 62nd but the bus still gets busy. There are big apartments all down the road so at peak times you might miss a bus because it's full and glades is sort of towards the end. The bus also takes you to butler plaza which has many many stores and restaurants. It is super busy there but convienent. You can easily connect to some buses (butler plaza stop) to get downtown. Look at which apartment you'd be in because only their 3 bedroom option has private bathrooms and the 4 has shared bathrooms.   I think both locations are pretty good for a 6 month stay. They are busy areas and very student filled which can get old, but so easy to get around. Personally I recommend something on 20th or 62nd. Yes traffic can get bad but it's outweighed by only being one bus ride from the uf museums, large uf gym, grocery, mall, and center of campus."

But, if you don't have furniture you could always move in August to another sublet.

Her business cards, the staff directory, and website all had her email address listed. Turns out, she didn't know how to use it. She had hundreds of emails from students and she had no idea.  Also, tried to call in and get in touch with someone from the financial aid office. It was impossible. You have to go IN PERSON and wait in line, even if you have 1 question that should take 8 seconds. And the first financial aid lady I met with didn't know the answer, and she told me to call in to speak with someone else! I asked her to please try to do this for me, just so I can show her how difficult it is. When she did, she said ""Oh well, keep trying."" When I finally got my answer, it was after 11 days of calling and randomly driving in, and I got that needed paper on the last day it was due.  Those examples were within the same semester. I have about 15 more in the 2 years I was there. My Fiance is currently attending and she has eerily similar stories to tell. It's a mess.  Still, I enjoyed my time there.

The people at the front aren't actually financial aid advisors, they're just students with an on campus job. So they're knowledge is very limited, which has led me getting fucked over a couple of times.  Every now and then, ""Can I speak to an actually financial advisor"" has led me to actually speaking to one. They're the ones that actually know the system so they've always been of help. But it's not every time that I'm able to get one.  Boggles my mind, with just how important financial aid is, that that office can be such a mess.  My (limited) experience with the counselors also show they have limited knowledge. But honestly, from friends, that seems to be at every school. I can think of at least two different friends, both at different universities, who got fucked over from counselors suggesting classes that don't actually fit in their track.

Its main purpose is to prevent the international transport and spread of disease and insects that could negatively affect plants or ecosystems.  ISPM 15 affects all wood packaging material (pallets, crates, dunnages, etc.) requiring that they be debarked and then heat treated or fumigated with methyl bromide and stamped or branded,  with a mark of compliance. This mark of compliance is colloquially known as the ""wheat stamp"". Products exempt from the ISPM 15 are made from alternative material, like paper, plastic or wood panel products (i.e. OSB, hardboard, and plywood).

Gas pumps are really easy to break into and it takes about 5 seconds to install one of these once you're in.   If you want to be safe, use your card inside only. If you need to fill up they will usually let you leave your drivers license inside while they turn on the pump for you. You'll also usually see a seal over the door to the card reader. Obviously don't use a pump where the seal is broken or tampered with but also don't only trust these. Some of the scammers carry some convincing looking fakes with them.

There are other generics too, Wal-Mart has them and I'm sure CVS/Walgreens does as well.

GNV,2yw7bv,JapaneseClassesPlz,7,Fri Mar 13 09:27:31 2015 UTC,"You're looking for transient student enrollment, which is coordinated among the state universities and colleges by the Florida Virtual College website. Transient enrollment allows you to take courses at a state institution other than your ""home"" institution, without actually changing your home institution status. I.e., in your case, you can still be a degree-seeking Santa Fe student and take a single course (or a couple) at UF, without having to transfer to UF. Check out https://www.flvc.org/succeed-in-school/take-a-course-at-another-school for more info and to fill out the transient student admissions application.   Please, talk to an advisor at Santa Fe before you register for the UF course to ask about how transient student credits might affect you - for example, most colleges/universities have a policy about the number of credit hours you need to take at that institution to graduate, and transient courses don't count toward that number.   Also, financial aid does NOT automatically pay for transient courses since federal financial aid can only be used at one institution at a time and is given to your ""home"" institution. If you need assistance paying for your course at UF, definitely talk to financial aid at Santa Fe to figure out. There's a way to have financial aid pay for a transient course, but it's a bit complicated and requires special paperwork.  Source: Used to work in admissions/advising/financial aid for a state college (not Santa Fe or UF).  EDIT: Clarified some info"
GNV,2yw7bv,TheFinalFrontier47,3,Fri Mar 13 12:11:12 2015 UTC,"A word of warning, UF can be fairly unfriendly to transient students. When I was first attending UNF, I thought I would take a class over the summer at UF and live at home. I spent two days running around UF campus trying to get everyone they needed to sign off on my paperwork to sign.   In the end, the department chair in the college I was trying to take a class basically wanted to see my transcripts to make sure I should be allowed to take the class, even though my UNF counselor had signed off.  Ultimately it didn't matter because the paperwork said that you can't do transient enrollment at UF if you've ever attended UF or if you've ever applied and been denied admission to UF.   Just a heads up."
GNV,2yw7bv,thenarddog13,2,Fri Mar 13 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"Excellent point. Transient enrollment is definitely subject to the policies of each institution. OP, in addition to your advisors at Santa Fe, probably a good idea to check with UF also."

The majority of places in town that do rentals (men's warehouse, the bridal boutique, david's, etc.) are renting tuxes and very formal suits. This would work for a wedding or black tie event, but would incredibly out of place if you were to wear it to a nice restaurant, court, or a job interview.

GNV,2ymrbc,Neurokeen,13,Wed Mar 11 01:56:03 2015 UTC,"I can't speak much to housing, as I'm a renting yuppie chilling mostly with university-types and buying seems like some crazy future shit to me. But I can talk about everything else.  Electric and water are provided by GRU. Electric is pretty expensive, after all fees are assessed and everything, my bill averages around 15 cents a kWh (they strictly bill at 3-8 cents per kWh, but then tack on a bunch of fees). Water feels way less usurious,  looks like about $4.5/kGal of water, and about $8/kCal for wastewater average on my bills (again, after all fee assessments).  Internet gives you two and a half options right now. There's Cox, who's the main provider, and everyone hates, but that's ISP's for ya. Then there's AT&T who have service but not very high speed. GRU also has GRU.net, which offers fiber connection into a few specific residential areas. I'm reasonably certain that they're mostly apartments targeted at students, but don't quote me on that. I've never heard any complaints about GRU.net, but I don't know too many people that have them.  The food in Gainesville was a pleasant surprise when I moved here. I moved from Miami, and was outright anxious about sacrificing the palette I developed there. The Latin food suffers, there's no way around that. The one Cuban place everyone talks about (Flaco's) isn't worth a damn to anyone who's eaten in Miami or Ybor, there's one cafe (Mi Apa) that'll at least get you your fix. The Asian options are definitely interesting. There's plenty of cheap Thai and Japanese, and a couple of really good Chinese places. There's an awesome sushi fusion spot (with a world class bourbon bar--I'm not kidding, they've got two different Pappy Van Winkle bottles in stock right NOW, the 20yr AND the 23). There's a Jamaican place, a couple of places that I can only call American Hip-as-fuck food that are just great, several barbecues worth talking about. There's a couple of upscale places for a nice evening out with the SO. The bar scene in town is also fabulous: there's a whiskey bar, craft cocktail bar, a jazz bar (sorta), a speakeasy (again, sorta), cheap places, expensive places, whatever. Most of the dining varieties have a spot or two that clearly occupy the niche, but there's a lot of interesting niches. Plus there's a Farmer's Market with cool local food, and there's occasionally local food rallys and shit to explore new food options. I've really enjoyed exploring the food in town.  For spare time stuff, I know that there's a smallish gaming con in town annually, and there are a few places that do Friday Night Magic, I IMAGINE you can get some tabletop stuff going in those places if there isn't already. There are two notable breweries in town (Swamp Head and First Magnitude), both of which do the whole tour and tasting thing. There are plenty of bars, several of which even can cater to a less collegiate crowd. In particular downtown would be the place to drink if you're interested in a more professional crowd, although young locals still get down at several of those places. I don't pay much attention to clubs, but I know of at least one and I think there's one or two more. I know of at least one rock climbing gym, and I'm told there's another, though I don't think there's any natural rock to climb worth noting in the area. We're within a comfy day trip of Ocala National Forest, as well as several interesting local wild areas for day-hikes, there's a couple of great nearby springs for lazy days floating down the river in an inner tube (and it's easy enough to sneak in liquor, just don't be a dunce about it). I haven't camped in the area, but I know that there are camping areas at several of the outdoor spots I've just mentioned. I don't know anything about fencing, but I know that there are a few martial arts dojos in the area.  Basically what I'm saying is that Gainesville is a way cooler town than I expected it to be when I moved here."

GNV,2ymrbc,wmjbyatt,3,Wed Mar 11 03:45:51 2015 UTC,"So, to give ya a little detail, we have too places worth talking about regarding bourbon. There's Dragonfly, which is the place with the Pappy. I've had Rhetoric there, I've had George T Stagg, it's the fuckin' tits. But they have a rather narrow selection. They basically just stock the basics and then a few ultra-luxe bourbons. There's also Whiskey House, which has literally dozens of bourbons ready for you, with a much more interesting selection, just nothing as high-grade as what they offer over at Dragonfly.  Best news is that the two are within an easy walking distance from each other. So you can start your night off with some crazy good sushi and a tasting pour of a stupid good bourbon, then saunter on over to Whiskey House and pour cheaper and cheaper whiskey down your throat as your progressively paralyze your tastebuds.

The only private fencing club in Gainesville that I know for certain is still around is Florida Fencing Academy.  This is a great option if you want to introduce your eight year old to the sport, if you're an adult or teenager, it's not that great.  As an adult fencing there, you can expect a lack of interaction with the coaches, a lot of time with kids, and, worst of all, being asked to coach the kids.   Now, if you're affiliated with the University, or Santa Fe, your options are much better, I've fenced with people from UF before, and they were excellent fencers, and spoke highly of UF's program.  Santa Fe used to allow anyone to fence with their club, but this has changed in the last couple years, I can't speak for the current quality of their program.  Actually, I can answer more of your questions than I thought.  Avoid 34th street, Newberry road, and Archer road these roads are consistently hell.  North West of university is great, but pretty much everything worthwhile is downtown, so avoid going too far away.  There are a lot of good restaurants here, some redditers have made a list of good restaurants in the sidebar.  tl:dr- Unless you are affliated with UF, there are no good fencing clubs."

If a kayak or boat is out of question, there are places on the gulf you can shore cast - but those spots are more heavily fished and do not produce a lot of fish in my experience. I fish Yankeetown FL In my kayak just north of the Yankeetown boat ramp. I also have fished crystal river out of the very end of fort island trail. These places are about an hour drive - not to bad. You can also shore cast off either of these places but with less success.  If you want to fish fresh water - you can go to twin lakes fish camp - about 25 mins outside Gainesville. You can rent a canoe and even a pole I believe. You can catch bass and some other fish - although i just recently looked into this and haven't done it personally.  I love fishing out of my kayak on the gulf, the water is usually not too deep - u can probably get a great deal on a fishing kayak on Craigslist.

If it's your first ticket, many lawyers offer to refund your payment if they can't remove your points. 81 in a 70 isn't that bad, it will likely get completely removed from your record (no ticket, no points) and you'll just have to pay the fine and lawyer fees. Definitely better than having ticket with traffic school on your record.   Edit: When I got a ticket, I used the same reasoning of ""I don't have a reason to dispute it"". That's irrelevant. Just talk to a traffic lawyer, it should be free. They usually have very good track records for this, particularly low value speeding tickets like yours. And, you don't even have to show up to court. The lawyer acts as your proxy. Once you get everything set up, the lawyer takes care of it and informs you of the decision once it's done"

GNV,2yjwe6,bdoomed,2,Tue Mar 10 13:20:55 2015 UTC,"The points are removed, but the ticket remains on your record. The difference - insurance companies get notified when you receive points but they have to actually do a check for tickets. Usually, they won't just do random checks. But if you end up switching insurance providers, and they check, you'll end up with higher rates. It's better to get it removed.   Also, I'm definitely not an expert on this. I made the mistake of just paying it a few years ago and ended up learning a lot of this the hard way."

As part of that, I contacted Ted Yoho's office as he was ""on the fence.""  I called many times to try to get a position. I hadn't seen much in his campaign contributions; the vast majority coming from retired persons and those in his former industry (Vet).  He did receive $7k directly from ATT, but I didn't think that was anywhere close enough to being in the pocket of ATT. He does get money from many Republican based organizations, including the Koch brothers and some weird named PACs.  He's on the Agriculture committee and receives a good donation from Sugar and Beef.  He's got his own PAC, Rebuild America PAC, that's treasured by someone within his organization (her email is xxxx @ tedyoho.com).  After I called them a few times, I did receive a call from his staff who wanted to ""learn more"" about net neutrality and hear from the district.

GNV,2xczv3,carraway,3,Sat Feb 28 05:50:22 2015 UTC,"Mostly, it's because motorists don't see it as a display of rights, and instead interpret it as a bunch of ""those damned cyclists"" being a bunch of assholes.  Then you get into the logistics of how critical mass works... and that in order for it to function as planned, you have to essentially break every traffic law possible on a bicycle.  Honestly, it's not really the best way to portray cyclists.  Looking at the facebook page, it seems like OP is trying to avoid some of that by asking riders to obey traffic laws, but that really isn't enough.  When people think of Critical Mass rides, they think of mobs of unruly people on bikes... and that's a negative image.  If you want to organize something like this that doesn't portray cyclists as a bunch of dickwads, then you need to plan things ahead with the city, have a specific route planned, and have the local PD assist with traffic control.  Then you have to spin it in a positive way and try to get ""regular people"" involved.  Make it something safe and comfortable for families, not a rowdy group of bicycle 1%ers."
GNV,2xczv3,gesis,2,Sun Mar 1 20:02:19 2015 UTC,As a non-cyclist i came here to say basically the same thing.  Probably not with as much tact either.  I agree completly that these sort of events cause more harm than good.  I think a better use of time would be to teach the bicyclist the laws and how to properly ride on the road with motorist.  I have nonproblem sharing but more often then not i find my self sharing with a cyclist that has no idea how to share back.  It is really frustrating and simply causes me to support your cause less.  Education will be the thing that helps both sides to learn to share.

Second, if you're willing to give up, say, coffee every other day or movie rentals or whatever, you could probably easily budget the membership. A gym membership is an investment in YOU, so sit down and work on a budget to stick to. Mint.com can help you. Or /r/personalfinance   Third, I'm a member and I love it. I've passed the 12 month period to where the price drops. But work with the people there to see if you qualify for any discounts. When I applied, I was a UF employee, so I got a small discount.   Lastly, there's other gyms here. Not as nice as GHF, but gyms nonetheless. Shop around your budget and find what works for your wallet. Don't force yourself to struggle harder on bills just so you can go to a nicer gym."
GNV,2xa12a,risto1116,3,Fri Feb 27 15:41:15 2015 UTC,GHF will gym spoil you. Get a membership there and you will be severely disappointed when you move and can't find another gym like it. This includes big cities!
GNV,2xa12a,bebtwin,2,Fri Feb 27 12:23:40 2015 UTC,"Former GHF employee - they don't really do rate reductions. I think for the Shands employees they do payroll deduction so it comes out of pre-tax dollars, for example, but that's about it. Also read the cancellation part of the contract very carefully, gym contracts are not known for being customer friendly (I don't remember how bad theirs is off hand).   Honestly I'd say look at other gyms."
GNV,2xa12a,nothertheothergirl,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, I remember there cancellation policy very well. They came to my job and I foolishly signed up quickly, figuring it would motivate me to go to the gym. They gave us two free months I think, and I didnt go a single time in that time period, so I figured I could just cancel it.  Nope.  I think I ended up paying over $200, plus the first months cost, to leave a gym I had never stepped foot on. I now know that gym contracts are not for me.  Powerhouse is $20, month to month (at least, that's what I think. I've been going to them faithfully since I ended my contract with GHF so I've had no need to cancel). It can get a bit crowded, but I see a lot of people just ""working in"" with others if it comes to that. There's lots of machines and weights though."
GNV,2xa12a,mrimite,3,Wed Mar 4 03:50:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think they charge a fair amount IF you use every single thing they offer. Basketball/volleyball court, sauna, therapy pools, swimming pool, ""The Line,"" all of the classes, babysitting, free weights, the machines, and three locations if you're a woman. Also, they grandfather in your starting rate, so the people who got in at the ground floor love their $5/month fees. I, personally, don't know anyone who uses all of that, so I vote with my wallet and go elsewhere. There may be some partnership deals that your department/division can strike with them, where your workplace subsidizes a portion; that would be something to speak with your bosses or HR about.  Most people just need a few cardio options, a couple machines, and free weights. Between $15 and $30/mo is fair, for those things, and will get you into many of the other alternatives in town. Just remember, you do get what you pay for, so if you're going to need all the amenities and a juice bar, it's a great place."
GNV,2xa12a,HagbardCelineDion,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"My fiance also works for the state but, alas, was not able to get any sort of deal AT GHFC. They do have deals for law enforcement though, if I remember correctly.   For my membership, I pay about $50/month for the first 2 years, but then my rate goes down to like $30/month. And yes, $50 is a bit of a stretch for me, especially when you can get a decent gym membership elsewhere for less (i.e., Alter Ego, Bailey's). But it's walking distance from my house, there are a ton of classes that I go to, I use the free weights, I use the X-force machines, I do cardio, I use the boxing room, I swim, and I use the sauna. Most gyms don't offer all of those things, so I feel like my $50 is at least getting me some things I wouldn't have access to at other gyms, and that makes it worth it to me.  Before I lived within walking distance to GHFC, though, I went to Alter Ego downtown and was perfectly satisfied there. I'm pretty sure they DO have a state employees' rate...something like $20 or $25/month, but that was a year or so ago."

GNV,2x1sc0,iglooniggakeepitreal,28,Tue Feb 24 23:35:42 2015 UTC,"wine, craft beer, liquor and cigar bar... for college students?  I'll be blunt: It sounds like jack of all trades, master of none.   Do you want a downtown bar, or a college bar?  This is a broad generalization and not 100% correct, but fwiw: Majority(?) of undergrads are the midtown crowd, and those who are not go to midnight/atlantic. What do these places have in common? Why does Midtown draw such a large crowd? They're cheap. 25c pitchers, 3-4-1's, $5 all you can drink, etc.   I know plenty of undergrads who have never gone to a bar Downtown, because they think it is full of old people and/or because it costs more money. The Top bridges the two a bit, but otherwise I see mostly older people in Downtown. By older, I mean older than 19-22 yr old undergrads: grad/phd students, young professionals, and more towards middle age people. Nothing wrong with that, and I mostly count myself to this ""older"" crowd rather than the ""midtown"" crowd, but I don't think the two will ever fully mix. People want different things.   A cigar bar attracts a narrow crowd, I'd think this would require selling more expensive drinks (pricey, craft beer, and fine wine/spirits) to make up for the lower number of patrons, which further alienates much of the college crowd.  On a side note: I know this is reddit where dumb nicknames are plentiful, and this is all anonymous, but I'd be skeptical of any bar owner/manager that used the word ""nigga"" to refer to themselves. How you present yourself matters.  What I want in a bar downtown is this:    An atmosphere that allows for talking! Games (board games, cards, or more active games) are great, but only if you can socialize without having to yell and scream to make yourself heard while you play. Maybe I'm ""old"", but most places midtown are just too damn loud. Club music belongs in clubs, not bars.   Craft beer, where the beer is more than just another tap handle. That is: staff that knows (maybe even enjoys craft beer) and can tell me more about a beer than just ""I think this one is like bitter? or has lots of hops?"". I don't mind if you sell Bud and Corona, but if I ask ""What beers do you have on tap?"" and the waitress starts off with ""Bud, Bud Light, Miller, Miller Lite, Mich Ultra..."" that isn't a good sign.  Beer samplers (like those 6-pack trays of 3-4oz pours) at a reasonable price.  Decent food at a decent price! Doesn't have to be fancy, you don't need a hundred menu options, but the average bar food in GNV is mediocre at best.   Cover charges are for clubs, not bars.  Non-smoking.  Good, friendly, staff. Train them before you open. First impression matter.  Outdoor seating. Gainesville doesn't have enough of this. Rooftop seating is cool too, just throw up some optional shade, but anywhere that allows for some fresh air, sunshine, and people watching is great.  Good places to sit, and good places to set your beer if you're standing. Personally, if I'm going somewhere for a beer (and maybe some food) I don't mind picnic tables/long tables, they can foster socializing, and are less limiting than booths. If I'm going somewhere to sit down for dinner, I prefer a booth or private table.   Maybe it'll help show where I'm coming from if I say that FM is my new favorite spot in Gainesville. The only thing I really miss from there is some decent food since the quality and value of the food trucks varies.  tl;dr: Do you want to attract college students?  Edit: You might crosspost to /r/ufl"
GNV,2x1sc0,kristoferen,4,Wed Feb 25 03:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'm on board with what you're saying here.  I think that jack of all trades, master of none is the theme.  You have to pick your ""poison"" so to speak.  I also think whatever crowd you want to draw you have to be 100 % in on that crowd or else they'll stop showing up (case in point the cigar places you've mentioned here).  Good reply though!"
GNV,2x1sc0,Rwdygent,4,Wed Feb 25 04:41:07 2015 UTC,You're pretty much spot on with recent trends. I'd also add that you need to teach your bar staff cocktails and have a craft cocktail menu.
GNV,2x1sc0,dbhaley,18,Wed Feb 25 06:19:29 2015 UTC,"The one thing that I personally think our downtown lacks is someplace chill. I want to have a craft beer, but I want to sit somewhere nice with my friends to drink it. Someplace comfortable, not playing club music. The midnight used to be a good place for that, but the crowd there has changed so much. The Top is too crowded much of the time, and doesn't have a good vibe for relaxation. We have Speakeasy and the Whiskey Bar for good liquor, trivia can be found at any bar in Gainesville on a particular night, and Palamino/Main Street have billiards covered. But it is so hard to find a spot to just chill at!"

If you want to succeed with that wide menu of items, copy the bars that have bits and pieces of that formula already (The Midnight, Tall Paul's, etc).  Most important though, make sure your service is really good.  Can't have slacking bar tender/bar backs, and that whole cover thing, tread lightly on that.  Games and stuff are fun, but people go to a bar to do the main thing that a bar is for, drink and socialize.  Keep the atmosphere with the ability for people to do that and you're golden."

Look at crafty bastards for a bad example, and house of beer for a good example.  Fluid out in Tioga does cigars, and i've never seen too many people interested.

Check the Sunday Gainesville Sun for volunteer opportunities.

GNV,2wrxat,frequencyfarm,5,Thu Feb 26 00:28:02 2015 UTC,"You look pretty safe there. Paynes Prairie asks you to keep a 20' distance from gators and 100' from horses and bison. You look to be a reasonable distance away. Gators usually don't hunt during the day. Usually. There was, however, that one cool pic of a gator with a deer head in it's mouth that popped up on this sub once. thread from 2 years ago  This is a bit too close to a gator. These guys were on their way back from the observation deck when they saw the trail was blocked by this big gator. They ended up passing it one at a time. I see people do this frequently in the summer. Although the prairie doesn't recommend it, the only other option is to stand there on the trail in 90+ degree sunshine until he moves, which could take quite a while. Tough call to make.  I saw these two take a couple of steps forward and actually kneel down only a few feet away from this big guy right after I took this photo. It was by far the scariest thing I've witnessed at the prairie. While they were kneeling down, the gator flipped to the side and into the water in the blink of an eye - I mean it was fast! Kinda freaked them out. Me too for that matter. And the guy in the background. They were WAY too close.  Welcome to Gainesville, by the way!"

GNV,2wdfuh,DarthContinent,11,Thu Feb 19 00:10:16 2015 UTC,Operation Catnip  They work to humanely reduce the stray and feral community cat population in Alachua County by providing free spay/neuter and vaccinations for an stray or feral community cat.   They are trying to reduce the amount of animals entering the already overcrowded shelters by providing education about spay/neuter and mentoring for communities and the people who care for cats. Their goal is to make Alachua County a no-kill community and they're almost there.  Operation Catnip also trains veterinary students in lifesaving shelter medicine techniques with the hope that they will spread their knowledge and passion for shelter animals worldwide.  Please vote for Operation Catnip today!

GNV,2wcp7v,pandizlle,3,Thu Feb 26 05:55:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure what ""ethnic living areas"" means, but grad students (international or otherwise) are spread out.   Most places around campus are safe. Affordable is relative.   If you're just looking to meet other international students there are better ways than trying to move into the same building as a few of them. The Language Exchange at The Midnight is one suggestion, otherwise there are many clubs at UF and so on."
GNV,2wcp7v,kristoferen,2,Thu Feb 19 03:25:56 2015 UTC,Some off campus grad places include Stoneridge and Country Village. There's also the continuum but that tends to be a little bit more pricey. Most grads in my experience live in apartments south of campus

GNV,2wb7jx,ahug,6,Wed Feb 18 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Can get very packed. Yes. Yes. Yes, but no alcohol usually. Yes, but it depends on the act.  I've been to two concerts at Flavet: Reel Big Fish several years ago and Gator Growl last year.  Yes, there are bleachers, but they are usually on the sidelines and don't give a good vantage point. Not recommended.  Yes, you can sit on the grass with a blanket like a festival.   Yes, you can bring food and drinks, but probably only non-alcoholic drinks. The event info on Facebook says, ""No pets, no coolers, no backpacks,"" so it sounds like they will be searching you. I've gone through the searching thing before with a few Powerades and some snacks in my non-backpack bag, so just pack lightly.  Atmosphere is sort of OK for families; just depends on the act. For example, Ludacris most definitely did not edit the ""fucks"" out of his songs, and there were a lot of drunk kids and people smoking weed. Not sure if those things are offensive to children; I only have dogs.  I'll elaborate on my two experiences there:  The Reel Big Fish concert was pretty awesome. Everyone sat around on blankets and ate food and hung out. The weather/sunset was amazing. Some brave people even smoked some weed or brought ""brownies."" It was a really fun experience.  Gator Growl was quite different. We started out on a blanket, as did many others, but when Foster the People/Ludacris took the stage, we got trampled by all the people who suddenly decided they wanted to stand the entire time. So we had to stand too, lest we die, but we also couldn't move very much because we had this huge blanket we had to deal with. When Ludacris got to the stage, there was a lot of weed smoking, which was kind of funny, and it was very, very packed but also a lot more fun than I had expected, minus the giant comforter problem.  At both concerts, however, I saw people of (literally) every age there. Babies. Old dudes. Parents. College kids. Regular kids. Young professionals. So, don't feel like you'll be out of your element if you are parents/have children.  I'm not familiar with Edward Sharpe's music, so I'm not sure if people will go nuts and want to stand (rather than sit in the grass) after the opening acts. There will probably be stupidly drunk young kids, but they are generally nice. Considering that over 2,500 people are ""attending"" on Facebook, you may not be able to stay on your blanket for long. However, even if people ARE standing, you could still sit on your blanket but just farther back.   Hope this helps."
GNV,2wb7jx,carlidew,3,Wed Feb 18 14:32:50 2015 UTC,Hey not OP but what is the  parking situation? I'm fairly new to Gainesville still and haven't been around there or had to go anywhere near campus much. Are there garages or do I have to worry about parallel parking on some side street a million blocks away?
GNV,2wb7jx,LadyBosie,2,Wed Feb 18 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"There are lots of places you can park nearby. At that time of day, all of the decal lots are open and not monitored anymore (save for a few specially marked spots that have special signs in front of them). You can park pretty much anywhere you see a spot. Sometimes, for basketball games and maybe events like this, they even let you park in any grass areas you can find.  The Keys dormitory parking lot is just north of Flavet, but most of that will most likely be roped off because that's where they load in the performers. There is also a lot just south of Flavet, but that will probably be full because it's a small lot in a popular spot.  Good places to park near Flavet, in order of closeness:   James G. Pressly Stadium (soccer field) lot Fraternity Row lot  Law school lots O'Dome lot   Here's a link to a UF map where you can find all of the places I've listed above."

Some students skip town on the weekends and open up spots near keys, frat row, soccer track. I'd imagine you'd be alright parking on the grass on museum road like you would on a game day. Commuter lot behind Hume is probably the closest garage and large lot. O'connell isn't that far of a walk either.  As long as your early you should find a decent spot."

What strikes me about Gainesville is that it isn't a town without the university. When the students are gone, things tend to shut down. The Hipp is fairly unique, but there just isn't much I can get here that I can't get elsewhere, along with more.  Honestly, I would argue the opposite of this article. I'm not saying GNV is a bad place to be, or that the people here don't love it, but if the only place you've lived as an adult is Gainesville, it's time to explore elsewhere. You can always come back if you decide that this is the place you love most."

GNV,2w0593,kellyd1992,2,Mon Feb 16 02:53:49 2015 UTC,Why would you encourage people to use phones during a performace? The last thing I want when going to a play / movie / performance is to see everyone on their smart phones.
GNV,2w0593,sorceofnec,2,Tue Feb 17 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"Good question! We only allow the cell phones during the first Thursday ""social media"" night. The people with cell phones sit in a designated section where they will not be distracting to other customers. Many theatres in NY and elsewhere have Tweet nights as a way to get the word out about the show. However this is one night only (Thursday Feb 19) and any other night an usher will ask people to please put their phones away."

Yes, this is real! - You can choose your free tickets for MR BURNS for Wednesday at 7pm or Thursday at 8pm.  - We only live tweet the Thursday night show. If you are interested in this, please email kmcadams@thehipp.org - If you just want to see the show, and post to Reddit, FB, Twitter after the show, call the Box Office at (352) 375-4477 and use the code HIPPREDDIT to reserve a max of 2 free tickets. - We have been live-tweeting our shows for 2+ years on limited dates. We seat the tweeters in the back row so they are out of the sightline of other guests. If you want to live-tweet on a regular basis, ask to join the Hipp's Social media group on FB and you will see posts there. - Please call the box office to reserve in advance rather than just showing up as seats are limited. Post questions here."

Often, news stories rely on the opinions of random citizens within a community to determine and provide a first-person account of how the community is being affected by something. Or, in this case, the reporter is trying to get testimonials from customers who have used the service. I'm sure the reporter has already spoken with the owners of the company to get the ""facts"" for the articles. Now he is looking for voices from the community to provide a human element to the story.

GNV,2vg4ob,QuaffleNox,25,Tue Feb 10 19:21:13 2015 UTC,"You want to be on the West side.  I would disagree with instyprince about the south.  There is a lot out south but most of it is strip mall and students.  I go over there as little as possible.  Also, a lot of the neighborhoods further out that way are new construction that is more pricey, has less character, and variable quality.  The North west quadrant has the best schools, the best parks, and the best opportunities for things like riding bikes to get around.    Also, as a new mother, there are a lot of things happening on this side of town for moms and babes.  There is a hospital on this side of town, North Florida Regional Medical Center that has a women's center.  That's where 80% of the OBs and pediatricians are.  They have a great pond with ducks that most kids love to go feed and most of the pediatricians have duck food available for after your appointment.  They do big business in obstetrics and as part of that, they have a mothers luncheon every Tuesday for the new mothers.  Your little one will be a little old for the group but if you contact the nurse who runs them, she'll get you into the facebook group with other moms of kids your baby's age.  My cohort does TONS of things together and has been a real blessing.    Check out Fun4GatorKids to see how much stuff there is going on all the time.  Many of the libraries have infant lap time, toddler story time, family game days, etc. as well.    Gainesville is very humid and when looking at houses, if you're going to buy, I recommend concrete block construction.  They can be less attractive on the outside if nothing has been done as a facade, but they hold up amazingly in this wet, hot environment and have a lot less mold problems than wooden frame.  You should be able to get a decent starter home for around $150K.  Avoid anything on Archer road like the plague.  Tioga and Haile are nice areas but they have much higher costs than say the 32606 zip code and surrounding areas.  They will have fancier finishes though if that's important to you.  I'd like granite counters but I'd rather pay off my house in 15 years and then buy some.    Best things: amazing restaurants, parks, nearby water activities, close to lots of major airports, one of our own that's not bad, tons of cultural activities with 2 colleges and several non-college theaters, Gator sports, 2 local breweries with awesome beer and tasting rooms...  Worst things: Graduation weekends, Archer Road and Butler Plaza (huge shopping area), traffic gets crazy for a few weeks when all the students arrive, (oh, but a best thing is all the cheap and free stuff they get rid of when they move in the Spring!), um...  Schools are good if you stay in the in the NW and some SW areas.  I teach at one of the high schools.  There are accelerated magnets at the middle and high school levels.    If you do end up moving here, pm me and I'd be happy to give you the number of the nurse that leads the luncheons and help you get hooked up with moms in your cohort."

I grew up in Brooklyn, NY and have had the luxury of traveling to most big cities on the east and west coast. Now not all the restaurants in Gainesville are great, but we do have a fine selection with tons of diversity. You just need to stay away from Archer road. Avoid that area like the plague, unless you enjoy chain restaurants."

GNV,2vg4ob,DBuckFactory,4,Wed Feb 11 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"I loved my time in Gainesville.  I mostly left because my wife wanted to be near family and all of our friends moved away.  Anyhow, my wife is a teacher and she taught in GNV for 4 years at a few different schools.  One cool thing about Gainesville is that a lot of the teachers are all young and usually smart.  Many went through the degree program at the University, which is pretty good from what I saw.  There are good teachers and bad teachers, still, though.  I think the biggest thing is to find a good teacher wherever you are.  If you're in a ""good area"" for a good school, you'll be fine.  I can't remember all the names of the schools, but, if you have questions, I can ask my wife what she thinks of them as she knows it pretty well.   I have lived in college towns before and felt that the school tends to over shadow the town. Is Gainesville mainly a college oriented town or are there more ""family friendly"" aspects as well?   The town is HEAVILY influenced and supported by the University, but there are a lot of family friendly aspects as well.  Gainesville has been voted one of the best college towns to stay in after graduating for multiple years.    One of my favorite things about Gainesville is the good food options.  It may not be as good as your current area, but it is leagues better than where I am now (South Florida).    Also, if you're into sports, there are a lot of free/cheap options to go see them.  The softball team is amazing to watch and it's a super fun thing to do with kids.  Gymnastics meets are also extremely fun to watch.  Both of those teams are in the top of the nation.  Seeing the best in the nation compete for free is a real treat!  If your husband is affiliated with the University, it's 100% free to go to gymnastics.  If not, it's still very cheap to go."
GNV,2vg4ob,PeeingInLove,5,Tue Feb 10 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"The further northwest you go, the more family oriented it gets.  There are multiple neighborhoods for families the further you get from campus.  It's a solid town with a lot of community offerings.  I'm in my 20-s, and I've been here for 8-years, in and out of school, so I've been party to both campus, townie, and family goings on.  The schools are solid, there's tons of naturey stuff.  Also, you guys are on the younger side, and there's TONS of stuff for mid-to-late 20-year old young-professional types.  However, make sure your three month old stays out of the punk scene.  If he comes home from a show wearing a black denim jacket with a Discharge patch on the back, you should have a family meeting."
GNV,2vg4ob,wealthy_white_jesus,5,Tue Feb 10 21:20:14 2015 UTC,"My wife is a resident at Shands - we have been here 3 years. I love it - housing is reasonably priced - college town feel, so decent restaurants and culture. I live in a neighborhood in south west Gainesville that is new construction. The neighborhood is absolutely full of residents in first time homes.  Some neighborhoods to look at would be willow oak or long leaf - new construction housing of all sizes.   There is also no state income tax in Florida which is nice. Summers there are festivals and free concerts in the park. You are only 2 hours from some great beaches and cities: Jacksonville, Tampa-St.Pete, Orlando, St. Augustine."
GNV,2vg4ob,river49,5,Tue Feb 10 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"As somebody who grew up here my entire life, and chose to stay in town and go to UF, I would definitely say Gainesville is a great city to live (and grow up) in.   Housing can fluctuate quite a bit. Haile Plantation is honestly overpriced but there are no negatives to living there. There are some good deals on apartments out by 39th and 43rd. Pineview Terraces is great and pretty cheap for a 2br/2b. Growing up in Gainesville is awesome. There are good public schools, but having the university in town is great for kids and really boosts local education. It's also 2 hours from Jacksonville, Tampa, and Orlando/Disney, which is really nice There isn't much I hate, but for non-students I know we can be a hassle sometimes. Saturday is football day whether you like it or not. I took a very odd path in school, as I went to P.K. Yonge (UF's developmental research school) for K-5. I would 1000% try and get your kid into P.K. (which is easier said then done). It's technically private but if I remember correctly the tuition was like $200 a year (so really a technicality). I did the magnet program at Howard Bishop (stay away, Lincoln too) in middle school and then went to Buchholz for High School, which is by far the best of the 3 high schools and is in the best part of town. As far as public middle schools I would say Ft. Clarke is the best, with Kanapaha behind it because there are some sketchy neighborhoods near the school. Seriously though, try to get your kid into P.K. Gainesville is definitely a college town but when you get out towards the westward expansion (Haile, Tioga, The Quarries) you can barely tell. West Gainesville is very family-friendly. Once you get towards 34th and head towards Main St you get into the University/Downtown/Off-campus student housing, and that part of town is definitely tailored towards 20 somethings, but there is still stuff down there to do (like the rock gym).   Just PM me if you have any other questions, i'd be happy to help."
GNV,2vg4ob,commiecat,3,Tue Feb 10 21:48:22 2015 UTC,"Awesome advice given already.  I have a 15 mo. old daughter myself.   How is the housing available? (We have been looking at houses online but are completely clueless to which areas are more ""family friendly"" as opposed to college oriented.   We moved from NE to NW Gainesville shortly after our daughter was born.  NE Gainesville includes the historic Duck Pond neighborhood: the homes are quaint but old and generally on the smaller side.  We loved the area as it's close to downtown but we wanted to go somewhere more family-friendly in good school zones.  Which is why we moved to NW Gainesville where the homes are newer and larger and zoned for the schools we preferred.   What are some of the best/worst things about Gainesville?   I'm in my late 30s and have been here since '97.  I'll start with the worst being 'back to school' time when places will get more crowded for a week or two and students come back, and even as a lifelong Floridian the summers still get pretty brutal with the humidity.    I love this area.  Outside of July and August the weather is generally enjoyable.  This area of Florida is surrounded by farmland which gives us ample supply of local foods.  There is a wide variety of bars, restaurants, and shops downtown.  The university and colleges always have things going on even aside from the major sporting events.  It's central to many other awesome cities: 3 hours or less to Orlando, Tampa, Jax, Savannah, or St. Augustine.  Add a bit more and you can get to Atlanta or Miami.  There are plenty of parks and trails in Gainesville or nearby.   What are the school districts like?   I'm really don't know as much about this as I should.  When we were looking for a new house my wife handled the school zoning bits.     I have lived in college towns before and felt that the school tends to over shadow the town. Is Gainesville mainly a college oriented town or are there more ""family friendly"" aspects as well?   It's a bit of both.  The university plays a massive role but there are definitely family friendly aspects: city parks, history and art museum at UF, zoo at Santa Fe.  A lot of the restaurants we visit are good for a little one and there's a fairly new brewery called First Magnitude that has a nice outdoor area with games; every time we've been with our daughter there have been kids out there playing.  I'm happy here and the university ensures there are always various events going on around town.  It's not a metropolis but I think we have our fair share of activities and local establishments, and as I said earlier we're not that far from several major cities.  You can take Delta from our little airport to their hub in Atlanta (~45 mins) and from there go pretty much anywhere, and the best part of that is TSA here isn't nearly as bad as in an int'l airport.  Best of luck to you in whatever you decide.  If you wind up in Gainesville come back and let us know!"

GNV,2vg4ob,carlidew,2,Thu Feb 12 14:44:34 2015 UTC,Stick to SW/NW gainesville. Southwest tends to be a little more ideal since the town has moved in that direction. Look in the area of Haile Plantation or Town of Tioga in the SW. That's where the more middle to upper middle class neighborhoods are and the higher ranking schools. Best thing? Very unlike the rest of the South or Florida. Worst thing? Butler plaza and traffic. There is a heavy UF presence (be prepared to be blinded by Orange and Blue) but there is plenty of culture and life outside of UF.

GNV,2vg4ob,carlidew,11,Wed Feb 18 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I have to disagree with this person. If you're looking to avoid traffic, living in Haile or Tioga will not help you. Both are west of I-75, and anything west of the highway is going to add a lot of time to your commute because of the traffic involved. (There are only two main arteries that head that direction and they are very, very congested during rush hours.) Plus, they're in the process of building a new, HUGE development on Archer Road (one of only two options to get home if you live in Haile), which will add a ton of congestion and extra stop lights to that already miserable commute.   The pro to these neighborhoods, though, is that you would be on Clay Electric (not GRU) for your utilities, which tends to be cheaper than GRU. The houses are newer (but not always more efficient than older homes) and can be cookie-cutter, but they lack the charm that you'll find in many of the older homes in Gainesville (but that appeals to some people...) and the lot sizes are small.   I live just east of the highway off of Newberry Road. (Near Gainesville Health and Fitness if you want to Google it.) This is a great area with great schools. It is family friendly and safe. You can find some really nice houses here with large backyards, and the commute to downtown and UF is easy. There is a library close by as well as lots of parks, restaurants, grocery stores, etc. Also, because these are older neighborhoods, there is a lot of tree cover here, unlike the newer neighborhoods west of the highway, which tend to cut down all the trees before they build. And, of course, no HOA fees in these older neighborhoods. (I would define this area as anything east of I-75, north of Newberry Road, south of NW 39th, and west of 34th St.)  Duck Pond is a favorite neighborhood of people here because it is in the historic district, where you can walk to downtown, and there is lots of charm. A lot of family-friendly things take place downtown, like the annual art show, free Fridays outdoor concerts in the summer, Active Streets (where they shut down University Ave for people to play in the street), etc. Houses tend to be more expensive because it is such a coveted area, but there are lots of options just outside the Duck Pond that offer the same proximity to downtown. Schools in this area are OK, and you may get the occasional bum scavenging your recyclables for cans or someone testing your car doors (always lock them), but generally it is very safe and quite beautiful. I would love to live there someday.  If you want to avoid the university/college kids, stay away from most housing south of Archer Road and anything on SW 20th St. Also, the area north of University, south of 8th Ave, east of 34th St, and west of 13th St tends to be student-heavy, but there are lots of houses north of 8th Ave that are more family oriented.  When I was a student, I thought Gainesville was just about UF. But, having lived here for 10 years now, it is so much more than that. I love living here; it has the culture of a larger city and the charm/size of a smaller city. It's safe, cheap, and fun; I would not hesitate to raise a family here. Plus, Gainesville is perfectly situated in Florida: Tampa, Orlando, Tallahassee, Jacksonville, and Daytona Beach are all under 2 hours away. There is no other city I'd want to live in here.  There is also a large network of young professionals here via ACEL (Alachua County Emerging Leaders). You may want to check them out once you're settled. It's a great way to meet new people and get involved in the community."

If you're looking to do cardio or circuit training with machines, it's not bad.  There's not really any good gym in Gainesville for a good price.  Powerhouse is expensive ($260/yr compared to $121/yr @PF) and they make it a HUGE pain in the ass to cancel your membership.  Bailey's might be a good option if you want to do powerlifting, but it was a bit dirty when I checked it out multiple years ago."

I know the apartment next to us is currently empty and you won't have to worry about upstairs or downstairs neighbors.  It's real quiet except traffic during the day due to being next to Santa Fe College. It's about a 1 minute drive to I-75 if you don't hit any red lights and its the the northernmost Gainesville exit (390) so you'll be close to Alachua.  The whole complex itself doesn't look that great but we are in a detached area of nice looking townhomes full of students and young families.   Our unit did not come with a washer and dryer but we stopped looking to buy some after we realized using the laundry room here is actually really fast and expensive with industrial dryers. We can get 5 loads done in about 90 minutes.  We have cox but when I was shopping for services I believe there were quite a few other options available.  Feel free to ask any questions about it.

GNV,2vazz2,FL_Sportsman,3,Mon Feb 9 15:13:54 2015 UTC,"If there is one thing Best Buy is good for, its getting to hold and play with cameras in your hand. I recommend going in and just feeling which camera types and bodies feel right to you.   Don't let the salesmen try to talk you in to anything, in fact don't even let them talk. I sometimes like to feign ignorance about an item just to see what they can tell me about it and the results are often cringe-worthy.  Personally, I like the weight and options of a nice DSLR. After getting my feet wet a few years ago with a Canon T2i, I fell in love with the feel and versatility of a DSLR over more compact mirrorless. But everyone has their own opinions on what feels right to them. I now own 4 pro and semi-pro level DSLRs and I won't be going back to compact or mirrorless anytime soon.  Here's a great site to find the right camera for you. Use the filters at the top to sort:  http://snapsort.com/recommend#!general=price&image-quality=best-overall-quality&price=500"
GNV,2vazz2,risto1116,1 point,Mon Feb 9 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"Good advice! When I was in BB they had the a5100 and a6000 on display, along with a bunch of larger DSLRs.   There is something to the weight and feel of a full DSLR for sure. It can be easier to hold the larger T2i-type cameras steady, and larger lenses on the small mirrorless cameras can be a tad awkward, but it is something you get used to.   To me, there is great value of being able to stick an APS-C sensor mirrorless camera w/ kit 16-50 or prime lens in my pocket. The low weight of it also lets you buy less expensive, lighter weight, tripods... :)"
GNV,2vazz2,kristoferen,2,Mon Feb 9 16:05:40 2015 UTC,"Since i'm no pro i really prefer the smaller form factor and lighter weight. I've already decided to go mirrorless and i'm just weighing my options. I hunt, fish, go to car shows, races you name it. Im all over the place. I think a full frame dslr would just be overkill for my ameturish need but point and shoots just aren't good enough."
GNV,2vazz2,foxtalep,2,Mon Feb 9 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it would be a good match then. If you're not needing an optical viewfinder or access to longer sharper lenses, this could fit your needs. I personally like the in-camera jpg processing in the Olympus cameras (Pen series) and Fuji for low-light (pricey). I like the feel of the newer NEX cameras and how the dials are laid out but I'm not super familiar with their lenses. Make sure to look at bhphoto.com and keh.com for deals (I think BB said they will match prices nowadays, but these online stores may have better deals going on or good used equipment)."

Id rather not go back a year to save $50 then find out the $50 would have bought me some better features. I'm not sure if i need teh optical view finder or not. From my Quadcopter i will be using autofocus. As long as there is a video out i can view the image from the ground to line up shots and use a remote shutter off of my receiver.

GNV,2vazz2,cercidasthecynic,2,Mon Feb 9 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"Very true. I like my lens options, my weather proof body, and the fact that they take a beating without skipping a beat!

GNV,2vazz2,kristoferen,1 point,Tue Feb 10 07:52:55 2015 UTC,Yea. I started out in r photography. Sometimes I like to ask local people the same question.
GNV,2vazz2,jtrez,1 point,Tue Feb 10 13:45:09 2015 UTC,"You might also consider the a5100 (no EVF) and a6000 (decent but not great EVF). BestBuy has ""Open Box"" versions of both on occasion for much cheaper. I got the a5100 w/ lens open box and it was brand new with the seals on everything - someone likely bought it and returned it without ever opening it, either way I couldn't be happier for the money I paid.  I'm fairly new to DSLR photography so take this fwiw, but I have the a5100 and love it. Previously I used the Canon T3i, and while it was slightly easier access to certain settings, the smaller size and weight of the Sony, plus some additional features more than makes up for that!  The lack of an EVF isn't optimal I got the a5100 for so cheap I couldn't say no. Note that this camera is APS-C (same as most DSLR like Canon T#i series) so they have a bit of a crop factor (eg. 22mm on APS-C is equivalent to 35mm on full-frame).  The kit lens (16-50 f/3.5-5.6 OSS) is decent, as is the tele kit (55-210 f/4.5-6.3 OSS at ~$250).  Sigma makes very nice ~$200 prime lenses at 18, 30, and 50mm at f/2.8, and Sony's own f.1/8 runs you $250-$450 depending on mm. Rokinon and Samyang make fish-eye lenses for $250-350.   E-mount lenses seem a bit more expensive, and harder to find used (except for kit), but if you're serious and you're going to have a bunch of lenses theres always the A-mount adapter (note: I heard there are two adapter versions and one has issues, altho I've never used either).  If you have any specific questions I'll be happy to try to answer them, but like I said my experience is with the alpha, not the nex.  Edit to add: The a5100 can do 1080p @ 60fps video using the XAVC S codec running at 50mbit, which is nice. The a6000 does 1080p @ 60fps, but using the AVCHD codec at 28mb."
GNV,2vazz2,jtrez,2,Mon Feb 9 15:49:56 2015 UTC,The Alpha 6000 was another camera i was looking at. I may need to just go to Best Buy and hold them. I'm just looking for a nice shooting camera in a smallish form factor and the  lighter the better. One of its uses will be dangling underneath one of my quadcopters on a gimbal for aerial photos later down the road. Thats the reason i'm looking into a mirrorless. I need to keep my camera and gimbal weight as close to or below 1kg as possible or i'm going to have to double up my motors and go from 4 to 8 to support the added weight.

In case you missed my edit, and if you're doing quadcopter w/ gimbal I'm guessing you might be doing video as well:  The a5100 can do 1080p @ 60fps video using the XAVC S codec running at 50mbit, which is nice. The a6000 does 1080p @ 60fps, but using the AVCHD codec at 28mb."

GNV,2v4crb,dmft91,2,Sun Feb 8 02:13:01 2015 UTC,"Lived in LA for about 9 years. Cox is about 1/2 the price of TWC in LA and about 5x as fast. This is citywide. Not just a pocket. Cox also doesn't throttle data like Comcast and TWC. it also doesn't flag you for how you use data (to my knowledge) like Comcast or TWC, and even Charter in Tx which is also more expensive and not as fast). You may not have everything you want, but cox is waaaaaaaay better than anyone I've ever dealt with. 150/down 100/up for $150/mo?  Can't get those speeds without 4x that cost in LA or NY."

I never asked for a free burrito, why would they ask me for money?   OK? Except it isn't really a question of who is to ""blame"" since we aren't looking for a culprit for anything here.

I even blow the doors off that 400gb a month, and cox sends me a courtesy message each month I go over, but does nothing to affect my speed, or bandwidth. The local competitors are AT&T and GRU with its GRUCom service, which is fiber to the home. I do realize that one is DSL and the other is only offered in select communities, but there is competition. Also COX isn't pulling the crap that comcast is with limiting bandwidth to certain popular services that don't pay them higher premiums, look up netflix & comcast to understand. Also COX is in favor of net neutrality whereas most other cable internet providers are not. Please call cox and get a better understanding of what exactly you're getting. Oh and by the way, the increase in bill wasn't COX raising your rates, it was your local and state government raising the taxes on communications services.

Cox can work with you to ensure that these issues are identified and corrected. In other cases, customers may choose to reduce their usage or switch to another Internet package that provides more data.

Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of calcium and magnesium-containing minerals such as limestone, chalk and dolomite.  Hard drinking water is generally not harmful to one's health,  but can pose serious problems in industrial settings, where water hardness is monitored to avoid costly breakdowns in boilers, cooling towers, and other equipment that handles water. In domestic settings, hard water is often indicated by a lack of suds formation when soap is agitated in water, and by the formation of limescale in kettles and water heaters. Wherever water hardness is a concern, water softening is commonly used to reduce hard water's adverse effects.

GNV,2ut4bq,inquire_the_truth,6,Thu Feb 5 00:35:59 2015 UTC,"I used to work Search and a Rescue right outside Memphis, TN. It's very possible to get stuck in the muck of the swamp even if you're sober. Went on one rescue where we were able to get a Jon boat about 50 feet away from the people we were rescuing. As soon as we jumped out of the boat, we sank up to our waists and couldn't move. We were able to pull ourselves back up and out with the boat. We tackled the rescue a little differently after that scare."

Now that Swamp Head has joined First Magnitude in not allowing pups, there's no place in Gainesville for people who like both beer and dogs to enjoy both at the same time. Bummer.  Edit: I know that most bars allow dogs outdoors, and I realize how overly dramatic the above statement sounds. But at least in the context of breweries in Gainesville, it's still true. Sorry, I should have been more clear in my whining."

I have no affiliation with them, but I live near there and really enjoy it. They also just finished Crafty Bastards in the same area which boasts something like 50-60 taps (but not dog friendly!)"

GNV,2uroew,YeshilPasha,2,Wed Feb 4 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"Food yes, but they don't serve food. I don't know the law though, and many bars are rather lax about it. I totally understand about not letting them in the bars (although I've been to a few in town who do allow it), but I don't understand not allowing them outside either - as in First Magnitude's stance."
GNV,2uroew,pj2d2,2,Wed Feb 4 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"I asked one of the people who works there, don't remember who. They plan to allow dogs outside eventually, but the outdoor space is on hold for now and they can't say when it will be open. Inside has been ruled out. It's just disappointing after them being totally fine with dogs at the old location. And my pup is especially bummed, as she's one of the biggest Stumpknocker fans I know."

The front office (at the time) was super helpful, and the wooded vibe was always pleasant. The location seems better than it really is, Old Archer is a pain in the ass to navigate at times, and you're just far enough from campus where you dont want to drive, but not close enough really top walk.

GNV,2ufu5k,furryoso,3,Mon Feb 2 01:27:25 2015 UTC,"Ok. I hate this question.  Let me say this... I'm a great amateur photographer. Been shooting for about 20 years and love it. Things have changed a lot in 20 years... we were really cost conscious before digital, but that's another story.  I say amateur because I'm so sick of all of these new photographers I see in the area shooting weddings, etc. and are now ""photographers"" because they have lightroom, photoshop, and an SLR. Not saying this is you... just venting.  Why I hate your question (but ironically upvoted it)  What you shoot isn't as important as making a fun/interesting shot. Shooting people is way different than shooting landscapes or stills. Shooting actions, reactions, and change is different than shooting century tower, the stadium, or an alligator on la chua trail.  A good photographer can make almost anything special. It's not about seeing something unique, it's about uniquely seeing things.  Ansel Adams had great shots of amazing areas few had ever been. What made his shots special was his photography; his eye. He took amazing photographs of people, landscapes, and more-- each showcasing his eye.  If you're just starting... start learning about light. Grab your phone and take photos of it in front of a window, then with light from the window, then with no window, and so on and so on until you can see what settings you need to change and make that phone look good (and interesting) each time.  Play with composition. Don't make the focal point center, then move it. Play with a tic tac toe board theory... make your own versions too... (Personally I like triangular, but opinions are irrelevant... shoot what makes you happy).  Walk outside and pick something-- a mailbox, tree, street sign... anything. Take a shot in the morning, at noon, and 3, at 6, at night... see how the light chages.  Learn light  Then, when you've learned how to place things into your photo, how to frame a photo, how to light a photo, how to work with changing light, what those f stops and exposure settings do... then you're ready to find fun things to shoot.  edit: so many typos."

GNV,2ufntr,cr8in,5,Sun Feb 1 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"This area has nicer apartments and the safer/nicer neighborhoods in town.  Magnolia Parke has a grassy area with a few restaurants (One Love Cafe, Taste, Harvest Thyme, Dominos), Starbucks, and a nice little liquor store.  Just across 39th there are a few more restaurants (good BBQ), a doughnut shop, etc.  It would be a longer walk to Publix, which has Ace Hardware, Subway, a Chinese restaurant, and a few other shops in the same spot.  Across from there are more restaurants, Walgreens, and a frozen yogurt place.  Just past that is the big park with the skate park, walking trails, etc.  A similar distance to the south puts you at another Publix, Fresh Market, CVS, Cairo Grille, Zaxby's, 43rd St. Deli, Flying Biscuit, a liquor store with great selection, Upper Crust Bakery, Five Guys, a bird watching/feeding store with nice people to talk to, etc.  Just north of Fresh Market (closer to this area) is Thornebrooke Village shopping center, which is small, but has a few nice shops that older people like (jewelry, clothing, art, beads, furniture, chocolate/gifts, thrift/antiques, etc.), as well as TCBY, Chopstix, Fromaggio's, and a bar.  It's across from a retirement community, so there are older folks around, and they occasionally have art festivals there.  If that ends up being too far to walk, there are a few buses that go right between there and Magnolia Parke (#43).  The looping neighborhoods northwest of Magnolia Parke (NW 53rd st.) are great for walks, with quite a few older residents who walk most evenings, lots of squirrels and friendly cats, and ponds that are always full of turtles, muscovy ducks, white ibis, egrets, great blue herons, black herons, anhingas, and occasional vultures, falcons, and kestrels.  You will also see deer wandering through front yards.  This area is far from campus and partying students."

GNV,2u2sd4,lesliev2001,3,Thu Jan 29 13:12:01 2015 UTC,"I live in harbor cove. The apartments are really nice but the walls are paper thin and maintenance can be dicks. They'll take forever to do something or never do it at all. They broke the chain in my apartment once because we were asleep and didn't hear the door. The guys are harmless but it was still a dick move.   Lots of families, tons of kids, small playgrounds, quiet and safe neighborhood, gated, police keep a presence for prevention, and it's 5 minutes from the mall so there's plenty to do if you're not broke.   They allow one pet per household and the pet fee is rather outrageous but refundable. It was $400 pet deposit and an additional $50/month for pet rent."
GNV,2u2sd4,CaususLuciferi,3,Thu Jan 29 18:03:00 2015 UTC,"I stayed there for a while as is was the nicest place I could afford. All the above is true, but I will add that when I lived there, there was a problem with people climbing over the fence in the back for whatever illegal activities were the flavor of the month. I had friends visit and find used needles in the parking lot (maybe a sloppy diabetic?) more than once. The gate was also rendered inoperable at least twice when someone rammed it."
GNV,2u2sd4,reddjoey,2,Thu Jan 29 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yuck. I haven't noticed anyone climbing over fences, but then again I don't go out much either. I don't think diabetics would leave needles laying around (I'm diabetic myself, and before I used pens when I still used the vial and syringes, I'd always clip the needle off after using it and put it in a container in my house and every few months drop the container off at the hospital to dispose of them properly), but there's always that guy so it's not entirely impossible.  The gate is still like that, where it will be open for days on end sometimes with no explanation. I hadn't considered it being people ramming it, but it'd make sense. People rush through that shit all the time, and tailgate others to make it in before it closes. When I first moved in it was open for a month straight and I had no idea how to even use my key card until after I lived there for like two months.  Also that reminded me, I want to add that the front office is constantly changing or removing the pass code for the gate without telling anyone what the new code is or that they even removed it, so make sure you (OP) always have your key card if you move in, or set your cell phone up to let you in if your cells area code is 352."

GNV,2u2sd4,ciacciojon,3,Thu Jan 29 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"Harbor Cove and Reflections are both near some ""less than desirable"" areas of the county. That being said, when I lived in Reflections 15 years ago, it was great. I'd not live there again today. When I was there, it was vast majority students. Now it's a general combination.  Santa Fe Oaks has a decently active night-time activity on the courts... lots of people and haven't seen too many problems (I live in that area). The house wasn't too far from Santa Fe Oaks, which is why I suggested.  I'd recommend driving to each of these during the day, evening, and at night (both weekday and weekend) to get a feel for it."

GNV,2u2sd4,ciacciojon,2,Thu Jan 29 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't consider Reflections to be in those areas. I used to live in Cricket Club, just over the fence everyone hops. I wouldn't recommend Reflections based on the activity that goes on there, but Tower Road is a pretty nice neighborhood.  Just down the street from both is The Gardens. Last time I checked, a 2 B/2.5 BA was like $749 and the 4 bedroom is around $1000. I definitely recommend this place. It's a nice mix of students, older folks, and families. No loud parties on the weekend. Bruce, the maintenance supervisor, is great & so are the other maintenance guys.  Generally, I would say stay away from student-heavy areas. The farther you can get from campus, the better chances you'll have at a nice place without such a high price tag. Also, I'd maybe avoid some of the SE areas. (I live over that way. I don't think it's that bad, but even without a ton of crime, there are loud domestic disputes, etc.)"

GNV,2tx9xb,MgARBITER,3,Wed Jan 28 03:40:18 2015 UTC,Ting uses the Sprint network so you can look at their coverage map for details. There are a couple of spots in and around Gvl that have gaps in coverage but it has not been that noticeable for us. My family has been using Ting for 6 mos now and we love it! You could do what I did and start a line with Ting and use it for a month- no contract so you can cancel if it doesnt work for you. Good luck!
GNV,2tx9xb,gingersnaptatertot,3,Wed Jan 28 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"I live near downtown and I go to Santa Fe. Never had a problem with coverage at school or at home.  I absolutely love ting. I try to use wifi when I can and my phone bill is less than $30 a month. Also if you do decide to use ting, make sure to use someone's referral link, I think they give you something like $100 credit, which should be several months of free phone service. Def check out /r/ting"

I have bought 4 used iphones from ReTech, which we like.  I'd be willing to pass on my old android phone to you if you want it."
GNV,2tx9xb,LetterM,1 point,Wed Jan 28 04:35:39 2015 UTC,"Ting uses either the sprint or t-mobile network(starting in February). I've only had ting for a few months, and have only recently moved to Gainesville, but I've never had an issue with service. If you're worried about using too much data, you can set an alert that either warns you that you are approaching your preset limit, or you can even block it completely until the next billing period. This is my referral link https://zf5mc13glm7.ting.com/ It gives you a 25$ credit which should cover your first bill."
GNV,2tx9xb,qhp,3,Wed Jan 28 05:14:17 2015 UTC,"As others in here have said, Ting runs on the Sprint network. Sprint's coverage in Gainesville is kind of spotty. Verizon and AT&T easily have the best coverage, and then T-Mobile Sprint have the worst, from my experience. Things may have changed from when I did my research/experiments, but at the time they were not in the favor of Sprint.  Ting, however, is a phenomenal company. If Sprint has stepped up their GNV game, I will probably get Ting once my contract is up."
GNV,2tx9xb,LadyBosie,2,Wed Jan 28 09:07:16 2015 UTC,I don't know about Ting but whatever you do stay away from T-Mobile. It was fine in Orlando but when I moved her it was awful. Constant dropped calls and lots of areas where I would get no reception at all.  I just switched to AT&T which is a lot better.
GNV,2tx9xb,robmillerfl,2,Wed Jan 28 14:50:26 2015 UTC,OP: Be sure to use code word 'Rogan' to save $25 on your Ting sign up.
GNV,2tx9xb,Cannabisitis,2,Wed Jan 28 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about coverage, stay away from anything using Sprint's towers if you're in Gainesville. In order of coverage best to worst, it's Verizon > AT&T > T-Mobile > Sprint. Coverage is also directly related to your mobile data speeds, so you'll get slow internet speeds with Ting. You're going to be happier with a Verizon MVNO like Page Plus or an AT&T MVNO like Net10 or H2O.   Another thing to keep in mind, Sprint phones are worth less and drop in value quickly due to the fact that they're locked to Sprints network. GSM phones and phones that have GSM bands (like Verizon LTE phones) can be used anywhere in the world. They're very easy to sell once you want to upgrade.   I'd strongly suggest Page Plus over Ting.   Edit: grammar"

GNV,2tryso,e2mtt,2,Tue Jan 27 01:05:16 2015 UTC,I could easily argue that Cymply Fresh Cafe is no where near the best lunch in Gainesville.  Hogan's is so far above Dave's... no way is Dave's the best sandwich in town.
GNV,2tryso,furryoso,1 point,Tue Jan 27 21:36:37 2015 UTC,"It's a difficult argument you make. I've considered Hogans to be the best sub sandwiches anywhere, ever since I first ate there 10 years ago.   However Dave's makes a hot pastrami on rye that is perfect."

GNV,2tryso,furryoso,3,Tue Jan 27 19:45:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm vegetarian so I had no idea that the burgers at Loosey's werent that good.

Haven't made it out to Cilantro Tacos yet."
GNV,2tryso,e2mtt,1 point,Tue Jan 27 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"I enjoy Ken's recommendations and comments because I found his taste line up quite well with mine. Most of the items that he has bragged about, I've loved (many of them before I read his review) and the restaurants he was disappointed in, often I had similar thoughts.  I go to Loosey's over near Haille when they're open for lunch (Friday only). I've always found the burgers to be excellent and it's a bit of a Friday treat when I'm in the area. (They aren't my favorite burger in the area though, because I prefer thinner patties cooked on a griddle the way you get it at Mac's drive-through, Five Guys, Burgerfi, Relish…)  With Gainesville being a relatively small city, I would expect most of the foodies to end up becoming friends with each other, Ken included. Thus I think that faulting a local area reviewer for being friends with a restauranteur is rather disingenuous."

GNV,2tryso,C-dubbb,5,Tue Jan 27 22:07:52 2015 UTC,"The good: Ameraucana is twice the pizza restaurant the Satchel's wishes it was with their corny bumper stickers, and they do it out of a truck.  The bad: Hard to agree with Loosey's over The Top for best burger, the Mastadon is pretty outrageous.  The ugly: Hogan's all day.  Their meatball sub shouldn't even be considered food moreso than art.  As for best wings, check out Napalatano's (yes, you read that right.)  It's on their appetizer menu, and they are a mile better than anywhere else in town."
GNV,2tryso,Vettit,3,Fri Jan 30 10:46:13 2015 UTC,Satchel's is still amazing when Satchel is there to keep the kitchen together. Big Lou's is extremely under-rated and probably the most consistently well made pie in town.
GNV,2tryso,Ohhhhhk,5,Tue Jan 27 01:06:31 2015 UTC,"I've only been to Big Lou's twice. Once while very drunk and I got a pepperoni slice that was amazing. Other time, went in and split a full pizza and it was very meh. I don't know if it was that I was drunk the first time, or if it was just inconsistent   Gainesville pizza just really isn't all that good though. Millhopper Leonardo is probably my favorite, but still doesn't compare to Carmello's in St. Augustine or Giordano's in Orlando."
GNV,2tryso,e2mtt,2,Tue Jan 27 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"I have to completely disagree. Big Lou's to me is the most INconsistent. Sometimes it is great, and sometimes it is incredibly blah. I think in general Gainesville needs to step up it's pizza game."
GNV,2tryso,Ohhhhhk,1 point,Tue Jan 27 21:01:37 2015 UTC,Disagree about Big Lou's... very much agree about stepping up pizza game.  My favorite was 2nd Generation mama mia's on Main / N 23rd. Great pizza but no traffic to keep them open.  I like Satchel's IF you go on an off night... it's not worth the crowd. I've waited less time for Grimaldi's in brooklyn.  Pizza2Go in High Springs surprised me as very good... of course it's very rare that i'm in High Springs.
GNV,2tryso,Lilusa,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:06:41 2015 UTC,I thought Southern Charm was also a good choice. And I genuinely miss Hogan's and Mac's. Didn't realize how spoiled I was working right down the road from both.
GNV,2tryso,kpeng,2,Tue Jan 27 22:49:27 2015 UTC,"I have always enjoyed his recommendations. Even if I don't agree that they are the ""BEST"" in town, they are HIS favorites... which is what he says, and often times align with what I enjoy as well, and may not have tried otherwise.  For example... El Indio is king IMO. But I am glad I went out to try Cilantro's and would not have had he not suggested it. I would recommend Cilantros to others. I enjoyed Crane as well. And I liked Blaze, even though he didn't give a stellar review of it.   It's not like he is proclaiming food law. Just is discussing his experiences and preferences on his blog, and people can do whatever they want with it. He has a sharp tongue is not always PC, and speaks his mind- and sometimes he is enjoyable to read for that alone. I don't know why you have to get so ButtHurt about it. He's just a dude who reviews food locally, started on his own, and people agreed with him enough/enjoyed his posts enough for him to begin to have a following.  Don't follow his shit if you don't like what he says... but no need to flap your cock-washer about how he is a villain because he is friends with some of the people whose restaurants he writes about. You sound like someone personally affected by a bad review to me... no reasonable person would be THAT butthurt about a local food blogger."
GNV,2tryso,Ohhhhhk,3,Tue Jan 27 04:12:48 2015 UTC,At least three of those picks are friends of his. I can't trust a word he puts on paper.
GNV,2tryso,bionicback,5,Wed Feb 4 03:01:48 2015 UTC,Gainesville isn't a very big city… You really expect Ken should only review restaurants of people he doesn't know? That foodies can't be friends with other foodies?
GNV,2tryso,furryoso,-1,Tue Jan 27 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think I made either of those arguments. But when someone says ""this place is the best in Gainesville and everyone in town should give them money"", without disclosing that they know the owner, knew them before they opened the place, and want to see their friends succeed, I find that opinion suspect. I also think it is pretty telling that a lot of the people who know wtf they are talking about when it comes to food in this town have the same opinion as I do. If you look at his reddit posts, a good percentage of them are him trying to argue that he isn't biased. Of course none of that is ""proof,"" but it isn't exactly reassuring either."
GNV,2tryso,kpeng,2,Wed Jan 28 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"Gainesville is pretty small and people in the same industry all tend to know each other.  I don't find it that concerning.  That being said, which are the three that he is friends with?"

GNV,2tryso,kpeng,2,Wed Feb 4 00:00:25 2015 UTC,"If you're going to drag someone through the mud, at least back up your claims."
GNV,2tryso,furryoso,0,Tue Jan 27 23:22:43 2015 UTC,"Since /u/kpeng is posting little snarks here...    Gainesville is pretty small and people in the same industry all tend to know each other. I don't find it that concerning.   This is a great point. That being said, I think you would agree that's there a difference between small town knowing each other and 'hey, let's drink a lot at my house'.   Nowhere in his review of Sabore or his best overall pick does he mention this friendship.  He mentions great things about Crane, and was at some pre-events which doesn't get mentioned in the review. Shockingly, a place that has him over for a pre-taste is a best-pick.  Ken is upfront in saying he's not a journalist. But, he's also not following any disclosures and discussion of bias that even bloggers are expected and required to disclose.  Bigger concerning yet... two advertisers (Midnight Cookies and Cymplify) are named to best lists (and promoted heavily) with no disclosure that they advertise."
GNV,2tryso,bionicback,-1,Wed Feb 4 01:41:07 2015 UTC,"Also, that picture you refer to was posted last night was me meeting with Chef to talk about planning my birthday dinner with some friends. I didn't think that detail was very essential to provide to the public. But since you asked, you're invited. The picture of Crane you posted was a staff meeting where they were trying out new drinks, and I popped in to try some and provide feedback.  I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Being a blogger with significant followers, I'm not sure why it's frowned upon to be invited to some events and behind-the-scenes looks. It doesn't mean I'm biased. Blaze Pizza sent me vouchers to have free pizza so I would review them, it was completely unprompted, and I still did not give them a review. Square One Burgers invited me to a friends and family event to try their food, and I did not give them a positive review. People can't buy my reviews. Nor would I let them. If I really enjoy a place, and we happen to become friends or acquaintances after the fact...is that really so unbelievable?"
GNV,2tryso,annoyingbeggar,-1,Wed Feb 4 00:15:35 2015 UTC,"is that really so unbelievable?   I don't know. Is is normal for the Chef to discuss the dinner over drinks outside the restaurant?  Did you receive the drinks for free at Crane?  You received your meal at Blaze for a discount / free and didn't disclose it? Why?  There's a reason why the FTC requires bloggers to disclose things they receive for free, discounts, etc. The reason is to gain trust and avoid bias. So, don't tell me not to accuse you of being biased when you don't disclose your biases."
GNV,2tryso,carlidew,0,Wed Feb 4 00:30:58 2015 UTC,You are ridiculous. Don't get so upset over me dude. Better things to worry about.
GNV,2tryso,kpeng,1 point,Wed Feb 4 01:53:33 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned it earlier, I became friends with some of these places because we share a similar vision and taste. I didn't know any of these people until I tried the food. Crane? I get invited to events sometimes, is it a surprise? I didn't know a single one of those people before they opened. What's your pick for best new restaurant? I'd like to know.  Midnight Cookies and Cymplify? I reviewed them positively before the advertisements were even posted. They're only there because they (without my prompting) donated to my Kickstarter to help launch my site.   None of this stuff is a secret. It's also not outside the realm to think that people with similar views and tastes can become friends. It's not a very big town, and good restaurants are hard to come by. You can disagree with my picks and my tastes, but don't accuse me of being bias. If anything, I'd be more willing to tell my friends something sucks. Either way, it's a fuckin' food blog, you needn't get so worked up over it."
GNV,2tryso,furryoso,-4,Wed Feb 4 01:56:12 2015 UTC,"The fact that Midnight Cookies and Cymplify donated to you, get reviewed, named to a best of list, and you don't disclose it, is to me a problem. It also is to the FTC... but what do you care?  It does make me not trust you. Simply because you don't disclose the fact that you received money from them. It's a very big issue for negating trust.  I can easily accuse you of being biased because it's a very easy assumption to make. They donate money to you... you don't disclose it... you're supposed to disclose it... and then low and behold in the reviews and lists in which they are named (and not disclosed) they have glorious reviews. This is almost a textbook definition of why one would feel you're biased.  I'm not worked up... I just feel you're biased."
GNV,2tryso,mrrowr,4,Wed Feb 4 00:24:53 2015 UTC,"If this is your main concern, it's understandable to bring it up to Ken but to publicly lash out at him personally is petty and immature at best."
GNV,2tryso,kpeng,1 point,Wed Feb 4 01:47:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've known Ken for a long time. I no longer live in Gainesville but go back to visit a few times a year and when I do I stay with Ken and we go out to eat/drink/etc. The places on this list are his favorite restaurants. Some of them from long before there was a blog, or a facebook, or anything. They're seriously the first places that come to mind when I ask where we're going to eat. It's a struggle sometimes deciding where to go because I like places he doesn't and he likes places that I'm not a huge fan of. I will also say that I've never seen him get, ask for, or expect a discount at any of these places (aside from a free drink or something that most restaurants give their regular customers.)"

GNV,2tgvqk,Gatorphan,6,Sat Jan 24 08:35:56 2015 UTC,Anything really. It's just a venue for atheists to get together and maybe not feel so isolated. I grew up in a Christian family and there was always an instant community due to the church. Atheists don't have that and even in a time when more people are areligious we often feel the need to closet ourselves due to repercussions from any number of places. This will hopefully be a place where atheists can meet others who share their love of reason (and food).
GNV,2tgvqk,DBuckFactory,8,Sat Jan 24 10:21:51 2015 UTC,"Especially in Gainesville, I never felt like religion was ever a big push.  It's pretty free as it is.  The atheist tag on the brunch would make me more likely not to pursue it as I don't really identify myself by my non-religious affiliation, if that makes sense.  I don't need to search for non-religious people as 90% of the people I meet don't really talk about it anyhow.  Good luck on the brunch, though.  Brunches are always tasty."
GNV,2tgvqk,OuiNon,-16,Sat Jan 24 17:19:11 2015 UTC,So silly.  Trying to segregate yourself from others based on your belief? I could see if it was a forum to discuss atheist issues.

GNV,2tgvqk,Ntopper,9,Sat Jan 24 13:33:40 2015 UTC,"The thing is like, pretend to be an atheist (in you aren't already) and drive from here to Tampa and you will see like 15 billboards telling you that you are a bad person and you will go to hell. Or like go to turlington plaza and people will literally be yelling at you for the same reason. I don't think reasonable people take the billboards or doomsayers seriously but it's still frustrating and would encourage people to want to meet people who feel the same way.

When members of a church or political party go to lunch together, is that ""a retreat to eat away from those who think different(ly)"" or would it be more accurately described as ""a chance to enjoy the mental health benefits and logistical benefits of social networking which include conviviality, information about job openings and housing opportunities, and a chance to discuss ways of surviving in a world that won't bend over backwards to accommodate one's wishes""?

Local silversmith and jewelry artist based out of Haile. He's a very, very nice guy, doesn't put any pressure on or anything. I went in on a whim one saturday and he sat with me for almost two hours, just answering any question I had, about jewelry, about diamonds, about his custom stuff (seriously, he makes incredible hand-crafted original items), and the whole time he just was friendly and polite as could be. Offered me drinks, made sure I was comfortable, and even though I was an early-20s male looking at rings, he didn't hound me like other stores had.   This is starting to sound like I'm some sort of shill, but I'm not, I swear. Rick was just such a nice guy, I jump anytime I get the chance to recommend. :)"

Also the interstate overpass on 39th going over 75 headed out of town. Used to bomb that around 2am, got clocked going 45+ there, you just have to time the light at the bottom.

GNV,2suh0j,Athena_Nikephoros,2,Sun Jan 18 17:43:40 2015 UTC,I have several friends who have done many a production at GCP and love working with them.  I'm not an actor myself but I teach next door to a drama teacher at a local high school.  He does a lot of directing for them and he's a great guy.
GNV,2suh0j,keely11,1 point,Sun Jan 18 18:57:31 2015 UTC,GCP is great. I've seen a few plays there. They did an amazing rendition of RENT; I was really impressed.
GNV,2suh0j,carlidew,2,Tue Jan 20 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"GCP is lovely, nice facility. Haven't seen a production there since the remodel (which was a minute ago), but I've heard great things. They tend to do mostly musicals and comedies. The Acrosstown is more of a blackbox so fewer bells and whistles, but I really enjoy it there. The plays they choose are a little more challenging, but I think it pays off in a big way. Both places get awesome regulars, so either way you'll be in good company. Gainesville really is a nice town for theatre folk. Hope you enjoy the town, and break a leg when you get cast!"

GNV,2suh0j,bengraven,2,Mon Jan 19 16:27:14 2015 UTC,"GCP: 4 Musicals and 2 ""straight"" shows a season. Historically geared their shows towards the older crowds, but have been moving towards more contemporary with shows like The Producers, Rent, and Hairspray, though their straight shows tend to be ""I think my mom heard of that one."" Lots of singers and dancers try out for their musicals. Often winds up like the Hippodrome casting the same people over and over again. Higher budgets for sets, props, costumes, lights. Sound can be hit or miss, has a T-Coil for older folks with hearing aids. Tries to be run more professionally, has a large number of board members and committees.  ART: Generally more edgy plays, black box with almost no budget which forces the actors to be on their game. This is a double-edged sword: when they're good, it's very immersive, when they're bad, it's both obvious and dreadful. Often a smaller, more amateur talent pool to draw from and VERY hit-or-miss. Have not done a very good job selecting directors, actors, and shows in the past few years, though that's likely due to the smaller talent pool. Has local playwright shows and staged readings. Past shows include True West, Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol, and Refinery. Board has changed often."
GNV,2su85v,ponz,1 point,Sun Jan 18 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"That being said, this area has gone downhill drastically in the last 5 - 6 years. Once Kennedy Homes was shut down, many residents relocated to the area. Combine that with the housing issues (super high prices at the time Kennedy closed to crash shortly afterwards), it's very difficult for people in that area to just pick up and go.  Sometimes a neighborhood can go from OK to bad to horrible and there's little you can do to leave.  Having spent time in inner cities (NYC, Detroit, Miami), I can tell you this is more like Night to Different time of night."

Our Five Star is the best one in town -- Paul and Michelle do not fuck around and put customer satisfaction at the forefront.   They don't deliver, but the sub shop next to All Star Comics and Cards in the Home Depot center is top-notch. If you like comics, Chet and his minion Fooks are great people (just don't piss off Chet's wife -- she's a sweetie but can be scary).  Doorstep isn't that bad. Mi Apa delivers here through them; their delivery portions are smaller than their dine-in, but if you ever need a dozen Cuban sandwiches on short notice, it's a godsend.   We have no good Chinese/Asian delivery around here. It's a damn shame. However, Yummy House is a very short drive from where you are and it is absolutely top-notch. I intend to bug them about getting a delivery driver because nothing would be better on those really lazy nights.  If you want coffee, forget the Starbucks on Newberry -- go to the Barney's on Tower just off Archer. They serve beer and wine in addition to good coffee, there's much less traffic, and both the seating and the parking are a lot better.   And for the nights you cook yourself real food, don't forget the Haile Plantation Farmer's Market on Saturday mornings.   It's odd, but between my four years at The Gardens, the nearly four years in this house, and the nearly three years I didn't live right here but had reason to come by constantly, our little area of town is near and dear to my heart, no matter how much people shit on it because it's far from UF and downtown. That Kangaroo station is like my second home."

My wife has had several ""blue shirts"" approach her about the issue and only yesterday was the first time she was told that the next time she comes, the fan will not be permitted in the premises. She said it was said in a very threatening way, like they are trying to scare her into not bringing the fan anymore."
GNV,2sgqxn,CacaDeGato,2,Thu Jan 15 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"Try having her get documentation about the sweat and heat issue from a doctor and have her talk to the management there.   Maybe invest in some of those instant ice pack things and a lot of gym towels if they won't allow her to bring in a fan even with the doctor's note?   Unfortunately, GHFC is pretty much the best gym around as far as group classes and some of the other perks. I know Powerhouse have/had some group classes, maybe check there if all else fails?   It seems pretty ridiculous that they're putting you folks through that from a management prospective. They could at least try to compromise, especially considering how much they want per month. Good luck!"
GNV,2sgqxn,CacaDeGato,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:44:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're considering getting a doctor's note, but it just feel ridiculous that we have to do that. They renovated the group fitness room and removed all the floor fans and replaced them with these tiny wall mounted fans that move practically no air. They just want the room to look nice and don't care about the circulation. We get a different story from different ""supervisors"", but one of them finally told us that they removed the floor fans because the owner of GHFC thinks they are detrimental to a good workout because ""the fans are ugly and cause distractions in the class"".  Originally when they removed the floor fans, my wife would just go to the front desk and ask for a fan. A few minutes later they would bring one. After about a month, they started refusing to bring her a fan so this is when we went and bought a small box fan.  We don't really want to quit. We did a 2 year membership because we enjoyed the gym so much and the 2 years is almost up, which means our monthly fee will drop a bit."
GNV,2sgqxn,Gatorphan,2,Thu Jan 15 13:09:24 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised they said something to her. I've gone to the Friday-night yoga class, and during the cold weather, the teacher actually brings in a small heater just to keep our bodies warm while we warm up/cool down.  I agree with the other person that said she may need to bring a doctor's note. It sucks that it comes to that, but if it's medically necessary for her, it seems like they would not be able to turn her away for that.  Which classes does your wife do? I do yoga and a strength class in there every week, and the circulation is usually fine. It seems like it's only the very popular classes that are extremely sweat-inducing, like Zumba (which can have upwards of 50 people packed in there sweating their asses off), that cause the issue. Every class I go to that is after a Zumba class is awful for the first 5 or 10 minutes while the room airs out...those people generate a ton of moisture that takes a while to get rid of. Of course, it was like that at Alter Ego too when I went there, but at least they included a dehumidifier in their group-fitness room to try to assuage the issue."
GNV,2sgqxn,Gatorphan,1 point,Thu Jan 15 13:50:36 2015 UTC,Which classes does your wife do?   She mainly does the Body Combat class. It's in the evening at 5:30 so the sun is coming straight into the windows and it's a popular class so there's lots of people. The gym supposedly installed a dehumidifier to help and this is one of the reasons they gave us for not being allowed a fan. Supposedly it will prevent the dehumidifier from working correctly.

GNV,2s838u,TShreff,3,Tue Jan 13 00:13:38 2015 UTC,"I had a good experience with Campus Credit Union when I took out a mortgage but closed the savings account they made me open soon after because the user interface on their website is appalling.  My fiance and I both use Ally Bank. We each have our own savings and checking accounts there. You and your GF could take out a basic, joint checking account for free, and you get free checks. You can deposit checks from your phone, and you can use any ATM, anywhere, and the ATM fee you pay gets refunded to your account each statement period. There are no monthly fees and no minimum balance to open. I love their website and you can pay bills and send money to people for free from the website or the phone app. You can open an account online in a matter of minutes.  Right now, Ally's checking account rates are .10% APY for balances under $15k and .60% APY for balances $15k and over. (As a comparison, I was getting like .02% in my checking account at my former credit union.) Ally's savings account currently has a rate of .99% APY.  The only downside to Ally is that you cannot deposit cash, as they don't have any brick-and-mortar branches (which is how they are able to offer higher interest rates on accounts). However, as I never handle much cash, this hasn't been a problem for me. If I ever do have a lot of cash, I usually give it to a friend or family member and ask them to write me a check in return."
GNV,2s838u,carlidew,1 point,Tue Jan 13 13:55:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's offered at any banks in Gville, but look for an account type called kasasa cash, it's usually offered by credit union or small, local banks. They offer higher interest (~2.5%) on balances up to around 15K as well as refunded ATM fees in exchange for a few requirements, usually having direct deposit or some sort of ACH done each month and a certain amount of debit purchases. I usually get around 20 bucks or so a month for my bank.    I opened an account with a bank in Wisconsin for this exact type of account. Since online banking exists, and I could link my main account with a BoA account, as long as I planned out my transactions a bit, everything worked out just fine. Unfortunately my bank no longer accepts customers from out of state, so you'll have to look around a bit more. A preliminary web search showed that there is a kasasa account being offered by a credit union in Jax. Give it a look, it may be worth it."

GNV,2s838u,OuiNon,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"IDK if banks even do those specials for signing up anymore, but for a quality local bank I highly recommend VyStar Credit Union. The people who work there are super nice and more importantly they're not set up to gouge you with fees at the drop of a hat and their normal accounts don't have minimum balances. Their loan interest rates are also great if you ever need one.   I do like and recommend a good online bank for savings since you can get better interest rates and because online banks have better web interfaces for managing your money. I use Capitol One 360 (formerly ING) but I think Ally works the same way, you can set up unlimited savings accounts under the same login, and you can set up automatic, recurring transfers so saving and budgeting is a breeze. For example I have an account for auto insurance that gets a monthly deposit so when the 6 month bill comes in I can pay the whole thing up front and get a discount. I have another one for vacations, another for emergencies, etc. Having them all split up into separate accounts makes it really easy to see how much money I can actually afford to spend at any time which I just don't think is possible with one monolithic account. I know local banks will technically allow you to do the same thing but managing them online is usually a hassle and if you have to go in to the branch all the time that adds too much friction to actually get you using it consistently."

GNV,2s0m5z,me3260,4,Sun Jan 11 01:25:28 2015 UTC,"They just genuinely do not care about your experience anymore. I've complained about noise/people on their phones/babies crying/laser pointers and various other things and all they do is come in for 2 minutes to watch, then walk out and don't do anything.   The last 3 times, I've just walked out and got a refund. They just don't care about removing bad people from their theaters, which attracts more bad people."
GNV,2s0m5z,risto1116,5,Sun Jan 11 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"They have zero competition in town. They are the worst theater in the area, and should be embarrassed, but like you said, they don't care.  $12 for a ticket in a dirty small theater with horrible seats. Meanwhile IMAX tickets are $10 at orange park.   I wish AMC would plop down a big imax and run regal outta town."
GNV,2s0m5z,me3260,3,Sun Jan 11 05:31:48 2015 UTC,"I dream of the day a new theater comes to town. When I was in Dallas, there was an independent theater I went to that blew me away.   1) They didn't allow anyone under the age of 14 to see PG-13 or R movies even WITH adults. And absolutely no one under the age of 7 allowed in (I think there was a time cutoff for this though).  2) The seats were HUGE and reclined so far back. PLUS there was like 3 feet of height difference per row. Unless Shaq was sitting in front of you, there was 0 obstruction.  3) The price of 2 tickets, a popcorn and a large drink was EXACTLY $20. No change or breaking cash.   4) Alcohol  5) ZERO tolerance talking/texting policy.   And before anyone asks, no it wasn't an Alamo Drafthouse."

For the life of me I do not understand why in a town of 50,000 students, and countless young professionals how regal has been our only choice for so long.  It's like they are just squeezing every cent they can before anyone other theater realizes wtf is going on.  Anyone feel like riding to Ocala to watch some imax tomorrow ?"
GNV,2s0m5z,Trinza,3,Sun Jan 11 05:47:11 2015 UTC,"IIRC, Regal only owned or built the one on Archer behind the Walmart, then the one that is over by Ballyhoos got bought by Regal. And Regal being Regal decides to only play certain movies at each, thus making it an ass ache to cross town to see a movie. So instead of choice, we get Regal."

GNV,2rzekm,TopherGnv,1 point,Sat Jan 10 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"Very cool.  Not having flown planes or helo's myself I've wondered what sort of learning curve there was once I got the quad built.  I am looking at the 250mm frames.  It seems online is about the only place to source the parts, haven't' found anything locally.  Hobbyking.com seems to have everything and I've seen a lot of parts on Amazon.  Sounds like I should go inexpensive this first go, learn to fly, then build or upgrade to a faster quad."
GNV,2rzekm,TopherGnv,2,Mon Jan 12 16:13:22 2015 UTC,"Cheap parts tend to break easier. Especially frames. I buy my frames from hoverthings.com they ship from down by tampa. Building isn't too bad. I'd say the hardest part is getting your flight controller and remote set up and tuned once tou figure out your weight you will be flying at. I tend to buy stuff I can upgrade. I started out wanting to video, then decided I wanted to do acro, now I'm getting into fpv. With my build all I change out is the motors and props. Just flying isn't too bad to learn. Flying fpv is a bear to get comfortable with."

Most of the setups I've seen have both a dedicated fpv camera and a recording camera like a GoPro or Mobius, but I've also read about ways to fpv and record using a single camera with either the GoPro or Mobius and the onboard flash.  Seems like just added weight with two cameras."

I can also fly from just the sj4000 but it has about a .5 second delay and it doesn't like bright lights or darkness. The cc tv camera is very light and better all around for flying. I'm flying a 450 size quad so weight isn't as much of an issue as As a 250  http://imgur.com/Brd0FnN
GNV,2rzekm,alexxerth,1 point,Mon Jan 12 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"Ok cool.  Delay would be killer especially in/around trees and such.  Makes sense for the dual cameras then.

GNV,2rzxjl,bearkery,2,Mon Jan 12 16:00:14 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to throw in my opinion as a current member. I've been there for about a year and really enjoy the diverse group of members and workouts. Before working out there, I had very little background in ""fitness"" and pretty much always avoided gym settings. They did a good job of scaling the workouts and making sure I was keeping good form. Over the past year, I've ""graduated"" into their more advanced classes and am in pretty good athletic shape (running my first half marathon in Feb and have a sprint triathlon under my belt with an olympic tri in April coming up). So, in terms of ""athletic shape"" it's been awesome. The only ""negative"" I personally have, but know they're quickly working to improve upon it, is that I wish there were more strength focused classes. Usually their ""strength"" days are 1-2x a week, with cardio 1-2x a week, and then mixed/challenge days. So, I suppose it depends on what your goals are really, but like I said... they're working to improve this by offering additional classes, etc. At the end of the day, being a member there has taught me a ton about camaraderie, team work, etc and I truly enjoy the community.

GNV,2rwd8m,gvilleuberdriver,2,Sat Jan 10 05:44:22 2015 UTC,"This is great information, and I will add to this.   San Felasco. If you are wanting long trails, this is the best, while Kerovan is correct that their longest trail is around 6 miles, they are all intertwined, and if you wanted to by doing a combo of them all, you can easily get over 10-12 miles without overlapping anything. Oleno state park outside of High Springs - 25 min away. This is the one I would recommend. Here they have the sweetwater campsite, which is a backpack in site. The site itself is only 3 miles out if you take the short way, or around 5-6 miles if you take the longer routes to extend the hike. This is a really a cool hike as you see where the River goes under ground, and if you are up for a longer hike (2 days) you can hike to the river rise state park and see where the river resurfaces. I think when I hiked to the rise and back it was around 11-12 miles. Kanapaha/Veterans park off Tower Road. If you are a beginner and want to start just walking, this is a great place to do so. They have a 1 mile paved trail around the park that is easy to walk, and you can also do a trail around the lake which will add around 1 mile. This one is great if you are into geo caching or birding. Great for the kids. Barr Hammock. This is a great trail as it is free, and its a 6 mile loop around Barr Lake. I like this one because you see a lot of birds and gators, and you do not see too many people on this one.  Cones Dyke trail - Great trail and nice to get use to hiking in the sun as there is little to no shade on the trail. I recommend doing it in June! Take a lot of water."

There is a great u-pick persimmon place on Newberry Rd and NW 143rd. They have strawberries too, I think, though neither are in season now. I'm not aware of (m)any u-picks set up for winter produce. In the summer, on 27 between Newberry and High Springs there are half a dozen u-pick blue- and blackberry places. The signs go up in early summer when the crop is starting to ripen, it's a nice lazy drive if you haven't been out that way. Many locals selling produce off trucks, too. If you are interested, there are also at least a few maintain-your-own garden plots in the downtown Gainesville area."

GNV,2rqxby,Pulseplug,1 point,Thu Jan 8 19:45:54 2015 UTC,"I really like their format.  Should be plenty of space if you come early, like by 7:30.  Usually we can fit 8-10 people, but if people come close to 8, then the seats get taken by other teams and what not.  It's a popular trivia.  Usually we get there around 7 to snag a table, and sometimes even by then it is crowded!  I'll be wearing a fuzzy hello kitty hat, so you can't miss me ;)  ETA: the picnic tables fit 8 people kinda cramped, but we can pull extra small tables and chairs.  The issues come when all the tables and chairs are taken, then people have to steal stools from palomino or stand around."

They used to be mostly at Display but lately they've been elsewhere.   Another option is just to look at the flyers posted all over downtown. It sounds lame but it seems to be the main way they advertise."
GNV,2rmmeo,AxeEffect3890,7,Wed Jan 7 13:59:06 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  Come to Alachua County Emerging Leaders' happy hour tomorrow at First Magnitude, a local brewery. It's free (unless you want a beer) and a great way to meet young people who are very similar to how you describe yourself.  If you dig movies, The Wooly is a cool place to hang out and they frequently have film screenings. I would also encourage you to check out Video Rodeo, GNV's only independent video store. They specialize in independent films that can be hard to find on Netflix (the streaming version, anyway).  Downtown has a lot of nifty bars, many of which have live music. If you don't want a rowdy scene, there are plenty that are more low-key, specifically The Bull, where you can have a drink AND a conversation."
GNV,2rmmeo,carlidew,4,Wed Jan 7 14:33:54 2015 UTC,"Serious question, since I see it mentioned all the time. Is that really for ""emerging leaders"", or is it just code for young people? I see invites given here before people even know whether the thread is posted by a dropout fence hand or by a young executive.   Not trying to be a jerk. I landscaped 10 years and still shovel out animal pens. Just curious."
GNV,2rmmeo,rightc0ast,3,Wed Jan 7 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, there is no one that decrees, ""Ah yes, you are indeed emerging as a leader, please join us!"" But it does tend to attract a certain demographic of young people that care about the city and what happens in it (though it's far from being a political organization). It used to be more of a social club, but it has evolved into a group of people that volunteer around the city, do cool things like install bike tire pumps downtown, and have a little fun too (visits to the springs, blueberry picking, happy hours, etc.). There are no requirements for what industry you work in either. You can shovel animal pens and still want to get involved.  There is no application process (as there is with Leadership Gainesville), but everyone I have met since joining is very motivated in their careers and personal lives. It's an interesting group of people that knows how to get things done. I've learned a lot and been able to develop some of my own personal skills. (I'm the editor of the bimonthly e-newsletter, so I've honed some of my design and writing skills.)  And it's not just code for young people. ACEL's definition of young people = 22 to 40 or something like that. I have invited many of my friends to join, but some are just not interested in getting more involved. To draw a rough comparison, the people in the group remind me of the kids in high school who liked to join clubs and be involved, rather than just attend because it was the law."
GNV,2rmmeo,carlidew,3,Wed Jan 7 15:56:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. I've wondered every time I've seen it mentioned here.
GNV,2rmmeo,rightc0ast,3,Wed Jan 7 21:58:30 2015 UTC,ACEL sounds cool but I'm pretty much stuck at home until 7:15-7:30 every night so I would get there just in time to watch people leave lol. The Bull looks cool though I'll be checking that out.
GNV,2rmmeo,carlidew,2,Wed Jan 7 14:49:30 2015 UTC,"The happy hours are just one aspect of everything that ACEL does. Several times a year, they also have social/volunteer events that occur on the weekends. :)"

GNV,2rcccy,risto1116,3,Sun Jan 4 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"Students don't bother me. In fact, I specifically prefer university towns. With a few brief exceptions. I've lived on or around college campuses most of my life. As a kid I was an academic brat. These days, I generally prefer to live a bit out from a campus but within easy commute distance to the hubs of diverse activities.    One thing that impressed me about GNV is that it looks like one could live in the NW and still bike to downtown easily. That's something I miss about Austin. Where I currently am, cycling is just not an option if you don't live very close to where you need to be. Even sidewalks are scarce here. This whole area was built up around the assumption of an auto-centric culture. Whereas it looks like much of the entire state of FL is accessible via bicycle or scooter."
GNV,2rcccy,risto1116,6,Mon Jan 5 00:47:38 2015 UTC,"We're definitely bike friendly, and while I enjoy that fact, I wish the cyclers here knew the law better. I can't tell you how many times I've had to slam on my breaks because a cycler is crossing a crosswalk on a red light."
GNV,2rcccy,commiecat,5,Mon Jan 5 00:50:17 2015 UTC,Glad you liked it although I don't understand your confusion with our grid.  Main and University create our quadrants and then the roads count out from there.  You could have four intersections of 2nd and 2nd; one in each quadrant.  Obviously the entire city isn't on a perfect grid but for the most part our roads follow the numbering and naming conventions.

Downtown is appx between E 2nd and W 3rd streets and university and S 3rd avenues. Downtown has a couple of clubs and quite a few bars.  Depending on how you socialize you can check these places out.

GNV,2ra2lq,salil91,2,Sun Jan 4 07:09:57 2015 UTC,"You're best bet would be downtown to meet people. Midtown is more of a, go with friends and get drunk place, than meet good people place.

GNV,2r93j2,OuiNon,4,Sun Jan 4 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"As a cyclist who rides 8th ave frequently I can say that the condition of the bike lane was just fine and certainly no worse than most other lanes in the city.  With that said, bike commuting in Gainesville sucks and is dangerous.  I also don't really see why people cared so much about this tiny little section of road.  It's two lanes east of there anyway, so the bottleneck just moved somewhere else.  There are so many people in this area that really hate cyclists and that sucks, it's a great way to get around town and stay healthy while you do it."
GNV,2r93j2,mtbr311,4,Sun Jan 4 16:39:39 2015 UTC,I drive 8th everyday and barely ever see a cyclist.  Most that I do see are not commuters but there to ride for pleasure and stay on the sidewalk.  It was silly to cut the lanes for a small percentage of people who MAY use it to commute on bike.

GNV,2r93j2,Heyooooh,3,Sun Jan 4 03:09:24 2015 UTC,It wasn't paved because they were doing the experiment to see if the two lane road with bike paths worked better. If it was a success they would have repaved 8th Ave. and permanently striped it for two lines.
GNV,2r93j2,whynotd,4,Sun Jan 4 02:43:36 2015 UTC,"So we would have made it good if people used it when it sucked? I mean the road didn't need a complete repaving, but fixing up the pavement in the bike lanes would have definitely effected the experiment outcome."

Between gas, wear and tear on my car, data on my phone/large data fee if you use an Uber iPhone, Uber's cut, cancelled rides, payroll tax, risking police trouble when there are too many people (no seatbelts) or people bringing open containers in my car, driving when all the drunks are also driving, few people tip, occasional sexual harassment...I'm not sure it's always worth it.

GNV,2qjrhe,Tea_and_Chocolate,3,Sat Dec 27 18:34:53 2014 UTC,"Crystal River.   My first job was working at a dive shop there that specifically catered to people looking to swim with manatees. I grew up swimming with manatees every summer of my life and they're very easy to find on the Nature Coast.  I don't know if the laws have changed since 2012, but Crystal River allows you to touch a manatee if the manatee is close to you and you do not swim at it. You may put one hand on the manatee and rub it (like a big dog) but you may not grab, poke, or pull the manatee.   A lot of manatees enjoy the rubs and will sometimes roll over for you to rub their tummies. They love to be rubbed around the ""armpit"" area, but not up inside their armpits (that's where their nipples are).   Seriously though, do not do anything stupid around manatees and you'll be fine. Stay on the surface to move close to them slowly but do not crowd or corner it. DO NOT DIVE AND HEAD TOWARDS THEM. They are very gentle and will not be aggressive towards you or bite you.   If you want to rent a kayak and explore for your self, I recommend Aardvark Kayak Co in Crystal River. To see manatees, kayak over to Hunters Springs or better yet, Three Sisters Springs.   Or call American Pro Dive Shop or Birds Underwater if you want to get a boat ride over to swim with them."
GNV,2qjrhe,risto1116,1 point,Sat Dec 27 21:38:08 2014 UTC,"Well I went out today in my own kayak not really expecting to see any manatees on account of the temperature and I didn't see any, but I wasn't expecting to still have to deal with uptight people enforcing arbitrary unwritten rules.  That's really what I was asking about in my original post, all the little rules or norms that you would otherwise have to learn from experience.    I took my 8 ft whitewater kayak out to three sisters springs, at your suggestion.  Because I didn't know that there was an area just outside the spring where you can tie up your boat and then swim into the spring I had planned instead to paddle into the spring and, wearing my snorkel mask, roll the boat over, look around a bit underwater, then roll back up.  Well as soon as I rolled back up this old guy who was wearing a USFWS vest, who I assume works as a volunteer, and who was sitting in a kayak across the spring from me sternly calls out ""you need to maintain control of your movement"".  I have no idea what he was talking about.  The boat drifted maybe 3 ft while I was upside down and there weren't any swimmers near me.  I ignored him and paddled over to the other spring and did the same--again, with no people around me.  When I rolled back up I noticed he was on a bee line for me, but when I removed my mask he must have realized I wasn't going to roll again and he stopped.  Just ridiculous.  I can't imagine that there's any rule he was enforcing, just someone who thinks his job is to stop anyone from doing something he hasn't seen before.  I hope the atmosphere around the other springs is more loose."
GNV,2qjrhe,risto1116,1 point,Mon Dec 29 03:26:27 2014 UTC,"I'm truly sorry to hear about that. I've paddled my kayak into Three Sisters hundreds of times, abandoned it to swim freely, and never had a single person give me shit for it. In fact, I usually push my kayak against a tree branch over near the big spring so it won't drift away, which is exactly what the rules tell you not to do (""Do not secure your vessel to any vegetation"").  If people give you shit, ask them what rules you're breaking. But I understand that if you're in an unfamiliar place, it can be hard to stand up in that way. And I certainly don't advise being a dick to anyone. But that guy shouldn't have said anything. You weren't hurting anyone/anything.  I grew up in Crystal River. That little bridge you kayaked under used to be a place where my friends and I would backflip off of. About 30 yards from the entrance to Three Sisters was where one of my friends lived and we would swim from his boat house right into the springs every day in summer. Crystal River is my hometown and I want everyone to have an enjoyable experience there. So hearing FWS people give you shit for something so asinine really pisses me off."
GNV,2qjrhe,reddjoey,1 point,Mon Dec 29 07:12:17 2014 UTC,Just a reminder that manatees are protected by state and federal laws. As amazing as they are it is really easy to get caught up in a legal mess by not following the law.   http://myfwc.com/education/wildlife/manatee/viewing-guidelines/

We left the apartment in far better shape then we received it and still they nickel and dimed us.   It was really one of the worst experiences in my life. It's something I will remember for a long time. Try going an entire year without getting a good night's sleep.
GNV,2qavwz,ciacciojon,1 point,Wed Dec 24 22:34:13 2014 UTC,Wow its terrible that they didn't do anything about the mold and then kept your deposit...probably to fix the mold..Thanks for your input!

GNV,2qavwz,arkansah,3,Sat Jan 3 06:29:58 2015 UTC,"I lived there when I did my undergrad but that was over a decade ago.  Just so you know, these are condominiums there are approximately 230 units and 150 are owned by one person.  So when you get negative comments about a particular unit keep that in mind.  Ask the property manager who runs it.  I own units at UTW and can assure you mine look much better than many other units in the same condos."
GNV,2qavwz,arkansah,1 point,Thu Dec 25 01:38:00 2014 UTC,"ah yes I like your perspective. I'm actually trying to gather information about Tea Tree because I am looking into investing in buying a condo there. As a condo owner, what are your opinions? I will end up living there if I do buy it, at leaset until I finish school, then I'm planning on renting it out. If it weren't for the fact that I will move into the condo I buy, I would definitely look into something off 20th, but I've lived on 20th and I don't want to go back."
GNV,2qavwz,arkansah,1 point,Thu Dec 25 02:31:16 2014 UTC,"My dad suggested that we purchase it back when I first lived there, and honestly I wish we would have done so.  As far as investment purposes, it all depends on the price that you get it at.  I actually looked at a place there  a couple weeks ago that's how I got this info.  The property manager of the HOA also does the leasing for the owner and she said that they will help lease other peoples property once hers are filled.  That is a huge benefit when you end up leaving Gainesvile.  Most importantly, you want to make money on the deal.  Which means that you want to cash flow on the property.  Keep in mind that you're going to have to pay an HOA fee of $155 per month.  Taxes are about $80 per year and you will have to have insurance and set some money aside for maintenance.  Plus whatever your mortgage is going to be.  If you can get in there and get some rents that will cover all of your expenses and give you some decent money in return than it's probably a good idea.  Things that are positive.  From speaking with the HOA manager, she said the association is healthy and has about 400k in reserves.  If true, that means it's probably being managed well and you won't be hit with any special assessments.  I think it's close enough to UF that you will still get a lot of business from there for quite some time.  I don't believe that rents will rise, and they may even drop a little because Gainesville has been letting a lot of people build still.   (this was an error when I bought my first condo. Rents were $475/month per room and then dropped to $400/month/room because a few new apartment places came online.)  Other risks are that the buildings are old.  They were built in 1985 and they may begin having issues.  So again, if you can work out a good deal keeping all that in mind, then I say go for it."
GNV,2qavwz,justjamie,1 point,Thu Dec 25 03:37:18 2014 UTC,"Super informative! I'm glad to hear from someone with the same motivations as I. It seems like most complaints on this thread are about the management, which if I buy the condo, obviously it would be not a problem. As long as the association fees don't sky rocket for some reason, (which they probably will eventually do so because of the age of the building, like you said) it could be a good investment."

GNV,2qavwz,Des_Fury,5,Thu Dec 25 20:32:47 2014 UTC,"Wait, what? No. That can't be right. Domino's on SW 13th St. (the store that delivers to that area, located on 2106 SW 13th St) absolutely DOES deliver to that apartment complex, unless something has changed VERY  recently.   If an employee EVER told you over the phone that they don't deliver there after dark, it was a bold-faced lie. There is a VERY small subset of areas they can NOT deliver to, and that is NOT one of the areas. It is correct that places they do not deliver to are a result of high statistical crime rates (this practice is referred to as ""red lining"", and if not done diligently can lead to legal trouble).  That part of town isn't necessarily fancy (it's pretty close geographically to Sugar Hill, which IS really bad and IS red lined), but it's fine. Tons of students live around there, and the other two complexes right next to it are also fine.  I highly suggest you get in touch with Gator Domino's (local franchise, owns all 8 store in Gainesville + 1 in Starke) to let them know if someone from that neighborhood is being denied delivery. It is most likely not company policy to NOT go there. This is quite frankly absurd.  http://www.gatordominos.com/contact/, the number you're looking for is Gator Domino's Office.  EDIT: Oh, nvm :) Hi, Jamie."

I hear this happens a lot.  I live under people - and you can tell.  Personally, I like hearing people walking around, it makes me feel less alone/creeped out by living alone, eh maintenance requests are slow, although this has gotten MUCH better since they made their website. their ""gym"" is pretty much useless, but I have never lived in an apartment complex where the gym was worth a shit anyway...   now the good:   super cheap.  I live in a 2/1 and I pay under $600/month.  I can afford to live alone and not feel like I am in a tiny tiny place Very close to UF - I walk to work now.  No more paying for parking passes or gas.   people are nice.  and its quiet.  I have only had one night where I even CONSIDERED asking my neighbors to be a little quieter, and it was the last day of classes (understandable party) hot water is really hot.  like really hot.  Plus you share water heaters with everyone.  Which is good and bad, because water pressure can be an issue, but you don't pay for water, so I chock that up as a positive. there is a cinder block wall between the apartments.  This is REALLY great for insulation.  My utility bill is usually around $50/month even in the summer.   they actually maintain the pools twice per week, which is cool, because there are a lot of pools, and you know they are clean (I creep on the pool guys on Monday and Friday to make sure they clean the pools)   Just my two cents!"
GNV,2ppn4j,furryoso,4,Thu Dec 18 19:38:58 2014 UTC,"North Central Florida residents stuck in the health insurance coverage gap can find help at safety net clinics listed in a directory compiled by the nonprofit WellFlorida Council.  The directory lists doctor’s officers and organizations in 16 Florida counties, including Alachua and Marion, that provide medical, dental and mental health care and other services for free or on a sliding fee scale to people without insurance.  Lauren Vagelakos, the program manager for the WellFlorida navigator program, said the organization put together the directory because its team of navigators found that many of the people seeking assistance signing up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act could not get it because they fell in what has come to be known as the coverage gap.  “It was a pretty upsetting experience for the application assisters when you help someone and they think they’re going to get insurance for the first time and they walk away with nothing,” Vagelakos said.  Individuals in that gap make too little to qualify for the tax subsidies offered as financial assistance to purchase coverage. They also did not qualify for Medicaid because the Legislature did not move forward with the Medicaid expansion included in the Affordable Care Act, which offered health care coverage to individuals with income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.  The listed facilities include the Alachua County Organization for Rural Needs (ACORN) clinic, which has mental and dental clinics and mental health counseling; the Heart of Florida Health Center; the federal qualified health center in Marion County; and the Healthy Start program, which provides services for at-risk pregnant women, infants and small children.  The directory is available online at the main WellFlorida website, www.WellFlorida.org, or www.NCFNavigators.org for theWellFlorida navigator program that assists people in signing up for health insurance through the ACA.  On the site for the navigator program, click on resources on the top of the home page to get to the directory. On the main WellFlorida site, click on resources and then on special publications.  Because of budget constraints, WellFlorida did not print off enough copies of the directories to distribute them. But the navigators who help people sign up for coverage each have a copy and are able to run off copies of the pages listing the safety net clinics that serve the area where a person coming in for assistance lives."

GNV,2phypf,gnvivvie,12,Tue Dec 16 19:41:12 2014 UTC,"Depends on the department.  As someone who has done hiring at UF, here is how the process works.  I submit a job to UF admin, who then places the position opening on jobs.ufl.edu for you to see.  The minimum time the job can be up is 1 week, the average time is 2 weeks.  You must wait the 1-2 weeks before receiving the applications.  For the position we hired back in February, the job was open for 2 weeks and we received 140 applicants.  Each of these had to be gone through and we settled on interviewing 3 candidates for the job.  Those were scheduled by our department admin, and the whole interview process took about 2 weeks from scheduling to completion.  We then had to actually hire the person and wait for UF admin to do their entry paperwork, background check, etc.  From start to finish it took about 5 weeks.   all about connections or am I just hopeless?   More or less.  Most of the jobs you see on jobs.ufl.edu are already claimed, but they have to be available to be applied to even if the person doing the hiring already has a candidate in mind.  That said, I got my job at UF having known absolutely no one in the system, so it can be done.  Apply to everything you think you remotely qualify for."
GNV,2phypf,Concise_Advice,3,Tue Dec 16 20:20:10 2014 UTC,"I work here and have done hiring here.  The most important thing to remember--and as concise_advice already said--is that most of the postings you see are for jobs where they already know who they are going to hire.  Let's say there is a secretary in a department that they want to promote to a better position within the same department.  They cannot just promote them, they have to post the job to jobs.ufl.edu and the secretary has to apply and interview for that job.  Everyone has already decided the secretary is getting that job, but they are required to post it, and over 100 people will apply for it thinking they have a chance.  The same thing happens if you move someone from one position to another.    Our department also usually interviews about three people for each opening, and we definitely get over 100 applicants each time.  Usually 90% of the applications are clear copy/paste jobs and show no actual understanding of the position.  Our shortlist always consists of people who have read our website and show an understanding of what the job entails.    Usually a few people who make it to the interview STILL don't really know what the job is or what our unit does."
GNV,2phypf,systranerror,2,Wed Dec 17 13:58:21 2014 UTC,This is all true.  I'd also like to add that the applicant pools routinely get to over 500 (or did when I was hiring less than a year ago).  It's tough to stand out with that.
GNV,2phypf,DBuckFactory,1 point,Wed Dec 17 15:51:09 2014 UTC,"In my experience, this is the case almost everywhere in regard to anything but entry-level positions."
GNV,2phypf,gesis,3,Wed Dec 24 17:46:39 2014 UTC,"Be persistent. I applied regularly for about 18 months and had about 4-5 interviews before I finally got a job at UF. Each interview you get, if you don't get hired, you get better for the next interview. It helps tremendously if you know someone that can vouch for you.  Also - what kind of jobs are you applying for?"
GNV,2phypf,WiseDonkey593,3,Tue Dec 16 23:46:35 2014 UTC,"Word of advice:  if the job posting is ridiculous detailed as far as qualifications, it is likely that it is an internal transfer or promotion."
GNV,2phypf,Lilusa,2,Wed Dec 17 15:54:12 2014 UTC,"I applied, got a phone interview, had the flu on the interview, impressed the interviewers with some answers, blew others, totally, never heard back.

GNV,2phypf,TheCandyColoredClown,1 point,Tue Dec 16 19:44:53 2014 UTC,"It is extremely slow.  There's an application period that you can usually see when applying.  Often, the hiring manager will wait until the end of that before deciding who to contact."
GNV,2phypf,sahuxley,1 point,Tue Dec 16 20:09:06 2014 UTC,It takes time because unless it is urgent they will wait for a certain amount of time before processing applications.
GNV,2phypf,YeshilPasha,1 point,Tue Dec 16 21:54:16 2014 UTC,"I would say it depends. In my department, they needed someone right away so they contacted me almost immediately after the posting closed. I came in for an interview and was offered the job right after my final interview (which was about a week after my first interview). So, it was pretty fast.  When I got a promotion it took about six months and several re-postings of my old position for them to find someone they liked. So, it can definitely vary from what I've seen.  This particular job was entry level, so there was no one in the office ""earmarked"" for the position. You're probably going to have better luck with jobs listed as Coordinator I or Program Assistant since there most likely won't be anyone else in the office with their eye on the job (unless lateral moves are common in that department).  EDIT: I had no real ""connections"" to UF, though I had already applied to another entry level job in the same department and was turned down for that one before I interviewed for the second job. So, they knew I wanted to work in that office and one of the people who interviewed me for the first job actually put in the good word for me. Very lucky for me, and a reason to make a good impression on every interview, even if it's not a job you're ecstatic about!"
GNV,2phypf,hakubiwashuu,1 point,Wed Dec 17 15:06:58 2014 UTC,I actually just got hired at the O'Connell center. They got back to me about 2 weeks after applying and then scheduled an interview immediately. They emailed me 2 hours after the interview that I got the job and I had orientation and could begin working that week. I highly recommend looking when their next hiring period is because it is a very flexible and easy job. They probably will hire somewhere in January or February I would assume so maybe go check out their site and see!

Outdoor cats in Gainesville have it pretty good, so don't feel too bad if you need to keep them as outside cats. Just keep feeding them and they'll stay fat and happy!   Also, the vaccines they receive are rabies and a FVRCP combo shot, which is for feline rhinotracheitis virus (feline herpes or ""kitty cold""), calcivirus, and panleukopenia. So if someone asks if they've been vaccinated against those, you can say yes! There's not actually such a thing as feline distemper, not sure why people refer to it as that."

GNV,2p18fn,kpeng,6,Sat Dec 13 20:44:08 2014 UTC,"Hey there, this is Ken from Ken Eats Gainesville. I understand this is the internet, and hidden behind the cloak of your anonymous keyboard, things can be said that otherwise wouldn't be. But I took exception to this comment. I would like to address your points. Firstly, I'm not quite sure where you got your ""Ken shits on non-hipster places"" comment. I have written negatively about The Jones, Daily Green, and made it entirely too well known that I am not with the non-GMO gluten-free fad. I took a look at some of your other posts, where you recommend places like Vine, Civilization, The Jones, and The Fat Tuscan. Some of my favorite restaurants are nowhere near downtown or even remotely close to being called ""hipster"". Whatever that convoluted label means. So if you're going to accuse me of something, at least have the courtesy not to be a hypocrite.  Secondly, I do not get paid to say good things about restaurants. I say good things because I like them. And if you go to any of those restaurants, you will likely see me frequent them and PAY for my meals. Go ahead and ask any of those restaurants if they give me free meals, or ask any of the many people who have seen me dining out if they've seen a restaurant refuse my payment. I do what I do so people like you can come on to Reddit and spew your vitriol. Do I want to make some money off of it? Yes, it takes up a lot of my time and empties my wallet. Is the integrity of what I write of utmost importance to me? Abso-fuckin'-lutely. So this is not appreciated, and if this is what you think, you are very much so mistaken.  See, unlike you I don't hide behind a computer screen. It's pretty well known what I look like. You've probably even run into me before. If you have a complaint, or some criticism over what I do, I'd be happy to talk over a beer. But if you choose to talk negatively about me, at least get your facts straight, you'll come off much more credible that way."
GNV,2p18fn,team140,9,Sat Dec 13 23:21:47 2014 UTC,"As diverse as Gainesville is for it's food offerings, none of it is really fantastic. Southern Charm Kitchen is a standout. Sawamura has some of the best scallops in town. Everything else is honestly middle of the road as far as having ""wow factor.""  This was made even more evident by a recent trip to San Francisco. A little hole in the wall restaurant named House of Nanking was the only restaurant in Chinatown with a line out the door long enough to block out two adjoining shops. All my life I thought Chinese food style chicken was supposed to be tough and covered with thick goop. IT was outstanding. Best Chinese food I've ever had.  Thinking it was a fluke, we also tried North India and was again blown away by the food. With the exception of a small pizza joint in the Wharf that was bland at best, every meal we had in S.F. was better than anything Gainesville has to offer with very few exceptions.  I think a lot of the restaurants here aren't brave enough to step out of their comfort zones to try something really amazing with their menus and go for a middle of the road approach to satisfy the majority.  So, my advice is to find a cuisine to serve and don't cater to the masses by building an average meal - make it incredible."

Some place that pushes boundaries, isn't afraid to experiment but skilled enough to know what works. Some place that isn't stealing all their best ideas straight from whatever big-city restaurant they visited last or saw on TV or whatever.   It won't ever happen though. It wouldn't make money here, drunk college kids can't tell the difference and would rather go to shit holes like Dragonfly because (while overpriced) it is cheaper than the kind of place I want while still tasting the same to them."

Most of your friends likey may not have eaten before at a really good Indian restaurant and have very little to compare it against.

GNV,2p3kp9,MiloNostrand,7,Fri Dec 12 18:18:49 2014 UTC,"Help me understand. As a non-protesting-kinda-person, I can't understand protests that cause harm in any way - whether it's financial, physical, disruptive, or anything that causes uninterested or uninvolved parties duress.  I completely understand an organization holding peaceful protests to raise awareness and to educate people who are curious as to the reason for the protest.  What I don't understand are the tactics I see on that page. The group has issued a letter to the UF President (When was it issued? Was it mailed? Was it hand delivered? Was it placed directly in the hands of the intended recipient? None of that is mentioned. It could have been delivered yesterday and UF hasn't had the time to form an appropriate response yet.) The letter gives UF the ""opportunity to choose sides"" in the issue and then threatens to ""march"" if their response isn't received in a favorable way. I don't know what the march will entail, but with hashtags such as #ShutDownUF it doesn't sound like they will be there to raise awareness to those who want to know more.  The traffic stopping protest this past Monday was also a really scummy thing to do in order to cause duress to people who are potentially uninvolved and/or uninterested. Those particular people may have had a neutral view on the protesters until that moment where they were blocked from going home after a hard day at work or they wound up stuck in traffic on their way to the ER with some sort of ailment. Not only that, but the organizers failed to inform the city or authorities that the march was taking place. GPD had to react to the situation instead of being proactive and getting detours up and ready.  As someone who was originally leaning toward the view of the protesters, but still teetering in the middle, these two episodes, along with all of the other blatantly childish and irresponsible protesting tactics have turned me away.  I'm all for you hearing your voices heard. I'll help you scream it. Just do it responsibly and those that you are up against will respect you more for it and be more likely to actually listen to what you have to say."
GNV,2p3kp9,team140,4,Fri Dec 12 19:27:40 2014 UTC,"Thank you.  This poorly thought-out event is simply a protest for the sake of protesting.  Of COURSE UF, a public state-funded entity, is not going to respond to something like this. Why would they?  If these protesters were smart, they would have asked the police department or the city to take a stand. That makes slightly more sense than asking a school to take a stand.   The picture on the website is now claiming that by not responding, UF chose to stand ""on the wrong side of history.""   The lack of logic in their argument and protest only weakens the effect of their protest."

Plus gas of course but that car also got like 40 mpg, so it wasn't even that bad. The only downside was that you need a $200 deposit, but it's refunded if you bring the car back in the same condition.

GNV,2ov43y,cheddar_grits_AMEN,7,Wed Dec 10 14:00:54 2014 UTC,"2009 - 2014  hasn't seen that much change. We've mostly been recovering from the crash. And the bigger changes are more recent.  Some things off the top of my head:  Buritto Bro's moved in 2006ish but that church was erected somewhere around 2010.  Those new appartment/condos on 2nd and 5th or so went up in 2011-2012.  They connected 34th and 43rd (behind butler plaza) sometime between 2008 - 2012.   UF has put up a bunch of new buildings.  ""Downtown"" has expanded slightly north up Main and slightly west up 2nd. The place I remember as the Covered Dish is no longer ""Common Grounds"" but ""High Dive"" and the place across the street destroyed a few restauranteur's dreams before settling down as Jones' B -Side (now the only side.)    Some dude crashed into the overpass at the Williston Rd exit, destroying the eastern most lane, but that got repaired rather quickly.   They built a ""super"" Walmart on Waldo south of Tacachale, closed the creepy Walmart on 13th next to Sam's and built another ""super"" Walmart behinf the FHP station on the 34ths extension and 441. I think the Home Depot or Lowes or both or whatever on 441 and 53rd is pretty new too, I don't get over on that side of town too much.   Town of Tioga has become much more popular. Everything that way has become more of whatever it is supposed to be.   You know that place behind Butler Plaza that used to be a trailer park but the the guy kicked everyone out or whatever so he could develop it, and then that fell through or something and it was basically a ghost town that looked like a place serial rapists would drag their victims?  Yeah, the just deforested it and are in the process of developing that into who knows what sort of modern materialistic monstrosity.  That's all I've got."

GNV,2ov43y,addem67,6,Fri Dec 19 18:25:23 2014 UTC,"The University has expanded and so has the overall population.  The infrastructure hasn't been designed with that in mind, so traffic is worse than it was and access to downtown areas is pretty difficult.  In my opinion it's on the way to having typical big city problems.  As such, the town is expanding outwards toward Alachua and Newberry which were once little bedroom communities but are becoming more densely populated especially since it's very cheap by comparison to live in the ""burbs.""  UF and Shands have exploded and are building new facilities every day.  Good jobs with decent salaries seem hard to come by.  That's my ""ACR"" synopsis."
GNV,2ov43y,mtbr311,26,Fri Dec 12 10:06:11 2014 UTC,"The massive westward sprawl.  Butler Plaza is already so big and a traffic nightmare, and now they have destroyed the beautiful trees behind it and are making it even bigger.  Housing developments sprawl way down Archer Road, toward Newberry and Alachua.  No one wanted to live that far away and have to fight traffic before.  Apparently people don't mind now. More likely it is because they want to be sure the kids go to ""good schools"" meaning mostly white schools.    Another new thing is the apartments that have been built and are planned to be built. UF and Santa Fe aren't growing, so I wonder who is going to fill all these housing units.  The people who move to the areas not close to UF or downtown don't even get a feel for what Gainesville is like.  They could be Anywhere USA.  I have had people tell me they don't like ""Gainesville"" but all they do is go to their job and go home to an apartment in west Gainesville. They don't participate in Gainesville life at all, yet they say the don't like Gainesville.   We need to plant a lot more trees to make up for all the ones who have lost their lives on Archer Road and behind Butler Plaza.   Oh, another big change is the demolition of Alachua General which meant so much to the community since 1928.  Shands could not stand to have a competitor, so it was leveled.  How many other towns have such a big hospital cleared away down to the dirt so you can't even tell it ever existed?"

So the people who live there and say they don't like living in Gainesville actually don't live in the City.

When I graduated and moved into Gainesville, sometimes I'd just go to a show just for something to do. Local shows were frequent and often under $5, so even if you happened across a band that wasn't your thing, you didn't spend too much money to find that out."

Shands could not stand to have a competitor, so it was leveled. How many other towns have such a big hospital cleared away down to the dirt so you can't even tell it ever existed?   Incidentally, the same thing happened in Jacksonville a couple years before on sort of a smaller scale. There are a lot of parallels though. Riverside Hospital was begun in about 1911, St. Vincent's in 1916. Like AGH and Shands, they were only just a couple of blocks from one another, and also grew up into being sizable hospitals (St. Vincent's is currently in the mid-500 bed range, and at the time of being acquired, Riverside was at about 200, which is comparable in scale to Shands's ~1100 to AGH's 500-ish). However, like Gainesville, Riverside is not nearly population dense enough to support two hospitals that are just a mile or so apart, and so St. Vincent's acquired Riverside Hospital in 1991, and did the same sort of puppeteering that I imagine Shands did with AGH after that acquisition (I'm not as familiar with the Shands/AGH relationship, though), before ending the song and dance and demolishing the last vestiges of Riverside Hospital in 1998/99.   As someone who is interested in health care and its history, although not employed in the field, I get the impression that -- due to the way that medicine developed and has grown up in the US, and how infrastructure and neighborhoods have grown up around health care systems -- this sort of relationship is probably fairly common. This is all just from a layman's perspective though, as I said, so it is just what I have gleaned from growing up around and reading about hospitals."

It's also nice to not go from civilization to nothing in like, a single block. Or ""nice area"" to ""ghetto"" in a single block. The more things are renovated and expanded, the better it is.

Most of the western movement began in the 90s so the expansion down Archer and Newberry roads is more of a ""what's changed in 15-20 years?"".   NW 5th ave (by El Indio) used to be super hood but they tore down the section 8 housing and there are nice apartments there.  SW 2nd ave east of 13th street had the same thing happen. A bunch of abandoned old buildings were torn down for new apartments. This was done because...  I don't have the biggest problem with AGH (saying this as someone born there, who's grandfather worked as a surgeon there for 40 years). We already have 2 major hospitals in town, a minor third one wasn't needed and modernizing AGH would have cost untold millions. Instead we are getting the innovation square where the city gives incentives for tech companies to move in. We are already seeing this move pay dividends with both local companies like Grooveshark and Sharpspring as well as major internationals like Mindtree.  In this same time period (contrary to claims east Gainesville gets nothing) there have been several new parks, the super WalMart, the new airport roadwork, and an extension to Eastside high added.  Also, UF built several new medical buildings, a new stadium (lacrosse), and a couple new business school buildings.

I am more worried about the Lucky's on 13th that is about to open.  It is similar to TJ's but geographically closer to Ward's.

GNV,2oos35,RTukka,5,Mon Dec 8 23:02:10 2014 UTC,"The challenges are great (though that is true of just about any business), but not insurmountable.  Shops like this can't aggressively compete with online retailers on price, and the Internet even renders informed staff superfluous to a certain extent, since there are so many solid online gaming communities and YouTube channels that offer really good recommendations and demonstrations of the games (plus the retailers themselves sometimes offer good algorithmic recommendations, have informative comment systems, etc).  So really the main competitive advantage for shops like this is that they can offer a pleasant, gamer-friendly venue to play the games, meet other players, and run/host events that are of interest to their customers.  I've contemplated opening/managing a shop like this, and I came to the conclusion that there are a few things I could try to do to maximize its chances of success: I'd want to make sure the place had a cool, comfortable, gamer-friendly atmosphere, comfortable seating, high-quality playing surfaces, and that I'd want to serve refreshments a cut above convenience store fare, without going full-blown restaurant or cafe (maybe a very simple cafe-style menu to supplement the snack food options). And that I'd need to make every reasonable (economical) effort to tap into the existing local gaming communities and foster/expand them.  Yeah, quite a challenge. I wish these guys the best of luck."

A 66-year-old Gainesville man surrendered early Monday morning after police say he fired a shotgun inside his apartment and held a woman captive for a short time.  William Stoffs of 3600 SW 20th Ave., unit 4, and his roommate argued over her cellphone before the woman got it back and hid in a bedroom to text her boyfriend at around 5 a.m. according to a Gainesville Police report.  Stoffs then fired a shotgun, and the round went through the front window as the woman hid in a closet and called 911, police said.  After police arrived, the woman was able to leave the apartment at around 5:40. GPD officers, including the Negotiations Response Team, persuaded Stoffs to leave the unit at 8:22 a.m., the report said.

GNV,2olzg9,gainesville123,6,Mon Dec 8 03:16:32 2014 UTC,"Hi, I'm a criminal defense attorney in South Florida. Grew up in Gainesville. This may or may not be the answer that you want.   Getting an early term probation is incredibly easy. In fact, most ASAs will just agree to it if you've been a good probation candidate. Meaning the defense attorney that you hire will direct his paralegal or secretary to do a form ""agreed order,"" which will be walked over to the judge who handled your case and signed.   Assuming you don't have a bitch of an ASA working your file, and you completed all requirements, please please don't spend your money on a fancy schmancy attorney to do this.   Hire someone you know, a family friend, someone who won't overcharge you. If you do decide to hire one of the more expensive, well known criminal defense attorneys in town, make sure you tell them what you know at the consult. You shouldn't pay more than a hundred bucks for this. If that."
GNV,2olzg9,jkgator11,1 point,Mon Dec 8 12:04:13 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much for the detailed reply! Incredibly helpful.

GNV,2olzg9,throwwout123,3,Mon Dec 8 13:46:49 2014 UTC,"You should wait until you are halfway done. The judges we have on the bench right now will not entertain motions for early term before the halfway point without exceptional circumstances, and I would expect the ASA to object. After the halfway point, if you have had no violations, it is a fairly simple motion unless the State objects. If the State objects you will need a hearing, and will want a skilled attorney to represent you there.  Source: I'm a criminal defense attorney in Gainesville."

The Judge would then forward a copy of your letter to the prosecutor and the probation officer to get their input. If your probation officer has directed you to contact the judge to request for early termination, you have a good chance of the Judge granting a written request you make yourself.  Any attorney would be able to help you with this, but there are better uses for your money other than hiring an attorney without first trying this yourself.  You would address it to the Judge's attention at: 220 South Main Street Gainesville, Florida 32601  Make sure that you include your case number in the letter, your full contact information, and sign and date it.  The worst case scenario is that the Judge would not grant it based on your letter request -- and then you can spend the money to have an attorney handle the matter for you. You don't make your chances worse by trying it yourself directly first.  Good luck!"

GNV,2odb7s,Lilusa,5,Fri Dec 5 15:25:23 2014 UTC,"In reversal, city votes to four-lane 8th Ave. By Morgan Watkins Staff writer Published: Thursday, December 4, 2014 at 6:01 a.m. The City Commission voted early Friday to reverse its prior, controversial decision to reduce vehicle lanes on a segment of Northwest Eighth Avenue, deciding instead to expand it back to four lanes.  For much of Thursday night, City Hall was packed with people interested in the fate of the road. The commission was tasked with providing guidance to its staff regarding a final design for the resurfacing project.  The plan is to do resurfacing work as well as some reconstruction on a 3.3-mile portion of Eighth Avenue from around Northwest Sixth Street to Northwest 40th Drive. The roughly $3.6 million for the project would come from local-option gas-tax funding.  Thursday night's debate centered on a segment of the street -- just under a mile long -- that runs between Northwest 23rd and Northwest 34th streets near Loblolly Woods Nature Park.  The commission voted 4-3, with Commissioners Lauren Poe, Helen Warren and Randy Wells in dissent, just before 1 a.m. Friday to move forward with a design that would expand that part of the road back to four lanes.  The City Commission had previously in a 4-3 vote in December 2013 settled on reducing that segment from four vehicle lanes to two and adding bicycle lanes. That section of the road was restriped from four lanes to two for a trial period that started in August 2013 -- a configuration the commission decided last December to keep until construction begins next year.  Mayor Ed Braddy and Commissioners Todd Chase and Yvonne Hinson-Rawls voted last December against reducing the lanes but Poe and Wells supported it along with two former commissioners.  Warren and Commissioner Craig Carter were elected since then, and they got their chance to vote on the issue Thursday night after a lengthy back-and-forth discussion but ended up on opposite sides of the issue.  City staff offered four design options for the reduced-lane portion of Northwest Eighth Avenue, three of which kept it at two lanes and the last of which expanded it back to four lanes.  The four-lane option that was ultimately selected by the commission incorporates 10-foot-wide sidewalks -- wider than the other options -- because of the lack of bicycle lanes in that design, according to the staff presentation. The sidewalks would function as a multi-use path for both pedestrians and bicyclists, with a painted line down the middle dividing the cycling side of the path from the pedestrian side.  However, the commission also directed staff to look into the feasibility of an alternative design that would still have four vehicle lanes but would also add a median with a refuge for pedestrians crossing the street.  The board additionally asked for that segment of Eighth Avenue to be restriped back to four lanes soon.  Many have weighed in on the Eighth Avenue issue, including the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce, which supported expanding the road back to four lanes.  A recent anonymous survey of the Gainesville Police Department's sworn officers also demonstrated majority support for returning to a four-lane configuration, with 80 percent of those who responded saying the lane-reduction changes have impeded emergency responses to service calls.  Early on in the commissioners' discussion Thursday evening, Carter said he would support Option No. 4, which would expand the roadway back to four vehicle lanes. One of the things he ran for City Commission on was that he didn't like narrowing lanes, he said.  The other commissioners weighed in as well.  “Never before have I seen so many people so invested in such a small space,” Commissioner Yvonne Hinson-Rawls said of the short segment of road that was under debate.  It demonstrates how important Eighth Avenue is to the entire community, she said.  Referring to the divisive views on the Eighth Avenue issue, Commissioner Todd Chase said that, in the end, he knows all the data, polls, surveys, facts and anything having to do with this matter can support whatever opinion someone has.  For Chase, Option Four, with its four-lane configuration, has and continues to be the one he feels is right.  Commissioner Lauren Poe pointed out this is a project that has been 20 years in the making and has gone through many iterations since it started being discussed in 1995.  According to Poe, it really comes down to three elements: Roads are public places that belong to all people, roads need to be safe for all users at all times, and roads need to be effective and function well.  “We have a vested interest in drawing the most users to any public space that we have, including roads, because the more users we have the more owners of that corridor we have,” Poe said.  He personally has supported a two-lane option that included buffered bicycle lanes.  When Braddy got his turn to speak, he said the argument that moving to two vehicle lanes has calmed traffic isn't supported by the data.  Under two lanes or under four lanes, there's still a speeding problem, he said. Dealing with that will come down to enforcement, not design, he said.  The vast majority of motorists have said they want four lanes, Braddy said, and bicyclists have shown they prefer to be out of the road when they ride.  The final, four-lane option is a rare opportunity for a win-win-win, Braddy said. Motorists get four lanes, bicyclists get a separated cycle track, and pedestrians and joggers get their own space, too.  When members of the public finally got their chance to comment around 11 p.m., they started lining up to speak. Many of them advocated for a return to four lanes, but some supported two lanes.  “First, I think that taking away the two lanes has caused unnecessary aggravation for a lot of people, and inconvenience, especially during rush hour,” one Gainesville resident said.  Most importantly, she said, it's easier for emergency vehicles to navigate a four-lane road than a two-lane one.  However, Arnall Downs, who lives on Eighth Avenue, showed the commission a petition with 727 signatures in favor of the two-lane design option with buffered bicycle lanes.  She and others are worried about the risk that a four-lane road without a median poses for children crossing the street, she said.  “I think if the commissioners do the right thing, they'll vote for two lanes,” Downs told The Sun shortly before the vote. “If they don't care about the future of the children of Gainesville, they'll vote for four.”  Another man said the difference between the two-lane and the four-lane options are night and day in terms of his family's safety.  “My heart sinks when I look at the four-lane option and think about crossing that road,” he said.

GNV,2odb7s,mtbr311,6,Sat Dec 6 00:43:10 2014 UTC,"Beyond the abhorrent partisanship that this issue represented, it also normalized our community making complicated decisions about the future (in this case, transportation) needs of Gainesville without the help of good data/information and technical experts. The transportation/planning city staff were explicitly instructed to not discuss or get involved in this issue, leaving the commission and citizens to decide the fate of this road using charged political rhetoric instead of all of the tools of a profession whose purpose is to help communities make these types of decisions. This is particularly inexcusable given that we have the best university in the state in our city, and instead of using the resources of our best local minds, we are presented with the same type of rhetoric that a climate-change denier or an anti-vaxxer might say of scientific consensus:   Commissioner Todd Chase said that, in the end, he knows all the data, polls, surveys, facts and anything having to do with this matter can support whatever opinion someone has.   As with global warming and public health, this type of statement is excellent for politics, but terrible for informed decision making and planning for our future. It trivializes expertise and suggests that some of the best tools we have as a society to make these types of decisions are equally as suspect as one individual's opinion and unscientific polls and surveys.  As we residents compete for different versions of the good life, we can't completely take the politics out of planning for the future of our city. This doesn't mean, however, that we should allow our politics to be anti-intellectual. If the City of Gainesville wants to attract the brightest minds to come work in our innovation economy, our government is going to have to set a better example for how we solve our problems."
GNV,2odb7s,furryoso,9,Mon Dec 8 16:55:53 2014 UTC,"I guess I don't really get the whole controversy here.  As someone who often rides a bicycle on 8th ave, it is nice to have a bike lane for us.  There are often joggers and pedestrians on the sidewalk and when you're riding down that hill it's dangerous to be going 20+ mph on the sidewalk with pedestrians.  As for the four lane configuration, I don't really see what difference it makes since the road starts out in two lanes and only temporarily becomes four lanes anyway.  If I recall correctly the traffic studies done showed that the two lane configuration actually sped traffic up, the opposite of what most of the most passionate about the issue though.  Bike commuting in Gainesville is fucking terrible which blows me away consider how shitty it is to drive a car downtown."
GNV,2odb7s,gesis,12,Sat Dec 6 01:41:41 2014 UTC,"One of the reasons the 4 lane configuration won out, is because police said that having two lanes was causing difficulties for emergency response.    The new mayor also feels we shouldn't cater to cyclists because they make a very small percentage of commuters."
GNV,2odb7s,jtrez,10,Fri Dec 5 17:41:51 2014 UTC,"Well, I don't believe we should cater to bicyclists when we have some pretty heavy traffic. Anyone that has to drive on NW 34th St, NW 8th Ave, 16th Ave, etc knows that traffic can be brutal. Very slow, and very bad roads. To make the roads worse for cars to appease bicyclists should not be a priority compared to redesigning roads to accommodate increased vehicular traffic as well.  Bicyclists get very angry when you suggest they share the sidewalk; insisting that cars give up a lane instead. With limited resources, bad roads, and heavy traffic... we do need to prioritize for the community's best interest.  To me, the number of vehicles vs bicycles and the police/fire opinion make this a simple choice."
GNV,2odb7s,devMartel,9,Fri Dec 5 18:37:03 2014 UTC,"Cyclist are legally entitled to use the roadway.   Additionally,  it is safer for all involved if they do,  even if it causes someone to be two extra minutes later to work.   Bikes + pedestrians = collisions. Especially in an area where cyclists are going to be going at car speeds.  Wide sidewalks are a compromise,  but let's not kid ourselves into thinking it's a solution."
GNV,2odb7s,figuren9ne,6,Fri Dec 5 22:24:43 2014 UTC,"Biking on the sidewalk is more dangerous (even though biking in the road is more scary.)  Also, sidewalks aren't exactly the smoothest surface...."
GNV,2odb7s,furryoso,5,Fri Dec 5 22:55:56 2014 UTC,Biking in this temporary configuration was sketchy to me because the bike lane was not continuous.
GNV,2odb7s,nauticat,2,Fri Dec 5 23:24:19 2014 UTC,"Add Tower Road to that as well. Fixing roads is expensive though, and it's just not a very high priority for the city or county."
GNV,2odb7s,furryoso,2,Sun Dec 7 22:10:39 2014 UTC,Supporting alternate forms of transportation should definitely be a priority. Getting people out of cars will create less traffic. Adding more lanes just incentivized more people to drive and traffic remains the same.   And cyclists get mad when you suggest they use the sidewalk because it's extremely dangerous. If I can ride at 15-20 mph I should not be on a sidewalk. A sidewalk shouldn't be used at anything above a jogging pace for everyone's safety.
GNV,2odb7s,nauticat,8,Sat Dec 6 00:32:59 2014 UTC,"No. Supporting alternate forms of transportation should not be the priority.  Making Gainesville a ""bicycle first"" community will kill the community. The local population of Gainesville does not financially support the Gainesville community. Gainesville heavily depends on daily commuters from outside the city, outside visitors to the area (football, Gator Nationals, University, etc) as well as commerce activities (trucks, deliveries, more).  Alternative forms of transport work amazing well in heavily urbanized areas. Think New York City, large cities, dense areas (such as the University itself).  Gainesville is not such a city. This is a typical Sprawl community, and by definition is auto-dependent.  The logic of prioritizing Gainesville's bicycle traffic over automobile traffic is flawed in common sense, economics, and the fundamental nature of the community type here in Gainesville."
GNV,2odb7s,furryoso,-1,Sat Dec 6 00:11:12 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry, but making one small stretch of 8th Avenue 2 lanes instead of 4 to accommodate a couple of bike lanes is hardly ""prioritizing Gainesville's bicycle traffic"", especially when there aren't any cross streets and the result is the same at the bottom the hill.   Giving cyclists a bit of a buffer from the cars speeding along that section seems like a completely rational thing to do, and frankly, it doesn't slow any drivers down, contrary to whatever they might perceive.  To be honest, I think they should narrow the entire road out to 43rd street so the bike lanes can meet up with the ones out there. And they should add bus stops, but thanks to people with attitudes like yours, that will never happen."
GNV,2odb7s,nauticat,3,Sat Dec 6 13:38:07 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I disagree.  Additionally, the issue also stems from your belief that ""my attitude"" is the problem, but have no trouble making a jump from a ""small stretch of 8th Avenue"" to narrowing the entire road out to 43rd st.  The way to solving Gainesville's traffic problem isn't by making two lane roads. This area is no longer small enough to support such a system.  Additionally, I understand the need for bicycle and pedestrian safety, but lets remember... more people die in car crashes in Gainesville then bicycles or pedestrians. Making roads two lanes is not the answer.  Gainesville has a traffic problem.  Gainesville was rated high in injuries for pedestrians/bicycles in 2009... highest in the state. That changed and since 2010, the statistic is no longer valid.  Our heavily congested roads and traffic remain."
GNV,2odb7s,JKCIO,1 point,Mon Dec 8 02:58:37 2014 UTC,"More people die in car crashes in Gainesville because too many people are driving. There aren't great options for people who live even a few miles out of town to commute to work.  8th Avenue is perfect example of this. It's not a designed as a major thoroughfare in Gainesville, contrary to what the size of the road road might have you believe. It splits off from Newberry, and I would argue, tries to feed people coming from that area north of the city when it gets to 43rd Street. If you drive on this road at all, you understand exactly what I mean.  The majority of traffic entering road between 43rd and 23rd should be from the neighborhoods along it, and possibly 34th street heading south, as people heading downtown might prefer to avoid 13th street.  People in these neighborhoods are close enough into town to try other commuting options, but surprise, surprise, there really aren't any.  (Note: I'm just speaking from own my experience living along that section of 8th for 25+ years. I'd really love to see actual traffic flow data.)"
GNV,2odb7s,annoyingbeggar,3,Mon Dec 8 13:23:30 2014 UTC,"Nothing in Gainesville is designed as a major thoroughfare -- which is the main problem. This is Sprawl and was never designed or planned properly for our population.  Santa Fe has grown tremendously. So has Tower rd area. And 39th. And the NW. and the SW... and every point of the compass. This was done with no consideration for traffic.  The city has grown more than 100% in size in more than 25 years. Population for the Metropolitan area has more than doubled.  More people means more people driving.  The community we lived in 25 years ago does not exist. Blame whomever you want, but this is the case. The city in the late 90's through today has pushed for expansion and attraction of more people to the area.  Gainesville, and most of Florida for that matter, is a Sprawl community. By definition this community is automobile dependent.  You're not going to change sprawl by making two-lane roads. The community itself cannot survive without automobiles.  To be very blunt, any belief that the change in roads will impact or change sprawl is without merit.  If you want to make change, find another way to do it. The method of narrowing roads makes an enemy out of those whom depend on cars (the overwhelming vast majority).  Find a new method that these people can support, and you'll make a change."

With that said, you may want to speak with my grandfather. As a kid he would have to go live with other families for spurts of a time because his family was too poor to sufficiently take care of him. That start didn't slow him down.   He's a UF Grad, class of '52 who then worked for the City of Gainesville for many years. He also served our country in the Navy. He has likely planted more trees (Oak trees are his favorite) at UF and in Gainesville than anyone else. One story I find particularly interesting is that his team had to plant a bunch of Oak Trees at UF before some of the roads were built. They had to try to guess where the roads were going to be built and plant accordingly. His experiences such as this are too many to count.  Upon retiring from the City of Gainesville he started Shiloh Oaks Tree Nursery in Micanopy where he now lives with his wife of over 60 years, Audrey Liddon. They host the annual Thanksgiving reunion which has blossomed to a total of 92 friends and family this year. One of the Thanksgiving traditions is that we plant a tree in honor of a passed friend or family member. The trees are now adorned by a plaque. I believe the tree planted in 2001 was for the lives lost on 9/11.  At one time Gainesville was called Tree City and I believe Gene Liddon is directly responsible. I always thought one of the coolest things would be to plot every tree he planted at UF or in all of Gainesville! One of his many philanthropic efforts is being currently active with the Easter Seals. He is a role model and leader for everyone that he comes across and would be a great person for you to share with our community.    Thanks for your time.

Now owns thousands of apartments in Gainesville and Tallahassee as owner of The Collier Company (I believe it was formerly Paradigm Properties). Probably the richest guy in town.  Earl Powers: Now deceased, Mr Powers is the main reason the interstate comes through Gainesville instead of going directly to Tampa from Atlanta. EP Powers Park, just east of town, is named for him. He is also one of the founders of the Gainesville Quarterback Club, the oldest Florida booster club in the world.  If you are looking for the surrounding area, Maddox Foundry and Machine Works is a small foundry in Archer, and one of the few independent foundries left in America. It is over 100 years old and manufactured arms in the world wars.   Edit: Who do you write for?"

GNV,2o7gz9,EagleSkyline,4,Thu Dec 4 00:04:38 2014 UTC,"After the $90 PS4 shenanigans, expect Wal-Mart to be by the books. Best Buy will match ads from stores they list in their policy. I haven't had them call to check stock since they put the new policy in place. However, with Newegg and Amazon it has to be in stock and sold by those companies. If it is a Back Friday ad, BB will say no."
GNV,2o7gz9,reddjoey,3,Thu Dec 4 00:52:11 2014 UTC,I picked up Skyrim from Target for $9 because I showed them it was on sale on Amazon. Took about 3 seconds and there was no hassle.
GNV,2o7gz9,risto1116,2,Thu Dec 4 01:42:40 2014 UTC,Best Buy has always done right by me. I've never had an issue getting them to price match and I've even had them match deals like Target's buy 2 get 1 free deals before.
GNV,2o7gz9,VoraciousZephyr,1 point,Thu Dec 4 03:08:28 2014 UTC,"Walmart sucks sour dog ass with price-matches (and inconsistently changes policy).  I've never tried with Best Buy, so YMMV.  Toys R Us has a pretty lax policy (will even price-match amazon but adds shipping costs, even for prime-eligible).  I don't really bother to try to bargain hunt.  I can afford to buy games I want, and I'm already spending a ton on them, so the few extra bucks usually aren't worth the time to hunt around or put off buying.  Wish I could help more... those are the only two where I really have experience."

I honestly buy 90% of my games off of amazon or steam.  Everything else is just an impulse purchase bought from wherever I happen to see it.  Your best bet is probably to lurk on cheapassgamer and then try to get TRU price-matches (which works for most stuff, but not obviously out-of-stock product or most limted releases, which they don't carry)."

GNV,2o5gpu,kristoferen,2,Wed Dec 3 23:49:28 2014 UTC,"Police Chief Linda Stump sent out this additional info   We believe the threat against UF is likely a hoax as well.  However, since safety is always our No. 1 priority, the university has taken additional precautions, including issuing a timely warning this morning and increasing police presence and patrols. Please know that:  The University Police Department and the FBI are investigating.    Patrols and police visibility have been increased on campus.   Anyone who feels they need support may use a variety of resources:  U Matter We Care [umatter@ufl.edu (answered 7 days a week) or 352-392-1261], the Counseling and Wellness Center (352-392-1575, phone answered 24/7), or for those who live in campus housing- their housing staff. Families may contact U Matter with questions or concerns. Employees may use the Employee Assistance Program by calling 352-392-5787 or eaphelp@shcc.ufl.edu.    Classes are not canceled except in cases of significant emergency. Unfortunately, hoaxes are common so reacting in such a vast and negatively impactful way to threats that are determined by law enforcement to be a low risk is not a viable option.    If the safety risk increases in any way, additional action will be taken and additional communication will go out.    Students should follow their regular schedule but ask for assistance if necessary.    Be alert to your surroundings and if something makes you concerned or suspicious, contact University Police at 352-392-1111 or 9-1-1.  See something, say something.    Information about the timely warning is available by calling 1-866-UF FACTS.      As these kinds of threats may arise again in the future, we will continue to work closely with our federal partners to assess and respond appropriately."

It's inevitable.  2) Go to a dog park and ask owners if they'd mind if you can check their dog for fleas.

I'm far removed from booking/promoting events, but you might have better luck reaching out to some of the venue owners that host live acts.  I see you had a few photos at Jack Rabbits, have you reached out to Tim Hall (Jack Rabbits owner)  I'm sure he could use great photos like the ones you've taken to highlight resent shows, or to stir up excitement the next time the same act is playing again & needs to be promoted.  He also does the majority of the bookings at the Freebird Live.  Nice work & good luck!"

EDIT: Oh and unfortunately I don't have any advice for you regarding who to contact.  Honestly jut hit up whoever and they're usually happy to get free photography and it's a fairly effortless process.  Be careful about doing too much free stuff though!  It devalues you as a photographer and hurts the industry as a whole.  I knew a local club photographer who was pretty much only considered ""that guy who shoots for a bar tab"" and promoters only ever contacted him expecting nearly free service.  They contacted me knowing they'd have to pay much more."
GNV,2nrb9r,_pumpkinpies,10,Sat Nov 29 14:27:37 2014 UTC,"You left your bike in a bad part of town, in the same place for several nights. What did you expect? That's enough time for someone to notice it, case it (keep track of whether it's moving), and steal it.   There is no consumer grade lock you'll find that will defeat a hacksaw and time.  My solution has always been to ride a bike that no one would ever bother stealing but in general though a U-lock is sufficient."
GNV,2nrb9r,ice109,5,Sat Nov 29 15:23:29 2014 UTC,"I'm with you. Six bikes in five years isn't surprising if OP is leaving them locked up for very long stretches of time like this, let alone anywhere within walking distance of the Greyhound station."
GNV,2nrb9r,malachi23,1 point,Sat Nov 29 17:26:07 2014 UTC,"This is probably the most careless I've been with location, though I took a chance since I was in a rush and I had two locks (not that it counted for much). Probably about half the bikes I've had stolen have been while I'm at work and they are locked outside, one time for a shift as short as 4 hours. The frequency is more because of me using them at least once a day."
GNV,2nrb9r,gesis,2,Sat Nov 29 18:48:13 2014 UTC,"Sounds like bad locks + leaving them too long to me.  Not all U-Locks are the same, and leaving a bike overnight is asking for it to be stolen.  I commute solely by bike and have only had the misfortune of having one stolen in the time I've lived here (about a decade)... and that was a shitty old unlocked beater stolen out of my fenced back yard.  If you're not going to be within eyeball distance of your bike for more than a few minutes, take it inside.  If it's a short trip for groceries or such, lock it up through the frame with a beefy mini U-Lock (since those have too little room for bottle jacks or pry-bars).  I find that most of the bike racks in town are too thick to get a mini-lock around the wheel+frame, so I go for around the seat-tube + a good cable lock for the wheels (abus, non-walmart-kryptonite)... and I never leave my bike unattended for more than an hour (if the lines are really bad at publix or the like).  At work, my bike goes in the break room."

GNV,2nfap3,inquire_the_truth,5,Wed Nov 26 00:31:04 2014 UTC,It's a planning nightmare. That's one of the main intersections of Gainesville and that publix serves a huge chunk of the student population as well as native Gainesvillians.   They probably don't want to totally lose out on all of that income during reconstruction or remodeling. The Publix on nw 43rd and nw 16th was relatively painless but businesses in the area had to deal with a veritable ghost town for several months. Also served a much smaller population.   I've also heard that the powers that be want Checkers to become the new home of a CVS but there is some alleged push back there.  I don't think there's any need to rush to rebuild.

The only time a Publix isn't the biggest/only large tenant in the plaza is when they bought out a grocery store (like the Albertsons in Butler).

Resumes are good to have if you get called in for an interview, then you would print out a couple copies on nice paper and give them to whoever interviews you.

I was happy when I had them but when I moved to Miami it became a pain in the ass. It also took them nearly a year to close my account. They kept charging me fees because I had taken all of my money out already. $5 fee + $30 overdraft that I had to get cleared up all the time.  With a credit union now and the rates aren't as good but I can bank at basically any other credit union in the country so I never really have an issue with finding a location."
GNV,2n6ziv,carlidew,2,Mon Nov 24 19:51:28 2014 UTC,"Does it have to be in town? I switched from a local bank to Ally Bank last year and love it. They have great interest rates on checking and savings accounts, and there are no fees for having accounts. You can deposit checks using your phone, and you can use any ATM to withdraw money (they reimburse you for the ATM fee each month). Unlike other local banks I've used (Campus USA, for example), their website and phone app are very user-friendly with easy-to-navigate user interfaces. The only downside is you can't deposit cash, since they don't have physical branches, but I've found that this hasn't been an issue for me."
GNV,2n6ziv,waterboysh,1 point,Mon Nov 24 13:45:15 2014 UTC,"I use Ally. I also have an account with a local bank that has free checking. The rare times I need to deposit cash I put it in my local account and just transfer it. I really like Ally. .90% interest on a savings account vs .05% that all the local banks seem to offer... plus, you get interest on checking. I think that rate recently dropped to .2% but that beats the no interested that most banks have on checking."
GNV,2n6ziv,carlidew,2,Tue Nov 25 21:12:18 2014 UTC,"Yes, their checking rate did recently drop. It was .4% for accounts under 15k and then like .9 or something for those 15k and over, but it dropped. :( Still, I love it and the rates are still higher than other banks.

GNV,2n33m2,furryoso,2,Sat Nov 22 17:14:13 2014 UTC,"Hogtown, Florida:       Hogtown was a 19th-century settlement in and around what is now Westside Park in Gainesville, Florida, USA (in the northeast corner of the intersection of NW 8th Avenue and 34th Street) where a historical marker    notes Hogtown's location at that site and is the eponymous outpost of the adjacent Hogtown Creek. Originally a village of Seminoles who raised hogs, the habitation was dubbed ""Hogtown"" by nearby whites who traded with the Seminoles. Indian artifacts were found at Glen Springs, which empties into Hogtown creek.  In 1824, Hogtown's population numbered 14 souls. After the acquisition of Florida by the United States, white settlers began moving into the area. The 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek obliged the Seminoles to move to a reservation in central Florida. Under the terms of the treaty, Chief John Mico received $20 as compensation for the ""improvements"" the Seminoles had made in Hogtown.

GNV,2mz2gi,hyperorality,3,Fri Nov 21 18:16:25 2014 UTC,No issue. I'm just curious how most students deal with disputes. I've had a few of my college aged friends just abandon or break leases without understanding the long term credit or legal damage they may be causing.   So I was wondering where most students (or low income tenants) turn when they are in a bind.   Most of the reasons I've heard for students withholding rent or breaking leases are rarely legitimate even though I sympathize. Property managers in this town can be ruthless when it comes to breaking a lease or abandonment.

And then based on what your priorities are, what sounds good to you, feel free to post back with any specific questions.   what is the best way to search for houses to rent in gainesville as we would prefer a house over an apartment complex.   There is no secret. People here either pretty much use Craigslist, know someone, or luck into a place driving around."
GNV,2mzmpy,carraway,2,Fri Nov 21 20:17:41 2014 UTC,"There are lots of posts for this already.  But in general, you'll want to live east of I-75, west of Waldo Road, north of Williston Rd, and south of 39th St to really be ""in"" the city. Duck Pond is a really nice neighborhood, but, like most downtown areas, it is also pretty close to some less desirable neighborhoods/areas.   The best choices for finding houses to rent is Craigslist or Zillow.   For crime statistics, you can check out Gainesville Police Department's site. Use 121 Gale Lemerand Drive, Gainesville as the address to begin your search from (this is the address of the football stadium, which is about in the center of the area I described above), set the search radius as 5 miles, and choose a date range. When the results pop up, scroll to the bottom and choose to view on Google Maps. This way, you can see what crimes are happening in which areas. Overall, though, GNV is a pretty safe city to live in, compared to others.  Just to get you started, this house is actually for rent on my street.

Cox is the only one with unlimited internet. It's also just as fast as what I'm used to in nyc.   Honestly, I just think that most of the people complaining are just the few, outspoken unlucky ones. Whenever I had a problem with cox, it was always solved right away. That's one great thing I like about them. In nyc, we always had to wait a few days for someone to come by. But it seems like getting customer service is much more convenient with cox. I sound like a salesperson, but I just wanted to put out a perspective that isn't all about how cox sucks. Cox has been good and reliable to me, while AT&T is so expensive you wonder if it's worth even thinking about."
GNV,2mxtsm,gesis,1 point,Sun Nov 23 22:25:55 2014 UTC,"Define ""unlimited"".  I have cox, and I pay for their top-tier in residential service... it has neither unlimited bandwidth, nor speed.  They also want you to use their shitty wifi-router/modem which manages to suck at both.  I have also had AT&T... it was 2x as expensive for lower-speed service.  I've never had a prolonged outage with either provider... and cox has cheaper service-calls."
GNV,2mxtsm,Mayberedditing,1 point,Mon Nov 24 01:08:51 2014 UTC,"I don't have a set amount of megabytes where if I user over said amount, it would result in a fee. AT&T kept pulling that on me and so I decided it was just a waste of time. Why should I have to worry about how much internet I'm using when I'm at home. It's just ridiculous to me."
GNV,2mxtsm,gesis,1 point,Mon Nov 24 01:47:31 2014 UTC,"Then you haven't hit the cap.  When you do, they don't charge more, they just cut it off.  Getting it turned back on is usually as simple as calling them and listening to them chastise you... at least in my experience.  I hit the cap pretty often... and I've tried to pay them to raise it to no avail."
GNV,2mxtsm,heckyesgainesville,2,Mon Nov 24 02:12:42 2014 UTC,They both suck. We switched to At&T and pay for the 12 mbps and it's nowhere near that. I'd see if you can get Cox to lower your rate before you switch.
GNV,2mxtsm,cushtopher,2,Fri Nov 21 02:16:45 2014 UTC,"Almost certainly not going to happen, just from experience. They know that as much as they suck, they're still the only game in town worth a damn."

GNV,2mxtsm,SlendersSuit,1 point,Fri Nov 21 20:47:25 2014 UTC,I had AT&T for about 5 years before I moved to a complex they didn't serve.  In that time I only made one service call for outage because someone disconnected the wires on the outside of the building.  I never got throttled and plan on switching back to them next year.

GNV,2mxtsm,LackofOriginality,0,Fri Nov 21 03:03:12 2014 UTC,"Not unless you move to one of those apartment complexes where you can get sweet, sweet GatorNet. Otherwise, I'd stay with Cox. I'm paying $40 a month for 50 Mbps down/20 Mbps up, which is shit, but way, WAY better than AT&T. The only problems I have are in my room, but that's because it's on the other side of the apartment."

Sakara closed just a bit ago, Farrah's couldn't leave quick enough, Lunch Box, and start seeing more.   The first to close will be the places that highlight local ingredients, fresh food, quality. They'll drop the quickest.  Food prices (cost) is skyrocketing, electrical is through the roof, and Gainesville rent/taxes makes independent food service (bad pun warning) a recipe for disaster.  Chains use a lot of processed food, bought in bulk, at better prices. They also tend to pay a little less, and spend less locally... all which bring their costs way down compared to the independents.  tl/dr: like a local place? patronize them."

GNV,2ml1po,keely11,1 point,Mon Nov 17 22:09:21 2014 UTC,It was mixed. My dogs are 40 and 50 lbs. and I'd say we encountered more dogs that were smaller than were larger than them.
GNV,2mk0va,Ntopper,2,Mon Nov 17 13:07:02 2014 UTC,Reitz Union.    It's been a while since I went to one of the free events but my recollection was that it was a pretty painless process to get in after showing up maybe 30 minutes before the event.  There is a capacity limit in the Grand Ballroom but I don't know what it is off-hand.
GNV,2mk0va,commiecat,2,Mon Nov 17 14:31:29 2014 UTC,"They do ""sell out,"" as in they only have so many wrist bands to give out. I used to work there and we'd advise people to arrive to these events an hour to 30 mins early, and once you get the wrist band you can usually go do whatever you want until the show starts."
GNV,2mk0va,vitresense,1 point,Mon Nov 17 14:42:35 2014 UTC,"So, in this case, does someone need to show up at 9:00 (30 minutes before event) or 8:30 (30 minutes before wristbands start getting handed out)?  Edit: Also, do you just need a student ID to get in? Do they really check it to see if you're still a student? :D"
GNV,2mk0va,carlidew,2,Tue Nov 18 13:48:44 2014 UTC,"I'd guess 30 mins before wristbands are handed out should be ok since the grand has the largest capacity in the building, but if it were me I'd go the hour early (for wristbands) and get dinner or something in the interim, just to be safe. I don't know how highly anticipated this event is.  If they say you need a student ID on the event page they will definitely ask for it, but the majority of the time you only need a student ID for Friday night events."

I would think going public because of a problem they possibly brought in when they moved in could result in a lawsuit.    I know someone who used Orkin when they found bedbegs in their apartment.  Bedbugs were never seen or known about in any other apartment besides theirs, and that was years ago, so somehow they did bring the bugs in on their clothing, suitcases, blankets, furnishings or something.

GNV,2m7lui,furryoso,6,Thu Nov 13 20:58:54 2014 UTC,"Didn't know it was 4 hours. Are they all 4 hours?   First of all, I'm very frugal, and yes, I would sit through a course to save money if it didn't cost me money.  And I wouldn't just be saving $32. I'd also not have to do the whole 3-day waiting period (we're looking to elope before the end of the year for financial reasons before our real wedding next March), which means I wouldn't have to take two days off of work. And it might be kind of cool to learn something new about each other."
GNV,2m7lui,furryoso,6,Thu Nov 13 21:09:27 2014 UTC,"It's a minimum of 4 hours -- some will be longer.  If you make less then $10/hour, then it's a good deal. If not, it's better for you to work 4 extra hours and pay the difference. Either way you lost 4 hours.  As far as the license... it's valid for 60 days. No reason to get it the same day (or within 3 days of getting married).  Any notary can marry you (and cannot charge you more than 20 bucks). If you want to be super frugal, get the license within 60 days of when you want to elope. Find a notary and a witness. Then, do it. If you can't find a notary, PM me. I'll do it."
GNV,2m7lui,furryoso,1 point,Thu Nov 13 23:09:16 2014 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but it's more complicated than that. My fiance works in a different city and it's extremely hard for him to get time off because he's always busy. Plus, it doesn't make sense for him to take two half days (one to get the license, one to get married) due to the cost of gas for him to get to work. Thus, we were going to try to knock it out in one day without the stupid waiting period.   I know the license is valid for 60 days, but the point is that we want to get married right away so that our taxes will show us married for this year. Again, it's complicated. This is mostly about lessening our student loan payments for our income-based repayments for tax year 2014, not about feel-good marriage stuff; that's what our wedding in March is for."

There's less than 60 days until the end of the year. Then go get a notary and get married anywhere in the state. It doesn't have to be in Alachua county.  If he has a notary at work, ask them to do it.  Again, I've offered to notarize it for you as well. (I won't charge you).   It's not my first rodeo, which is why I'm giving you this advice.  That being said, you can also take an online course for $20 - $30 bucks, giving you a net savings of $12.50 - $2.50 or so.

I guess why we were thinking of doing it in the same day is because we would have to get it done at a courthouse (i.e., on a weekday) since we don't know any notaries. We may take you up on that offer (very much appreciated).  Our other thought for doing the course was that it might be interesting. We've been together a while and have gone over everything from babies to conflict resolution, but you can always learn something new. Have you been through the course or know someone who has? Money aside, is there any merit to it?"

I had to file separate from husband because filing jointly meant my loan payments would go up from 100 a month to $400 a month.  They actually changed the law so now you cannot file separately anymore to lower payments.
GNV,2m7lui,arkansah,1 point,Fri Nov 14 16:09:21 2014 UTC,"I was reading this article (see Item #5) yesterday, and it said that if you're filing separately, you can still say your household is ""two"" instead of ""one,"" if you're married filing separately, to help lower your payment. Is this not true anymore?  We are in the same boat. If we file together, his loan payment goes up drastically (and mine would actually lower significantly because it's much less). We want to file separately so that he doesn't have to pay as much. How can they tell you that you can't file separately?"
GNV,2m7lui,arkansah,1 point,Fri Nov 14 16:14:09 2014 UTC,You can file separately but they want to see both returns and will add them together to figure out the payment.    IIRC the law changed a few months ago.  I could be misremembering though.

GNV,2lsc5e,princeakeeem,5,Sun Nov 9 20:19:21 2014 UTC,"34th Street Wall:       The 34th Street Wall is a 1,120-foot-long retaining wall along SW 34th Street in Gainesville, Florida. The wall, which dates back to 1979, was originally built to prevent erosion of a hill on the nearby University of Florida golf course when 34th Street was widened from two lanes to four.  The wall itself is most notable for being covered with layers of graffiti up to as many as 250 layers of paint   thick in some areas. Messages painted on the wall have included marriage proposals, birthday wishes, graduation announcements, celebration of athletic victories, public awareness, promotion, and tributes. In 2006, Musician and Gainesville native Tom Petty returned to the city for a concert and he was welcomed with a message painted on the wall. Petty was presented with a photo of this section of the wall along with the Gainesville key to the city during the visit.  [(http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/digital/collections/wall/) Although most of the graffiti on the wall is done by students at the university and members of the community, there is occasionally ""tagging"" and professional graffiti.  Although technically illegal, neither the Alachua County Sheriff's Office nor the Gainesville Police Department have charged anyone with criminal mischief for painting on the wall. In the past, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to prevent graffiti on the wall, including painting the wall white and the use of graffiti resistant coating, but in more recent years, the wall has been accepted as a Gainesville landmark and is considered a ""community bulletin board"".  When the city last resurfaced 34th Street and widened the bicycle lanes, this originally required removing part of the wall. Instead, officials opted to narrow the road median, leaving the wall intact. Sadie Darnell of the Gainesville Police Department and later the Alachua County Sheriff's Office, maintained the wall, including ensuring the Danny Rolling victims memorial was intact until 2000, when the UF Interfraternity Council took over. In addition, waste containers are provided to allow for proper disposal of used paint supplies.

Second, UF and SFC students ride for free so that eliminates a lot of potential buyers. Even if students didn't ride for free, student passes for the semester are only $60. So selling this to students for more than $175 is going to be almost impossible.   So you need someone who isn't a student to buy this, who can't get a discounted pass from their job or other association, and honestly they need to see that they are getting a deal. I don't know the price of an annual pass since RTS doesn't offer one on their site, but I image it would be less than the monthly rate.

GNV,2lawtx,ladybro,3,Tue Nov 4 22:51:43 2014 UTC,"I'm looking to sublease a room in a 2/2 in Cabana Beach. Its on the third floor and in the newer phase so you get some extra amenities like a vaulted ceiling, flatscreen, and a larger more comfortable couch.   The apartment is in the ""back"" of CB and far enough away from all the pool activity so that you can have some quiet study time on the weekends if you need. The neighbors are also quiet, all of the loud parties happen in the pool buildings. If you want to party you only have to walk maybe a minute to reach the more active buildings.   The apartment, as described by friends who have visited, is nicer than most every other apartment in CB for two reasons. The first being that our view from the living room and a good portion of the patio lets us peer right into the canopies of some neighboring trees. The whole living room has this kind of relaxing-zen-tree-house feel when you open up the blinds. The second reason the apartment is ""nicer"" than others is because its actually clean. No vagrants, or messy freshman have lived here as far as I understand so its well kept for a students apartment. We're you to move in you would find that cleaning the whole apartment takes 45 minutes on your own, and maintaining the place (vacuuming, dusting, kitchentops, etc.) takes 25 minutes. Its perfect if you're in a pinch because of school related obligations.  I've lived here for a year and a half and have had a good experience. I chose to live in Cabana Beach, rather than neighboring complexes, because it had what I needed. I didn't need marble countertops or wood flooring as a college student. What I needed is a full set of working appliances, a warm environment, and a place I feel secure in. Cabana Beach has provided and accommodated all of these needs I have plus I'm not confined to a ridiculously expensive lease I can't actually afford.  The amenities are great! I'll start with the pool, its the largest in Gainesville and during the warmer months its a wonderful haven to escape to after a long day. You can jump in or hang around the edge swaying in the hammocks they have set up. If you're outgoing you'll make friends in no time. The study rooms are also awesome, they're large enough that you can have club meetings right there or you can sprawl your notes all across the tables for when exam week comes bearing its teeth. It has a gym which has some basic equipment, but you'll most likely want to go over the the South West Rec at UF to exercise. The complex sites along the Bus 21 Route, which you can view here http://ufl.transloc.com/, so you can get a ride straight to the Reitz Union from where you're living.  The rent is $505 a month for the 2/2, third floor, vaulted ceiling, phase 2 option, this includes $40 in utilities. I have gone over the covered utilities before, but CB will just post a note on your door letting you know by how much so you can pay it. You would be living with just one roommate, who is a good guy and keeps to himself. The management up at the front office is comprised of college students, just like all the other complexes, and they will occasionally make clerical mistakes or need a moment to get another employee to answer your question. If you're understanding enough, and know that they are not a thesaurus or majoring in finance you will get along with them just fine.  If you're interested in anymore information please PM me.  Best of luck and Go Gators!  cLEVr561"

GNV,2lapc1,cococreek,5,Tue Nov 4 20:45:26 2014 UTC,"I had a coworker do this. His parents bought it for him when he first enrolled at UF, then when he graduated, he rented it out.  He said it was rough. Appliances broke and he had to buy new ones. The tenants were really messy and damaged a lot of stuff. The building also got mold in it, so he dropped serious money to get the whole place cleaned, but the apartment complex paid for some. After the first tenants lived in it, he had trouble renting it and it sat empty for 8 months. He finally got fed up with it and sold it.  That's the saga he endured. I'm sure not all property ownerships are as bad as that, but he talks about it like it was the worst decision. I've always wanted to own income property too, but I feel like students are among the worst people to have as tenants because they typically don't care for things, pay for things, or stay in the same place.  When I last looked in to it, I can tell you this: realtors know exactly what they're doing when they price places. It could be small and dumpy but they'll list it for way over its market value because it's in a college town and they know it can be income property.   Still, there's potential for money to be made. Just remember that this is an investment and like all investments you could take a big loss or a big gain. So make sure you're prepared for both."
GNV,2lapc1,risto1116,2,Wed Nov 5 00:16:04 2014 UTC,"Thank you. That's a great reply.   I understand the risks, and I understand the problem of having students be tenants. It just seems like it could go well, if it goes well. But it could go terribly bad, if it goes bad. And then there are probably a million things I'm not thinking of like fees and insurance and appliances.  I just need to figure out a business/investment idea in the ""near"" future."
GNV,2lapc1,Gatorphan,3,Wed Nov 5 00:43:30 2014 UTC,"We still have a surplus of places for rent in this town. You would need a pretty unique selling proposition to keep renters (esp student renters) loyal and/or generally respecting your property.   In my experience, most students (undergrads) aren't good tenants. They don't really have a strong grasp of that responsibility yet. I know I didn't understand when I was that age.   Now if you are in a target market for graduate level students or young doctors and other professionals, you might do fine. Find something in the northwest maybe instead of getting lost in the sea of southwest side apartment complexes.  Remember that students aren't the only people who live here.   Young professionals and small families can make solid reliable tenants (but that's never a guarantee).  Lastly, do your lease the right way. Maybe that means getting a lawyer. Prepare to evict and sue and maybe not collect for some time. It's a reality of being a property owner in this town.   I wouldn't do it in the current leasing market but best of luck if you do."
GNV,2lapc1,risto1116,2,Wed Nov 5 03:13:43 2014 UTC,"I understand. To tack on to what /u/Gatorphan said, avoiding the undergrads is probably your best bet. There's a ton of options for student housing out there that is cheap, and in the eyes of a student, that's all that matters.   If you want to set yourself out, consider buying further away from campus and update it. Make it higher end and attract young professionals. That's where I am right now- I'm renting a very nice apartment in NW and I couldn't be happier with my landlord.   But again, Gainesville is filled with empty condos and foreclosed properties. You can buy pretty cheap, but be prepared to not make back your investment for a very long time (if ever).  But I assume you're doing your research, so enough from me."
GNV,2lapc1,carlidew,3,Wed Nov 5 05:37:32 2014 UTC,"My realtors advised me that it is a better investment to purchase a house to rent out rather than an apartment. You have to remember that apartments usually come with condo association fees, which you have to pay in addition to property taxes, insurance, and your mortgage. Thus, less money in your pocket from rent after you pay all these other bills.    The fees can also increase every year, and the rental value of your place could go down, meaning you might not end up making that much money after all.  Houses can be picked up for pretty cheap, especially in east Gainesville, where people rent for longer terms than students. This means less turnover and less ""getting it ready for the next tenant"" every year. If you can find a house that just needs some cleaning/paint, you're in great shape. A single-family house also allows you to target more than just students; lots of single families around here choose to rent versus buying."
GNV,2lapc1,carlidew,1 point,Wed Nov 5 16:53:05 2014 UTC,"Thank you. That makes sense. I was thinking about getting a house instead of an apartment because of those fees, exactly. Too much money on that.  I was looking at the south 13th area by the DNA bridge. I don't have much info yet, but that area seems less student heavy."
GNV,2lapc1,Gatorphan,3,Wed Nov 5 18:05:55 2014 UTC,"I'd say it's a good mix. Students do live in the houses there, especially right near the DNA bridge, but further south, like south of 16th Ave, you'll probably find fewer students.  If you have the capital, I would consider a house in NW GNV (south of NW 39th, west of 34th St, and east of the Highway) or Duckpond. With the former, you get great schools in a mostly single-family-homes area that is still close to the city. With the latter, you get the appeal of nearly everyone's favorite area of town (the historic area) where people are ALWAYS looking for rentals, plus being close to downtown (walkable/bikeable appeal), though the older houses there may require more work/updating.   Just like with condo fees, avoid neighborhoods with HOA fees for the same reasons."

It's a 30 minute bike ride, and there aren't any long stretches of bike paths in this city except for the recreational trails. In some states/cities improved bike traffic patterns have been used to cut down on traffic congestion, which is something that Gainesville desperately needs to do.

GNV,2l1pii,waterboysh,8,Sun Nov 2 06:38:58 2014 UTC,Those blue lights that sit atop are to show when the red light is on. It makes it easier way for law enforcement to catch red-light runners.
GNV,2l1pii,wondering_runner,4,Sun Nov 2 06:43:13 2014 UTC,I don't quite understand. How is a blue light different from a red light in that instance?
GNV,2l1pii,wondering_runner,14,Sun Nov 2 07:04:06 2014 UTC,"The blue lights sit on top of the stoplight so that law enforcements can see it from any angle and know that intersection has a red light. That way if someone runs a red light and are caught, they cannot challenge law enforcements by saying ""the police never saw the red light"". This article explains it a little bit more, http://www.nbc-2.com/story/22768557/good-question-what-are-those-blue-lights#.VFXYqMn4KM8"
GNV,2l1pii,Ohhhhhk,3,Sun Nov 2 07:12:21 2014 UTC,"Ah, that makes a little more sense. So if the cop is on the road perpendicular to the road the red light runner is on he can tell if the light is red for the other direction or not.  I see how that could be challenged in court because technically the officer has no ""proof"" that the light was red unless he had a witness that was at an angle to see the car run the red light and see the light was red. I put proof in quotes because you should be able to deduce using logic that if the light the officer sees is green, the light the person ran was red. I'm pretty sure there is a hardware safefail that prevents green from showing from two different directions."
GNV,2l1pii,furryoso,2,Sun Nov 2 07:36:56 2014 UTC,"I got out of a right on red ticket a decade ago. I on 53rd turning south on 441. The light had just switched and I was turning between during the change. Got pulled over for not coming to a complete stop on a red light. Challenged that the intersection has a right green arrow which could have been green at the time.   The officer was unable to see the light from his position. Only that the light on 441 had just turned green. Since he couldn't say for sure that my light was red ticket was waived. If there was a blue light, he would have been certain if my light was green/red."

GNV,2l1pii,sahuxley,1 point,Sun Nov 2 09:14:36 2014 UTC,That still doesn't make sense.  When does an intersection not have a red light?
GNV,2l1pii,stonner8848,1 point,Sun Nov 2 12:43:57 2014 UTC,"Well remeber that there is usually a small delay from when the light turns red for one direction and green for the other.  The blue light comes on as soon as the light turns red, not the other light turning green as its in this delay when most peopls end up running the red light.  The officer can watch for the blue light to come on and anyone entering the intersection after it turns on is at the cop's mercy of being pulled over."
GNV,2l1pii,wondering_runner,1 point,Sun Nov 2 12:52:25 2014 UTC,So the blue light is on when all lights are red?
GNV,2l1pii,wondering_runner,2,Sun Nov 2 13:39:40 2014 UTC,"No, it comes on when there is a red light on that particular signal it sits on top of and stays on while there is a red light."

Hippodrome is a Greek work meaning “horse” “race.” In ancient times, people gathered in hippodromes to watch chariot races. We represent that heritage with a classic, almost iconic, silhouetted image of a gracefully trotting horse. Then we added two extra legs. This six-legged horse, which usually takes a second glance to notice, represents our mission to alter the norm and incite questions and discussion. It also refers to the six founders of our theatre and the six pillars on our building. Our name is purposely obscuring the main body of the horse.
