CharlotteHornets,3e48n6,ReidM15,2,Tue Jul 21 21:53:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately he is very underrated by plenty of people here as well. It's not uncommon to see things like ""this is Kemba's last year to show what he can do or he has to go."" Idiots."

CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,aceboogieville,10,Tue Jul 21 16:08:28 2015 UTC,I want to see Kemba work at playing off the ball. Nic Batum is capable play maker and Al will keep drawing double teams. I'd like to see Kemba spot up or move through screens to free himself up for open looks.
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,ronnoc_the_mighty,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:32 2015 UTC,Yes. This.
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,theriotismagic,7,Tue Jul 21 17:41:54 2015 UTC,I would like to see him score less now that he has more help and room to work with.  Often times he has to force things since there has been such futility on offense.  More assists with better percentages and I will be satisfied.
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,cbtaylor23,6,Tue Jul 21 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"Same, except i'd word it as i'd like to see him shoot less. if he doesnt force as many shots as he's had to in the past and still gets the higher percentage shots, his points numbers should still be similar (but with better FG%). But if his points drop and his assists go up, i'd still be happy"
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,YonderYonder,7,Tue Jul 21 16:57:06 2015 UTC,"I might go as far to say if we don't see further improvements in his off the ball play and overall game, this could be the year we recognize his ceiling.  He's been getting steadily better, and last year was almost great for him, after this year we will probably really know who he is and what he can do.  Up until now we haven't really been able to tell how great he may become due to surrounding limiting factors, in this years new line up I think he's got the opportunity to show us if he can play All-Star level ball or not.  I'd like to see him sustain that great FG % he had before the knee happened, that could help propel him up the rankings.  If he doesn't improve much further we still have a fringe All-Star in him and that's better than half the league.  Also his name always makes me think of the Lion King"
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,net403,5,Tue Jul 21 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"Since Kemba played 62 games last year; 2 of them while he was trying to play through his knee injury, you can easily break his season down into 3 parts. Going to copy and paste something I posted earlier.  Part 1: Early season struggles.  Charlotte's record: 5-15 (note MKG only played 6 of these games)  Kemba's numbers: 14.3 PPG/5.6 APG/3.9 RPG/ 1.5 TOV/ 45% TS/ 40% EFG  Part 2: The return of MKG and Kemba's explosion  Charlotte's record: 10-10 (note MKG played ALL of these games)  Kemba's numbers: 24 PPG/ 5.2 APG/ 3.3 RPG/ 1.9 TOV/ 55% TS/ 50% EFG  Part 3 : Post knee surgery Kemba  Charlotte's record: 5-15 (note MKG only played 9 of these games)  Kemba's numbers: 14.3 PPG/ 4.9 APG/ 3.1 RPG/ 1.5 TOV/ 47% TS/  40% EFG  I'm really hoping for something like the second part, but more likely he will need to score less and distribute more. A 20/6.5 line with 53-57 TS% would be an ideal season IMO."
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,Cubelar,4,Tue Jul 21 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"Less hero ball. It was frustrating to watch last season. I understand that he had to play hero ball, because in crunch time he had really no consistent options. It'll be refreshing to watch him (hopefully) not have to carry the team on his back."
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,theriotismagic,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:01 2015 UTC,I think you're pretty much spot on for his potential stat line. 8 assists would really surprise me though I think he'll probably still hover in the 6 range.
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,richt519,3,Tue Jul 21 18:59:22 2015 UTC,Kemba needs to turn two shots into passes. He is sub par shooter and passer. Stop jacking and set up teammates more. He has some skills but needs to refine them
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,matt1918,4,Tue Jul 21 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"Kemba is not elite and will never be elite. If by elite you mean superstar. Never ever ever ever. He is not that good.   Now during that stretch he had some good runs where his shot was falling but he also had games during that stretch where it wasn't and he was forcing it.   Kemba Walker tries to play ""hero ball"" (which is a term many people in this sub use and have become familiar with watch Kemba play).   So having said that, there is no stat line that would particularly satisfy me with Kemba Walker. Unless somehow his shot dramatically improves.   For me what I want to see is less holding onto the ball and throwing up nonsense while being eventually triple or double teamed.   Spacing could improve this tendency but I don't know.   Kemba is good enough for us to win a ring down the line with, but he needs to destroy the desire or need to carry this team on his back because his is quite frankly not good enough to do that.  We will only win games by playing good team basketball, with everyone sticking to their roles and doing their job. We don't have any superstars and so nobody should be playing like they are one."
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,TheCarolinaPanthers,4,Tue Jul 21 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you but I think his hero ball was mostly a result of he and Al being the only offensive options we had. Even if he wanted to play Rondo levels of facilitating over scoring, we would have scored like 70 ppg last year. There just was no option for him to play an efficient style. This year, we will find out if he's capable of facilitating at the level we need a PG to play at. He'll have a grace period to adjust but if he's still trying to carry the offense at the end of this season, we'll know we're gonna need an upgrade."
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,BobcatsHornets,2,Tue Jul 21 23:46:12 2015 UTC,I agree 100%.
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,TheCarolinaPanthers,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:13:31 2015 UTC,"Nah when I said elite I just meant one of the better players at his position, which I think is obtainable even though the point guard spot in the NBA is loaded right now.   To your other point, I honestly think his days of hero ball will be put behind him next season. It's all still completely unknown, so this is just speculation through my teal colored shades, but I think the moves made by the FO make for a great situation for Kemba to thrive in a more traditional pass-first role as the primary ball handler. For once (hopefully) he'll have reliable, legitimate 3 point threats all around him, as well as other players who can conduct the offense and let him play off ball. The improved spacing and weight lifted off his shoulders should do wonders for him, me thinks.  Lastly, I agree 100% about the team ball thing. I feels like our FO has taken a Hawks-esque approach to building this team, which I can't complain about."
CharlotteHornets,3e32l8,kr0kodil,2,Wed Jul 22 03:24:45 2015 UTC,"We know what Kemba is by now. A guy with great leadership, handles and the ability to create his own shot, but he's not a very good shooter or distributor. Improved spacing could help his FG% marginally, but he'll never average 8+ assists per game or be an efficient scorer. He also struggles on defense and he's not effective at the rim. He can't run the pick and roll effectively. What he can do is create (low percentage) midrange shots with the clock winding down, which is a decent safety valve when Al gets doubled down low.  Best case scenario is that added spacing allows him to reach league-average efficiency on ~17 ppg, and he gets up to around 6.5-7 assists per game. I don't think you can ask for much more than that from him."
CharlotteHornets,3e338e,aljeffersonphd,4,Tue Jul 21 16:13:08 2015 UTC,"If Batum plays well, and resigns, this offseason is a win for me.  Seeing how poor Winslow has shot the ball, makes me feel fine about Kaminsky pick.  I am fine building around Kemba, MKG, Batum, and Kaminsky.  Only other option was tanking and hoping we get a star."
CharlotteHornets,3e338e,cbtaylor23,4,Tue Jul 21 16:40:06 2015 UTC,"Not worried about it. Pundits have given Dave Gettleman shitty draft grades since he got to Carolina, and he's now (arguably) one or two drafts away from fielding a legit Superbowl contender. Different sports, yes, but these 'experts' could shit on a piece of paper and it would have credibility because they work for ESPN."
CharlotteHornets,3e338e,aceboogieville,3,Tue Jul 21 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand the reason the Kaminsky pick is getting trashed in regards to that trade.  It is not just because we picked Kaminsky, it is because we picked Kaminsky when we could have picked Kaminsky and walked away with an extra first.   2 scenarios where that happens.  1. The easy Scenario (less likely)   We take Winslow, and we wait for Boston to take Kaminsky. We get Kaminsky and a butt-load of extra picks.   2. The tougher road. (More likely).   We make the trade. Are sitting at 16, and somebody snags kaminsky before we go. Oh no, what do we do? Well we offer some of our 6 new freaking draft picks for him. Do we end up trading all of them? Maybe, but not likely. We likely trade one of the extra firsts and still end up with extra picks after the Boston trade.  You see, that's why.   Is there some risk involved where they say no? Sure. But you only don't take that risk, and go ahead and grab your guy if your that guy away from making a difference. We are not one player away from making a difference unless that one player is a ROY candidate. Frank will be solid, but he is not the best prospect in this draft class, and while he will probably be a hornet for a long time, and I will route for all the success in the world for the big guy, he was not the most talented prospect while we were sitting at 9.   You can't fall in love with a player, it crushes your ability to build  team. Back when Jerry West was running the Grizz, he had this odd fascination with Mike Miller. That kind of zeroing in on a player isn't a smart way to run a team.   But whatever this guy gave us a bad grade. I don't understand why we get so defensive about it. It's not like we have done anything in the past 10 years of Charlotte basketball. We have to shut these guys up on the court before we can complain about them treating us unfairly."

I wish the guy well, and the reason he couldn't work out here was that he couldn't space the floor and was a ball dominant guard (which didn't pair well with Kemba-our other ball dominant guard).   I think we'll be better than last year because we have fixed our spacing, but for people to believe that we missed the playoffs because of Lance is ridiculous."
CharlotteHornets,3du2hk,TheCarolinaPanthers,4,Sun Jul 19 23:27:34 2015 UTC,"We missed the playoffs because of injuries and a Big Big Al, but I think Lance epitomizes all the reasons we wouldn't have been successful even if we had made the playoffs."
CharlotteHornets,3du2hk,MilleniosIV,8,Mon Jul 20 03:16:04 2015 UTC,"Worst off-season move: Tie: Keeping Brian Roberts and P.J. Hairston.   I could understand that statement if we re-signed him to a NEW contract, or if we didn't get Lin... but Roberts is a 3rd string/depth guy in a position where our starter just had knee surgery. Sure, adding Harrison makes Roberts even less relevant but I'd hardly call keeping him the worst off-season move..."
CharlotteHornets,3du2hk,davidoffbeat,5,Mon Jul 20 12:27:22 2015 UTC,this. it's not like keeping them will make us worse. if anything it provides some insurance in case of injuries or just tired players.

If Seth Curry is good enough to be our 12th or 11th guy, then we would be short-sighted not to sign him.  Why you ask? Why should we be concerned about this? Well, because it would bump up our chances of signing his brother in FA. Even though the bump is likely only a fraction, anything you can do to give us a slightly better chance at doing so is ridiculous.   I'm not saying go out there and get him. But at least give him a look. It's not like the guys at the end of our summer league bench are doing anything anyway."

And sure, it's entirely possible that we contemplated it and went ""nah"". But seeing as a better team than us said ""let's give it a shot"" tells me that we probably didn't. I have yet to see a move (with maybe an exception with Big-Al's signing) that made me go ""that was smart"".   But as far as my definition of bad for business is when you have an opportunity to do something, it costs you nothing, has zero negative impact, could potentially gain positive results, and you sit on your hands."

CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,hornetsrox,8,Fri Jul 17 18:34:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know the specifics of Lin's contract, but if he can opt out after one year, then he'll definitely do it IF he has a good season. That wouldn't necessarily mean that he leaves Charlotte, but it would mean that the Hornets would have to pay him more money.  Edit: he does have a player option in 2016, so he'll definitely opt out if he plays well this year. It wouldn't be too hard to find a team willing to pay him more than $2 mil in that scenario."
CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,schrutebeetfarms,4,Fri Jul 17 18:47:17 2015 UTC,Especially when you factor in the cap increase.
CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,TheFanslator,0,Fri Jul 17 20:06:34 2015 UTC,Lots of people forget about the cap increase
CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,FrankNiggerKaminsky,2,Sat Jul 18 01:57:16 2015 UTC,Good season or not he's opting out.
CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,ArnieJ44,7,Sat Jul 18 02:11:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say 99%. He'd have to play horribly to not opt-out. It's not difficult to be worthy of more than a $2.3 million contract (or whatever the exactly amount is). Lin is betting on himself this season. Hopefully it works out well for everyone.  Staying in Charlotte will probably be a function of his fit beside Kemba plus his ability to drive the 2nd unit, and the salary Jeremy will command in 2016. We saw last season that Kemba doesn't thrive with other guards who are ball-dominant (Lance, Mo), so the verdict is still out until we actually see these guys play.   If Jeremy plays really well and tries to get something greater than, say, $6 million/year, I doubt the Hornets will retain him. But you never know. So much about next season is in flux with the salary cap increasing and the Hornets having so few players under contract beyond this season. Edit: corrected my shitty grammar."
CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,aljeffersonphd,6,Fri Jul 17 19:22:10 2015 UTC,100% if uninjured.
CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,psychonaughties,2,Fri Jul 17 22:03:46 2015 UTC,"Opt out and get paid if he plays well and we're good, opt out and bail if we suck."
CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,Aurion7,2,Fri Jul 17 22:10:36 2015 UTC,"Gotta depend on several variables:   How 2nd unit meshes with him.  How coaches utilizes him &  manage his minutes.  How the offense system is run.  Lastly, all nba players just want to play in a way that make them enjoy the game. So other than the money, they all look for  Starting role opportunity at any team with a great coach. I don't imagine anyone else replacing Kemba anytime in the future. But I also don't see any other team needing a starting PG in the near future that has a non tanking mentality and a decent coach.    I think he values situation > personal performance > money  Regardless of his own personal performance, if everything is going according to his vision of ideal situation he'd very likely to not opt out. It's hard to consider coming off the bench as ideal, but it's going to be better than many other options out there.  If he's playing well, but something just aint right, he might opt out."
CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,supjackjack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:39:31 2015 UTC,Basically 100% barring a catastrophic injury.  Even his worst critics concede he's a passable backup point guard.  That's still worth more than his contract especially with the cap increase.
CharlotteHornets,3dni7o,GOATLin,-3,Sun Jul 19 06:05:05 2015 UTC,Somewhere between 0% and 100%.

CharlotteHornets,3dl2zu,nenozer,6,Fri Jul 17 08:49:29 2015 UTC,"Which to me, Jesus Christ. How did Jeremy only get a deal for $2M a year? And not even as a starter."

CharlotteHornets,3dl2zu,fruchtzergeis,4,Fri Jul 17 23:42:20 2015 UTC,"Well, he made $15m last year so he's probably doing fine for money. But the main thing for him is that he was stuck in shitty situations the past 2 years, playing for coaches who didn't believe in him. Byron Scott said he was too ball-dominant, when he had Kobe holding the ball for 20 seconds before chucking wild shots. What swayed him to Charlotte was Clifford telling him they needed him in order to run the PnR and P&P with Kaminsky and Hawes. He was just looking for a good fit with a coach who wants to utilize his skills, and he said as much on his Facebook page after signing.  Looking forward to watching him run the PnR with Frank in the 2nd unit."

Yeah it's ESPN but still looks good on Lin."
CharlotteHornets,3dl2zu,sanjugo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:34:10 2015 UTC,"I think to Lin, finding the right situation that gives him an opportunity to play his game is far more important than the money, the money will come later and he's already getting paid from endorsements.  Coming to Charlotte may not be a bad idea to start again, dude's still only 26 and he's one of the best team mates any team could want."

CharlotteHornets,3dj65e,richt519,6,Fri Jul 17 14:31:39 2015 UTC,Frankly (no pun intended) I think the ifs were a lot bigger going with Winslow and Vonleh than the ifs we will deal with with our current team.
CharlotteHornets,3dj65e,kr0kodil,3,Thu Jul 16 21:31:45 2015 UTC,"True, but sometimes you gotta swing for the fences instead of playing it safe. Vonleh and Winslow have the athleticism and budding skillset to potentially develop into all-stars. Of course, they may not develop, but they have high ceilings. Batum and Kaminsky are skilled players who will pay immediate dividends, but they'll probably never sniff an all-star game.   As the OP pointed out, playing it safe in a small market won't build a championship contender.   It'll be real tough to watch if Vonleh and/or Winslow develop into perennial all-stars in a few years."
CharlotteHornets,3dj65e,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:13:03 2015 UTC,I agree with you for next season. After that is where I think the Vonleh/Winslow alternate universe had better odds of making us contenders

CharlotteHornets,3dj65e,asiantemp,2,Fri Jul 17 22:02:32 2015 UTC,"Well, in his first (and only) full season as a consistent starter, his Per 36 numbers were 15 pts and 7 asts. Since that was his first season in a system (2012-13 Rockets) and he didn't have much NBA playing experience, it would've been reasonable for those numbers, as well as his overall efficiency, to go up.  He would've been in the lower half of the starting PG pool, but he put up respectable numbers in his only full season as a starter."
CharlotteHornets,3djlzy,ReidM15,5,Thu Jul 16 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"I think this is something a lot of people that are fans of other teams don't understand.  There was NOBODY on our team last year that could do anything close to what Batum did in that game.  Now that is probably a bad thing, but nobody was capable of taking over both sides of the floor when the game was on the line.  You could say that these highlights were products of having an elite line-up surrounding him, but yeah.  People just dismiss this but I've never seen Gerald do anything close to what I saw in those highlights."
CharlotteHornets,3djlzy,Daheixiong,5,Fri Jul 17 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"Blazer fan here.  I've been really excited about Vonleh, but I wanted to let you know you got a really, really good player in Batum.  When motivated, he does everything on the floor, during his worst games he's still a premier glue guy.  He had a down year, but he's only 26 and I expect him to bounce back and be in discussion for a top five small forward.  Just love him, and he'll love you back, and if you feed him lots of good croissants he should stick around for another contract.  Edit:  Insider tip: Nic has this psychic ability to know when his teammate's shot is good before they shot it.  It's always after his passes, but when he makes a pass to a wide open teammate and he knows it's going in, he starts walking down the floor while the shot is in the air.  It's very entertaining, and I know you'll probably think it's just confirmation bias, but I swear he's right 95% of the time."

CharlotteHornets,3djlzy,theriotismagic,3,Fri Jul 17 10:06:57 2015 UTC,"There is no Aldridge caliber guy on our team. I don't think we are going to see as many of the pretty plays. I did have a thought though. If MKG gets that corner three shot he's working on with Bruce Kuetzer, imagine the possibilities. Having two guys who can defend the perimeter (Batum has some great defensive moments in this video) and also be an offensive threat from downtown...that would be a thing of beauty."
CharlotteHornets,3djlzy,theriotismagic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"He is a good player, but he could be great if he had a different mentality. He plays with the mindset of robin instead of batman and it means that he is frustrating to watch night to night as you never know what Batum is going to show up. Once every 10-20 games he can take over for a quarter, but on a night to night basis you always wonder if he is even going to get 10 points. To be honest as a Blazer fan I hate to see him go, because he could be special, but I think if we are rebuilding anyway then I would rather rebuild around someone else then hold onto him hoping he will change."
CharlotteHornets,3dirbz,aceboogieville,6,Thu Jul 16 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"Problems: ""Why go with the best player available or even trade back, when the opportunity to select the ideal prospect for the system was there for the taking?""  ""The Bobcats weren't exactly dynamite on offense during McRoberts' final year in the Queen City""  Neither of these inspire confidence."
CharlotteHornets,3dirbz,Elcor05,7,Thu Jul 16 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"The answer to the first question is that the team is in ""win now"" mode. They weren't looking for a prospect, they wanted someone who could come in and contribute within the confines of the system right away.   To the second part, that's why the FO brought in Batum, Lamb, and Lin. Adding those guys to the equation instantly improves the offense. We weren't 'dynamic' on offense that last year with McBob because, let's be honest, the rest of the roster outside of the core players was mediocre or worse."
CharlotteHornets,3dirbz,ArnieJ44,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:55:24 2015 UTC,"Mediocre is being as generous as you can get. The moves Cho made in Free Agency add not only shooting but young experience as well. Batum, Lamb, Hawes, and even Lin have played on contenders in the West, but were never given a lot of opportunities like their respective teams other stars. It will be very interesting to see how all of these new personalities fit with the current system.   We finally have a deep bench in Char-vegas with a lot of players that have potential. Some might say the Hornets have to many ""project"" players this season to be considered real contenders. However, I think the the new additions to the team have a lot to prove, and if they all have the work ethic the media portrays them to have we may just have the Eastern title brought to Charlotte."
CharlotteHornets,3dirbz,richt519,3,Thu Jul 16 18:57:43 2015 UTC,Come on man I consider myself pretty optimistic about this years team but I see no way we are a contender. I think we'll make the playoffs and maybe even get past a round or two but even making it to the finals is a hell of a stretch. And then we'd have to deal with whatever team the west spits out? No chance. We'd be lucky to win one game against their 1-6 seed.
CharlotteHornets,3dirbz,TheFanslator,4,Thu Jul 16 20:45:23 2015 UTC,"My hopes are that Frank Kaminsky is similar to Pau Gasol and Justise Winslow is similar to Ron Artest (minus the extracurricular activities).

CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,richt519,8,Wed Jul 15 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"I think there is merit to the ""big hand"" style of asset management. There is so much behind the scenes stuff that we aren't (and never will be) privy to though. I was very high on Vonleh and was sad to see the news when we traded him. We have no idea how the dude looked in the training facility and at practices. It may not have been a hard decision to trade him. Who knows. I can't get too upset about the trade, because I don't have realistic sample size of his playing to justify being upset. It's easy to criticize the front office, but we don't have the details they do.  MJ has said he wants to put a winning team on the court. The smart move is to fill a position of need with a player who has proven his worth as a starter.  I agree that we have a solid young core of players that we can build around. At the end of the day, we had very obvious issues to fix and our front office addressed said issues head on. As a fan with little to no insight into what goes on behind the scenes, that's all I can ask for at this point. Some people think the ""win now"" strategy is dumb. Fair enough. As a longtime fan of the franchise(s), I'd rather see our team attempt to be competitive."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,theriotismagic,8,Wed Jul 15 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone wants to see the team tank and lose. But it depends on HOW the team tries to be competitive. For instance, two years ago when Wiggins and Parker were going to be the draft picks, the team decided to win NOW rather than trying to get one of them. There is no guarantee that either of them would have been drafted, but it showed the team wanted to do more than make the 8th seed. However, the team tried to win now, and it seemed to work! Jefferson was a great pick up, we still got Noah with the draft, and the team was on the way up.  Then last year happened. The team still wanted to win NOW. Which obviously didn't work. The one possible good part of the future was Noah, possibly the only player the Horcats have gotten who wasn't a reach since the first Hornets team left. He was hope. And while I am very happy with Batum and am glad we have him, Noah was the biggest hope the team has had in a while. With him gone, there doesn't seem to be a clear path to winning again.  So yes, people want to go for the big hand. But that's because the team has either folded every round or stayed in with crappy hands. You may lose big going for the big hand. But you certainly don't win going for the small one."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,Elcor05,3,Wed Jul 15 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"I've won with a shitty hand before, just sayin lol  But other NBA teams aren't bluffing, your hand might turn out to be better than you think though"
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,net403,2,Wed Jul 15 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"It's a little harder to win with the shitty hand in the NBA than in poker though, for the same reason that YOU can bluff. This team probably needs new starters at at least 2 positions (and I mean Steph Curry or LeBron level) before it would compete. And if that's the eventual goal, the big win is preferred to the shitty hand."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,Elcor05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"Yes we definitely lack a super star, Lebron being an exception, no one saw Steph coming, so you gotta get lucky in the draft.  You can't win big without a super star for sure, but you can make some waves.  We have a functional team for now I'll look forward to the next 2 drafts, and that talent likely won't develop for years.  I'm happy attempting to be competitive for now, hope we can find a diamond in the rough so we don't need a top 3 lotto pick.  At least I can feel like I'm part of the mix if it works out, if not back to the drawing board as usual, but this time we've got more than just sub par pieces, now they are a little more exciting (for now) imo."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,net403,3,Thu Jul 16 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"I don't see why people put so much stock into last season? Our best players all dealt with injuries for large parts of the season. We took a shot on Lance and it backfired so we lost another planned started and ended up with a perfect storm of bench players carrying a lot of minutes. We've dealt with Lance and brought in shooters and passers. So how does it go from ""the team was on the way up"" to ""there doesn't seem to be a clear path to winning again"" when we still have all of our core players and addressed our weaknesses?"
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,Elcor05,2,Wed Jul 15 23:30:26 2015 UTC,"Two years ago the team went from absolutely awful to making the playoffs. Last year, we realized how far away the team was from doing anything substantial. This team is certainly deeper and better than before. But barring every single player on the team playing better the ceiling is still a 4 seed in a weak East. And that's IF everything goes well for us and everything goes bad for everything else.  Also, frankly, the core players aren't that good? They are certainly better than some of the teams in the NBA, but how many would be All-NBA without amazing seasons?"
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,BobcatsHornets,4,Thu Jul 16 01:01:33 2015 UTC,"MKG is the only player on our team i could see starting on a championship team. Maybe Batum if he plays like he did 3 years ago. We committed to the rebuild for two years which is way too short for the strategy to work. We got one good player in MKG and we got Cody who would have to really bust out to make that worthwhile.   My biggest frustration with this franchise is that we can't just stay the course ever. Cho is fine at drafting. MKG is awesome and Cody is ok but that draft was weak so you can't do much better anyway. Then all of a sudden we sign an aging, injury prone, one sided post player who's never been on a contender and then we start trading for short term contracts. The front office has proven capable of signing players that our market shouldn't get but we haven't built the foundation to make it worthwhile. If we keep changing our mind every 3 years about how we are building this team, we will continually be out of contention."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,Elcor05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:57:09 2015 UTC,Making the 4 seed would be great (or even just making it back to the playoffs). You can't just have your sights set on being a contender before you are even a good team. You have to work your way up to it and focus on one step at a time.
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,psychonaughties,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:32:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, you have to walk before you can run. But you also want to make sure that, once you start running, you can get close to a 5 minute mile instead of a 15 minute mile."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,psychonaughties,2,Thu Jul 16 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"Because at best we have the 8th or 9th best roster in the East right now, and we need some people to stay healthy that haven't shown they can to even attempt to get there (MKG, AL). So this ""win now"" strategy isn't going to win much."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,theriotismagic,2,Thu Jul 16 00:31:57 2015 UTC,"I would just love to see us make decent draft picks when we have the opportunity and develop talent. No need to tank necessarily, but I wouldn't mind if they did because at least that makes a kind of sense.   Oh, and can we stop selling 2nd round picks? Teams can find gems there."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:39:04 2015 UTC,"You and I have gone back and forth on this. I don't disagree with the strategy you are advocating. I look at what Minnesota (as an example) is doing right now and see validity to that approach. I guess the only reason I keep throwing out my counterpoint is because you are completely writing off the moves we are making. You would not even accept that ""win now"" is even a strategy. There are so many variables to both strategies that we can't say definitively which will yield more success for us. Either way, the moves are already made. As a fan, what can you do about it though? You have every right to be upset.  Let me ask you this, what is your hope for the 2015 - 2016 season and how does it effect the long term success of the franchise?"
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,net403,5,Thu Jul 16 10:13:20 2015 UTC,I think a lot of the the backlash from the Vonleh trade is that people wanted to make it about him when it wasn't. It was about replacing Hendo with Batum which is a very good move and we had to let go of something to make it happen. It's unfortunate that it had to be Vonleh (I've heard they wouldn't take anyone else) but on the other hand he also didn't really play much so it didn't mess with our rotations or schemes or anything.
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,noyoublow,2,Wed Jul 15 21:07:47 2015 UTC,looking at it that way is just as ridiculous though. The reality is we traded Vonleh AND Henderson for Batum. Doesn't matter who we were trying to upgrade. People make it about Vonleh because he was the more valuable player in that deal. Many people liked Henderson but no one really thought he was better than an average player. Vonleh has looked very skilled every chance I've seen him play. And we chose to gamble his potential for a good but not great player who may only spend one season with us. It makes tons of sense to question the move and it is honestly a huge risk for Cho's job security imo.
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,BobcatsHornets,2,Thu Jul 16 06:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, emphasis on the attempting to be competitive part over pinning our plans on some future hope and dream (took liberty paraphrasing the 2nd part)."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,psychonaughties,7,Wed Jul 15 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"You're right partly. On the other hand, to use another gambling metaphor, one can always play safe and break even or win slightly, but you don't win real money without taking the necessary risks. And however you spin it, the NBA is a superstar league and often you only get a hold on one of those by taking a risk and developing the talent. Drafting and trading safe might make you a perennial play-off team but you'll never truly contend."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,asiantemp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:51:03 2015 UTC,Hawks balled out without any superstars this year. If you're a perennial play-off team you can draw in a superstar or continue to build until you can draw one in. I'm not saying to not go for superstars but just to not focus on them exclusively and sacrifice team needs and good fits to do it. I just think bad teams should worry about becoming a better team before worrying about getting a superstar to come in and be a savior and make everything better.
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,TheCarolinaPanthers,3,Wed Jul 15 23:22:47 2015 UTC,"The Hawks are about as good a team as we've seen that has been built that way. Even then, they had very good players. Milsap and Horford were one of the best frontcourts in the NBA the past few years. They have a borderline all star point guard and a guy who is possibly the best catch and shoot player in NBA history. And even with all that going for them, almost no one took them seriously as contenders because teams don't win titles in the NBA without a superstar. It's just the way the league works. I think it just comes down to whether people are satisfied just being a good team consistently that can make the second round or if you really just want true title contention. Personally, I want a championship."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,ronnoc_the_mighty,5,Thu Jul 16 06:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, look at the Hawks. They've made great draft picks (Horford, Teague). They've gotten some absolute steals in free agency (Millsap, Korver), and they developed some youngsters and has-beens into quality players (Demarre Carroll, the bench mob).   Can you name one Hornets move that is on that level?   Edit: ...And they still got destroyed in the playoffs and had no business competing with the stars in Chicago and Cleveland."
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,TheCarolinaPanthers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:34:57 2015 UTC,Didn't the Hawks have major injury problems?
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,TheCarolinaPanthers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:41:11 2015 UTC,Al Horford is a fringe superstar. He counts. No one on our team is even close to Horford's level.
CharlotteHornets,3df5jd,uncreddevil,2,Fri Jul 17 23:16:28 2015 UTC,"The fans in this sub annoy me because they think the OKC/Sixers model of building through the draft is the only way to go. I think that's more of an exception to the rule. Successful franchises achieve success through a culture of consistency and by finding a nice balance of player development and veteran leadership (Spurs, Pacers, Grizzlies, Atlanta, and Chicago are good examples). That's what is needed in Charlotte. Keep Clifford, trust Cho, and hope that MJ is patient, hands off, and willing to pay to get us to the next level."
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,theinspiration7,3,Wed Jul 15 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"Aaron is gonna make his impact at the next level, and could be a taller Mathew Delevadova this coming season. He bullies smaller guards in the paint, finishes consistently at the rim, and has elite size for a combo guard.  Charlotte needs a d-league team, because Harrison needs the time to develop and wont likely see significant minutes this year."
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,unclefunkjr,4,Thu Jul 16 18:20:09 2015 UTC,"As a diehard UK fan from Lexington, who now lives in Charlotte and loves the Hornets, I think it's a great move.  The kid has size and talent to play the 1 or the 2. He was arguably the better Harrison for most of his two years at Kentucky, but he was essentially a 2-guard that doesn't shoot the 3 very well (unless the game is on the line, then he's money). But he has the skillset to potentially play some PG. A lot of upside in a 6'6"" combo guard who can get to the rim and should grow into a solid defender."
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,scsmith83,5,Wed Jul 15 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"He looked like a man among boys at times during summer league. I'm glad we signed him, he could be a diamond in the rough find."
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,aceboogieville,5,Wed Jul 15 21:54:50 2015 UTC,"He'll probably hate Kaminsky, that's for sure."
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,Whydidideletemyaccou,3,Thu Jul 16 17:33:45 2015 UTC,That was the other Harrison
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,ElVacaDiablo,3,Thu Jul 16 19:07:33 2015 UTC,They both lost though.   I'd hate the guy who took a 40-0 season away from my team.
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,Whydidideletemyaccou,5,Thu Jul 16 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure he'll be fine when he looks at his paycheck."

CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,hornets1994,3,Thu Jul 16 02:51:49 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really help our shooting woes, but the other new acquisitions to the team should make up for that. He's got a lot of potential as a defender and already has shown promise in terms of finishing at the basket."
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,CarlosGrimes,3,Wed Jul 15 21:15:59 2015 UTC,I like the way he was getting to the bucket in the summer league. Solid Gary Neal/Gerald Henderson style player.
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,nenozer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:20:29 2015 UTC,"Good move. Let him develop in D-League. If he shoots higher than 40% FG and 30% 3PT, call him up!"
CharlotteHornets,3dfbfd,Root176400,0,Fri Jul 17 08:44:17 2015 UTC,"I felt as if he had far too much latitude for play calling and decision making at Kentucky, and his failure to facilitate the front court often hurt Kentucky. Kentucky had great bigs.  Aaron has the physical tools to be a great player. Calapari is a great recruiter, but I don't think he's a great in game coach. I believe he did both of the Harrisons a disservice, that they have potential beyond what was shown at Kentucky."

CharlotteHornets,3defjy,floatingbui,11,Wed Jul 15 17:02:40 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the ""Buzz City"" alternate pride jersey rules this out. I'm not totally against the idea though. I think catering an alternate jersey around one player may be a bit much though.   I don't know if there are any league rules about alternate jerseys during the pre-season. If not, they could do some sort of Chinese variant of our jersey for our game there."
CharlotteHornets,3defjy,theriotismagic,5,Wed Jul 15 17:21:07 2015 UTC,Those Buzz City jerseys rule.
CharlotteHornets,3defjy,PhishWayWay,7,Wed Jul 15 18:32:06 2015 UTC,I'm not crazy about the idea of doing a Chinese New Years jersey just because we picked up one Chinese player. Not against it either just don't really care one way or the other.
CharlotteHornets,3defjy,richt519,11,Wed Jul 15 21:11:24 2015 UTC,He's also not Chinese. I mean yes ethnically he is Chinese-American but he was born in California and has lived in America his whole life. Creating a Chinese themed event around him honestly seems inappropriate.
CharlotteHornets,3defjy,G_Thirty,5,Thu Jul 16 00:50:41 2015 UTC,the feeling grows when you notice it's Asian Heritage night  when Lin plays on the road.
CharlotteHornets,3defjy,KingNg,3,Thu Jul 16 02:30:18 2015 UTC,Agreed
CharlotteHornets,3defjy,tarzannnn,3,Thu Jul 16 02:52:26 2015 UTC,ignorance is bliss - do you think he was born in China?
CharlotteHornets,3defjy,richt519,0,Fri Jul 17 03:27:46 2015 UTC,Never gave it much thought. I was referring to his ethnicity though so it doesn't really matter where he was born.
CharlotteHornets,3defjy,supjackjack,4,Fri Jul 17 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think Chinese people like Chinese characters on jerseys. It's the non Asian who like the symbols. Tattoos...

That is like going to an Asian country and all your Asian friends take you to McDonald and say it's American independents day so we gonna get some big Mac, fries, and Coca-Cola!  I'd honestly just stick with Buzz City."

Mostly because the font they used on those Warriors jerseys was just super ugly. I probably wouldn't mind it the characters looked nicer."

CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,Andres_Iniesta,23,Wed Jul 15 14:49:24 2015 UTC,Call me crazy but I'd like to see the team play a regular season game together before we start talking more trades.
CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,TheFanslator,3,Wed Jul 15 14:56:56 2015 UTC,"What is this MADNESS?!  No but seriously, I think the squad we have now, if our shooters can really space that floor we could be looking at one of those middle seeds for sure, and maybe a series win."
CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,TheCarolinaPanthers,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"It's hard to type while wearing a straight jacket.  I agree. I think best case scenario is a Hawks-lite team that wins because of floor spacing, passing, and great team defense."
CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,TheFanslator,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"We've added so many new pieces to the team, the real challenge will be making them all fit together. Great shooters have been added to the roster with Batum, Lin, Kaminsky, hell even Hawes can hit from range.  We finally have a deep roster that can shoot the ball. It might take us a little time to get the chemistry with so many new guys, but I'm excited for the new season.  Buzz on."
CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,ArnieJ44,9,Thu Jul 16 15:20:33 2015 UTC,Hendo trying to create his own shot isn't our problem anymore.
CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,Aurion7,8,Wed Jul 15 15:03:24 2015 UTC,"You have Batum and Jeremy who can create their own shot, and Henderson ain't here no more.   I'm excited for the season to start, I think we have a very solid team which could make some noise during the season."
CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,Dementium84,5,Wed Jul 15 15:58:50 2015 UTC,"Forget trading at this point, we have 1 spot left open and the MLE, so I'm down for anyone we can sign out right. I don't think there's much assets left we could make a positive gain by trading away for what we would get in return. Based on who is probably available, they are probably less valuable than what we'd have to give up, not even sure we could find a positive gain for Hawes at this point.  I'd be ok to leave it as it is and find the last spot for MLE and hope he isn't god awful"
CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,net403,5,Wed Jul 15 15:35:08 2015 UTC,"I would be ecstatic if we acquired TJ, but his biggest strength is his off ball movement and ability to finish at the rim or in traffic."
CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,In_Liberty,2,Wed Jul 15 15:23:18 2015 UTC,I'd love to get him. I was big on him before he was drafted. His best skill is making tough shots that most defenses regularly will give you. That screams scoring potential.
CharlotteHornets,3ddxbu,BobcatsHornets,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:36:44 2015 UTC,Don't get me started. A group of friends at work were so mad for them getting PJ/ Noah last year. We all said TJ would have been great.  Now he is gonna start getting more time and the Hornets will continue to get UNC players.

Napier was a Hornet for like five minutes).  Noah Vonleh was one-and-done at Indiana. You're about...oh, ten years out of date complaining about Charlotte having ""too many"" former Tar Heels.  Also that TJ Warren wouldn't have been a good fit for Charlotte to begin with considering his lack of an outside shot. Maybe pump the brakes a little bit."

CharlotteHornets,3debxn,theriotismagic,9,Wed Jul 15 18:26:21 2015 UTC,Absolutely no chance we get any of those guys. I just listed those names to be a fucker.
CharlotteHornets,3debxn,aceboogieville,2,Wed Jul 15 19:33:46 2015 UTC,Hahaha. I figured as much.
CharlotteHornets,3debxn,theriotismagic,3,Wed Jul 15 20:04:00 2015 UTC,I think the odds of KD coming here are pretty much as close to 0 as you can get. I expect him to either stay with OKC or possibly go to Washington. I would think Bradley Beal will stay in Washington since they have a pretty good situation there particularly if KD goes. If we have a really good year next year there's a chance we could attract Drummond.
CharlotteHornets,3debxn,richt519,2,Wed Jul 15 19:31:43 2015 UTC,I would love it if we landed Drummond.
CharlotteHornets,3debxn,theriotismagic,3,Wed Jul 15 20:05:30 2015 UTC,Al Horford. Trade one big Al for a better one.
CharlotteHornets,3debxn,Elcor05,4,Wed Jul 15 21:30:54 2015 UTC,"Way too early to tell. We haven't seen this squad play once. And there could still end up being another trade before the deadline depending on how the season is going.  I'm looking at that list and I don't see any big names that would really want to come here unless we were really ballin' out. And outside of that I don't know if these new additions are going to really improve our shooting yet or not.   We could be a vastly improved team this year, we could be around the same, or we could be worse. It all just depends, and there's no way that I, or anyone else in my opinion, can justifiably say who we should target in next years FA if anyone at all."

CharlotteHornets,3d9vug,gosuns33,17,Tue Jul 14 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly this guy doesn't see very knowledgable about the Hornets and their thought process in these moves.  He lists Jeff Taylor as competing for minutes when he's no longer on the roster. He says we would have easily afforded Biz's contract, but he doesn't take into consideration the projected cap of 67 when the Biz decision was made, or the fact that we have been planning on using the MLE all summer. MLE + Biz deal under old cap projection = luxury tax. Not so easily affordable now huh?  He mentions a logjam in the frontcourt when discussing Hawes then gives a bad grade for not signing Biz?"
CharlotteHornets,3d9vug,Cubelar,5,Tue Jul 14 19:16:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Most national media coverage isn't always spot on for us. Some of the analysis here is solid though, but some basic research on the writer's part would have helped."
CharlotteHornets,3d9vug,theriotismagic,5,Tue Jul 14 20:01:23 2015 UTC,Yeah plus he said Lin's defense is miserable. Lin was just talking about that on the radio yesterday as a misconception. He's at least okay on that end
CharlotteHornets,3d9vug,aby55,2,Tue Jul 14 21:18:40 2015 UTC,That seems like the one thing every national beat writer states. Its become the justification for why they say he isn't that good.
CharlotteHornets,3d9vug,Dementium84,3,Wed Jul 15 13:35:00 2015 UTC,It makes me pretty mad that we had to make the QO decision on Biz with only a projected cap rather than that actual hard number. How is that right?
CharlotteHornets,3d9vug,skadoosh0019,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"Apologies on the Jeff Taylor part, the draft version of the article published instead of the updated/final version, so I can understand that. But the report about the salary cap being increased to $69 million came out pretty early in the free agency process, and it turned out to be $70 million, so I stand by that.  As for the frontcourt logjam, that referred to the fact that Hawes and Kaminsky bring very similar skills to the table. The Hornets still need a backup defensive big, which Biyombo would have been at a very affordable price.  Thanks for the feedback and for reading!"
CharlotteHornets,3d9vug,Cubelar,3,Tue Jul 14 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"The deadline for making a qualifying offer on restricted agents is June 30.  The report that the salary cap was projected to be 69 was June 30. Biz and all other restricted free agent qualifying offers in the league were made with the 67 million salary cap in mind. The decision to not extend a qualifying offer on Biz was probably made at the NBA Draft, which was june 25th.  The Hornets cap number before the Harrison signing was 75 million, with a Full MLE and matching what Toronto gave him would bring us up to 83.5 million. The current tax number is 84.74M, even now with the cap at 70 million it's awfully close to the luxury tax. Under the old projection it would easily be at the luxury tax. These numbers aren't even including the Harrison signing.   As for Charlotte still needing a backup big, that's a matter of opinion. I don't think they do and Clifford doesn't think they do. He just gave an interview this week where he says he doesn't think 10 man rotations work. In an 8 or 9 man rotation there's only room for two backup big at the most. Kaminsky, Hawes and Marvin, that leaves one big man out already. No room for another big."
CharlotteHornets,3d9vug,Kaendor,4,Tue Jul 14 23:32:15 2015 UTC,"Individually all the moves seem iffy, but together they fit pretty well when you look at the bigger picture and the roster overall.  The only thing that really stings me is that we're stuck with Hawes for years and didn't sign Bismack. If in our C rotation, the backup was still Biyombo (instead of Hawes), I would have felt just as confident about our offense and much more confident about our defense."
CharlotteHornets,3d9vug,Glydedrex,3,Tue Jul 14 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"I wish click-trick sports journalism websites didn't exist.

Whether his action show it is a whole another matter.   If he actually does what he purports to do and that is attacking the rim and have a scorer's mentality without overpassing, he will be awesome here. If not, then same ole story for yet another team. Let's hope that he has finally turned a corner"
CharlotteHornets,3d7dnu,Lorenzomax,5,Tue Jul 14 07:28:15 2015 UTC,"I was surprised though by how confident he was this time, like saying how he's a good one-on-one defender and how he was #1 in blocks in the PG position."

Lin is great at help defense and guarding shooters."
CharlotteHornets,3d7dnu,Miles_Prower1,3,Wed Jul 15 20:46:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of hopeful expectations to get more than we bargained for, but when it comes down to it, his only job here is to be better than Brian Roberts, which is a significantly low bar.  Hopefully this is almost a fail safe, if he ends up deeper on the bench than BRob, its a failure reminiscent of Lance."
CharlotteHornets,3d7dnu,psychonaughties,3,Tue Jul 14 13:41:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. His contract is dirt cheap and he's twice the player Brian Roberts could ever dream of being.

CharlotteHornets,3d7dnu,sanjugo,2,Wed Jul 15 20:41:25 2015 UTC,Hopefully they send Harrison to the D-League for a little seasoning and bring him back at the end of the season
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,psychonaughties,16,Wed Jul 15 07:01:21 2015 UTC,Rick Bonnell said the team denies receiving an offer of 6 draft picks. Ainge could easily be upset that Charlotte refused to trade with him and exaggerated the amount he offered. You'll notice not one person in Charlotte has publicly responded to him.
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,Cubelar,7,Wed Jul 15 09:59:59 2015 UTC,"And really, that trade isn't as good as it sounds.  Those firsts are projected to be mid-late when they're usable, and mid-late 1st round picks aren't as valuable as one solid player.  You're not going to get a Frank Kaminsky-type player after the 15th pick.    This deal would have been insane in the NFL where 1st round picks are as good as gold, but the value of draft picks outside the top 10 often gets overstated in the NBA.  There have only been 3 players drafted outside of the top ten since '59/60 (Wilt's rookie year) to win Rookie of the Year."
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,TubaMike,3,Wed Jul 15 14:06:37 2015 UTC,"The brooklyn pick is incredibly likely to be a top ten pick. That alone plus 16 and 28 would be worth it. Think about it, brooklyn lost deron, lopez is hardly ever healthy, and johnson is getting older and older. We finished 2 games above miami and 1 above the pacers, both who were destroyed by injuries. Detroit was 27-27 without smith this year and was on a tear for the last two weeks. You guys were something like 3-13 without MKG last year and got a bit better this offseason. This means brooklyn should be expected to be 12th in the east, which would be the 7th draft slot. At best the Nets win 38-40 games and get the 8th seed, which would be the 15th pick, but there probably is a better chance of the pick being top 5 than that."

CharlotteHornets,3dct43,bubowskee,-2,Wed Jul 15 23:05:38 2015 UTC,Who said anything about 6 picks? I said multiple first rounders. Which is absolutely what Ainge would have to give up.
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,Aurion7,13,Wed Jul 15 16:03:03 2015 UTC,"Hendo's not a big loss, and you're deliberately lumping the draft in to make it look worse while ignoring the other offseason moves.  Try calming down a bit. I think most people here expect Noah to end up being pretty good, also it's one summer league game."
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,YonderYonder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:25:21 2015 UTC,Hendo is only a loss in the locker room. Batum fits way better than he did on the court.
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,richt519,-6,Wed Jul 15 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"I'll calm down when you can tell me what the strategy is here. Hornets sold Vonleh for a chance at an 8 seed this year. This after years of ""building (ineptly) through the draft."""
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,richt519,3,Wed Jul 15 16:07:39 2015 UTC,The strategy was to greatly improve our starting shooting guard position by throwing in some unproven young talent. Batum is a big upgrade over Hendo particularly at passing and shooting which is what we needed. Kaminsky was picked up to improve shooting because Winslow is a pretty questionable shooter and hopefully to be able to contribute immediately.   Edit:Also if you're so interested in summer league stats why don't you check out Franks because he balled out.
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,theriotismagic,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"That's not a strategy, and improving shooting wasn't the chief reason they got Batum anyway. A strategy is put in place over years. The Batum trade was a knee jerk reaction to the Warriors win (oh, multitooled players with length just won a title, let's run and get one!) instead of a proactive approach to solving a problem they should have solved 3/4 years ago when it was apparent that 3 point shots were valuable.   I'm just going to copy what I wrote to another person who thinks I don't know we're a better team this year than last.   ""I want to be clear: we are clearly a better team this year than last year. We may be a playoff team this year. I think we are no better than the 9th best team right now as Miami is loaded, but injuries or something else could happen. Hell Boston made the playoffs this year. Ask Danny Ainge how he feels about getting swept by Lebron instead of drafting Justice Winslow, what do you think he will say about making the playoffs this year?   My complaint is that in order to put together the 8th or 9th best team in the East, we made dumb decisions that we will regret later on. Kemba/Winslow/MKG/Vonleh might have been the core of an Eastern Conference Finals team in three or four years. Kemba/MKG/Frank will never get there. We still have to find that 3rd star (and pray Kemba learns to run an offense and shoot, and see considerable improvement in MKG's skills).  Let me ask the optimists this: on what do you your optimism? The best predictor of future performance is past performance. Has the prior performance of the FO team given you any reason to think that their moves will work out?"
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,GodWasCreated,2,Thu Jul 16 00:14:54 2015 UTC,My optimism is based on being a fan. It may be naive but I'm not making any decisions for the team so it doesn't really matter whether it's naive or not. Call me crazy but I'd rather be optimistic about the team I'm a fan of instead of always shitting on them. I'm not a scout or a GM so I don't think I'm more qualified than our front office to judge prospects than they are.
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,GodWasCreated,14,Thu Jul 16 13:42:50 2015 UTC,"A) It's Summer League... B) What's done is done. Are we going to have posts every time Vonleh does anything basketball related?  C) We didn't ""basically"" trade Winslow. We also have no concrete evidence that 6 picks were offered from Boston. The draft is also a crap shoot. 6 picks in the NFL draft (where you have a plethora of positions to fill) is one thing, but that many picks in the NBA draft isn't that great of a deal.   As a longtime Charlotte (Hornets-Cats-Hornets2.0) basketball fan, I've had enough heartbreak for 2/3 of my life. The jury is simply not in on Vonleh and there is no need to get worked up just yet. If he has a breakout season, then I'm all for starting a sour grapes thread. Until he actually does anything significant, there is no good that will come from dwelling on this. Nearly every aspect of sports is sensationalized in the media. Do we really need to stoke the flames of negativity here?"
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,GodWasCreated,8,Wed Jul 15 11:25:46 2015 UTC,Couldn't of said it better myself. I for one am really excited for the upcoming season and to see how this new lineup plays together.

CharlotteHornets,3dct43,theriotismagic,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"I'll drop the criticism when there is a consistent, coherent strategy from our FO OR when we get out of the first round of the playoffs. What are you optimistic for? What's your best case this year? What about 2016-2020 - how far do you see the Hornets going?"
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,theriotismagic,3,Wed Jul 15 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"I think the strategy thus far this off season is apparent; beef up the offense anyway possible. We will definitely be implementing more or a pnr strategy with the players we've acquired and it'll be nice to see some strong perimeter shooters on the roster. Best case for this year is getting into the playoffs, I don't expect anything more from our newly renovated team. You have to keep in mind we are still very much a small market franchise so itll be hard to gauge anything for the next few years; I do expect next years off season will be a big one."
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,schrutebeetfarms,3,Wed Jul 15 18:15:07 2015 UTC,I think we will likely make the playoffs. I hope we have a good series regardless of whether we win and I think best case scenario is we get out of the first round and possible the second depending on who we play against. Then we try to improve our team and do better next year.

It is still a terrible offseason, even if you add in flipping Stephenson for Hawes and Lamb. If we were contenders like say, Atlanta, and we flipped Vonleh for Batum, that's a good trade. But this was not a contender. Hornets flipped a young asset (that we had to flip at a discount because player development on this team is a joke) for a one year rental and a chance to get swept by Lebron again. What is the strategy here?   This isn't negativity. No one is going all fatpeoplehate here. No one is calling anyone names. This is simply a reasonable criticism of a failing team.   If you can't have opinions that you don't like on reddit, then you're not going to learn anything new about the world. Or think differently about your own positions and make them stronger."
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,noyoublow,2,Wed Jul 15 16:17:11 2015 UTC,Feel free to share your opinions. I know how reddit works. My suggestion was to reserve a post like this until you have a legitimate reason. I will be just as sour as you are about Vonleh if he turns out to be great. One good summer league game isn't indicative of anything though.   I am curious as to why you think that our player development is a joke? I feel pretty good about the strides both Cody and MKG have made.
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,theriotismagic,0,Wed Jul 15 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"Kemba. Biz. Vonleh. MKG added 10 feet to his jumpshot, but he still doesn't have a handle and makes basic passes."

CharlotteHornets,3dct43,theriotismagic,0,Wed Jul 15 17:11:30 2015 UTC,Zeller has been fine. My problem with him is that he is not Nerlens Noel and he's another reminder of how terrible the FO is. He's a 3rd/4th big man on a good team.

Kaminsky has put up a similar line throughout summer league.    What would be concerning is if your future PF shot 28% from the floor for an entire summer league, which is what Vonleh did last year."
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,TubaMike,5,Wed Jul 15 12:34:25 2015 UTC,"Vonleh also averaged 5.5 fouls per game in last year's summer league.

CharlotteHornets,3dct43,theriotismagic,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:02:16 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but I can't argue with that because it is nonsense. The two things aren't related.
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,theriotismagic,8,Wed Jul 15 23:58:13 2015 UTC,I mean that's the price you gotta pay when you get the best player in a trade.   Also I'm not rooting against Vonleh to make the trade look better for us. I'm glad he's doing well. He gave me a sup nod when I went to the game against the Clippers in LA. We shared a special bond /s

CharlotteHornets,3dct43,net403,-1,Wed Jul 15 08:56:46 2015 UTC,My problem isn't trading Vonleh and Henderson for Batum - it's the Hornets trading Vonleh and Hendo for Batum. Vonleh for Batum would be a great trade for a contender. The Hornets sold out for a chance at an 8 seed. What is the strategy here?
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,arktic_P,4,Wed Jul 15 16:10:57 2015 UTC,"The strategy is to win. Do you really think trading one player isn't going to make a huge difference in the long term? If Vonleh turns out to be the next Chris Bosh, I'll be upset.   He didn't see a lot of playing time for a reason. He came into last season injured. A coach doesn't just hold a rookie player because he doesn't like to play rookies. We weren't in the training facility. We didn't see Vonleh practicing and conditioning throughout the season. The Clifford bashing is based on speculation. The organization saw fit to trade him and they did. Like I've said in other comments, I will be just as upset as you are IF Vonleh turns out to be a great player. Until then, I don't need to look at his summer league stats and piss vinegar."
CharlotteHornets,3dct43,net403,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:08:08 2015 UTC,That is not a strategy.

My argument is that Vonleh was the one pick they have ever made that I wasn't immediately going apeshit about because they passed over another obviously better player. They actually made the right pick that one time. Then they buried him on the bench and flipped him for 50 cents on the dollar."

CharlotteHornets,3dct43,BobcatsHornets,6,Wed Jul 15 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"It made perfect sense to trade Vonleh, though.    Of Zeller, Vonleh, and Kaminksy, Vonleh is obviously the weak link right now.  Kaminksy is clearly the most polished of the group on offense.  Zeller is the most athletic and, although not great, the best defender of the bunch.  Last year, Zeller was obviously more ready to play than Vonleh, as evidenced by Cody winning the starting job over Marvin and Vonleh relegated to the deepest corners of the bench.  Cho obviously likes Kaminsky more than Vonleh, otherwise this trade wouldn't have happened.      In general, I tend to lose faith is drafting ""prospects.""  By ""prospects,"" I mean guys that are physically gifted (great measurables, athletic, etc) but are young and largely unskilled.  GMs, coaches, and fans seem to get wowed by these kids' bodies and their potential that they often (IMO) fail to accurately assess what they actually can do.    Bismack was very much still a project when we drafted him.  If this were the MLB, he could have been stashed away in the minors for years while he learned advanced skills like catching passes.  In the NBA, however, there is no such luxury as the active roster needs to be occupied by players that actually play.       I don't fully understand the hard-on this sub had for Vonleh last year, and why everyone was constantly clamoring for him to get minutes over Marvin (the team's best 3pt shooter last year) or Zeller (who was already much improved from his rookie year and our best defensive option at 4 [excluding guys playing out of position]).  I feel like the outcry would be less if we traded Zeller rather than Vonleh, despite the fact that Zeller seems to be currently better at basketball.  I'm not sure what Vonleh could give us that Kaminsky or Zeller couldn't.    [BTW, Cody Zeller averaged 16.3/9.3 his first year in SL. Cody had 21/13 in his second SL game, but comparing stats in SL games is dumb.  It is Summer League]    We traded one year of Hendo + Vonleh (who was redundant) for one year of Batum.  Batum is an upgrade over Henderson, so we had to throw in Vonleh to make it even.  This was a fair trade.    That's not to say Vonleh will never be a solid pro--he still might be, down the road--but our team is better in the immediate future with Kaminsky than Vonleh."

CharlotteHornets,3d5t27,supjackjack,7,Tue Jul 14 03:38:21 2015 UTC,The only way to explain Jeremy's hair is that Jeremy was electrocuted before this press conference.
CharlotteHornets,3d5t27,paulzors,5,Mon Jul 13 19:49:12 2015 UTC,i hope he keeps it
CharlotteHornets,3d5t27,Sir_Gunner,4,Mon Jul 13 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"The first 4:30 of that was riveting, Jeremy looks like he joined an 70's punk band, is that a Sid Vicious do?"

CharlotteHornets,3d5t27,butterknifebrain,7,Tue Jul 14 02:02:04 2015 UTC,"I'm actually kind of shocked that Charlotte was the only team to make an offer to him. Not sure what it says about the state of the league. You can argue that he isn't really that good but I find it hard to believe that teams like PHI or CHI didn't even make an offer of 3M to him, which he is definitely more than worth it."
CharlotteHornets,3d5t27,Dementium84,4,Tue Jul 14 08:05:57 2015 UTC,So he kinda gives away that Charlotte was the only team to offer him anything during the moratorium.
CharlotteHornets,3d5t27,midrangechange,7,Mon Jul 13 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"The buzz the week before was that Lin's best offers came from the Mavs and the Bulls. With all the rumors about the Mavs and Lin trying to work out a sign-and-trade with the Lakers, I'm guessing the Bulls went ahead and signed Brooks instead. The problem for Lin was that the Mavs had no assets that the Lakers would want and vis versa.  That coupled with DeAndre backing out probably made the Mavs abandon the plan and go a different direction. Leaving Lin out of luck, and without any leverage for negotiating."
CharlotteHornets,3d5t27,Scarlatina,9,Tue Jul 14 06:56:52 2015 UTC,"I think after his experiences with Woodson, McHale and especially Byron Scott he just wants a coach that believes in what he can do."
CharlotteHornets,3d5t27,Dementium84,6,Tue Jul 14 07:39:44 2015 UTC,he probably thought the Mavs were a lock and ignored every other teams inquires and by the time shit went south w/ DJ going back...all those teams previously interested filled those roster spots...to be honest I think the Sixers or Knicks would've took him in a heartbeat for 6-8M/yr but who knows...
CharlotteHornets,3d6b69,abeLJosh,12,Mon Jul 13 21:28:42 2015 UTC,Is that Primoz Brezec?
CharlotteHornets,3d6b69,schrutebeetfarms,8,Mon Jul 13 21:44:05 2015 UTC,"Dude, that's clearly Jeremy Lin."
CharlotteHornets,3d6b69,DoughyJoey85,3,Tue Jul 14 01:24:24 2015 UTC,I almost bought an inaugural season orange Brezec jersey for pickup basketball because my mates were hating on me for following the Bobcats so much. Opportunity lost.
CharlotteHornets,3d6b69,praise_the_hankypank,4,Tue Jul 14 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"I LOL'd at ""Bobcat legend"". PRIMOZ!"
CharlotteHornets,3d6b69,scsmith83,2,Wed Jul 15 20:42:21 2015 UTC,I had completely forgotten what he looked like.
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,paulzors,15,Mon Jul 13 19:56:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this. There is cautious optimism (I'm in that crowd), but certainly a sense of realism associated with the optimism. We know it's gonna be a fight to the playoffs but things just went so badly for us last year that making the playoffs seems like a fitting way to bounce back"
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,uncreddevil,7,Mon Jul 13 20:23:00 2015 UTC,"Pragmatic is where you want to be, just try to find the logic in each move.  I think everything they've done is justifiable, but I felt the same way last summer.  Just keep an open mind and try to enjoy the little things, makes being a fan easier."
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,handgredave,5,Mon Jul 13 21:36:02 2015 UTC,"While it is nice that the angry mob has dispersed, I still want to reach the playoffs damn it.  I hope this squad can make it happen."
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,asher1611,4,Mon Jul 13 21:00:54 2015 UTC,I'll drink to this.
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,theriotismagic,4,Mon Jul 13 20:52:18 2015 UTC,All the doom and gloom that's been going around. I think we're in an ok spot. Not perfect. But we've got some talent and flexibility. That's all you can ask for in today's game.
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,Sdt6023,4,Mon Jul 13 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"Talent, flexibility, an attractive roster for free agents, all of that. Ive really felt like the moves made this offseason have been setting up bigger moves in 2016 and beyond. Seems like the FO is preparing for the summer of Curry in 2017."
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,aceboogieville,3,Tue Jul 14 00:39:39 2015 UTC,The rest of the league is really sleeping on us. It's like they've forgotten we were in the playoffs 2 years ago. It's ok though we're the underdogs and it'll be motivation for the players.
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,Cubelar,3,Tue Jul 14 03:06:54 2015 UTC,"I really see no reason we shouldn't be able to make the playoffs so long as we stay healthy. If we didn't have so many injuries last season we probably would have made it. That was a bigger part of us being so bad last year than Lance was. All of our young players have another year of experience, improvement and familiarity with each other under their belt."
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,richt519,2,Mon Jul 13 22:01:26 2015 UTC,Get that 8 seed
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,WumboJumbo,4,Tue Jul 14 12:26:27 2015 UTC,I'm optimistic that the hornets have a playoff team this year.  Beyond this year?  It doesn't look too good.  This isn't a team that can compete for any type of championship without a huge oveehaul.   I feel like this offseason put us even further away from that since management is playing for their jobs.
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,Slapdash13,3,Mon Jul 13 23:50:40 2015 UTC,"Beyond this year? It doesn't look too good. This isn't a team that can compete for any type of championship without a huge oveehaul.   Fortunately we have a complete overhaul scheduled for next off season. As of next season the only people that are definitely on the books are Lin, Kemba, Kaminsky and Hawes. And we have team options on PJ and Cody.  That's the best part of what we've done this off season, we have a run at the playoffs, the skeleton of a reasonable team for next year, and plenty of cap space to fill it out with. The only downside is due to the cap rising there'll be plenty of other teams with cap space too."
CharlotteHornets,3d5y1y,buzzbuz,3,Tue Jul 14 00:40:04 2015 UTC,Lin has a player option
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,ReidM15,13,Mon Jul 13 23:42:20 2015 UTC,I for one am excited to finally be able to play 2k with a decent team
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,Willarent17,12,Tue Jul 14 02:19:29 2015 UTC,"im looking forward to having a few players that can shoot the rock, and our bench unit"
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,dr-doc-phd,8,Tue Jul 14 00:26:48 2015 UTC,"What do I enjoy about the Hornets so far:   Coach Clifford seems very intelligent. I read and heard a bit about him being a basketball junkie. So far it seems like he's a great coach.  Media and fans in general just seem nicer & more polite over all than most other Cities This team looks like a true underdog team that might suprprise alot of people. It has a lot of over-looked / under-valued talents. With good teamwork and chemistry, I think they can do some serious damage. I've always loved the Hornets logo since a child. Glad the organization brought it back and made it look so awesome! And I am happy that some people like my version of the design as well :) best of all Lin is finally in a situation he chooses and seems very content here."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,supjackjack,14,Tue Jul 14 04:26:04 2015 UTC,"Lin and Batum are by far my favorite acquisitions. Both can play multiple positions, both can handle the ball and pass well. In Batum we get another stud wing defender and in Lin we get another point guard that excels in the pick and roll. If Clifford is able to stagger minutes correctly I think this could be a really deep team."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,turnertornado,10,Tue Jul 14 00:39:34 2015 UTC,Yes. I am so stoked for Batum. He provides so much for us that we didn't have last year. We'll have a great passer to make up for Kemba. As well as someone on the starting lineup that can shoot the three.   Then having Lin and Lamb on the bench will make our bench actually usable. I'm so stoked.
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,Halcomb_FeiniX,5,Tue Jul 14 01:11:59 2015 UTC,Im ready to see the defensive possibilities with both Batum and MKG on the floor.
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,theriotismagic,5,Tue Jul 14 02:46:52 2015 UTC,"What are you most excited about this upcoming season?   O F F E N S E. Last season was downright cringe worthy at times. I'm glad they addressed that head on. I was one of those homers who was really bummed to see McBob go. We got some new guys who are McBob-esq. We also got some of the shooting we lost when Tolliver and CDR left the building. I feel like this year's team looks more like an improved version of the 2013-2014 team. That gives me a lot of hope. Perimeter defense. We only had 1 solid perimiter defender (for new fans, I'm referring to MKG). When he was out, we had no one. We got torched by any team capable of shooting a three. It was painful to watch. Batum and MKG will be a problem for those teams.   What have your favorite offseason moves been so far?   Flipping Lance/Hendo/Noah for Batum/Hawes/Lamb. Cho seems to get a lot of flack, but he does a great job getting talented guys in the door (especially considering we are a small market team). We now have guys whose skill sets aren't as one dimensional (Well, jury seems to be in on Hawes defensively...). The moves this off season have impressed me more than last summer."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,net403,3,Tue Jul 14 11:53:08 2015 UTC,"I second that on offense.  After fucking years of hearing the statement ""defense wins championships"" I'm saying not in the NBA it doesn't, if you regularly can't score 90 points D is not enough.  This looks a lot better on paper than last years moves."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,theriotismagic,2,Tue Jul 14 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, and yes.  There were so many games where we built a nice lead in the 3rd quarter, only to completely blow it in the 4th due to a lack of offense. There were several games where we needed to score in crunch time and had no real threats to rely on (leading to Kemba playing hero ball to no avail). It was incredibly frustrating to watch a team that could only complete in 2 or 3 quarters of a game."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,net403,3,Tue Jul 14 14:45:22 2015 UTC,"To answer the ""defense wins championships"" people, I was glad to finally verify the Hornet's stat:  Top 10 in Defense + Bottom 10 in Offense = Bottom 10 in Standings!  I'd settle for average on both fronts before that"
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,richt519,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking I am a ""defense wins championships"" guy. Defense is one of those things that you don't need the most talented guys to do well. If you have a good defensive system and get everyone to buy into it you can have an excellent team defense. Look at what the Cavs did in this finals. I know it's not the greatest example because they lost but given the talent they were up against it probably should have been a lot worse. Golden State was the best offensive team in the league and and a bunch of back ups really shook them up by slowing down the pace of play and playing tough scrappy team defense.  You obviously need scoring but I think defense is a better foundation to build a team on and something that is easier to implement if you're trying to turn a team around. I'm glad we improved our offense but I don't want to lose our identity as a tough, slow-paced, defensive minded team either."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,net403,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:12:32 2015 UTC,"I don't want to lose our defensive identity either, for sure.  But when I hear that statement, it sounds a lot like offense doesn't really matter as long as defense is there, which definitely isn't  the case if you cannot regularly score 90 points. I don't think we have lost any defensive identity so far, but we seem less like we are neglecting the offense entirely and hoping the defense saves our asses in the 4th quarter when everyone is tired of defending and we couldn't put up hardly any points.  I like that it seems they have paid attention to the offense this time around lol  You are right defense is a good foundation but not the whole show"
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,Aurion7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:35:33 2015 UTC,"""defense wins championships""   Friendly reminder that the Warriors and Cavs were both very good defensive teams and that practically no sieves make it deep these days (in the Cavs' case, it took acquiring Shump and Mozgov).  Defense absolutely does win championships, the problem was that our roster was built to compete in 1995. You gotta have at least serviceable shooting- even Memphis isn't incompetent from distance."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,net403,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"Defense can help you win championships, but you also have to score more points than the opponent.  No doubt D is integral but it can't replace the existence of some level of offensive functionality.  The only way the Hornets were going to win last year on defense alone is if they held almost every opponent to below 85 points, which is almost impossible.  Top 10 in Defense plus Bottom 10 in Offense equaled Bottom 10 in Standings.  Just saying in the NBA you can have the best D in the league, but if your offense is completely impotent you probably won't get far."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,richt519,4,Wed Jul 15 17:51:12 2015 UTC,Batum was a great pick up for sure. I'm hoping that MKG will come back with an improved jumpshot and finally have solid enough offensive game to emerge as a truly elite small forward. I like everything I've seen from Frank so I think he'll have a good chance to play his way into more getting more minutes as the season goes on. JLin seems like he's bringing a good attitude and will hopefully will be able to breath a little life into our second string because we have some pretty good young talent.
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,theriotismagic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:37:39 2015 UTC,"He definitely fixed his shooting mechanics and jumper last season. He's been working on his three point shot this summer. If he makes the same strides he made last summer, he'll be well on his way to beast status."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,LIKE_A_BOSS1,6,Tue Jul 14 16:15:26 2015 UTC,I'm just pumped to see no one defending Lance anymore. He was an atrocious failure.   There is no getting around it. No 'he could have developed more next year.' No more complaining about Lance hate (which was well deserved). NO MORE!
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,theriotismagic,4,Tue Jul 14 03:48:29 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of us (myself included) were a little foolish to think that a starting five with Kemba, Al, and Lance would be good. I mean, bringing him in to fix ball movement was not the most thought out move. I was excited for Lance, but realized it was more of a novelty factor. This seemed to be an MJ move. He flew out to Vegas to sign him in a club at 5am or something stupid to that effect. Jordan said he brought in Lance, because the only way to win in the Eastern Finals is to take on/compete with LeBron. We saw how well that worked out when the Cavs blew us out by 40 points...  He was fun to watch with the Pacers, but they aren't my team and his antics didn't really weigh on me at the end of the day. The guy was not a starter. He signed a big deal and expected to be a star here. This was just not a good move on paper. A good many of us thought he would take the next leap into being a starter. I am bummed to see that he's actually working hard this summer to improve himself. All I saw from the guy last summer was a bad rap video and pictures of him in strip clubs wearing throwback Hornets apparel."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,net403,4,Tue Jul 14 11:57:39 2015 UTC,"Nope, there's more.  I like Lance and him not working out here was not his fault, it just wasn't the environment he was going to succeed in as being ""the man"" with no one else around him to make plays, that is basically the reason, it's as much our fault as his.  Lance is a decent player in his spots, anything less is just untrue and unfair, but it probably makes you feel good to say! You're probably glad I chimed in :)  AKA: I'm just as disappointed as you he didn't play well here but I'm not projecting that as hate and blame toward the player, anymore than we should project that on JLin for his time in LA.  Lin could easily become the player that replaces Lance in your comment as well."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,Aurion7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"I like Lance and him not working out here was not his fault   No, it was pretty much his fault.   He never had the chance to succeed on the scale he did in Indiana, but quite literally everything else that happened was Lance being a knucklehead. Sorry. It's one thing if your shot isn't falling, it's a whole nother thing entirely to be fucking dogging it."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,net403,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"Yea his shooting, his fault, the weak fit in the defense his fault.  His need to be surrounded by other play makers was something that existed before he even came here.  And our lack of play makers is no secret.  He couldn't bring PG13 with him, so in hind sight it makes sense why he didn't play well here.  I think it's a bit far when people color him as a shit head that was out to be as bad as he could be lol  Not that you are saying that specifically but it sounds like the general theme of a lot of lance hate.  He was undeniably good in Indy and he didn't intentionally fail here, he just couldn't live up to the demands we saddled him up with because he doesn't possess the skill set that was required."
CharlotteHornets,3d6sw2,deadflow3r,3,Wed Jul 15 17:42:48 2015 UTC,I got my season tickets. Can't wait to see what this team can do. I love the Lin trade and I'm not so sour on Frank as most are. Most of all I just want to get out there and support my team!
CharlotteHornets,3d5o8q,Astone1996,7,Mon Jul 13 18:48:48 2015 UTC,Good luck keeping all the players happy with that minute distribution. The players never buy in iggy style
CharlotteHornets,3d5o8q,1234Squad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:54:02 2015 UTC,I have gotten to the All Star Weekend. Washington has only lost 1 game so far and Charlotte is 9 games behind currently. Patterson is out for the season with an injury. Charlotte is on a 4 game skid and has lost 5 out of 6. Kemba Walker is the only All Star for the Hornets.
CharlotteHornets,3d5o8q,lancestephensoniskil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:34:13 2015 UTC,"I always trade Al Jefferson, and Zeller for Noel (unrealistic, but so is yours),  then let MKG, and Vonleh develop, alongside Noel, whilst unloading any guys on >1 year contracts who aren't part of my core. I proceed to overpay for depth for the duration of rookie contracts, usually picking up at least one title (Untapped Potential for MKG). Beyond that, it's raining rings since the whole squad like 90 overall.  I wish real NBA was as easy, or we'd keep some guys we draft to find out."

CharlotteHornets,3d3y4l,Toposimus,14,Mon Jul 13 09:31:03 2015 UTC,Porzingis just turned 19.  Kaminsky is 22.
CharlotteHornets,3d3y4l,imeanYOLOright,13,Mon Jul 13 10:44:04 2015 UTC,"Porzingod is much younger and therefore has more upside and room for improvement. He's also much longer than Frank, IIRC his wingspan is absurdly long."

CharlotteHornets,3d3y4l,peacebuster,11,Mon Jul 13 12:29:15 2015 UTC,It's not even close. I believe Porzingis will be a superstar.

CharlotteHornets,3d2ezr,uncreddevil,9,Sun Jul 12 23:53:45 2015 UTC,"I think Cody will be the starter. He's arguably our best post defender (shudders) and already knows the offensive and defensive schemes. This likely means Frank and Hawes will spend a lot of time on the floor together as the backups, which you could look at two ways: one way is, with Lin also on the floor, the P&P possibilities are endless. Scoring shouldn't be a problem for this second unit especially because the guards/wings that are likely to also be in the game (Lamb, Daniels, PJ) will be capable scorers, too. The second way of looking at it is, dear god our rim is going to get scored on more than a fat sorority girl. All jokes aside, as I'm aware both Frank and Al are at least competent defenders, although not elite by any means, our second unit will likely give up a lot of points in the paint. We'll have to rely heavily on their scoring output to not blow away any leads the starters build. Best case scenario is our backup wings can replicate a defensive prowess similar to our starting lineup's. Fortunately, there's good reason to be optimistic about that, IMO, as PJ looked much improved defensively in SL and Jeremy Lamb has the tools to be an elite perimeter defender."

CharlotteHornets,3d2ezr,Scarlatina,6,Mon Jul 13 02:50:59 2015 UTC,I'm not sure about Hawes but Kaminsky was an effective PnR player in college.
CharlotteHornets,3d2ezr,aceboogieville,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:00:11 2015 UTC,"I remember in a post game last season, Mo Williams saying he liked being on the floor with Zeller because of his PnR game"
CharlotteHornets,3d2ezr,TenaciousHornet,3,Mon Jul 13 11:37:03 2015 UTC,It will be Zeller. I agree we should probably a ditch bench stretch big like Hawes or Marvin for a more traditional rim protector but they will still come off the bench. Zeller has shown he is a capable defender and I think he deserves to start.  Edit: Any replacement for Zeller would have to be able to play beside Big Al (because he can't play the 4 at all) and Cody is definitely the most capable person on our team for that position.
CharlotteHornets,3d2ezr,richt519,4,Mon Jul 13 00:12:46 2015 UTC,Zeller will be starting for most of the season. I'd like to see some type of trade of Marvin to be able to open up PT for Kaminsky as well as dump his contract. By the end of the season/start of next season we could see Kaminsky starting if his post moves and 3pt shooting translates well.
CharlotteHornets,3d2ezr,ReidM15,3,Mon Jul 13 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"If it's not Zeller, it's Frank.  And I'd be really surprised if it wasn't Zeller at least to start the season."
CharlotteHornets,3d2ezr,asher1611,2,Mon Jul 13 01:54:55 2015 UTC,I think the real question is when will Cliff give MKG and Zeller real minutes?  You can't have your best player and a top 4 pick playing less than 30 minutes a game.
CharlotteHornets,3d2ezr,TheCarolinaPanthers,3,Mon Jul 13 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with that.  The one thing that I truly dislike about Clifford is that he just doesn't allow the young guys to run and play like the players know they can.  Kemba and Al are good, but the team needs to focus more on MKG and Zeller (aka 2 of the best athletes on the team)."
CharlotteHornets,3d2ezr,Macaway,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"I hope this upcoming season Clifford just relies on young players like MKG and Zeller to make more pure athletic plays while they can.

CharlotteHornets,3d0wz9,theriotismagic,8,Sun Jul 12 16:25:50 2015 UTC,Our D won't suffer much anyway. We lost 16 minutes of rim protection a game and that's about it. We added Batum who is a good defender and Frank will probably be as good on D as Marvin was. Plus MKG just covers all their asses anyway. This combined with our offense likely being significantly better means we should be a much better team this year.
CharlotteHornets,3d0wz9,BobcatsHornets,4,Sun Jul 12 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"One of last year's biggest criticisms was that the Hornets were a team built to compete 20 years ago. In today's game, if you build a team for the 90s, that's probably the range of points you're going to score.  The front office saw what attributes to winning basketball (players that can play multiple positions, defend the perimeter, pass, and shoot) and adapted."

CharlotteHornets,3cz63o,zdnorman,19,Sun Jul 12 02:46:59 2015 UTC,"Great! He's certainly earned it.  He'll probably spend some/most of this season in the D-League to develop the skills necessary to play PG, but he's shown potential.  He's not a great (or even good) shooter, but thrived in the PnR, especially when driving and finishing at the rim.    Impact for the team:   1 roster spot remains open Charlotte still has their MLE to use (~$5.46M)   By all indications, they will likely use this to sign an extra wing  Right now, Harrison is the 4th PG or 6th wing - depending on his immediate position.  He likely won't play often (or at all) this season."

Dorell Wright, Marcus Thornton, JR Smith, Jason Richardson, Tayshaun Prince, Rasual Butler, Jason Terry, Chris Douglas-Roberts (?), Chris Copeland (RFA), Luigi Datome (RFA), KJ McDaniels (RFA)  (Kind of wings) Josh Smith, Luc Mbah a Moute, Michael Beasley"

CharlotteHornets,3cz63o,imeanYOLOright,2,Sun Jul 12 12:41:32 2015 UTC,Imo there's just the one version of jr. And can that version benefit the team in some way? Were severely lacking attack.
CharlotteHornets,3cz63o,HURCN_hugo,2,Sun Jul 12 12:47:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his style of play is surely something that could benefit the team.  I mean, we're currently trusting our SG position to someone who's never technically played there before (Batum) and our wing bench spots to some combination of three - albeit talented - wildly inexperienced players (Daniels, Lamb, Hairston). While I think it'll work out (especially in regards to Batum), it's never a bad thing to have more backup options."

CharlotteHornets,3cz63o,BobcatsHornets,6,Sun Jul 12 02:48:17 2015 UTC,I expect him to mostly be in the d league (which will be better for Aaron). This is a good signing taking a flyer on a promising young guy
CharlotteHornets,3cz63o,handgredave,5,Sun Jul 12 02:50:20 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm glad we were the ones to give him the chance though. Only way I see him spending much time on the the actual roster is if there are some injuries or we make a mid-season trade and he continues to look solid in the d-league.
CharlotteHornets,3cz63o,Harrypotter34,4,Sun Jul 12 02:53:19 2015 UTC,I missed summer league but everyone seemed enamored with this guy.  Anyone care to run down his strengths and weaknesses?
CharlotteHornets,3cz63o,mrfixit420,7,Sun Jul 12 02:52:03 2015 UTC,"Simple breakdown: not a great shooter, this is probably where he needs most work. Solid finisher, and good at picking up fouls when driving. Not quite a good defender yet, but has solid size and quickness to be able to potentially guard PGs, SGs, or SFs if needed."
CharlotteHornets,3cz63o,mmaaffee,2,Sun Jul 12 02:57:57 2015 UTC,Everyone likes him because he was successful in college as well.

CharlotteHornets,3czk95,nippedinthebud,9,Sun Jul 12 05:19:55 2015 UTC,Yeah Lin has a large fan base in in the U.S. because of the crazy all-american underdog storyline that fueled Linsanity. People who weren't even into basketball started watching his games. They'll keep an eye out for him for the rest of his career and whenever the media start talking about him they'll be back even if they don't follow anything else in the league.  Seems like the 2nd unit might be shaping up to be the run n' gun style Lin can thrive in with some pick and rolls and perimeter shooting. Daniels was looking like he was gonna be a 3-point specialist in Houston so he might go off this season.

CharlotteHornets,3czk95,net403,0,Sun Jul 12 16:51:20 2015 UTC,"Well to get the ball rolling, Lin is at least a top 10 PG in the league, he's just hasn't found the right situation to be successful. Case in point, Rondo and DWill WERE great PGs too but seemed to have declined even faster than Lin's opportunities.  I don't think Lin is perfect either, but he does have a certain way to play the game and I think it's the right way to play (an attacking perimeter player who looks for the cutter constantly with excellent vision for lob passes and PnRs).  That said, I have no idea about Kemba Walker's game. He's been in the league a while and we don't really hear so much about him. On the other hand, John Wall has improved every year and Lin has been his equal."
CharlotteHornets,3czk95,sanjugo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"OK I love the guy but he is not a top 10 PG. Kemba's not either though, I could see the two potentially switching places mid season if Lin starts producing like a starter. Either way he'll have plenty of opportunity to play with the first unit as a 2 or 1 when Kemba's resting.   Excited to see some PnR play with talented bigs like Al and MKG"
CharlotteHornets,3czk95,Ravid32,2,Sun Jul 12 21:34:48 2015 UTC,"""Top 10 PG"" thank you for correcting him I rolled my eyes on that one haha  He's a secret top 10 PG he's just waiting for the moment to strike. Kemba is usually ranked somewhere around 12 - 15th best starting PG in the league and I am comfortable with that, call it ""fringe all-star"", top 10 would infer to me they have an all-star appearance coming, which I certainly hope is true for Lin some day in the next 5 years but realistically probably not.  The most exciting thing about the off season is the potential of all the unknown factors, all the talk is that this could be a system that works for Lin and I'm very hopeful to see that come to fruition.   Welcome to the forum I hope you form an interest in following our team for a long time!"
CharlotteHornets,3czk95,supjackjack,2,Mon Jul 13 03:04:22 2015 UTC,"Like I said, he is at least top 10 because we know he is CAPABLE of getting there if he's in the right situation.  He's had too many big games to be called a fluke, and if I had to pick a player from the Spurs to play on Lin I wouldn't even pick Parker, Mills or formerly Joseph.  I would pick Leonard, the Spurs best defender. I'm a Spurs fan BTW.  Lin's relegation to the bench in Houston and LA was not because he's a perennial bench player, but because the benches were too weak and they needed someone adaptable enough to switch between starter and bench to lead either group depending on who they were facing.  LA was a joke, so let's not go there but Lin did play well at New York and he/Parsons/Harden were killing it in the first year in Houston (beating the same Golden States team without Andre twice that season).  Lin simply went through a ""glue guy"" phrase which he really needs to get himself out off for people to see his value as a starter."

CharlotteHornets,3czn23,Aurion7,8,Sun Jul 12 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"In with the new:  JLin   Strengths: Excellent driver with good handle, strong p&r play and instincts. Linsanity happened in the context of D'Antoni's spread p&r scheme which was the perfect marriage of player and system.  Weaknesses: Ever seen Kendall Marshall play? That's Lin's D on a bad night, he just can't get side-to-side quickly. Can struggle at times with turnovers. Not real good from the midrange.   Aaron Harrison   Strengths: Length, slashing attacks from the perimeter. Can be almost Sessions-esque in freguency of rim attacks.  Weaknesses: Not a good shooter despite rep for clutchness. Low 30s in college. Shot selection issues from range as well.   Nicolas Batum   Strengths: Length, versatility. Jack-of-trades guy.  Weaknesses: Master of none. Good at lots of things, not great at any one particular thing.   Jeremy Lamb   Strengths: Extreme length for 6'5, offensive versatility. Sneakily explosive player.  Weaknesses: Bulk, strength, defensive play. Skillset is there, but didn't get significantly better over time in OKC.   Frank Kaminsky   Strengths: Playmaking, shooting (outside), has a sneaky dribble attack.  Weaknesses: Athleticism, defensive mobility, length.   Spencer Hawes   Strengths: Shooting (outside and midrange), passing.  Weaknesses: Defense. Chases blocks and gets out of position, but scares precisely no one as a rim protector.   The guys we know well:  Kemba Walker   Strengths: Turnover averse (great A:T ratio despite one of his weaknesses).  Weaknesses: Shooting range, rim finishing, will never be a great facilitator.   Brian Roberts   Strengths: Excellent FT shooter.  Weaknesses: Poor shot selection, lack of playmaking. Despite rep as a shooter, 3P% has declined every year (38-36-32). Medicore/poor defender.   PJ Hairston   Strengths: Legitimate size to play either wing spot, actually decently solid defensively. Good FT shooter. Pretty decent rebounder.  Weaknesses: Extremely streaky shooter, poor shot selection, no facilitation.   Troy Daniels   Strengths: Shooting, hyper-efficient scoring profile (Beyond the arc and at the rim).  Weaknesses: Facilitation, size.   Michael Kidd-Gilchrist   Strengths: Excellent perimeter defender with the size and athleticism to switch freely 1-4 if needed. Good shot blocker when given the chance. Excellent rebounder. Quite possibly only trailing Kawhi when it comes to SF defense since Lebron has been taking more and more plays off on defense the last few years to conserve energy.  Weaknesses: Shooting range, facilitation. FT shooting can be shaky.   Marvin Williams   Strengths: Jack-of-trades guy.  Weaknesses: Not particularly good at any one thing. Merely a decent shooter, especially for a ""stretch"" 4. Poor defender in the post. Lack of quickness relative to 3s, lack of strength relative to 4s.   Al Jefferson   Strengths: Elite post offense- best arsenal in the league.  Weaknesses: Defensive mobility and athleticism- essentially stationary on defense. Not a great rebounder by any stretch. Middling big-man FT shooting.   Cody Zeller   Strengths: Athleticism. Defense, particularly solid p&r coverage.  Weaknesses: Shooting, foul-prone. Turnover-prone."

CharlotteHornets,3cxb0a,arktic_P,11,Sat Jul 11 16:33:21 2015 UTC,I think Cody is going to start. Kemba - Batum - MKG - Cody - AL.
CharlotteHornets,3cxb0a,schrutebeetfarms,8,Sat Jul 11 17:12:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you're right about Cody starting. I just wish Kaminsky or Hawes would start, we need the spacing for Kemba/MKG/Al."
CharlotteHornets,3cxb0a,jaynay1,5,Sat Jul 11 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"Cody's midrange is good enough that he gives you a bit of space.  Most of the spacing problems are in the 1, 3, and 5, and those problems won't go away until next summer."
CharlotteHornets,3cxb0a,ampman_1789,6,Sat Jul 11 17:42:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of defenses are giving up mid range looks now, they are the lowest percentage shot. I'd expect Cody's defender to leave him open for mid range often, maybe just close out at the last second, so it wouldn't help the spacing. Against many defenses 3 point shooting is the only way to space the floor. Well, unless you shoot a very good percentage from mid, which Cody doesn't really."
CharlotteHornets,3cxb0a,matt1918,3,Sat Jul 11 19:00:04 2015 UTC,No way. We need Cody's defense and Frank is just a rookie. Frank and Big Al front court would really take our defense to shit. Hawes can't gaurd 4s so he should only play the 5
CharlotteHornets,3cxb0a,ampman_1789,-1,Sun Jul 12 03:23:59 2015 UTC,"I think Clifford said Cody would be shooting 3s next season. The shots he was taking last year were often not far off, so I expect him to shoot maybe the league average from there. Good enough of a threat to guard him out there if he does."
CharlotteHornets,3cxb0a,jaynay1,10,Sat Jul 11 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"Even more than just having the wrong Zeller, Cody is supposedly the planned starter."

CharlotteHornets,3cxb0a,Glydedrex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:42:53 2015 UTC,Hawes playing beside big Al would be awful on defense. Steve Clifford typically doesn't give rookies big minutes let alone start them.

CharlotteHornets,3cvu0m,skadoosh0019,2,Sat Jul 11 05:02:44 2015 UTC,That crossover to split the defenders and go straight up the middle for the dunk was sweet! His ball-handling seems to get better with each passing game.
CharlotteHornets,3cvu0m,Aurion7,2,Sat Jul 11 05:06:14 2015 UTC,I'd rather see him get minutes in the D-League than sit on the end of our bench.  But I think he played well enough over SL to make the front office think hard about giving him a spot.
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,imeanYOLOright,14,Fri Jul 10 21:40:52 2015 UTC,"I think Aaron Harrison's earned a roster spot.  He still needs significant time (likely in the D-League) to develop the skills necessary to play PG, but he has potential."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,schrutebeetfarms,6,Fri Jul 10 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure he ends up making the team, but I hope he does."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,TubaMike,2,Fri Jul 10 22:26:33 2015 UTC,Same here.  I think he's at least played his way to a shot at training camp.
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,uncreddevil,4,Sat Jul 11 05:18:54 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. I wasn't his big fan when he was in college but he's learning a lot and big enough to play the 2. That being said we should be logical about current SG/SF Free agents. We will see what Cho does though.

CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,Daheixiong,10,Sat Jul 11 02:24:31 2015 UTC,"Frank, once again settled in with a nice 19.  The big thing is that someone needs to tell him how to work the PnR.  He sometimes just expects to set the screen, and then BLAMO, he's open for a 3.  The good thing for him is that he has a solid pump fake."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,JMMSpartan91,5,Fri Jul 10 21:46:39 2015 UTC,Is Frank starting to look like a solid contributor for this season? I know most fans were upset with pick.   I like basketball but am a pretty shitty evaluator of individual players. Football is the sport I know for that depth.
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,TubaMike,3,Sat Jul 11 00:33:44 2015 UTC,"People talk about players with ""high ceilings,"" well Frank has a ""high floor.""  His four years in college gave him a lot of time to refine his game and become more ""NBA-Ready"" than a lot of the other 1st round picks that left early.  Rick Bonnell said earlier this week that Frank's offensive game is already better than Zeller's and Kaminsky will have a real shot to start this season if he improves his defense.  The problem so much isn't who Frank is, rather than who he isn't.  If Winslow was already off the board when we picked, fans would have been much more positive of the Kaminsky pick.  Because of our abundance of rangey big men (Zeller, Marvin, Hawes), it appeared that Winslow would be the obvious choice to fill a void at backup SF.  Cho thought otherwise.    Whereas Zeller and Vonleh were drafted more as ""projects,"" Kaminsky's game is at a level where he should be able to come in and contribute, so long as he isn't too much of a liability on D."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,Slapdash13,3,Sat Jul 11 05:26:07 2015 UTC,"Frank is pretty much guaranteed to be a solid contributor.  He isn't, however, likely at all to be a star player.  A star player is what Charlotte really lacks right now.  That is why people didn't like the Frank pick."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,nenozer,3,Sat Jul 11 02:16:09 2015 UTC,So what pick would have been likely to be a star player?
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,zacka77ack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:05:12 2015 UTC,Winslow.
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,aceboogieville,3,Sat Jul 11 11:00:39 2015 UTC,"Which is still a stretch. We have no idea how he will turn out. Everything at this point in time is speculation and nothing more. The FO went with the safer pick, one that went along with their vision for this team, and I don't blame them for that."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,richt519,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:25:37 2015 UTC,I hate the idea that you have to have a star to win. It's just not true. People act like the only way to turn a team around is to sit around twiddling you thumbs waiting for a star player to come around. If you have a system and players that fit well together you can win.   Edit: Don't get me wrong having a star is a way to win and a very good one but it's just unrealistic to always go all out trying to get stars because it's so difficult to tell whether they will bust or not. Especially when they will be surrounded by a mediocre team if the FO didn't bother to get solid role players.
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,Slapdash13,5,Sat Jul 11 14:24:33 2015 UTC,"If you define winning as making the playoffs, I agree you don't need a star.  If you define winning as having a shot to win a championship, you definitely do need a star.    However, I am happy that Charlotte isn't tanking.  They aren't sitting around waiting on a star.  They are trying to put together a squad that can compete in the East.   People are just not happy because, along with trying to be competitve, a player that many think has star potential was sitting there at 9.  Charlotte passed on him.  He went to a divisional rival.  If he realizes that potential, Charlotte will be paying the price for a long time."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,richt519,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:44:00 2015 UTC,Yeah but it's all about taking steps in the right direction. If you aren't making the playoffs that's what you need to be focusing on not winning a championship. I guess it's all about how you see Winslow. I think he's a little overrated and the risk just wasn't worth it but you never know. We already have young players with potential we don't need any more of that we need production.
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,sovietsrule,3,Sat Jul 11 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe he'll learn some PnR from Lin, that'd be nice"
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,BuzzCityUSA,3,Sat Jul 11 12:28:18 2015 UTC,Didn't get a chance to watch the game but it's nice to see PJ kind of get into rhythm even if it was on 5-15 shooting.
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,ReidM15,5,Fri Jul 10 21:59:40 2015 UTC,"He played well to start, then kind of fell off in the second half. Some of his misses were dumb though. He had like 2 wide open threes that he missed. And an easy lay in the basket that he missed."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,HURCN_hugo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:02:18 2015 UTC,Anything in particular cause him to start missing? Also how'd the steals go down
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,zacka77ack,2,Sat Jul 11 02:21:38 2015 UTC,Well he's fat.  That may have something to do with it.
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,HURCN_hugo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:07:02 2015 UTC,Nah. He just husky
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,ReidM15,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:17:09 2015 UTC,"I think he started rushing a little too much, which is a common problem for him. He's even said it. He needs to slow himself down when he gets the ball. Practically every time he catches and shoots, he misses. But if he can just catch and concentrate for just a second or two, it's a lot more likely to go in. That's why he improved the last two games. He realized he was rushing himself."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,aceboogieville,5,Sat Jul 11 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"Solid games all around. I really liked what I saw from PJ and how he was able to create offense without scoring. He's made major improvements in that category this offseason. Frank looked good today too, but I think it's obvious he really needs to bulk up. He's gonna get pushed around a lot until that happens. However he did seem to be getting more comfortable handling the rock. A couple times after pulling down some defensive rebound he started the break himself instead of passing it off. That's a luxury we haven't had in a while and will make Frank a big mismatch in the future."
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,ReidM15,3,Fri Jul 10 22:06:58 2015 UTC,His rebounding and passing was great to see. It's a huge improvement from last season. He's not just catching the ball and shooting anymore.
CharlotteHornets,3cugfs,net403,2,Fri Jul 10 22:09:54 2015 UTC,"Dang forgot it was on, anyone got an idea when the replay airs somewhere like NBAtv?  Man I'm a nerd looking for summer league replays"
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,ryswag123,15,Fri Jul 10 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"Lance probably works best with the ball, and surrounded by good play makers, of which we have few here, and our few good players only work with the ball in their hands as well, which is a conflict of interest.  Also possibly the absence of any real veteran leadership to help guide and mold young guys like Lance, back in Indy he had Paul George, Roy Hibbert, David West, plenty of experienced guys to man the helm in the locker room.  Ultimately I don't think we have the ability to give him the style of play that works to his best talents, which I was very disappointed about because I loved watching Lance play in Indy.  That's my best rough overall assessment of it anyway."
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,net403,5,Fri Jul 10 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you've written. I would also add that I think he was a tad overrated coming into that free agency period. He's really only had one good half of one season in his entire career and he's a stat chaser (e.g., he would routinely rob his teammates' rebounds so he could get triple doubles).   The facts that the Pacers didn't fight that hard to keep him and that his teammates weren't too upset to see him leave were both very telling."
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,TheFanslator,3,Fri Jul 10 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"very true, still I think he has a shot to be good in la"
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,Cubelar,4,Fri Jul 10 22:24:23 2015 UTC,"that makes a lot of sense sadly, I also really liked lance in indy. the hornets never seem to get it right, its really quite the shame"
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,Cubelar,4,Fri Jul 10 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what people have said. I would also like to add that he was too turnover prone. The one thing Clifford hates on offense is turnovers, he would pull Lance for dumb turnovers and Lance just never could get in rhythm because of that + nagging hip injury. Lance is the type of player who needs to play through turnovers, Clifford is not the type of coach to allow that. I'm not going to blame Cliff but it just wasn't a good fit   Here's a quote by Lance himself late in the season   ""I feel like the Pacers' system, I could play freely and I could be myself. Here, it's like I got a little button on me, like, 'Dang! Don't do that,'"" Stephenson said. ""I've just got to be able to play free and play relaxed and play through mistakes."""
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,Titanstheory,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:47:17 2015 UTC,that makes sense
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,Dhalphir,2,Fri Jul 10 22:48:27 2015 UTC,"One thing I liked about Lance is that he always tried hard, you can't accuse him of dogging it. One thing I didn't like was his negative body language, especially late in the season when he was really struggling.  There's also a rumor that Lance called out Al for being fat and lazy. I remember seeing a tweet about it from a writer. No idea if it's true but if it is you have to think it contributed to him getting traded"
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,net403,3,Fri Jul 10 22:55:02 2015 UTC,"well that would see logical, I got to say I really thought lance could turn things around for the hornets"
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,Elcor05,3,Fri Jul 10 22:57:58 2015 UTC,I doubt it even the hornets think al is fat and lazy
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,unclefunkjr,3,Sat Jul 11 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"But Al is fat and lazy, so there's that."
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,net403,2,Sat Jul 11 10:24:30 2015 UTC,"He isn't wrong, but bad etiquette, I feel like maybe the lack of more veteran leadership may have had a bit to do with that, but there were also rumors of him having a similar attitude in Indy.  If he really carries himself that way, we are better off, but I want to think there is more to it than that, I think because of his court attitude I'm compelled to like him(after the BS), but may be also why people don't like him."
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,Aurion7,4,Sat Jul 11 02:43:18 2015 UTC,"Injuries at the beginning of the season stopped him from playing his best or getting as much PT. Killed his confidence, and then he just wasn't a good fit with players like Kemba and Al."
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:55:55 2015 UTC,"that sucks, hornets really could use a player like lance from the pacers"
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,TubaMike,4,Fri Jul 10 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"Floor spacing, injuries, and team chemistry really hurt Lance's chance of being effective in Charlotte. When he was on the court, with Kemba, MKG, Williams, and Al, any opposing defense could just pack the paint. Lance couldn't provide any consistent 3 point shooting so teams could easily double team Kemba or Al, without a serious threat of giving up a good three point look. Hell, Marvin Williams may have been the best 3 point shooter for the Hornets, which is a bad sign for any offense. Lance succeeded in Indiana in large measure because he was an afterthought for any opposing defense. You had to stop PG, you had to respect Hill, West was a beast and believe it or not Roy Hibbert was an all-star, so Lance found himself with wide open opportunities and he capitalized. On Charlotte, he was more or less considered the 3rd option and teams learned that he couldn't shoot, and that was that."
CharlotteHornets,3cudok,Willarent17,4,Fri Jul 10 22:25:16 2015 UTC,"I really couldn't understand how his defense became so bla·sé (thanks Google).  He had none of the intensity he showed against Lebron in the ear-blowing series, a lot of times looked lost on the floor, like he didn't understand the system"
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,leshric,9,Fri Jul 10 13:52:45 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I don't think we're done in the trade market yet precisely because our big man situation doesn't make any sense. Big Al doesn't fit in what appears to be the direction of our new overall offensive scheme (P&R and P&P heavy), and of course as we've all bemoaned we don't have a rim protector. And Cho said after the Lamb and Batum trades that we weren't done yet. I don't think Cho is an idiot and I think his wild ride has one last loop to hit, just seems like the right deal hasn't been hit on yet. I'm not sure who we would trade with but the more moves we make the less sense this team makes with Big Al as a centerpiece.  Anyways, all that said. Offensively we're going to look VERY different this upcoming season. Lots of shooters to open up the floor. I think we're going to be bombing from deep, lots of P&R and P&P action. I think you're going to see our wings diving to the basket for weakside backdoor lobs off of action up top a decent amount, should result in some nice highlights. (MKG, Batum being the primary beneficiaries)   Defensively, Clifford has said we're going to ramp up the intensity a little and try to force some more turnovers. I expect this will mainly be done on the perimeter by the SG and PG, while MKG plays the free safety and covers any mistakes made by their scrambling, while the interior defenders remain home and clog the lane. As per usual, we'll be willing to give up the corner 3 ball in this scheme if they can beat the pressure. You'll notice we're now a pretty long and rangy team (besides Kemba). I don't think that's an accident, its instant extra defensive pressure via length that we didn't have before.   I don't expect Clifford to change his offensive rebounding scheme. We won't do it much.  EDIT: For whatever its worth, my money is on a deal with either the Jazz or Bulls involved, though we may have to bring in another team to make it work. I suspect the Bulls will be open to trading Taj Gibson now that they have Pau Gasol, Bobby Portis, and Nikola Mirotic to hold down the fort. The Jazz have a ton of plus defenders down low but not much in the way of offense. So those two teams are where I'm placing my chips.  EDIT 2: I could also see the Pacers being involved. $15.5 million trade exception and no legitimate big men on the roster outside of Myles Turner (rookie) and Jordan Hill (is Jordan Hill). Although Larry Bird has been talking of trying to play up-tempo, which if they're serious pretty much rules out Big Al."
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,skadoosh0019,6,Fri Jul 10 14:50:00 2015 UTC,Hornets tried to move Al but no one wants him. I think we're stuck with him this year
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,Cubelar,3,Fri Jul 10 15:24:59 2015 UTC,I'll take one Taj Gibson please
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,isj1984,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:05:37 2015 UTC,Who do you have that Chicago wants for Taj? Pau and Mirotic aren't replacing him...
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,AnalSlutFrog,6,Fri Jul 10 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"Considering it's unlikely we move Al, finding a way to synergize his skill (dude's a magician in the post) with the influx of p&r/p&p guys will be vital.  I think Al might win back some fan support because we actually have some shooting people might have to pay attention to now, which may well cut down on the amount of hard doubles he has to deal with in the post. Especially important in that Hawes and Kaminsky can actually force their men away from the rim/post. Last year people pretty much just said ""we aren't gonna let Al score easily. whatchu gonna do, brother?"" and we had no answer.  Also just in general, having people to pass to who're capable of actually hitting shots will probably be a pretty strong incentive for Kemba and Al to avoid trying to do too much themselves."
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,Aurion7,2,Fri Jul 10 16:38:52 2015 UTC,It seems last year like he was incapable of passing out of the double team and part of that being due to not sending anyone his way as a release valve. Or him being stubborn and refusing to give it to them.
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,HURCN_hugo,3,Sat Jul 11 02:23:59 2015 UTC,"To start us off, I know that on the offensive side we will be running the pick and roll. How are the roll men?  Does the team run set plays or more of a fluid run and gun style system."
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,1234Squad,5,Fri Jul 10 13:56:05 2015 UTC,Def not run and gun. More of a crawl. Al refuses to pnr. Frank likes to pnp. Zeller liked to pnr and doesn't really shoot decisively although he's pretty good at nid range. Idk much about hawes. Marvin thinks he can shoot 3s but cant.
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,1234Squad,2,Fri Jul 10 14:07:51 2015 UTC,Why does ai not run pick and rolls?  Do you guys think there will be a more fast paced atmosphere compared to last year?  I keep reading about how offense was a weakness previously.
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,skadoosh0019,3,Fri Jul 10 14:17:49 2015 UTC,He's fat and lazy. Just wants the ball down low. Probably more fast paced with the second unit with al out and kaminsky hawes and Zeller
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,Elcor05,2,Fri Jul 10 14:25:00 2015 UTC,That's disappointing to hear. How did kemba get his shots last year?
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,Cubelar,7,Fri Jul 10 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"Iso. Kemba is so quick he can pretty much always take his man 1 on 1 and create enough space to get his shot off. It won't necessarily be a good shot, but he can get it off."
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,aby55,6,Fri Jul 10 15:02:33 2015 UTC,"By holding onto the ball a lot.   Realistically though, I don't know enough about basketball/didn't have time to answer that. I feel like I remember a lot of Iso, but I could be wrong."
CharlotteHornets,3csqrd,HURCN_hugo,5,Fri Jul 10 14:51:24 2015 UTC,"When Al remembers to pass out of the double team is when Kemba gets his open looks, besides that it's hard to get open.  Feeding Al is not terrible if he passes out of the double, but a lot of the time he won't."
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,Macaway,7,Fri Jul 10 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"Bad move mainly because of Pek's contract. We would be regretting it for 3 years  And yeah Al is the man, he just isn't a good fit anymore with the rest if the squad. Which is why we are itching to see him traded"
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,skadoosh0019,4,Fri Jul 10 18:30:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want to gamble 3yr/$36M on Pekovic (especially coming off an Achilles injury).  No matter how Big Al turns out his season, he's coming off the books.  That's the deal breaker for me."
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,imeanYOLOright,0,Fri Jul 10 18:11:10 2015 UTC,Also if things do stop u can toss it to him for a close to gimme bucket

CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,1234Squad,4,Fri Jul 10 18:23:36 2015 UTC,For 40 games a season. Also most of his shots are super easy layups that come from Rubio feeds. Look at his numbers last year when Rubio was out.
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,justchillyo,3,Fri Jul 10 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Minny would go for that. Even if Pek's stock is low, it isn't like Big Al's is at an all time high either :-/"
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,Elcor05,3,Fri Jul 10 18:07:13 2015 UTC,1 year vs 3 years
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,justchillyo,2,Fri Jul 10 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yup, I figured Minny bites just because of all the cap it would clear the the next off season. Also Rubio would have an arsenal at his disposal of who he could dish it too, which is fun ball of course."
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,justchillyo,0,Fri Jul 10 18:34:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we'd bite hard. Charlotte would be dumb to offer this, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was a move you made."
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,Cubelar,7,Fri Jul 10 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"No thanks. I'd rather take Al's expiring and enjoy the 60 million in cap spac we have next year.  Here's my best case scenario for next summer, however unlikely it is. We do really well and surprise many people, finish with a top 5 seed and win a round or two in the playoffs. Batum and MKG sign extensions giving us a nice solid core next year. Our good season is enough to attract marquee free agents, my #1 priority would be Al Horford. Sign new Al to a max to replace old Al.  Kemba/Batum/MKG/Horford/Kaminsky  Let me dream."
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,Sharpshooter90,3,Fri Jul 10 19:20:24 2015 UTC,Good Lord that would be amazing
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,Glydedrex,3,Fri Jul 10 19:42:10 2015 UTC,Pekovic is more ass than Jefferson is.   I'd rather give Jefferson away as a salary dump
CharlotteHornets,3ctmu4,Aurion7,2,Fri Jul 10 23:38:26 2015 UTC,"No, thanks?   We've got Al for one more year, Nikola Pekovic is both a downgrade and signed for longer. Also, he's really not capable of creating his own offense from what I've seen of the Wolves. He feasts off Rubio's crazy passing."
CharlotteHornets,3cts7f,Jimaaadude,8,Fri Jul 10 18:38:56 2015 UTC,WTF. I feel like this is a wordpress project for a a late MS/Early HS kid. Trying to be random and funny.

If you say you were high, vindicated."
CharlotteHornets,3cts7f,net403,3,Fri Jul 10 18:49:11 2015 UTC,I know of Kemba Walker and it was more of an inside joke to start it. Yeah there's no sports at all in it

CharlotteHornets,3crho7,Don_Drapers_Tie,14,Fri Jul 10 14:01:03 2015 UTC,I think the influx of Lin post is just because of his signing. A lot of troll Lin post. Sure there will be post about him through-out the season but it won't be like his intial signing. But trolls are trolls they will make it seem like it's much worst than it actually is.

I have come to realize that he is significantly limited as a player and severely lacks the confidence to become a leader. He is not the same linsanity people fell for - not interns of skills but his demeanor as well.   But I digress - the thing that bothers me about the die hard Lin fans is not that they idolize him as much they feel the need to bash everyone especially his competitors when things start going awry. Pat Bev, Ronnie price, clarkson. They all have been and still are targets of these fans' ire things do not turn out the way they envisioned.   I wish Lin success, because he is a good kid But unfortunately a lot of anger against his fans gets misdirected at Lin. I hope history won't repeat itself here."

Imo after 3 seasons of below expectations most of his fans think he is around a 15/6 player if he can get into an ideal situation.

Guys like Hairston,  Kaminsky, Hawes, and Williams, are catch and shoot players that can really attack in the space that Lin can create. The Hornets second unit will have 3 pt shooting at every position, which will be interesting to see if this strategy can be effective."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,unclefunkjr,12,Fri Jul 10 05:28:37 2015 UTC,"Except Lin can shoot. And we won't be yelling at the TV/Screen every time he has the ball like we did with Sessions. And Lin won't be greedy with the ball like Sessions. And Lin has been improving on his turnovers unlike Sessions. Please don't mention Sessions on this sub, it gives me PTSD remembering all the pointless floaters and terrible floor general skills. The Sessions comparison is very unfair to anyone and would not wish it upon my worst enemy.   edit: Sessions rant aside, I agree with your points, I'm hoping our 2nd unit of PnR/PnP with Kaminsky/Hawes and 3 point shooting can be effective."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Kaendor,6,Fri Jul 10 07:40:10 2015 UTC,"Weird, I'm a wizards fan and I've loved sessions so far. He really knows how to drive and draws fouls like a machine. Kings fans didn't like him either so who knows how bit goes."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,devotedhero,5,Fri Jul 10 12:49:24 2015 UTC,"Sessions is an enigma who changes from a good player to a bad player every time the season changes , he signs with another team, or is traded. Or it's the playoffs and he's straight up garbage alla 11-12 lakers"
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Kaendor,3,Fri Jul 10 17:22:20 2015 UTC,sessions and mike brown basically destroyed that lakers team. 8 pts 3 assists 5 turnovers and 5 fouls shooting 16% in their playoff elimination game lol

He had his career high in scoring average in Charlotte, 14ppg, and once again was a BACKUP. Pointless floater?  Every pg in the league NEEDS a floater, if they want to score in the paint consistently. Stephen Curry has a money floater, and Sessions was respectable. He was one player who really gave his all when he was in Charlotte, and since his team got to the playoffs, his efforts deserve SOME respect."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,unclefunkjr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:54:12 2015 UTC,"Man were you watching the same sessions? Thats 14.4 ppg on a 21 win team and then 10 ppg on 40%, shooting at least one three-pointer a game at 22%. He looked passive, looking either for the foul (which he never got), a floater that DID NOT go in, and a three pointer which he never was good at and never will be. Watched Sessions be fool's gold on the Lakers, watched him be fool's gold here, was Sacramento's fool's gold, now he's Washington's."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Kaendor,2,Fri Jul 10 20:05:25 2015 UTC,Isn't it the other way around?  Won't Lin be attacking in the space they create?
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,zacka77ack,4,Fri Jul 10 11:26:31 2015 UTC,"Defenses would collapse when he drives into the paint, freeing up shooters."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,thesuspicious24,2,Sat Jul 11 16:25:21 2015 UTC,He is a great defender as well. Love this pickup.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Binatko,2,Fri Jul 10 05:14:36 2015 UTC,"Can someone tell me, if Lin does not start as the 2 guard, who does?"
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,hammeringhank44,6,Fri Jul 10 11:56:14 2015 UTC,"Batum is the starting shooting guard. Cho said it day 1 after the trade.  here is the direct quote from Cho's press conference   On if he sees Batum as a two and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist as a three:  Yes, [Nicolas] is a wing, so we see him starting at the two-guard spot with MKG starting at the three. [Nicolas] has played two and three in his career."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Cubelar,2,Fri Jul 10 11:59:59 2015 UTC,"He's 6'8""!  Wont he get killed at the other end by quick shooting guards?"
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,hammeringhank44,8,Fri Jul 10 13:27:26 2015 UTC,"Klay is 6'7. Batum only weighs 200 pounds he's lighter than MKG. It really is not that big of a deal. Batum defended shooting guards and even point guards in Portland.  Here's a quote on Batum from Zach Lowe during his Portland days   But his versatility is valuable. He can defend point guards for short stretches, and I like (count this as a mini-like) how Portland can stick the beefier Wesley Matthews on post-oriented small forwards while Batum slides to shooting guards.   Edit: I actually found a video of Batum successfully defending point guards. So here you go  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_2QsDkitUVI"
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Cubelar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:17:59 2015 UTC,I imagine MKG will be defending the opponent's 2 guard.  With Batum on the 3
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,MurrKeys,3,Fri Jul 10 14:18:13 2015 UTC,"MKG will probably end up guarding the best player/hottest player. Sometimes it's the point guard, sometimes it's the shooting guard and sometimes it's the small forward. The rest of the match ups will be determined by who MKG guards.  I remember a game last year were Reggie Jackson was torching Mo in the first half, he had 21 points at the half. Clifford put MKG on Reggie in the second half and he only had 4 points the rest of the game. Needless to say we came back and won."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Cubelar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:21:33 2015 UTC,yes.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,jonstarks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:02:32 2015 UTC,Does MKG play any 4? Just curious.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,blee3k,3,Fri Jul 10 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"He hasn't but in the same interview mentioned above, Cho said they would be experimenting with some small ball lineups with MKG at the 4. I think he definitely can, as he rebounds extremely well for his position."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,aceboogieville,2,Fri Jul 10 14:42:40 2015 UTC,"Lin is not trying to take the starting job, but I actually could see him taking it."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,DENTD3058,11,Fri Jul 10 13:26:52 2015 UTC,"Even if his skills could be on par with Kemba, that would be in limited situations, and there is no way they are going to push their 4 year contract guy to the bench to start the 2 year 4 million guy who at best, in an ideal scenario, would be only be comparable certainly not better"
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,net403,-12,Fri Jul 10 16:13:28 2015 UTC,should be open competition for starting PG. whats with the politicking?
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,mregoiste,18,Fri Jul 10 00:17:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really consider anything that's happening to be ""politicking"".  Jeremy Lin was brought in explicitly to be the backup PG, while potentially playing spot minutes alongside Kemba - much like Mo Williams last season.  By all indications, Lin himself understands, accepts, and even encourages this fact (just read his Facebook replies from last night).  Even more importantly, I think both very naturally fit into the roles that they'll be placed in.  Kemba Walker fits nicely in the starting unit's isolation-heavy offense.  His ability to limit turnovers, minimize mistakes, and create for himself when needed works wonders in the slow, methodical ""Alfense"" (which will be happening whether we like it or not).  Jeremy Lin fits nicely in the second unit's more PnR-heavy offense.  With Lin/Kaminsky + Shooters, this squad will run a more up-tempo, free-flowing style.  From everything I've watched, read, or seen about Jeremy Lin, this is the style in which he thrives."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,imeanYOLOright,3,Fri Jul 10 01:27:03 2015 UTC,Realistically how many minutes will lin play? ballpark. I assume 25-30 mpg? He stated on his facebook post that he wanted to be on the team with most opportunity and minutes so I'm assuming the team has a plan for him.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Nyanu,13,Fri Jul 10 01:38:48 2015 UTC,"As a rough estimate, I'd expect somewhere in the low-to-mid 20s.  A lot of it depends upon how the backup wings develop, though.  Jeremy Lin is pretty guaranteed to at least get the 14-16 MPG at backup PG when Kemba sits (for reference, he's averaged 33.2 MPG for his career).  Lin's indicated the possibility of playing alongside Kemba at the 2 as well (something Mo Williams occasionally did).  How much that happens will depend on how much consistent play the team gets out of the youthful group of Troy Daniels, Jeremy Lamb, PJ Hairston, or whoever else they sign.  If none develop quickly enough and Lin must cover for them, his minutes will obviously be higher.  If they develop nicely, his minutes will probably be a little lower."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,imeanYOLOright,3,Fri Jul 10 01:46:25 2015 UTC,"I suggested in the main thread on /r/NBA yesterday that it'll probably be in the ballpark of 26-28min. About half of those as backup PG, and the other half as more of a shooting/combo guard.  Of course that's assuming we don't sign another wing that can take spot minutes at the 2."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,buzzbuz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:52:32 2015 UTC,Seems like a reasonable role I hope he fits in your system.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Nyanu,-4,Fri Jul 10 02:00:30 2015 UTC,I'm guessing he'll be used like Manu. A 6th man that will often end games.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,BobcatsHornets,6,Fri Jul 10 04:19:52 2015 UTC,I don't see who among the starters sits at the end for Lin to close games.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Kaendor,3,Fri Jul 10 04:40:39 2015 UTC,"Long shot, but maybe slide Batum to 3, MKG to 4, for Lin at 2. And then either Al or Zeller are odd man out. MKG at the 4 has been a pretty deadly weapon in this past season, wanna see more of that."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,BobcatsHornets,3,Fri Jul 10 07:45:23 2015 UTC,"I would be ecstatic if we could dump Al but as long as we have him there's no way Clifford doesn't start him and center the offense around him. I like MKG as a 4 in certain situations but he's already fairly injury prone so I'd be real nervous putting him against big guys on a nightly basis. Plus the best scorers are on the wing and if we don't use MKG to guard the best opposing player, we aren't using him right."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Kaendor,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:39:13 2015 UTC,True true. Only certain situations would call for MKG at the 4
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,asher1611,14,Fri Jul 10 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"For there to be an open competition, you would have to say that Kemba was one of the weak links of the team and is in a perilous position as a starter.  But last year, Kemba was one of our strongest players.  I also don't see a reason why Lin and Kemba can't share the floor."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Cubelar,8,Fri Jul 10 00:42:15 2015 UTC,"Kemba's season last year can be broken down into 3 parts.   Part 1: Early season struggles.  Charlotte's record: 5-15 (note MKG only played 6 of these games)  Kemba's numbers: 14.3 PPG/5.6 APG/3.9 RPG/ 1.5 TOV/ 45% TS/ 40% EFG  Part 2: The return of MKG and Kemba's explosion  Charlotte's record: 10-10 (note MKG played ALL of these games)  Kemba's numbers: 24 PPG/ 5.2 APG/ 3.3 RPG/ 1.9 TOV/ 55% TS/ 50% EFG  Part 3 : Post knee surgery Kemba  Charlotte's record: 5-15 (note MKG only played 9 of these games)  Kemba's numbers: 14.3 PPG/ 4.9 APG/ 3.1 RPG/ 1.5 TOV/ 47% TS/  40% EFG  The question here is: Which Kemba do you think was the real Kemba?   I believe the second part of the season was more like the real Kemba. We had MKG, he was healthy and he played lights out. Early in the season we were starting Lance and Henderson, that provided NO spacing and a terrible offense. Late in the season Kemba was clearly struggling with his knee and rust. It was extremely disappointing to see Kemba miss time due to injury during the hottest streak of his career, I thought he had made the leap. I truly believe we will see more of the second Kemba this year and I am excited to see him play next to Batum"
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,lazydrumhead,0,Fri Jul 10 03:46:13 2015 UTC,They both have to have the ball in their hands to be effective...
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Nyanu,-12,Fri Jul 10 02:58:06 2015 UTC,One of your strongest players in what way? He shot less than 40 percent from the floor.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,ReidM15,13,Fri Jul 10 00:46:14 2015 UTC,That's what happens when he's the only player that can create a shot. The rest of our starting squad at the time couldn't. Leaving a bulk of the scoring needing to be done by Kemba. This year his percentage will definitely go up because we actually have players who can shoot.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Nyanu,-11,Fri Jul 10 00:55:47 2015 UTC,But his entire career has looked like this. You can't just blame all his poor play on that can you? But I guess I haven't watched him play much. We'll see if you're right about His percentages going up. But I still don't see the evidence of him being one of the strongest players on your team. Could you answer my question about what he does well to help the team?
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,buzzbuz,7,Fri Jul 10 01:07:18 2015 UTC,"He has a very good assist-turnover (Clifford's offensive and defensive systems both rely on low turnovers), incredibly athletic, good defender for his size, I really like him in drive and dish plays (he just hasn't had the shooters around him in the last few years for this to work), crazy handles and very, very good at creating shots.   But his entire career has looked like this. You can't just blame all his poor play on that can you?   Kemba's rookie year was on the historically bad 7 win Bobcat's team, and the best shooter he has had next to him in 4 years is probably Chris Douglas-Roberts. We've had an incredibly bad run of getting in knock down shooters only to have them fall apart and have career bad years. So yes, you could make an argument that his career stats are low because he has literally never played alongside any good shooters."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,justflop,3,Fri Jul 10 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can make this argument for Kemba, because sans NYC days Lin was more or less played out of position, and his stats suffered for it.   Reid15 is right in saying Kemba didn't have any shot-creators, much in the same way Lin didn't have bigs to play PNRs with in LA.   You're right in saying we will see though."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Cubelar,4,Fri Jul 10 01:10:07 2015 UTC,"Take a look at his stats last year in December to Mid Jan when he got injured. Then take a look at his stats from when he returned from injury to the end of the season. The difference is night and day, I believe Kemba was rushed back a little to help a playoff push and he certainly played with rust after the knee surgery.   I believe this year we will see more of the December- Janurary Kemba. His knee should be fully healthy and he will have players around him who can actually shoot. Batum is almost like a second point guard out there and he will help ease the ball handling load from Kemba.  Another thing you are not mentioning is Clifford's offensive philosophy, Clifford HATES turnovers more than anything else. He likes to pass a lot with low turnovers. Last year Kemba lead all point guards in turnover ratio and it wasn't even close; Kemba just did not turn the ball over. Lin obviously is more turnover prone and Clifford will not easily insert a turnover prone point guard into the lineup"
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Nyanu,-2,Fri Jul 10 01:14:51 2015 UTC,But his assist numbers are kind of low. If you don't take chances passing the ball very often then your turnovers will be low. Especially if you're just feeding the post a lot of the time which I'm assuming he was with Al Jefferson on the team? Then again I'm very ignorant about your team. I'll be following the hornets some this season and I'll hold off my judgement's for now.
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,imeanYOLOright,11,Fri Jul 10 01:23:26 2015 UTC,"I can't find the stat right now, but the Hornets had the highest percentage of missed open shots last season (I believe by a considerable margin).  It's hard to rack up lofty assist totals when no one can make a shot."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Cubelar,7,Fri Jul 10 01:37:34 2015 UTC,Charlotte's EFG% while open (nba.com qualifies open as nearest defender is 4-6 feet away) was 46.8% second lowest in the league  Charlotte's EFG% while wide open (6+ feet) was 48.9% lowest in the league  Charlotte's EFG% while the next closest defender was 10+ feet away(meaning only 1 defender within 10 feet of shooter) was 45.7% lowest in the league
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Cubelar,9,Fri Jul 10 02:43:16 2015 UTC,"Kemba was 5th in the league with 68.5 passes per game; Rondo, MCW, CP3 and Wall were the only players with more  Only 10.2% of Kemba's passes went to Al, so it's not like all he does is feed the post.   Teammates shot 39.46% when Kemba passed them the ball. Al shot a team high 45.7% when passed to by Kemba; while Lance shot 27.7% and Mo 22.2%  To put this into perspective, League wide FG% was 44.9%. What would Kemba's assists numbers be if his teammates just shot league average? I can't calculate that because not every pass can be registered an assist but suffice to say it would be a lot better.  Kemba lead all point guards with only 6.5 turnovers per 100 possession, next on the list? George Hill with 7.8  Kemba has learned and plays Clifford's system pretty well, he limits turnovers and finds open men. However Charlotte just could not hit open shots. Is Kemba perfect? No Is he an elite point guard? no. But I do not believe that Lin could play starting point guard in Clifford's system any better.  note i got all of these stats from nba.com player tracking"
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,ReidM15,6,Fri Jul 10 02:19:30 2015 UTC,"I mean having not seen the team, your ignorance is justified. The stats are not good. But his low assist numbers come from the lack of offensive game from our starting five the past few years. MKG can shoot now but isn't an offensive threat. So that's someone that makes it hard for Kemba to get a lot of assists. Same thing with Gerald Henderson, not a great shooter and can't shoot the three. A SG that can't shoot the three is almost useless. Our PF's also aren't great (yet). Zeller has improved both years but again, isn't a shot creator or offensive threat. And Al is just a paint clogger. Yeah he has great post moves, but he fails to recognize double teams. So he doesn't pass off to someone else who has a shot off the double team. All around the team last year just didn't mesh well. They didn't have any real offense identity. This year will be different."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,matt1918,-12,Fri Jul 10 01:34:34 2015 UTC,Kemba is a weak link. Csnt shoot or pass
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Daheixiong,7,Fri Jul 10 01:34:05 2015 UTC,Is there a guy on our team you actually like?  Because so far I've seen you hate:  1) Clifford  2) MKG  3) Kemba  Might as well air it all out and drop the rest of the names
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,bubowskee,3,Fri Jul 10 02:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, he likes Lin"
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Sir_Gunner,3,Fri Jul 10 07:07:17 2015 UTC,"I hope it turns into a competition, that'll only get the best out of both of them."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,justflop,2,Fri Jul 10 00:25:17 2015 UTC,"This. Only this. No point in intentionally yanking one for another.  Unfortunately, I see so many similarities between Walker's game and Lin's that I don't think they'd be effective in overlapping, unless they figure out a pop and shoot routine with Lin at the 2 - but only for a few minutes a game cause that's not his strong suit either.   I'm excited. If what I've read over the past few days is correct at all, and the Hornets are trying to move towards a faster tempo offense, this could work really well for both parties."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,matt1918,3,Fri Jul 10 01:02:19 2015 UTC,Their games aren't that similar IMO
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,arktic_P,3,Fri Jul 10 01:33:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree.   On the one hand Walker is faster, has better handles, and is a better defender.  But Lin is a better shooter and is much better in the pick and roll/pick and pop situations."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,Scarlatina,5,Fri Jul 10 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Lin was measured to have better top speed than pre-injury Derrick Rose, and Kyrie Irving with better acceleration than John Wall (Wall has the best top end speed in the league). This was a couple seasons ago when Lin just signed with the Rockets, but I don't think he has lost much.  Lin does lack lateral speed, so he doesn't really juke people out of their shoes much, but he does blow past them if given a small opening."
CharlotteHornets,3cqmvg,arktic_P,3,Fri Jul 10 06:11:32 2015 UTC,"http://thebamboxscore.com/2012/02/29/more-linsights/  I found the testing you referenced, and you were close but off on a couple things.

CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,FuckTheClippers,3,Fri Jul 10 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"Seriously...Haha, I like him just cause of the linsanity moniker, which incidentally is all I know about him..."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,sovietsrule,12,Thu Jul 9 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"I've just been very surprised today after researching this LOF phenomenon.  There's actually truth to it, Laker and Rockets fans posting the same things going back a few years.  Wow, JLin has a preinstalled fan base with a significant portion of them over zealous lovers and haters that follow him around everywhere and fight so much, they literally have a reputation that precedes them lol  It seems almost like a sideshow that follows a high-media signing"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,net403,3,Thu Jul 9 21:55:12 2015 UTC,Do you think we should be scared?
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,sovietsrule,6,Thu Jul 9 23:10:27 2015 UTC,"Scared of being annoyed potentially lol  The common thread seems to be extremely annoyed, but the accounts are more or less all described the same way the ""warning posts"" did here.  One example: In depth analysis of Lin's 4 points and 1 assist in 4 minutes of garbage time, also lots of people cite the head coach being called a racist a lot lol  I'm sure some people will think I'm making these statements myself but no I'm just reflecting what I've been seeing. But there again, having a more active subreddit is nice if we can keep the convo well-rounded."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,net403,4,Thu Jul 9 23:16:52 2015 UTC,Agreed! Haha. It IS Linsanity after all!

CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,WumboJumbo,22,Thu Jul 9 22:31:06 2015 UTC,This is a very reasonable request.  I'm an admitted LOF after 40+ years of being a Knick fan -- then I realized I was no longer rooting for that messed up franchise.  I hope the LOF community will rally to the Hornets and not unduly dominate your fansites and forums.  Most of us are pretty objective.  I think!
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,hammeringhank44,3,Thu Jul 9 17:48:55 2015 UTC,LOF?

CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,leshric,3,Thu Jul 9 23:55:14 2015 UTC,It has aleays been like that for me all throughout knicks houston and lakers but I guess there are just those people who ruin it for the rest of us. That or people are just trolls.
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,cjbt,14,Thu Jul 9 22:04:18 2015 UTC,"Lin fans have been to the rock bottom. As a result, a few have turned nasty out of disappointment, others became silent observers trying to stay out of shouting match with the haters.   I am all for the positive movement. I do ask those who are positive & reasonable, please dont be afraid to be vocal. Dont let the ""crazy"" ones destroy our image as LOFs.  I hope we all can keep our composure carrying forward, and lets not let any negativity lead us to opposite direction. Just constantly remind ourselves, we have been to the worst situations possible, it could've been worse.   And even during the bad times, nice Laker fans and Rocket fans do exist. Not all of them are haters. Dont let the select few ruin for the rest of them either. Lets just keep it positive, support Lin and his team, teammates, and fans with our all. Ignore the haters.   Let's go BuzzNation!"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,supjackjack,6,Thu Jul 9 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"Let's not use the term LOF.  Lakersground mod did a good thing by banning that, it's a label that only serves to promote divisiveness."

Lin fan = LOF it's the same to them.  so use the term LOF or not, they think of us the same group of people.   What they will perceive tho, is directly influenced by how we collective behave. If we gonna be toxic, Lin fans will be seemed as annoying. If we gonna be reasonable, and realistic, we'll be just fine :)"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,supjackjack,4,Fri Jul 10 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"You have a very good point in not letting the ""crazies"" destroy our image.  This is a fresh start for everybody, lets all try to have a positive mindset going forward."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,ejanebelle,11,Fri Jul 10 03:24:19 2015 UTC,"I have an even better idea, how about the more hardcore Lin fans just.. leave the Hornet's forums and subreddit alone and just stick to the Lin ones?  In sports every player is going to have haters trash talk them online, Lin is no different.  Last year every player on the Lakers had some harsh stuff thrown their way by fans; Chucking Kobe, Pushoff Boozer, halfassed Hill, head of the snake Price, Swaggy.. everyone.  It's ok, they're getting paid millions of $$.  Us fans don't need to defend their honor.    I hope us Lin fans have learned from the Rockets and Lakers experiences.  Don't flood other team's boards if all you want to do is talk about Lin.  Honestly you help the haters by acting in exactly the way they try to portray all Lin fans.. crazy obsessive and not allowing anyone to say anything bad.  If you really want to help Lin, then please do this.  He took a huge paycut to play for a small market team for a reason (no offense Hornets fans), let the guy play without drama and negative feelings surrounding him and rebuild his career without baggage.  In reality there are only a few crazies, and many are likely trolls, but they really stand out and make us all look bad."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,HRenmei,4,Thu Jul 9 22:50:49 2015 UTC,It's depressing really. I'm a fan of Lin but it's impossible to find any good discussion on him online. There are just some very passionate fans who can't help themselves. They can't hold themselves back in arguments and will repeat the same point over and over and over and over and over in an effort to convince the other guy. Any intelligent discussion just gets lost amidst the clutter.
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,joepu,3,Fri Jul 10 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"No shyt, we're now flooding the Hornets subreddit and have idiots posting bs.  I can't tell if they're trolls or idiots, I'm just gonna start reporting and hope the mods start deleting and banning.  They can take their stupid flamewars to twitter and fb -__-"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,HRenmei,-3,Fri Jul 10 03:02:02 2015 UTC,Yeah... based on what was seen on /r/rockets and /r/lakers I'm afraid they will never leave this subreddit until Lin leaves Charlotte.   It sucks because the Hornets have awesome potential this year but they are gonna have to deal with downvotes from Lin Only Fans.
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,Schneeky,4,Fri Jul 10 04:50:10 2015 UTC,"And you are here to stir the pot.  Pot meet kettle, hope both you and the idiots get banned."

Like as a Lakers fan we went through that shit in every fansite and although I am relieved that LOFs are now gone, I feel bad for Hornets fans.. especially the ones posting on /r/lakers asking about the toxic Lin fans already."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,Schneeky,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:13:37 2015 UTC,"You're greatly exaggerating the ""problem"".  The Lakers board was largely fine. The biggest problems happened when someone would purposely try to bait or troll the Lin fans because they thought it was fun."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,WinningGuy,3,Mon Jul 13 00:09:41 2015 UTC,"A heads up from a person that considers himself pretty level-headed...  Lin has a lot of passionate fans. 95% of them are great.   1) Some know very little about basketball and will ask a lot of questions. Or they may make comments that you would expect from a very casual basketball observer.  2) Some are dang near geniuses. It's a pleasure to read their very detailed basketball breakdowns, statistics, and general opinions on coaching strategy.   3) Some are fans of another team, but are also NBA fans in general. So they like a few players in the league outside of their favorite team. Lin being one of them. They want to see one of their favorite players succeed... except when it's against their team.   4) Some are overly emotional and defensive. They take things personally. I kind of don't blame them too much because the Rockets forum beat them up a lot. The Lakers forum wasn't that bad except for a few guys that liked to try to (forgive my analogy) poke the hornet's nest. But these overly emotional guys will often be reigned in by the other Lin fans.  5) You'll also find pretend Lin fans. They will post ridiculous things in order to try to turn your community against Lin and his fans. They want you to label all Lin fans in a negative way. These are people that kind of follow Lin fans around because they find pleasure in making them mad. Their posts are pretty easy to identify.   I happen to be a Lakers fan, but I do like talking with other Lin fans and I do want to see his team succeed. (except against the Lakers of course) I admit that the excitement surrounding Linsanity was kind of infectious, and the Linsanity movie was inspiring.   I, like many, don't intend to come here and take things over. Hopefully the signing of Lin will make other casual Hornets fans pay a little more attention and start posting online.   Good luck on the season. I'll probably stop by once in a while."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,WinningGuy,2,Sun Jul 12 23:54:21 2015 UTC,This fanbase has a tendency to flip flop on every player on the team on a game-by-game basis. Even the jersey sellers (Kemba/Al/MKG) can't escape it and I shudder imagining how this will go over with Lin fans whenever he underperforms.
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,MechaZain,10,Fri Jul 10 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"You should call out the Lin only haters instead. Lin only fans aren't negative as long as Lin is treated well, which he wasn't the past 2 years"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,fruchtzergeis,16,Thu Jul 9 18:27:30 2015 UTC,I like Lin but people are allowed to think he sucks. Let's not make him the focal point of this sub. This is the hornets sub. If all someone wants to talk about is Lin then they should make /r/jeremylin a thing.   EDIT: that sub is actually a thing apparently so please just go there for most of that stuff. It's not necessary or respectful to hornets fans to make this sub significantly about him. He is a backup pg after all.
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,BobcatsHornets,11,Thu Jul 9 19:19:54 2015 UTC,"All this talk about Lin only fans, which I've never heard of til today, has me slightly nervous now lol"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,net403,6,Thu Jul 9 19:35:46 2015 UTC,It's exactly the opposite: The people who warn people about Lin only fans who are the toxic ones. Look at how many threads they already opened just to warn people about the LOF.
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,fruchtzergeis,5,Thu Jul 9 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yea is it the chicken or the egg though, why are there so many haters?  It's quite a strange situation really lol  Something has inspired the anti-fans as much as the fans, I am not familiar with anything like this locally here before.  The haters would be just as bad as the lovers either way pretty weird exchange"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,net403,9,Thu Jul 9 23:50:34 2015 UTC,give it a few months and you will find out why this is a thing
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,wanderfound,5,Fri Jul 10 02:32:19 2015 UTC,"I think I already am, after googling it, and seeing the haters and lovers both make their supporting argument, it's all becoming strangely clear lol  I've heard enough to try and not think about it anymore as it's incredibly juvenile.  I welcome the good Lin fans though"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,net403,4,Fri Jul 10 03:17:34 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking makes sense, these dudes aren't just going to randomly go around trolling Jeremy Lin fans out of the blue, and some LOFs are already saying the opposite lol   what a sideshow and it's only been 24 hours jeez"

CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,net403,5,Mon Jul 13 01:49:59 2015 UTC,Most Lin fans are already congregating at Lin forums.  The ones that bitterly argue with every one are haters that pretend to be fans.
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,WinningGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"I've observed some people that are genuinely Lin fans that also argue way too much. But that happens in any group. There will be some people that are too emotional.   But I have also seen the phenomenon you are speaking of. It is pretty strange, but after a few posts they become pretty easy to identify."

CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,sacollie,8,Mon Jul 13 00:14:57 2015 UTC,"So? I mean honestly if he plays like shit, people may say stuff like that. It happens. All players should be treated with respect, but y'all just seem to be over the top; I have never heard of this Lin only fans bs until today."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,fruchtzergeis,2,Thu Jul 9 19:23:57 2015 UTC,Because it is exaggerated to the max. Think about redditors talking all the time about the cases where some guy is falsely accused of rape with the actual prevalence of it.
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,WinningGuy,2,Fri Jul 10 03:27:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and to be honest, a lot of it does have some racist overtones. I remember on Clutchfans there was a whole bunch of racism towards Asians in general when they tried to bash Lin. And the moderator allowed it all."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,peacebuster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:31:39 2015 UTC,"Clutchfans was pretty much what started all of the drama.   I observed there, but didn't post much because it would be pointless. Blatant racism was allowed there against not only Lin, but against posters. I can't really blame them for being a little sensitive because of that.  The biggest Lakers forum did a pretty good job of nipping that in the bud. So over there the overall experience was fine."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,joepu,12,Fri Jul 10 04:18:58 2015 UTC,Haters are everywhere. You just learn to ignore them and don't feed the troll!
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,fruchtzergeis,-1,Mon Jul 13 00:17:41 2015 UTC,"Then why don't you ignore Lin Only Fans too and don't feed them, instead of making a thread calling them out?"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,joepu,3,Thu Jul 9 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"That's the problem, whether or not Lin is being treated well is subjective.  If someone doesn't agree with you just let it go, don't jump all over them."
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,rustydomino,0,Thu Jul 9 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, but not on all cases. Starting Ronnie 'DPOY' Price over Lin is objectively mistreating Lin"
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,cjbt,2,Fri Jul 10 02:51:48 2015 UTC,And the vast majority of Lakers fans agreed with that.  Some though aren't content with that and feel that they need to convince every single fan.
CharlotteHornets,3cp55l,Sir_Gunner,6,Fri Jul 10 03:03:48 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone. I am a very casual NBA fan and have no particular affiliation with any team except maybe the Mavs because I went to school in Dallas. I am however Chinese American and an avowed and unashamed Lin fan and supporter. After having lurked at /r/rockets and /r/Lakers and now here, I can say that my first impression is the The Hornets fans seem to generally be much classier than those of the other aforementioned teams.

He wasn't traded and the chance of a Harden type suddenly appearing on the team is very unlikely. He had close to 10 teams interested according to the rumors. Lin has accepted his role as a 6th man/spot starter type and you crazies (LOFs who are quick to call racist, not simple fans of Lin) need to as well.   Edit: why is this being downvoted?

CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,paulzors,5,Thu Jul 9 15:50:09 2015 UTC,I had no idea he was getting paid that much. Who the hell pays Marvin Williams 7 mil/year?!
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,nuck_futs,5,Thu Jul 9 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was a bit of a miscalculation. Marvin is the classic sort of player who looks a lot more attractive from afar than he does when you see him play every day."
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,Aurion7,13,Thu Jul 9 19:23:49 2015 UTC,"KJ McDaniels would be a fun addition. Dude was electric playing for the sixers. As for another big I like the idea of Reggie Evans. Solid rebounder, great locker room guy, okay defender."
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,turnertornado,10,Thu Jul 9 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people on this sub want to add a defensive big, but I'm with the front office on this one we have too many bigs and too few minutes already.  Most likely we're going to add some depth on the wing, someone who can play the 3 or the 2. But mostly the 3 because MKG, PJ and moving Batum over are the only options we have there"
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,Cubelar,4,Thu Jul 9 17:09:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if the word out of the front office is any indication, the Hornets are now looking more likely to opt for signing two wings.  To me, the most likely outcome is signing Aaron Harrison for the minimum and using the MLE to pick up a bigger wing (like you said)."

CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,Elcor05,4,Thu Jul 9 17:30:07 2015 UTC,Six bigs is probably too many. But I'd rather have Bis than Williams or Hawes.
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,skadoosh0019,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:30:05 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Cho and what he's done here, that's a retarded reason for not giving Biz the QO. Its not about how many you have, its about whether the bigs you have can offer complimentary skillsets to the guys on the floor. And right now, we have no one who can provide a defensive/rim protecting/rebounding stud component to our team, 5 big guys or no.  We'll see how the rest of free agency goes, but I think we're going to regret not bringing back Biz."
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,Cubelar,3,Fri Jul 10 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"I think the true reason Biz wasn't retained was that the team didn't want to go over the (originally projected at $81.7M) luxury tax threshold.  If they had signed Biyombo's QO, used the mid-level exception, and used the biannual exception, the Hornets would have had a cap number of ~$84.5M.  I doubt Jordan & Cho were willing to pay taxes for a squad they knew wasn't going to contend for a championship.  The depressing fact in hindsight is that - with the higher than expected $84.7M tax line announced - Charlotte wouldn't have been over the tax anyway.  And IMO, Biz would have certainly been an asset to this team."
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,Aurion7,2,Fri Jul 10 01:59:14 2015 UTC,Exactly. I said this same thing in another post earlier. It was a combination of both not going to want to over the luxury tax and too many bigs in the rotation.
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,peacebuster,3,Fri Jul 10 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"I generally agree that we've got too many big guys, even if we kind of need some defensive solidity up front.   Not many appetizing options on the FA table left at this point honestly, unless there's a guy the FO really wants I don't think there's really a MLE-worthy name around still. I suppose we could throw an offer sheet KJ's way.  e: If that's even allowed. It probably isn't. shrug"
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,Aurion7,3,Thu Jul 9 19:22:53 2015 UTC,This team looks like it needs a rim protector and a 2-guard.
CharlotteHornets,3coqw1,HURCN_hugo,2,Thu Jul 9 23:33:20 2015 UTC,"Batum will play 2. Not his natural position, but between him, MKG, Lamb, and Daniels (all have the size to play 2 or 3 credibly imo) I think we'll be fine. PJ is also an option since he can play either wing spot.  Rim protector I agree with, but not sure there's anyone worth getting. And we're pretty tight on frontcourt minutes."

CharlotteHornets,3cp6gb,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think Lamb can play or guard the 3, maybe only in emergency. He's only 180 pounds, very light for a small forward.

CharlotteHornets,3cp6gb,matt1918,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:01 2015 UTC,Might be a minimum guy tbh if we snag a direct backup instead of just shuffling the wing deck around when MKG sits. Throwing the MLE at someone for the sake of throwing the MLE at someone probably isn't a good idea.
CharlotteHornets,3cp6gb,Aurion7,2,Thu Jul 9 20:01:28 2015 UTC,"Warriors recently traded David Lee to the Celtics for Gerald Wallace, though I don't think it's gone official yet. I did see that the Warriors would likely waive Wallace with the amnesty provision however.. if that happens, maybe we could pick him up for fairly cheap to play some backup SF."
CharlotteHornets,3cp6gb,zdnorman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:46:47 2015 UTC,I love Gerald. I want him to come back and be a hornet. But he simply is not good enough to get heavy minutes at this point in his career. His game is based on athleticism and naturally at this age it has dwindled.
CharlotteHornets,3cp6gb,hornetsfan47,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:30:35 2015 UTC,"True, but I think with MKG, Batum (occasionally), and PJ Hairston sharing time at SF, he wouldn't be needed for too many minutes."
CharlotteHornets,3cp6gb,zdnorman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:44:00 2015 UTC,"It's PJ atm, but I am sure that we will sign a vet. Batum can also slide over but he's going to see more minutes at the 2."
CharlotteHornets,3cp6gb,Cubelar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"I think we'll be targeting a swing man that can at least guard both positions.  At the moment I would suggest we stagger Batum and MKGs minutes so that between them they cover the 3, then you have Lin and Lamb covering backup minutes at the 2 (with Batum obviously starting at the 2). Marv can play 3 in a pinch, but I don't love him at that spot. PJ could too, but I don't see him getting many minutes.  I think if Clifford wanted to push for a 9man rotation like Kemba/Lin/Batum/Lamb/MKG/Cody/Marv/Big Al/(Frank or Hawes) I think it works. I tried to work out the minutes yesterday but it was doing my head in."

CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,PerpetualGazebo,4,Fri Jul 10 07:41:11 2015 UTC,This is his make or break year. He would be an EXCELLENT 6th man if he doesnt come together.
CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,net403,0,Fri Jul 10 07:41:59 2015 UTC,"This is his make or break year, on the first year of his 4 year contract?  I'd have to say we give him 2 or 3 more years at least lol  He is already performing as well as you could expect so no reason to think he is on thin ice either, hes easily in the top 15 starting PGs, maybe top 12.  He could probably be an excellent 6th man though, not in Charlotte unless we happen upon an all star PG unexpectedly. We are committed to him for better or worse for the foreseeable future though"
CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,BobcatsHornets,3,Fri Jul 10 16:30:41 2015 UTC,I think this is the first year we can accurately judge his performances. He will be playing the role he will end up playing if is a good player on a good team. Won't be forced into hero ball 15 possessions a game. Has an opportunity to actually play point guard with good shooters around.
CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,net403,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yea, no hero ball dribbling the air out of it every time hopefully. His head is definitely not on the cutting board, the only way that could happen is if a legit all star PG falls right into our laps to replace our fringe all star PG, which is so unlikely I'd buy everyone a tshirt if it did lol  He's got good handles and good shooting under pressure so I hope to see the floor open up more for him this year, damn I wish October was here."
CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,ampman_1789,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"I'd give him this year and next if Cho manages to reassemble another good roster. He's only 25, there could be room to improve or a learning curve to being a true point. In any event I'm with you that he would be a great 6th man if he could be more efficient. He could probably win 6th man award if he goes down that path in his career."
CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,Sharpshooter90,3,Sat Jul 11 19:13:32 2015 UTC,I was about to go off on you after reading the first sentence.
CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,NotHomeToday,3,Fri Jul 10 19:53:26 2015 UTC,I will trade you 1 Lin for 1 Swaggy P
CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,NotHomeToday,8,Fri Jul 10 06:18:47 2015 UTC,"I will trade you 1 Divac for 1 Kobe       real talk though I don't understand why young is being mentioned in trade talks, I honestly love the guy"
CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,net403,2,Fri Jul 10 06:19:57 2015 UTC,I love Swaggy to I love how happy he is just playing ball and he always has the confidence to take any shot might not always be the right one though lol
CharlotteHornets,3crqm3,HURCN_hugo,4,Fri Jul 10 06:22:16 2015 UTC,"The thing about him is he can randomly light you up for 30 one night then the next night pull some stupid black hole shit, but he'll always give 100% thats why I love him"
CharlotteHornets,3cna1a,Scarlatina,6,Thu Jul 9 05:52:55 2015 UTC,Lin has always been very good with the media and answered these questions very well. I would much rather have a guy who might sound overly scripted at times than a flight risk in front of a microphone or on social media. I feel like Lin will be very successful in the Queen City as the head of the 2nd unit.
CharlotteHornets,3cna1a,BombSquad123,3,Thu Jul 9 12:32:24 2015 UTC,I think he might get a pretty good amount of first team action which his shooting percentage
CharlotteHornets,3cna1a,MAC500,3,Thu Jul 9 12:53:59 2015 UTC,"If Clifford told him he would play alongside Kemba some I wouldn't doubt it. It's one thing for someone else to say that but Clifford actually makes that decision. Seems like he'll be 6th man, running 2nd unit and playing alongside Kemba too."
CharlotteHornets,3cna1a,ampman_1789,3,Thu Jul 9 14:08:52 2015 UTC,"It sounds like they are carving out a Ginobli type role for Lin.  Plenty of playing time with both units and the main ball handler/penetrater with the second unit.    If he can get his usual chemistry going with the players on that second unit, the Hornets will be very entertaining next season."
CharlotteHornets,3cna1a,HelpMeWithGimpScript,-6,Thu Jul 9 18:33:19 2015 UTC,Better hope he does because if he doesn't you'll hear about it from his fans.
CharlotteHornets,3cna1a,aveydey,13,Thu Jul 9 13:35:01 2015 UTC,"Props to   1) Actually responding to random fans  2) Saying everything right.    *I was really surprised he responded to the one about the Mavs which was the most interesting reply.    I believe he also says something about the Mavs to another persons comment (paraphrasing):  ""Don't believe everything the Media says about what's going on""  Please let me know if you find the actual quote and Ill change it."
CharlotteHornets,3cna1a,Daheixiong,10,Thu Jul 9 06:53:01 2015 UTC,"""You really fucked the mavs over""    What you read from the media isnt always the full story   I was surprised by how many comments he replied to, but some of it did sound like he was doing a press conference in NBA 2k and just trying to say the right thing. Still, he comes across as a very classy guy."
CharlotteHornets,3cna1a,buzzbuz,2,Thu Jul 9 10:33:45 2015 UTC,Best PR ever. He's already more endearing than Lance ever was...can't wait to get a Lin bobble head!
CharlotteHornets,3cnhjn,Daheixiong,6,Thu Jul 9 07:26:15 2015 UTC,"That's wild, why does Lin have such an intense following?  Just because of that few weeks of Linsanity years ago? It is kind of neat that he is sort of a fan phenomenon that we have on the roster now, obviously it will attract much needed attention."
CharlotteHornets,3cnhjn,net403,6,Thu Jul 9 17:20:43 2015 UTC,The whole Asian NBA fan base loves Jeremy Lin and like you said the whole linsanity underdog thing attracted a lot of fans for Jeremy Lin. He was my favorite basketball player 3 years ago due to linsanity.
CharlotteHornets,3cnhjn,buttholesmasherrager,3,Thu Jul 9 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"Is he like the modern day Yao Ming, popularity wise?"
CharlotteHornets,3cnhjn,net403,4,Thu Jul 9 17:32:58 2015 UTC,"I think Lin is even more famous than Yao because of his underdog story. It inspired even non-basketball fans during that time. Also, Lin is super Christian, so that's another audience that's really drawn to him.  Oh, and he loves DOTA so that's probably his biggest audience? Ha!  Yao is still more popular in China though."
CharlotteHornets,3cnhjn,net403,3,Thu Jul 9 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"Super Christian, he definitely came to the right market.  That is exciting in itself to have a much beloved player on the roster, hopefully he will play well too, but I'm not sure how many players we've ever had that were nationally followed like that before.  Suddenly the spotlight gets a little brighter."
CharlotteHornets,3cnhjn,zacka77ack,2,Thu Jul 9 17:47:06 2015 UTC,I need to play DOTA with him...
CharlotteHornets,3cnhjn,sovietsrule,2,Thu Jul 9 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the only thing I knew about him when we signed him...Haha."
CharlotteHornets,3cnhjn,cbtaylor23,4,Thu Jul 9 17:38:17 2015 UTC,What about when the name came back to Charlotte?  I wasn't around here but I imagine that was big news.
CharlotteHornets,3cnhjn,cbtaylor23,2,Thu Jul 9 14:49:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe on /r/nba, but definitely not /r/all"

He may not be putting all star numbers (although, I really root for him too lol), but he gives it his all every night and is a gym rat.  I've always liked Charlotte, so I'll definitely be cheering for you guys."
CharlotteHornets,3cmmuo,Igemonas,2,Thu Jul 9 04:44:45 2015 UTC,"A gym rat, huh?  Would you call him a real scrappy player?"

CharlotteHornets,3cmzeq,hankliny,18,Thu Jul 9 04:07:22 2015 UTC,"This is my farewell to Jeremy, who I both enjoyed and struggled to watch on my Lakers last season. He is a quality player who can be really productive in pnr heavy offense. Our coach Byron Scott thinks pnr stops ball movement, so yeah, I will leave it at here.  Hornets fans, treat him well. He is a really nice guy and he puts up the effort night in and night out. He was just a really bad fit for Byron’s offense.  Good luck Jeremy, wish you best of luck with the Hornets!"
CharlotteHornets,3cmzeq,DaBigTree,12,Thu Jul 9 04:07:34 2015 UTC,"When this guy said it stops ball movement and every possession ends up in a Kobe post up, I thought he might have down syndrome"

CharlotteHornets,3cml48,handgredave,3,Thu Jul 9 02:59:21 2015 UTC,"This is much lower than our MLE, correct? Could this mean we still have our MLE and we signed him to a separate agreement?"
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,Cubelar,5,Thu Jul 9 02:12:33 2015 UTC,This could be the bi-annual exception. Another option is splitting the MLE in two. I still think we're looking at another wing player to provide depth at the 3.
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,jaynay1,3,Thu Jul 9 02:31:17 2015 UTC,Oh so that's why we didn't sign Aaron Harrison yet.
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,1234Squad,3,Thu Jul 9 03:14:10 2015 UTC,Wish we got him for longer
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,alyateemwd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:37:30 2015 UTC,If he plays well we extend the contract.
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,1234Squad,2,Thu Jul 9 07:13:06 2015 UTC,"I know. But if he plays well, which be most likely will, he will be more expensive. Wish we could have signed him for like 4 years 13 mil or something"
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,alyateemwd,2,Thu Jul 9 14:14:27 2015 UTC,I got you. It's safe for both sides though.
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,Neri25,2,Thu Jul 9 15:16:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he has no reason to take a long cheap deal."
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,ChimichangasSmangas,2,Thu Jul 9 21:53:15 2015 UTC,Great deal!
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,Garrett3420,2,Thu Jul 9 02:42:52 2015 UTC,Does he have a player option in the second year?
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,Gurchimo,2,Thu Jul 9 17:17:32 2015 UTC,Goodness that is cheap as hell
CharlotteHornets,3cml48,Aurion7,2,Thu Jul 9 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"How on earth we landed a useful NBA point guard for 2 million dollars a year only God knows.  Even assuming anyone had actually mentioned acquiring Lin beforehand, I would have definitely expected him to command the MLE."

So it is pretty damn difficult to get a ticket on your own.  The best bet to actually meeting the players is to go to a bund club where they will be after.

CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,hanumanmode,27,Thu Jul 9 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"Most excited about:  We have a stockpile of players that are extremely unique.  Not necessarily good, but definitely unique.  Like there's not really another player that plays like MKG, Cody Zeller, Spencer Hawes, Al Jefferson, Kemba Walker, Nic Batum, Frank Kaminsky, or for that matter, Jeremy Lin. Strengths:  We don't turn the ball over -- first in the league in that.  We get defensive rebounds -- also first there.  Defense is an overall strength, but I'm not sure how well that will hold into next season when we don't have a single good rim protector on our roster. Weaknesses:  We don't pass well, and we don't shoot well.  And we don't get offensive rebounds particularly well.  Basically anything that doesn't involve not turning the ball over, we don't do well.  The problems are probably in that order for priority. Realistic prospects for next season:  5th-7th seed, maybe as low as 8th. Best case scenario:  2nd seed.  I don't think we can outright win the conference, given that the Cavs exist, but I don't think there's another team in the conference that we don't have a chance of beating out in the standings. Worst case scenario:  I think 2014-15 is a pretty good picture of the worst case scenario.  So mid-lottery but not bad enough to get a pick at the very top. What is Coach Clifford's system on Offense:  Al Jefferson.  Though I think he'll be a little more creative this year, since he'll have a lot more tools available to him in the myriad shooters we brought in. The defensive system is based loosely on the system Stan Van Gundy used in Orlando, where Clifford was an assistant.  Loosely, of course, since he doesn't have the best defender this side of Ben Wallace playing for him. Things we can do in the rest of the offseason:  Sign Aaron Harrison.  Aaron Harrison has looked good for our summer league team and can play either guard spot, and is even big enough to play the 3 in a pinch.  Trade one of our bigs.  Not Zeller of course, but any of Hawes, Al, or Marvin Williams should be on the block, and we should be pushing hard to move them.  Finally, sign a defensive big with the MLE.  Josh Smith is the ideal one but I'm not counting on it.  Luc Richard Mbah A Moute and Kevin Seraphin are more likely targets. MJ's cool.  He's a cool figurehead and he seems to be doing a good job on staying out of decisions. Cho may be an idiot, or he may not be.  I'm not sure anymore.  I'll say a move is terrible, and then before a game is even played it'll start to look really good.  I'll say a move is great, and then before a game is even played it'll start to look terrible.  He doesn't do what I would do and he prioritizes players I think are terrible fits, but he's put together a decent roster for next year with the ability to start over if it doesn't work in the summer of 2016."
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,jaynay1,4,Thu Jul 9 05:11:03 2015 UTC,Well said.
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,paulzors,5,Thu Jul 9 05:26:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks this is a great write-up. Im a big NBA fan (Rockets before Jlin and Yao) but also a Jlin fan so ill be hanging out. I like to consider myself a logical one. Ive been watching basketball since I was 5 in 1985.  But yea one thing Ive noticed is Charlotte fans are a lot friendlier. Everyone seems pretty happy to have him on board. Almost every team hes been on since NY, when the buzz started there was so much ""that dude sucks"" (even happened on twitter with a bunch of Mavs fans this time around.  He's a good player whose elite at getting to the rim (not always finishing there). His shooting is improving. And his bad defense is overstated. Ill give you guys a better write up when I get some time today"
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,jaynay1,3,Thu Jul 9 12:34:39 2015 UTC,"I think we have the advantage of being the first team to be underpaying him since NY, where the Lakers and Rockets probably overpaid."
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,HURCN_hugo,2,Thu Jul 9 14:02:23 2015 UTC,Do we know if its a solid 2 year or is it 1 + option?

CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,MrAtlantic,10,Thu Jul 9 14:59:32 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing you will find about Charlotte is that J-Lin (IMO) will finally be able to relax.  I mean, honestly, for his national and international brand, Houston, NY and LA were great.  Great, but suffocating.  It seems as if Cho and Clifford have not only targeted him, but see him as key to being our 6th man, and depending on what we want to do, our 2 guy to pair with Kemba.  For next season, it is IMPOSSIBLE to say.  If someone accurately predicts our record next year in this thread I will buy them a jersey here in Shanghai (fake, sorry i'm poor) and I will send it to their location.  Personally I feel like we could be better, but with such a different team from last year, I won't say a number.  MJ and Cho are going for what they think will help this team.  I'm also not sure about how this will turn out.  We are excited for Lin and that is the most sure I can say right now!"
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,psychonaughties,7,Thu Jul 9 05:05:04 2015 UTC,"I think it will be a 42-40 year   EDIT: The fact that someone downvoted this is fucking embarrassing.

CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,Toposimus,3,Thu Jul 9 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"If the points are 0 or in the negatives, that means someone has down voted you, deeming your post to be incorrect, irrelevant, and useless.

At one point my post was in the negatives, which was pretty stupid. It's since gotten up voted, which is great.

CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,knotswag,2,Thu Jul 9 15:11:38 2015 UTC,43-39.  This team is ready for a 7 seed.
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,buzzbuz,6,Thu Jul 9 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"The Hornets have pretty much been underdogs since after the days of Glen Rice-- maybe older Hornets fans can correct me on that. Either way, the team we have now is a young group, scrappy as fuck, with tons of high character dudes. Coach Clifford has been a solid hiring and the team seems to like him. Up and down we got a bunch of young talent that, if they gel properly, will not only be fun to watch but a contender in the East. If you want to join the Hive I think this is a great year to do it to see how much our team will mature from last year and grow into themselves."
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,Aurion7,6,Thu Jul 9 05:11:37 2015 UTC,"What are you guys most excited about?   Whatever happens this year is pretty much irrelevant in the scheme of things, as our roster is pretty much going to be wiped clean come 2016-2017 season. Hopefully we have a good showing and develop some of our young talent.   Strengths of your team?   Very good defensively.   Weaknesses of your team?   Not so great on offense, we've been a very weak shooting team, hopefully that changes with the addition of some 3pt shooting this off-season.   Realistic prospects for next season?   Winning record, maybe a 7-8 seed.   Best vs worst case scenario?   Best case scenario: I think we have it in us to win a playoff series for the first time in a while. Worst case scenario: Everything turns to shit and we end up with ~30-35wins and the 9th pick in the draft (again).   What is Coach Clifford's system on Offense?   Slow pace, low turnovers, inside-out. We've been limited offensively in recent years due to a lack of shooters.   What is coach Clifford's system on Defense?   Conservative, single coverage, designed to slow the pace down and force teams into shooting contested jumpers.   What other moves do you want the team to make this offseason or this season?   Would be great if we could find a decent backup/defensive big seeing as we just let ours walk for no reason.   How do you guys feel about MJ/Cho?   I think MJ is starting to settle into the idea that he's an owner not the head coach/GM/president of basketball ops and relinquish some control, although things like picking Frank Kaminsky 9th in the draft seem to be heavily influenced by MJ.  I'm not sold on Cho, he varies wildly from making great moves to doing stuff that leaves everyone thinking ""WTF?"", although hard to say how much (if any) of this is MJ still thinking he's in control."
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,ripkin05,5,Thu Jul 9 05:17:54 2015 UTC,"What are you guys most excited about?   Probably the prospect of having a functional NBA offense. Last year's Hornets were defensively stalwart and offensively unwatchable. Hopefully the moves management has made during the offseason improve our offense without compromising the defense.   Strengths of your team?   Last year, defense defense defense.  This year, wing defense. Without Bismack I'm not sure how precisely we intend to keep people away from the rim, but with MKG, Batum, and Lamb/Daniels/PJ (assuming PJ is retained which at this point may be questionable) we have an incredibly tall/long set of plus defensive players who can play the 2/3.   Weaknesses of your team?   Last year, shooting. I've never seen a team as awful at hitting their shots as the Hornets were this past year.  This year, probably rim protection. The team's basically traded guys who can't contribute on offense for guys who can. We've had something of a problem with acquiring big men who are only one-way guys, especially.   Realistic prospects for next season?   Playoffs. The middle of the East is going to be a bloodbath, since there's like eight teams that could make a case for a 4-6 seed.   Best vs worst case scenario?   Best case the shooters hit their shots which frees up guys like Kemba to do their thing, Kaminsky gets minutes and provides floor spacing from the 4, and we manage to cobble together some big-man rotations that aren't horrible defensively. Al bouncing back on offense is vital as well because if he isn't scoring a lot he's not very useful.  Worst case none of that happens, the team starts horribly again (it's been a trend to start the season in the worst way possible), they flame out of the playoff conversation, and everyone gets fired.   What is Coach Clifford's system on Offense?   He's pretty conservative in general. We might be able to push the pace some more this year thanks to actually having scoring. Clifford's biggest pet peeves are turnovers and poor shot selection. Which is a large part of why Lance rode a lot of pine later in the year, and PJ tends to get buried in the wing rotation.   What is coach Clifford's system on Defense?   Pretty simple stuff. Doesn't ask the guys to do too much, tried to keep teams away from the hoop and force them into taking the dreaded contested long 2. Not the most innovative scheme, but it's a strong foundation.   What other moves do you want the team to make this offseason or this season?   I think we're about move'd out. Charlotte is actually over the cap, and just about all of the roster is at least penciled in. I didn't like losing Bismack, but that ship has sailed and there's not really anyone available to fill his role.   How do you guys feel about MJ/Cho?   That's a bit complicated. MJ's pretty much learned how to be an exec on the job, which lead to a lot of well-publicized hiccups in DC and here. He's overall been a pretty good owner to have, and it really can't be overstated how much he's done to clean up the positively toxic situation left behind by Robert Johnson and shore up fan support.  Charlotte's been kind of tortured by the NBA- first George Shinn abandoned a great fanbase because he was a colossal asshole, then Johnson turned the 'Cats into horribly-run personal vanity project.  Cho is something of a cipher. He gets too much credit for his pedigree (used to be part of the OKC organization, which -let's face it- got incredibly lucky). He's made some good moves and some bad. Still not sure what I think of the current direction of the franchise mostly because it sure as hell looks like his priorities flipped.  Think this is a make-or-break year for him, because he's pretty much gone all-in on putting a competitive team on the floor this year. If things don't work out, there's a high chance the franchise simply hits the reset button. We'll have a lot of salary cap room available next offseason regardless, but so will literally everyone else in the league so..."
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,aceboogieville,6,Thu Jul 9 07:11:22 2015 UTC,Best vs worst case scenario?- best case we make playoffs as the 6-8th seed and we make a good showing. at the same time MGK show more improvements to his jump shot and take a few more steps to becoming a top 10 SF in the nba. Lin and walker work really good together which helps lin become a candidate for 6th man of the year. walker steps up and shows he can become a elite PG in the nba. our 2 big white boys show that picking them in front of higher ranked prospects was a good move which leads to frank the tank winning ROTY. big al does what he did when he first got which was 20ppg and 10 rpg. nicolas batum turns out he likes it here in charlotte and stays longer then the year he has 2.   worst cast- we all get hyped up like we did last year just to get smacked back down to earth again. MGK shows no improvement at all. we get the worst record in the nba but get stuck with the 4th pick in the draft. walker has his worst year in the nba and shows the the extension we gave him turns into a big mistake. nicolas batum turns out to be a great player but says fuck off charlotte and goes to another team for a max deal. lin sits on the bench like he did in LA but this time he is with frank cuz Clifford plays him less then he did with vonleh and we just trade him a year or 2 later. big al goes out with a year long injury and cody does nothing.  How do you guys feel about MJ/Cho?- i dont think MJ is that bad he just needs a GM that has the balls to say no to him.... cho not that kinda of guy  What other moves do you want the team to make this offseason or this season?- i cant believe we made this deal i thought we had no money to give to anyone till next year so im gona say we are all out of moves at this point.  -Weaknesses of your team?- my 68 year old grandma can shot 3's better then we could the last 2 years

CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,deemerritt,2,Thu Jul 9 17:21:18 2015 UTC,i know and it scares the shit out of me.
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,richt519,2,Thu Jul 9 17:55:01 2015 UTC,In the east we can be much better than 6-8 seed. There isnt a shitload of talent outside of the Cavs.
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,HURCN_hugo,2,Thu Jul 9 17:18:28 2015 UTC,To be fair it takes some massive balls to say no to MJ. I think MJ has learned to step back a little and lets the staff run things more. What I do really like about having him as an owner is that I know he wan't to win a championship more than anything.
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,Aurion7,2,Thu Jul 9 21:20:13 2015 UTC,Holy fucking shit. The worst case is was too real feeling. You picture painting fuck
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,leshric,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:05:51 2015 UTC,One of the interesting common denominators in responses is that Clifford runs a conservative offense thats slow paced and post feed heavy - while sometimes running PnR. Thats actually counter to Jeremys strengths so its interesting to hear Clifford sold him on a style he wants to play. Does that mean you guys are going to drastically alter the way you guys run the offense now?
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,Aurion7,3,Thu Jul 9 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"I think Lin will have more or less free reign with the ball when he's in at the point, provided he takes care of it.  One thing that's definitely true, acquiring Hawes and Kaminsky should vastly increase our capacity for pick-and-pop/roll plays. Last year's big man roster just didn't really have spacing except for Marvin Williams and he's pretty limited in a lot of ways. Including not actually being all that good at stretching the floor. Them's the breaks, I guess.  Al's more of a post-up threat, and Cody/Biz were only really dangerous heading towards the rim. Biz's struggles at anything other than dunking are well-chronicled, and Cody -while greatly improved- was still very much feeling his way through.  We have a pretty radically different personnel set up in the frontcourt than we did even two months ago. Also, Batum and Lamb should greatly upgrade our wing play (Hendo was about average but didn't have 3pt range, Lance was a disaster).  All of which is a really long way of saying it'll probably take a bit for everyone to get it nailed down, but I expect the offense to look pretty radically different from what we've been used to."
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,knotswag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:46:39 2015 UTC,"How are your shooters?  Looking through the older threads kemba didn't have a whole lot of decent shooters and possibly had to shoulder more of the load last season? I know there was good defense last season,  but I heard the offense left a lot to be desired."
CharlotteHornets,3cn3qx,Aurion7,5,Thu Jul 9 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"Monstrous post incoming.  Overall should be pretty decent. Might even be good, which will feel like manna from heaven after last year.  Lance set a record for the worst 3pt % (min 100 attempts), Hendo was a 30% 3pt guy, and don't get me started on Brian Roberts. The first two guys are gone and Roberts won't be seeing much of the court ever with Lin on the roster- a complete loss of confidence in Roberts is pretty much exactly why we were pursuing another PG to begin with.  By player.. SG/SFs Nic Batum: Career - 36% from deep. Good shooter, last year his %s dipped to 33 because of a wrist injury apparently suffered in int'l play. Should be ready to go, and his octopus arms promise fun things for unsuspecting wing ballhandlers.  MKG - Non-shooter. His jumper is a million miles better than it was when we drafted him, but yeah. He won't be shooting 3s.  PJ Hairston - Honestly, PJ's a conscienceless chucker and a supreme knucklehead going back to his days at Carolina. He's got a ton of talent, but I just don't think his head is in the right place.  Troy Daniels - Career 38.5% from deep. Former DLeague guy. He was a part of Daryl Morey's mad-scientist shooting experiments with Rio Grande, if you've heard anything about that. Excellent shooter, should see a lot more time with PJ chucking his way to oblivion in the SL and Lance/Hendo out of town.   Jeremy Lamb- Career 34.8%. Hasn't been anything special so far in OKC, but he didn't get to play much in OKC either. Probably most famous for being ""that one guy the Thunder got out of the Harden trade who plays the same position as Harden"". I think getting out from under all that crap will only do good things for him.  Big dudes: Al Jefferson, Cody Zeller - If either of these guys shoots a 3, something has gone very, very very wrong. Al is rarely seen as far up as the FT line even, as he's the current undisputed champion of the NBA post-move world. And he's really slow.  Cody's a young gun with a lot of potential, but not much of that potential is located in his J.  Spencer Hawes - Career - 35%. Not gonna lie, I detested this acquisiton when it happened but it makes more sense in retrospect. Can't defend worth a lick, but not a bad passer at all and can shoot well from the midrange and the arc. Rounded himself from a guy with no outside game into a guy with a pretty damn good outside game in Philly (near 40%) before signing with LAC last year and getting exiled by Doc Rivers because GM Doc is almost as bad at acquiring players that fit as Coach Doc is good at running the tam.  Frank Kaminsky - The guy who'll either make Rich Cho or break him. Kaminsky's game is similar to Hawes' with the caveat he has the potential to a better passer and quite possibly a better shooter/better defender too in the long run. Alternately, he could be a poor man's Hawes in which case he isn't really worth having on an NBA roster. We shall see!  Marvin Williams - Career 34% from deep. A cautionary tale about tweeners, honestly. Marvin can shoot, but he isn't a deadeye guy like say Ryan Anderson which is a problem because... He can't hang with SFs because he isn't athletic enough and he's not strong enough to bang with the real big boys inside. He does a lot of things okayish, but isn't all that good at any one particular thing.  Lastly, from the point, Kemba is wiling to shoot but isn't great at it (career: 31.8%). We'll see if that ticks up, if nothing else he'll not have to take as many bad shots this year- we have leaned on him way too hard in the past due to a lack of offensive creativity. Things were already looking up for him before we brought Lin in, and adding another legit creator will only do good things."

He got in trouble for punching a high schooler at a YMCA during a pick up game.  If someone at the top of the organization, in this case MJ, doesn't have ties to that school, do you think we take a chance on a kid like that?

I'm including Wake, Duke, UNC, NCState and the rest in that.   PJ wasn't a good person, I'll agree.

We aren't the Cowboys and don't have the regiment in place to mold people with issues like PJ.   I absolutely see this move being made across the league, we weren't the only ones interested in PJ and he would have found a home on somebody's squad. Again, at the time everyone was downplaying his off court issues and uplaying his talent and ceiling.  I think the hope was that we could get PJ into the team dynamic and have him mature with our other guys. But he's starting to prove that he might not be able to do that."

PJ has made some promising plays in the summer league and it's promising, then he has things like this pop up and we're questioning if he's made ANY moral progress.

CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,Cubelar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:43:56 2015 UTC,MKG is stronger than Batum so he is better suited to play SF even though Batum is taller.
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,richt519,9,Fri Jul 10 21:46:20 2015 UTC,Kemba bro
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,Willarent17,6,Thu Jul 9 19:02:38 2015 UTC,Kemba
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,thesuspicious24,3,Thu Jul 9 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"The research I'm doing says that Lin should not want to start with the Hornets, Al does not seem to be a good PnR partner.  Kaminsky and Hawes seem to be far better choices."
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,HRenmei,5,Fri Jul 10 01:58:59 2015 UTC,Better assisting? Kemba last two seasons: 6.1apg/2.3tpg 5.1/1.6TO(one of the best A-T ratios in the league) Lin: 4.1apg/2.3tpg 4.6apg/2.6apg
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,Im_Billy_FUCO,2,Thu Jul 9 20:14:05 2015 UTC,"Barring Kemba reaching Lance levels or Lin going back to Linsanity, I think Kemba remains the starter. That said, I hope that Kemba takes Lin over his shoulder as motivation to get better and prove he deserves his contract."
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,Elcor05,2,Thu Jul 9 23:19:22 2015 UTC,Why exactly is Kemba Walker untouchable? Is it because of his contract or ability? Is he an above average point guard? Judging by his stats alone I can't really see it.   What does Kemba Walker do better than lin? I'm not trying to troll I'm genuinely curious. Because he seems to be regarded as a franchise player.
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,Nyanu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"Kemba is just a better overall player than Lin. For most of Kembas career he has been surround by bad offensive players in general and almost no one that could shoot three's. He's had no one to pass to and has also had to carry a large amount of the scoring as well. He's had to jack up a lot of well contested shots over the years so his percentages aren't great. He has handles, speed, and a dirty stepback jumper. Also we have attachment because he's been around the longest and was on the team when we were complete garbage and actually helped us get better. When you finally get a good player you feel like you owe it to him to give him the team he needs to be good."
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,richt519,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:55:59 2015 UTC,He's not a franchise player and his contract certainly does have something to do with him being preferred on this team. But also he is just significantly more athletic than Lin and at least as skilled. His stats have been heavily impacted by a terrible offense around him since he entered the league. Kemba looks better right off the bat but time will tell. He's certainly not proven yet.
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:00:47 2015 UTC,If you are not a troll and this is a serious question please read all 3 of my posts in this thread. I don't want to repost everything here and be redudant
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,Cubelar,0,Fri Jul 10 06:05:19 2015 UTC,This is not even a question.  Don't be blinded by obscene optimism.  Lin isn't nearly as good as people hyped him up to be during his two week span
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,fluffyoyster,10,Thu Jul 9 19:45:29 2015 UTC,Guy who start the thread is not a Lin or Hornets fan. He is a troll.

CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,Buckelroo,-12,Thu Jul 9 20:35:46 2015 UTC,Kemba shoots 39% and 30% from 3 threes.  Decision sounds pretty easy to me
CharlotteHornets,3cpgjf,aceboogieville,4,Thu Jul 9 20:10:10 2015 UTC,"Because he had to carry the burden of the scoring load for so long. Who else was going to take 3s, Henderson? Kemba's efficiency numbers are deflated from being on such a bad team surrounded by lackluster talent. He'll be much more efficient and his assists numbers will go up now that we have more scorers."

CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,imeanYOLOright,20,Tue Jul 7 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"Some notes I took on the game today:  Frank: Frank's shooting ability commands respect. In one sequence he pumped, got his defender in the air, and was able to drive to the hoop for an easy 2. Got to the line twice and looks automatic from the stripe. He also made a nice play on the defensive end, using his smarts and quick hands to get a strip and steal. He was pretty quiet today although he did score 11 points.  PJ: PJ started 3-3 but struggled after that. The ball just isn't falling for him. The good news is he doesn't let it affect his play on defense. He was playing pesky defense all game, sticking to his man like glue and using his size and strength to bother players. His closeout speed on 3 pointers looked good and he even took a charge after missing a 3 on the other end. He had a couple of nice takes the rim, one after a broken play, but the ball rimmed out twice. He looks like he'll be able to guard the 2 and 3 this season. He left the game with 8:22 in the 4th with a shoulder contusion and didn't return.  Troy: Easily the star of the show, again. He is exactly as advertised, a bucket-getting knockdown shooter. Made 4 of his first 5 attempts from 3 and got to the rim a couple times, once earning a trip to the free throw line. He's a willing and smart passer, he found Qvale out of a double team for an easy 2. Decent ballhandling ability, but his lack of elite size and explosiveness makes him easy to stay in front of. Still showed that he's capable of putting the ball on the floor and getting to the rim though. His 3 point shooting is going to draw a lot of hard closes, which will make getting by defenders easier. I know it's summer league but the kid looks like the real deal and like will be a big contributor this season.  Miscellaneous things:  Cobb looks like the guy you underestimate at the YMCA who then drops 40 on you. Small, quick player. Made a few nice plays today.  I saw the concerns about Harrison's defense today. He had some trouble staying in front of the smaller, quicker Josh Gasser, who was able to beat Harrison off the dribble a couple times. Outside of that, I would not be mad if he got a spot on the roster. Learning the PG position is still a work in progress for him, but he's shown flashes that indicate he can become a solid backup. With 3:18 left in the 4th he had a great drive to the rim where he smartly drew some contact and a foul. He missed both free throws, but Qvale got the OReb, kicked it to Harrison who made a nice move to the rim for 2. He then hit a 3 on the following possession to extent the Hornets lead to 8.   Qvale is the epitome of ""tall and that's all."" Doesn't bring much to the table and dropped what would have been a sweet dime from Harrison. He did have 12 boards (7 offensive) today, though.  The ref was JACKED. Absolutely huge. Nobody had any complaints with his calls.  Pat Ewing is not someone I'd want to be on the bad side of. I forgot what exactly happened, but someone did something he didn't like and maaaan was he looking mean."
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,aceboogieville,3,Tue Jul 7 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"I think Pat was angry at what was initially an offensive foul on Brooklyn that got reversed to a foul on Hairston, I think maybe in the first play Hairston tried to take a charge.  Good analysis"
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,net403,3,Tue Jul 7 21:45:30 2015 UTC,"great analysis and thanks for the insight as someone who wasn't able to watch. I'm a huge homer for PJ so really wan't to see him start to play more. He definitely needs to tone down the shots, but I think his defense is definitely under rated. Dude can be scrappy when he wants to be. Stats looked like he did a little bit of everything today."
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,pepesilvia23,5,Wed Jul 8 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"No problem, that was kind of my goal, I wanted to provide something a bit more informative for those who couldn't watch. I am also a huge, unapologetic PJ homer. His defense has been one of the biggest pluses for me this summer. He's shown that when he's engaged, he can be a positive defensively when he's on the floor, it's really been good to see. I just wish his damn jumpers would start falling."

CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,roodypoo926,9,Wed Jul 8 13:33:46 2015 UTC,Troy Daniels is shooting the lights out in summer league
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,schrutebeetfarms,3,Tue Jul 7 21:15:01 2015 UTC,Really hope we hang onto him and give him floor time next season. Looks like a solid contributor that we got for cheap last year.
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,archer4364,9,Wed Jul 8 02:53:43 2015 UTC,I think Frank has shown that he has a good enough handle to put the ball on the floor to create a shot for himself and be more than just a spot up shooter.   Edit: His finesse and small ball abilities are a very underrated part of his game.
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,richt519,8,Tue Jul 7 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pumped after seeing Frank today, post moves!  Everyone that was able to comb through his game and find singular details they didn't like, please begin to register your complaints below"
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,net403,3,Tue Jul 7 21:11:59 2015 UTC,I am very positive about Frank at this point but the love for him and calling out the haters has become as obnoxious as the hate initially was. It's summer league guys. Literally means absolutely nothing in projecting NBA success.
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,BobcatsHornets,3,Wed Jul 8 01:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, I don't see many people calling out haters though so it's nice to have a more neutralized forum with a two-sided convo than one dialog running away with it.  Haters are often the loudest of the bunch, but optimistic supporters are starting to become more noticed though.  I don't intend to call out haters as much as point out the positive aspects and hope posts are less angry lol  I'm not in love with Frank yet but I'm in like with him  P.S that was a passive aggressive swipe at the haters you got me lol"
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,net403,0,Wed Jul 8 01:43:22 2015 UTC,I mean his defense still doesn't look like it has any chance of being good.  It'll probably be good enough.  Just not good.
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,jaynay1,4,Tue Jul 7 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"He can take a number then because that's not uncommon, some of the guys who are good on D their offense is bad so pick your poison.  Cody Zeller was not as good on D his first year, there's gotta be some room to grow.  Even with two good scorers and Defensive liabilities I'm ok with that and I won't even call him out on any Alfense"
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,net403,2,Tue Jul 7 21:49:18 2015 UTC,"Andrew Bogut was known as a weak defender with offensive skillset when he entered the NBA.  Now people think of him more for his defense than his O.  Things change, it's not impossible."
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,Daheixiong,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:39:19 2015 UTC,"efficiency. im hoping itll improve, but he's shooting under 50% so far. granted, he's not getting open looks, but still. gotta go kobe if you wanna succede in our offense. man opening night can't get here soon enough!"
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,dr-doc-phd,2,Wed Jul 8 01:42:39 2015 UTC,Who shoots over 50%? lol  /sarcasm
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,net403,3,Wed Jul 8 01:51:11 2015 UTC,"The big outlier is just how many boards Daniels was able to snag. He has the skills to be a surprisingly decent rebounding G but 14 is still a crazy high amount.  More in general,the last couple of games Daniels has flashed a more complete game that he's really shown before. He's been pigeonholed as a shooter, but in the SL he's doing a fair amount more off the dribble. If he can even be meh at putting the ball on the floor in the longer run that could be huge since it'll pry open the defense on hard closeouts."
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,Aurion7,2,Wed Jul 8 03:20:19 2015 UTC,"one common critcism ive seen, that i have to agree with, frank has been very inefficient through summer league, unfortunately i think this has to do with poor shots and shot selection. both will hopefully improve as he gets into a better system in the regular season, but 4-11 wont be good long term."
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,dr-doc-phd,6,Wed Jul 8 01:40:37 2015 UTC,very inefficient is a bit strong.  Let's try and remember that Vonleh was shooting like 30% or less the whole SL.  Today was the first day I saw that the shots he took were off by more than a good bit.
CharlotteHornets,3cgzzj,Daheixiong,3,Wed Jul 8 09:44:57 2015 UTC,"yeah, this has been the only game where his shooting was inefficient. otherwise, he's looked good."
CharlotteHornets,3cgk39,aceboogieville,7,Tue Jul 7 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"By far my favorite player on our roster. It's almost automatic anytime he drives the basketball and his shot is just getting better and better. I hope he has a bigger role on our offense in the coming years. Charlotte, we might just have ourselves a superstar on this roster."
CharlotteHornets,3cgk39,alyateemwd,2,Wed Jul 8 06:39:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seeing his shot improvement brings joy to my heart. I have faith that he can get that corner three that he's working on with our new shooting coach. I have to think he's the hardest working guy on our team.

You'll probably get someone posting a lin highlight video after every game (win or loss, good game or not for Lin) and a submissions for every Lin FB/twitter post and video he makes.  And a few prickly lin fans.   And as you can see here, there are a few weirdos who follow the guy around trying to stir up trouble for whatever reason.  Oh, you'll also get some alt accounts pretending to be crazy lin fans.  I'd suggest the mods here ban and delete w/o mercy, the real crazy fans and the trolls alike.

I guess its a good thing you're in the East so I can kinda root for Lin's new team without betraying my Rockets :p    edit: and I see the first lin highlight video is already up.

Congrats on picking up Lin and yes, you will get more publicity from this acquisition - I know I'll be watching more Hornets games on LP this year."
CharlotteHornets,3cmkpi,justflop,13,Thu Jul 9 02:42:28 2015 UTC,"First off, would you say on the whole we're more or less persistent than you are? How many posts regarding Lin is this now? Come on, guy, move on.   Second, to keep things in perspective - ESPECIALLY if you take into account the quality of posts at /r/lakers and /r/rockets - there were just as many crazy haters as there were delusional fans.   Thirdly, if you follow /r/nba throughout most of the Lakers and Rockets games, you'd have seen that most posters who made comments about Lin questioned why the coaches of those two teams were so stupidly hellbent on not running any plays that would make sense for a PG like Lin. So unless most followers of /r/nba were Lin Only Fans, what you're saying is kinda biased."
CharlotteHornets,3cmkpi,supjackjack,15,Thu Jul 9 02:06:59 2015 UTC,"Yes there are a few LOFs that are irrational (I personally know a couple), but most are very respectful and peaceful. We just support Lin like any passionate fan would to any athlete / team.   Today, we are all Hornet fans.   And btw, It's not the Lin fans people need to worry about. It's the haters of Lin & Lin fans. They get thrilled by disguising themselves as LOF and generate hostile environment.   Over the past few seasons of struggle as Lin fans, we have been to the rock bottom. We are mature enough to not engage ourselves in certain situations."

CharlotteHornets,3cede8,irrationalportions,9,Tue Jul 7 06:46:42 2015 UTC,"Kawhi, MKG, and Demarre Carroll are in a class of their own when it comes to defensive minded SFs. Iguodala up there too."
CharlotteHornets,3cede8,Imsortofabigdeal,6,Tue Jul 7 13:13:02 2015 UTC,I can't put DMC in the same tier as Kawhi or MKG.  Not since prime LBJ or mbah a moute (artest and battier were slowly on the down) have I been so high on a perimeter defender.
CharlotteHornets,3cede8,richt519,3,Tue Jul 7 14:17:54 2015 UTC,I think part of what makes him so great defensively is not just his outstanding perimeter defense but his versatility too. He can guard positions 1-4 if he needs to so he can switch and rotate like crazy and help out the weaker defenders on the team (which he frequently does because he is always going 110%). This shows it perfectly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUT72HmIttk
CharlotteHornets,3cede8,GoAraJjang,2,Tue Jul 7 20:46:27 2015 UTC,"wiggins will be there very soon, if not there already."
CharlotteHornets,3cede8,aceboogieville,7,Wed Jul 8 09:33:32 2015 UTC,"I'm glad MKG is starting to get some recognition. The best part about him is he's still only 22 years old. That's absolutely fucking insane for a kid to be so young and already so good defensively. His offensive game still has a long way to go but I have faith in our coaching staff and his work ethic. MKG doesn't need to become a primary scoring option, he just needs to become a reliable scoring option. Someone capable of getting you 15 or more a night so other teams can't just completely ignore him.  His jump shot is fixed, now he just needs to get some range on it, something I'm positive he can do in the next 3-4 years. If he ever gets to a point where he can spot up shoot from 3 at 35% or better, I wouldn't hesitate to call him the best 3-and-D player in the league. Even if a 3 point shot never materializes, and solid midrange will still be serviceable of its paired with improved ball handling, as MKG has proven he's lethal when getting to the rim. Sorry for the super long comment, I just get really excited when talking about MKG. The future is so bright for him."
CharlotteHornets,3cede8,aceboogieville,8,Tue Jul 7 17:05:35 2015 UTC,He is a perimeter defender that somehow transforms a bottom ten defense into the best rated defense when he is on the floor. That to me is astounding.
CharlotteHornets,3cede8,jaynay1,3,Tue Jul 7 17:13:48 2015 UTC,"Yup. This comment truly sold me on MKG, aside from everything else we've mentioned. Now we finally have some (hopefully) reliable 3 point shooting and low post scoring to surround him with. I can't wait to see how it all comes together. Clifford and Ewing were on the staff in Orlando when they built around DPOY Dwight and they made it all the way to the Finals. It's still yet to be seen if MKG and be built around the same way, but if it works it could be a lot of fun to watch."
CharlotteHornets,3cede8,Kaendor,5,Tue Jul 7 18:28:46 2015 UTC,"Gordon Hayward and Khris Middleton are both better too if you call them both Small Forwards.  But after that, yeah, he's up there.  He's definitely the best defensive wing in the league right now."
CharlotteHornets,3cede8,jaynay1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think Khris Middleton is even close to MKG, but I would say Rudy Gay is better. MKG is top 8-10 definitely."

CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,zdnorman,10,Tue Jul 7 01:42:15 2015 UTC,No sign-and-trade.  What now for the Hornets? Who are the potential/likely MLE options?
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,imeanYOLOright,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"Jeremy Lin?  The slimmer the choices are becoming the better he is looking, he'd probably have to take a pay cut to come here I think.  Aaron Harrison has not played the PG to just throw him in there and rely on production, that would be bad"
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,net403,8,Tue Jul 7 14:57:45 2015 UTC,So it looks like Aaron Harrison will be the 3rd PG
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,turnertornado,3,Tue Jul 7 01:44:18 2015 UTC,"I hope we give him a contract soon. I'm worried we will wait too long, and some team like the Lakers or Knicks will come in and swoop him from us."
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,jaynay1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:52:56 2015 UTC,"We aren't allowed to sign him before Thursday though, right?  I assume we probably have something in the works already."
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:33:51 2015 UTC,"This could be wrong information.. but according to Rick Bonnell (covers the Hornets for the Charlotte Observer), we are allowed to sign him at any time."
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,caraper,2,Tue Jul 7 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"I doubt we sign him unless he really balls out in the next games. With the focus of all of this offseason's moves being on immediate production and shooting, I would be shocked if we signed an undrafted rookie who had never played point before and isn't a very good shooter. I think Harrison has a future in the NBA but he's not ready this season and third string PG's need to be able to step in for injury help and contribute immediately."
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,theriotismagic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:41:39 2015 UTC,But we can still sign and stash him on our D-league roster. He has shown enough potential to earn a spot and learn a new position. Its not like a 3rd string last year (pargo) got a lot of minutes during the season
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:27:45 2015 UTC,"Pargo would have seen more playing time after Kemba was out, however he was injured and then waived to make room to obtain a PG. During that time we had a combo of Neal and Stephenson acting as the facilitator for the 2nd unit.  A sign and stash would make sense, however we don't have a d-league team yet."
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,buzzbuz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:55:43 2015 UTC,I like him a lot as a strictly d-league player for us. But as our third string point I don't think there's anyway he helps us if Kemba or Roberts goes down. He's likely still be in his rookie adjustment phase whenever the injured player comes back. You need a vet in that role
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,jaynay1,5,Wed Jul 8 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"Damnit, I was really hoping we could package him up as a sign-and-trade and move Hawes/Marv in the process.  If the only moves we have left are to sign an MLE and a bi-annual I don't like the way the roster has shaped up."
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,unclefunkjr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:21:02 2015 UTC,My personal favorite idea was going Hawes + Mo for Haywood.
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,TheFanslator,3,Tue Jul 7 20:34:24 2015 UTC,"Damn so many players are leaving money on the table,  David West and now Mo Williams. Charlotte cant seem to hold onto their unrestricted free agents, Williams, McRoberts, CDR, Mullens.  This is a trend we need to break."
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,unclefunkjr,3,Tue Jul 7 02:21:01 2015 UTC,"The only player in that list worth trying to keep is McRoberts and only because he played well in the system that Clifford created. Apart from that, the players in that list are not worth going out of your way to resign."
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,TheFanslator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:39:26 2015 UTC,Mo Williams was Eastern Conference player of the month when Kemba went down. You don't think he was worth resigning?
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,Dcarnys,5,Tue Jul 7 05:01:12 2015 UTC,Not really. His numbers were inflated last season because he was on two bad teams and got the green light to shoot whenever he wanted. He only seems like a good deal because he's taking a pay cut to play on a contender. He would've commanded a much higher salary to stay with Charlotte.
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,schrutebeetfarms,2,Tue Jul 7 05:09:41 2015 UTC,In all fairness the only one of those guys we were trying to retain was McRoberts and he went with the highest bidder.
CharlotteHornets,3cdhp3,TweetPoster,3,Tue Jul 7 14:27:16 2015 UTC,"Mo Williams played surprisingly well for us last year, but this isn't a very significant loss.  Aaron Harrison is looking like a good candidate for 3rd PG."

CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,aljeffersonphd,10,Mon Jul 6 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"I, unlike you, am a big uk fan and for some reason, unlike most uk fans, I really like Aaron Harrison. I really like this pick up for many reasons. First, being his size. Kemba tends to get bullied when playing bigger guards and having a big combo guard could give kemba a break when facing those big and physical pgs. Secondly, Harrison has all the tools. He's decently athletic, has good form and range on his jumper and most importantly he hustles. Lastly, he isn't timid. He wants the ball in big minutes and I think this will translate to being aggressive in the limited minutes he will get at the start. So many project guys are so timid when they are on the court. Harrison won't have that problem. Regardless if he becomes a backup anything or not, I think a 11, 12, 13 spot on the bench is worth taking a risk on a young guard that could be a contributor down the road. He didn't cost us anything and I like want he brings to the table. Go big blue!"
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,ryanp15,8,Mon Jul 6 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"Does he make poor decisions like Sessions? I mean the kinds that make me go ""No...Sessions no....SESSIONS NO GOD WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT."" Because I don't wanna go through that again."
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,Kaendor,7,Mon Jul 6 19:37:43 2015 UTC,"At this point, I'd prefer him on the roster over PJ. We could definitely use a combo guard that can play the 1 or the 2, get to the rim and play some D."
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,scsmith83,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:58:09 2015 UTC,Harrison hasn't shown he can play d. Give pj another year.  Dude just finished his rookie year where be rarely played although that might have been his fault. How can everyone write him off after one year and two summer leagues. It's ridiculous
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,1234Squad,0,Mon Jul 6 22:11:13 2015 UTC,"Harrison was known as a strong defender in college. He's not lightning quick, but he's got plenty of size and skill that would indicate he could be a solid defender at PG/SG."
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,scsmith83,2,Mon Jul 6 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"I like Jarrett Jack as a better comparison, both large guards who can play the pick and roll. Harrison has the size at the 1 to be considered an absolute steal. He doesn't play games with the ball, makes the easy play, and uses his size and length to fend off smaller guards and be defensively disruptive. He is outplaying Hairston in Summer League, by a country mile. Look for Ewing to give him big minutes at the point for the third game."
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,unclefunkjr,2,Mon Jul 6 20:40:27 2015 UTC,I'm ready to cut ties with PJ already. is that bad? His shot selection is terrible. The one thing he was supposed to be able to do was shoot the 3. which he's shown that he's mediocre at best at doing. Aaron over PJ all day
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,iRipDabs,3,Mon Jul 6 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"Given that PJ is a second year player who hardly played last year, and even then, usually when we were getting blown out, yes, that is short sighted of you"
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,lockeitup,3,Mon Jul 6 22:34:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe don't pull the plug just yet but my hand is on the cord.  He was supposed to show improvement this summer and has not shown much.  I'm ready to move PJ to the end of the bench, he hasn't shown he is anything more than PJ ""Chucker"" Hair-trigger, terrible shots he doesn't need to take with too much time on the clock, repeatedly, even though he misses 70% of them.   Everyone wants hates Frank immediately but PJ is free to run around doing whatever he wants with terrible results, there's little doubt that any time PJ has an offensive possession that it's going to result in anything but a turnover."
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,net403,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:45:07 2015 UTC,"PJ is trying to be a catch and shoot type of player, which at the moment he doesn't have enough capability of doing. Maybe he could be that in another year or two. What he needs to realize is that at his size he can be very physical with a lot of players. If he realized this then he could get to the rim a lot more and become an efficient rotation player for us."
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,ReidM15,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:11:46 2015 UTC,Sessions...hm. Maybe?   Sessions is really only useful for the fact that he's one of the most prolific slashers in the NBA. Probably the most prolific considering his relatively light minute load. At or near the top in drives almost every year. I think Harrison's size and athletic ability could lend him a marginally higher ceiling. I'm especially curious to see how his defense ends up grading out.  I definitely agree with you that anyone touting his shooting needs to go look up his stats. Dude just isn't very good from deep.
CharlotteHornets,3cbnfa,Aurion7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:29:52 2015 UTC,hornets need to lock him up.  he isn't under contract and could walk tomorrow for another team.
CharlotteHornets,3ccxjh,alabatusa,18,Mon Jul 6 22:58:51 2015 UTC,Literally every person named Frank who has played sports has received the name Frank the Tank.
CharlotteHornets,3ccxjh,BobcatsHornets,8,Tue Jul 7 01:05:35 2015 UTC,"Frank the Tank from Old School (no idea why, he probably got really drunk and streaked naked or something)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20g3QIUnOgY  Yes he has been speaking in interviews about working out to add another 5 pounds or so"
CharlotteHornets,3ccxjh,net403,6,Mon Jul 6 23:36:56 2015 UTC,Tank is used the same in America. I think it's more of a rhyming thing (and maybe Old School) than it is that anyone actually thinks he's a tank.
CharlotteHornets,3ccxjh,Elcor05,3,Mon Jul 6 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"It's definitely from Old School he said so himself during the NCAA Finals, because he is a known jokster.  They showed this pic for evidence.  http://espn.go.com/prod/styles/pagetype/otl/20141105_kaminsky/images/h_4.jpg  And Frank the Tank from Old School was known as such because he was a ""drunk tank"" and got really wasted.... so I have to wonder how much similarity there is there also"
CharlotteHornets,3ccxjh,net403,2,Tue Jul 7 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"For sure, it's probably as old as the words Frank and Tank, I was just saying that's just how he says he received it himself, he was like 10 years old when that movie was out, that might make you feel old.  Maybe he can light it up like a tank.  I'm interested to hear some more info get out about why else he is called that though lol"

CharlotteHornets,3ccxjh,net403,4,Wed Jul 8 18:05:59 2015 UTC,"It always amazes me when guys come out from college and then realise they need to bulk up and gain some muscle. Like I kind of understand for the one and done guys, but if you've played college ball for 4 years like Frank there's no excuse for not coming into the league with an ""NBA ready"" body.  As for whether or not he needs to hit the gym or not, I think it depends where we are going to play him. I think if they want him to play at the 4 mostly he'll need to add about 5-10lbs I guess, if he's going to be seeing time at the 5 (I know he isn't very long, but I think he might be more suited to the 5) then I'd really like to see him add more like 15-20lbs which means he needs to be hitting the gym straight away."
CharlotteHornets,3ccxjh,buzzbuz,3,Wed Jul 8 19:09:10 2015 UTC,hell I didn't play anything and I still bulked up in college. 4 years of an all-you-can-eat cafeteria and campus gym in walking distance makes it easy if you care to at all.

CharlotteHornets,3ccxjh,richt519,0,Tue Jul 7 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"This post is rediculous. I seriously can't even take it serious.    Blokes skinny and seems 0 athlete.

This might be the most obvious shit post/troll post/ Frank bash post of the whole off season.

For comparison, Justin Winston (who's that guy?) in games 1 and 2 shot with similar efficiency from the field but on fewer shots, but no where near the rebounding and 3 pointers  4/8 and 3/10 field goals  1/3 and 0/5 from 3  0 and 5 rebounds  Frank has better looking stats but haters gonna find a way to hate hate hate anyway"
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,aeiou_sometimes_y,3,Mon Jul 6 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"I think they've both looked good, but in different fashion.  Winslow hasn't done much spot up shooting, while Frank hasn't done much of anything near the rim.  He needs to improve in his post up game in order to take advantage of good match-ups come season."
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,Battmans_Hooters,2,Mon Jul 6 03:06:13 2015 UTC,I haven't seen him get any touches in the post really. Might be the nature of summer league

Blah blah Winslow is the 2nd coming.

CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,khangiskhan,2,Mon Jul 6 17:18:16 2015 UTC,Frank looks abysmal on D.....that being said we didn't get him for defense. His stroke looks legit from the 3 point line and his mid range jumper is great as well. Of course it's summer league and everything is slowed down a little but if he can find space this could end up working out really well for the Hornets.
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,Battmans_Hooters,2,Mon Jul 6 12:35:05 2015 UTC,"He reminds me of K-Love. Except he's not nearly as good a rebounder or strong enough to post. I think Kaminsky can be a good player. But he doesn't have much potential from what I've seen imo.  I'm still upset over the pick and don't understand it along with the Vonleh trade, but I do think Kaminsky has an old-man game that once he bulks up and can work in the post he'll be even more valuable. Plus he'll probably be around for a long time since his game doesn't revolve around athleticism in the slightest. He'll age like fine wine, it was a safe pick but I really don't think this organization needed a safe pick we neeeded someone that had potential to be an amazing player, Kaminsky won't be that, but he'll still be a good guy and good player as he can find a way to deal with more athletic 4 and 5s"
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,Battmans_Hooters,5,Mon Jul 6 13:24:54 2015 UTC,The only way Charlotte ever gets out of 10-8 seed territory is if they draft a franchise talent.  Safe picks are the last thing this franchise needs. Maybe Jordan just couldnt handle another year of missing the playoffs...
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,Battmans_Hooters,2,Mon Jul 6 13:52:22 2015 UTC,Yep I agree with you. And we had either had a prospect with a lot of potential or a heaping load of picks fall right into out laps. I'm not sure if Kaminsky will ever show he was worth that pick
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,richt519,2,Mon Jul 6 13:57:21 2015 UTC,It was the number nine pick.  I think he is capable.  This isn't a top 5 pick you know.
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,Battmans_Hooters,3,Mon Jul 6 14:03:35 2015 UTC,Yes but we had a fringe top 5 talent fall into our lap and a possible trade worth up to 4 or 5 future. That means the player we pick needs to perform like a top 5 talent and prove he was worth more than the picks. Kaminsky shouldn't have been put in this position but the front office forced him into it by not making the smart decision. I don't hate picking him at 9 I hate the circumstances surrounding it.
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,deemerritt,3,Mon Jul 6 14:21:20 2015 UTC,"Explain to me, besides what you've read about Justice Winslow in mock drafts, how he is certain to be a top 5 talent.  I mean, truly, most people somehow feel like GMs were watching completely different workouts, and practices, and games than we were.  How do you explain all the prospects who were picked anywhere 1-10 in the past that ended up not living up to their spot, or either being busts?  I'm not defending Frank because so far there is nothing to defend.  Neither is there for Winslow.  He was not a top 5 pick if he fell.  He was a top 10 pick."
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,aceboogieville,2,Mon Jul 6 15:01:18 2015 UTC,"I said fringe top 5 which means 5-7. He lead his team on the way to a national title with great two way play defensive intensity and athleticism. In a league where small ball is taking over a versatile defender that disrupt  the wing positions is a big need for many teams, perhaps not for the Hornets, but did we need a big man that can shoot either? Kaminsky had a better collegiate career and season that Winslow, that's irrefutable, however you don't draft based solely on the production in college, but what you think the player will become in 3-5 years. Now if you agree that Winslow and Kaminsky are even close in current talents and value they bring to their team, then I don't understand how you don't take Winslow. He projects much better in a more important position than Kaminsky. Kaminsky is already 3 years older than Winslow, so he's likely done growing where as Winslow could still get taller and fill our his frame. Winslow is a much superior athlete, Kaminsky is a relatively poor athlete compared to various others at his position, speed and strength are super important when measuring potential and Frank doesn't have the athletic ability or even the size  to matchup against 5's athletic 4's or even large and athletic 3's where Winslow will be likely be capable of that by the time he turns Kaminsky'a age. Kaminsky was a four year senior meaning his game is more polished coming in indicating there is less room to grow compared to Winslow's game. Winslow also looks to have a better feel, court vision, and passing ability than Kaminsky already. Of course Winslow could be an absolute shit player, so could Kaminsky, nothing is a known value, but Winslow was a much more coveted around the league than Kaminsky was meaning that if you pick him and don't want him you could easily trade him to another team, have them pick Frank, and then get something else in return. Winslow is also better for the org. because he'a more marketable, he just brought Duke a title and is playing for the NC NBA Team at least some of the fanbase would tune in to see him. I get trying to defend picking Frank, and people make it seen like Winslow will be a sure fire superstar, he probably won't be, but he does have a ton of potential to be a good two way player, where as I haven't seen much desirable out of Frank besides shooting stroke, which is great, but he can't make his own shot, won't be able to overpower even smaller players, isn't a tenacious rebounder, won't be able to defend size or speed extremely well. He may later be able to handle size and post up players which would be fantastic and exciting, but I don't see how he develops anymore than into a solid offensive player that will struggle to make his shot against more athletic bigs."
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,Battmans_Hooters,2,Mon Jul 6 15:52:36 2015 UTC,You don't always choose you're draft picks based on what they will be 3-5 years from now. We are in win now mode and picked accordingly. Gameplans can be changed depending on who is on the board when you are picking but clearly the front office didn't think Winslow was a sure enough thing and I would tend to agree (I think he's pretty overrated but we'll see). I think he is also just a bad fit for the team because we don't really need any more wing defenders with questionable shooting strokes. We were one of the worst 3-point and scoring teams in general last year and Kaminsky addresses that team need better than Winslow.
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,deadflow3r,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"Why the shit are we in win now mode? We don't get anything but a middle of the road draft pick when we start competing for a first round exit whoopin next season. Winslow was a back up shooting guard at the least a position we needed. Kaminsky is a stretch 4/5 with poor defense, which we did not need. If we wanted to keep a stretch 4 I don't even know why we traded Vonleh then since he at least has the athletic potential to be a good defender and great rebounder, albeit probably a poorer shooter than Kamisnky, but not by much. We have the stretch big filled in spades with Kaman, Zeller is also at the 4, as well as Al who is all offense and poor defense. I'd rather us have taken a dynamic player who has a chance of sucking hard but also a chance of being a sensation rather than nearly a known value in Kamisnky, who would be a great fit on a team like Washington or something, who needs rotational players to get over the next hump, and just be a 7-8 first round exit. Plus we needed someone to bring buzz to Charlotte. Frank ain't gonna do that, Winslow, at least I thought, had a chance to that."
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,net403,3,Tue Jul 7 03:39:14 2015 UTC,Those Boston picks are completely worthless to an NBA GM. There is a good reason Boston cant even give those away.
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,deadflow3r,2,Mon Jul 6 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"Kaminsky is just as much of a fringe top 5 talent as Winslow is. There were reports close to draft night about the Knicks considering taking him at 4, and that a number of other teams were trying to trade up to get him. Frank was the best player in college basketball last season and outplayed guys who were drafted higher than him. People keep talking about his lack of a ceiling but he's only 22 and extremely polished already. He's only going to get better."
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,net403,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"He was the best player in college basketball last season, but that don't mean shit now. He's not going to play against kids he can bully and raw talents that don't know the game as well as he does. He's going to be playing against seasoned athletic freaks of nature who. He was polished by college standards, but his defense is sloppy, he can't post anyone really, and he's show the tendency to turn the ball over if he gets it in the post and struggles to pass out of it well. He's not going to become a Kevin Love, he's not as athletic, he's not going to be a Dirk, his shot isn't good enough. He could surprise, sure, but it isn't likely from everything I've seen thus far. I still don't hate picking him at 9, I hate picking him when we have a clone Kaminsky in Hawes, and give up on a position of need such as Winslow or a bunch of picks that were offered."
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,LordHighSummoner,3,Tue Jul 7 03:30:53 2015 UTC,If Frank can hit threes with the same percentage in the NBA like he is doing now the pick makes all the sense in the world for this year. That's a big IF though when the caliber of talent it's ratcheted up to 100 like it will be in the NBA vs. SL.   Everyone will laugh but I honestly think that we have been making some of the moves in order to get Steph next year. I mean Steph is Charlotte first and through his Dad he may have already committed to coming home. If you think of it that way some of these moves start making sense.
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,unclefunkjr,3,Mon Jul 6 14:56:18 2015 UTC,"The people complaining about Charlotte needs shooters and we can't hit 3's are the same ones complaining that we drafted Frank, one of the better shooters in the draft that does exactly what we need.  That was a bad pick, but no one mentions that we didn't need to draft an undersized wing that struggles shooting.  Amazed people hated Frank before Winslow even fell to us.  Frank is already what Cody has shown no interest in being, that's awesome, I'm not displeased, and you're right I'm excited to see what happens in real games now against serious competition."
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,G_Thirty,2,Mon Jul 6 15:12:15 2015 UTC,Everyone seems to also still be in love with PJ...who has been mostly a disaster shooting and looks like he took a few steps back right now in the SL.
CharlotteHornets,3c99kb,net403,3,Mon Jul 6 15:14:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, everyone wants to hate Frank, and PJ has a free pass to suck because he's from UNC.  So far he has had 1 successful shooting season in his playing career surrounded by terrible ones.  I'm ready to give Aaron Harrison his spot and Troy Daniels behind him, park PJ in a suit and wait for a trade.  He spent all summer bulking up to the size of a Tight end and obviously no time at all on his basketball IQ"

CharlotteHornets,3c99hr,dr-doc-phd,3,Mon Jul 6 16:55:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking since we've got our sweet new brand, and have made the necessary improvements to our arena so as to host All-Star Weekend in 2017, that if we're winning some games we might actually have a chance.  Like I said, it's unlikely, but I'd be thrilled if we got one; it's also unlikely that Frank becomes Dirk 2.0, but if so, a 2015 Christmas Day Kaminsky jersey would be a dope thing to have."

CharlotteHornets,3c88ob,Dhalphir,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"It's fucking bizarre too, because his shot LOOKS gorgeous, it just never goes in."
CharlotteHornets,3c88ob,imeanYOLOright,6,Tue Jul 7 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"I thought Aaron Harrison looked pretty good today.  Although he's not exceptional at anything, but did a great job of playing to his strengths and exploiting the size advantage over his opponent.  He's not a great (or really even good) shooter, but did well finishing at the rim and was a pretty decent passer.  I think he's given himself a fairly legitimate chance of making the roster.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, PJ played atrociously (4-14 FG, 2-9 3P) and doesn't appearance to have improved/changed at all since last year.  I wonder if he's ever going to realize he outsizes practically every defender he faces, so he's better off driving the basketball rather than pulling up from 25 feet about 90% of the time?  Frank Kaminsky had a quietly good game (14 PTS, 8 REB, 2 BLK).  He didn't touch the ball all too frequently today, but generally did something positive when he did.  The most optimistic part is that he did an improved job on the defensive end and really didn't look like a liability.  The way he's played so far, he'll definitively be able to serve an immediate role from day one.  Daniels was the best player on the floor today.  He shot lights out (7-12 FG, 6-9 3P) and played a fairly complete game in all other aspects as well.  I don't know if he'll crack the rotation this season, but I'm excited about his play.  He's not necessarily a good enough distributor to play as a traditional PG or big enough to play as a traditional SG, but works well when paired with a bigger ball-dominant guard (like Aaron Harrison today).  As for everyone else, I doubt anyone has a legitimate shot at sniffing the NBA roster."
CharlotteHornets,3c88ob,Tbuckelew,11,Sun Jul 5 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a new Hornets' fan, and used to wonder why PJ didn't get more playing time. After two summer league games, I get it. Sorry for doubting."
CharlotteHornets,3c88ob,aceboogieville,3,Sun Jul 5 20:48:53 2015 UTC,Please. It's two bad games. He could easily come out and drop 20 next time they play. Don't put too much stock into these summer league games.
CharlotteHornets,3c88ob,bp-man,3,Mon Jul 6 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true, you can ignore good offensive and defensive play because at most only 3 or 4 people are the team are actually good enough to play in the NBA. But you can read into bad performance for the same reason, especially bad shooting. I wouldn't jump to conclusions yet but PJ has not had a good two games."
CharlotteHornets,3c88ob,Buckelroo,2,Mon Jul 6 01:29:36 2015 UTC,Isn't inconsistent shooting and poor shot selection his major issues? Or are these problems unique to summer league?
CharlotteHornets,3c88ob,1234Squad,6,Mon Jul 6 01:43:56 2015 UTC,Aaron looked pretty good to me. He made some mistakes on the pnp but that one hesi he had with a frank pnp was really nice. He waited for the big to commit then drove to the hole. Looked lost on d mostly but he's long so hopefully practice will iron that out. Didn't shoot well as expected. Frank looked really good. Much better game. Played within the offense really well and didn't seem to force anything. Really hope we sign aaron at least to keep practicing with us   Edit: changed pnr to a pnp

CharlotteHornets,3c8nqn,Elcor05,3,Mon Jul 6 05:28:23 2015 UTC,If it happened in the past few years it would have been a great trade. But then Chandler had some injury issues and Brown didn't really play him much even when he was healthy >_>

CharlotteHornets,3c59bz,paulzors,2,Sun Jul 5 07:07:10 2015 UTC,I wouldn't expect Dirk level from him. We didn't see anything from him inside the free throw line. Dirk has a much higher release point for his shots. I can easily see a SF or PF with good timing blocking a lot of his shots. He releases way too low for a 7 footer....but I'm excited that he can learn a lot and continue to progress with PE as his big man coach.
CharlotteHornets,3c59bz,matroe11,2,Sun Jul 5 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"Dirk in his rookie didnt impress much, then blossomed in subsequent years. Believe kn the Wisconsin Dirk."

CharlotteHornets,3c59bz,syowsers,12,Sun Jul 5 01:05:56 2015 UTC,"Fine. Inefficient shot selection for most of the game outside of the 3rd quarter, especially in the 1st half. Missed his assignment or switch or hedge on a number of plays, especially on a couple of pick and rolls where he was late. 0 assists for a guy we touted for his passing ability.  Happy now?  In all seriousness, I was pretty happy with what I saw from Frank, and I think the defensive issues will be fixed by Coach Clifford, I don't think he'll be any worse of a defender in our system than McBob was. Shot selection will change for the better, especially once he's surrounded by actual NBA caliber talent (Frank was, arguably, the only NBA level player on our team today. PJ Hairston, Aaron Harrison, and Troy Daniel were mostly unimpressive and often simply stunk)."

CharlotteHornets,3c5m52,1234Squad,4,Sun Jul 5 00:58:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I don't know if he's really quick enough to guard your typical NBA PGs. And if he can't shoot that well, and has never been much of a slasher...well, you can see where its hard to figure out what sort of value Harrison can actually bring."
CharlotteHornets,3c5m52,skadoosh0019,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"And if he can't shoot that well, what are you talking about? This dude has hit more clutch shots for Kentucky this past year alone than most players hit during their entire careers. 3 Buzzer beaters, 59 threes this past season, this guy is a sleeper pick up and the Hornets want this guy to succeed. 6'6"" with a smooth handle, he freaking hustles, and can hit an open jumper. I like his odds of signing a contract, if he has one break out game in summer league he will look like a steal."
CharlotteHornets,3c5m52,unclefunkjr,7,Sun Jul 5 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"He only shot 31.6% from 3 this past season. That's not particularly good from the college 3 point line. In fact, I'd argue part of the reason we kept freaking out about all the buzzer beaters the past 2 tournaments was because they were ridiculous anomalies occurring over and over again, because he doesn't normally hit them (although, for what its worth, I think nearly all of them came from his strong side. He is WAY better from the left side than the right.) We shall see, I don't mind Harrison and if he becomes a steal for us I'll cheer just as loud as anyone, I just don't know that he's quite good enough for the NBA.  I can't find his 2014-2015 shot chart yet, still looking. Here's 2013-2014 though.   And Nylon Calculus' interactive shot chart, also 2013-2014. Just select Aaron Harrison to use."
CharlotteHornets,3c5m52,skadoosh0019,2,Sun Jul 5 03:19:29 2015 UTC,"Stats, once again, don't tell the whole story. This guy came to Kentucky as a starter and then got his minutes cut down tremendously due to the amount of talent that's brought in yearly at that school. If you use last year as your only basis of his shooting it's going to come back with poor results. But he's a clutch shooter and can play."
CharlotteHornets,3c5m52,Sinestro1982,7,Sun Jul 5 15:07:23 2015 UTC,59 threes   On... 187 attempts. That's actually not even vaguely impressive.  He was 62/174 as a Freshman (35.6%).  He'll have to improve a lot to be a good NBA shooter. Serviceability might well be his ceiling.

CharlotteHornets,3c4z8b,psychonaughties,8,Sat Jul 4 21:00:49 2015 UTC,Man PJ was so disappointing today. His shot selection is fucking absurd

CharlotteHornets,3c4z8b,therealjgreens,6,Sun Jul 5 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"Besides Franks and-1, his post game looked shaky, but it's the first summer league game. He just needs to adjust or put on some weight."

He's going to learn a lot from here on, that's what this league is for anyway.  I'm pretty satisfied he was the best player on the floor, which probably puts him better than half our roster already.  He looked capable for it being his first NBA competition game.  I think its up from here, he a'ready runs circles around Alfense, which is not saying much lol  Fuckin Hairston, he is obviously better at other things than choosing and shooting 3's. He needs to lay off, he single handedly killed the teams 3 %"

CharlotteHornets,3c4dst,net403,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:09:46 2015 UTC,"Sure. Biz's main value is rebounding and rim protection, but he's pretty athletic/mobile as well.  A little undersized for a true C, but he's long and he has real hops.  About the only thing he really does on offense is set screens and catch the occasional lob/rim-roll though that's common knowledge."

CharlotteHornets,3c4yez,LocksTheFox,6,Sat Jul 4 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"Frank seems to have a little rust on his shot (as noted by Bonnell the other day), but even still he was by far our most dominant player and I for one, am pretty freaking excited by how he looked. Kept up with Mitch McGary on the boards, which personally I think is quite an accomplishment. 7/19 from the field but 4/8 from 3 (making him our best shooter of the day by far) to be the high scorer for the game with 19. Didn't see much of his vaunted passing ability but he didn't turn it over really either.  I am a little worried that we're still going to be a little rough on the bench shooting. PJ Hairston, Troy Daniels, and (potentially) Aaron Harrison did not exactly inspire confidence that they're going to be giving us much production from deep. 0/5, 1/5, and 1/6 on 3s respectively.   Brian Qvale had a good game. Other than that, I don't know that anyone else on the roster even possibly matters for us come regular season, and even he and Aaron Harrison are doubtful in that regard."
CharlotteHornets,3c4yez,skadoosh0019,7,Sat Jul 4 21:17:23 2015 UTC,No way Qvale ever even sniffs a legit shot at an NBA roster. He's a stiff that cant catch a cold. His one quality is being big and trying
CharlotteHornets,3c4yez,HPUpirates,2,Sat Jul 4 21:35:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. Still, being big is often enough of a quality to get in the NBA, so I wouldn't completely put it past him to make it onto a roster as the 13th man somewhere."
CharlotteHornets,3c4yez,skadoosh0019,2,Sat Jul 4 21:39:27 2015 UTC,"That's the first time I ever saw him and he obviously cannot handle the ball or any pass coming his way, he did good on offensive boards keeping the ball alive but then loses it out of bounds nearly every time hes targeted."

CharlotteHornets,3c4yez,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"PJ and Troy are too good of shooters to shoot that poorly consistently. They'll be fine. It's one summer league game, which is pretty much irrelevant in the grand scheme."
CharlotteHornets,3c4yez,aceboogieville,7,Sun Jul 5 00:14:54 2015 UTC,"Troy, yeah. PJ I'm not so sure about. He only shot .300 or so last year on the 3 ball, and post-All Star break it was only about .240 from deep. Even at UNC his nearly .400 from deep sophomore season was in contrast with his .273 freshman year. His shot has always LOOKED fantastic, but the results are not always stellar."
CharlotteHornets,3c4yez,skadoosh0019,3,Sun Jul 5 00:31:17 2015 UTC,"I am super happy with our shiny new toy frank but completely put off by PJ showing hardly any improvement at all, still a chucker that can't hit the ocean from the beach, and it still didn't stop him from taking far too many attempts.  At this point I'd rather see him taking lay ups and short range shots"
CharlotteHornets,3c4yez,net403,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:13:52 2015 UTC,"Frank looked pretty bad in the first half but he was probably still adjusting. Caught absolute fire in the third quarter. The D clearly focused in on him in the 4th which opened up good shots for other guys but they 2012 bobcats'd that shit. Rough D but McGary is big even by NBA 4 standards so if that's what him at a disadvantage looked like it shouldn't be too much of a concern. Overall solid start for him.   Otherwise, PJ and Daniels were exactly what we all know them to be. Nothing new there."
CharlotteHornets,3c4yez,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:15:31 2015 UTC,"Some good, some bad.  Kaminsky flashed good shooting and rebounding. Shot selection was a bit meh, but the third quarter was encouraging.  Iffy recovery/rotations on defense, had real trouble handing p&r play. Adjusting to the speed of the game is a common problem when moving up a level in any sport, if he can develop better anticipation it should mitigate the lack of quickness. Given that it's summer league that's mildly concerning because it'll only get tougher from here.  I'd like to see a bit more playmaking, but with the way PJ/Daniels/Harrison were shooting it wouldn't have mattered who got them the ball.  As for the other guys...well. PJ stunk it up and I wasn't real impressed with Harrison. Daniels looked uncomfortable. PJ's only real highlight was a pretty fade. Looked like the same guy as last year, and last year he looked like the guy who was a pretty meh/bleh wannabe chucker for Carolina before Roy went small in 12-13.  e: The most surprising thing may have been remembering that Jonathan Wallace exists. Apparently he's been playing in Germany?  I'd have been just as happy not being reminded, considering his role in the '07 Elite Eight game."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,DaveyBaby27,17,Sat Jul 4 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"Great defensively, fantastic rim protector. Mediocre at best offensively, sloppy hands, not a great finisher. His attitude and personality are top notch however.   I worked for the team last season, and he is legitimately one of the nicest pro athletes I have ever met. Very humble and easy to like/support. I hope he does well for you guys."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,TheLordTrolldemort,6,Sat Jul 4 18:08:05 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity in what capacity did you work? How was it? And how hard was it to get said position? I'm sure some of us would love to hear about how possible or impossible it would be to work for the Hornets.
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,skadoosh0019,3,Sat Jul 4 18:28:27 2015 UTC,"Working in sports (not for the Hornets) can be a very low paid thankless job. Yeah we can chill and work with pros all day but they are just people.   With that said I love my job but it took years of dedication and tons of luck to get it. Unless your parents have money and know someone, that is.  All and all it depends on what you wanna do."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,Cmoore4099,6,Sun Jul 5 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"Heard a story when he was injured this past season in Chicago walking the streets he met a homeless man, and started talking to him and took him out to dinner.  http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nba/charlotte-hornets/article11624369.html  Very good story.  Super great guy, just wish he was better at offense"
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,net403,6,Sat Jul 4 18:16:48 2015 UTC,"Hands of stone. Don't expect Biz to catch the ball on a difficult pass (such as a pick & roll pocket pass or a tough pressured entry pass) Offensive scoring repertoire extends all of about 6 feet and is extremely limited. Dunks, layups, and he's added in a somewhat useful short hook shot. No countermoves, no spins, nothing like that. You will not nor do you want to see Biz dribble the ball. Ever. Great screener though. Despite the fact that Biz represents neither a pick & roll nor pick & pop threat, he still gets guys open off of his screens because he sets REALLY good screens. Defensively very solid. One of the league leaders in blocks per minute ever since he entered the league, can clean the defensive glass, long arms, strong as an ox, pretty quick and mobile too. This is why he got picked #9 overall, dude is an athletic freak with a good feel for the defensive end of the floor. Fantastic attitude, great locker room presence, you guys will fall in love with him off the court. IMO, Biz is EASILY worth $3 million a year. He will instantly become your best defensive player inside, and its not like the Raptors employ an offensive system like the Hawks or Spurs that requires well-rounded players who can catch and pass and put the ball on the floor from every position, so he shouldn't hurt you too bad there. You will instantly improve defensively and on the boards when Biz gets on the court. The key is whether your offense can still function while he's out there."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,skadoosh0019,2,Sat Jul 4 18:24:29 2015 UTC,Given that he was picked #9 would you characterize him as a bust or is what he is essentially what people were expecting from him when he got drafted in the top 10?
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,skadoosh0019,5,Sat Jul 4 18:28:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, he definitely never developed into what we were hoping for. I think the hope was essentially for a Serge Ibaka type player, that you could develop the non-existent offensive game from a clean slate and it would turn out well. Didn't happen, mainly because I don't think anyone realized just how bad his hands really were.  Still, I hesitate to call a player who is now an NBA rotational player who dominates in certain aspects of the game (rim protection and rebounding for Biz) a bust. Just never became a complete player, that's all."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,MechaZain,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly it. He's elite defensively and If he could play a shred of offense he would be a great player, he just never got there with us. Instead he's a role player that doesn't fit in Charlotte's scheme anymore.  Trust me, we know busts."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,turnertornado,4,Mon Jul 6 18:55:10 2015 UTC,"He got hyped up way too much after he had a triple double at the Nike hoops summit, should have been picked in the 15-25 range."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,rutherford2212,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:27:05 2015 UTC,What was the third column? Assists or blocks? Because 10 blocks seems nuts and I couldn't see Biz making 10 assists!
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,turnertornado,2,Sat Jul 4 20:33:16 2015 UTC,12 pts 11 rebs 10 blocks
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,net403,2,Sat Jul 4 20:46:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely somewhere in between hah  Not a bust cuz of his D, but definitely not anything near what was expected on draft day"
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,Aurion7,2,Sat Jul 4 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"Role players aren't what you're looking for in the top ten of the draft, so by that standard he's been somewhat disappointing. He's still extremely raw in terms of basic offensive skill, he had practically no real basketball experience prior to the draft.  Biz isn't a bust- he may only be a defender, but if he isn't elite he's very close to it with a lot of room to still get even better. Just not a star."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,DJTet,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:24:04 2015 UTC,"He was actually drafted #7 as we didn't want to take a chance to lose him to the Pistons.  Left the Pistons with a choice between Brandon Knight and Kemba.  Kemba went 9th.  Yes, I would have to characterize Biz as a bust, but there's still time for him to be a role player in the league."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,Hornets_r_us,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:18:38 2015 UTC,"he was picked ahead of Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, and Jimmy Butler... I think it is fair to say he is a bust."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,psychonaughties,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:21:52 2015 UTC,"any neutral observer would call him a bust. you don't let a top 10 pick walk away for nothing if they aren't a bust.   that said, zach lowe called him a potentially great FA value. I wanted us to pick him up for the $5 M qualifying offer, so $6 M for 2 is a good deal.   oh, and no one knows how old he is. if he is truly the age he's listed, then he can still develop into a good PnR finisher, a tyson chandler type. no one in the NBA thinks he's his listed age though, again per zach lowe. and if he's 25 or 26, he's probably not going to develop.   tldr - yes a bust, but a good value for you and a potentially great one if he's his listed age"
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,turnertornado,3,Sat Jul 4 20:39:36 2015 UTC,"You're going to love him. Always hustles, great at catching lobs (can't catch anything else however), fun put back dunks, great defense and of course bizSMACKS that make children afraid to play basketball."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,schrutebeetfarms,3,Sat Jul 4 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"He was a personal favorite of mine because he seems like a really cool person. Doesn't have much to do with on court performance, but I will always root for him (#biznation).  He is an absolute freak athletically. Great wingspan, great jumping ability...he has the tools to be a fantastic defensive stopper.  His issue is on the other end. He has terrible hands. He can't dribble. He can't shoot. It's like playing 4 on 5.  He is quite good at uncontested dunks though."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,aeiou_sometimes_y,3,Sat Jul 4 18:16:02 2015 UTC,Poor man's ben wallace
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,collinnc,3,Sat Jul 4 21:11:20 2015 UTC,"Defensively strong, which is what the Raptors are looking for from him so I think $3m a year is a good deal. He averages something like 1.5 blocks, double digit boards, and 5/6 points a night. Hustles hard which is something fans/coaches/teammates like to see. He plays longer than his height, which is due to his enormous wingspan. His finishing inside the paint did improve last year, but he will miss easy finishes inside from time to time, and his mid-range game is non-existent. Not an intelligent player, you learn to expect things like goaltending from him. His hands are pretty bad, and when you see him dribble more than once you start to get nervous. He is a non-factor in passing out of the paint to create looks. He will never be a great offensive player, but he is only 22 so he will continue to develop.   He's an incredibly nice and humble guy, I highly suggest reading the article that /u/net403 posted in this thread. I guarantee he will not be bad for your locker room and will never be in the news for a negative reason. Scroll his twitter feed, and you can see his life outlook is amazing. He's so positive and thankful to be where he is every day, and I think a lot of that is because how far he's come in life from the Congo. He's a fan favorite in Charlotte and many of us love Biz and are sad to see him go. I am certainly rooting for him, and wish him all the best in Toronto. #BizNation for life."
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,cook_mons4,2,Sat Jul 4 23:19:39 2015 UTC,"So question here, can he create his own shot. Does he play the 4 spot?"

CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,Aurion7,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:07:46 2015 UTC,what position does he play?
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,scsmith83,3,Sat Jul 4 19:11:01 2015 UTC,center
CharlotteHornets,3c4ez5,TubaMike,2,Sat Jul 4 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"Let's see... he's undersized for a center at only 6'9, but he has long arms and very good athleticism. The length and athleticism makes him a much more imposing rim protector than the height may indicate. He's most comfortable defending near the rim, but he can chase 4s around a bit. His defensive awareness is a lot better than it was when he entered the league (looked flat-out lost a lot), but there's still some room for improvement; at time he'll just swipe at everything near the rim regardless of whether or not it'd be a goaltend.  Extremely good rebounding chops- in addition to his physical attributes, he's a hard worker.  On offense, he's incredibly raw. Never really had any basketball experience prior to the NBA, and it shows. He can't put the ball on the floor at all and isn't a passer or shooter. Generally, his role on offense is to snag passes headed towards the rim and set screens (something he's actually quite good at). His hands are still a bit shaky, so he's generally better plucking the ball from the air than corralling a tough bounce pass under pressure. Pretty good scavenging instincts though, he'll snag a putback every now and then."

CharlotteHornets,3c4qlp,schrutebeetfarms,4,Sat Jul 4 20:34:56 2015 UTC,"If a first round pick looks good, then that's to be expected and you can't learn much from it. If a first round pick looks bad, then there might be a problem. Vonleh, for example, was horrible in last year's summer league. Maybe he'll still turn out to be a good player, but that was the first red flag for me."
CharlotteHornets,3c4qlp,unclefunkjr,3,Sat Jul 4 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"The only thing to notice is that Frank the Tank has NBA range for days. Mitch McGary had his hands full, because Frank can legitimately space the floor. The only major take away from Summer League is seeing if Frank's shot has some consistency, and also the Harrison twin is really hustling for a roster spot."

CharlotteHornets,3c4qlp,net403,2,Sat Jul 4 20:07:19 2015 UTC,"It doesn't mean everything, it certainly doesn't mean nothing either.  This summer league team looks better so far than last years.  And Frank looks better than Vonleh did if I remember correctly. So I take Frank's performance as at least promising and basically what you would want to see at this point.  If people should be disappointed in anyone (after game 1) its PJ, for every frank bash there should be 2 on PJ, he still believes he is a catch and shoot guy and I don't think he's ever been that on this team"

CharlotteHornets,3c4qlp,net403,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:17:49 2015 UTC,"Yea tons of people if you look over comments here, partly because he's from UNC.  The announcers always say nice things about his abilities even when he is bricking shots, ""That guy can fill it up!"".  After last season he couldn't even crack the lineup of a bad team in the East, and him showing little improvement in Summer league, a lot of people seem to be getting skeptical."
CharlotteHornets,3c4qlp,knotswag,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:37:09 2015 UTC,"I think it matters more for the players that have a year of NBA experience under their belt. If they're not performing solidly-- and I don't necessarily mean stats but in terms of being comfortable on offense or defense-- then I think that's a huge issue cause it means you can't execute and didn't learn during the year you had.   For the rookies just coming in, it's a crap shoot and doesn't really matter either way-- good players during summer can wind up shitty and vice versa. For the new kids what matters is that they're hustling and giving an effort."
CharlotteHornets,3c4qlp,jaynay1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:43:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure that's the case.

CharlotteHornets,3c4qlp,Aurion7,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"If a player struggles in summer league it's generally a very bad sign. There can be exceptions- some guys try to expand their games in the SL. It's a more lax environment than ""real"" NBA competition of course so some guys just aren't made for that.  If they do well, who knows? Sometimes it means something, sometimes it means absolutely nothing."

CharlotteHornets,3c1eek,aceboogieville,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:58:05 2015 UTC,"Charlotte Hornets looking to sign and trade Mo Williams (via At The Hive)    The Charlotte Hornets current front office has never been a group to shy away from trades, and it looks like they're already working on another one. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports, the Hornets are currently looking at doing a sign and trade with current free agent Mo Williams   Charlotte has shown a strong willingness to use its free agent guard Mo Williams in a sign-and-trade, league sources tell Yahoo.  — Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojYahooNBA) July 3, 2015   Williams, acquired at last year's trade deadline for Gary Neal, is a solid backup scoring guard that's unlikely to stay with the Hornets. Despite his solid play with the team last year, Williams is more interested in signing with a current contender than he is in helping Charlotte become a playoff team. His years around the league surely has gained him a reputation as a great locker room presence, and his play on the court is still at a high enough level that teams have no problem bringing him on to strengthen their point guard depth.  With Williams so likely to leave, it makes sense why Charlotte would want to try and receive what they can for him in a trade. It's always better to receive compensation in a trade instead of letting him walk for nothing. The problem is the Hornets have absolutely no leverage in this situation, and this limits the kind of players teams are willing to send them. Charlotte would have to be open to receiving pieces other teams don't want anymore, or are just trying to dump off for the cap space to bring on Williams. That said, Charlotte could use a backup point guard, and it wouldn't hurt if they traded Williams for a backup point guard that another team just doesn't have a use for anymore.  All of that said, this hasn't ruled out the possibility of Williams returning to the Hornets. If he's unhappy with what he's being offered elsewhere, and there's mutual interest between him and Charlotte, then a return is not out of the question."
CharlotteHornets,3c1eek,unclefunkjr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:41:08 2015 UTC,"The Hornets need to hold onto Mo Williams, we need a solid backup pg and he fits the bill. Any trade involving Mo Williams is probably ill advised. He is arguably best backup pg in the East, behind Reggie Jackson. He may want to play for Cleveland, but he likely wont leave for the a single year deal and veteran's minimum, which the luxury tax paying Cavaliers can only afford to spend."

Considering the season ending we just witnessed, the draft was arguably one of the HIGH POINTS of the whole year lol  This sub deserves some kind of drama award with some of the comments after/about the draft  Yes absolutely to all the things you listed, we added new promising position skills, we are without a doubt better right now than in April.  Yet still some people will go ""but what about neglecting the future!"", I agree with you also that we are not strictly limited or disabled for 16/17 season either and haven't reduced the value of our positions at all, definitely haven't ""blown"" anything up!  I'm metric fucktons more optimistic right now than I was a month ago and we haven't even finished free agency yet!  I'd lay money next season is going to be better than the last, and the next probably at least as good.  And oh yea, PJ has no where to go but up, right?"
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,net403,7,Thu Jul 2 16:11:47 2015 UTC,I'm with you man. Bringing in Batum and Lamb has done wonders for my confidence in this team. I'm also a huge believer in PJ. My bold prediction for the 2015-2016 seaso: PJ Hairston wins the 6th man role and averages 12ppg on 40% from 3.
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,aceboogieville,4,Thu Jul 2 16:54:05 2015 UTC,I dont know about that prediction haha.
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,aceboogieville,7,Thu Jul 2 16:56:52 2015 UTC,"It's blind hope mixed with irrational optimism, with a dash of homerism. I'm a huge UNC fan so....yeah. Lol."
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,net403,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"He needs to get serious, if I can make criticisms from outside looking in.  His attitude was kind of upsetting at points this season, sort of expecting to walk onto the line up because he's from UNC, not showing up to practice, being late to practice.  If he starts acting like a professional and taking it seriously he may improve markedly.  Start looking for ways to make players around him better rather than chucking 4 out of 5 at a 30% clip.  I'm a UNC fan too and was a big supporter coming into the season.  Outside looking in"
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,TheCarolinaPanthers,5,Thu Jul 2 18:02:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you, respectfully of course, as to when people had to be talked off a ledge.   The way the draft unfolded was not the way that many people envisioned it, especially with the Winston/Johnson circle-jerk that was going around months prior to the draft.   But I don't think the angry reactions were because of the draft, or rather, the anger after the draft wasn't an isolated incident.  To me it seemed like a last straw sort of thing. Terrible season, with MKG being the only bright spot. Trading away Lance, for Hawes. Making that Batum trade, which was essentially trading away the 9th overall pick and Hendo for Batum. Then you have Winslow on the board, rumors of a trade, and the Kaminsky pick.   Sports is a very reactionary thing. Results are needed now, not tomorrow. Because our teams are supposed to compete now. We watch the game because we love it yes, and we love our team because they represent us yeah? But they need to win. And while we aren't ""experts"", we definitely can look at something and go, ""Uh, I don't think that makes sense.""   Now when you add alcohol into the equation, ""Uh, I don't think that makes sense."" Turns into ""THE END IS NIGH!""   But yeah, we are better in April, and I think if everyone improves just a skosh, we could make some noise in the playoffs, and surprise a few people. But we definitely need some improvements from our players."
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,net403,2,Thu Jul 2 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"I would agree that 'The straw that broke the camel's back' is extremely appropriate here because of the light-weight nothingness of a piece of straw, compared to the major abuse sustained before, being able to break an entire backbone just by falling upon it lol  The 'strawness' of the last event only adds to the irony for me of the breaking of the entire back, obviously.  Especially since it could ultimately be viewed through the lens of team history as having been effective.  And again I submit the question, who the fuck is Justin Winston?!?!  Guess I'll never know lol"
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,TheCarolinaPanthers,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:52:09 2015 UTC,"Whoops, eh you know what I mean, I said it right the second time.   But yeah, we haven't had any real success ever here, so when people say ""have faith in the FO"" there's a big ""why should I"" that gets thrown back. Which I think is understandable."
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,deemerritt,2,Thu Jul 2 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"If we are healthy we make the playoffs. On paper we are better than the Celtics, Nets, and Bucks. I think people are forgetting that we were going to make the playoffs in spite of how shit lance was and how injured we were until Cody got hurt."
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,BobcatsHornets,5,Thu Jul 2 19:31:05 2015 UTC,Bucks could improve a lot because they are adding Monroe and basically a potential star in Jabari too. They have top 5 east talent. Their spacing may undermine their talent though.
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,Hornets_r_us,5,Thu Jul 2 20:09:16 2015 UTC,Bucks look good. Real good. Boston is a push. We might be better than the Nets (I like their Rondae pick).
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,YonderYonder,2,Thu Jul 2 19:32:11 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget, Batum came here on a contract year also, and with his down year last season he will have to put up big numbers to make the money he probably wants. He gets the chance to change from being the 4th option in Portland (Lillard, Aldridge, and Wes) to a top option here, if he wants it enough. If he has a huge rebound year, he and MKG could be a beautiful wing combination."
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:44:37 2015 UTC,I am also looking forward to seeing Kemba thrive with our new additions. We FINALLY can stretch the floor a little bit and give kemba (and Big Al) room to work. I think he has been hindered so much by who we had starting with him the whole time he has been here.
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,Aurion7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:45:52 2015 UTC,I'd be shocked if we didn't get our first playoff victory in the modern era. Baby steps at least. I'm excited for this year for sure. I'm nervous about after that though. We'll have a ton of cap space in next season's free agency money raining parade but a lot of teams do too. We are betting hard that we can deliver in that free agency.
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,daspaceman1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:11:36 2015 UTC,The biggest thing is to start well. We cannot afford another horrid stumble out of the gate.  It's tough to overstate just how draining playing catch-up for 60 games each year is to a team's mentality.
CharlotteHornets,3bvtot,Titanstheory,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"I think next year will definitely be an improvement, and going into this summer and the Draft I was very optimistic about our potential pick and signings. However signing Kaminsky was a huge letdown and as far as Free Agent signings go it is not looking very bright. I do like the trade for Batum and am looking forward to him in a Hornets jersey but I've learned not to get hopes to high during the offseason as a Hornets fan."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,syowsers,21,Fri Jul 3 01:41:34 2015 UTC,"he's young with a ton of potential he's fun to watch  elite perimeter defender always goes 110% great in transition (both offensively and defensively) really improved his jump shot and free throw shooting improved finishing at the rim hard worker in practice and most importantly he's just a nice guy. good in the locker room, doesn't cause any problems.    edit: 10. and go look at charlottes record the past two seasons with him on and off the court"
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,turnertornado,29,Fri Jul 3 02:16:09 2015 UTC,2014-15:    W/ MKG  = 27-28    W/o MKG = 6-21  2013-14:    W/ MKG  = 35-27    W/o MKG = 8-12
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,Baladorf,9,Fri Jul 3 03:25:46 2015 UTC,this is really all that needs to be said to people doubting his impact on our team. That is a huge difference
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,BobcatsHornets,8,Fri Jul 3 04:27:18 2015 UTC,"That's a bingo.    Clifford said MKG might be our most important player.  MKG might not be the alpha wolf like Kemba or the first offensive option like Big Al, but MKG really ties the team together."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,TubaMike,4,Fri Jul 3 05:19:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for this"
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,sal5994,4,Fri Jul 3 11:47:33 2015 UTC,"These numbers also show that he misses on avg 20+ games per season. I see him as a role player on a championship caliber team, and a solid building block on a team at the Hornet's stage, but not a max deal player on any team.  I would be shocked to see any other team offer him a max contract if he were to become a FA."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,Cubelar,6,Fri Jul 3 14:45:01 2015 UTC,"At MKG's current developmental stage he would be a role player on a championship team, however he is only 21 years old and could easily develop a better offensive game. To put this into perspective Draymond Green is currently 25 and was drafted when he was 21. In those 4 years Draymond developed an offensive game to go along with his defense to make him a max player. MKG has all the tools and work ethic to do the same, He could easily get the max after this year if he shows a continued offensive improvement, He's gotten better on offense every year he's been in the league and his rebounding has improved markedly as well. This last year was the first year Clifford really trusted him enough to play him late in the 4th and the confidence from the organization and coach can only benefit him.  I could see a prime MKG being the best or second best player on a championship team, maybe not the #1 option but still leading the team with his defense."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,Cubelar,13,Fri Jul 3 15:31:43 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUT72HmIttk  This video showcases alot of MKG's strengths on defense. DeAndre gets free on the pick & roll and MKG is there in the paint to help. CP3 gets the ball on the 3 point line and MKG closes out and denies him any space with his length. Ball gets to Blake and MKG is there matching Blake's strength and slapping the ball loose.  Simply an amazing defensive possesion
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,BobcatsHornets,7,Fri Jul 3 03:59:12 2015 UTC,"MKG is one of maybe two or three wing defenders in today's NBA that can impact a whole defense at the same level as an elite rim protector.  This allows us to fill the center and power forward spots with strong offensive players who may be bad at D. That's a rare and very valuable type of player  Also, he did fucking work in that video. Jesus."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,Stank3,2,Fri Jul 3 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, who are the others, would you say?"
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,psychonaughties,2,Fri Jul 3 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"Kawhi Leonard, Tony Allen, Andre Iguodala, Lebron if he wanted to, Draymond Green, Chris Paul"
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,alabatusa,5,Fri Jul 3 18:08:30 2015 UTC,Who else can we love in Hornets?  Well now with Biz going... If only he could have improved his offensive game.
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,WhatisReddit101,3,Fri Jul 3 02:22:20 2015 UTC,What about Kemba?
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,Elcor05,3,Fri Jul 3 06:57:08 2015 UTC,"I want to love Kemba for being a scrappy underachiever, but it is hard to love a score-first pg who isn't great on D or at shooting 3's. For me at least."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,WhatisReddit101,2,Fri Jul 3 08:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have been a fan of Kemba's since his UCONN days and was so excited that we were able to get him. We have seen flashes of his potential, now we just need some consistency I think."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,kr0kodil,3,Fri Jul 3 08:25:41 2015 UTC,"Kemba needs spacing. Unfortunately the other 2 fixtures of the team the past 2 years, Big Al and MKG, are terrible for spacing as they aren't threats outside of the paint. The Hornets have tried to make this triumvirate work with a stretch PF and a SG with range, but they've had a lot of trouble filling those roles.  Hopefully Kaminsky and Batum are the answer to the spacing woes."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,1234Squad,4,Fri Jul 3 18:16:37 2015 UTC,Guys why is he being downvoted? He asked a legit question and was very appreciative with the answers?

CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,KingMontagu,3,Fri Jul 3 18:12:33 2015 UTC,"Percentage-wise was our best midrange shooter last year, presumably will continue to improve his jumper since he is an incredibly hard worker. Can finish at the rim and hustles harder than maybe anyone in the league. Does everything else good or great also."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,psychonaughties,2,Fri Jul 3 01:55:49 2015 UTC,He's a subpar ballhandler though. Can't create off the bounce yet.
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,kr0kodil,2,Fri Jul 3 18:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Zeller suffers from a similar problem. Both guys have lots of athleticism but the only way they get to the rim is on cuts or the occasional transition basket.  Hopefully better spacing helps MKG and Zeller reach their potential."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,net403,3,Fri Jul 3 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"He's also one of the only players that gets us any national attention.  Media even recognizes him as an elite defender.  His offense is a work in progress, but just between 2013/14 and 2014/15 he made huge improvements to go from below average shooting to above average.  He doesn't have a 3 shot in his repertoire yet but hopefully he will show some of that this coming season.  Absolute tenacity on plays that helps drive the rest of the team. With him on the floor our win percentage goes over 500, without him it nose dives.  The successful January run we had, had a lot to do with him being healthy, as did the terrible end of the season had to do with his injury.  You could call him the gem of this organization, undoubtedly special talent, and exciting to watch."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,net403,2,Fri Jul 3 02:01:32 2015 UTC,Would it be incorrect to say he is a good comparison to Draymond Green?      e: But significantly worse shooter
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,buzzbuz,3,Fri Jul 3 02:44:59 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be an unfair comparison, aside from the shooting.  I believe if he played for a more successful franchise he would have for sure been in the Defensive Player of the Year discussion, that was mentioned many times here.  I'd say maybe he could be in the top 5 or so.  People that recognize him definitely give him honorable mention.  He is so young, Dray is 25, MKG is 21 and already so good, he is going to flourish into something like that in the next 2 years I'm sure."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,BobcatsHornets,3,Fri Jul 3 03:09:56 2015 UTC,"He missed a few to many games to seriously in contention for DPotY, and yes there's always the question of how successful the franchise is.  I think he got robbed for All-Defensive Second team though. But I think that's a function of how voting occurs rather than anything else, but you have guys like CP3 and Jimmy Butler making the All-Defensive teams even though MKG finished higher than them for DPotY. Go figure."
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,net403,3,Fri Jul 3 04:09:07 2015 UTC,"i even chalk that up to games missed. I can't really argue either he missed almost 30 games. Still, when healthy he transforms a defense as a whole."

CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,net403,3,Fri Jul 3 03:36:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the shout out! I appreciate you spreading the word about my work.
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,kr0kodil,2,Fri Jul 3 10:55:32 2015 UTC,"Any time appreciate for your efforts, just spreading the MKG support, you already covered a lot of it pretty well in the articles so there may not be much more to add"
CharlotteHornets,3bxw12,Aurion7,2,Fri Jul 3 14:06:02 2015 UTC,"I mean, MKG's career TS% is higher than Green's. He is a better free throw shooter and he knocks down midrange shots at a higher clip. Green can hit 3's, which makes him the better pure shooter, but I think the idea that MKG is a terrible shooter is a little overplayed.   MKG's shot is really ugly and he had that season 2 years ago where he lost all confidence in his jumpshot. But last year he hit 40% of his jumpshots and 70% of his free throws, both right around league average. Put MKG in an uptempo offense and he'll get plenty of baskets on cuts. He's not as bad on offense as people make him out to be."

CharlotteHornets,3bw94x,davidoffbeat,2,Thu Jul 2 17:58:50 2015 UTC,What other strong pushes could we possibly do? we offered the MLE and now it's up to him to decide. Bellini is seeing all these huge contracts and is waiting to see if he gets one. We have to be patient.
CharlotteHornets,3bw94x,Cubelar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"Well last year we made a huge deal about Hayward (http://www.newsobserver.com/incoming/otou7x/picture7230344/ALTERNATES/FREE_960/EGOwy.So.156.jpeg), even though there was a very low chance that he came here.   But I didn't mean strong push with Marco specifically, just thought we'd hear more rumblings or rumors."
CharlotteHornets,3bw94x,davidoffbeat,2,Thu Jul 2 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"Well Hayward was a max offer, you roll out the red carpet for those. This is just an MLE. You don't hear any other rumors because the MLE and the bi-annual exception are the only two plays we have. I think they're waiting to see who they get with the MLE before they use the bi-annual."
CharlotteHornets,3bw94x,Cubelar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:15:05 2015 UTC,Well we can't really offer a stronger option than the MLE. We just don't have the cap for it.

CharlotteHornets,3bw94x,ElVacaDiablo,3,Thu Jul 2 17:49:12 2015 UTC,Belinelli might just be waiting to hear from other teams after the big names have all been signed
CharlotteHornets,3bw94x,Cubelar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:06:48 2015 UTC,We were. We offered him the MLE but understandably he wants to wait to see if he gets a bigger offer. The Warriors also offered their MLE which is less than ours.
CharlotteHornets,3bw94x,net403,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"I think we are just waiting for Biyombo to not receive any qualifying offers so we can offer him a discount contract, since we don't have much asset to offer any attractive free agents other than the 5.4 million MLE.  We haven't got much to offer Marco other than begging and pleading and being buddies with MJ lol  Coming to play for this team right now is a hard sale without big money to offer.  Any smooth-talking sales pros out there that could get a job in the FO? lol  There are several other desirable targets out there, worst case scenario we get Bis back at discount or we stay put where we are, I'm still not displeased.  Almost positive they will find a backup PG somewhere before it's all locked in.

That would be lucky if we could resign Bis for 2.2 million, not sure they have much left to offer other potential FA's"

CharlotteHornets,3brtia,turnertornado,9,Wed Jul 1 18:42:16 2015 UTC,Also Hawes. He would no doubt command a bigger contract on the open market. His contract is not the abomination many seem to think it is
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,Cubelar,5,Wed Jul 1 21:17:49 2015 UTC,"agreed. amir johnson just got 12 mil a year, hawes at 6 mil definitely isnt that bad"
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,turnertornado,2,Wed Jul 1 21:24:28 2015 UTC,Hawes was good with us in Cleveland before signing with the Clippers. I think he'll be good for you guys now that he has a strong defensive team around him.
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,completelygibberish,2,Thu Jul 2 13:41:39 2015 UTC,I remember fans around the league laughing at Hornets for Al getting 14mil per year? You have to pay that for a 4th option in this free agency
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,praise_the_hankypank,4,Thu Jul 2 08:12:59 2015 UTC,"Al's contract was before the cap spike. The current contracts are going to happen during the cap spike. Big difference.   That said, he earned it his first year. Last year? Not so much."

CharlotteHornets,3brtia,Tbuckelew,8,Wed Jul 1 18:21:21 2015 UTC,Compared to what other contracts are going out today it's still a whole lot for a role player
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,BobcatsHornets,3,Wed Jul 1 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Especially a system-based player. I read somewhere on /r/nba that nearly 90% of Carroll's buckets were on assists on the Hawks, from a team that ranked the highest in assist %. And the raptors are like, the third worst %assist or something."
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,Dhalphir,2,Thu Jul 2 03:35:16 2015 UTC,exactly. I get that small markets gotta overpay and especially one in Canada but that is just so much for a role player who was never more than serviceable before playing on a team that was special at sharing the ball
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,BobcatsHornets,14,Thu Jul 2 03:47:57 2015 UTC,"We only have 18M guaranteed on the books for next year. We're gonna be spending big next year  Possible MKG, Batum & Cody extensions"
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,Cubelar,7,Wed Jul 1 20:22:43 2015 UTC,shouldn't we be in talks with MKG on an extension this offseason? Lillard and Davis are getting theirs and Kemba got his last year so this would be the time. I haven't heard anything and I would bet we can sign him for less now than next offseason as an RFA.
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,BobcatsHornets,2,Thu Jul 2 03:50:03 2015 UTC,It probably would be smart to lock him up sooner rather than later. It's also possible MKG and his agents want one more year to show how much he's improved for a bigger deal. If MKG makes an offensive leap similar to how Butler did in his 4th year he would worth the max
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,Cubelar,3,Thu Jul 2 10:57:06 2015 UTC,"would love mkg and batum extensions (well assuming batum fits like expected). and who knows what we'll do at center, but it'll definitely involve lots of that cap space im sure."
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,YonderYonder,9,Wed Jul 1 20:39:27 2015 UTC,I'm just waiting to see Belinelli's name come across the wire with our name attached to it.
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,Johnny_Mo88,3,Wed Jul 1 22:23:59 2015 UTC,He'd guarantee watchable basketball for us next year and that makes me want him so bad
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,BobcatsHornets,6,Thu Jul 2 03:53:04 2015 UTC,I was looking at payrolls a few minutes ago (these #'s were updated before free agency began) and Charlotte's was top 5 and I believe third overall. That makes me sad.
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,BombSquad123,7,Wed Jul 1 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"well yeah we have almost all of our roster spots full already (and dont have big name free agents that we are trying to re-sign), unlike most teams. next season ours drops a lot though."
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,YonderYonder,5,Wed Jul 1 18:57:21 2015 UTC,I can really follow your analogy! So then.... the solution is to get drunk faster?
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,net403,5,Wed Jul 1 18:48:05 2015 UTC,"Nah, just sit back and watch other people make poor decisions"
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,schrutebeetfarms,3,Wed Jul 1 19:15:55 2015 UTC,New gameplan for next off-season: Be a salary dump.  Apparently it's pretty lucrative to pray on desperate teams frantically looking to shed salary.  Sam Hinkie robbed the Kings blind.
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,imeanYOLOright,3,Thu Jul 2 04:03:25 2015 UTC,"I JUST SAW THAT TOO.  RATHER THAN BEING JUST A DUMP, WE CAN BE A SALARY DUMP!  But I was looking at our options next year, we have a smaller cap room than previously anticipated. We have to pay MKG and hope to re-sign Batum. Even with the increase in the salary cap, we might not have enough room to sign another max player...  WHO AM I KIDDING! WE ARE NOT GOING TO SIGN ANOTHER MAX PLAYER! HAHAHAHHAHA  Hold me...  Just kidding. I have hope."
CharlotteHornets,3brtia,zacka77ack,9,Thu Jul 2 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"We're also one of the grossest drunk dudes at the party.  The pathetic dude who has already thrown up on himself and it's only 9pm.

CharlotteHornets,3brtia,Johnny_Mo88,3,Wed Jul 1 18:27:21 2015 UTC,Yeah this might be a year where playing the trade market instead of the free agency market is smarter.  That or Cho is trying to invoke some gettlemagic and not get involved in first day free agency scrums.

CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,pyates13,11,Wed Jul 1 20:39:32 2015 UTC,He's putting together a decent looking team this year and has set us up for a spending spree next season so I'm not going to complain.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,turnertornado,6,Wed Jul 1 20:48:14 2015 UTC,It's weird -- it feels like he's taken a series of suboptimal moves to get us to a better place than before.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,jaynay1,12,Wed Jul 1 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"He's not universally hated.  There are a vocal few that I never see here on the boards during the actual season that are screaming ""fuck Cho"", ""Fuck MJ."" etc.  He's never been a perfect draft, i'll give him that, but his ability to trade away junk for silver has been quite redeeming, and while Al had a bad year last year, he's been our biggest FA signing in years.  So no I don't hate Cho, and most steady going /r/CharlotteHornets subscribers don't either."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,Daheixiong,10,Wed Jul 1 22:25:54 2015 UTC,Saying fuck cho or whatever on /r/nba is free karma for some reason. All of his moves are justifiable.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,deemerritt,5,Wed Jul 1 23:05:29 2015 UTC,"I'd describe them as justifiable but not necessarily coherent.  If it's about the 2016 cap space to pair with future assets, why take on Hawes' contract and give up Vonleh?  If it's about the next year, why not re-sign Biyombo?  Like there is a situation in which each move makes sense, but I'm not sure there's a situation in which all of the moves make sense."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,jaynay1,5,Thu Jul 2 01:59:29 2015 UTC,Hawes contract is tiny compared to what other role players are getting.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,Daheixiong,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"While I agree that 6 million is going to mean nearly nothing, it is still something.  If he wanted cap space in 2016 he'd have kept Lance."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,jaynay1,3,Thu Jul 2 03:04:00 2015 UTC,"Everyone has cap space in 2016 and 2017. Something like 26 teams can offer a max next year. Cap space next year has zero value. Check out Zach Lowe's story from earlier in the week for more. I think what happened is Jordan decided that he wanted a winner this year, and he wanted Kaminsky, and Cho did his best to give him both. So they shop their young ""talent"" in Vonleh and Zeller and dump Biz. I don't think MJ has the patience for a rebuild."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,psychonaughties,-1,Thu Jul 2 06:33:17 2015 UTC,Lots of team sources have said that lance was disliked on our team and pretty much a locker room cancer
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,deemerritt,2,Thu Jul 2 03:27:22 2015 UTC,I haven't actually seen anything reliable saying that. All of those players are gone in a year anyway under this hypothetical scenario so who gives a crap if they struggle to get along with Lance?
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,jaynay1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:35:55 2015 UTC,Biyombo would not be a win now move.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,deemerritt,2,Thu Jul 2 03:27:47 2015 UTC,"He absolutely would be in the sense that if we want to win next year specifically, he would be basically the only FA of any value we would be able to add."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,jaynay1,10,Thu Jul 2 03:34:55 2015 UTC,"He's neither been good enough to be lionized or bad enough to be fired. A lot will depend on how Frank pans out and whether or not we retain Batum beyond this year.  Probably the worst strike against him is Lance, and let's be realistic: everyone thought Lance was going to be a great add because talent would win out. Acquiring Hawes was questionable, but acquiring Al was excellent even if this past year he struggled.   Drafting Kaminsky wasn't exactly ideal. Flipping a thoroughly average player in Hendo and a potentially great but unproven guy in Vonleh for Nic Batum has a chance to either look inspired or utterly retarded depending on how things work out.  So...we shall see!"
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,Aurion7,19,Wed Jul 1 23:37:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's been too bad, i mean we DID make the playoffs 2 years after having the worst season of all time. I feel like a lot of fans forget this. I know it's the eastern conference but a turnaround from worst of all time to playoffs in 2 years is a huge leap. Sure last year was not what was expected but we've had a taste of the playoffs and it's entirely possibly that we will exceed expectations this year  This year is probably his make or break year since he made a bunch of moves towards the win now."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,Cubelar,13,Wed Jul 1 20:46:40 2015 UTC,Last year lets not forget that literally all of our starters missed games.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,deemerritt,10,Wed Jul 1 23:00:23 2015 UTC,LOTS of games
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,skadoosh0019,5,Wed Jul 1 23:30:32 2015 UTC,Not to mention any way you look at it we have become a better team. We're pretty much right back to where we were coming off our playoff year looking for a good shooting guard to take the next step. Except this time we got Nic Batum instead of Lance and our young guys have another year of improvement under their belt.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,richt519,4,Thu Jul 2 02:23:36 2015 UTC,"Rick B just mentioned the other day that if you listed the 5 guys who were our ""Starters"" last year, they actually started 9 games together. If you expand that to the top 7 ""starters"" they started 14 game together.... that's absurd."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,I_am_not_angry,-1,Thu Jul 2 12:44:43 2015 UTC,Well the Bucks were one of the worst teams two years ago and made the playoffs this year so I wouldn't say it's that rare
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,glass_dalmatian,15,Wed Jul 1 21:37:06 2015 UTC,They were not even close to as bad as the 7 win team...7 wins man.  And we were historically bad.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,Daheixiong,10,Wed Jul 1 22:23:35 2015 UTC,I think there's a difference between being a bad team and being the worst team in the history of the league.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,MilleniosIV,5,Wed Jul 1 22:24:14 2015 UTC,"Well first of all the Bucks were a bad team while the Bobcats were the worst team in NBA history.  Second of all the Bucks turnaround was a 1 year turnaround, and you are underrating just how rare their turnaround was. Their 26 win turnaround has only been done 11 times in NBA history before them.  Let me quote an article to show you just how rare it is   Their 26-game climb has been duplicated or exceeded only 11 times in NBA annals, and a valid case can be made that they achieved it more collectively than any of their predecessors.  Virtually all of those previous 11 teams benefitted from the addition – by draft, trade or return from injury – of at least one current or future Hall-of-Famer.   So there you have it, the Bucks did what only hall of fame players are capable of"
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,Cubelar,4,Wed Jul 1 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"Or Jason Kidd.  He did a great job coaching there, as much as it pains me to admit it."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,asher1611,8,Thu Jul 2 03:05:09 2015 UTC,"We are headed in the right direction, and to his credit, he's not had very much help from the coaching staff.  He signed Jefferson.  Jefferson then made 3rd-team all nba in a year where he was run ragged, obviously being played more minutes than he could handle.  Jefferson hobbled through the playoffs in a series that foreshadowed his durability for the following season.    He picked Zeller over Noel, which I personally think is his most questionable move so far.  I was literally jumping up and down when Nerlens fell to us, and I had been a Cody Zeller fan throughout his tenure at IU.  Nerlen's, to me, was the obvious choice then and is clearly the better pick in hindsight.  To Cho's credit, Zeller still oozes potential, and in his own right, still has a chance to become a big time player as well.    With three moves in consecutive years, he turned Corey Maggette's expiring contract into a 26 year old Nicolas Batum.  Maggette was originally swapped for Ben Gordon and the 9th pick.  In the next year, he drafted Noah Vonleh which, as you know, was flipped for Nicolas Batum and Gerald Henderson's expiring contract.  When Kemba got hurt, he traded Gary Neal for Mo Williams, and Mo averaged 17 a game for us during a stretch where we fought for a playoff birth.  Although the Lance move didn't work, the contract he signed was enticing enough to be moved for Spencer Hawes and Jeremy Lamb, who both figure to get some heavy burn in the rotation this year.  You may be upset about the Kaminsky pick, but I don't think Cho traded for Batum with the intentions of letting him go after one season.  If Batum is the long-term solution at shooting guard, then picking Justice Winslow seems a bit redundant, especially factoring the loss of Noah Vonleh and choosing not to re-sign Biyombo.  Kaminsky is a true 7 footer with great footwork, court awareness and basketball IQ.  We drafted a 23 year old, who is much more suitable to step in and grab minutes than 19 year old Noah Vonleh.  Choosing to not bring back Taylor & Biyombo gives us a little roster flexibility, and this offseason is no-where near  final.  I am elated with Cho's ability to bend, and his wreck less perseverance."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,Glydedrex,5,Thu Jul 2 07:00:51 2015 UTC,"Well put. I agree with all but one of your points. I actually do think the coaching staff has helped Cho out. Bringing in Clifford was a great move. With his defensive schemes, we became one of the league's elite defenses. We also went from a historically bad season to a season where we ended with a winning record and trip to the playoffs. Last season was very disappointing, but I can't put that all on the coaches. Another piece to consider is assistant coach Mark Price, who managed to fix MKG's goofy shot mechanics.  Aside from a few questionable draft picks, he's done a good job of managing talent. Especially for a small market team."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,theriotismagic,6,Thu Jul 2 12:01:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think any serious Hornets fans really hate Cho, but he and MJ are easy scapegoats when we need to vent.   IIRC, Cho was sent packing from Portland because of an ownership change or something of the sort and Cho's personality didn't fit in.   The NBA lottery is pretty much a crapshoot for most players.  Bismack was a little risky but made sense at the time (and we had an extra pick for sure thing Kemba). MKG is turning into the player he was supposed to be.  It is too soon to tell for The more recent picks to say for sure, but try all have potential.   Cho has made some solid trades that really worked out for us - McRoberts, Mo Williams, and hopefully Batum/Hawes/Lamb.   The Lance signing was a mistake, but we had to try.  Still, you have to hand it to Cho for realizing the trade was a bust and turning it around to get Hawes and Lamb.   If the team flounders this year, however, I think Cho is on his way out."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,TubaMike,7,Wed Jul 1 23:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah /r/nba is a weird place to be a hornets fan. Irrelevant during the season. Dumped on in the offseason.  I think Cho got too much credit for drafting Westbrook and Durant in seattle, and that is part of the track record that got him a job here.  But he is good at making solid under the radar moves as well.  I just wish his clt drafts were better.  Still, he is a huge improvement over mj's former yes man regime."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,asher1611,5,Wed Jul 1 22:43:47 2015 UTC,/r/nba is stupid and didn't really watch any of our games. Cho has made good moves so far and people are just circle jerking for karma. And I wouldn't say he wasted draft picks. Vonleh turned into batum and Cody has been a decent player.
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,deemerritt,5,Wed Jul 1 23:02:01 2015 UTC,"I don't hate what he's done this off season, and this is definitely his make or break year I'd say.  I feel like he was overly cautious in previous years this off season he is actually making some effort.  I was ready to say fuck 'em I'll take my chances with someone else until the trades came through, if you look at my post history I went from someone generally criticizing Cho and what's happening, to a guy who is optimistic and defending the franchise for recent moves, basically over night.  He's won back some level of good faith from me but we've still got a ways to go before I'd call his job secure.  He's doing a lot better IMO now than sitting around with his thumb up his ass waiting for the pieces to fall together."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,net403,4,Wed Jul 1 21:04:36 2015 UTC,"What many people fail to realize about Rich Cho is, he is taking the controlled risks a small market team like Charlotte needs. MKG, Zeller, Vonleh, Kaminsky were not wastes they are all young developing players,  and come Summer league you may be eating your words. Charlotte has to take some risk to ascend in the East. However Charlotte hasn't given up a killer contract like Josh Smiths 4 year 52 million deal in Detroit. If Charlotte fans are mad they haven't been paying attention, a few players that had breakout seasons in Charlotte just outright ran in free agency, Mullens, CDR, McRoberts too name a few. I will admit Charlotte has to perform this year for Cho and Clifford's sake."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,unclefunkjr,2,Wed Jul 1 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand that we see the team as IMPROVING year to year. Last year we took a chance with lance, but MOST fans and pundents thought it was a good move and that it would improve us... it did not, but you cant fault the original plan.   Our roster is even better this year then it was last year."
CharlotteHornets,3bsn1s,I_am_not_angry,2,Thu Jul 2 14:13:53 2015 UTC,"He's been a pretty terrible drafter, even though he has gotten a few unlucky breaks too. However, he is good at negotiating deals and trades. I really like the Batum trade, I just hope we can extend him. Lamb was a smart pickup because he's young and I like our chances that either he or PJ flourishes this season. The jury is out on Hawes, as his skill set seems a bit repetitive after drafting Kaminsky and when taking into account we let our only rim protector (Biz) go.   I'm a positive fan, like most on this sub, but realistically, we are not in the top 50% most talented teams in the east right now. I think our biggest needs are a better backup PG, rim protector and backup SF/wing shooter."

CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,1234Squad,10,Wed Jul 1 16:13:07 2015 UTC,I'm sure he wasn't the only one.   Edit: I'd take this with a grain of salt cause I'm pretty sure Bonnell was one of a few beat writers who hated the Kaminsky pick and shat all over it. Kaminsky is gonna be heavily scrutinized no matter what he does now and it doesn't help when these writers want to point out every time he messes up to justify their dislike of the pick.
CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,aceboogieville,4,Wed Jul 1 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"Sure, but Kaminsky out of everyone shouldn't really be looking rusty.   The two people who shouldn't be rusty are PJ and Frank. Everyone else I'd give a pass to, but these guys are supposed to get serious playing time.  As far ass Bonnell scrutinizing his mistakes, he's not making anything up, and I would much rather have our local beat writers question our teams moves than act like sheep (as has been the case in the past) and pretend we are a piece away from contending."
CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,TheCarolinaPanthers,11,Wed Jul 1 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"Lol at people expecting these athletes to constantly be in their peak form. It's the summer. He just got drafted and has a couple million dollars in his bank account. Wouldn't you want to enjoy your life and maybe, I don't know, relax after 4 years of busting your balls to get into the NBA? Cut the dude some slack.  And we don't even know how Frank and PJ are going to fit into the rotation this year, so expecting them to get ""serious"" playing time is just dumb, especially with Clifford's track record of playing rookies and the other additions to the team, including two guys who play the same position as PJ. But you're right about Bonnell not making anything up, I'm actually a fan of his because of his work covering the Panthers, but I'm also not gonna get up in arms when he reports a trivial detail about a guy showing up to preseason workouts a little rusty."
CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,aceboogieville,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:42:54 2015 UTC,"If my body was my livelihood I would never appear ""rusty""."
CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,TheCarolinaPanthers,2,Thu Jul 2 11:23:12 2015 UTC,"Bonnell calls it how he sees it. He might not be interesting or exciting, but he is rational and consistent. Ewing himself said Frank looked rusty, so Bonnell reported it.   Nothing out of the ordinary.  Tanks get rusty when they're not in use."
CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,TubaMike,8,Wed Jul 1 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"This is Ewing trying to motivate Kaminsky to play hard and learn this summer.  In the grand scheme of things the only player that matters on our summer roster is Frank, and coaches recognize this so they're trying to light a fire under his ass to maximize the time they have him."

CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,TheFanslator,10,Wed Jul 1 16:37:32 2015 UTC,Seriously. He probably hasn't played in a meaningful team practice since... the tournament I'm guessing? Draft workouts can only simulate so much.
CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,turnertornado,6,Wed Jul 1 16:40:10 2015 UTC,"And he's in a whole knew situation with different coaches and players he's never played with before, I think he'll be fine"

CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,Daheixiong,6,Wed Jul 1 18:44:23 2015 UTC,"I've sort of suspected that Boston fans have had a thing against our team ever since last season.  Not really sure why, but it escelated with this draft.  Quite a few of them were certain pre-draft that we, the Hornets, were going to trade down to them to give them WCS or some other pick.  As usual, Boston fans assume they are right, or are owed something, and when we didn't trade down they got unhappy.  Then when people have insinuated that Ainge either bent the truth about the picks, or offered up shitty stockpiled picks, they deny, or go on Charlotte threads and bash.  Again, not sure what else there is, but this seems to have made them salty about our team, and not towards Detroit or Miami who were also offered the same deal."
CharlotteHornets,3brlo6,ReidM15,2,Wed Jul 1 22:15:28 2015 UTC,A lot of Portland fans have been giving us shit too over in /r/NBA.

CharlotteHornets,3bobha,APPaholic47,2,Wed Jul 1 11:48:53 2015 UTC,He's already with the Spurs again.
CharlotteHornets,3bobha,TheCarolinaPanthers,15,Wed Jul 1 16:24:54 2015 UTC,This could be great. Trying to add 3-point depth we  have too frequently gone after borderline 3-point shooters with potential who end up losing their touch once they get here (*cough *cough looking at you Lance and Marvin). A certified sniper like Bellinelli is what we need to show that it's possible to come to Charlotte and still be able to hit 3's.
CharlotteHornets,3bobha,richt519,5,Tue Jun 30 20:56:03 2015 UTC,remember what happened with Gary Neal?

CharlotteHornets,3bobha,BobcatsHornets,5,Tue Jun 30 21:24:13 2015 UTC,Gary WHO?
CharlotteHornets,3bobha,TheCarolinaPanthers,5,Tue Jun 30 22:46:41 2015 UTC,Yup unfortunately even previously certified snipers can apparently have their license revoked after a stay in Charlotte. It's like we're caught in some hellish loop of good shooters we bring in not being able to shoot because we don't have good shooters.
CharlotteHornets,3bobha,richt519,9,Tue Jun 30 21:26:58 2015 UTC,Gary Neal got a concussion early last season and was never the same afterwords. He was fire for us last year and early on this year though.
CharlotteHornets,3bobha,wonkyarm,2,Tue Jun 30 22:18:16 2015 UTC,He really helped the push to the playoffs when he first got here.  I thought he was going to be the answer at backup SG/challenge for a starting role.  I guess it wasn't meant to be.
CharlotteHornets,3bobha,TubaMike,11,Wed Jul 1 01:33:19 2015 UTC,Bellinelli sounds like a perfect target for the mid-level exception

CharlotteHornets,3bobha,ReidM15,2,Tue Jun 30 22:00:06 2015 UTC,That'd be ideal.  We need a solid backup to MKG.
CharlotteHornets,3bobha,TubaMike,7,Wed Jul 1 01:34:45 2015 UTC,GS please! You guy don't need any more shooters. We need a guy with a decent 3 ball.   Seriously though this move plus Batum will just add to the perimeter shooting we're trying to build. Plus being an Italian- American I'd love to see an Italian on the squad.

CharlotteHornets,3bobha,VanGundysBaldHead,6,Tue Jun 30 23:57:08 2015 UTC,Good from both corners and above the break. I don't get why so many Warriors fans disparage him. He's mildly inconsistent but he's a good player and he's 23.
CharlotteHornets,3bobha,ampman_1789,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"Andre can knock down 3s all day, and his short range pull up jumper (while rarely used) isn't terrible either."

CharlotteHornets,3bobha,net403,3,Wed Jul 1 04:05:38 2015 UTC,"Get it done Cho/Jordan.    Think of the perimeter shooting with this move:  Batum  Lamb  Belinelli  Kaminsky  3J  Kemba? - Obviously not his forte  Hawes?  Williams?  Some are obviously better than others, but thats half the roster with guys who are legitimate threats to knock down a three.  This would clear things up for the Kemba/Frank PnR and room for Al to operate.  Now pick up a defensive Center and a half decent back up PG, and I'll be ecstatic for the season.

CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,backfliptaylor,3,Wed Jul 1 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"Our post defense will most likely look like a trainwreck   Isn't Kaminsky a reasonable post defender? And I though Hawes was similar? I had them both pegged as such, their problem lies in not being particularly quick laterally (not good for guarding smaller 4s on the perimeter, of which there are many) and neither of them are long enough to be effective rim protectors/shot blockers. Worst case scenario, we still have Big Al, who is actually a pretty good post defender.  I actually think if we hold on to Cody, we'll be at least as good defensively as last year, as Cody has the quickness to guard perimeter oriented 4s and 5s. Where we'll lack is rim protection, but that's been a problem whenever we haven't had Biz on the floor, so its something we're at least familiar with. And I still hold out some hope that we might be able to move someone (Hawes/Williams/Roberts/PJ/Daniels) and get some sort of rim protector back, not sure who that would be or why anyone would make that trade, but a guy can dream."
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,buzzbuz,3,Wed Jul 1 03:30:54 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen of Kaminsky, he is pretty easy to back down and most NBA bigs with a decent hook can just go over him with that. He fights though so he denies a good amount of post entries but when they do find it in there, he's not very good."
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,BobcatsHornets,2,Wed Jul 1 03:44:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I kinda assumed a guy his size would be relatively good in the post, especially as he's kinda bulky/not very long."
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,buzzbuz,2,Thu Jul 2 05:30:37 2015 UTC,he's not gaunt or anything but he's fairly thin and on the weaker side of nba bigs. I recently rewatched the Kentucky Wisconsin game and Towns was basically practicing hook shots in an open gym. Obviously Towns was the number one pick this year but about half the league's starting PF's have his size. But also the good denials were prevalent in that game as well. Towns was like 3 for 4 in the post against him which is high efficiency but low enough volume to not bother your overall D too much
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:39:02 2015 UTC,"Might have to see if I can get my hands on that game, I don't really watch college ball, so my opinions on these sorts of guys are formed by scouting reports/videos and reddit.  How would you compare his strength and post D to guys similar to his size and game style (Bargnani, Hawes etc)?"
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,buzzbuz,2,Thu Jul 2 23:46:16 2015 UTC,Here's that game if you do end up wanting to watch.  I don't watch much college ball either but I caught a few Kentucky games and watched what I could of Wisconsin since we picked Frank. So I'm no expert either. He's definitely stronger than Bargnani and Hawes though haha I'd say he's about as strong as Cody is in the post. Not the worst but you can't really call it adequate either.
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:24:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting watch, looks like Kaminsky tries to stay upright against guys in the post (to compensate for his lack of length I guess) which makes it easy for people to get underneath him and either back him down or go around.  He does show an uncanny ability to stay infront of smaller guys driving into the paint without fouling. He actually looks like he could function very well in the sort of conservative defensive system Clifford runs, I'm just still not sure who you have him defending. Guess we have to wait and see."
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,buzzbuz,3,Sat Jul 4 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"If Batum is ready to go (which he should be, last year he had a kind of a fluky wrist issue) the wing defense should be extremely good. In addition to being flat out good, our wing rotation is long and tall.  Post defense...um. Well, we'll have some issues protecting the rim. Hawes is a guy whose stats (blocks mostly) vastly oversell his defensive value; no one is scared of the guy at all. Losing Bismack isn't exactly good on that front either. Mobility's probably a wash though. If nothing else, losing Maxiell removes some of the temptation to play subpar veterans over guys with actual potential."
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,Aurion7,3,Wed Jul 1 23:29:16 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, losing Maxiell removes some of the temptation to play subpar veterans over guys with actual potential.   You say this now, but wait until Hawes and Williams get time at the 4 over Kaminsky."
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,buzzbuz,2,Thu Jul 2 05:28:16 2015 UTC,Clifford  has made it seem like Williams will be our back-up 3 now.  With PJ possibly getting time if he improves
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,Daheixiong,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"I don't pretend to know what the rotations are going to be, but what worries me at the moment is that Cody is really the only guy we have with the lateral quickness to stay in front of all the small ball/stretch 4s around the league. Any lineup where Kaminsky/Hawes/Jefferson are on the floor together is going to be so easily exploitable on defense, the opposition just has to go small and watch as Hawes or Kaminsky try to guard guys on the perimeter. This leads me to believe that against certain lineups on certain teams Williams will be the default choice at the 4.  I really hope Hawes doesn't see minutes over Frank (at least until we know what we have in both of them) but I fully expect Marv will spend just as many minutes at the 4 as Frank does.  As the roster stands at the moment I'm hoping that Cliff goes with some sort of 3 man rotation at SG and SF, have Batum and MKG start and then let them share SF backup minutes with the bench unit while we have Daniels/PJ/Lamb at the 2."
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,buzzbuz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"Well, with SH, CZ, and FK all being 4's and a semi stretch 4, I HIGHLY doubt that Williams will get significant 4 time.  His role last year was only due to the FO not trusting Vonleh to take over.  Vonleh is gone and our line-up significantly different meaning that Williams role will probably change."
CharlotteHornets,3bpl1d,Daheixiong,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:53:25 2015 UTC,"Well, with SH, CZ, and FK all being 4's and a semi stretch 4, I HIGHLY doubt that Williams will get significant 4 time.    On offense sure, but on the defensive side of the ball, which of those guys (apart from Cody) do you want guarding a small ball 4? If you don't want Williams seeing time at the 4 (or other small lineups - MKG at the 4?), you're essentially advocating for having Hawes and Frank on the floor at the same time, any team that can go small against that lineup will and just tear our defense apart."

CharlotteHornets,3bo66r,djz84,2,Wed Jul 1 13:22:11 2015 UTC,Of the guys on the summer league roster that we're bringing in I would expect only Alan Williams as the last big man and Aaron Harrison as 3rd pg to have a shot at making the team.

I used a very scientific method (Taking Spencer Hawes rookie year and Dirk's rookie year and averaging them) to predict his '15 stat line>   i laughed way too hard at this  also, I think that Kaminsky will start over Zeller before long. I expect him to be better offensively almost immediately and his spacing will help a whole lot"
CharlotteHornets,3bl6za,BobcatsHornets,4,Tue Jun 30 03:17:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have been thinking that too, if we can have Frank or Hawes on the court the same time as Al then the inside wont be clogged and there would be a lot of 1vs1 that Big Al could crush or they double and someone outside is open"
CharlotteHornets,3bl6za,bubowskee,2,Tue Jun 30 08:20:41 2015 UTC,"Our paint defense would also be god awful. Not everyone has to score every play but everyone has to defend and with any combo of Frank, Hawes, and Big Al in you can damn sure they'll be attacking the paint. So long as Cody improves offensively some he should be serviceable enough on that end of the floor to justify keeping him in the starting lineup.   Edit: Might not be bad to use some of those lineups for short periods if we need points but otherwise I'd stay away from it."
CharlotteHornets,3bl6za,richt519,2,Tue Jun 30 21:08:07 2015 UTC,Zeller isn't exactly a prize on defense either. It seemed like he looked so many players right past him last season.
CharlotteHornets,3bl6za,Johnny_Mo88,4,Wed Jul 1 23:42:28 2015 UTC,"If Frank's offense transfers to the NBA at even a fraction of his college output and he can play serviceable defense, then he will start before the All star break. **  If his offense doesn't transfer or his defense is bad, then he will not start and probably will see limited playing time in favor of Marvin.   ** Completely dependent on Clifford playing a rookie"
CharlotteHornets,3bl6za,mrfixit420,2,Tue Jun 30 16:46:08 2015 UTC,Clifford did say he would experiment with small ball MKG and Kaminsky front courts though which is an indirect way of saying Frank will be playing
CharlotteHornets,3bl6za,BobcatsHornets,3,Tue Jun 30 20:58:45 2015 UTC,"During that Rick Bonnell interview, Bonnell reluctantly said that for now Cody is penciled in to the starting position.  He also was very hesitant to say if Cody was a good player/ good enough."

CharlotteHornets,3bl6za,archer4364,4,Tue Jun 30 11:55:53 2015 UTC,Probably won't. Looks like he wants to go back to Cleveland.

I mean I love the Hornets, but when faced with the championship contender Cavs, and the fighting to try and possibly make the playoffs Hornets the career choice is simple. It'll all really come down to how selfless he want to be."

CharlotteHornets,3biowy,net403,6,Mon Jun 29 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"An issue with that is that would have got us a bench full of 19 year old project players, we're definitely not short on projects lol  We traded away the 2nd round pick because of roster space issues, so getting 6 more picks won't help that.  Would've ended up trading around just to get back to where we started.  Some of the picks were probably 4 or 5 years in the future and protected, who knows the details. Right only SOME people are inferring Kaminsky is a bust, but not all.  He may fit into their plan for the future best, is what I'm hoping for at least."
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,Johnny_Mo88,2,Mon Jun 29 18:28:33 2015 UTC,Exactly! What in the good fuck would we have done with six picks. That's way to many projects for a team that already has too many.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,treehau5_,0,Tue Jun 30 02:26:47 2015 UTC,"just that he had a relatively low ceiling     How do we know what his ceiling is though? None of us here are NBA talent evaluators, and apparently a handful of actual NBA talent evaluators saw enough potential to warrant a draft pick."
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,wotissarcasm,3,Tue Jun 30 15:52:13 2015 UTC,I think they mean Justise Winslow. He was an outstanding one-and-done player who helped the duke blue devils win the national championship.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,net403,3,Mon Jun 29 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you, please see here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h27AcB70Mvc  edit: Upvoted for username"
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,uncreddevil,5,Mon Jun 29 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"I'd actually like to take this a step further. High scoring big men will continue to be prevalent in the NBA after this year. With the way things are shaping up I could see us making a run at Andre Drummond, Valanciunas, Roy Hibbert, or even Timofey Mozgov and a powerful shooter in the form of Evan Fournier, Eric Gordon, Courtney Lee, or Dion Waiters (yes I listed all of those in order of wants to not wants)  This is all hypothetical as of right now but this would transform us in to a potent team that should be top 5 in the east. We need to buff up our PG slot/ Kemba to shoot more wisely and but its all doable. We won't land a superstar but we will have a good run and gun team that teams would fear in the open court and post.  I am hoping for the best and for Cho to actually take control of this team and leave Jordan out of the actual basketball side of business and focus on the marketing side of business. It's what we need. And it's my daily prayer that we actually do well this season."
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,LordHighSummoner,6,Mon Jun 29 17:51:57 2015 UTC,Al for Roy straight up?
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,uncreddevil,3,Mon Jun 29 18:19:37 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be opposed to that for this season. Both are expiring contracts that would alleviate some issues on each team.  I was originally referring to the FA class next year but didn't realize that Hibbert had just opted in to the final year of his contract.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,LordHighSummoner,5,Mon Jun 29 18:34:24 2015 UTC,If only we could convince the Pacers to agree with it
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,pedward,4,Mon Jun 29 18:37:28 2015 UTC,This is amazing. Truly has calmed me down a little bit.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,Sir_Gunner,5,Mon Jun 29 18:40:21 2015 UTC,Likewise. I think I'm ready to embrace the Frank the Tank goofiness now. Somebody make a t-shirt.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,cbtaylor23,4,Mon Jun 29 18:47:28 2015 UTC,He's honestly the most undervalued player of this draft.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,ReidM15,4,Mon Jun 29 22:17:26 2015 UTC,Very interesting take on things.  I am fine with the pick and agree that Winslow is redundant for the current roseter.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,corallok,5,Mon Jun 29 15:57:27 2015 UTC,Really good article. Interesting take on how we're trying to build our team like Orlando w/ Dwight.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,American_,3,Mon Jun 29 16:16:45 2015 UTC,I'm in the camp that was upset at the pick. I'm still not sure what to think but this is a very well written article that made me see many different aspects I never considered. Thanks for posting.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,asher1611,2,Mon Jun 29 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"Good write up on the pick. I feel a clear concise presentation is what a lot of people needed because it seemed like Winslow was a favorite here.   I definitely agree that Kaminsky is a better version of Cody Zeller. Zeller looked like he just didn't want to shoot in some games last year, I recall going to a game against the Wizards and he didn't even score.  We can't win games putting up less than 90 points a game every night. Scoring was a need and we've addressed that big time already, although I would've like to see Hendo stay :/"
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:42:47 2015 UTC,I didn't really follow college basketball last year so I wasn't sure where the Winslow/MKG comparisons were coming from given Winslow's apparent penchant for hitting the 3.  This breakdown helped me understand a bit more.
CharlotteHornets,3biowy,Elcor05,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:36:59 2015 UTC,The biggest thing i took from this is that Clifford stated clearly that Kaminsky will be playing in NBA games next season. That's a win for us!

CharlotteHornets,3bjvmt,Willarent17,7,Mon Jun 29 20:37:17 2015 UTC,Pretty sure its 4
CharlotteHornets,3bjvmt,rutherford2212,3,Mon Jun 29 21:03:31 2015 UTC,It's currently #4
CharlotteHornets,3bjvmt,Sir_Gunner,2,Mon Jun 29 22:15:56 2015 UTC,He's listed at #4 right now but all reports indicate that we're not bring back JT so my guess is when we let Taylor go Frank will go back to #44 like in college
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,Titanstheory,14,Tue Jun 30 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"And yet we were all ecstatic about this past season and we see how that turned out...  I'm optimistic about this season, if for no other reason than to see how our new team looks. At this point, with contention being unrealistic, I'm just excited to see our youth develop further. If Frank gets decent, regular minutes, it'll be a major improvement over Vonleh's last season. Whether he starts to show potential or not, at least we won't be wondering what could have been."
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,nuck_futs,5,Tue Jun 30 05:09:55 2015 UTC,"I am also optimistic.  Although most of us here on the sub thinks that the team is building the in the wrong direction, the FO seems to be a making a better team for Big Alfense.  We added shooting, kept draft picks and kept some expiring contracts. If this season fails, we will be out from under Al's contract and Batum's.  With the large amount of cap space we have plus the new TV deal, we should have room to make a splash in FA."
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,mrfixit420,3,Tue Jun 30 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Steve Clifford's job could be in jeopardy if we don't make it to the playoffs again next season. Not that I blame the guy. It seems like he's just following orders from the front office to win now. Either way, next offseason should be fun if we can somehow attract a good free agent or two."
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,nuck_futs,3,Tue Jun 30 17:47:06 2015 UTC,That would be the worst decision we've made in a long time. He's managed to turn us into a damn good defensive team and that's something. You can win games like that.
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,richt519,4,Tue Jun 30 21:15:29 2015 UTC,I dunno about you. But what I am most excited about is seeing how much futher MKG will have progressed this offseason. That guy is a Gym Rat.
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,TheCarolinaPanthers,2,Tue Jun 30 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"I really hope he makes as much progress on his jumpshot as he did last offseason, even without Mark Price."
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,nuck_futs,9,Wed Jul 1 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"I'm an eternal optimist when it comes to the sports teams I follow.    I think the team will have better chemistry than last year. I think we're due for a year without a big injury hit. I think Al will be in better shape and motivated in the final year of his contract. I think Batum will be an upgrade over Hendo. Lamb, Hawes, and Kaminsky will help the bench. PJ will grow up a little and see more minutes.   I think we'll make the playoffs.  MKG will be an all-defense 2nd or 3rd team player and will be regarded as an ""all-star snub.""  Then again, I'm an optimist."
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,TubaMike,4,Tue Jun 30 04:49:02 2015 UTC,I'm on board. There's no way we are a bottom five offense this year which should be fun and our D should remain fairly good as we only lost Biz as far as defensive players go. I'd be shocked if we didn't finish at least 6th in the east (though injuries are always possible)
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,BobcatsHornets,2,Tue Jun 30 05:11:31 2015 UTC,I'm not going to have playoff expectations for this team until I see how they fit. We were expected to be a top 5 team in the east last year after the Lance signing and that didn't work out at all.
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,nuck_futs,7,Wed Jul 1 00:41:57 2015 UTC,That article on Frank and the 2012 draft puts all these moves in the perspective that management is building around MKG. That's bold and has me thinking they've seen him make even more significant improvement this offseason. I can't complain about that
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,BobcatsHornets,5,Tue Jun 30 04:51:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this helps you, but I'm as optimistic about the team now as I was this time last year.  We've added X factors, and we've lost very little.  To me, the potential to progress is much better than the potential to regress this coming season.  And next season still has possibilities to steady the course or improve further.  At this point I think winning now is more valuable than floundering for 2 or 3, more talking about ""potential"" and prospect building, the wins will bring more options to build."
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,net403,3,Tue Jun 30 15:32:21 2015 UTC,REMEMBER THE BOBCATS  WE ALREADY HIT ROCK BOTTOM. NOW WE ARE CRAWLING BACK TO THE TOP!
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,paulzors,5,Tue Jun 30 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"I start getting twitchy whenever I see the FO of a team I follow making save-my-job-by-winning-now moves, and that's pretty much my read on the Hornets' offseason.   All too often those moves don't work out as hoped, everyone gets fired, and they leave a big ol' mess for whoever gets hired next. Hope that isn't what happens here."
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,Aurion7,3,Tue Jun 30 05:38:34 2015 UTC,"To what alternative though, repeating last year's plan seems like the other choice, which at best would make the team sort of ""OK"" in the East.  If Batum works out we could resign him, if Lamb doesn't it won't pin us down, there are options.  I kind of like seeing them make an effort.  You could be right it could blow up in everyone's face, but it also could work.  If this team makes an 8th seed, I'd say that made the offseason a success... if they are above .500 then definitely a success, in the East that's probably at least the 7th seed.  Still have plenty of room to work on the following year with a few trades and draft imo"
CharlotteHornets,3ble43,net403,4,Tue Jun 30 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I think the mistake we made last year was not doing enough. It was as if the FO thought ""we made the playoffs, so we really just need to add a big name free agent and replace some of our smaller role players"". If we have another bad season, it's not for a lack of trying."

CharlotteHornets,3bi7tu,Daheixiong,18,Mon Jun 29 12:57:23 2015 UTC,"Everyone loves to hate on MJ as an executive.  He was the GOAT as a player, so people feel like it is poetic justice (or, uh, Justise) that he fails as an owner/GM.    I actually think that MJ is pretty good for the business side of things.  He's a way better owner than Robert Johnson.  Unfortunately, whenever he does anything wrong, people will go straight to Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.    MJ had a real shot for redemption as an exec.  He made the difficult decision to tank the team after the Bobcats made the playoffs for the first time in NBA history.  All the ridicule he received after the team went on to the worst win% in NBA history would have been worth it if we were rightfully awarded the #1 pick.  Instead, we got #2 and New Orleans stole something else from Charlotte.  If we were able to draft Anthony Davis, we would be the ""team on the rise"" with a serious shot at the championship in the next few years.  Everyone would be praising MJ for steering this team back on track.    I'm still salty."
CharlotteHornets,3bi7tu,TubaMike,3,Mon Jun 29 15:43:31 2015 UTC,I actually think we would have done a better job of surrounding Davis with good people than NO has too. I'm not sure if that makes me feel better or not.
CharlotteHornets,3bi7tu,Elcor05,3,Mon Jun 29 19:13:50 2015 UTC,The day we lost AD will forever haunt hornets fans.
CharlotteHornets,3bi7tu,richt519,3,Mon Jun 29 19:56:37 2015 UTC,"The Problem is Jordan has made the worst decisions as an executive/owner in his time being one. His track record his horrendous.  He does not get flack because he is MJ the GOAT, he gets flack because he makes head-scratching borderline bonehead moves.   There have been plenty of All-Time greats that haven't gotten the same flack because they have been successful.   Orlando doesn't get the scrutiny because they are much better than us, and at least better run. Would you trade our whole team and assets for theirs? I would. Same can be said for Philly.   See when you look at Philly, you can see what they're doing. You can see the reasons the end-game. And here you have to guess more at what our end-game is.   We can pretend that it's some sort of genius plot, and that the higher-ups no more than us, or the rest of the league for that matter, and that everything will be great in the future.   We can also pretend that we are NBA guru's and that we know better than Michael and co. And that we know where this rabbit hole is going.  The truth of the matter is that the criticism MJ is getting (when it isn't trolling or circlejerking) is 100% warranted. But not because MJ is clue-less or anything like that, but because MJ isn't really familiar with his role. He's a relatively young guy in his early 50s, and he's still trying to figure out a way to make this team good. He's made a ton of mistakes on his way to today, but his growth as an owner and a decision maker has been substantial.   So the reason MJ is getting these negative remarks is because he is making these Bad moves, which can be perceived as growing pains. Where as a team like Philly, is making great moves. It's widely considered that Heinke knows what he's doing because he currently has three (technically four) potential superstars on his roster. We have one in MKG. Orlando has two.   So when you look at it, we are getting the scrutiny we deserve (when you exclude circle-jerk responses which every team gets)."
CharlotteHornets,3bi7tu,TheCarolinaPanthers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:43:43 2015 UTC,"More positive, it'd depend on the day. /r/nba is pretty fickle from day to day.  Less negative, almost certainly. Michael's Wizards tenure tainted his rep as an executive to the point where anything that goes wrong here is very easy to pin on him. A certain amount of negativity is probably inevitable just because of the fickleness. There were some pretty outrageous things getting said about the Sixers on the regular, mention the Spurs and get deluged in sarcastic ""classy"" comments if it's a Tuesday or a crescent moon or Tony Parker slept with someone's mama, etc."
CharlotteHornets,3bi7tu,Aurion7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:55:22 2015 UTC,If the Hornets were winning more people wouldn't use MJ nearly as much of a punching bag.  But we're not winning.  And we have a lot of rough Bobcats history.  For many of the people on /r/nba they have no idea or memories of the expansion Hornets and those years leading up to the move to NOLA.  All they know is Charlotte = failure.
CharlotteHornets,3bi7tu,asher1611,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:51:11 2015 UTC,Before the draft I think r/nba was actually more forgiving because of MJ.

I think Hornets fans are the ones who are extra negative thanks to Jordan. Expectations went up.

CharlotteHornets,3bhb05,cbtaylor23,3,Mon Jun 29 14:51:26 2015 UTC,I hope so too. Batum was a great acquisition in my opinion. He's definitely a skilled player and I have my fingers crossed he finds his step again here. Glad to know he'll be getting the nod as a starter. He'll definitely had some pace and range to the floor. Plus he has the ability to go inside as well.
CharlotteHornets,3bhb05,Macaway,3,Mon Jun 29 15:29:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like Batum to Charlotte will end up being one of the best under the radar moves next season. He's automatically an upgrade over Hendo and Lance, since he's been a legit starter on a playoff team, even Lance can't say that because he was more a 6th man for the Pacers and will probably be the same for LA. The length we'll suddenly have on the wings will be fun to see, Batum should most definitely improve MKG's game for sure.  If he sticks around for more than one season than praise be to Cho."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,TenaciousHornet,12,Sun Jun 28 16:27:23 2015 UTC,"I'm super excited for Batum. We haven't had a SG as versatile as him. With the ability to shoot the three, pass and rebound, I believe he and Kemba will go great together."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,ReidM15,5,Sun Jun 28 16:46:29 2015 UTC,We are going to have the best rebounding wings in the NBA.
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,paulzors,0,Sun Jun 28 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"he reaaly can shoo the three though, hes declined very heavily as shooter, i dont want to be a debbie downer but i really dont think putting at the 2 is a good idea especcialy with mkg at the 3"
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,irwinator,6,Sun Jun 28 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"The only decline was last year, when the whole team pretty much declined. Batum was suffering from a wrist injury, which hurt his shooting. With recovery from that, and having his divorce out of the way, he should be fine."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,ReidM15,4,Sun Jun 28 18:07:02 2015 UTC,He's declined in three point shooting three years in a row but he hasn't become a bad shooter. Just not the good one he used to be. I expect it to pick up this year with the looks he'll be getting
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,BobcatsHornets,2,Sun Jun 28 22:17:15 2015 UTC,You think he's going to get better looks playing with our roster instead of Damian Lillard and Lamarcus Aldridge?
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,In_Liberty,19,Mon Jun 29 01:42:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of people are sleeping on this pickup. This is a guy who could average 20, 5, 5 if he gets enough minutes/looks on offense. I'm looking forward to see how he does as a #1 and #2 scoring option with the offense flowing through him. Lot's of reasons to be excited about the possibilities."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,aceboogieville,9,Sun Jun 28 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"This is a guy who could average 20, 5, 5 if he gets enough minutes/looks on offense.    I'm having flashbacks to what people said about Lance"
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,turnertornado,6,Sun Jun 28 20:44:38 2015 UTC,"One thing that Lance is that Batum isn't: cancerous. Lance could still totally be that type of player, he's just gonna piss off everyone around him in the process. Batum is a much more team friendly guy."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,aceboogieville,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:10:53 2015 UTC,"There styles are completely different too, Batum is closer to your traditional 3 and D guy, I'm so excited to see him next to MKG. I think his experience playing next to Alderidge and Lillard will definitely make a difference too. Lance is the better passer, but he never had the experience playing next to a low post god like Jefferson, Batum has.   Next just season screams for Batum having a crazy border line all star contract year and then signing to some one like the Bulls the year after because Charlotte can't have nice things."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,Macaway,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:39:56 2015 UTC,Batum isn't a ball stopper like Lance.
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,Ihateloops,4,Mon Jun 29 08:26:08 2015 UTC,"Just so we're all clear, we gave up a Noah and Hendo for a year of Batum. Turned down 6 future draft picks for Frank Kaminsky. This franchise is the definition of shortsighted."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,Sdt6023,8,Sun Jun 28 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"They're not shortsighted, Batum is 26, Kemba 25, MKG 21, Zeller 22, Kaminsky 22, PJ 22, Daniels 23, Hawes 27, Biz 22. We have a very young roster that has the chance to grow together and become a very solid team. Adding Batum just adds some leadership and more offense. Almost none of our players are even in their prime yet."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,ReidM15,8,Sun Jun 28 19:37:55 2015 UTC,I was pretty upset about getting batum until i realiuzed hes 26. Feels like he's been around forever.
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,BobcatsHornets,3,Sun Jun 28 22:19:24 2015 UTC,"He literally has been a contributor for trailblazers since the moment they drafted him, he may be a one year rental, but I'm hyped to see him play with our line up."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,Macaway,10,Mon Jun 29 06:18:27 2015 UTC,"You don't know the Batum won't resign. I don't understand why people think he's just automatically gone. We're giving him a shot to be one of our cornerstone stars, I doubt many people walk away from the opportunity."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,pedward,9,Sun Jun 28 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"This is how I'm feeling. We gave him a one year to stay safe. Not because we're short sighted. If he comes in and balls then he gets another contract offer. He comes in and pulls a Lance we ship him out. No fuss, no muss. This was clean simple business sense."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,Johnny_Mo88,2,Sun Jun 28 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"We didn't give him one year, he had one year left on exisiting deal."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,cbtaylor23,2,Mon Jun 29 15:00:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for correcting me Buzzbro.
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,Johnny_Mo88,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:11:40 2015 UTC,"I think the concern is that if Batum comes in and balls out (or even just plays at the level he's shown capable of playing at), then he's going to command more money next season than we have to throw at him.  The only way we throw that sort of money at him is if the FO starts to think he's a future superstar and want him to be the face of the franchise."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,buzzbuz,0,Mon Jun 29 04:33:03 2015 UTC,I don't think they'd be willing to throw to much at him. I mean if we lose him we lose him. I don't think resigning him will be based on us making him the face of the franchise. I think he understands his postion well.
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,Johnny_Mo88,7,Mon Jun 29 05:19:04 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why everyone gives Vonleh all the credit for being a star and hardly playing a single meaningful minute in his entire NBA career, they instantly assume just gave away a super star and don't develop players, completely glazing over all the mid-development players we still have that actually get minutes.  Maybe he's good in 3 years, who in Charlotte wants to wait 3 more years for yet another project guy when we can get a functional immediate return, for basically giving away nothing but an average SG and last years draft pick who didn't player.  This is a risk reward trade that needed to be made so they could hold onto at least some of the fanbase they reclaimed this season.  People just want to create a shitstorm over a guy no one really knows anything about on the pro level, just projections.  Batum could easily resign, and we aren't spending much more than we were on Lance, which was considered a decent deal, the salary cap goes up soon giving us more flexibility.  I'm willing to take a chance on something rather than staying put and spinning our wheels, even with a healthy roster this season it's not like we were on the verge of blowing up, we haven't even lost anything with established value this off season either.  I like Vonleh but people talk like he was about to be our best player, or already was for that matter.  Sorry that is frustration with some of this spilling over haha"
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,net403,4,Sun Jun 28 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"That ""6 future picks"" thing is pretty much only coming from Ainge. I don't buy it."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,Ihateloops,7,Mon Jun 29 08:28:01 2015 UTC,"ALLEGEDLY, at least 4 other teams turned down the picks as well.  Consider people give Noah a lot of credit for things he has never even done.  He has never even played but people talk like he's already the chosen one, Hendo isn't great, we got a serviceable ""right now"" return on a future unknown, of which we still have plenty that are mid-development. Batum may not work out as well as Hendo but you know no one can say that right now.  Don't short-sight the trade itself without looking at it from all angles"
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,net403,5,Sun Jun 28 19:37:02 2015 UTC,Exactamundo! Vonleh is just one of those players that people have this unfounded love for. Seriously what has he done to merit this uproar. We have enough projects or could be's. It's about time we made a right now move.
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,Johnny_Mo88,6,Sun Jun 28 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, they flame the team for trading Vonleh, but then on the other hand, Frank, who similar to Vonleh is unknown and hasn't played a real minute, is already a total failure and wasted pick who they also flame the team for.  Of course feeling strongly both ways at the same time.  All the while decrying the team for not winning enough right now.    The team probably put themselves in the position to need Frank, after trading for Batum, expecting, unpredictably that a top 5 would not have fallen to 9.  This should be the most upvoted point of view on the whole sub this week lol What I've seen since Thursday from the masses is so nonchalantly contradictory ."
CharlotteHornets,3bewef,net403,3,Sun Jun 28 21:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yep! I keep commenting there may be a valid reason the Winslow fell. There is a lot of unfounded love for him, and vice versa for the Kaminsky hate. I feel this is a Winslow played for Duke so we need him type thing. Kaminsky has more than enough credentials to validate a chance. Vonleh hasn't proven his worth. People are acting like we traded Kemba off. I'd do the same trade 10/10. If I could save Hendo I'd try, but only because I like him. I say that only to further my point about Vonleh. Just because you like Vonleh, Winslow, or whoever else doesn't mean they're the Hornets best fit. This is a business at the end of the day. They're trying to win games not keep a friendship circle going. That the type of thing that has screws the Panthers over in the past, and is doing it to the Canes(hockey) right now. Some times head gotta roll. It's about winning not patting backs."

CharlotteHornets,3benqf,Andrewbooboo,13,Sun Jun 28 15:03:20 2015 UTC,"I think being with Kemba will help. I'm not expecting a lot, but for Matt Barnes contract I'll take it. He'll probably get 10-20 minutes a game. He should be a solid rotation player."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,Unibrow69,3,Sun Jun 28 15:11:58 2015 UTC,Who is y'all's first option at SG?
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,ReidM15,11,Sun Jun 28 15:18:35 2015 UTC,"Nic Batum is starting SG. Then it will go Lamb, PJ Hairston, Troy Daniels. I'd imagine Lamb is starting over PJ just from more experience. I wouldn't be surprised to see Daniels or PJ traded sometime this offseason."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,jaynay1,4,Sun Jun 28 15:24:42 2015 UTC,"I think Daniels is probably ahead of PJ at this point, which is sad.  I think PJ actually sees more minutes at the 3 than the 2 also."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,ReidM15,2,Sun Jun 28 18:58:40 2015 UTC,"I know. I really want PJ to succeed, but I feel like he doesn't care enough."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,jaynay1,5,Sun Jun 28 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"To be totally honest, I feel like given a tiny amount of room he'd be fine.  Clifford should have suspended him for the 1 game for missing weights, but pushing him to the end of the bench is bullcrap."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,Unibrow69,-4,Sun Jun 28 19:26:46 2015 UTC,I think PJ Hairston will be the starter this season. But I think Jeremy Lamb will be the 2nd unit guy ahead of Troy Daniels.
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,ReidM15,15,Sun Jun 28 15:23:29 2015 UTC,Batum is starting SG.
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,imeanYOLOright,2,Sun Jun 28 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"I mean, I see how it could work. But I don't think I've ever seen him play a SG in Portland."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,ReidM15,8,Sun Jun 28 15:36:01 2015 UTC,"He and MKG will probably have pretty interchangeable positions.  Batum will probably be more a traditional ""SG"" on offense and ""SF"" on defense."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,Binatko,2,Sun Jun 28 16:00:58 2015 UTC,"He played SG some last season I believe. He and MKG will switch off for defense. MKG will guard the 2, Batum the 3(in most situations). He will be starting SG though, I believe Cho has said it in a couple of conferences."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,schrutebeetfarms,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:17:58 2015 UTC,He's a little slow for the 2 I think.
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,the_Hero_Complex,11,Sun Jun 28 15:38:55 2015 UTC,"I have basically no expectations.  I've found this is the best way to go as a Hornets fan.  If we get something out of him, awesome!  If we don't, well, I've seen that story before."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,Aurion7,2,Sun Jun 28 18:14:42 2015 UTC,average of 5-6 pts with <4 total assists+rebounds a game
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,buzzbuz,2,Sun Jun 28 20:36:55 2015 UTC,"I have no idea.   He had a few flashes of serious potential in OKC, but overall he was pretty mediocre. Getting out from under the shadow left behind with his association to the Harden trade might help him out as far as mentality goes.  It'll be interesting to see which of Lamb/Daniels/PJ emerges as the top option off the bench on the wing. Guessing Lamb and then Daniels because everything I've seen seems to suggest the organization believes Troy can be a legit contributor, and he has a pretty nice 3 stroke when he gets to use it."
CharlotteHornets,3benqf,HIV_Salad,2,Mon Jun 29 02:35:45 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen much of his game tbh, so not really sure what to expect. But, unless we get some crazy improvements out of PJ Hairston or Troy Daniels, I would expect he'll be seeing 20ish minutes a game. It will depend on who we bring in as a backup PG and how Clifford utilizes Marvin Williams (at the 3, or as a stretch 4).  Out of the 3 guys we received back in trades, Lamb is the guy I'm most excited about."
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,NotSoberDontCare,8,Mon Jun 29 04:37:32 2015 UTC,Steph Curry will never wear a Hornets jersey. He'll stay with Golden State for years to come.
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,Johnny_Mo88,2,Mon Jun 29 05:23:10 2015 UTC,"Prime Steph Curry. When he's in his mid-thirties, a year or two away from retirement, I absolutely believe he'd consider ending his career here. But his legacy will be in Golden State."
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,joshhay,2,Mon Jun 29 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"I doubt it man. People around here believe this way too hard. Just because he's dad played here doesn't mean he will. I'm not hating on the man by any means(I'm a fan), but it's just unrealistic. If he ever leaves GS it'll be to another contender or large market team."
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,Johnny_Mo88,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:24 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think the way he talks about his dad and the Carolina certainly makes it feasible for a 35 year old Steph to sign and retire here, especially now that Dell has an expanded role with the organization"

CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,Johnny_Mo88,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"Hah, no, but players think a lot about legacy. That's why LeBron went back to Cleveland, and why Kevin Garnett was so happy about going back to Minnesota (granted, he was also getting off the god-awful Nets team). This is a player with a very strong connection, both to the team and the state. Why is it so hard to believe he would want to play here when he's outside of his prime?"
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,joshhay,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:06:59 2015 UTC,I'm just a pessimist I suppose.
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,Johnny_Mo88,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:40:02 2015 UTC,"It's one of those things that I would really like to see happen, and is possible, but nothing incredible. The people that think he's coming here when his contract in GS is up are fooling themselves. He's got too much going right for him there."
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,joshhay,6,Tue Jun 30 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"The Hornets are taking a page out of the Pistons book in 2003-05. Collecting a lot of borderline all-star players, and trying to make a run in the playoffs. Lance Stephenson was our first attempt, Nik Batum is our next, we also attempted to sign Gordon Hayward. I think the Hornets have wanted to draft all of their bigs, because they are expensive as shit in free agency. So what are you left with? Actually, a pretty deep team that could compete for a 50 win season."
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,unclefunkjr,2,Mon Jun 29 05:31:59 2015 UTC,"I just don't see the borderline all-stars on the roster.   Al played at an All-Star level 2 years ago, but it's tough to see him returning to form the way he's been slowing down. Kemba appears to have topped out as just an average point guard. He'll never make an all-star game unless Wall, Irving and Rose are injured. Zeller? Nope. MKG is an incredible defender but he'll never get all-star consideration unless his offensive game improves markedly. Batum might have a chance in a conference that is weak on shooting guards, but only if the team is winning. Kaminsky? Way too premature to project him as a future fringe all-star.   No way this team competes for 50 wins next year. I'm hopeful that Batum and Kaminsky will help with spacing, but the roster is weak compared to Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami and Indiana's. Best we can hope for is that Cho finds a way to move Big Al for another shooter and we move to an offensive system that suits the rest of our roster. Because let's face it, our offense is completely broken right now."
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,kr0kodil,2,Mon Jun 29 17:35:23 2015 UTC,"I think you are making my point. If you think Walker is 3 players behind being an all-star, that is by definition borderline. Big Al only strugged last year because of spacing, 29th in the league in 3pt%, and with the added spacing were giving him he could be another borderline all-star talent. We added Nik Batum, who could be the new style of 2 guard Charlotte needs, 3 and D, another borderline player. Don't sleep on Zeller, he has the IQ, size, youth, work ethic,and namely athleticism to have a breakout season. I would honestly bet on MKG to improve from last season.  So all of a sudden you have atleast 5 borderline all-stars who are all young except Al. I like our odds at competing for the 5th seed, behind the Cavs, Atlanta, Chicago, and Washington in that order. If the Heat retain all of their players, then things could get a bit more dicey."
CharlotteHornets,3bh5zh,unclefunkjr,5,Mon Jun 29 19:19:48 2015 UTC,well then we really are screwed more than we thought

CharlotteHornets,3bh6qi,Dhalphir,7,Mon Jun 29 07:18:08 2015 UTC,"Why the hell would Phoenix ever take that deal. Why in the hell would we do it, when we're paying Kemba 12m a year."
CharlotteHornets,3bh6qi,Aurion7,5,Mon Jun 29 05:55:34 2015 UTC,"I dunno.   I was thinking about Al today and after his contract is up, he's not going to make near as much as he is now, so if he can still score, he might be a good guy to keep if we can keep him for the right price."
CharlotteHornets,3bh6qi,TheCarolinaPanthers,3,Mon Jun 29 04:51:44 2015 UTC,"Right? I know Al's an easy target and ain't getting any younger, but I really wouldn't be surprised if Al sticks around for a discount after this season (If the Hornets make the playoffs anyway.) And you know what, I wouldn't mind him staying if he takes less since the cap will grow soon anyway.  From all accounts it sounds like Al wants stay for the long haul, he's been pretty much a journey man before he came here and enjoys playing for a ""Southern"" team."
CharlotteHornets,3bh6qi,Macaway,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:31:03 2015 UTC,I love Al but hate the stagnant offense he requires. Such a conundrum for me.
CharlotteHornets,3bh6qi,SelflessDion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:28:22 2015 UTC,"The offense stalled around Al last season because Charlotte had almost zero presence behind the line, even in his first as a Bobcat, he had Kemba and McBob there to at least keep defenses honest even if neither was known for being great outside shooters. That's going to change with the additions of Batum, Lamb and Hawes (I wonder how many minutes Spence and Al will share on court.) Also people are really ignore how banged up he was too, foot injuries are no joke and take a minute to fully recover from."
CharlotteHornets,3bh6qi,Macaway,4,Wed Jul 1 09:26:21 2015 UTC,"I doubt Phoenix goes for that. Jefferson would be basically worthless to them in their young rebuilding fast paced team. The picks would have to have very low protection on them for Phoenix to bite, in which case I wouldn't want to do that. After watching the disappointment of this season, this team could suck at any point in time."
CharlotteHornets,3bh6qi,BobcatsHornets,4,Mon Jun 29 05:14:37 2015 UTC,"The Hornets aren't gonna do this. Eric Bledsoe is a borderline all-star player, and doesn't represent that much of an upgrade over Kemba. If anything they would split time. The Hornets cannot afford to two first round picks, our franchise center who just resigned, to add a redundant piece. The Hornets probably won't be making any big moves for a bit."

CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,paulzors,8,Sat Jun 27 19:14:07 2015 UTC,Would love Jeremy Lin. Would be great for our dribble penetration
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,jsmitty021,4,Sat Jun 27 14:44:19 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Lin's probably the least likely to sign here.  He wants to sign with a team that plays an up-tempo style (not Charlotte) and is the most likely to command more than the MLE.  He'll probably end up signing in a place like Dallas, where he'll be in a style that fits, compete for a starting spot, and be reunited with Parsons and (maybe) Chandler.  If I had to bet, I think the Hornets ultimately re-sign Mo Williams to the full MLE.  If he doesn't end up finding a way to go back to Cleveland, I don't think any other team will recruit him as hard as Charlotte."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,aceboogieville,2,Sat Jun 27 15:52:04 2015 UTC,I think Mo's shown the ability he can still start somewhere.  I don't think Charlotte is that place.  They tried to play Kemba & Mo together at the end of last year and I don't think it worked out well.
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,fawnguy,5,Sat Jun 27 19:17:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like Cho is gonna make some more trades before it's all said and done. The pre-draft moves felt very deliberate in the sense that they felt like they were setting up a bigger move. My guess (or rather, hope) is that Al gets traded. I'm honestly not sure what we could get in return or who would even be interested in him, though."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,nuck_futs,7,Sun Jun 28 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"Looking at that chart just reaffirms my frustration with the Vonleh trade. We gave  up a workable, cheap young player with a high ceiling for one year of Batum?  Of course, we're horrible about developing talent so I guess it's too much to assume we could have made Vonleh any good."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,GoAraJjang,2,Sat Jun 27 15:50:44 2015 UTC,"I was pretty bummed about that too. Our priorities don't seem to be youth development right now though. I was really hoping to get to see him play more minutes this year, but I wish him the best in Portland."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,Johnny_Mo88,6,Sat Jun 27 17:46:55 2015 UTC,As long as we keep Cody Zeller I don't mind whatever we do with the rest of the roster but please Jordan dont get rid of him.
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,SelflessDion,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:56:56 2015 UTC,All reports are we're shopping him hard. I think he's gone honestly if we get a good offer
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,Johnny_Mo88,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:02:47 2015 UTC,are we still shopping since the Batum trade? Haven't seen anything said one way or the other
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,corallok,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:30:01 2015 UTC,"Same. My phone was blowing up with updates saying we were shopping him. They've all but died off. Either we couldn't move him, or they're moving in silence."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,TubaMike,5,Wed Jul 1 00:15:21 2015 UTC,This is painful to me. We are shelling out 70 something million? For this roster? Does anyone think we will even make the playoffs?
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,jsmitty021,14,Sat Jun 27 15:55:10 2015 UTC,"If the format stays with 8 in the East and 8 in the West we have a very real shot of making the playoffs.  You don't really have to be that good to make the playoffs in the East.  The last time the 8th seed in the East had a winning record was the shortened '11/12 season.  The next most recent time before that was '04/05.  If the playoffs go to the best 16 overall, we're screwed."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,BobcatsHornets,7,Sat Jun 27 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the Hornets, it's pretty ridiculous that we are above the salary cap and this roster is all we have to show for it."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,rekced,6,Sat Jun 27 19:12:01 2015 UTC,we are in a bad salary spot but I think we are definitely an above .500 team for this year at least that's probably like a 3 seed in the east lol
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,BobcatsHornets,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:50:31 2015 UTC,"You think this team is better than one of the Cavs, Bulls, Wizards, Hawks, Celtics, Bucks, or Pacers? Absolutely no chance we are a top 3 seed. We'll be lucky to make the playoffs."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,Kurama1,6,Sat Jun 27 21:17:57 2015 UTC,Sorry I meant the 3 seed as a joke about how bad the east is haha should have been clearer because internet ruins sarcasm. But I do think we are definitely better than the Celtics this year and maybe as good as the Bucks depending on how good Jabari is right away. Remember they struggled a lot after losing Knight. I think we are almost certainly a 6-8 seed this year. After this season things get really murky though

CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,theriotismagic,2,Sun Jun 28 14:43:17 2015 UTC,Is Troy Daniels a reasonably good 3pt shooter? The only thing I know about him is that he's got a high 3pt rating in NBA2K15.
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,Dhalphir,3,Sun Jun 28 08:36:55 2015 UTC,"In his limited minutes here he lit it up. He only played in our last few games, but every time he was on the floor I thought WTF, why is he just now coming off the bench? It'll be interesting to see how he fits on the depth chart with Lamb now. If you compare stats, Daniels has better shooting percentages (granted it's a smaller sample size)."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,theriotismagic,3,Sun Jun 28 13:03:00 2015 UTC,A good highlgihts example  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYiMb6KA31U
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,LordHighSummoner,3,Sun Jun 28 13:14:47 2015 UTC,"Good Lord that put me in a good mood. That was our only nationally televised game. They were railing on our attrocious shooting (rightfully so), but then Troy Daniels silenced them. Haha. I'm STOKED to watch him during the summer league next week."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,BobcatsHornets,2,Sun Jun 28 13:43:40 2015 UTC,Is this what happiness and hope feels like? I feel like i did at the beginning of last season. Be gentle
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,Gibsonfan159,4,Mon Jun 29 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"We may sign some end of bench guys but I think the roster is mostly set except for some trades possibly (please make Al disappear!). Barring trades though, I hope Clifford goes with this rotation:  PG: Kemba, Roberts, FA pickup who only plays in place of injuries  SG: Batum, Lamb, Daniels  SF: MKG, 3J, Lamb/Daniels  PF: Kaminsky, Zeller, Williams  C: Al (please leave), Hawes, Bismack  I can't imagine trading for Hawes and not playing him so I would assume he plays over Biz. I'd rather trade Al and have them split minutes, though idk which is the better fir with the starters as shooting and defense are in equal demand there. I think Frank should start over Zeller because it gives room for MKG to actually drive and be an offensive weapon and Zeller would do the same in the super spacey second unit."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,BobcatsHornets,4,Sat Jun 27 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"I think Mo should get the backup PG spot. Roberts is inconsistent. Yea, Al slows down the flow coz he's too old to run the court. Not great on defense either."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,hornets1994,3,Sat Jun 27 23:54:03 2015 UTC,"I have been against bringing Mo back because I think he's just so ball dominant that he prevents our young guys from developing on the ball skills but with the new roster and the way that bench unit looks, we probably do need a guy like that. None of those players are good at creating action so I'd be cool with Mo.   As for Al, this team would do so well if we played up tempo so ya I think he needs to go."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,nuck_futs,3,Sat Jun 27 23:58:27 2015 UTC,"Ideal offseason is to trade Zeller for another wing player and sign a PG with the MLE. Some guys who come to mind are Kendall Marshall, Donald Sloan, Ish Smith, or Cory Joesph. Otherwise we need to see how Summer League goes, stay healthy and gel as a team. Maybe see if this Harrison twin could be any good as a backup PG.  I'm optimistic that we've got more coming in the next few months."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,JezuzFingerz,12,Sat Jun 27 14:56:35 2015 UTC,"I know we have way too many bigs, but I would just hate to give up Zeller."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,LordHighSummoner,7,Sat Jun 27 17:44:47 2015 UTC,I wish there was some way we could trade Marvin Williams
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,BobcatsHornets,2,Sat Jun 27 23:04:14 2015 UTC,"Seeing warriors win the championship with smallball, charlotte decides to experiment with TallBall and only signs power forwards and centers."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,jsmitty021,3,Mon Jun 29 18:17:42 2015 UTC,this Harrison is the non-PG one so I doubt it
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,jnoobs13,2,Sat Jun 27 20:49:24 2015 UTC,Hornets should have overloaded on youth with team-friendly contracts that could potentially build to something great.  Too many aged veterans being overpaid taking up space.
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,Johnny_Mo88,2,Sat Jun 27 19:15:36 2015 UTC,"Well if things don't go well this year that's around $35 million gone. Don't think retain Biyombo. He has a place in the NBA, but we have a lot of bigs now. Taylor's gone too probably."
CharlotteHornets,3bb14o,turnertornado,2,Sat Jun 27 17:32:11 2015 UTC,Yeah Taylor just hasn't been the same. Before his whole off court drama he was developing pretty nicely.
