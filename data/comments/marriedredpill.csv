Effectively, speaking through the sinus and nasal passages and speaking through the resonant frequency of your face.  http://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/11/13/masculine-voice/  Close your mouth, relax your jaw (but keep your lips closed), and hum until you can feel your nose and sinuses under your eyes vibrate.  This is your mask voice.  This is the timbre, tone, and pitch you should be speaking with.  To increase the volume you must learn to project from the diaphragm rather than from the throat.  In fact my children know they have me when I slip and ""yell"" from my throat... they know I'm in their frame and they use the fuck out of it.

Always looking to find the worst in what I say isn't going to be tolerated. We're adults, and responsible for our own feelings. If she wants to get offended by something I say, that's on her.  I know, I know - acta non verba, but it was a conversation that needed to be had, and I think it went well. Stoicism and OI if she hadn't taken it well meant I was ready to walk and continue on my journey. She knew it, and she reacted appropriately. Now we'll just have to see if I actually have been maintaining frame enough to make it happen.

She threw herself at my mercy, claiming she knows how bad she's been treating me and it's all because of her insecurity over the dread I've been implementing (unbeknownst to her.)  I said the above - that her prior behaviour was indeed absolutely unacceptable in an adult relationship, and I was done tolerating it. If that's how it's going to be, I'll get the rest of my stuff and we can both move on with our lives - all said from a place of calm, there was no anger or emotion there.  She agreed, and so I'm back to give it one last shot - but keeping OI with it.   I shouldn't have engaged her in the conversation to begin with, I agree.

Do not stop because you are tired, but because your arms can no more. Next, do two series of half that number. On the third one, do as much as you can, but still at least half of the first number. Repeat again and again. Do not forget: good posture is the only injury-free way! Good luck, you can do it. Own your shit!"
marriedredpill,3e217j,slopejeff,4,Tue Jul 21 10:17:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think I would call it a shit test.   I think you dealt with solipsism and unrealistic time management by setting a boundary and not wavering.   I do wonder if saying ""it's too much "" comes across as weak.  Maybe you couldn't do it because you had other plans would have been better.   I'm looking forward to hearing from others take on this.   Edit: do you know how to fog yet?  I waited too long to read WISNIFG and my life was harder for it.    ""You're right they are our friends and we probably don't see them as often as we could,  but I still don't want to go today."""
marriedredpill,3e217j,thisisme0007,3,Tue Jul 21 11:02:27 2015 UTC,"yup, the teenager in the room scenario. She doesn't know the logistics, just that she likes being social, and it'll work itself out (with a lot of extra work from you of course)  the only change I can see is explaining yourself less.   ""We already have plans, there isn't enough time"" should be good enough. beyond that, captain shouldn't have to explain his every action.  As for the tone thing... she's testing you there for sure. Usually on those sort, I give the old classic ""Thats not tone... I can give you tone if you want it"""
marriedredpill,3e217j,stonepimpletilists,2,Tue Jul 21 11:44:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely a Shit Test but only because anything a woman says or does can be construed as a test of your shit.  The biggest clue here is she did not start whining and become desperate for your approval and submission to her frame.  If she had, you would have a comfort test to handle- which is really just another form of Shit Test.  They will push and push and push until you give them a hard boundary.  Then they will get pissed.  Then they will get over it.  Then they will (unconsciously) realize their pussy is suddenly warm and wet.  Then they start treating you like a wife treated her husband for all of human history until about the 1960's.  Cause and effect- except women are all about the feels and don't understand cause and effect that well.   Like nothing ever happened. All i am thinking about is wow it really worked. I stood up for MYSELF for once , said no and guess what she was mad initially but eventually got overit.    Nothing DID happen!  A woman's husband stood up for himself just like he should have been all this time.  Nothing more.  The result is predictable.  Finally, don't forget:  With great power comes great responsibility.  Your wife had a good point about you not seeing your other friends.  You even agree with her.  So why not Captain up and arrange a gathering next week, or later with your friends who couldn't make it this weekend?  Not as a covert contract (if I do this my wife will be happy) but because YOU want to see your friends AND because it is nice to make your wife happy and maintain old friendships blah blah."
marriedredpill,3e217j,BluepillProfessor,0,Tue Jul 21 15:26:05 2015 UTC,Sounds like a great idea. I was thinking along the same lines but didn't want to give in at that time.
marriedredpill,3e217j,UEMcGill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:18 2015 UTC,The proof is in her actions.  Did it come off as weak?  What does her arm across your chest say?  Clarification of the mission to the FO is ok. Proof will come in the future when she tells you she turned it down because it would be too much. Keep leading and pretty soon this kind of bull shit will become a thing of the past.

marriedredpill,3e217j,theultmatecad,5,Tue Jul 21 11:06:18 2015 UTC,Agreed here. You did great but there is no reason for you to.explain anything.  Its not a shit test. Its a woman with zero regard for your free time. A woman who thinks you exisit to make her wishes come true. They are all like that if you let them.  Id have just said I am going to gym in the morning and excited to entertain at home in the afternoon. Im not going into city.  Remember..you dont control her. You control you.

marriedredpill,3e217j,bogeyd6,2,Tue Jul 21 13:09:47 2015 UTC,"You handled this about as well as someone unplugging could have handled it. You came across as weak when you said it's too much. You should have told her you already made the plans, and while you haven't seen them in a long time, you are not changing your plans. This is fogging and asserting all in one. In this instance you came across as your willingness to stick to your decisions and enhancing her perception of your leadership. While saying it's too much, because <insert your victim puke here>, and you cannot handle it may not have been the best way. It certainly isnt the wrong way though.   The best thing you did was stick to your choices and not cave to her demands. She will respect you for this. Imagine if 15 minutes later you agreed to change your plans and apologized? Lol."

I have a good woman at home, she gives me great sex(insert whatever your flavour is) looks good, takes care of herself, and generally makes my life better. I've got no reason to trade down.  Then some paternal man hugs, forehead kisses, and she acts like a 9 year old girl for a bit.  I like this approach, it's worked for me, because it has that powertalk of plausable deniability... thats how women communicate.  what you've basically said is what you expect out of the relationship, and that she needs to get on board with it, or you're moving on.  But on the surface, you are telling her how great a woman she is, and how you would never leave her. She gets to hamster those demands as parts of her identity, at which point...

The same poor wife that contributed to my pussification and denied me good sex for 10 years.  That disrespected me and gave me shit every day.

marriedredpill,3e3m7u,victi_vicimus,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you're saying. I wish you'd bring more references to the table, but I'm also partial to the science of things.  I am studying for my CSCS now and am also very passionate about physical & mental fitness. With that said, don't you agree that the physiological adaptations Men here experience will be on a case by case basis?  Some guys are 150lbs overweight while others are trying to lose the last 10lbs and are at 10% bf. Also, the intensity one approaches their workouts with will determine their rest periods(you mentioned this) so as opposed to saying you shouldn't lift 5 x's a week, wouldn't it be better to state that it is necessary to ensure rest is being given as much attention as your lifting program?"
marriedredpill,3e3m7u,TrainingTheBrain,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"First, I separate weight loss from the development of strength development.  Weight loss is at least 95% diet driven. The only practical way that working out reduces weight is by keeping you away from the refrigerator/cupboard.  The adaptations that each person receives from strength training are different, but that also relates to the differences in our genetic capability to develop muscle.  The results you get from working out are on a S-curve. you get more benefit during the first year or two of working out and then rate of muscular adaptation slows.  Those trying to lose body fat are affected by the limits to the rate of loss of body fat. In presence of a caloric deficit, you can lose about 30 calories worth of body fat for every pound of body fat you have. A greater caloric deficit results in the loss of other tissues (see Anorexia) See reference on the limits of fat oxidation.  My references for those seeking workout advice are Drew Baye and Dr. McGuff."

Bodybuilders, fitness models, guys at 10% BF, sure...  Is the average guy pre-sixpack getting any benefit? No, and probably will hinder his progress by making it more complicated than it needs to be.  Just about any program someone starting out will do will work. by the time they need to tweak it, they will most likely already know what they are doing. Just avoid injury, Form, and ignore the numbers on the weights, just worry about intensite (if you are out of breath after a set of squats, or deads, then you're doing it right)  As for the rest periods. I'll never personally be on board with 3 minutes sitting around on a bench. Supersets exist for a reason. your time is valuable, why sit there sipping an energy drink when you can work a reciprocal muscle? Your central nervous system will fail before your muscles, so I wouldn't have new guys worrying about tiring themselves out in between rows and a bench press...  I should really start adding some posts in here in the future, it's one of the few areas I'm confident about...  OPS advice is definitely useful for those who are in 'fuckable' levels of fitness already  By the time someone has to worry about looking like arnold... they probably won't be here anymore"
marriedredpill,3e3m7u,stonepimpletilists,2,Tue Jul 21 18:55:40 2015 UTC,"My idea of rest isn't related to when you are working out. I'd have you go from one set to the next within 30 seconds.  The rest I urge on you is between workouts.  The main problem with my advice for this group is that workouts are being used as a method of increasing dread through absence and as way to increase personal self confidence. These are both worthwhile, but I'd urge you to use your hobbies rather than workout time."

marriedredpill,3e3m7u,Mrbumby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:07 2015 UTC,Been reading about the 5x5 workout. Does that in your opinion give individual muscles the chance to recover to avoid the continual break down?  The reason I have thought about switching to it is to avoid working the same muscles over and over again five days a week and the 5x5 workout seems to aim to avoid that?
marriedredpill,3e3m7u,antariusz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree about the genetics.  As someone who works in a field, which is based on biochemistry/genetics and works out for over a decade, I can tell you, that genetic predisposition don't matter on a amateur level. If you're a healthy adult, your functional DNA (the one that codes for mRNA and gets translated to proteins) is mostly identical to an unrelated person.  Even so identical  that you couldn't identify a person by looking at his coding DNA. That is the reason why forensics have to look at ""simple sequence DNA"".  Wiki has a great article about that ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling )  The main reason that you won't look like  or be able to compete with Schwarzenegger, Bolt or Phlebs, is that their whole life spins around their sports: they workout multiple times a day, their food is optimized, they sleep a lot and their physiology is optimized by medical professionals.  Besides that I agree with OP. Which work out works best for you depends on so many factors (nutrition, stress level, time of the work out due hormone levels changing throughout the day...)  And if you don't get enough rest, you'll get shitty results.  @OP: you might enjoy /r/advancedfitness"

You 'cheated', and that takes time and effort to overcome.  Telling her to get over it will NEVER work.  It's exceptionally hard to get this back for her, regardless of what you think she should do.  Her hamster is going on and on, and the worst case scenarios have played in her head. Right now, you banged hundreds of women, you are acting like a dictator in every conflict, and she's reacting as such.  Pretty normal, and should be expected.   So you got that going for you.  Look, she's your wife.  She's the first mate.  You need to treat her as such, while leading her.  This is not about her not adding value to your life.  You fucked up, and haven't given her any motivation that you're past that.  If you want the marriage, then act like it.  Brooding in the car and bullying her because you're 'right' ain't the way to go about it."
marriedredpill,3e2zyn,recon_johnny,3,Tue Jul 21 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"You won the battle but it seems to me to be a Pyrrhic victory.    What have you read from the sidebar? Have you been lifting? Where is your SMV compared to your wife. Do you recognize and pass shit tests?   In arguments, do you state your position then leave or do you argue until you assert your position and dominance causing bad feelings and build up of resentment? That trip's argument and return was exactly what happened. You got your way, but it did not end up with her hamstering to appreciate your direction but rather resenting it.   What I would suggest is to read and if you already did, re-read NMMNG and MMSLP. Definitely lift. If in doubt STFU. Take care of your shit, especially manly shit in and around your house. Try being more fun. Try incorporating Agree and Amplify into responses to her toxic shit tests. Those often will make her laugh and diffuse budding arguments such as those about a fucking toothbrush. You probably spent more money on gas than you would have stopping at a CVS to get a new toothbrush.  Being cordial sucks. That's just euphemism for passive aggressiveness. Just be more fun."

There's your first conflict.  If you're going to ""stay for the kids"" then you have to decide to make it the ""super-best for you"" as well.  You can have both but it takes effort.  There's a big long victim puke here where you show us your wife can be a childish bitch.  So?  They all can be.  How many years and how far down the BP well did you fall?  We don't know but maybe it justifies her disrespect.  You dance around your occupations too, I assume it's because we'll point and laugh?  There's very little here about any RP improvements or effort.  Maybe you see how much work RP can be and you hope to convince yourself you won't have to do it..?  Sorry but even if you next your wife you'll end up at the same place with the next woman.  All of this really boils down to: get to the gym and get going improving yourself: physically, mentally, career-wise and hobby-wise.  Develop enough confidence in yourself that you can develop options.  Options for your time, for your career, and for sex.  And behold when you get there your wife will almost certainly notice and begin to respect you again.  You find yourself dealing from a position of strength, where you should have been all along."

STFU should work wonders for you, especially since you're new at this (I'm assuming).  Lighten the fuck up, dude.  More A&A and AM.  Don't get your panties in a bunch over mere words, especially if you haven't been leading like you should.  She nags because you've let her.  Don't get mad at her now, its only her natural reaction to BP marriage.  Get mad at yourself, then use that anger to forge a new life.  Also, her nagging and put-downs are a bid for drama, because women thrive on it.  When you react (even calmly), she gets her dopamine rush.  TL,DR: I can sum it up in one sentence: SHE GOT TO YOU, BRO.  Edit: to anticipate any skeptics: there is a time and a place for righteous anger towards her.

As an RP Man, you'll embrace the pain of separating and you'll use it as fuel to being an even better father to them.  Will it suck, yes. Will there be nights after you drop the kids off at Mom's for the week where you go home and want to rage/cry for missing out on things, in the beginning yes.  The question is, will you be happier in the short amount of time you have left on this Earth with your wife or without her. your kids will feel the toxic energy between the two of you and having that elephant in the room will be terrible for their upbringing.   I don't have an answer for you but from the points I read, it's time to lay out how it's going to be and make immediate changes to how this relationship is operating, or get the fuck out and own the rest of your days."

I think most of this stuff is just noise, the real issue is she has no respect for you as a father or provider, let alone a sexual man who she could lose.  You need SMV, bad. Hell, even just Value at this point will work.  She clearly thinks of you as that bag of sperm with a paycheck for raising her kids, and he's a subpar one at that. Do what you love, but damned if she doesn't see it as you being a deadbeat dad, instead of a providor. She can think what she wants, thats the one thing you are doing right.  She also doesn't think you are a good father, thats why you get passive aggressive sarcastic comments about 'oh look, the fuckup fucked up again' Might be worth a look in your life to make sure your house is in order. If you've let her take the lead most your life on the kids, then theres probably good reason for her to think so.  As for the test, she called your bluff... good job on following through, but I find your choice of conversation to be cringey..  Promise you'll be nice... or else.  No one on earth would say 'ok' and start acting nice, especially thie woman that doesn't respect you. She'll begrudgingly giving 'obligation' time and sex... beacuse thats what families do..  promise the fight was over?  Dude, you can't tell her what to do... she's got that part right, regardless of how cunty she was when she said it. focus more on you, and not on her. you can't change her, you aren't her dad (which is too bad, she starts thinking of you paternally, you'll find life a lot easier)They flip a switch all the time, like a bug hitting your windshield. it was there, and it was gone, and if you were busy you'd probably never even notice.  Get back home after this, finish reading sidebar stuff, and be glad you seem to have your shit in order, probably a few life choices will make the difference here.   Are you fit? Do you look attractive? do other girls flirt with you? If not, you got to fix that, pronto. Rule one... lift bro. As for the kids, IANAE, but you've got to start working on percieved competence. Assuming you know how to raise a kid properly, the issue is just having your family, (and her, but not showing off) ackgnowlege good dad stuff. do you take them out on your own and do dad things? When they get into trouble, do they come to you first? or her? I'd probably suggest taking them solo... and a lot more often. If she thinks you're a shitty dad, then she doesn't get to complain when you don't want someone sabotaging you while you're having fun with the guys, she can be a miserable shrew at home, alone... Because be damned if you're skipping icecream day for that crap. finance wise... are you good with money? you've obviously taken the hit to income for your personal well being... everyone would applaud you for that... but if you're also the guy who spends like a sailor, and kicks finanical responsabilities down the road, this is going to be key. I'm not talking about 'buying the house that she deserves' or any nonsense, but you definitely shouldn't be struggling because you can't balance a checkbook, and are too stubborn to sort out your childrens future. Just make sure you've acting to the standard you've set for yourself.   As for the boundries... I remember reading a lot on here, your dread should be commensurate with your SMV. you seem to be good at laying down boundries (a little too 'you do X' focused, but thats a small change to get to 'I won't put up with X') If the first thing you get on your boundries is insubordination, then it's a clear signal to you that you're not the prize... yet.  As for the balance there, justwork on it. you'll get a ton of shit tests while you're that asshole deadbeat dad, but you'll see them dwindle as you start looking good, getting pre selection, and running your house properly.  Or she's just a greedy cunt who wants a packmule to bring her gold, in which case you won't feel bad about turning her into the 'you can have them the other 6 months' mother. But if you don't have your shit together, you'll still be that same deadbeat for the next girl.  Kids are a logistical hurdle to overcome, not a reason to stay together. They can come back after being child soldiers, dad leaving the nagging wife won't break em"

It was awfully disrespectful IMO.  I am reading the sidebar stuff and making changes. This is one of them. Before I would have never said anything about the ridiculous overpacking.

The increased sex, respect, and enjoyment of life are byproducts of becoming what you were born to become, a Man.  In a situation as bad as yours, I would be totally upfront. Take your actions through lifting weights and reading more (I have been listening to A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy on audiobook and can't recommend it enough. Take charge of your nutrition. Openly tell her that you're done living like this and you want you and her to cook some healthy meals together. Enjoy your wife, don't resent her, it's your fault you became fat and weak not hers, so don't project your anger from your self to her. Have fun in the kitchen, get her onboard the fitness train, and let her know that you're done being a weaksauce husband. Then don't discuss it again.  Usually I recommend you just doing these things without informing her, but you're so far out of shape and sexless that I think you need to get the air cleared and then you start improving without ever looking back.  Again, don't be disgusted by your wife. She's still with you after you blew up and she was forced to take the wheel. She embodies the woman you love, she's not the embodiment of your shit mistakes."

This is just as important as the body, and you can start working on this today as well. WISNIFG is a great book for getting your mind in order.  Someone posted a comment in another thread that sounds like it sums up your marriage too. Paraphrasing ""1. your wife isn't into you sexually, but 2. she's still into the marriage enough to have occasional sex with you to keep the relationship going"".  Number one you can work on with diet, fitness, and attitude. Number two means there's still a starting point to repair things.  As for initiating... initiate if you want to, don't if you don't. Sometimes it's really just that simple.  If in doubt, err on the side of initiating but don't get butthurt if she doesn't take your lead all the time."

I called it the cave man diet - leaves and grass, nuts and berries, and meat.    Just cutting the soda and junk food, I dropped 10 lbs almost immediately.    Then started walking - 2 miles per day.  Core exercises and stretching - every day, Biking - started slow with several 5 mile bikes, then 10 miles, then 15 miles, then 25 miles.  The last 5 miles I really push.  Added weight training to beef up - every other day.    Results; flatter stomach, less grunting when sitting down standing up, better posture, better control and harder dick when fucking.

Then it gets harder but at that point you will be attractive enough for other women to notice you and by proxy your wife as well (preselection.) I started mid February at 190, I got down to 159 on May 21st. That's roughly 2 pounds per week. Since then I lost 10 pounds or roughly a pound per week and I'm at 14.8% body fat at 149 pounds. Yeah skin and bones but I do have some muscle definition already, just trying to get rid of last vestiges of fat from my stomach. Once I hit 10% (roughly couple more months or by the end of summer) I'll start bulking.  The more weight you have the easier it is to lose a lot in the beginning. Just count your calories, drink allot of water (not soda or juices or coffee with cream and sugar), eat protein heavy food such as greek yogurt, eggs, turkey, chicken, pork loin, steak, couple it with lots of veggies and you will see the weight melt right off. My fitness pal is one of the best apps to help you reach your goal weight. At 2 pounds per week, you could safely reach 170 pounds in 32 weeks. Add a few weeks for Thanksgiving and Christmas and your will be beach ready right in time for next summer.  Regarding your wife, she will come around once you remove covert contracts, start taking care of your shit and outstanding stuff around the house and she sees progress with your weight. You can't blame her for losing attraction to your beta self. Improve and see her come around. If not, you can always next her. As always that call is up to you."

marriedredpill,3e2qo9,TMRPNEWBIE,4,Tue Jul 21 14:40:20 2015 UTC,"My wife dealt with it after our child.  In my opinion, the #1 thing is to make sure she gets enough rest. Sleep will do incredible things to the body and it needs it after what she went through.  If this is your first child, then I'll give you advice I wish we had internalized. An infant sleeps around 18-20 hours a day. While SIDS and the like are cause for concern, she needs to sleep and rest as much as possible...you don't need to stare at the thing while it sleeps. You'll hear it when it cries and wakes up."

marriedredpill,3e2qo9,UnluckyPenguin,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:28 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give you my opinion on the subject and my experience with anxiety as well as that of my wife.  Your wife has gone through an extreme physical and mental change these past few months. Her body gained weight, she has another life to care for, and she is no longer 'defined' by her profession.  To keep this somewhat brief, I will get right to the point.  The answer is for her to find joy and contentment in what she is doing. PPD is a real thing, from what I've read and researched. I don't have the science or citations to back that up, but from my understanding it is a physiological issue that is fucking real.  But, I think it can be mitigated and cured through specific actions on the part of the mother as well as those who she has for support (you). Getting her to find joy in what she does around the house, getting her to find joy in the sleepless nights and constant 'presence' of the child during the day. She is a Mother she has given life to another human and without her efforts you would not be able to do what you do. She needs to see that.  It's like the guys who are in the military have the complex of 'Not doing enough' because they weren't SEALs. Everyone has a role to play, without her taking charge of the home and rearing the child, you'd be fucked with your job and therefore the family would end up in poverty.  You need to lead and be that Oak now more than you ever have before. With both of our kids I never told my wife I was tired, I never told her it was too much, and I never took my foot off the gas with self improvement.  Continue to lead your clan and make sure that you are taking a share of the burden. Grab the kid and bring it somewhere so she can sleep, workout, clean, relax, bathe, fucking whatever. You are a Father and you need to be a Masculine presence in the household.  The single greatest discovery that I came across was from this sub. A few users here, mainly /u/strategos_autokrator turned me on to Stoicism and it is exactly what I needed. Looking back I was brought up with many of the teachings that this 'Life Philosophy' promotes, so I was able to more quickly apply it to my life.   Since then my wife has also taken a major interest in the subject and together we have made some serious fucking growth on the 'spiritual' side of our relationship. Removing the unessential and finding joy in this life all while mitigating the negative emotions sounds like something that may greatly benefit your wife.  I wouldn't come in throwing The Enchiridion or The Meditiations at her. But, before resorting to medication, I would approach the subject and explain that this is something you guys will do together and work together to solve and that she can be open and free in explaining things to you.  Having her shutdown is the worst that can happen and if she feels that she's losing you to this issue, she'll hold it in and that black cloud inside will grow.  Acta, Non Verba - stay vigilant brother."

I mean really lead it and take ownership of the household, her anxiety slowly decreased.  It took several months but I never hear her complain about it any longer.  In her head she knew that she didn't have to worry about deciding what to make for dinner, where to eat, when to leave etc... it was a huge weight off her shoulders.

You have to be a tad more rock-like, be positive, lift her up and encourage her occasionally, and don't let yourself get discouraged when she shoots you down. Does she breastfeed? It's probably too late by now, but for future reference breastfeeding GREATLY reduces ppd, as well as crests better nurture bonding between kid and mom.   And then there's the basic depression cures: moderate exercise, eating healthy, getting fresh air regularly, spending time with friends and daily that support her.   Good luck."

marriedredpill,3e2fgp,stonepimpletilists,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:57 2015 UTC,Do you actually believe you should even care? You have alot of redpill swallowing to go son. Stop hamstering on how her actions are affecting you. It's supposed to be the other way around.
marriedredpill,3e2fgp,bogeyd6,2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:03 2015 UTC,That seems to be my glass jaw for everything. Is there some way I can retain my empathy for people but not be like this? Or is that something about myself I need to learn to switch off?
marriedredpill,3e2fgp,bogeyd6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"Fake it till you make it. I still care about my wife, and some things she does pisses me off to no end. Of course, I get tired of the constant fucking shit tests every single fucking day. Leading ain't easy. If it was, everyone would do it.  You are the captain. You chose the redpill. All that was offered was the truth. Now you changed these lives and its your responsibility.  What can you do tho specifically? Act stoic. Work on your poker face. Try not to show your emotions to her. Eventually as you work on yourself this stuff will start becoming second nature."
marriedredpill,3e2fgp,Metalaggeddon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:11:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. Though it's less switching off and more how you choose to focus your energies effectively.   I have always cared about my ltrs, that's a primary reason why I allowed that status, and no, I'm not an empath, actually I'm rather dissociative and narcissistic. Almost purely sociopathic. This will be a long one, premises then conclusion in tldr.   However when I do care I care a lot. There's a hard limit you have to set though. Let's write an argument shall we?   You care about her.   Caring about her implies your happiness is continent on hers in some way.   If your happiness is contingent on hers, it's a causal force in your happiness.   If something is a casual force in your happiness you should attempt to control that casual force to the best of your ability.   It is impossible to have 100% control over an external force.   Since it is impossible to have 100% control you must accept your lack of control. (to maintain your maximum happiness).   Accepting your lack of control over her does not necessarily mean not protecting your causal force. (since it does impact your happiness).   In order to control something which cannot be controlled, that force must choose your control. (handing you the reigns).   In which case you must supply am atmosphere more beneficial to the causal forces motivations than what that causal force can otherwise find.   To supply an atmosphere you must control as much as you can about it.   Previously stated, you have little control externally, focus purely internally, as it is the only thing you can guarentee to prove a more preferred atmosphere. (most cost effective rout).   Therefore, Acting selfishly to improve yourself and disregard the things you can't control (her)  actually increases the atmosphere you can provide consistently more than any other method.   Or,  TL/DR if you care, you should be selfish in your improvement and focus.   Anyone else is being unfair to both parties,(or at least very much less efficient)"
marriedredpill,3e2fgp,Metalaggeddon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:15 2015 UTC,This is helpful. But me being an empath goes beyond her. I feel empathy for EVERYONE. I don't feel that us vs them thing. I would only be capable of that if there was a literal THEM that was actively trying to harm an US. If I was a soldier I'd worry about the families of every man I've killed. It would haunt me. I wish I was a sociopath sometimes because it seems less exhausting. I blow a lot of energy into speculation. I'm wired that way. But how do I start to undo it?
marriedredpill,3e2fgp,cholomite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"I wasn't talking about just her.   Scan it again and replace her with anyone in your life, see if it comes to a different conclusion.   As far as how to begin application, this'll make you uncomfortable for a month. But just do you. Be entirely selfish in the way described, and see if those you care about aren't more happy. Just do it. I'd happily place money on the results being positive."
marriedredpill,3e2fgp,angels_fan,2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"This seems like a non-issue. I would be focusing more on how she behaves towards you. It seems like she's doing everything you want, and if you support her wearing a headscarf then I don't see a problem."

Here's the thing. A thing you have to drill into your head to let go of: those past 17.5 years.  You had your victim puke. Your purging...totally understandable. I'm not going to beat you up over the length of time. Some of us it take 2 years to have enough, 8 years or in your case 17.5 years.   But you had enough. You aren't getting those 17.5 back of a good sex life. They're gone. Mourn it's loss like you would a family dog. But compartmentalize it and let it go. Now that it's gone you can start TODAY to resolve to not be there for the next X years.  Good move not moving out of the bedroom. Of course, she was happy with the status quo...she had all her needs met without needing to meet the needs of her beta male.   Read, get your map in order, undo that tension in your chest, head and gut that you've been silently carrying around for so long. Breath deep, smile and start a new you.  When you feel better deep down you can choose to start gaming your wife. It's usually the smarter move financially and for the kids under 18. If not, get your shit in order, ass covered and book out. Although you may be surprised she could step it up when she sees the handwriting on the wall is in permanent marker and not tentative pencil.  She may be there at the end of it, or not, at this part the chick can hang on or fall off the back.  Good luck. And welcome back to your manhood."
marriedredpill,3e3c0z,Countpudyoola,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"17.5 was deadbedroom   These statements blow my mind every fucking time. What the fuck happened for you to accept shit sex for so long?  Not that it matters, I'm just asking how you get that deep into a rut.  You've been taught to bottle up your masculinity and all of the powerful emotions that come with it, you discovered TRP and now recognize what's happened to you and it created a crack in your BluePill foundation.   This is the result of that BluePill foundation crumbling. You've now exposed your 'Alpha' skin and hopefully you'll continue to wear it.  Whether it should have been handled 18 years ago or not makes no difference. You've made the decision to improve today, continue to do that and do not be disgruntled for time lost.  Feeling angry or frustrated will detract from the joy you've exposed yourself to. Now, you are a Masculine Man who will act and live as such. Whether you decide to stay with the wife or not is up to you. Regardless of that decision, continue to own your shit, read more, and get yourself into the best shape of your life."

I see you wrote that there have been hugs and kisses since then. Has there been actual sex or is the bedroom still dead?  Edit: I can't imagine such a long time. Mine was dead for about 3 months (after 17 years together, 12 married) before I discovered the red pill. Before then it was once or twice a month which I wasn't happy with but as a blue pill through and through I was resigned to. Since TRP I've had sex 4-5 times a week until I got her pregnant. Now I get more blowjobs than sex but I do get something at least once or twice a week."
marriedredpill,3e3c0z,itstartstoday123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:17 2015 UTC,"I thought about this recently.  I know I fought hard before slipping into the beta prostrate position 4-5 years ago. Guilting my wife for sex, bargaining for sex, all the manipulative womanly ways to get things done. I screamed, I begged and got my sex one way or another.  I read about the MK ultra program recently and how they broke people through depriving them of basic needs like sleep, food, silence, and any resemblance of human interaction. Subjects would beg and plead for anything resembling there needs. Sex is a basic need for men.   I had that break about 4 or five years ago and had the opposite break about a week ago. My wife tells me she wants sex. I think great I'm ready for that. She gets on her phone and I head to bead. She says ""I thought you wanted sex"".  Me: I did ten minutes ago, but I have other things I have to pay attention to and waiting for sex is not on my priority list. You can seduce me tomorrow if your lucky(butt hurt response)   Her: how about I seduce you right now?   Me: it's gonna take an amazing blow job to convince me at this point. (trying to take power back)   She comes over and tries to go straight to sex. I tell Her no blow job no sex. She chooses neither and walks away. Starts a fight by saying I'm being unreasonable and an asshole(that word is flying around the house a little more these days). She follows it up by saying if I'm gonna act like that she'll just cut off sex for 6 months. I smile and said fine by me and if she is gonna be that sort of wife then she'll get no interaction, comfort, affection, or money from my hard earned efforts. Followed it up with a look at my watch and a ""see you in January!"" I hear her going through the closet expecting her to come out with a bag packed to leave.   Five minutes later she comes in and stands right in front of me and I tell her she is early, as its not January yet.   Blow job, sex,  and off to sleep.   Keep going man. I know I have much improvement even just in this interaction but keep reading hard and fast and don't be afraid of her. She's not your mom or your prison guard(although it may feel like it at times). You'll get it, best mindset advice I have been given is IOI. It has changed so much around my house since adopting it. IOI cuts Her feelings out of the picture and takes Her manipulation off the table as an effective tool. Hit the gym, read and read, and accept that being unhappy is bullshit.  Side note: I looked in the closet today, she was packing. I asked her about it and she said ""oh honey, it's nothing, don't worry about it"" and starts unpacking it. Not sure about that."

I don't know if its some kind of covert shit test , or general ignorance of life around her.   That's for you to figure out. When I read, The Hobbit, The Meditations, Fire at the Gates, War & Peace and a few others, I was always reading.   But, it was never at the expense of others. If your lady is ignoring the kids then it's a problem. If she is reading whenever nothing is going on, then maybe she's into the books. You can't fault someone for falling into another realm.  When I read, it's for me and it's after I've earned the right to read. I've done what needed to be done, and while reading can be classified as something you 'need' to do, it can happen whenever.   So, analyze your situation and see if she's reading to avoid you/responsibilities/life or is she reading when she doesn't really need to do anything else."

I was very impressed when my wife started scouring my bookshelf and grabbed The Meditations. She keeps sending me Stoic articles and things she finds on the subject of having a Philosophy of Life.

These are a guess, but I'll bet you start looking at this book reading like a good thing, and use the newfound free time to get your shit together, you'll start to like the lack of dependancy on you.  You talk about the situations like they are all probelms. but problems how? for what?  What is it that the reading does, that should be elsewhere?

When you take an honest approach to analyzing your marriage from the objective vice subjective viewpoint, this passage smooths out the toughest wrinkles of What if.  What if I hadn't gotten Married at such a young age.  What if I found TRP/MRP before Marriage  What if...  None of these things matter. What matters is that you fully commit yourself to doing everything you can in your current situation.  It doesn't matter that you 'missed out' on a possible better life because:  A. You can't change the past, crying over that fact is completely weaksauce and unmasculine  &  B. You don't know if your life would have ended up any better. Your enjoyment of life comes from within, not your exterior circumstances. (See James Stockdale).  You are in the here and now, Marriage is a part of your life as, YOU decided to Marry.  Own it, accept your position and improve in every facet, to include your relationship on the personal level. Sure, you're husband and wife and maybe you're Mom and Dad. But, are you still lovers? Are you still friends going down this path together?  If you TRULY want out, then leave. Accept the pain and use it as fuel to getting to that next stage in your path of life. But, if you are committed to making it work and you want to be married...  You need to remove the What ifs."

marriedredpill,3dy28t,articulatefit,11,Mon Jul 20 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"I tell you what I think- Where the hell are my old man's letters telling me marriage is a losing proposition for a man?  I think it is a succinct description of marriage in modernity.  And I thought this line:  No man, however truly he loved his betrothed and bride as a young man, has lived faithful to her as a wife in mind and body without deliberate conscious exercise of the will, without self-denial.   speaks volumes.  To take it a step further, I think we often times tie a covert contract to this self denial.   ""I've never cheated on my wife"" - is a mantra we repeat to ourselves.  This mantra is usually followed by a feeling of indebtedness from the wife or life in general.  We are ""owed"" for this self-denial even though we knew the rules when we chose to get married.  Sometimes, the psychology from MRP flat pisses me off.  So many covert contracts in my behavior of the past, it seems like I'll never leave them behind."
marriedredpill,3dy28t,Blackthorn8,4,Mon Jul 20 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"Nearly all marriages, even happy ones, are mistakes: in the sense that almost certainly (in a more perfect world, or even with a little more care in this very imperfect one) both partners might have found more suitable mates.   Ouch!  There is always a better deal down the road but there is honor and integrity in addition to opportunity cost."
marriedredpill,3dy28t,BluepillProfessor,3,Mon Jul 20 16:37:37 2015 UTC,"We don't often look at love in terms of self-denial, but considering the popularity of Stoicism in MRP, I think this is an important perspective. What do y'all think?   What is Love?  I think a lot of us spurn the very concept of ""love.""  It's ethereal in nature and fleeting fro her; Haddaway never did get his answer: What is love?  For a woman love is:   A strong alpha male who leads her, is dominant to her, and pays just the right amount of attention (read: good, solid, caveman sex) and doles out resources sparingly. A weak beta man who provides her with resources, attention, caring and time. some combination of the two.   And this is just me guessing at this.  Her definition changes as she sees fit, when she sees fit, and then she will warp the definition to fit her circumstances, I love you, but I'm not in love with you. or ""I like these things that come with you, but not you as a person."" This of course coming at the heels of her finding Chad who she is currently ""in love with.""  Her definition of love changes with the person.  Whenever my wife says, ""I love you."" I can't help but be skeptical about what she is actually saying.  Society and media have programmed her to say these words but she doesn't really know what they mean.  But then TRP does know and as impersonal as it sounds, I love can be distilled down to this: Love is that feeling manifest and resulting from the surges of dopamine and oxytocin that makes her feel both excited but safe.  Note that I keep using ""her"" and ""she"" in context of the terms of love.  Maybe I subscribe too heavily to stoicism.  Maybe I'm a sociopath.  Maybe I'm a monster.  But, for me, ""love"" is an abstract feeling.    A Man's Love is Time and Energy  I don't feel at people.  I choose who is worth my time and I make that sacrifice of time and effort for that person; this is truly the most I have to offer anyone at all.  Under these circumstances you could say that my definition of love changes by the person too.  I would disagree.  When the person changes -when they no longer present themselves as someone who is worth my time and effort- then they no longer get those things from me.    My definition hasn't changed, but perhaps I have changed and she is becoming shittier because of the shitty container I'm providing.  Her solipsism tells her that I don't love her anymore.  Her solipsism tells her that she is the same person and I have changed.  I, and other men, suffer from our own brand of solipsism wherein we believe she has changed and we are the same.  This is blue-pill thinking.  This is not stoic.  This is not maintaining agency over our actions.  Marriage as Self-Denial is Unhealthy  I don't think we see ""love"" as self-denial; I think we see marriage as self-denial, but only if we see it through blue lenses.    Entering marriage as a BP means you believe you are entering into some sacred institution and there is no self-denial because how could you want anyone other than your special unicorn snowflake?  After all she eats glitter and shits rainbows!  Entering marriage as an RP means you are tired of spinning plates, tired of maintaining a soft harem, tired of putting time and effort into women who ultimately don't deserve it.  The ideal reason RPs enter marriage is that they do it with the knowledge that the woman they pick has been the highest-quality woman he has ever found.  The real reason is that he marries her because she is the highest-quality woman who entered the graph at the peak of his time and effort expenditure, just before it was about to fall again.  Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious; both are disappointed. -- Oscar Wilde  Ultimately he must understand that the woman he marries is still fleeting, but the rewards of devoting time and effort to this one person is better than the rewards of divvying it up among a slew of much lower-quality women.  Love is Self-Denial  Seeing marriage through red lenses means we don't see a marriage as self-denial of other women.  If we are seeing marriage as self-denial then we are admitting that we are not happy and we are forcing ourselves to be unhappy.  This is not the basis of self-denial.  Stoic self-denial is a temporary situation we practice to help us understand our limits and our capabilities.  Proper self-denial always comes with the attached ability to stop.  Remember, if we are unhappy, it is our own fault.  Self-denial is a conscious effort to be unhappy for a temporary time so that we may see the things that do make us happy more clearly.  If marriage, a legally binding one at that, is self-denial, then marriage is a self-induced permanent period of unhappiness.  If you see marriage as a permanent state of unhappiness, then you shouldn't be married; your time and effort expenditure graph is still on the rise and you don't want to bring her along for the ride, but you have to, because you've locked yourself into that situation.  This is the basis unhealthy behavior.  Self-denial is healthy as long as you can stop it at any time.  Since ""love"", a man's love -that is his time and effort- can be devoted to someone and then withdrawn, love is self-denial.  He will learn the type of woman who deserves his time and effort -his love- and the type of woman who doesn't.  This is the proper application of self-denial; he creates an unhappy situation, exists in it for a moment, and learns from it.  Epilogue  The reality of all this is that her love is inconsequential as far as what she thinks the definition is.  Ultimately she will respond the the definition you provide through your actions.  She may see love as wanting to be ""rescued"" or doted on.  You, being an RP man, see this as vapid and stressful and you ignore her.  Your love is withdrawn from her and, depending on your frame, she comes back to you with an altered sense of what she sees as love.  Now she no longer needs to be rescued, and she likes attention, but doesn't get mad when you aren't doting on her; she's learned that the attention you do give her, when you give it, is high quality, dopamine-inducing, tingly attention that she loves far more than the oxytocin-inducing, low-buzz feeling your doting may provide.  From a non-legal practical standpoint, a marriage doesn't require the paperwork that says you are legally bound.  A ceremony might be a nice delimiter between the phases in the relationship (if that's your thing... and who doesn't like a party?) and it might bring catharsis to what was and what now is.  In my head, a woman who is willing to do this in lieu of a legal marriage is a mark of a high quality woman; she gets the meaning and is eschewing the rest.  However, from a legal practicality, marriage, at least in the US, brings tax benefits, credit benefits, powers of attorney, medical decisions, etc.  Some states offer these for common-law or domestic partnerships but nothing seals the deal like a legal contract.  So if marriage is your thing, do it: but if you feel it's somehow a practice in self-denial, whether the marriage is a legal one or not, then you shouldn't be marrying her or anyone until that feeling stops.    In the meantime: Get a hobby, build something, and lift!"

Read Dalrock.  This is the common Churchianity trope.  If you believe in the Holy Trinity and confess that Jesus is the Son of God then you might want to acquaint yourself with how God dealt with His people when they turned from him.  You know about the Old Testament?  How about the Book of Judges?    When they turned from Him, God abandoned His people.  When they were disobedient and turned from away from God's face He let them be destroyed and brutalized by their enemies over and over and over again.  He let their children be murdered.  He let them be enslaved.  He let the women be raped.  He looked away and allowed Genocide to happen, repeatedly.  THAT is your sacrificial love of Christ.  You can argue that you should never stop loving her, but church discipline used to be an actual thing rather than the total bullshit Jesus is my mousy little beta, eternally living, all forgiving boyfriend who loves me no matter what I do.  Umm, no.  Just like women have lied to us about what they want sexually in a man, they lied to us about the real person of Jesus.  He was not a mousy little beta boy.

But as I said, the flesh is a difficult thing. I enjoy reading the MRP forum as it's been extremely insightful to me and I've learned a lot about the nature of women. The truths that have been articulated by many here make so much sense even though at first I found it counter intuitive.  Now I realize that many aspects of RP and Christianity are not mutually exclusive.  But, that's my point also. You cannot please God by living according to the flesh. And of course this stuff works because it's addressing the carnal nature of a woman. All I am claiming is that in a world lived according to Jesus' principles, none of this would even be necessary.  Regarding Jesus' nature, He has many names. Yes, he's the Lamb of God, but as DanKwan mentioned, He's also the Lion of Judah. He's merciful, but He also allows for free will, and unfortunately there are many who use that free will to do evil.  I would say that the deprived nature of man is one of the most verifiable things we could measure.  What you're missing is that He's also just and justice is one of His hallmarks.    Jesus' sacrifice was of His own volition. He said that He gave His life freely and that no one took it from Him. Can you think of anyone holding frame better than that?!

I prefer to see the reality of the situation: Jesus got threatened daily and had to defend himself, daily.  Jesus was not a mousy man at all.  A man who is basically a walking fight club asking for all-comers is a chiseled human weapon of a man.  A man like that knows things about himself and others that men who turn the other cheek will never know."

Tolkien's words are paraphrasing sentiments expressed by King Solomon, a man famed for having had hundreds of wives and concubines. The RP concepts still apply, monogamy or not.  The core point Tolkien is making is that a man tends to perceive his relationship success in terms of having made a good choice or poor choice.   The pill is hard to swallow, because it gives us certainty that we made a poor choice when we selected our lover. The lesson of the pill is that it won't help to go out and find another lover - we must transform ourselves.  Back to your original, valuable point: I would add to your point that beyond simply assuming that happy marriage is always monogamy; many of us here also have a personal bias to believe that transforming ourselves will be enough; and that we will not need to find a new lover. But the pill teaches us it may be enough or it may not be enough, but either way it turns out, we are at least better off for having swallowed the pill and transformed ourselves."

There was no ambivalence to our agreement when it came to monogamy.  This part of our contract wasn't made in bad faith.  For me to say otherwise would be lying to myself and my wife.

If part of the contract is deceptive, the contract is in bad faith. Your monogamy was a large part of your payment in the contract. This is like signing a contract to buy great land, finding out it's actually swampland, and defending your decision by saying ""there was no ambivalence to our agreement when I said I would pay $100k for the land, that part of our contract wasn't made in bad faith.""

I understood there was an expectation of monogamy for both parties.  That expectation has been met by both parties.  There's no hamstering here.  For me, it is absolutely a matter or morality.  Holding to your end of an agreement is something that is not morally ambiguous to me.  It seems clear cut.  I don't see this conversation going a lot further.

This was all i did the first month until I was recognizing shit tests and could think clearly enough to answer them fast with answers that would be positive for me.  Shutting the fuck up is good most of the time and is almost always better than not recognizing the test.  For instance you didn't say ""ok"", ""Thank you"" or ""I won't""."

While this is a good way to handle someone like your SO. She would respond better to pushing through the shit tests.  Think about it like this:  You tried to come on to her, she refused, and you went and did  something else. You made the mission not her the mission. Kudos. Hamster goes into overdrive and doing back flips. She doesn't know what to do so she initiates the sex as she knows its the only thing she has to offer.  Now think about it like this:  She shit tests you and your frame on the porch while having a good time. She is checking for beta hoping to find alpha. She successfuly resisted your advances. She wants the man where sex ""just happened"". Well of course it doesn't just happen. Power through the shit tests and deploy your kino and game. Seduce her. Thus your are cementing your role as the leader and she just got power fucked by her alpha male."

Learning how to kiss her again is interesting.  also of note - I bought her flowers the next day (rewarding good behavior with comfort) - atleast I thought it was a good move. She immediately asked how much it cost, and complained she had no place to put it. atleast I kept my cool and dropped it - but boy can I see the negative response to beta now...."

I'm expecting downvotes here because MRP considers this a ""win"" because you fucked your wife but I see it as her giving her pouty baby sex. I'm exaggerating a bit but I think the ""now you don't need to leave like that anymore"" is evidence to support my claims.  I think you're lying to yourself a bit on this OI.

You've been lied to your entire life, and now you've awakened to the stark reality of life.  Everything you've been told that women are attracted to is simply a lie.  They are actually quite repulsed by it, although they don't typically even know it themselves.  Women are like children.  They THINK they want candy for dinner and to stay up until 3am, but when they get what they want, they are tired, cranky and have a tummy ache.  What they want rarely coincides with what they need, which is a strong alpha male that will lead them.  Watch what they do, not what they say.  A woman will say she wants a sensitive man, who talks to her and understands her feeeeeeelz, but then is altogether dissatisfied and disgusted with this same man.  A strong man is quite often called an asshole, but the attraction is undeniable.  So, yes, it can change.  But it's hard fucking work on your part.  You have a long road.  Don't expect it to change overnight."

No, you can expect a better sex life when you swallow the red pill and work hard to become more attractive and less unattractive.   It looks weird to me, because it is against much of how I've learned to treat women.    Yes it is strange yet it works.  Bitches be crazy....   I've always seen a relationship, marriage in this case, to be an adventure, balanced between two equal beings.   Because that is what they told you to think.  Step out on your own and see reality.  An ""equal marriage"" (which they all say they want) = /r/deadbedrooms.  Women want you to lead the relationship from the first conversation to the last fuck.  A relationship with the husband leading = lots of sex."

About hobbies: I do trail running and I am active in a club (by active I mean I am part of the board and I coach the kids). Two days a week my evenings are about taking care of the club, and this is outside home, of course."
marriedredpill,3dyl0m,KyfhoMyoba,5,Mon Jul 20 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"Good.  Yo are active.  Bad. You don't lift.  Whatever thoughts you have in your head about how ""lifting is a waste of time"" or ""I hate the types of guys who lift"" or whatever... knock that shit off.  This is going to hit you hard:  You need to replace most of your running with lifting.  Take out 3-4 days of running and replace them with 1.5 hours of lifting each day... with no running.  The rest of the running should be tempo and/or HIIT work.  Running builds lean, low-mass bodies designed for running.  While humans are running animals and this type of body would be well used on the Savannah, 20,000 years ago, chasing animals with spears, we are not on the Savannah, it is not 20,000 years ago, and we are not chasing animals and women don't even think about how your body is probably the one best designed for bringing home the most food (resources.)  However... occasionally the village hunters need to be the village warriors and warriors also need to be built to withstand hand-to-hand combat.   What women do respond to is abs, pecs, shoulders, and arms; women are superficial and easily programmed by media.  Your first goal should be get bigger and stronger.  Until you have a proper masculine body, you will not be seen as a properly masculine man.  Once again: PM me if you need a proper plan."

This is about changing you, not about changing your wife.  We can't promise that it's going to be your wife.  Most women seem to come along with the plan and adapt, some will resist and give up power kicking and screaming but eventually yield but a few will just refuse to do anything.

These women can be found leading the pack at /r/RedPillWomen.  Many of these women recognize the RP world and know that they can't make a man change, but they can create an environment that allows him to change.  These women are rare.  they are naturally feminine, submissive, and respect and respond to traditional gender roles.  These women will defend her man because the respect of her man is more important than the respect that anyone else can give.  You may not tingle her all the time, but it's enough to make her know you are the one.  She would love it if you knew she knew that... but she can't tell you, so she nudges you.  If you found TRP and she found out you did, she'd be thrilled and supportive but would never mention it; the journey is yours alone.  The main event is non-existent.  She's in on the secret so she won't try to dissuade you in any way. 10% want you to change but don't know what to do.  They ""love"" you and would never cheat on you, and while you don't quite do it for them all the way they would do anything to get you to that point.  These women are also feminine and submissive by nature but are probably more independent then the top 5%.  She may have been an only child too.  If you found TRP and she found out you did (reading an open browser window) she'd heave a sigh of relief and tell herself, finally he's getting it.  The main event only comes if you take it too far with the dread and the main event will likely be more comfort-test filled than shit-test filled. 70% will adjust accordingly, seamlessly, and comfortably.  These women are generally feminine by nature and love being submissive to the right man.  But act like a strong and independent woman  to the general public.  The ""main event"" is typically small and low-energy.  The shit tests are few and far between or are so weak as to not even be noticed.  Comfort tests come more often. 10% will fight you on every change.  She will concede eventually, but she won't like it.  You can never slip up with her.  Giving her an inch makes her take a mile or more.  She will shit-test you often.  She often identifies as a feminist, has many feminist friends, has feminist FB groups.  This group seems more prone to cheating than any other.  That's part of the ""empowered, sexually-liberated woman"" ideal feminism entails.  Hamsters run strong in this one.  The main event might be enough to make you want to divorce. 5% won't change at all and/or flat out refuse to accept you at all.  You'll figure this one out quickly.  She's likely just a bitch through and through.  Nothing makes her happy, she complains about everything.  She's at the bottom 5% of this list because she's likely the bottom 5% of women in general.  With this type of woman you may already be cheating on her and may already be doing many RP things without knowing; most men do when pushed to the edge.  She's probably cheating on you, you probably already know.  She's prone to wild shifts in mood and behavior.  There is no main event because everyday is a main event.  No matter what you do she won't get better she will simply amplify her shitty behavior.  Everything she does is driven from place of negative emotions.  (Why did you marry this woman again?)"

Obviously, they all start with that same viewpoint of /relationships but I'm sure the reason they're not banning the shit out of RPers is because they had some success stories... and let's face it, if people started going on there and saying ""i ate dogshit for a week and now my wife blows me daily,"" people would do it."

How many hours does she work?  Scenario 2 is not a shit test. That's her just not having much respect for you. You have let things slide long enough that she is treating you like one of the kids. You need to take care of your shit and not leave things 90% done. If you do it, do it right the first time. If she finds something that you haven't noticed then don't allow her to berate you.  Scenario 3 is a shit test. When she does say ""You just want me for sex"" the correct answer is to agree and amplify. You can disagree and say I also want you for your cooking skills or some funny shit that might tick her off or make her laugh. Either way, be confident, look good (by lifting) and keep it light.   Having said that, in I've been guilty of asking if she wants to have sex myself. I usually do it when I'm tired myself and don't feel like initiating. Yesterday when she said no I was kind of relieved. I turned around said (I'm taking my toys and going home) she laughed and I fell asleep as soon as I closed my eyes."

I would never let anyone bitch at me in my own home.  It's one thing if you made an error in your housework and she points it out.  But bottom line, the second that tone goes from a suggestion to a scold, demand, anything other than a respectful request for a change in behavior, you can get the fuck out of my house.    Some might disagree with me, it might be considered breaking ""frame"" but no one will come into my house and tell me to do anything much less bitch at me.  That sounds ludicrous to me.    Sometimes I think we make shit more complicated than it needs to be.  Your wife is walking all over you because she views you as akin to her children.  She fusses you like a child because she views you as another child.  Is that ok with you?  When your wife thinks about sex, you think she imagines the guy that does chores well?  The puts up with a good ""fussing"" from her?  Christ man, sack up.  Forget about amused mastery and all that shit for a bit.  At the most basic level, aren't you the man of the house?

In regard to your questions, first two are shit tests (clean up after yourself, though, but I would definitely draw some boundaries, don't let anyone talk to you that way) and the third scenario is you asking permission before you initiate sex, so she can reject you without getting your feelz/ego hurt.  Don't ask, just do it.   How would you react to scolding like this?   I'd lay the fucking law down.

If she thought you needed sex every single day to avoid you fucking another woman, you would be getting sex every single day.  Now, Mr scientist. I propose an experiment where you have sex with your WIFE every single day for a full year. Each and every single time you're turned down for sex. Record it in a log, leave the house, and go lift weights in a gym for 1 hour. (If you have an hour for sex, you have an hour for working out). Record the progress on your lifts on the same chart.  Hypothosis. Eventually you will reach an equilibrium because you will spend so much more time fucking your wife, that you won't have time to lift to continue making gains."

Depends on the tone. Is it an order or is it a nice request? If its an order its a shit test and you could reply back with ""Orange Juice? Ill run down the street and get it fresh squeezed for you!"" With a big smile and a wink, then sit down and enjoy your meal.  Scenario 2: Typical drunk captain. She doesn't trust you or your leadership. There is a post about 93% ground beef. You should read this. You do all this shit around the house but cant even imagine to clean up coffee grounds. What a loser. She doesn't respect you. Whether its your super beta attitude or your perceived low SMV I dont know. Only you now. You just are going to have to pass shit tests, comfort tests, and read no more mr nice guy.   Scenario 3: Oh boy. Where to start. So you are a beta bux providing husband and at the end of a long day of serving her, you think you should get some sweet sweet loving. Well at 1.5 times per week we can see where that has gotten you. She trickles the sex to keep that beta bux open and giving. If you arent fucking 5 times a week, then you have something wrong. If she doesnt enthusiastically swallow your cum from a blow job, then I have some bad news for you. You have to become the leader in your house and you have to lift. Your smv has to improve to where she is attracted to you without you ever discussing it. Everything you said that she says are all shit tests. ""Im tired thats not happening!"". Shit test is easily countered with dont worry You will sleep like a rock when I done with you. As you employ kino and game right before bed time. Im tired excuse is only a shit test against sex. Believe me. That was my life for 8+ fucking years. Now when she doesn't have my cock in her mouth she feels like something is wrong and starts trying to figure it out. You need to start your game and kino about 1 hour before bed time. Push through the im tired tests with different Amused Masteries or Agree and Amplifies. Sex is a given, and she will learn that and come to enjoy it. Now once she has given up that pussy for all the sweat and shame you are going to generate. You cant go and fuck it all up with some beta sex. Fuck foreplay. You would be surprised how much foreplay she doesn't need. Once you get to the point that you passed all the shit tests and some action is about to go down, follow my little screen play.  Grab her by the hips and pull her firmly against your body. Slow move your hands up from her hips to her upper back and pull her in for a passionate tongue kiss. Grab a fistful (not a few hairs) and direct the kiss the way you want it. Be forceful and slightly dominant in this kiss. Its not a kiss she gives you, its a kiss you took. She will like that. Kiss only long enough that she wants more and then pull away and maybe not literally but put her ass on the bed. If you have been lifting enough you should pick her up and drop her about six inches off the mattress. Smile and laughs will ensue. She will wonder where the hell that man has been. She is already generating tingles and her pussy is wet. Now roughly put her into doggy style. Grab her hips, flip her over onto her stomach and pull her into doggy style. Fuck her raw and hard. If you break your pelvis you are doing it right. After you cum, and I mean immediately after your cock exits her, slap her lightly (or harder as the case may be) on her ass and tell her good girl. Then get up and go get cleaned the way you normally do.   Maybe you dont get that far. Ok. When she turns you down, get dressed up really nice, cologne, the whole nine yards and leave the house. Doesnt matter where you go, even to just sit in your car in a parking lot of a bar playing games is fine. Point is you leave. Dont answer texts, dont answer calls. When she asks as you walk out the door, tell her ""Im going out"" and leave it at that. Prepare for the shit tests and nagging, but remain in your frame and pass the shit tests. She will respect that, oddly enough."

If we're both sitting on the couch and she asks me to go get her a drink of water when she can do it every bit as easily as I can, that's a shit test that needs to be knocked down.  However, if I'm already up getting a drink of water and she asks me to bring her one too, fine, I'm already getting one.  Scenario 2: Sounds like poor captaining on your part for some of it.  Why the fuck are you leaving coffee grounds around the sink and clogging up the drain and not fixing it??  The kids clothes on the floor, not sure why she'd be mad at you for this?

You might feel guilty ""taking advantage"" of her abandonment anxiety to affect change in her, but even in the psychological literature it's well documented that genuine threats of leaving are pretty much the only way to get consistent results. Borderlines are like AWALT on overdrive. You need to turn dread game in to reality game. You need to make it unequivocally clear to her that you are prepared to leave her if things don't improve.   Also, never argue with her when she's in BPD meltdown mode. Just grab your wallet and keys, and walk out the door without saying a word. Come back hours later with a cheerful bounce in your step like nothing happened.   I'll write more when I get home and off mobile.   Edit: also note that almost all BPD literature will recommend just leaving a borderline. You can't fix her and she will eventually destroy you. But if course, most people don't follow that advice, and I doubt you will either.

Maybe not full blown,  but enough. She's been like this for years, I'm just glad I now have a name for it.   She exhibits many traits, and months ago when I kicked up my self improvement red-pill style she went nuts with suspicions.    At some point one has to realize that holding frame and being a captain (been there done that) may not be enough, or the effort to do so just isn't worth the ROI anymore.  BPD is too far gone for that.    I'm also contemplating leaving.  We only have a pair of twin girls who are close to turning 18 and starting off for university. They are very very close to their mum and it would not be as traumatic to them for me to not be around the house anymore. They agree that she starts nearly all the arguments with me, but she treats them like princesses. The college funds are good.   Advice anyone?"

You should probably go ahead and talk to a lawyer, but I wouldn't throw that in her face. But you need to develop emotional independence, and a measurable, observable frame that your happiness matters to you and that you won't tolerate continued abuse, and that you will leave her if she continues to demonstrate an inability to correct her behavior. Mostly you need to convince yourself of this first and foremost. Most men who end up in long term relationships with borderlines have some degree of codependency, and probably had mothers on the borderline spectrum.   I highly recommend seeing a therapist yourself, not only for any codependency you might have, but also to have a safe space and a sympathetic ear that you can talk about what's going on in your relationship. Find one who's experienced in counseling men recovering and dealing with abusive women. Search YouTube for a video called ""how to find a red pill therapist"", it's a great video. Also, talking about what happens in your relationship with a therapist can be a great way to deal with any possible future legal dealings involving your wife. Ie, if she ever accuses you of abuse or if you do end up getting divorced, the therapist will be invaluable in helping you defend your side of the story.   Another thing would be to keep a secret journal. It's both therapeutic and a great legal defense. Document every argument, tantrum, sexual denial, sexual access (most courts will consider having sex a form of reconciliation, so they won't be so harsh holding something against you if you had sex at some point after). Bring your journal with you to your therapist as a set of talking points, etc. It might sound wimpy or whatever to keep a journal and see a therapist, but trust me, it's vital to your mental health, and there's no shame in it.    What if the meltdown occurs very late at night? Are there legal ramifications (spousal abandonment?) by driving off for a few hours after 10 or 11pm and coming back at 2 or 3am?     Obligatory ""I am not a lawyer"" disclaimer, but I highly doubt you can be charged with spousal abandonment for leaving the house for a few hours. Spousal abandonment is when you move out or run away long term, especially if you cut her off from financial support. But again, talk to a lawyer, know your options and rights, even if you don't divorce her, at least be prepared mentally for what you might expect if you do. And if you do decide to divorce, be ruthless, because she will.   Edit: as a side point, don't trust your computer or smart phone, borderlines can be extremely paranoid and controlling, especially when you start implementing red pill changes. My wife not only had spyware on my phone, but she also recruited my best friend (a two-faced, sniveling, desperate, narcissistic, white knight gamma male) to report on my activities when out with friends and to help her spy on me. All the while she was cheating on me with not only him, but several other men. The projection is strong."

marriedredpill,3dxtez,jessalon,5,Mon Jul 20 12:32:15 2015 UTC,"I used to be unimaginably BP. About a month after I got married, my wife quit fucking me. I suffered in silence over it for years. I went online to ask for help. What was I doing wrong? Why wouldn't my wife have sex with me?  That's when I got a taste of the vitriol BP circles are capable of. No practical advice. No sympathy. Just childish, directionless rage and a stream of insults. Something like ""Fuck you! You aren't entitled to sex. You aren't entitled to anyone else's body. Fuck off you misogynist asshole!"".   I asked why she deserved my support if she didn't care about my needs, and got similar useless vitriol.  That response, over a post from a depressed man, asking politely why his wife wouldn't have sex with him, and if this was normal. It was completely bewildering, and not useful at all.  Later I found MRP philosophy, which attempted to answer why my marriage was sexless garbage, and more importantly, gave me an unambiguous plan of action.  I think practicality is the biggest draw to MRP philosophy. BP can't compete with it, because BP is inherently defeatist. If you have a problem in marriage, MRP tries to explain what the problem is and show you how to correct it. BP tells you to shut the fuck up and accept a life of misery, and that anything else is spousal abuse."

Like that Carlin line... think of the average guy, and remember that half the people are stupider than him... I get what your post was about, but really think the point is elsewhere. when you say 'offering friendship' the new RP question for that IMHO is, why? Why are you offering people these friendships (not you specifically, rhetorical question) your wife is goingto go nuclear over your changes, no reason to expect almost perfect strangers to behave better than that. Can't hold it against em either, they don't know any better. I have made slipups romantically on OI, but in general population, I've always had a strong one. Hippie douche? Yeah, I put on my half sleeve when I circumnavigated the globe and went pirate hunting outside somalia... what have you done there grandpa? I keep that thought in my head, and your situation would make me laugh.   Either way, back to your specific post  you're thinking about other people too much.

He wanders around the building at odd hours when there is hardly anyone there. Working late and have him suddenly standing in your office door is just creepy.  Knowing him for years I first laughed it off. I am thinking he is harmless. But thinking about it, it is creepy so I changed his acces rights on the biometrics so that he cannot walk into our dep. I did not even think twice about it, because I was not seeking his approval or acceptance. I was OI.  When he asked about it I just shrugged my shoulders, looked him straight in the eye and asked him why he wants access.

Don't choreplay some weak list of who does what. Not only is that lame, its not very in control either.   As you do more and more around the house, and she sees that you arent bitching or creating covert contracts. The shit tests will follow because she is hoping that this is the new you.

Instead pick up more of your fair share and don't talk about it, hint about it, or complain about it. Just do the things because they need done.

You can divide things up on the fly if you feel it's important.  One thing I do that seems to work well is finding out which chores she hates the most and doing those before she can. I don't call attention to it, I don't expect anything from it. BUT...I notice that extra things get taken care of by her when her least favorite chores are already out of the way.  She HATES cleaning the bathrooms. So I do it, and she probably works twice as long as I do on other little tasks.   Also, the assumption is always that BIG projects will be planned out by me. The last time I handled something that she said she would take care of she actually said ""just think of all the husband points you're getting"".

She does the chores, you reward good behavior in response. The cause is the chores, the effect the reward, not the other way around, nor together."

I have my man cave, and she handles the house. I like it like that cause I don't want the head ache. We are cosigned on the loan, so it is technically ours. This is my home, yes, and it is hers also. I'll protect it, but I turn it over to her for general care.   This is beta thinking   You can label it whatever you see fit. But Pavlov was right. I do something I like to do (show affection) when she does something I don't like to do (god damn chores). The conditioning of attention and affection when she does something she knows I don't like to do reinforces that the more she does that thing (chores), I give her what she wants(affection). It is a win-win in my book."
marriedredpill,3dwlgw,Diabolo_Advocato,2,Mon Jul 20 14:23:09 2015 UTC,"You assume I want the responsibility of it. I don't.    This is known as ""the drunk captain"" in MRP. You are the captain, you are the leader, you are responsible no matter what. It just happens you have good leadership, and delegate to her the management of the house. Many call this the First Office job, and in many boats, the First Officer is the one that really runs things on the day to day. But they still report to the captain.  Your home is your ship.  She isn't letting you be a passenger of her cruiseship. You are the captain, it is yours. You are responsible even when you say you don't want to be. Men can't escape this responsibility.    I have my job, and she has hers.   This is the equality society teaches us, where a home has two heads, and communication makes it work. This is what women use to take control, and although they think they want this, in the end, they resent this.   I have my man cave, and she handles the house.    This is a really terrible thing to establish. It is like this is your moms house, and she allows you have your friends to play videogames in the basement. A man's house is his castle, the whole space. You must walk to demonstrate it is all yours.  A man can't be sent to ""his room"". This is your house, and you are the leader. She is the one should feel privileged to live in your castle, under your protection.   But Pavlov was right.   All I'm clarifying is to make the cause/effect clearly and correctly organized in time. This makes all the different between covert contract and pavlovian reinforcement. Covert contract: you do something nice hoping she notices and does something for you. This is beta. Reinforcement: she does something, you do something nice to show approval. This is alpha."

As a for instance, me and my wife spent the entire weekend together and we went out with old friends we stopped trying to go out with years go. As the master would say, the supreme victory is achieved by not fighting.  For instance like:   Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.   Made pizza on a grill, failure is not an option. She has seen me fail three times in a row with pizza. She is prepared for the ultimate thrown down ""Slamma in Alabama"" steel cage no holds barred. Only this time I did some research, bought a pizza stone, and watched some videos. You should have seen the look on her face when I pulled out a perfectly cooked pizza on the grill.

It's amazing to see how they appreciate the truth.  If you have a harsh truth, you DO need to deliver it properly.  Maybe she's not pulling her weight, tell her ... politely.  Pro-tip:  When it comes to buying nice clothes, check out eBay.  Plug in your size and see what you can find.  I have dramatically improved the quality of my wardrobe by purchasing dress shirts that way.  Shirts that cost $200 - $300 new will regularly sell for $20 - $50 used, and they are in perfect condition.  You can find some really nice stuff that most guys can't afford to buy, and it helps you socially and at work (should you need to dress nice in an office, for example)."

Now imagine being a woman, planning your wedding day since you were 6, taking about it with girlfriend, etc.  The social pressures are enormous.  Not getting married isn't even in their mindset.

marriedredpill,3duoe0,wantonton,4,Sun Jul 19 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"There are several issues here.   First, is your lingering nice guy-ness.    Throughout this encounter, I DID NOT act butthurt tried to keep it light, with no accusations. I was wondering it, but never said anything. She on the other hand, was saying all sorts of things.    Not acting butthurt is always a priority. However, knowing that she did something wrong or investigating whether or not she (knowingly) did something wrong so that it can be properly addressed is not being butt-hurt. It is mandatory. Of course you want to be calm and in control. You want to listen and discuss. You want to address it appropriately. If at the conclusion you determine she deserves the benefit of the doubt, no problem.   However, you were afraid of A) being wrong, and B) (the more important issue) ""not trusting her."" Western men have been conditioned to accept the female imperative which includes not calling out women on their (potentially) bad behavior and never confronting them on their behavior and never stating out right they might be wrong/bad. It's what is required to be a Nice Guy.   In situations like this sit her down and have her discuss with you what happened and what she knows/remembers. It's OK to explain why: ""We discussed our plans and it appears you might have made changes without telling me; I'd like to understand why."" Since this is all knew to her/you she'll draw a line and try to make you call/insinuate that she'd do something bad in expectation that you will be a Nice Guy and back off. Don't. Push the issue. You don't have to say she did anything wrong but continue to investigate and allow it to be clear you don't put such behavior beyond her and that such behavior has to be addressed.   Second, as for what she recalls, that seems strange. There is a huge difference between having blood drawn and having an injection. Either way, she'd know. She should also have recalled if they'd had her take something orally.  This doesn't mean she'd necessarily remember what was injected or what pill she took, or why she received/took it.   What I guess is going on here, is she simply isn't 100% sure and is perhaps afraid she made a mistake given the plan you two created. Perhaps then, but certainly seems like now, she's too afraid to honestly admit she could be in error. It might help to understand (and you know your wife better than I do as to the accuracy of the rest of this paragraph) if she defers to authority, she may have just deferred to the advice of the medical staff without much though about how it crosses your authority.      These are the issues you need to firmly but gently tease out and address. If she intentionally undermined the plan, there has to be serious consequences. If she willfully/carelessly failed to follow the plan, there must be consequences. If she was unaware of the potential altering of the plan through her actions work with her to prevent repeats in the future. If she simply made a mistake, work with her so she understands how to fix them, including coming to you for help/awareness (she needs to understand that no matter how the error came about refusal to notify you timely about it, as opposed to hoping it goes away, makes everything worse). If there was no error at all, reaffirm for her how lucky you are to be with someone so trustworthy and who understands why communicating with you about this is so important."
marriedredpill,3duoe0,wantonton,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:07 2015 UTC,I did that after the boy went to sleep. I was afraid that if I had the conversation right there that I would lose frame. It didn't feel like the right time for me. I had to get my Frame under control before a conversation like that.

It might be possible she can't get pregnant anymore.  This is madness.  This is directed at you.  No wonder your wife is defensive.  You fucked her bareback and she got pregnant.

marriedredpill,3duoe0,enfier,5,Mon Jul 20 13:25:53 2015 UTC,"Women get their PROGESTERONE tested on cycle day (CD) 21 to see if they ovulated that cycle.  They will do that as part of any fertility treatment or testing.   To give her the benefit of the doubt, if she was worried that she couldnt get pregnant, it could be done as a test just to see if she was ovulating.  If dated May 27, if that was CD 21, then she may have ovulated on CD 15 +/- 4 days.  Putting conception date at May 21 (May 17 - May 25).  Any sperm in her would have been viable for a week, which means the load that got her knocked up was deposited on May 10 - May 26.  Your ""7 weeks"" (today) lines up with that ovulation date (they start counting from her last menstrual period (LMP)).  My read: she was trying to get pregnant, and she just wanted to see if she ovulated.  No guarantees on who's sperm was used.  Regardless, get a paternity test.  For your other question: she can also be prescribed injectables by a physician, and then inject them herself."
marriedredpill,3duoe0,bogeyd6,4,Sun Jul 19 20:01:08 2015 UTC,"If she was having irregular periods, progesterone is sometimes prescribed to bring on periods. I know they come in pill form but I don't know if they are also injected. It would be reasonable to be tested for progesterone."
marriedredpill,3duoe0,RPAlternate42,0,Sun Jul 19 17:56:34 2015 UTC,Both ideas make sense. But if she was taking Progesterone I would have known (she hates taking pills and would have bitched non stop).  Ultimately her waffling and trying to subject change like she did set my hampster in motion. Because that is her default for getting caught doing something she shouldn't.
marriedredpill,3duoe0,RPAlternate42,3,Sun Jul 19 18:03:01 2015 UTC,OK let's do a timeline.  8 weeks ago - your wife goes to the doctor and gets tested or treated (normal for her symptoms) 7 weeks ago - your wife ovulates and gets pregnant 5 weeks ago - your wife misses her period 4? weeks ago - you start having discussions about getting pregnant 2 weeks ago - your wife tells you she is pregnant

marriedredpill,3duoe0,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:35 2015 UTC,"US labs do not do injections. They only do drawls. If you had an injection it would be performed by the doctors office or the hospital. The bill would be from the doctor as the lab cannot order progesterone treatments and even then it is normally done as a shot at home. Now to set your mind even more at ease, you dont just do a progesterone shot as part of fertility treatment.   You take Clomifene citrate  to increase levels of hormones that make you ovulate. Gonadotrophins are used to increase the likely hood of producing eggs. Bromocriptine is used to stop ovulation. If your wife was ""slyly"" getting pregnant there is a whole set of other drugs that are necessary.  She was probably worried that you wanted another child and she didnt know if she was able to. She goes to the doctor and gets some lab work ordered and gets checked out. Now the lab test performed is also a test for pregnancy. The trimester stages can be judged based on the levels in the body.   Edit: In the bad old days, my wife and I did so many different fertility treatments it would make your mind spin and your wallet cry."
marriedredpill,3duoe0,thisisme0007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:04:56 2015 UTC,"Injectable progesterone, like the pill is a BC.  It's hormone in oil suspension injected into the muscle... Usually the butt, and is effective for 12 weeks.  Give me a timeline.  She got pregnant when? the lab work was done when? the injection was done when?  Without a timeline it's hard to figure out what's going on here.  I have theories but I need a timeline."
marriedredpill,3duoe0,RPAlternate42,0,Sun Jul 19 18:18:27 2015 UTC,"First off, I don't know if there was an injection, or medication administered.   Lab date was 27May. If my math is correct she got pregnant less than a week later."
marriedredpill,3duoe0,jacktenofhearts,3,Sun Jul 19 18:30:45 2015 UTC,"If she got pregnant after:  It is likely she was drawn to check levels given that the line items were ""drawing fee"" and ""progesterone.""  Having talked about it she probably wanted to make sure she was ready.  Injections would actually prevent pregnancy.  Smaller daily dosages restore periods and stop abnormal bleeding.  However, her nervousness and need to leave the conversation, of course, throws red flags.  My concern now isn't the tests so much as the timing of things as it concerns your presence with her and the validity of the pregnancy length so far.  You said it was 5 weeks.  Is this information you came by or information she gave you?  Because she can lie about 2 weeks either way and still be medically correct and those 2 weeks maybe a time you were not around.  I'm not saying your wife is a dependaslut, but AWALT.  You read it in here, TRP, and you know the outcomes.    Confirm the conception date.  Her nervousness is alarming."

Additionally, when I've tried to keep a ""public"" journal, even anonymously, I just end up writing different things. I'm not nearly as deep with any introspection. I wonder what an ""audience"" would think. Or I get too focused on public feedback more than progressing on my objectives.   My advice to you would be to keep a private journal.

Ehebedingte Nachteile können vorliegen, wenn es aufgrund der Lebensgestaltung des wirtschaftlich schwächeren Partners während der Ehe zu uneinholbaren Gehaltseinbußen gekommen ist.

You have taught her that sex is not important in a relationship via your ongoing actions and continued commitment in the face of her physical withdrawal.  Real world results tend to speak louder than words. So all your talks with her are pushing back on the much stronger message reality is giving her. She gets her ""relationship cookie"" of love and affection dispensed by you all the time, despite you never getting the ""sexaul cookie"" you seek. So she naturally assumes there is no real link between those two.  Society's message to LL partners of ""it is just sex"" and ""everyone slows down in a relationship"" only serves to make her position feel both normal and somehow more refined.  Don't try to fight all that now, with words. Instead, spend the next 6 months reclaiming yourself as an independent person, who has options in life. During that time, do not think of her as a sexual person. This should not be all that hard, depending on how dead the bedroom is.  Just focus on looking at her the way she looks at you. She is a roommate and person with whom you had a love affair in the past. But now you are sharing expenses and enjoying each other's company in a primarily social, platonic way.  Make that effort to fight back against your brain seeing her as a dispensary of sexual cookies. Fight against your trained response to hit that bar so many times, hoping for the cookie to drop! At some point---some say it comes like a CRACK!, other say it is a process over time---you will see her not as your source of sexual pleasure. You will see her as a woman who lives with you. You will see her like she sees you.  Then, once your head is cleared of your current conditioned response of being a Pavlovian-worked-over chimp desperately hitting the pellet bar for the occasional sexual cookie, you can decide whether to stay, go, fix, outsource, or whatever.  Realize that your women is not and should not be your (only) source for happiness. Her is a ten step recipe to being happy, by Alejandro Jodorowsky:   When in doubt between ""doing"" and ""not doing,"" choose ""doing"". If you're wrong at least you'll have the experience. Listen to your intuition more than your reason. Words forge reality but they are not it. Make some childish dream of yours come true. For example, if you wanted to play but were forced to become an adult before your time, save some 500 euros and go play them at a casino until you lose it. If you win, keep playing. If you keep winning, even if it's millions, continue until you lose it all. It's not about winning, but about playing with no end. There is no greater relief than to start becoming what one is. Since childhood, we're coerced into other people's destinies. We are not in this world to pursue the dreams of our parents, but our own. If you're a singer and not an attorney like your father, abandon your law career and record your album. Stop criticizing your body right now. Accept it as it is without concerning yourself with the stares of others. You're not loved because you're beautiful. You're beautiful because you're loved. Once a week, teach others the little or lot that you know. What you give to them, you give to yourself. What you don't give to them, you take away from yourself. Every day, look for a positive story in the newspaper. It's difficult to find one. But, amid all the atrocities, somehow, there always is one. A new species of bird was discovered; comets transport life; a boy who fell from the top of a five story building landed unharmed; the daughter of a president intent on drowning herself was saved by a laborer with whom she fell in love and married; young Chilean poets bombarded the palace of La Moneda where Allende was assassinated with 300,000 poems from a helicopter; etc. If your parents abused you when you were a child, calmly confront them in a neutral place that is not their territory, developing four aspects: This is what they did to me. This is what I felt. This is what, because of that, I now suffer. And this is the reparation that I ask. Forgiveness without reparation has no use. Even if you have a large family, assign yourself a personal territory where no one may enter without your permission. Stop defining yourself: allow yourself every possibility that could be, and change paths as often as necessary.   Failing does not exist. With each failure, we change paths. To arrive at what you are, you must go through what you are not. The greatest happiness is to become what you are. In every sickness there is: A prohibition: You are prohibited from being what you are. A lack of consciousness: When you don't realize what you are. A lack of beauty: When you lose beauty, you become ill.   Good luck, ShuffleUp. I wish you the best on your journey."

marriedredpill,3dqexa,RBuddDwyer,3,Mon Jul 20 15:03:57 2015 UTC,"Positive reinforcement.  When you see her respond to one of your ""suggestions"", verbally praise her for her femininity and reward her with ""sex"" - context-dependent demonstrations of attention designed to flatter and inflate her self-esteem and sense of order.  This could be something as simple as making her a cup of tea and backing her into the wall for a 10sec kiss, or something as elaborate as a lunch date at someplace nice and public.    Failing to give positive reinforcement risks keeping the hamster spinning in the wrong direction.  Bonus points for adding a similar direction in another aspect of her life, say appearance.  If you have a preference for dress or hairstyle, simply express it immediately after positive reinforcement, shut up, and see how she responds.  Well-played.  Keep your frame."

marriedredpill,3dqexa,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:34:57 2015 UTC,"Lighter weights for more reps, combined with using your energy to target specific muscles that show more means more visible and defined muscles. That is bodybuilding. Less reps with more weight, spread out over more muscles means more strength, but less visible definition. That is powerlifting. You can try to balance one or the other, but generally you can only focus on one.  In short, targeted lifts mean more visible muscles, while combination lifts me an more overall strength."
marriedredpill,3dqexa,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats hypertrophy, thanks. But I cant see why compound lifts are ""absolute shit for aesthetics"" if you do them in high reps and I cant see why compounds are solely limited to powerlifting.   Not to begin with that building base strenght with lower rep and complementing them with high reps should be much more efficient for building more muscle and more definition.  Please clearify."
marriedredpill,3dqexa,Fucty_Artsy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:17:31 2015 UTC,"I think it is more about spending your limited energy on targeting specific muscles that will make you look bigger, as opposed to just being stronger. I don't know a lot about lifting, so I cannot give you specific examples. I only do bodyweight. But read up on powerlifting vs. bodybuilding. That will have more answers for you."
marriedredpill,3dqexa,stonepimpletilists,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, theres a great youtube video by a bodybuilder on that. Can't remember his name though.  The gist wasn't about the compound lifts, it's about lifting your ego, instead of your muscles. he was curling very light weight compared to his student, but he had full range of motion, full muscle engagement, and it was far more valuable than a larger weight, cheating, and that pump feeling, which is just blood moving around, not any type of growth.  If time is your concern, compounds can save your life, deads and squats literally work every muscle in your body. benches work your entire upper chain... IT's their benefit. Muscles get better at working in groups, like they were designed, it increases testosterone responses, and prevents injury, because the stabilizing muscles are getting their proper workout.   And that last bit cannot be stressed enough. Those small muscles no one will ever see, the bones that are increasing density over time. the CNS system, creating more connections for better muscle engagement. Those are the important parts of working out that no one really talks about casually.  Which is too bad, most failure is because of your nerves shutting down, and not actual muscle fatigue. Compound lifts are what make those strong. Most injury is because stabilizing muscles cannot handle the weight that your big muscles are driving (isolation exercies and large assisted weight) which is why lifting raw is a good thing. the bone density is the reason your frame is even able to handle that much without joint problems...  Granted, you're right. you focus on certain muscles, they will get bigger than the ones you don't work. but thats 'fake it till you make it' you won't be as big as quickly (more work than you need), you won't get the fat burn of intensity, you won't get the stabliizers to prevent injury, the stronger frame to hold the muscle, or the CNS engagement to allow you to fully utilize your entire muscle on every workout.  If you just want to 'look bigger' why bother fucking around, go learn how to do a cycle of D-bol or someting. it's usually married guys in their 30s that are the primary users anyways"

Muscles do 2 things, grow, or shrink... thats it.  Testosterone and repair makes them grow. the heavy compounds give a huge T boost to your system, thats they squats are the best bicep workout around.  The isolation exercises are there to add the cherry on top. That extra bit of cannonball on your arms, the sleightly larger barrel chest. the marginally bigger traps and back V. The touch more size on your shoulders...  If you want aesthetics? lose weight. even most powerlifters have a bit of a shit locker made of fat, for the stability of their core. OP is more than able to stop doing heavy compound lifts once he gets to the point where he isn't able to lift raw past a certain point.  Probably better anyways, lifting raw is the best way to ensure injury free working out for the long term."

Most olymic atheletes with the aesthetic bods are perfectly proportionned, and do the big three. The issue comes when it becomes about the numbers on the plates, instead of the goal of muscle growth. Thats when the thicker trunk stability matters more than aesthetics.  I agreee you're right that the compounds are shit for aesthetics, but by the time they become an impediment, you're already far enough along to be pulling the ideals (1.5x BW bench, 3X DL, 2X squat)  actually, I'll have to get back on those, it's a very, very OLD post on musclehypertrophy forums"

Its better to do 30 reps of 25lb deadlifts for a month or so on deadlift day. The last thing you want is to injure your back because you cant really train any muscle group without it. Kettles are fine as long as your form is good.

I will also bet that you have some beta issues still. Lifting is necessary but not sufficient. If you are    too much of a pussy to call her out on her dishonesty    and you are playing aloof and attempting dread instead of being and doing, and she isn't physical with you, you're not doing it right.  You need to work on your frame, learn to recognize and pass shit tests, OI, all that stuff, or this problem will come back. And avoid oneitis in the future.  She's not the only girl out there. Sure you have feelings for her; they will pass, and you'll have feelings for the next girl, and she won't be the only one either. There is nothing special about any single girl, you can get the same or better elsewhere. Don't let your feelings make you lose sight of that. You have be willing and able to walk away if your relationship goes south. That means sucking up a few weeks of heartbreak, but fuck that, there's hardly a single person on this planet who haven't been through it. You'll live.  I know it sucks, but there's only one way forward. Lift, do stuff, get on with your life. It will pass.  Good luck."

I recognize now with painful clarity where I failed to maintain frame and to say ""no"" in the relationship. Also, my dread game was weak and I failed to create opportunities to successfully instill dread in her. The strength of hypergamy combined with my weak dread game was the death blow.    I'm trying to look on the bright side here, and I'm going into the future with eyes wide open. To even get to this point of being able to really walk away I had to wrestle with Outcome Independence but that's a tough mindset to fully adopt.   Thanks again."
marriedredpill,3dpou6,stonepimpletilists,2,Sat Jul 18 07:54:02 2015 UTC,"successfully instill dread in her.    get out of that mindset. A lot of guys seem to think dread is a strategy to get her to straighten up. It does that, but it's not the goal IMHO. The goal of dread is to get you to the point where you can basically throw a rock and find a girl who wants to fuck you... The dread is that the girl that is with you needs to be on her game, otherwise she's wasting your time.  None of it has anything to do with some cause and effect reaction from her... she literally has nothing to do with it (keep that in your mind) if you have OI, you don't think of time together as some kind of investment, that you don't want to throw away. you think of it like a sunk cost, like you invested in Enron, and you're cutting your losses and moving on.  Remember, you aren't trying to win back your wife, like a romantic comedy. you're starting to look out for #1 again (no one else will) and in no uncertain terms, showing her that she better get her shit in order, or you will move on.  What helped me, is already assuming it's over. and shes there for one purpose. To use to test your improvements, and give you the time to see if you are kicking the can down th road, or will truly be higher value for the next girl you meet.

I struggle to let my normally rational self override my emotions. I'm beginning to mourn the death of our relationship and our future, so I understand how I feel is probably healthy.   If you didn't feel horrible right now, I'd doubt your humanity.  So mourn your marriage and let the emotions wash over you from time to time.  That's part of being human.    It sounds like you've made the right decision, you're in the prime of your life with your best years about to hit.  You'll be fine in the long run.  In the short run it's going to suck.

marriedredpill,3dpou6,marxistbacon,4,Sat Jul 18 12:15:14 2015 UTC,"I could use some support right now as I am in a very dark place mentally.   I get that. Divorced too, after a decade, then found TRP.  Like others described, your emotions will be going to hell and back for the next little while.  It's great to envision being 100% stoic and composed but the reality is totally different. Just let the emotions happen, ride them out, and each time it will get a little better.   what I'm looking for from you guys is confirmation that I did the right thing.    No way I can tell you that - no way for me to know if it's true or not.  But what I can tell you is that, no matter what you feel now, you have a whole life ahead of you to make things better than they ever were.  They say time heals all wounds - not true unless you are willing to adopt the mindset and belief that things will be actually be better. You have that mindset now. Don't spend too long wallowing in self-pity and angst over this. Grieve the end of your relationship but once it's done learn from it and move on to bigger and better things in your life.  Based on what you described about your goals versus her goals (I liked /u/jacktenofhearts ""pixie dream girls"" characterization), it sounds like the right call.  Being in charge of your own life and ""manning up"" means that sometimes you have to make those hard calls, to recognize that setting yourself up for a lifelong conflict of interest and vision would have made your life miserable for decades.  As nice as it is to keep thinking ""what if this works out somehow"", ""what if she changes"", ""what if..."", you can't live in what-if land.  You're constantly off-balance, chasing something ephemeral, living at her whim. Learn from the past but live in the reality of the now.  After time and hindsight over my own experience, I can honestly say I'm glad I got divorced. It opened so many doors, unloaded a toxic person from my life, and gave me the chance to experience how much better my life could be. By having standards and experience I was able to judge character more accurately and find a much, much better woman.  Just wait, work on yourself, and you'll see happen too. ""This too shall pass.""

It is more helpful than you know to be able to bounce my situation off of guys who have been in a similar position.   I've enabled her selfish behavior, and that's a tough pill to swallow. She's so used to being able to ""live for today"" and stubbornly decide what makes her happy that at this point I realized that I had no viable way of inspiring her to actually sacrifice something for once in our relationship. I had to work myself up over many months to man up and pull the trigger on this, and I know rationally that long term it is the right move. Living in the immediate aftermath of leaving her is hell though, but I understand you can relate to that and I'm not looking for more pity. I made this bed so now I'm sleeping in it.

As a matter of personal taste, your wife sounds completely unbearable to me. I've met a lot of these ""manic pixie dream girls,"" who all basically demonstrate the pinnacle of solipsism. Everything is about ""living for today"" and ""we only have one life on this planet."" It's basically a completely hedonistic mindset. The idea of making even the slightlest sacrifice for someone else is completely foreign to them.  So I'm not surprised to hear that prescriptive Red Pill basically fell flat. Dread is ultimately the opposite of being taken for granted, but your wife probably hates the idea that she can't take things for granted, and there's a cost to traveling the world on a shoestring budget. She probably imagines herself as a wizened women in her 50s and 60s, with a long list of travel experiences and lovers that she looks fondly upon. Well, great. But there's a cost to that kind of life. If that makes you an ""asshole"" for reminding her of as much, so be it.   Get used to saying, ""we've been together since we were teenagers and we're just different people now. She wants to keep traveling as a penniless backpacker, I want to do other things. Not much sense in trying to make the marriage work on those terms."" Address it and move on. People will cluck sympathetically and then let you change the subject.   The only other advice is I think you should call her out on her dishonesty. You will spend way too much time in the anger stage otherwise. You'll keep imagining these fantasy confrontations where you rightly called her out on her bullshit and reduced her to a puddle of tears. But even worse, you'll allow yourself to image her being so devastated that she begs for you not to leave her. Confront her, and there's no fantasy left, just reality. She'll probably hamster all these justifications for her actions, try to spin things as your fault, and you'll probably just feel a sense of disgust afterwards. That's good. You know who she is. No point in imagining things could have turned out otherwise."

I'm even all about having adventures, I've been with her to Africa, South America, and Asia...but I'm not a wandering hippy or aspiring digital nomad.   I really appreciate your wisdom here.

You wanting to start a family and her wanting to be a PA are not mutually exclusive.  Actually she can absolutely start her process while she's pregnant.  If you do it right, she can have her baby between semesters.  If I were you I'd draw up a detailed agreement.    The agreement should center on what her duties are towards the home front while going through school.  The schooling for PA is not that big of a deal.  She's looking at a 20 hour a week commitment including studying and precepting.  As far as a surgical PA, I would make it part of the agreement that she first work for a year to partially repay you for her schooling.  This is a form of collateral for your effort and money.    I'm not a feminist.  I believe in traditional rp gender roles, but I'm also not willing to stay at home with kids 10 hours a day so I don't expect any other person to have to do it either.  I also believe in the power of the individual.  Whether it be an employee or my wife or my kids, I always push them to find the best version of themselves.    Before you start with more rhetoric, my wife has a masters degree in nursing is a certified NP, CRNA, and PA.  Want to guess who paid for the schooling?  It sure as shit wasn't her family.  I'm speaking from experience.  Did I have to manage her?  Absolutely.  The house would start dragging, and I'd have to sit her down and lay it out for her.  It was certainly worth it.    Part of your role as leader is to build up those around you.  I've given my wife the tools to live without me.  That's part of what being ""Alpha"" is all about.  Having the confidence that no matter how much her station in life is raised she still sees your value.  It's illustrated daily.  Every morning when she puts that stethoscope on, guess who made that possible?   You really want to be the guy that made it impossible?  You think that leads to a happy marriage?  You think she's not going to resent you?"

I agree with Athol Kay in that homemaker is not a career and have told my wife as much. I'm content with her making crafts and working in esthetics occasionally (she's graduated hair school but no license since we moved out of state rather quickly after), and I would be ecstatic if she suggested going to school.  Considering our current situation, though, (baby on the way and loads of my own student debt) we'd have to analyze if we can afford it and I would lay down strict rules on her continued responsibilities and the things I would be able to pick up doing.  My guess is your wife feels unfulfilled currently and without knowing more what she does now, it sounds like you were a complete jackass to her suggestion. You should have sat down and discussed all the factors that would be involved in taking a decision and evaluating if it's reasonable for her to do so at all and if so what things she would have to keep doing at home.   Maybe she could do part time schooling until she can actually take a job. Maybe you can't afford the crippling tuition fees. Maybe you have three screaming children she simply wants some relief from and you've put her off so much that this is her chance at reprieve.

Had she approached me attesting to a love of science or service perhaps I would have afforded her more respect. But she did nothing of the sort and just carried on like a rebellious little brat. I'm all for self-actualization but I don't think women possess that sort of introspective drive. All I heard squeaking out of her little mouth is ""i feel a lot of things that I don't understand and I'm going to do something really big and naughty so that I can hurl my feelings at you.""  A PA is hop away from the prestige of a physician. The medical model of training as a diagnostician is serious fucking business. Particularly surgery. I don't think a tsunami of girl feels is a reasonable catalyst for embarking on such a massive change.  I work upwards of 60 hrs a week in a very fast paced industry. I rely on my wife to keep the homestead tacked down and additionally I need her running errands and doing misc. administrative tasks to keep my game as efficient as possible. I will not bust my ass like a maniac and then come home and handle all the domestic responsibilities too. This is not what I signed up for.   Unfortunately she can't do part time school as she already has her bachelors degree and would have to jump directly into a full time graduate program and PA school from what I've researched is more intense than medical school because they cram two years of didactic training into one year. It's too much and she's already almost too old to have kids. If we wait until she's done with this she would be 34 and that's a deal breaker."

It's no surprise she reacted the same way and is now in fact trying to rebel against your wishes.   You need to put your pathetic ego where it belongs: away. Then address this situation explicitly and coordinate it with her.   If you truly want a couple kids with her before that biological clock runs out, you sit her down and tell her that you expect to start a family with a woman who wants to do the same. No petty comments on her plans, no discussion. If she tries to argue, reiterate ONCE then leave the room if she continues. Then go from there.  If you have other plans, figure them out then discuss it with her. You can't simply have a decision made up, not tell her, then blow up if she so much as suggests something else."
marriedredpill,3drdyr,castlecrasher2,3,Sat Jul 18 20:54:07 2015 UTC,Just to further elaborate and to keep the BP feeding frenzy at bay - I am UNEQUIVOCALLY pro women's rights. I believe that they can do and achieve any goddamn thing they so desire and I endorse that. My situation with my wife is that she was a dopey little party slut all through school who invested not one iota of concern for her future. I have no misgivings over her n=count and don't feel that makes or breaks someone's worth. I do however feel that there are certain windows for achievement and if ya haven't mustered the effort towards becoming the professional you want to be during the appropriate time period and weasel your way into someone's life under the pretense of being contented with being a support player - it's unfair to change the rules. I didn't create menopause. She knew the time frame she was up against and now at the 11th hour she freaks. It's not a very respectable position. I did everything correctly and busted my ass and happily embraced all the privation it took to achieve a good life. I don't think its unreasonable after all the slack I've cut my wife regarding her early indiscretions for me to regard her new found goals as a day late and a dollar short. I married her as a reformed party girl because she's beautiful and sweet and hilarious and I accepted her as is with the caveat that her poor discretion merited a bit of micro managing.

Perhaps I could use the promise of her going back to school as carrot for a job well done as a future mother. This is definitely not the time for her to do this. I will accept no role from her other than motherhood at this point as her eggs are quite literally rotting on the vine. We got a real finite window here for making babies. I imagine once the kids are old enough that they can have a sitter (assuming a good 5 or so years out). We could readress her calling - which I can only assume will be a moot and long forgotten point. But if she's seriously got this in her cross hairs then it will mean just as much to her in 5 or 6 years after doing something substantially more important first first aka motherhood.

Whether you pay for her school or magically she wins the lottery and pays for school herself, it doesn't seem to me like you'll get what you want.   So take the money out of the equation and tell her you want a stay at home wife. Accept the possibility that she might leave you.   Once you figure out what is important to you, NEVER compromise on it. So what if she leaves and you have to pay some alimony.

The second problem here is that they apparently haven't been talking about kids and their general, overall life trajectories.   That's on OP and Wife.

She can judge whether she feels she will have the energy to take care of kids.  If you want kids for yourself right now then say so...  don't project onto her.

If you are OK with your wife having a career and split the house duty 50 /50  then by all mean let her do what she want  BUT  If you do need your wife at home so she can take care of the house so both of you can still have some free time outside of work and house chore well you will have to put your foot down and tell her why you need her at home.  Your only card is your commitment. So yes if you put your foot down and she refuse you will have to make the tough decision.

I want all of you. I want you to be around and I like having you around.""  Butthurt shit test ensued and I fogged it and did the broken record to get my message across.

marriedredpill,3dmmxr,angels_fan,15,Fri Jul 17 14:36:42 2015 UTC,"Dude, where to begin.  My wife wasn't sexually confident until roughly 3 years ago(We have been fucking 4-7 times a week our entire marriage but it's recently become crazy, unfiltered sex). We fucked, different positions, oral, 69, etc. but there was *always some reservation.  Then I finally broke it down for her. I told her that our time on this planet is limited and that I want all of her. I told her exactly all the shit I wanted..and guess what, slowly but surely she responded.   I'm in shape and have had a solid SMV/game/dread so maybe that helped, but she is also a sexually charged chick who enjoys sex. We fuck, a lot.  She role plays, sometimes it's librarian, a stripper, the other day it was a 'country girl', fucking spanish 'escort' (My wife is white). I think she does it so she can dress up and 'be an actress' and also get fucked.   It may be a good route because it will allow her to separate herself from her 'role'. Mrs. Angels_Fan wouldn't fuck against the house in the backyard, but if she were to be filling the role of Maid, then it isn't her but rather the maid that did that.  We fuck in other locations. Sometimes mixing up the location will mix up the position. She'll blow me in the shower and shoot is all over her or catch it in her mouth and let me see it before she swallows. Bent over the couch puts her in the position where I'm pretty sure my cock hits her spine.  It doesn't get 'planned' but it 'starts' before you get to the bedroom. The other day she was sliding her foot over my crotch while we were at a restaurant, which led to a makeout session in the car(denied road head) and fucking on the kitchen table that night.  I implemented the rule that twice a day every day we'd have a 10 second kiss. Once during the day and once before sleep. If we didn't do it, then we have given up. If you recall I had an issue with my wife about a month ago, well the dread I laid led to some serious raising of her standard. We've had sex every single day for the past 30+ days except for the two days she had her heavy period and on those nights she blew me.  she sends me photos all the fucking time. Sometimes its her tits, other times her ass, today was her sucking on a pencil at fucking work. She sent me her snatch, her wearing only one of my button downs..basically she mixes it up and keeps my eyes from drifting from her.  You have to own sexuality and slowly but strategically start making it an aspect of the 'new' you. The biggest things to remember is that  A) you don't plan it with her. You plan it in your head as to what you want to do (it may not happen, no covert contracts) but basically a rough idea as to what you want to do with her and how you're going to get that.  B) You have to make her comfortable. If she's uncomfortable it isn't going to happen. Keep working on her embracing how sexual she is, let her know exactly how good she looks in that dress, skirt, whatever. Send her a text during the day telling her how you're rock hard and can't stand up at work because you were thinking of her from the other night.  I sent my wife a picture of my erection and she sent me back that she kept thinking of how she wanted it in her and then a few minutes later sent me a picture of her wet panties. text isn't my 'go to' but it has a purpose every now and again, don't rely on it.  It is possible, you just need to lead her.  EDIT   Because I just thought of it.  Play to your strengths. I'm not a well endowed Man, I'm 5' 7"" with a 6.5"" member. I'm providing this because I'm not cock diesel, but I know how to use it.   Sometimes during the beginning of sex I will play Just the Tip until she is literally begging me to fuck her and I'll wait until she is mid sentence of pleading to fucking slam it into her. It's amazing what it does to her psyche. I never focus on getting her off but rather on us feeling fucking good.  I'll lift one leg when I'm getting close so I can get even deeper and she loves it. Or some night I'll hit it from behind with her propped on a pillow and when I do that I can't fit inside her fully and that's a cool fucking feeling when she says she thinks it's going to come out her throat.  Tell her to get on top. Tell her to take control and see if she can dominate you. My wife will grab my neck, try and hold my hands back and be sexy, I'll let her for a few, then slip my hands over hers and hold her hand behind her back while I fuck her from the bottom.  Put your hand at the base of your dick and tell her to reach it with her lips or see how long she can keep the entire thing in her throat.  Take her to the garage or somewhere that isn't sexy and finger/oral her until she orgasms and just walk away while she is trembling with pleasure. My wife loves/hates that. she thinks we're going to do more or that I'll fuck her after but I just walk away and she is left in the garage gym or basement with post orgasm tremors thinking of what the fuck I just did to her.  Enjoy it brother, you know your wife so you have to cater it to her."
marriedredpill,3dmmxr,TrainingTheBrain,2,Fri Jul 17 15:00:23 2015 UTC,"Solid, man!  I like the idea of doing some role play.  We've tried in the past, but we seem to always break out of character because we ""feel dumb"".   I've always said that if I became famous, my stage name would be Adrian Escalante.  Last night we were driving home and I told her that I'm going to be Adrian one of these nights and was describing this guy, doing my best Antonio Banderas accent.  I told her she'd have to be Mrs. Escalante, and what kind of woman would marry Adrian?  She seemed pretty receptive to the idea and started talking about Mrs Escalante's traits.  The one thing I want her to do that she fucking refuses is to use toys on herself.  She's not opposed to using them, but only if I'm the one using them on her.

We've tried in the past, but we seem to always break out of character because we ""feel dumb"".   Dude, totally natural, YOU have to force yourself to stay in character. Think of it as your frame. Fully convince yourself that this chick is someone 'new'. Lay your RP game on her, treat her like the fresh pussy she is, Stay in Character.  Pleasuring herself is something that I have never really been into. It's why I would never just jerk off in front of her. Sure, I'd jerk it for like 10 seconds to finish on her, but never beginning to end so she may feel the same way.  That may be one of those things that you get once everything else falls into play.   Start Small  EDIT  Because I never say everything in my initial post. Day sex is another key milestone you need to break. Sex at night, with the lights off is fucking routine, Break. Routine. fuck during the day, fuck at night with the lights on, fuck at you parents house or like I did last weekend grab her and get her into the bathroom, close the door, makeout fucking hard for like 30 seconds then just take the fuck off. Like, seriously, grab the door and get out while she stands there with her tongue still out of her mouth.   When she rejoins you at the party or wherever you are, she'll have the sexiest grin on her face and she'll be fucking drooling for you the entire time your at the place."

Touch her like you would some random chic.k you were gaming, try a venue change, the whole PUA thing.    When you bang her later, stay in your role.  It's fun as hell.

We 'play' with each others body, we satisfy those primal needs/urges.   Let me put it this way, and this is an actual conversation from this morning.  Her: Do you know what I love?  Me: My dick in your mouth?  Her: Well, yes, and it does have to do with your cock, but not me sucking it.  Me: Go on...  Her: Even after 7 years of marriage and 12 years of dating, I am still impressed with how big and hard your dick can get. Like, it gets hard, but when you really like what I'm doing it feels like it turns to granite. When I was giving you head last night I literally thought exactly that, 'this thing feels like granite' and I fucking Love it.  Me: Wink at her, go to the kitchen to start coffee (While I'm smiling, I refuse to entertain the compliment, let her think it and let it get her wet, but I won't go down the 'I Love Me Path' as that leads to complacency)  The moral, Women LOVE sex. As long as you own it and make it a subject that is ok to talk about and freely/openly discuss, they will respond.  Clear the air, let her know that not only is it ok to be open and free but that's what you want from her.

The best thing is taking a compliment silently.  Just letting it sit there, letting those words get really heavy.  Doesn't require any bragging or fishing.  Just letting people (and wife) recognize how awesome I'm becoming - and laughing like a grinning idiot inside).  I need to do a better job leading her.  Just this morning I sent her a text regarding an out-of-town trip we're taking this weekend.  Her: can you please clue me in on what's going on this weekend?  I would like to mentally plan and prepare what I need to do to get ready (laundry, meals, etc)  Me: We're leaving in our own car Saturday morning.  The dogs will stay home.  Meet your family on the coast, have a fun relaxing time where you let me know if your family is bothering you and I take you away for a break.  Then we go to [town] and visit [my family] and [your friend].  Dinner will be with my family.  Then we'll come home, the kids will fall asleep in the car, and as I drive you'll give me a handjob and I'll finger you.  We'll collapse into each other's arms when we get home after the long, but enjoyable, day.  Her: Wow.  ..........just...........wow............ give me a minute.............  Ok, I'm still red in the face and giggling but okay.  I got it.  Me: Take your time coming off that.  Its a fun high, and we only have so much time in this life.  We gotta go for what we want.

When I was scrawny and weak, she felt ugly and insecure because she could only fuck a scrawny weak guy, now that I'm starting to get in better shape, she feels better about herself because she's fucking someone ""hot"" (at least compared to before).

I'd push for not only more sex, but opening her up sexually. getting my wife to feel confident with role play, sending me photos (of everything), talking dirty, dressing up all of that type of shit is in a woman, you need to get her to feel like she can pull it off free from judgement.  Your lady may not be into stuff like that, but that's for you to determine. If she's a freak when she drinks, she's a freak when she's sober(she just hides it).

If I don't portion healthy food for meals, she won't eat healthy.  If I show even the slightest non alpha behavior,  she loses her mind.  She is still keeping up with the housework and shit testing me often so I don't see her as checked out.   I don't recall her being such a low quality woman before our relationship slid downhill (I've always been beta).  I accept that as a man the weight of the world is on me anyhow, but I am wondering is this type of behavior likely to improve after the 1 month/year married worth of time is put in with me fixing myself?

This has helped me avoid laying my emotions on her like I used to.  I am still second-guessing my entire pre-RP life but I cannot think of a situation in the first few years where she displayed such low value.

If you have to set up a work out video for her to work out...  unless she just likes you to be involved, that might sound like criticism to her, which can be toxic over a longer timeframe.  Let me take you through a thought experiment real quick. You stated elsewhere that you/she thinks she's currently low quality. As she gets higher quality, she'll get more and more attention from other people with them saying ""I'd never hold you to any standards. That guy is fucked up for thinking you should be attractive, or helping you be attractive."" If she is used to you guiding her, that that will be some welcome talk for her.  If she is ""obeying"" or even ""following"" you, she's unacceptable to all sorts of things.  You really need her ""investing"" in you.  When she is ""investing"" in you, then she can go sky high and she'll shut down those sorts of criticisms because people saying such things are attacking her instead of you.     I plan to use dread to combat this.   It's a really fine line sometimes.  A girl needs to already be sufficiently invested for dread to work.

The weight gets heavy pretty quickly and if your form is not near perfect it will mess up your knees and hips and slow you down, especially if youre also running.

So, roughly you have 180 days to remove 122,500 calories from your diet.  Or 680 calories a day.  This is doable.  Walking 6 miles burns about 400 calories depending on frame.  Also, if you target a pound and a half a week you should hit your target.  That is also doable."

It's the best way to prime your body for fat loss. the intensity and long term fat burner out there (it's never that 45 minutes at the gym, it's the 23 hours of higher metabolism that loses weight).  The hardest kilometer is the best workout supplement. Run 100m as hard and fast as you can... walk back to the start... repeat 10 times. it's maybe 12 minutes of your life, but you'll want to die, and your body will be burning fat all damned day. And the best part? No matter how good you get at it, it's still just as hard as the first day. Add to that a little weightlifting, and you'll drop weight like it was nothing.  add a few 5k runs here and there to top up your diet (cardio is great for the burning of those few calories, diet is never perfect) and you'll notice that those weight sessions will be way more effective, as well as an easier cutting phase  IMHO."

marriedredpill,3dmeta,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:28:20 2015 UTC,"Fitness answer here, this is what you do:  Download MyFitnessPal on your iphone or android. It is a calorie and macronutrient tracker. Use a calorie calculator such as this to find the number of calories you need to eat a day to attain your goal in that 6 months. STICK TO THE KETO DIET... in my trials it is by FAR the best way to lose weight and sticking to keto makes it SO MUCH EASIER to stay under calories. Don't fuck around with ""somewhat low carbs,"" just do keto as in as close to ZERO as possible. If you need one cheat day a week on keto then go for it. I've noticed it helps a little in the gym the following week if I have a day I eat carbs but I never let the ""carb day"" push me over my calorie limit for the day. You can make macronutrient goals in MyFitnessPal that align with your ketogenic diet and so you will know every evening if you've fucked up or are really hitting your diet spot on... then results won't be an if thing but a when thing.  Stronglifts I wouldn't do on a caloric deficit. To me it's a lot of squats and your body would probably like squatting 3 times a week with a surplus so maybe save the stronglifts for when you're trying to gain weight... or just bypass stronglifts altogether. I would personally go for reverse pyramid (https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/wiki/faq - explained here). I have never tried the intermittent fasting they talk about on there because well... I don't think I'd like that kind of schedule. I have been able to drop any weight I've ever wanted on keto alone.   I'd still read WISNIFG just because even though you think you have something down completely you may read it and be like ""holy shit I do this!"""

marriedredpill,3dmeta,RedPillForever,2,Fri Jul 17 14:57:40 2015 UTC,"Well somewhat accurate on the surface if you never grow out of the SL program but there is more to it. 5x5 is a beginner program of compound lifts to build a foundation. If you have success and can complete the program you will get stronger and will have a strong foundation to move to his next recommended plan 3x3 and so on. It is a common misconception that core compound lifts like squat, presses and deadlifts will only engage one muscle group. Good form squats and deadlifts are massive core builders. I would say it is a great program to start changing your body. Once you finish you will have a great foundation and knowledge to branch out."

marriedredpill,3dmeta,GizDrak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"70s big is a similar type strength program that has more focus on the upper body.  While it's a beginner program, the PDF itself doesn't have a whole bunch of the basic form lessons you'd need if you are starting from scratch, but you can probably make do with YouTube videos.  What it makes up for that with is an excellent description of various set/rep schemes to continue improving once a basic 3x5 or 5x5 scheme stops delivering results.  I'd say that program could take you well into the intermediate stages of strength.  Starting Strength (the book) has a lot of good info on doing the big movements that's a big help for a beginner even if you aren't doing the program.  I mean the book has 56 pages on how to do a squat and 37 on the bench press.  Both books contain concepts that will be highly useful even if you are doing a different program."

Being a woman, she can easily have sex with someone that does not arouse her hypergamy (as men, we literally can't, without PDE-5 inhibitors) - this is what BB sex is like. IOW, she'll fuck someone less attractive than her arousal ""floor"", but it will only be in exchange for provisioning (or, very rarely, caregiving). Often hypergamy will, as a shortcut, refer to women's pluralistic, dual mating/sexual strategy - AF/BB. You can see how there would have to be a minimum SMV for her AF."

So at the time: If it's just heated talk  Either sex I'd step between and tell them to chill out and quickly remove my s/o.   If it's a cat fight and physical you've got to quickly break them up. It's chicks. Shouldn't be hard. unless they're 300 pound bruisers and you're a Melvin Milktoast. In which case you've got bigger issues. While the dude in this video demonstrates a lot of kicking and punching (as an example of how the sexes really aren't equal in strength), I'm a big fan of learning joint locks and manipulation in order to not go to jail myself. I'm always touting Aikido for that (Nihon goshin) or Krav Maga, or any art that teaches such. Even traditional Okinawan Karate incorporates a lot of nerve and pressure points. Again, all of this is to break it up and not get YOU in trouble. Then remove your girl from the scene.  A dude gets physical with your woman? What do you think? You can still scold her later if she caused it. And lay down how it's going to be.   Personally any time I got a hint that a girlfriend liked stirring up shit, and involving me I dropped her pretty quick.   [Edit] And really, though I never addressed it, never champion her cause if she's wrong, but don't bother trying to apologize FOR her either in the moment. Guys will generally realize once you're removing her what your take is. Nothing wrong with shooting an exasperated look as most other guys might have been in the same situation and grasp so long as they aren't total douches.

Without even really questioning it I went ahead and hid the CD in her purse, the day after she was pouting. Later that day I get happy texts from her about finding the CD. This is followed by her being in a good mood and no longer pouting.   Now my fear is that I've sent the message that I was apologizing. I most certainly was not. And I'm also concerned that I in essence rewarded bad behavior. Am I overthinking this? The pouty BS stopped but I'm wondering if I haven't made things worse in the long run."
marriedredpill,3dmeta,enfier,2,Sun Jul 19 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"It certainly could be construed as an apology. Timing did not benefit you. Stay the course and remind her of the actions you need her to take so she's not thinking that it's water under the bridge.   Next time reward good behavior on her part with such gifts. Awesome dinner and some special desert, ""oh hey babe I was thinking of you when I got this"" or maybe she gives you the $1000 whore treatment; leave it with a note saying ""to my personal hooker, I couldn't get dirtier if I paid for it"""

Now I just give fake/stupid/silly responses that show I don't care if she gets mad. Stuff like ""being kidnapped by Chinese hookers"" ""at the gay bar""...etc.   One of the hardest things to overcome, but ultimately one of the most rewarding is realizing that her getting mad at you for not complying with her demands actually turns her on and will work to your benefit in the end. It seems so backwards at first, and be prepared to smile after she calls you an asshole. If you play it right she will come crawling back to you later, usually with something sexy in mind.  Just don't get too caught up in saying no to everything. Sometimes a request is just a request because it's easier for both of you."

You can't change who you are in someone else's eyes over the course of a week. She needs to find this new you credible and you need to really start the whole transformation by working hard on YOURSELF.

If you become a better man, and in the end you find out she's a subpar layabout, then ditch her ass...  I say it all the time in here, none of this is about her. In fact, as soon as you start on this journey, she's done, and only around for you to practice what you've learned, so you don't screw up on the next girl. If she wants back into your life, she better straighten up, but thats her fight, not yours.  I know everyone in here says 'try to fix before you nuke' and I agree with that, but I find too many are finding it too easy to use that as a crutch for more BP bullshit.  Fuck it, you're done with her (you'll probably have your check-out phase with her anyways) get your shit in order for the next girl, your career etc... keep a small part of you rooting for her to pull out of the spin, but thats it. IMHO. Im most cases, girls aren't stupid, and sort their shit out, no one wants to get ditched because their husband or boyfreind thought too little of them... that hits them right in the SMV.  Also:  you don't know thats what she wants. Let me guess, she told you? The one big lesson I've learned through RP is that whatever she says, at best... at best, it's a wild guess. At worst, it's whatever combination of words she will need to use in order to get the emotional response out of you she is wanting.  Or she's just a lazy slug who aimed low. If anything, I would take that as a challenge. The only girl who wants to fuck me on the regular literally scraped the bottom of the barrel? Fuck that."
marriedredpill,3dmeta,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:13:03 2015 UTC,"I did. If you're being treated like that then divorce isn't a bad thing. Remember to act and not react. Don't get emotional and let her outbursts control your frame.   Remember that the reason you found trp is that you were unhappy. That unhappiness has driven you to where you are now. So would you rather go back to the unhappiness you used to know (searching the internet for reasons why your wife would hate you, initiating sex only to be rejected time and time again, making sure suicide is covered in your insurance policy so that at least your final act can make her happy, or whatever your personal brand of misery is)or would you rather realize that your happiness matters and you aren't put on this earth to cater to a woman who could discard you after one tough week?  I almost divorced my wife and when she realized I was serious that being alone would make me happier than me being with her the way she was she started to change. Bit by bit she stopped the insults, the backstabbing, and all the other shit. She still does it occasionally but nothing like it was before and nothing I can't handle. Realize that your wife is nothing you can't handle either."

I don't get many.  /u/UEMCGill is correct in that we either miss them or blow through them.  I'm the latter.  But they are easy to blow through.  However, I just posted about one I dealt with yesterday that was interesting enough to me to warrant an MRP morbidity and mortality report.  How does MRP Help ME?  MRP gives me the tools be able to handle those little tests and treat the larger ones with extreme prejudice.  MRP give me the tools to spot covert contracts from within... and from her.  MRP gives me to the tools to maintain true OI.  MRP gives me the tools to remember that I need to constantly prepare for her replacement should she drive me to that point.  MRP gives me the tools to learn from the mistakes you all make even when I don't make them (yet.)  MRP allows me to help others which by extension allows me to see my own issues from a third-party position."

You may be on top of you game right now, but the only way to stay there is to keep practicing and studying.  Look at someone like Tom Brady or another top athlete. You think he skips watching game film or meeting with his coaches? My guess is that he spends more time studying then most of his peers. That's how you make things last."

marriedredpill,3dme6j,UEMcGill,3,Fri Jul 17 13:29:47 2015 UTC,"OP says ""many"" shit tests, so my follow-up question is: How often do you get shit tests? I'm relatively new to this, but I'm just not seeing many shit tests either. They do happen, so sure AWALT, but I can think of only one in the last few weeks. As you said, either I am blowing through them or oblivious. I find it hard to believe I'm oblivious to something like a shit test.  But back to my original question, and maybe a better question for the OP, how often are different men getting shit tested?"
marriedredpill,3dme6j,MisterRossPeterson,0,Fri Jul 17 13:55:16 2015 UTC,"Shit tests are anything.  Guilt tripping, begging, asking you to do something she knows you hate, telling you to do anything.  Your reaction to almost everything she says and does is being judged."
marriedredpill,3dme6j,Moldy_Gecko,3,Sun Jul 19 03:15:35 2015 UTC,"/u/Dasugo this really is the only answer.  AWALT MRP provides insight to better understanding the dynamics of the relationship and answers the how/why women are the way they are.  My sex hasn't increased, I've been having sex 4-7 a week since we married in 2008. Kinky, pornstar, 'romantic' all sorts of sex.   It has helped me not hold her to the standard I hold myself as women don't love Men the way Men view Love.  I've learned that Men are the more romantic of the sexes when prior to TRP/MRP I would have laughed that off.  Like you MRP taught me about Covert Contracts and the importance of removing them.   The biggest reason I stay active here is two fold.  1) MRP introduced me to the sidebar books, Stoicism, and the concept that as Men, We are Alone.  2) I want every Man to embrace his masculinity and own his shit. I get a little pissed when I read about 'Dead Bedrooms' because that's not what the fuck marriage is about. When I left the military I was surprised at how fucking far 'men' have fallen.  TRP/MRP provide that 'internet locker room' where we can all assist each other in raising our standard and taking back what was always ours, our Masculine Identity.  If I can help any Man take back what was his by birth, but was stolen from societies feminine powers, I will do that.   Iron sharpens Iron, MRP helps train the brain and keep you from becoming complacent.  EDIT  To specifically touch on 'Shit Tests'. I never had an issue with them because I've never taken my wife seriously. For that matter, I haven't taken life seriously, I employ the It's whatever when facing bullshit. Amused Mastery has been my natural default.  For Example:  Her: You think that girl over there is hot?  Me: Yeah, she looked better last night in her G-String though  or if it's a life event and shit goes south, well, whatever I'll make it work somehow. I think this mindset positioned me to grasp and practice stoicism quite well."

You could be in the kids toys industry and the people at the top will be Lions and sharks. I have never met an executive or successful person who was an excuse filled beta motherfucker, man or woman.   It's akin to owning your shit, just in your professional life. Your alpha presence is defined by you, not the area you work in. LEO, PT, small business owner -- none of those are inherently manly, you alone are responsible for being that ""alpha"" presence. You do this by taking ownership instead of deflecting responsibility.  The things I talk about in your married life - owning your shit, giving value, having standards - are just as applicable in your professional life.    Outcome independence - you do the best damn job you can do irrespective of recognition. Abundance mentality - if your job isn't up to your standard, you know that you provide enough value that you can find a new one. 2a. Self respect - you know what your worth is and what your market value is, you expect to be treated fairly.   All the concepts that are talked about are taking ownership for your life and getting rid of the fear of failure. Those are great professional skills. There's too many people who are happy being average and mediocre all while bitching about how much they hate their job - those people suck."
marriedredpill,3dme6j,whinemoreplease,3,Fri Jul 17 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"Bull shit.  I posted a thread here asking specifically if I had blind spots in my marriage and the consensus was no, my wife just isn't a shit tester.  My wife does NOT shit test me.  I don't know why, and I kind of wish she would just so I could practice RP, but she doesn't.  She lets me come and go as I please with no backlash.  I control the finances and I can spend money as I wish.  She has a higher libido than me, so I get sex as often as I want.  She never berates me.  She wants me to lead her.  She believes in traditional gender roles of a submissive wife and a masculine husband.  As for what I get out of MRP, mostly ways to improve myself.  Here's a short list of things I've internalized from MRP...   Women want to be led.  They want a strong man that will make the hard (and easy) decisions.  I went from asking her opinion to telling her what we are doing.  It has been very well received. I stopped my covert contracts.  I was constantly bitter because she only works part time, yet the house is always a fucking mess.  It was always a touchy situation since her kids live with us and she wanted to be the one to give them orders.  Fuck that.  Now I take control and assign chores for the kids to do. I get shit done.  If there is a project around the house that needs to be done, I captain up and do it.  I don't let it sit for weeks before I ""get around to it"". I stopped making love to my wife and started fucking her.  I don't wait until the mood is right.  If I want sex, I grab her and pull her into the bedroom, pull her pants down and fuck her. I also stopped being so concerned about whether she orgasms or not.  She has tried to tell me 100 times that her body just works that way.  I now believe her.  And, to my surprise, lifting that expectation off of her has made her orgasm a lot more.  Who knew? Frame.  I've become more confident in my dealings outside of my marriage.     My shit tests are now coming from my 11 year old daughter, who has adopted the feminist entitled mindset.  ""Ladies first"", ""Let the lady sit down"", blah blah blah.  I keep hammering home that she doesn't get special treatment because she's a girl."
marriedredpill,3dme6j,angels_fan,3,Fri Jul 17 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"She believes in traditional gender roles of a submissive wife and a masculine husband.   IMO this is the key and why things worked differently for our parents or at least grandparents (depending on your age). I would view this as her frame aligning with your frame in the very important aspect that you are the leader, boss, etc. and it is without question. She probably has shit tested you, you passed (maybe unknowingly - early in your relationship), and now she has submitted to you. This is the ideal wife... I could see many men getting bored with a wife like this actually but I think it is THE wife you want if you want a lasting relationship.   EDIT: oh classic with the daughter too.. when the ship is sinking it's ladies first but soon enough she'll talking about college and wanting to be a strong independent woman (which good for her - as long as she doesn't try to make that reality coexist with 'woe is me dainty girl, ladies first'... i fear for the day i possibly have kids, good luck on those teenage years"

Just because we don't register them (i.e. brush something off as unimportant) doesn't mean it doesn't happen.   In that thread,   I don't have the patience or tolerance to deal with unnecessary crap.   The practical application is that if it's not important to me, I don't dwell on it.   For some guys, it's beneficial to think of it in terms of getting shit tested, for others, it's not because they don't even see it (read as aren't as sensitive to them) because it's just not that important.  It's one of those, if you look for it, you'll find it type of situations. Focus on doing what works for you.  Good call on teaching your daughter to not be self-entitled.

(to be fair if I'm concentrating I can pick them out after the fact, I always swat them probably thanks to my upbringing)   I however do commonly fail comfort tests, they just look so similar to me, that often they get ignored as more babble.

(my reputation is littered with me walking away saying something wasn't good enough) In turn her comfort has let her know what she SHOULD address to me, instead of being completely silent regardless of what happens. Fuck, sometimes it's not a joke and I do need to know what the hell is going on. It's also made me much more aware of what she says even during babble, it's too easy for me to lose small useful info by simply concentrating on what i'm doing to the exclusion of all else.   Thank you Mrp! And also hope this helps you out op."

I haven't been giving lectures like the one in this post, but I've deliberately avoided go-fetch mode if she just states a problem or fact and not a request.  ""That bag needs to come inside.""  ""My windows are rolled down and it's going to rain.""  ""It's almost suppertime.""  Etc....  I've tried to make it clear that reasonable requests, reasonably requested, will be honored. But I've probably been shitty in passive-aggressively being non-responsive until simply asked to do something that I'm otherwise not interested in doing.  If my wife weren't virtually crippled due to chemotherapy complications, I'd use the simple you-have-two-legs-do-it-yourself thing, but her two legs hardly work right now, so I'm more go-fetchy than this sub would approve of. Still, I'm trying to get train her to ask for help with at least a little intention and respect rather than just stating that a problem exists.  In short -- yeah, the door's open. If you want it closed, just say so, and I'll probably close it without argument.  But something about how I'm going about is just registering as me being an asshole, and in a ""you're always pissed off and the tension in here is making everyone uncomfortable"" way, not a ""you're now a guy with boundaries who doesn't take shit, and that's hot"" way.

She did something that you explicitly gave her permission to do. She is going to be passive aggressive, hamstery, etc. because AWALT. And anyway, maybe she didn't intend it... but what are you doing?  You've thought about it all day. All goddamn pathetic day. That means she has pulled you into her frame. Step back into your frame. She had fun without you? Good. It's pointless self-flattery to tell yourself that she should mope around and not have fun because you aren't there. And why do you wish that was the case? Because that's how you feel. And you want her to feel the same way. But AWALT.   I didn't see anything here about how you were enjoying yourself and doing things that YOU like. You have oneitis and you are completely in her frame.   My advice is to reply: ""Oh, cool, tell <friend> hi if you see him again. Had fun doing <hobby or cool activity> last night. Going to hang out with <some guys - brothers, uncles, old town friends, whatever>, shoot some pool, have some beers.""  Outcome independence. Frame. Focus on your happiness. You are the reward. If she wants to waste time trying to manipulate you, that's her business. The more she fails, the more riled up she'll be and ready to be pounded when you get back.

However, you didn't say she couldn't go out drinking with a guy you know. It's another shit test, pure and simple. She's trying to test whether your objection was based on weakness (fear & insecurity about her cheating) or principle (my wife doesn't go out drinking with other men when I'm not around).

marriedredpill,3dkk01,LeMachina,2,Fri Jul 17 12:38:38 2015 UTC,"Day trip is just as bad as night out. My wife is horniest around noon time +/- couple hours. How hard is it to get a cheap motel to screw their brains out and then go on a day trip date? Not hard at all.  That's why what your wife is doing, going out alone with guys (friends or not) while you're not home is a giant fucking red flag. Also regarding your friend, many guys have found out the hard way when their girls slept with their best friends, fathers, brothers etc. Not saying he would do that to you, but if he did you would be the last to know. Also why is he meeting with her alone at night without his girlfriend? Food for thought.  So once again, what your wife is doing is a giant fucking red flag and the fact that you've read MMSLP is good but you may be late to the game if she is actively looking for tingles. You better be lifting and getting ready to exit that clusterfuck. The one willing to leave first hold the most power and it sounds like oneitis has you in a headlock.  Have you been lifiting? How is your SMV compared to hers? Has she been fucking you? Where is she in her cycle? Is she ovulating? Closing in on her period? ETC? Any kids?  Frankly if you just read MMSLP and couple of things from the sidebar but not been lifting and your SMV is shit compared to hers then pulling exclusivity or threatening to do so is going to sound like weak sauce. Either she's going to take you up on your offer or she's going to brush it off and go on her day date with the ex.  Frankly I'd go dark. Don't call her, be too busy or unavailable until you get back home. Then watch what she does, not what she says. Make sure you lift and increase your SMV before you start making waves like threats of pulling exclusivity. Either way, that you're frustrated and confused tells me that your subconscious has recognized signs of potential infidelity. You're listening to what she is saying but your other senses are seeing what she is doing and they are warning you."

If it's high enough, i.e. you could go find another girl to fuck in less than 24 hours, then radio silence could be effective in shutting this shit down.  Otherwise, start ramping up the dread with a vengeance.  Put yourself in a position to ~cheat~ reassert your manhood with another woman as quickly as possible.

Hang out with old friends, go out alone and meet new people...whatever. Ignore any of the calls or texts she sends you that day. You don't want her to think you're sitting alone worrying and shitting your pants because this other guy makes you nervous, and that's what she'll think if you answer on the first ring or reply immediately.   You need to believe that her losing you would be a huge mistake on her part, and also understand that you'll be alright in the end, because as the awesome guy you are you'll have another, hotter girl once she's gone. Even if it's not true, you need to have that mindset to be able to pass these kinds of shit tests.

How RP has helped me, by being stoic and staying in your frame she starts getting the leadership she needs. They will never admit to it in a 1000 years but they need to be told what to do.

I don't know how girls are affected, but be aware she might not have the urge for sex because of the meds  And she may end up getting foggy, or zombie-like.. sometimes tunnel vision. It's really good to deal with on a person to person level, but while it helps curb the lows, it also cuts off the highs.  As for the 'we're not going to make it' that seems comfort test to me. That actually looks like good news.   shes dreading.. dread encourages women to step up using the words 'we'. right there that should give you the hope you need. And yeah, thats awesome, you only have one problem with her. Too bad it's a showstopper.   But you'll probably be getting a lot of comfor tests. I don't mean this in a bad way, but the way you describe your stuff, she does sound like she's broken, and needs the knight to come over and save her.  Hopefully this doesn't make her codepndant or use you as a crutch... it's a nice ego boost at first, but it would be better for you if she genuinely wants to get better  And take it for what its worth, in your situation. I would kind of get cold and clinical about it. X needs fixing, get on Y. Keep your boundries and needs in the back of your mind, and adjust based on how much she's committed to it.

marriedredpill,3dj6o2,Throwawaydontdox,11,Thu Jul 16 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"Red Pill Sexual Strategy  I want to address a misconception you seem to have about RP:  Sexual strategy is the main purpose of this sub , not because it results in sex, but because women make decisions regarding relationships from a place of emotion and those emotions (towards you) are derived from a place of sexual power.  If she thinks she controls the sex and you let her, then you let her control the relationship.  The moment you stop responding to her control of sex is the moment she realizes that she no longer has any power at all.  We call this frame; maintaining our own strength and control in spite of her attempts.  Since how we present ourselves physically, mentally, and verbally is a direct reflection of how she perceives our frame and since those things influence how we present our frame, maintaining mind, body, and presence are the keys to maintaining control over ourselves.  Once we can control ourselves, no on can control us.  this makes us strong.  Strong males are invested little in women and women know this; your wife knows this.  Once you are strong and alpha (to her) she will automatically take the position that you are out of her control and are very likely to pursue other options (hamstering.)  Her method for making sure you don't pursue other options is to have sex with you (mate-retention.)  When we have sex with her, we are usually more amenable to being around her, but a strong alpha male will not disregard poor behavior because he had sex 8 hours ago, so eventually she learns that not only is sex necessary to keep her husband around, but being submissive and feminine are required to.  And no matter what she does, be it withhold sex, be a harpy, try to fight for dominant position in the relationship, cheat on you, or leave you, the alpha male isn't fazed because his strong frame allows him the ability to find other women quickly (abundance mentality) and to not care what she does (Outcome Independence.)  As long as you are the best (but always improving) you that you can be, then you can't care what she thinks about you.  Why she simultaneously maintains the notions that withholding sex controls the relationship and giving sex controls the relationship we'll never really know... but the most common answer is: because hamster.  Your New Secular Life  I say this because it is post-pastoral.  Pastors, in my experience, all seem to be college graduates.  most of the time the college is a parochial school that streamlines the man into the pastoral position.  Most of the ones I've met seem to have a degree(s) in something along the lines of therapy or counseling.  I don't know if this is the case for you.  This may be a good choice of new career for you because, as I understand your ""job description"" most of it is guiding and helping people through some kind of issues (size notwithstanding.)    Ever Consider Writing?  Almost all Marriage Help books I've seen have been penned by some Christian leadership person... this leads these books to be Christian-marriage-centric.  Pre-RP... none of these would have worked for me because I am an Atheist.  Strip out the Christian language and you might have a good book, but I'd never know because basing the advice on scripture takes out about have the book.    I am acquainted with he very rigorous applications of marriage from a fundamental Christian standpoint... but all of these ""Marriage Help"" books that take the Christian slant are all based in feelings and helping her.  Many of the examples the authors give about how a parishioner of theirs had a problem and he solved it seem to be written too happily and to like a parable where he the hero (he) wins no matter what.    The only one that helped is MMSLP because it was a realistic view of male-female relationships and wasn't faith-based.  I mention books because you have to not-common position of being a pastor who is also RP.  You have the unique ability to tailor a Christian marriage message to also be RP.  You have the even more unique position of being able to write an RP marriage book without the Christian slant but being written by a pastor.  Non-religious RP guys would read it because RP, and Christian men would read it because you're a pastor.  So, perhaps you should spend these next months absorbing as much RP info and knowledge as you can, apply it against marriages you've seen in your work, against your own marriage (objectively) and get to coming up with an easily-digestible book.  But if Writing isn't Your Thing   Do you have a degree in anything? Do you hold certifications in anything? Do you have a professional network? Have you specialized anything (beyond pastoral-specific work.) Do you have work experience outside of pastoral work.   These are the things you need to have to be mildly successful.  Use SMART Goals to identify options, narrow those options down to your top three favorites, then apply what resources and time you have against those options to pick the best one.  At this stage in your life you need to be focusing on something.  Good luck.  In the meantime: Get a hobby, build something, and lift!"

Dixie is a hard place to make an easy living as a pastor.  However, I think you're in good shape.

You won't get ""rich"", but some of those positions can segue into much more lucrative positions with medical-oriented companies, if you play your cards right.  If your forte is networking, not administrative, the fundraising side is for you.  Learn how to write grants, hold conferences, and throw fundraisers and you're golden.  Spend two years developing industry contracts while you do that, and when the inevitable medical marketing position comes available, you'll be perfectly positioned.  Central Florida is a hot-bed of medical issues, thanks to the retirees, and it's a favorite destination for physicians, professionals, and paraprofessionals in the industry.  Learn Spanish - right now.  And emphasize your Southern approach to hospitality and friendliness on your resume.

His 2 year old sister will hit him and he'll tell me as opposed to hitting her back. Even when I say, ""Well, hit her back"" he says, ""No, she's my sister"".  If kids pick on him or bully I will tell him that he needs to understand that these kids probably don't have Moms or Dads who teach them the right way to live and how to be a good person.   But, kids are kids and I've taught him that it is his responsibility to do the right thing and ensure others do to. This has led to him going up to an 8 year old that said 'Shit' who was much bigger than he was and telling that little fuck that that's a bad word and you can't say it no fear, no hesitation, nothing but confidence. The kid stopped and said, 'Ok'  My wife is the Assistant Director at his camp and one of the counselors told her. When I heard I was proud as fuck. He knows there are bullies and he knows that if someone bigger ever picks on someone smaller or a strong kid bullies a weak one that I expect him to step in between them and defend the weaker person.   If it comes to physically throwing down then so be it. He is 5, but he needs to know that he'll have to defend himself, his sister, and the weak throughout his entire life.  I plan to take the spartan path and when he turns 7 I will begin with more chores, more physical labor, more reading/writing, and a higher standard. It will be a sort of 'Agoge'"

marriedredpill,3di375,th3STlG,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:04:37 2015 UTC,"Greece is very mountainous so the climate varies depending on altitude.  The highest point is mt Olympus (far north of Sparta) and is ~9500 feet (not high) but there are other peaks that are above 9000 feet.  It may snow sometimes up there.  The western portions of Greece are where the alpine climate is.  It's most likely to snow there if anywhere.  The southern parts of Greece are classic wet/dry Mediterranean climate.  There are almost no extremes in temperature and while it snows sometimes nothing ever sticks.  In order for the story to be plausible the children would have to be carted to the other side of the country and left there.  It's more likely the child would survive a singular wolf thN the entire trip back home, alone, on foot."

EDIT  To clarify, if a small kid is bullying a big kid the same rule applies."
marriedredpill,3di375,TrainingTheBrain,9,Thu Jul 16 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"You've taught your son a moral framework - cursing is wrong, bullying a smaller child is wrong (is bullying a larger child wrong?).  Moral frameworks - right/wrong, good/evil, should/shouldn't are incredibly useful tools of control.  It's all well and good when the framework ensures order, but it can also be used to cause people to subjugate their own best interest (see the feminine imperative).  Getting caught up in right/wrong, shoulds and whether or not something is ""fair"" delivers a simplistic but highly flawed view of the world that will always be susceptible to manipulation by individuals that feel no need to work within your framework.  When you start to pick apart a moral framework you start to realize that everything that is good is just what is most convenient to the person in power.  Your son at some point needs to be able to reason through the decision to decide for himself and question assumptions.  Any time you find someone using some sort of appeal to morality (the world ""should"" is a huge clue) then he needs the tools to analyze it.  You can approach situations like the bully by having him see the motivations behind each person's behavior.  The bully wants to be respected and liked and is following the patterns he's learned in his family.  The smaller child has shown weakness and fear and the bully can sense that.  It's likely that the bully doesn't feel much in control of his situation.  From there the solutions are easier to come by - if you don't want to get bullied, don't show weakness.  If you want to stop bullying, rallying others socially in defense of the person is an effective countermeasure (and incidentally makes you the leader).  If what the bully wants is respect then you insinuate that his behavior is weak and makes him lose social standing."
marriedredpill,3di375,enfier,2,Thu Jul 16 18:02:51 2015 UTC,"This is a great discussion piece.  To be completely honest I guess what I'm trying to develop for my son is a sense of embraced Masculinity & controlled emotional states.   Control what you can, don't let what's out of your control bother you too much, and try to understand what causes the actions others are taking.  Now, obviously I want him to do this in a manner which gets him the most from this life. By sharing his success as well as failures these things cannot be used against him. By understanding the motivations of others he can genuinely understand where they're coming from (as much as possible) as well as manipulate them if necessary.  I'd like him to get ahead personally and professionally without needing a TRP/MRP in his life. Embracing masculinity, competitiveness, violence, virtue, loyalty, honor, being romantic all things that society has fucked up for Men.  He will become his own Man and be influenced by his peers, my goal is to establish a solid foundation from which he can build his 'Self'."
marriedredpill,3di375,TrainingTheBrain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"don't let what's out of your control bother you too much   You've given him an ultimatum to fight on the weaker side, with very little context.  So, something completely beyond his control is supposed to make him physically fight people based on ""bullying?""  How smart is your kid? How does he know who is bullying who and who is fighting back?  By weight?   it is his responsibility to do the right thing and ensure others do to.   That's just dangerous. Why does it fall upon your kid's shoulders to ensure others do the right thing?  And what real skills does he have to determine that?  Because motivation to do the right thing is great, but isn't nearly good enough to teach your kid to put himself at risk in other peoples' squabbles."

Since he was a young kid (5 or so) he has had no fear of others. One time at a mcdonalds he went up to a 12 year old or so and snatched his car right back from him and told him no.   I subscribe to the same line of thinking. He needs to defend himself, his family, and if need be, the weak."

I am not a parent yet, but the thought is troubling to me. Where and how I was raised, I pushed  a kid down the staircase ( pushing was on purpose, staircase was because I pushed too hard ) when I thought he was picking on my friend.

He decided it was necessary to escalate to violence, whether it was justified will be case by case, but the overall point I will stress is that it happened and this is where it got us. Now we review what could have been done differently and if he learned anything.  I don't care what the school says, I will make the call. If he's suspended for standing up for himself, so be it. I'll still hold him to his academics at home and I'll be sure to speak to whoever is in charge at the school.  He is my son, that doesn't mean he's always right but I'll be damned if I don't defend his actions if I agree that they were justified.  Masculinity, aggression, and passionate emotion shouldn't be ostracized for 'the good of all' because in all honesty the only ones who benefit are the feminine folk. Men are suppressing what makes them Men and that leads to the bs we are all going through now."

marriedredpill,3di375,stonepimpletilists,2,Fri Jul 17 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"When my kids were getting bullied, they were afraid they'd get in trouble if they stood up for themselves. We had tried everything else that had been recommended (reporting, calling parents, etc.) and nothing ever worked.  So I acknowledged to them that yes, there's a possibility they'd get in trouble. We discussed different scenarios, I told them how to handle various authority figures. I assured them unequivocally that I was in their corner, and if they got in trouble I would back them 100%. If they got written up or we got called in to the school or whatever, they would not be in trouble with us at home. I assured them that at their age, one incident like this in their school record wouldn't be a big deal. No one was going to care if they got in one altercation when they were in lower elementary school. I told them that several incidents showing a pattern would be bad. But one? Who cares? Besides, we had plenty of documentation of the ongoing bullying.  In a more general sense, it's a fine line. If you're going to teach them not to be intimidated, they can't be intimidated by the results, either. They have to understand the consequences going in, and they have to be prepared to stand by their actions and decisions. And as a parent, you have to be prepared to be responsible for the ultimate outcome."
marriedredpill,3di375,Thorla,5,Thu Jul 16 22:24:08 2015 UTC,"Getting made fun of occasionally is a part of life. You're supposed to face some difficulties as a kid so you're prepared for adult life. I think the adult ways of handling this (frame, boundaries, passing shit tests) are the exact right way to go about it. And sure, he might not get it right the first time and they'll make fun of him for it. He'll do a bit better next time, and eventually he'll get good.  As to actual bullying, I got that as a kid. A lot, for several years from 4th to 6th grade. I was a skinny nerd. Eventually I noticed that my bullies laughed with me when I annoyed a teacher, and it sort of clicked that I could change it. I became a bit of a brat, and got my mom to get me some proper clothing and a proper haircut, and things improved tremendously.  In 8th grade I change school, and some 10th graders had this idea that physically bullying us in the school yard was really funny. I didn't take lightly to bullying, so I began on muai thai. After two months when one of the big 10th graders tried to bully me I got him in a thai clinch and kneed him in the chest 10 times. That was the last of that. The class AMOG felt the need to fight me a couple of times per year, but other than that no one touched me.  I'm giving my son a better start than I got. I began taking him to judo at age 4. Judo, like wrestling, has kids sparring at full strength right from the beginning. He's 6 now and he's got 5 judo tournament medals on his wall. He can take down and wrestle anyone without training unless they're at least 50% heavier than him. He's dressed well and he has a cool fauxhawk (at least in the morning, it's always messed up by the end of the day).  My daughter is 4 and she's a natural charmer and shit tester. She'll do fine."

My wife of course, was mortified. I laughed my ass off when she told me.   Thing is, nobody messed with him. From that day on he was that guy that got along with everyone.

marriedredpill,3di375,stonepimpletilists,2,Thu Jul 16 14:12:18 2015 UTC,"I was bullied in school, and it's tough.  In hindsight, and in the spirit of owning my shit, a lot of it stemmed from me. Yeah, the others were assholes, but I played a big role in it too. Kids will pick on anyone they see as different or weak.  I was kind of an outcast because I wasn't the typical farm kid - my parents not only raised me with different life goals than most of my peers, but taught me that the stuff the others did was low-value. I internalized that and turned it into snobbery.  They also avoided getting me physically active (no hockey team, no expectations to stack firewood at more than a girl's pace, etc). And they never instilled the spirit of standing up for myself because I was important. Whenever I stood up for myself it came out as a victim puke - emotional, whiny, and followed up by ineffective attempt at violence.  This isn't me blaming my folks, it's just an objective look back.  So I would advise outlook: teach him that he has value and is a good kid and self-esteem and so on. Confidence.  The stoic ideas for not getting as worked up about people saying shit are good.  Treat the shit as a shit test - I think that's part of it. Jockeying for social standing, you have to be able to play the game.  Teach your kid to stand up for himself when he needs to, but not over-react out of anger. I firmly believe that if I had been calm, assertive, and willing to give (or more likely, take) a beating a few times things would have been much better.  Coming off as a worked up victim just played into their game.  And get him doing physical stuff. Sports, hockey, football, play games like ""how many pushups can you do"", helping do hard work around the house (carry heavy jugs of water to the backyard for watering flowers, etc).  It will help him feel more secure and also help him fit in and gain social status with his peers, specially team sports. And had I been able to back up my temper with an actual punch that had some meat behind it, it would have helped.  And if shit really goes south, be there to stand up for him and show him you've got his back. Not like an overprotective mommy, - make him deal with as much as he can. But there's nothing worse than being told worthless platitudes by your parents as they stand by and watch you get the shit beat out of you daily."
marriedredpill,3di375,marxistbacon,2,Thu Jul 16 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"I've been semi anti-authoritarian since grade school. Early on in school a very alpha dog alpha male boy commanded my class (and we were with the same class every year, small school). About 3/4 of the boys followed him and his lead. He was our grade's self appointed Caesar.   The rest of us chumps , for either not being accepted (or in my case) not wanting to blindly be a follower made us part of the picking-on pool. Or some combination of the two.    Being part of that group I had to sometimes fight, sometime defuse. Most of the time a/a style defusal would work. Sometimes it would backfire when I didn't apply correctly (whereas the cronies and all the girls would take my amplify away from me if weak and amplify further for me). It was a long painful learning process, but I learned a lot from it.   As much as parents we want to replace bad learning experiences with our own knowledge...it only goes so far.  For little girls ganging up on a boy, ignoring works a lot and/or removal from their sight. Little girls tend to focus on one thing , and that thing needs to be right in front of him. But little girls ARE looking for entertainment. If he can't leave then jokes/ a.a. (kid level) should be tried, but all with a ""I give no shits"" aires of confidence in the face of their onslaught. If he tries to return the attack back then they'll pounce in numbers and little girls love to label, love to get others in trouble, feel out their hen pecking abilities.   Coach em on taking the high road. Seeing the girls shit as beneath him.   For boys, he should have a better read on it. Sometimes he'll be able to smooth things over, others he may have to fight. For that I'd highly recommend putting him in a program like Gracie Bullyproof, or other aikido / grappling arts. Because at that age you get out-stronged by another boy just by being a year or two younger. He can't out lift childhood development. So it's better to know how to move, be fast. Etc."

I just told him to stand up for himself and that he needs to solve his own problems. I just told him to be smart about it.   For instance he had a problem with someone on the bus teasing him about some shit, he came home all upset and told us about it. I told him to confront the kid. So he did, he got off on the kids bus stop one day on the way home and had some words with him, problem solved. No violence necessary just a threat of great bodily harm if he continued.

That was normal back then and to some degree is normal today. It taught the other boys you were to be respected with regards to physical space. While a fist fight is not the solution today, extreme confidence and a die hard ability not to back down is.   As regards to vocal bullying. Your child giving a butthurt response is the absolute worst thing that could ever happen. Or telling on the other kids, that might be worse. The young child should learn not to internalize their behavior. Project an air of confidence and when the insults are directly funny, he should laugh. Shake it off, and keep going. If they are being cruel then its time to just leave. Girls bullying boys is normal at that age and simply going to play somewhere else is better. No direct responses should be given. If he is unable to leave from the area (i.e. slide) then he should ignore and continue as if nothing is happening.  Without the reaction, the girls will move onto someone else."

Don't try to force them to like you Don't try to mouth back if there is a group attacking Don't show them that they are hurting your feelings   People are all insecure and feel shitty about themselves and the most common way of feeling better, instead of growing as a person, is to attack others to bring them down.  I was too tall in elemetary, like 5'7"", pigeon toed, retardedly skinny, and shy.  Name rhymes with fairy, we will say Larry.  So like 4th day of riding the bus, ""Larry the fairy"" began getting chanted.  I was in kindergarten and sort of a hermit.  Parents didnt teach me how to handle it.  Dad said to fight.  Sure, a 5 year old fighting an 8 or 9 year old.  Mom just consoled me.  So I visibly showed I was distraught and hurt, so it only got worse.  Tried to mouth back some and it just got turned back on me.  Basically don't make yourself an easy target.  Rather, don't be a target at all.  I would say the best defense is either to ignore and brush it off, or you could try AA without so much amplification.  Agreeing always sort of stops the bullying.  ""hey, you're a faggot."" ""Yup"" ""Well you like to kiss weiner (Or whatever kids say)"" ""Yup""  Then at that point the kid may yell some stupid line: ""Hey, Larry likes to kiss weiner everybody!"" But the claim is so ignorant and outrageous itll die out in like 5 minutes.  And the other thing to teach kids is that it doesn't matter.  Typically bullies end up going no where in life and the things they say in grade school don't mean a thing.  Never take it personal and just keep moving along.

Starting with this one and there were a few recent updates if you scan through the last month or so of his posts.  The basic mistake you're making is letting yourself get put in the middle by listening to the bitching, and letting your wife make the judgements that she expects you to conform to. And being afraid to change the status quo by talking to either of them honestly and assertively.  Your wife is bitching to you about your mom in order to manipulate you into acting.  You don;t want to be the middleman for your wife here.   The business about not getting a confirmation - you should take the lead and get it done. Don't assume. Assumption is the mother of all fuckups. And I smell weakness - were you afraid to get confirmation because what if she said no, and your wife had a freakout? OMG, better not stir things up!  You were not honest or assertive with either your mother or your wife in any of these interactions (the email, the freakout, the lawn tractor). Now you're paying the price.  Next time, take charge of making the planning and getting a positive confirmation.  Get your shit done. Tell your wife that she cannot unilaterally cancel your weekend plans because of a panic attack.   Right now you're afraid of confronting your mom about her gifts, and you're afraid of confronting your wife about her emotional freakout. And maybe you're feeling guilty because of your part in the process. No wonder things are a mess.

marriedredpill,3dibsv,enfier,3,Thu Jul 16 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"You can give a deadline or not give a deadline.  Giving a deadline and then assuming it's a ""no"" because she didn't get back to you is still lame. Is she absent minded? Being passive-aggressively late in replying? You don;t know. If it's important, take a few minutes and follow through.  If you want to make the weekend go smoothly, then take responsibility for making it happen. Clear definition of responsibility, no ambiguity. And generally, the responsibility should fall on you (or you should sieze it, rather than letting it fall). Make sure you follow through, ask a couple times if needed, confirm a day ahead if she's a little absent minded (mine is)."
marriedredpill,3dibsv,marxistbacon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:31:20 2015 UTC,"Take away their power.  Your plans shouldn't be contingent on whether your MIL will watch the kids.  If your wife cancels something without your approval, have her call back and tell the other person that she did not consult her husband and the plans are no longer canceled.  If your MIL gives you a gift you don't want after you tell her not to, get rid of it.  There will be crying."
marriedredpill,3dibsv,marxistbacon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:33:19 2015 UTC,"Also,  this comes after last night were after the kids went down I drew my wife a bath and to shave, ate her out for 15 minutes, then fucked her hard.  I also told her I want more blowjobs.  this is the first time I have ever said anything like that  Do you think that has anything to do with?"
marriedredpill,3dibsv,BluepillProfessor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:23:26 2015 UTC,"Actually not sure what you're asking.  Generally, though, questioning part of your behaviour. You're still drawing a bath for her (a.k.a. ""being really nice"") after she unilaterally cancelled your weekend and got your mom in a snit? Rewarding bad behaviour is not productive.  Telling her you want more blowjobs is good - sounds like you're making baby steps in asserting your needs and it feels strange. Telling your needs, though, not asking or begging to have them met, though - a big difference. Again, make sure you read WISNIFG if you haven't yet."

I imagine if we dig deeper we'll see the whole monogamous to your mother situation from NMMNG.  You need to take charge of arranging babysitting if it's with your mother.  Not only to avoid situations like this but in general it's more Alpha to say ""I'll take care of it"".  Then later say ""My mom will be here at 6.""  She doesn't need to worry about it.  You don't tell your wife anything until you have a firm yes or no unless she asks.  Then it's a simple, she still needs to get back to me.  It's extremely weak looking to cower to your mother as an adult/father/husband/leader.  You can probably just say something to that effect to your mother.  She'll get it."

It is totally ass backwards to your way of thinking.  You think, she takes control of it.  she must want to do it.  When in fact, she doesn't want to and is pissing her off that she has to do it.  That is why she is pissed off at the little things.  Don't worry.  Fake it till you make it and then it's like a fucking light bulb goes off and it starts to become more natural."
marriedredpill,3dibsv,The_Litz,3,Thu Jul 16 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"Looks like you successfully recruited your mom's doppleganger and married her.  You have three issues to address.  The two of them and your personal shortcomings.     Step 1 - no lies.  Mom is an asshole, own it.  Stop her from ruining your relationship.   Objectionable behavior on her part will stop once you decide to become an adult.  Childhood is over.  Step 2 - do not accept childish behavior from your wife.  Or anyone other than a child.  Pretty easy.   Act with your wife like you acted with your mom (step 1.)  Step 3 - You will have accomplished your transformation when you have successfully addressed 1 and 2.     Being trapped between two women is a fool's errand.   If they can't behave, it's up to you to train them."

Every night I take off my socks I throw them at her-it's been known to start a wrestling match which leads to a naked wrestling match.  If I get up first, I start her vehicle, crank the music as high as it'll go, then turn the vehicle off.  I'll also push her seat as far up as it'll go.  If I make her a sandwich I always take a bite.  I purposely misuse ""that's what she said.""  Wife: you have any clothes to throw in the washer?  Me: ""that's what she said""  I'm not above a wedgie.  If she's in the shower I'll grab her through the curtain, she freaks out every time.  (The psycho reference gets her)  I'll play ""paraplegic"" where if she wants to go somewhere I act like I'm paralyzed to make sure she's ready to take care of me if I'm ever in an accident. She's gotten pretty good at dressing me without any cooperation.  I generally torture the hell out of her, and she returns the favor any chance she gets.  Little bitch dumped a pitcher of ice water on me in the shower the other day.  I agree the house definitely runs smoother when someone is plotting or executing the next move.

Another time we were in line at the movie theater and I told her I had to go to the bathroom. I slapped her on the ass, in line in front of everyone and told her I wanted a small popcorn and a medium coke to put the rum nips I brought into. Her mouth dropped and I just walked away. Not so romantic, but, idgaf.  Her ass, tits, waist they are like magnets to our hands. You have to be smooth and not 'clingy'. Don't do it for attention, do it because you want to touch her.  Her: I feel like an object  You: Did you think you'd still be my sexy little object after X# years of Marriage??  or   Her: Why do you always touch me?

Just last weekend: she has some strange little shit fit when we go somewhere and my passenger seat has been moved. 2 or 3 times out of the week I go to lunch with coworkers. She used to try to shit test disguised as a comfort test of ""who's been riding in your car"" totally stupid. I've been shooting that one down every time but she's like an obsessive compulsive with this particular thing.   So anyway she bitches about my seat and I say ""dunno, maybe one of the 3 other people who could have sat there this week?""  ""You should tell them to move it back""  ""Yeah that's funny. Hey coworker, my wife's a control freak about the seat position. You mind me having this awkward conversation with you while I ask you to move it back?....um no""  We get to the grocery store on the way to the in-laws and she jumps out to pick up a last minute food item.   I turn to my kid in the backseat ""watch this"" and subtly tilt the seat forward.   She gets back gets in and is wondering why the fuck shes leaning all funny. We all have a laugh.   Morale is, fuck with your wife. Especially fuck with her common shit tests to nullify and inoculate yourself against a particular strain. At least when she has to shit test now she's going to have to be more creative. There's no way in hell I'm not going to laugh about the seat from here on out. And I'd wager her,too."

Start out by teasing/negging her positive attributes if the opportunity presents itself. Most Agree & Amplify responses are teasing and playful in nature.

Honestly, you've got to pick between being a SAHD and having a fulfilling sex life. A SAHD is a man who is dependent on his wife. A dependent man can't lead. A man who can't lead is weak. Women are disgusted by weak man. A dependent man doesn't have any options. In short, his beta support is locked in.  When you become locked in, when you become the default, your needs are very easy to ignore, because realistically, what are you going to do about it? You're stuck if you let things continue that way. A stuck, weak man isn't exactly an excitement generator and your wife is going to hunt for her tingles elsewhere.  Decide. Sex life, or SAHD. The choice is yours."

I've almost completely given up on initiating sex because of the failure/success rate and so its fallen on her to initiate sex and with her never thinking about it, you can see where it goes.   Don't do that.  You already handed your wife your balls by being a SAHD and now you are letting her control sex by being the one to initiate exclusively?  Those times you have sex don't involve an extra-large strap on with super thick ribs do they?   I feel trapped because I don't want to upset my wife with cheating, but I feel its the only option left.    No it's not.  You think we are going to hold your hand and give you permission to cheat while you whine like a bitch?  Think again.  You have a LOOOOOOOONNNNNNNG way to go to go from absolutely pathetic and cringeworthy to become even slightly attractive and you want to start cheating already?    The fact your wife fucks you at all, even though you continue to play the woman and force her to initiate is actually an extremely good sign.  Be attractive, don't be unattractive.  Read the sidebar.  Start with Married Man Sex Primer by Athol Kay.   've brought up fantasies and sex toys, role play and so on and she just doesn't seem that into any of it.   Actus Non Verba.

My wife doesn't really do any fitness   She doesn't need to because you can't leave. Her investment to keep you around is not only zero, but it's reversed. Hell, she could cheat on you and because she holds the cards financially you can't do shit about it.    I feel trapped because I don't want to upset my wife with cheating, but I feel its the only option left.   That's because she has you DOMESTICATED. Do you get that? She doesn't need to have sex with you unless she wants to because zero sex for you still keeps you in line. It's the same as a dude who has sex with a chick and leaves as soon as he's done with her, and she keeps having sex with him expecting to get a relationship she wants, just because she let him fuck her. It doesn't work that way.   Also, fuck her getting upset. What is she going to do, not have sex with you? Don't worry though. If you apply the principles you will see a turnaround.

I can't exactly walk off and start doing something else, since I do what I need to get done before she comes over, and she comes over specifically to hangout with me.   This is simple.  You are buying into her frame.  Hanging out doesn't have to = sex.  Your frame is hanging out = sex.  So stop hanging out if you don't get sex.    You have dated a single girl all through college in an apparent LTR.  Now you are already having problems with her fucking you?  So you come to a marriage forum, assuming your situation is the same as a lot of married guys.  OK, you got us on the last one.  I would TELL her before she comes over what you are going to do to her.  Flirt with her, whatever.  If she doesn't want to have sex after that then fuck yes I would leave.  If I were you I would go straight to the damn bar and practice my PUA game.  Do you think it is easier for married guys to leave your home and family after a hard denial like we recommend?   Usually, I'll throw her on the bed, start taking her clothes off, but if I get a hard no, I'll be like, cool, and start putting my clothes on. But, we are still there together. Is it okay to just watch a movie or go on a walk with her even while the weird-rejection atmosphere is about?   Get your ""no"" earlier in the day.  TELL her before she comes over what you are going to do to her.  Flirt with her.  If she says I am not in the mood or whatever tell her she is free to come over and hang out but you are going out.

My prediction, your next post will be again asking the experts- about Starfish Sex.   Never had a problem with Starfish Sex. I've always been domineering when it's come to sexual intercourse, and we've even incorporated ropes, handcuffs, blindfolds, etc. Also, as I described earlier, she loves the sex and gets off rather often.   I will have to work more on texting her and being flirty.

Not only she doesn't trust your leadership, she doesn't care for it at all.    if you've truly internalized the red pill when you'return rarely tested?   The shit tests decrease, but never really end. Btw, comfort tests are a kind of shit test.  Shit tests are a feature, a way to communicate.

Comfort tests disappearing usually means she doesn't think she needs to keep up her game, for whatever reason, ""doesn't need you anymore, feels like your smv had dropped to the point you couldn't get something else, you're acting too beta, you've cried wolf too many times, etc.""   I could easily be mistaken, but that's what I've watched out for. It's worked remarkably well for me.   Personally, I wouldn't be the most accurate judge.

You just have the normal issues that any two human beings will have when they have to interact and get stuff done together.  You're a natural alpha and you do not have the issues that beta men have. At all. I have what you have now, but about 6 months ago I would have sworn that my wife was the vilest person I'd ever known. The amount of scorn and contempt she'd show was unbelievable. I'm not sure anyone can relate unless they've seen first hand how cruel women get to their BBs. And I never did anything - I didn't cheat, didn't go fat, I treated her well, did stuff around the house, took care of the kids.  The only strange thing in your marriage is that you're alpha. There's plenty of natural alphas around, and you're one of them. You can probably tighten your alpha game and maybe go from good to great. But your wife is already happy with who you are. MRP isn't going to be the lifechanger for you like it has been for those of us who were betas.

However, her grandparents had a large hand in her upbringing and we all know that generation was much more redpill prone than future generations.  Both male and female.  So maybe their presence had a large hand in how she views relationships."

No back rubs or listening to her long ass stories.  Household chores..Yea..do those. Just be a bit emotionally detached and mind elsewhere. Stay civil. No fighting!  Then try sex again.

No acknowledging her feelings, like ""OK that's fine."" 2) Immediately go into another room or leave the house and DO something else (read a book, work on things, play videogames, anything).

marriedredpill,3dbbix,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:17:48 2015 UTC,"A relationship involves 2 people and 2 roles. Men want sex. Women want affection(hugging, talking, spending time together).  In short: Each time she refuses sex, you start refusing to do the above. If you get to the point she refuses sex and you are doing nothing of the above that she wants, break up with her and you look for another woman because any woman interested in you would want affection and to spend time with you.  It should never get to that, as you will see, wives realise that they don't call the shots and they still need to put in effort into the relationship or they will lose your commitment and resources.  So next time she refuses sex if its night time. Go straight to sleep and say night. That's it. If she wants to talk, tell her youre trying to sleep. If she wants to hug, push her away cause it disturbs your sleep. You've basically just done what she did to you - you refused her sex.   Next day try again for sex, and keep repeating and each time she refuses, you do less and less until either she starts having sex with you or you find out youre living with a roomate youre paying for. It's then your choice what to do, but there is no reason to stay with a wife who uses you for resources."

Now since then we didn't have sex however my father in law is visiting and staying with us so I'm playing tourist with him in the city. I really haven't asked for sex cause it has been too busy. But I have been dressing a lot better...she definitely notices and compliments up the wazoo. We go for dinner with her father and he is telling her how good looking she is. Instead of my wife saying thanks to her father she says me??? My husband is the one killing it..squeezes my bicep and says he looks great. It is a great feeling knowing my progress is paying off...I notice..she notices..and I have had women look me up and down..I even had one turn back around and smile at me. I know more sex with the wife doesn't happen overnight but it is increasing and doing better. Also the fights have been non existent. I don't get into it with her and since I started mrp things have been a lot better

If its the latter then the advice given is good.  For the former, married women have the equivalent of Anti-slut defense, think of it as Moms-too-tired defense.  When it's MTTD, try priming the pump well ahead of time.  Tell her at 4 pm ""Tonight you're getting fucked."" Flirt, game and text her for the day.  It's much easier for her to accept she's having sex after being gamed all day.  Don't get her to say yes, instead make it so she can only stop it.  Just like if you ask her what she wants for dinner she might have a million ideas and no decision, but tell her you want steak and she's like ""Yeah that sounds good!"""
marriedredpill,3dbbix,theultmatecad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"Here is a another question I have. We both like similar tv shows. When we get home we usually eat dinner watch our shows together. Sex sometimes happens after but not so much because she gets full from dinner and doesn't like having sex on a full stomach. I can understand that. So I am trying to initiate sex before we sit down and what not. She has said no I am not in the mood etc before and we have sat down eat dinner and watch our shows. So in your guys opinion if she says no do I say ok no problem and sit down and eat dinner and watch tv with her and then just go read , walk, go to gym etc. or do I not even sit with her for dinner and go for a walk gym etc. there will be days I don't even ask for sex..I'm fine with every other day. So let's say Monday come home I don't want sex..we do our regular tv relax eat dinner etc. on Tuesday I want sex , we get home she says no I say no problem and instead of sitting for dinner I have my bag packed ready for the gym and go. This is what I think I will do. The next time go in my attic , I need to organize my tools. The thing is my wife is not a harpy , treats me very well except again for the sex. She is a smart girl and will pick up on the fact that I leave or do other things when she says no. In the past I would get mad and pissy but now it's not a big deal to me cuz like you guys have been saying Pussy dries up when you act like a bitch and it's true. I want her to pick up on it, the underlying question will come up are you mad, you left cause we didn't have sex...internally the answer is yes you dummy lol , but I have to maintain frame and still play up the no answer"

So if you continue to treat me like a child, then we will not continue to be married.""  Things are much better now.   For those occasions where she still gets bent out of shape over stupid shit, or is giving me a hard time for doing something I want (or need) to do, I verbalize her appropriate response. ""Thank you, husband, for all that you do.""  This guy is lucky in some ways because she came to this conclusion rather than the ""I'm not haaaaaappy"" one society encourages, resulting in a trip to divorce court. However, he is clearly a Nice Guy (tm) and avoided the Red Pill lesson that you have to stand up to your woman.   Men hold the bond of marriage in a higher regard than women do. It's a bond of honor, we don't take it lightly, and women know it. This is why shaming tactics about marriage work so well. That's why when she sees that you weigh the obligation against how much she puts into it, rather than your feelings of honor, her attitude changes considerably.  This lady became his mom (she even says it), and realized herself the dynamic was wrong. However, she is still taking the lead in working to change the dynamic.

marriedredpill,3danix,Sepean,3,Tue Jul 14 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"I had to deal with a lot of soft rejections, last minute resistance, etc.  What seemed to work best for me was to not be bothered by it, not listen to it, and initiate again. Agree & amplify can work, but keep it light - with too much pressure on her she answers back and you don't want it to develop into something that looks like you're arguing with her about whether you're fucking or not. Often it works better to just go with an amused mastery expression and say nothing. Change the subject and kino her later.   If it ends with a hard rejection (and often it will, that's just how it is in the begining) I would absolutely not say ""OK, no big deal"". Don't give of the impression that it is ok; it isn't ok. But you're not bothered by it, and you show that by not getting butthurt and just doing something else. You want her hamster spinning because she doesn't get why you're not reacting - you don't want to calm her hamster by telling her it is ok."

marriedredpill,3danix,Countpudyoola,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:39:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry, been busy at work today. Here's the summary of what happened:  Picked her up from airport around 9pm. Gave her a huge hug and deep kiss then took her bags and walked to the car. Normal catch-up talk while in the car and she was hungry and asked to stop for food. Went to a diner type restaurant since it was late and had some food and headed home. When we got there I pulled the bags into the house and dropped them and turned around and pulled her into me. Gave her another passionate kiss and started pulling her toward the bedroom. She said ""I'm exhausted honey, not right now."" I said OK, let go of her and pulled her bags into her bedroom. Then I left and went to the couch and went to read on my ipad. She went to her room, changed and got ready for bed and came out to the couch about 20 minutes later. Asked me a few things about the house (I had tidied up and done a few things around the house while she was gone). 5 minutes later she kissed me goodnight and went to bed without me. This morning I intended to go for morning sex but I actually got a call from one of my employees and I had to run to work. We'll see what happens when I get home tonight.  Overall, obviously not a success story on day 1. But like everybody has said... it's day 1 in a long process. I know I have a lot to learn and a lot to fix as well. I'm sure you guys can dissect what I wrote above and tell me what I did wrong and how you would've handled it.  A positive I did take away... she did compliment me on how good my body is looking. I've only been working out for about 10 weeks or so but she hasn't seen me in the last 3 weeks (edit to clarify-I've stayed fairly fit but only really started dedicated lifting in the last 10 weeks. I'm not a big gross slob or anything and play sports regularly in rec leagues). She also said at some point ""wow, who are you?"" in reference to me talking about what I've been cooking and eating and changes I've made in both diet and exercise habits. So, it's not all bad but still have a long long way to go. Thanks for the help and support guys."

The problem is at this point...sex for you in itself is out of the ordinary.   Surprise doesn't always work positively. The less talk, the less you talk yourself out of it. You build excitement at first with conviction and desire.   Words later , when all is even keel and the frequency is where you want it.... and even then rarely.

What you're proposing would be resetting your current frame with the wife. You can dive right on the deep end and act like Joe Cool and just ramrod a new frame, or you can work into it.   If you ramrod she's more likely to challenge it with, ""Not funny,"" or ""What's gotten into you?"" So you can change frame abruptly, but be ready for a large challenge to said frame if you do a la genuine confusion and/or shit tests. If you ease in, she will accept small changes incrementally until it's a whole new frame.   If you lack OI ease in. If you have OI then stir shit up and see what happens. Have fun with it."

If you put the frog into room temp water, and slowly raise the temp to boiling, the frog won't even notice, until it is too late.  The head fake is that the frog is YOU, not the wife. No one starts lifting weights maxing the bench press. You start light, get the the feel for the equipment, how your body reacts, oh look you can feel your biceps....and over time, you work up to being a real weight lifter.

This also reminded me of a time while backpacking where some animals took off with our food in the middle of the night.  We went the entire next day without food and didn't eat until the following day around lunch time when we finally made it back to civilization.  Best fucking burger of my life (It was at McDonald's)!
marriedredpill,3d8u5w,Sepean,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:02:26 2015 UTC,Everything tastes a little sweeter when you've earned it. The same goes for sleep. When you earn those hours of rest vice just 'going to bed' you'll understand what true rest really is.
marriedredpill,3d8u5w,Sepean,5,Tue Jul 14 13:09:08 2015 UTC,"I approve of this message.  I do ice cold showers on most days. I fast 16 hours each day. I regularly go out with clothing that isn't warm enough (this has the added benefit that I look better in t-shirts).  I embrace the awesome feeling of exercising strong character, self discipline and delaying gratification. And when I do take a warm shower, eat a nice meal or get inside in the warmth again, I genuinely appreciate simple sensations that for others are just what they're used to all the time."
marriedredpill,3d8u5w,strategos_autokrator,3,Tue Jul 14 12:29:51 2015 UTC,"The stoic philosophies, The Power of Now, and all related books on the topic of optimal existence touch on this exact point. By sacrificing and finding comfort in the discomfort, you are better able to appreciate and enjoy the aspects of life that are often overlooked.  As you stated - a warm meal, a blanket, driving a car, watching your kids, walking surrounded by trees. You actually feel and are in the moment as you are appreciating the moments of life.  It's why my wife and I have gotten rid of Facebook, twitter, and all excess. It's not about adding more but removing the unessential and from time to time, reminding yourself of how everything in your life can be taken from you and you'll still survive."
marriedredpill,3d8u5w,VictorERink,7,Tue Jul 14 12:37:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I lifted it from stoicism. It's good stuff.  Another thing I do: A calming technique is to take 4 slow breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth. I do that every morning before I step into the cold shower. I really hate that shower, but at the 4th breath I just move. There's some conditioning in this, and it has also become a personal ritual for me and the thought of not moving after the 4th breath, of breaking that magical streak, that's like sacrilege to me.  The 4 breaths technique, I can draw on that to do anything now. Once I make the decision and take the first breath, I'm doing it after the 4th and there's no way I'm chickening out. It's really powerful and taking the 1st breath is so much easier than doing the final, scary/tough thing."
marriedredpill,3d8u5w,VictorERink,2,Tue Jul 14 12:56:50 2015 UTC,"I like that and am going to see if it is something I can incorporate into my routine.   Something that motivates as well as letting me know that once the routine has begun, there is no turning back.   I've overridden the alarm bells in my mind so many times that I feel having a routine as opposed to just telling myself to suck it the fuck up may be a more effective and calmer approach to tackling the challenge before me.  Thanks for sharing that."

By the way, I also strongly recommend to everyone that struggles with this to join a sparring-heavy martial arts. Be it boxing, BJJ, whatever, something where you face another person and can hurt each other. This trains us to not be afraid of others.  I suck at BJJ. Everyone here is much bigger than me, so they pummel me. I would become desperate. But by sticking to it, I don't anymore. I can think, focus on technique, and now I do better.   I got used to just focusing on good breathing when i feel scared, and that takes all the adrenaline from fear into making me stronger. It is like a super power. I'm now holding my ground and even winning against bigger people. I've made many great friends. And I'm improving every class. I feel so much more confident now all around. If I can fight those big guys that know a lot more than i do regularly, then, why should I be afraid?"

Facebook can be useful, but for me I couldn't get over the BS people were spewing and for my wife the false connections disgusted her.  We both no longer have facebook and as she said yesterday, ""It's nice to go out without feeling I have to 'share' the moment with Facebook.""  Optimal Existence comes from being in the moment, not watching it and then promoting it. Some people can have Facebook no problem, some abuse it.

I would eat light through the day and have as large a dinner as I could manage in the evening, something I held over myself as a reward for making it those extra couple of excruciating miles, trying to finish the whole thing at least one day earlier than estimated. I would arrive in camp so exhausted and spent that I could barely walk around without using a hiking pole as a crutch. Then I would just get up the next morning and do it all over again. There is nothing else in my life other than lifting where I operate in this manner and it felt fucking good.  I don't consider 6 days on the AT to be shit compared to what many other hikers are pulling off out there, but it was a huge reminder of what my potential in life could be and at what kind of pain tolerance and force of will I can summon. I met no hikers out there who were going as hard and fast as I was. I met hikers out there who intended to do four days, yet quit within two, just because it was harder than they thought it would be. I realized by comparison that no matter how hard it got, how hot, or how much rain, or how dangerously shitty my knees felt, I would never quit, and instead would push myself to keep putting down 15 miles per day in sections where everyone else was doing 8-10.   We need this kind of thing in our lives, all of us. You have to shake it up and put some adversity in your own way if you aren't getting any naturally. There's no other way to improve yourself in a way where you internalize it permanently."

Any man who has his shit together is most definitely the gatekeeper to commitment.    And yes, that’s pretty fucked up if you, again, find yourself on the sharp end of it. Men’s adapting to the intersexual conditions set by women isn’t some deterministic prospect, but the idea that the mass majority of men would be responsible for the state women find themselves in is ludicrous.    I completely agree. Any man who then does find himself on the sharp end will either get his shit together right quick or fall by the wayside.

It's engaging in covert contracts and choreplay with an expectation of sex which is the problem.  Outside of maybe some rare fetishists, nobody gets turned on by watching or doing chores. They still need to be done though. Don't engage in that stuff with the idea that it's what gets you sex. Engage in washing the dishes, because the dishes need to be washed."
marriedredpill,3dat4b,RedPillForever,7,Tue Jul 14 21:43:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you think of them as chores. Chores imply they are assigned to you by someone. The fact that there is even a line of who does what chores or what is undoable is operating from her frame.  Think of yourself as the captain of the boat. This is your boat. The captain works harder than anyone else. He is always working, always inspecting, always fine tuning everything. He delegates to his crew many tasks, but in the end, the responsibility is his alone. If there aren't enough hands on deck to pull that line, he helps out. Not to get the approval of his crew, but because pulling the line helps his vision.  A good captain that notices some crew member not doing their job removes the crew member from responsibility and assigns them to another. There might be disciplinary action, but the focus is not on teaching crew members how to be nice, but on getting shit done. If a crew member isn't pulling his own weight, well, he can be left at the next port.  There is no job that is beyond the captain. There is no job the captain does to get approval from his crew. There is no job that is not the responsibility of the captain. There is no one that works harder than the captain. This is where leadership comes from.  A good captain can lead efficiently by delegating to competent people. But even if there are no competent people, the captain still has to get the stuff done and lead."

I work about 30 hours a week. She works 45-50 hours a week.  When I unplugged I told her I would be taking over the laundry, dishes, the boys homework (the biggest job on the list) and making dinner (almost) every night. I told my wife that she was doing more than her share and the only thing she should worry about when she gets home from work is how she is going to make me cum that night.  Don't mistake this for ""choreplay"" or a Covert Contract. That was before. Now it is OVERT- and I did not take over all those chores because I thought it might make her want to have sex with me.

It is what are the reasons you do the chores..  If you are doing the dishes because you think it will make her happy I promise you it won't she will point out the fact that you didn't clean the counters.

I do a lot of things around the house that I initially thought as being ""blue pill"" cooking and cleaning wise.  I do all of the cooking in my house and was worried that this was something that might prevent me from being a good alpha.  I love cooking had I not been a competitive athlete in college I would have probably ended up in culinary school.  After a while I realized I was missing out on a perfect opportunity to show my dominance in the relationship.  First thing I did was stop asking her what she wanted for dinner.  I would cook what ever the fuck I wanted.  I use this as an way to make things more adventurous in our life by finding and cooking new foreign dishes that we have never tried.  I also made the decision one day to throw out all shitty junk food for both my wife and I and our baby.  I told her she wasn't allowed crappy food in out house any more.  I also decided we would not be giving our baby any of the sugar/preservative filled crap food.  I make all her meals from scratch and know that she is eating the healthiest meals she can.

If the man is not getting sex in marriage, the way to get it is by self improvement as a man- and in particular by cultivating other sexual options with younger, hotter types.  You can only satisfy a woman's hypergamy by being the best option she can get.  You can only be the best option she can get by showing her that you have other options but choose to stay with her- for now so long as she is behaving...."

(coincidentally, the guy who wrote NMMNG is an LMFT)  We believe in systemic interactions and renounce a linear causal effect chain.  I have seen a variety of couples in which each blames the other for their reactions.  ""I nag because he with withdraws, I withdraw because he nags.""  ""I don't have sex because he is not close to me, I am not close to her because she does not have sex with me"".  Instead of blaming either individual, as the cause cannot ever be fully found out, I focus on the interaction between the individual. Not why is this happened, but what is happening.  What is so interesting about this is that we move away from libido problems, women frigidity, ego issues, unresolved childhood conflicts to a focus on interactional dynamics.  This particular one, and the one most individuals on /r/deadboodrooms are involved in is called ""pursue/withdraw"".  And what I have found that is so awesome is that all of the tips and tricks on TRP are some of the same, albeit worded differently, interventions that I use to break up the pattern of the husband pursuing for sex.  Which is to do something different which is basically to withdraw.  It take some wordplay to sell it to the male, but if you can do it result usually follow.

Monogamy is an agreement to sexual exclusivity, in exchange for reasonable access.   If you expect monogamy from your partner, then yes, you are obligated to sex.

My father lives a sexless hell on Earth and has no idea how to deal with the dominant, frigid, unpleasant harpy known as his wife so let me vent my anger on his behalf and on behalf of the vast majority of married men in todays society.    Marriage is an agreement, a contract, a quid-pro-quo, and women have not been fulfilling their end of the contract beginning in the 1960's.  Since men lost the right to spank a disobedient and unpleasant wife like the bratty little girl she is, and marital ""rape"" statutes were repealed, and ""No Fault"" Divorce laws, the 'tender years doctrine, feminist courts, and complete female supremacy in the family, every year has seen increasing feminization of the culture, strengthening of woman, and total kneecapping of men.  I am sick and tired of the bullshit.  All that said, I also used the word ""Man"" very deliberately.  A MAN is entitled to sex from his wife (or he can go get it elsewhere).  Bluepill manginas are entitled to the hand.  Marriage is about SEX.  Marriage is about fucking your wife and husband.  If you are not doing that, you are not married in any sense of the word.  If you are a man supporting his wife and is getting constant Shit Tests and unpleasant behavior (and no sex) then you are not married.  You are a slave and your mistress is treating you with contempt and cruelty.  A slave is justified in using any means to escape his bondage and frankly, our suggestions on MRP are weak broth.  The SJW's and women in general are not going to like the masculine backlash that is coming if we don't get on top of this problem soon.  The problem with trying to ignore them is that TBP does exist and they represent the dominant feminist culture of complete female entitlement and complete male capitulation.  They don't even try to hide it because they are proud of their victory even while failing to understand it as the source of that constant itching sensation in their bone dry vaginas."

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for levelling the playing field and right now men are getting a raw deal, but a system where men basically did something worse, that's not my idea of a just society.

I don't know the exact but story, but if his mother fucked up his family by threatening to take the kids away if his father didn't dance to her tune, there are rightful targets for that rage: her, and the politicians and police officers who give her that power. In a just world, such people would be punished harshly - democracy and laws don't justify anything in my book and they should be treated exactly like a criminal who extorted him by threatening to kidnap his kids.

Until they bring value into my life, I would prefer if we ghosted them, like you said. BPP prefers to have them there as an enemy, which can be a good thing... nothing like a shitty boss to create group cohesion in subordinates.  He's just picked his mountain to die on, kind of the reverse of the son in NMMNG, where instead of an abusive, alpha father that he wasn't going to emulate, he has (his words) a BP neutered one, and he isn't going to emulate that.  And maybe it's just because I was smart enough to never get married (7 year LTR, common-law, childfree) but other than the idea of losing cash if she decided to go nuclear, I'm fine with operation scorched earth.

But back when there was no such thing as marital rape, I can't imagine that there weren't husbands who raped their wives. And divorce was difficult at best, and life outside marriage  was deliberately made very hard for women.  It was organized violent oppression. As unjust as the current system is, the old version was worse. Politicians should gtfo of our personal lives. A fair, voluntary system: if two people want to live together and agree on how to split finances or pay alimony in case they divorce, they make a contract. If there is no contract each just take what is theirs and walk away. No laws are needed."

NOTHING!   This is both the base of my unplugging and the thing that makes my anger resurface the most. Women aren't even trying to hide it anymore, they will outright say this is the deal (demanding each side of the coin separately) short of directly saying they don't owe their boyfriends and husbands anything for what They want. And their men agree to it!  This is especially apparent in the community I am apart of. There's a lot of talk about women that ride the CC and the wall forces them to opt for a BB/meal ticket situation... They will at least embrace some kind of whorish sex for someone and theres a lot less hamstering about what they're doing. At least they put out, or know how to do it well to some degree if they want to. This is why I laugh at anyone thinking they can opt for a conservative/religious girl and avoid the worst parts of hypergamy. If anything, these ones can be worse because they treat their pussies as free passes to demand everything you mentioned regardless of how poor and infrequent the sex is. Some of them will be so fucked as to demand no porn and no jerking off AND THEN have the nerve to only toss their husband a bone once a month.

As if I followed any of the nonsense they speak about.  I know my wife spent years thinking she had eternal commitment NO MATTER WHAT. She didnt worry about whether I was pleased because she didnt have to. Spent my money frivolosuly, invited her family to stay with us whenever she wanted, lied, cheated, gave starfish sex etc etc.  Why shouldnt she? I certainly wasnt telling her what to do. I whined about it sure...but that barely registered.  Cant really blame her, she had nothing to lose, and nothing to work for.  So I came to my sense and started ""abusing"" her.   Here is how I did it:  I dropped 25 poinds and wear the same jeans and bench the same weight I did as a high school football player.  I wear great clothes and take pride in how I look.  I stopped worrying about her wants and needs took care of my own.  I let her bad moods amplify my good ones.  Ramped up time playing sports, coaching kids sports etc.  Socialize regularly with old and new friends.  No longer ask for sex from her, I take it. Then use her for my pleasure and tell her I own that pussy. (Surprise..she loves it)  Stopped.making her comfortable that I wouldn't leave her or cheat on her. I used to run to make her envy disappear.  So in the end I became an abusive, controlling asshole. I had the gall to control how much of my life I was willing to give to a woman who didn't appreciate it.   I cant say what happens next. I can say my marriage works well and the whole family is very happy. All of it is because I started abusing the wife"

I could call my wife ""low libido"" and she would even agree, and I would have fit right in. But that would be the end of the story. I can't fix her. If I'm the problem though, well I can fix me."

I had a rough night sleep (alone) as she decided to go to the guest bedroom.  I thought a lot about us, and I questioned myself a bit.  But the longer I thought about it the more I realized she was expecting me to deal with her bullshit emotions, rather than dealing with them herself.  I'm a little unclear on one thing here: How am I a resource for my wife around her emotional upset?  She's not a vulnerable person, she's very guarded and closed off around her vulnerabilities.  I get the oak metaphor, but I don't think she'll ever be able to come around.  I don't want a divorce, so I guess I have some outcome dependence.  As for sexy time?

I will explain to you the kind of frame of mind that you need to have to be able to say that you are Outcome independent.   You have to be able to see yourself being happy outside of your marriage as a single dude! Your commitment to the relationship is your only leverage. It do not have to be your first choice but it is a choice that is available to you.    How am I a resource for my wife around her emotional upset?   Your not! Her emotion, her bullshit, her problem.   I have been with a women like that for a very long time but it all changed when I decided to stop being all nice and attentive to her problem. You are focusing way too much on her and not enough on you. I know this will sound counter intuitive but the less you care about her emotional tantrum, and the less you try to appease her the better she will behave.

This is where all other things stem from.   Improve my IDGAF. I still feel butt hurt when my wife is unfair or unreasonable. I don't act like it as much anymore, but I need to internalize AWALT to the extent that I do not resent her for acting like a woman.

marriedredpill,3d6hvm,RPAlternate42,5,Tue Jul 14 15:11:05 2015 UTC,"8 months in and you are still deluding yourself into thinking you genuinely don't care about certain things:   she stops and checks to see if one of our kids is awake (which is the exact fucking type of behavior that I hate).   And then...   No biggie, I had fun anyway. I was genuinely OI.   No you weren't OI.  You like to say you were because you didn't care about the sex being over but the sex being over was a result of her leaving to check on the kid which I'm sure has everything to do with    the fact that she was ignoring [you] in favor of our new baby.   Three years ago and her doing that made you think about the reasons she dismissed you as a husband three years ago and made you cheat.  To play arm-chair therapist: I think you are still mad at her for not owning to her being a sexless shrew who made you feel like less of a man.  The problem with that line of thinking is that you were less of a man... that's why she didn't want to have sex with you.  Women are fluids that fill the container you provide and you were a sieve.  While you may have had OI for the sex being over... it's a cover up for the ill-feeling you still harbor for a specific kind of behavior and you stopped the BJ as a punishment, of sorts, for doing the fucking type of behavior that [you] hate.  RedPill does not examine and judge a woman for her actions; you cannot control her or what she does.  You can only control you.  You cannot stay mad at a woman for treating you the way you deserved to be treated three years ago by dread-gaming her for not letting her finish a blow job.  SMH... She came back with the intention of having her mouth filled with you to make you happy and your attitude was , ""meh... the momentum's over.""  Stoicism 101:   If you are unhappy it is your fault Accept what cannot be changed Refuse to consider yourself the victim Maximise positive emotions and minimize negative emotions   After you figure out what you are still really mad about... figure out why you can't continue a blow job after a short amount of time.  My bet is the former will fix the latter."
marriedredpill,3d6hvm,BluepillProfessor,2,Tue Jul 14 03:18:17 2015 UTC,"You, jackten, and BPP have uncovered some serious blind spots.  Thanks for taking the time.   8 months in and you are still deluding yourself   Wow.  I didn't see this dissonance.  Thanks for bringing that to my attention.  Her stopping to check on the kid did trigger my memory of 3 years ago, and I'm not ok with being so easily triggerable.   it's a cover up for the ill-feeling you still harbor for a specific kind of behavior and you stopped the BJ as a punishment, of sorts, for doing the fucking type of behavior that [you] hate.   You're right.  I'm still hung up on the past, which means I haven't owned my shit.  This mess is my fault.  She made her decisions, but I made mine, and I need to own the consequences.  The buck stops here, so to speak.  I'm mad that my life has turned out this way, that I was so desperate for a girlfriend but too ""religious"" to use birth control, that we had a kid, that we got married, that we stuck it out.  And all that is a cover for being mad at myself, for swallowing the BP mentality so completely.  As much as I want to blame everyone else for my ignorance, I cannot.  This resonates strongly with me.  Last night I was laying in bed, and I realized how much anger is simmering just below the surface.  I am not happy.  I am not motivated.  I am going through the motions, blindly following whatever advice sounds good, hoping that faking it will eventually turn into making it.  I don't even know what I realistically need.  I would love a month of hermit living in the mountains to sort all this out..."
marriedredpill,3d6hvm,stonepimpletilists,4,Tue Jul 14 15:51:15 2015 UTC,"It finally took me some courage after I swallowed the pill last October to help her understand her contribution to the affair.   Why are you spending time trying to make HER accept some contribution for YOUR behavior?  (Scratches Head).   I tell her she lost me and lets go to bed. No biggie, I had fun anyway. I was genuinely OI. This zaps her little hamster wheel and the poor thing can’t even keep up. She starts freaking out and worrying that she didn’t satisfy me and that I’ll go cheat on her in the morning. Kept repeating the question “Am I the best you’ve ever had?”    This would have been fine if you just put a finger on her lips and tell her something like:  ""You are all that I want right now baby.""  DO NOT discuss this with your wife.   I should never have told her flat out “I cheated because we weren’t having sex.” She then added “sex” to her weekly checklist. I don’t want duty sex, I want genuine desire.   Maybe, but now that you are having sex, the best way to spark desire is to keep having sex.  DO NOT listen to what she is telling you.  When a girl is on the rag and giving a BJ, that is not the time to ask her if she is really hot for you or just fucking you for mate retention.  In fact, there is no time good for that discussion.   Smaller and smaller things are overwhelming her,   This is a woman really worried about her marriage.  You need to take charge.  Provide reassurance, get a membership at the gym, and take her with you- and fuck her good.  Stopping during sex is very high level dread and is recommended for a sexually withdrawing, begrudging starfish wife- NOT a wife who is trying.  Also, you need to study seduction and work on turning on your wife more.  However, much of the time a quick fuck will make everybody happy.  Think of getting a BJ as like getting a backrub.  It is not really a top notch experience for the giver but it is nice enough.  Why overthink it?"

I was tired of being in the doghouse.  I decided to explain it to her so she would understand the true situation.  I never blamed her, just described my perspective.  Maybe that was still wrong?  It is what it is now.   When a girl is on the rag and giving a BJ, that is not the time to ask her if she is really hot for you or just fucking you for mate retention. In fact, there is no time good for that discussion.   I didn't ask, this was all her.  I was honestly just enjoying the ride when she lost it.  She offered the info about her feeling obligated.  Going off what jackten said, it seems she is fucking me for mate retention and I need to up our SMVs for it to become more genuine.  Or should I just accept that wives fuck their husbands first for mate retention and only second for desire?  I have this ideal situation in mind where she can't keep her hands off me...   Stopping during sex is very high level dread and is recommended for a sexually withdrawing, begrudging starfish wife- NOT a wife who is trying.   You're right, this was definitely a mistake.  I should have at least tried to get going again, even if I didn't have an orgasm.   Why overthink it?   I definitely didn't.  Most of my problem with this situation is reactionary to her freaking out that I was ok with not finishing.  In reflecting, I know I didn't stay in my frame because I reacted to her.  If I had ramped the comfort up to 11, I don't think it would have become such a huge issue.  But I do need to practice gaming her more.  There's just so much to work on, its a bit overwhelming.  I'm considering a pseudo-monk mode so I can get my life figured out before I tackle relationship stuff.  There's something to be said for not biting off too much at once."

marriedredpill,3d6hvm,teeay,6,Tue Jul 14 15:52:44 2015 UTC,"Cheating increases Dread without a corresponding increase in SMV.  I believe this is the root of your problem.  Your previous posts have indicated you're still struggling accomplishing a lot of goals in your life outside of your marriage.  Besides some enhanced muscle definition from going to the gym more often, and I'm sure you bought a few new articles of clothing, but are you a materially better man than you were a year ago?  Or to ask this another way: Have you objectively increased your value since swallowing the Red Pill?  The answer, in my opinion, is ""not really.""  You're wife is feeling something like Dread Level 8, but your SMV is a 6.  Enough for your wife to be terrified you'll continue to cheat on her again, but not enough for her to accept this as a possible outcome if she doesn't keep her high-value man happy.  A few years ago, I was watching the Sopranos with my wife on DVD.  After one of those episodes that highlighted the anguish Carmela feels because she has to look the other way when it comes to Tony's comares, my wife said to me: ""I don't worry about you cheating on me.  I do sometimes wonder if you'll ever tell me you're just going to start seeing other women, because I think I'd basically just have to accept it.""    It sort of caught me out of the blue, but I thought about it later.  My wife has it pretty damn good, she knows it, and she does her best to keep it that way.  She also knows it's possible that, despite her doing her best, my value is high enough that her best may not be good enough for my fidelity.    This is the headspace where you need to get your wife.  Acceptance.  She's married to a high value male.  She's doing everything she can to make him happy.  Will he cheat?  Hopefully not.  Can she do anything about it?  Well, she's already doing all the things she knows will make him happy.  So why agonize over this?     The answer to all of this is to lead my family, take charge of our diet, make sure the schedule allows time for her workouts, and become more attractive to increase the attraction.    This is only part of the answer.  Like I said, you've got a marriage at Dread level 8, but your SMV is 6 and your wife is probably something like 4-5.  What you're suggesting is investing your time and effort into getting her SMV to 6.  If she drops thirty pounds, she may feel better about herself and less freaked out about you having another affair.  But that will be because she'll feel better about her odds finding someone better in the inevitable divorce that would happen if you cheated again.  Acceptance of this idea will probably not manifest as her getting dripping wet to fuck her SMV 6 husband.  To clarify: I'm not suggesting you should want her to remain a fatass.  But if she increases her SMV and you don't, that will reduce the Dread (given there will no longer be an SMV disparity), but she'll just go from feeling like she has to fuck you out of obligation, to not feeling that way anymore.  She'll nag you less.  She'll also fuck you less.   It’s a tad difficult to have to take care of her. I’m just now getting used to taking care of myself.   Had you not cheated, you could have organically increased your SMV, and had a much less confrontational evolution of your marriage than what you're experiencing now.  When a guy like /u/mrpCamper hits the gym and drops some extra weight, his marriage goes from something like Dread Level 1 to 3.  Enough to get his wife's attention, but not anything that's going to cause her hamster to freak out and go nuts with the Shit/Comfort Tests.  Unfortunately, you don't have that luxury.  So yeah.  Your cheating just turned up the difficulty level in your marriage from ""Hard"" to ""Ultraviolence.""  The bigger the gap in the SMV between you and your wife, the more she'll freak out because you're in a marriage that has very little tolerance for additional Dread caused by SMV disparities.  But if you help her increase her SMV at the expense of your own, then she won't even give you the duty sex you're somewhat bored with.  So you pretty much need to thread the needle here.  Help her increase her SMV enough so she stops freaking out about you cheating, but increase your own SMV so that she replaces that obligation to fuck you, with an actual desire to fuck you."
marriedredpill,3d6hvm,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:01:11 2015 UTC,"As always, you're right on most points.  Thanks for taking the time to reply.  You uncovered some of my blind spots.   She also knows it's possible that, despite her doing her best, my value is high enough that her best may not be good enough for my fidelity.   This seems like a raw deal for her, but that's the risk she's willing to take because you're so high value.  Am I understanding that correctly?   Well, she's already doing all the things she knows will make him happy.   There's a bit of dissonance here.  When she was ignoring me, I sent very loud signals, and she still ignored them.  Now, she's afraid I'm still sending signals and she's just not getting them, in spite of her giving more sex.  She's afraid I'm lying about my satisfaction.  I don't blame her I suppose.  I lied alot.  Maybe I've overestimated our SMV gap.  Actually, maybe I just overestimated my SMV.  I figured I was higher because she regularly wonders why someone good looking like me would settle for someone plain like her.  Maybe that's just her insecurity talking.  I dunno.  Either way, I do need to up my SMV.  I've dropped a couple weekly things I was doing for myself.   So you pretty much need to thread the needle here.   Not going to lie, that is the most discouraging thing I've read on this site.  I came into this marriage pretty messed up from my upbringing: lazy, undisciplined, lacking vision, manipulative, narcissistic.  I was neither alpha fucks nor beta provider.  No wonder she ignored me.  It just seems like such an uphill battle, developing traits that I've never worked on before.  All while maintaining peace and happiness in my home.  All for a marriage that probably will never function at 100% again.  Yay.  Pity party over  I need to make a decision.

Absolutely goddamn hysterical.    She'd have full-blown meltdown.  Alternate between hating you and blaming herself.  She'd call her parents.  Maybe her parents would even call you.  Then you'd have to start making all sorts of awkward decisions, starting that same night.  Are you two really going to sleep in the same bed after you just dropped the D-bomb on her?  You'll cave.  I guarantee you'll cave.  You'll feel so shitty about everything and how bad you're making your wife feel and witness your kids being ripped apart first-hand.  And all you'll have to do is say: okay, let's not get divorced, and this will all get fixed.  Well, sort of.  Except like your affairs, the damage will have been done.  Your wife is operating with an anxiety level that's permanently affixed on Dread Level 8.  Now she'll be operating at Dread Level... 10?  11?  It'll just be nuts.  She'll be even more terrified of cheating and/or divorce, because you've cheated and you've tried to get divorced.  And you'll come back to MRP, talking about how you've gone off half-cocked on yet another thing in your life, and how you seem to be paying the price for it, over and over again.   I don't know for sure that I can make it in this marriage, but I can't fathom leaving my kids.   Now, even though I said all the above would be discouraging, it doesn't have to be.  Because you did not actually do this yet.  I was just outlining how I could very easily see this sequence of events happening in your life, and I am urging you to not let that happen.    Yes, ""threading the needle"" is hard.  But knowing you, this is absolutely something you must commit too.  Because if it fails... at least you'll have the mental fortitude to follow through on the next natural step, which is divorce.  Because, for perhaps one of the few times in your life, you'll be able to say to yourself, ""Well, I fucked up, but I really did do everything I could to fix it.  It just wasn't good enough.  So it goes.""    You will know, with 100% certainty, your marriage has way too much ""scar tissue"" to ever heal in the way you (and your wife, if she's honest with herself) want.  Which means you can deal with the short-term pain everyone will feel with a divorce, because you're completely confident it's in everyone's best interests and the only way you can your wife will ever be happy long-term.     I need to make a decision.    No, you don't.  That was really the whole point of my ""imagine suggesting divorce"" mental exercise.  Thread the needle.  That is the only decision you can make right now.    It will extremely hard, and it will be easy to get discouraged and pity yourself for the bad decisions you made in cheating on your wife, and how that's set your seemingly impossible situation now.  And even if you do shut those thoughts out of your mind, you may very well fail at it.  The only way you'll truly be happy in your marriage is if your SMV improves enough to be the kind of man you want to be, while you lead your family and give your wife the structure and support she needs to be the kind of woman she wants to be/wife you want her to be.  That is a herculean task.  But it's may not be impossible.  It's only in truly attempting that task, that you will know for sure whether it's actually possible or not.  Personally, I do think it's possible.  When you deconstruct the macro steps needed to make this happen, it pretty much is a list that includes something like:   You continue to improve on acting like a more responsible and achievement-oriented man. You accomplish some major macro goals in your life, such as advancing in your career. You provide a family structure that enables success for everyone, not just yourself.  It's up to your wife to decide whether she wants to succeed or not.     That's it.  That's the list.  That's all what ""threading the needle"" really looks like.  Can you do it?  That's up to you.  At least in failure, you'll know you did everything you can, and can take the next steps accordingly.  It's not that easy, but it is that simple."

Its exactly spot on.   I bet you couldn't get divorced now even if you tried.   Knee jerk reaction: Nuh-uh!  I've seen a divorce lawyer, I'm ready to do it!  But then I read your little scenario, and yup, that sounds about right.  It would be too hard for me to walk away.  I'm not confident enough that its the best option because I don't really want to leave my kids.   Now, even though I said all the above would be discouraging, it doesn't have to be.

I'm also assuming I shouldn't necessarily verbally include her in this.  She's no unicorn, but she's a pretty good woman who was raised by a dictatorially strict RP dad.  I trust that if I do what I need to do, she'll follow without me having to tell her what's up."
marriedredpill,3d6hvm,stonepimpletilists,3,Tue Jul 14 22:15:23 2015 UTC,"Honest question, where do you get all of this? Its exactly spot on.   One of the upsides to getting older is that you realize you've seen all this shit before.  It's not just AWALT.  It's really APALT.  When it comes to macro life decisions, there are only so many mental models people have.  Also, I personally had some overlap with some of your mental models.  Same self-destructive/half-cocked tendencies that took a lot of introspection and some individual therapy to sort out.  Plus, you've been on MRP for awhile.  You may not feel like you've shared a lot of your life, and objectively speaking, you haven't.  But you've shared more than the usual ""wife is a bitch, is this a Shit Test?"" posts we see here.  You'll notice I usually save my long comments for guys whose posts I've been following for awhile, and who give enough context for me to give more specific advice than just ""lift/sidebar/STFU.""   Thanks for this. At least I'm not completely screwed.   Fuck, man!  You're not screwed at all.    There's a little voice in your head that loves to say shit like: ""This is really hard.  And it's only this hard because you fucked up.  Imagine if you didn't fuck up.  Wouldn't this be a lot easier?  You could probably just blow everything up and start over.  I bet that'd be easier.  You should do that.""  There's nothing wrong to listening to that voice, per se.  But ""blowing shit up,"" in whatever way that may be, has its own costs.  And you absolutely must have thought through the next step, the ""starting over"" part.  Let's take your professional life.  Say your boss gives you a bad review.  There's that voice again.  Now you have to exceed your performance just to climb out of your boss's doghouse just so his opinion of you is ""neutral/competent,"" and then continue to exceed your performance to actually advance professionally.    There's that voice again.  ""This is really hard.  And it's only this hard because you fucked up.  Imagine if you didn't fuck up...""  Everyone with ""self-destructive tendencies"" has this problem.  Setbacks are assumed to be too much work to overcome.  Starting over seems more appealing.  But if you don't have the discipline to overcome a setback, you probably won't have the discipline to start over effectively.  You may not even have enough discipline to thoroughly blow things up!  You'll start to ""blow things up,"" but then stop halfway through, like in my hypothetical situation where you try and divorce your wife, but then call it off.  Great, all you really did was dig yourself in a deeper hole.  Or you'll ""blow things up"" before you're ready to, and then always wonder if that was the right decision, preventing you from ""starting over"" effectively.  This crossroads is where you are now.  Because then you'll fuck up ""starting over"" and wonder if you should have just stuck with the pre-""blown things up"" situation.  Let's say you actually do divorce your wife at this point, somehow white-knuckle through all the emotional anguish.  You move out, establish custody, etc.  Well.  You're a ""free"" man!  Time to put yourself out there and start dating again!  After you get your dick sufficiently wet (hopefully this time with better looking women than fat chicks off Craigslist), you'll eventually get into an LTR.  I'm sure you can imagine yourself dating a woman who doesn't have your wife's negative qualities, but is missing a lot of her positive traits too.  You start arguing because you work a lot and she never cooks dinner, whereas your wife took personal pride in always making sure your family was fed.  Also, she has no interest in being a stepmother, and acts generally shitty to your kids.  That sort of thing.  Suddenly, there's that voice again.  ""This is really hard.  And it's only this hard because you fucked up and divorced a woman that was your wife and mother of your children.  Imagine if you didn't fuck up...""    What inspired me to write all this shit to you was your earlier comment here.   Pity party over I need to make a decision.    No.  There is no decision to make.  For someone like you, you have to commit to trying to thread the needle, and follow through.  That's the only way you'll be able to conclude whether divorce should be the next step.  This is the only way where you actually ""blow things up"" and then ""start over"" and don't spend countless moments dealing with self-doubt that leads to a vicious negative cycle.   I'm assuming I shouldn't put a timeline to this. Say, in the next year, or three, or five, if we haven't made progress, I'll call it quits.    Set a timeline to evaluate.  That's what I do.  Your introspection should be scheduled, calculated, and deliberate.  Allowing self-doubt to cloud your thoughts is not ""introspection.""  That's just your broken mental model trying to fuck you up again.    I like three and six month timelines for evaluation.  So commit to a course of action, and note you'll evaluate in three or six months.  If it doesn't seem like it's working at first, well, too bad.  Remain stoic and stay the course.  Then at 3/6 months, take some time for yourself and do some real introspection.  If you're still agonizing over the decision, then commit to another 3/6 months.     Or is it one of those things I'll just ""know"" one day?   When you think to yourself, ""this isn't working,"" it should be a loud and unambiguous message.  Thoughts like ""I can't tell if this is working, maybe it's not, but maybe it still could, and I'd hate to leave my kids..."" are not unambiguous.  Those are thoughts that indicate you need more time to conclude your next step.   She's no unicorn, but she's a pretty good woman who was raised by a dictatorially strict RP dad. I trust that if I do what I need to do, she'll follow without me having to tell her what's up.   Your previous posts have indicated as much.  Look, if you get your own shit together professionally/personally, I really do think she'll follow your lead too.  I have to think you feel this way too, otherwise you would have long since thrown in the towel.  You don't need to be a ""dictatorially strict RP dad,"" but you do need to basically drop some of your man-child tendencies (e.g. doing poor work at your job because you're unmotivated, waiting weeks before dealing with your bug infestation, etc).  Your wife is literally and overtly thirsting for you to provide the kind of leadership her father probably used to.  And you can't call the goddamn exterminator or come into work on time?  Come on, dude.  You're better than that, and I know you know that.  With the right approach, you can end up in a virtuous cycle.  Dropping the man-child tendencies can lead to improving your SMV (eg. your career advances once you stop receiving demerits for coming into work late) and also be ""oak moves"" for your family (career advancement = better standard of living).  Once you present yourself as a man who has his shit together and knows what it takes to accomplish and achieve goals, your wife will happily follow your example, especially if you can give her the structure to succeed.  You're annoyed she's disorganized and undisciplined, but are you exactly a model of organization and discipline?      So to wrap it up: Thread the needle, and probably start by dropping the man-child tendencies.  Set a timeline to evaluate.  Shut down any thoughts of self-doubt in between now and then.  I don't know if you'll succeed, but I wouldn't be writing these walls of texts if I didn't think it was possible.    Now, my opinion is relatively worthless, since I don't really know you.  Although since I've written this much mostly based on what I've recognized in myself among the stuff you've written... perhaps I do.  Best of luck."

Quick question, I don't know if you noted if or not in your piece so I'd like to ask you if you have any insight. My wife works in the medical field, and is surrounded by other female employees almost exclusively. She claims that she essentially removes herself from the social circle, feeling that she doesn't want to participate in ""gossip"" or share personal details. Even her own circle of friends is rather small. Is this because she, and others like her, are not as well equipped to handle the FSM as others? Is she not a carrier of certain criteria that would allows her higher social dominance and so that is why they would withdraw from the group, or not be an active participant?"
marriedredpill,3d7xh9,merodiaj,13,Tue Jul 14 05:21:45 2015 UTC,"The Pact  /u/RedPillForever made the following statement earlier, which I think is one of those golden quotes that everyone should know:   Monogamy is an agreement to sexual exclusivity, in exchange for reasonable access.   Your wife is giving you access and your agreement was sexual exclusivity; that is, she lets you have sex with her and you don't have sex anywhere else.  The same agreement is on you.  You violated the pact.  You took her access and spurned the exclusivity.  I won't offer opinion on this.  What I have stated above is a matter of facts.  The Aftermath  On the other side of things, you are apparently valuable enough to her that she is shrugging it off.  I don't what her motivation is, but she may see things in the following ways:   I can cheat on him now so we are even Of course he slept with other women... he's a masculine strong man I hope he isn't going to leave me for the other woman If he thinks he's getting sex after this he'll have to prove himself to me.   I'm sure others can add to this list.  Number 1  This is AWALT.  Always be on the lookout.  Granted, she's right, you would be even if she slept with another dude.  If she is fixated on the logistics of being even, she will tell you first.  If she is fixated on satisfying her own anger, she won't until after.  Either way, if you believe what you did was wrong, communicated that correctly to her, and set that as a boundary for yourself that you shouldn't have crossed, then you need to ensure that such a boundary for her exists as well.  You may think, I can't really tell her what to do after that... but you can.  If she is high-value and honorable, then the rule doesn't affect her because she won't violate the pact.  If she finds a problem with the rule then know that AWALT in this situation even if you think she is just pushing back as a shit test.  Number 2   This is unlikely.  I don't think you are Chad enough for that... but she seems to shrug it off like it's nothing.  A woman will do anything for the right man.  Number 3  This is the most likely the thing she is really thinking.  Cheating makes the hamster run wild.  The biggest fear women have about their man in their relationship is packing up and delivering resources to another woman instead of her.  This is the basis for dread game; we are doing all the things that make women think we are cheating or going to cheat so they get their shit together.  This is why we have levels.  You went to level 11 with no provocation when you should have been at level 3 to 6 in various forms.    Opinion: 1I think all marriages should be at least a level 4, but nor more than 6, as long as the sex is regular and good.  Number 4  This is possible and more so if you are new to RP or were really beta for a long time.  If she sees you as a beta faking it as an alpha, then she will drag the shit out of you back to beta land.  If she is genuinely respectful of you as a man, this outcome isn't as likely.  You have found MMSLP in 2013... but I don't know how long you've been properly RP.  MMSLP tends to be the gateway for new guys... but the discovery of the door can take a while.  Your Position Now  This is a matter of my opinion.   Apologize: Tell her you are sorry for what you did and that it won't happen again.  Tell her you crossed a boundary that isn't permissible for either of you.  Don't go overboard with this; no need to be a supplicating child about it.  You made a mistake, you apologized, you made awareness of the boundary, and you promised not to cross it again. Go Abut Your Married Life: Know that you are better for the transgression because you learned something about yourself.  Don't allow yourself to be in positions that chip at the weak spots in your personal honor code. Fuck your wife like she's every other slut you want to fuck.   Do I really have to endure this struggle for another 10, 20 years?  No.  You Don't.  But know that that option, should you choose to maintain a monogamous relationship with your wife, it will involve a divorce.  Should you decree monogamy as defined above as rubbish, you can make a play for an open relationship.  I can't offer any advice on this.  What I can offer is personal anecdote:  3 years married I was in an exceedingly shitty place, mentally.  I was out of the Corps, no real job, plodding through college at the JC.  I went on a backpacking trip with some other classmates... one of which was a particularly ripe little piece of ass.  We shared a tent, I touched her boob.  That was it.  I was 99% ready to stick my dick in her.  The 1% kept me from doing it.  She knew I was married and she still didn't care (AWALT.)  she had a boyfriend, whom I had met, and she didn't care (AWALT.)    At that time I was particularly alpha in my attitudes, actions, and dealings.  I talked with her (this was before texting was a big thing yet) and even went to the movies with her and her BF and my wife.  My wife was jealous as shit... threw shit test after shit test about it.  I knocked them away back then (what happened tot hat guy?) but decided I shouldn't really hang around this girl anymore because I was going to end up fucking her 6 ways to tomorrow and my wife still would have stayed with me.  But that violated my personal honor code.  Because I knew that sex with my wife was the only sex I will be having as long as we were having sex.  I know that I won't be having sex with anyone else as long as The Pact is in place, and to make up for that... I fuck my wife how I want; the Uber passenger I picked up that was out for a GNO with her friend and beta orbiter who kept trying to get me to hang out with her... fucked my wife like I would have her.  The girl at Target that kept following me around... The wife got the good end of that interaction.  You get the picture.  Fuck your wife like a dirty slut and she will love you more for it."

In the past I have often said no to girls who would try to hit on me. This was my first failure.  I think number (3) is her prevailing emotion, but because it was a drunken ONS on my part, there is no risk at all in this regard. I did not even seek it out: the girl came onto me heavily and - after rejecting her twice - I went to her place.  Since finding out about my ONS, she has been putting in extra effort to 'keep me', including more and kinkier sex, and she wants us to get started ASAP on kids.  I am not concerned about her cheating: I have offered an open relationship, but she has always shot it down, saying she does not want anybody else.   As a compromise, we have had a threesome with a girl before.  This was after I cheated, but before I confessed. It's fun, but the novelty quickly wears off and I don't think threesomes are the answer to my problem."

I'm not 40+, I'm younger (which makes it more difficult, right?), and I'm in a monogamous relationship.  I tell myself that pussy is just not that important. It's nice to have this sexual tension with other women, for me it's the best part, so I can skip the sex and release all that energy with my long-term girlfriend.  Getting pussy is not what makes you a man. It's just a small part of your life, like 15%, including relationship with your wife. It's itchy sometimes, yes, but it's just insignificant. Concentrate on the rest: leading, building something, building yourself, inventing, investing, being a father and so on. If your wife is good, supportive and sexy, it's actually a pretty good deal.  And of course also this:   fucked my wife like I would have her"

If you cheat and tell your wife, it makes me wonder if you are trying to punish her?  Other people here will tell you not to cheat. I won't judge either way. Just don't admit anything. Don't rub her nose in it. Don't humiliate her. It will just go badly for you."

I married the first girl I slept with although she rode the CC before meeting me.   I was in the deadest of Deadbedrooms from the word go. I always thought what it would be like with other women. So I joined an online dating site and actively sought out pussy  Over about 5 years I had about 7 women. Sex so hot you could have made a porno out of it. Not one of them cared that I was married. I never lied to any one of them, they knew what it was about.  And you know what? Not one of them made me happy. Sex is one thing, happiness totally something else. I got away with it. Few people know of my escapades, many won't believe it.  The grass is not greener on the other side, I have been there and can tell you honestly.  I recommited myself to find a way of staying in my marriage and finding a way to live honourably. The problem was with me. I fucked up.

Aint happening.    What you really have here is a lack of Outcome Independence.  You're afraid of failure, in this case failure to sow your wild oats.  The only real difference between now (at 42) and when I was 30?  I have more experience and I use it to make informed decisions.  I got experience by making decisions and learning from them.  Sometimes I made good decisions based on bad information, and I was like ""welp that didn't work"", but they were my decisions and I owned them.  In the end you're young.  I had my first kid when I was 37, and I still feel like an active energetic Dad.  Your wife may be awesome, but she's no snowflake and replaceable.  If her price of admission is exclusivity cut her loose.  If you really want an open marriage tell your wife that's your price of admission.  In the end what ever happens own that decision.  It's yours and we can't make it for you.  Accept that things may go great, or they may fail miserably, but in the end you can change course and improve your life.

If you really want an open marriage tell your wife that's your price of admission.    This is where I end up too, but I feel guilty if I give her this lose-lose choice, compared to the status quo, which I promised to uphold when we married.  Once I make a decision, I will own it.

Make a decision and stick to it.  If you decide to reform and know your are easily tempted, then you need to remove yourself from those situations that temp you:  e.g.--no drinking with co-workers on business trips.  We all have urges. Some of us make stupid mistakes.  Live, learn, decide what kind of man you want to be and move on. Apologize contritely, let her know if wont happen again, and do not bring it up again.  I mean, no not directly discuss it, refer to it, or make illusions to it...even self-deprecating ones.  It is in the past--move forward.  Know your wife.  This may encourage her to cheat. It may encourage her to pay more attention to you. It may also involve a ""time out period"" where she doesn't want to have sex.  Don't let this go on too long.  Again, its a mistake, move on and improve yourself and your marriage."

Have you considered proposing that to your wife? I don't know how one would successfully do that but doing includes her in the decision to stick your dick in another woman and potentially brings an element of fun for her into it too.   I have other married friends that have done so successfully. Everyone is still happily married.   I cheated on my first wife and feel horrible about it because I broke a promise I made to her.   My second wife I haven't cheated on but have thought about it a lot because...I'm a man and I need sex. I did make the promise to myself that before it gets that far that I would at least bring the idea of a threesome with another woman to her.

Look, this will pass. If she's not into an open marriage, maybe there's a girl out there who is. Even if there isn't, you're 30, you got plenty of years to have fun and then find a girl to start a family with. You'll likely end up with a younger, higher SMV girl at the end of this.  If I was 30 and without kids and just found TRP, I'd take the heartbreak from leaving someone I love and go spin plates. This is a no brainer unless you're married to a unicorn.    PRE-EDIT (what I wrote when I thought you had kids):  I like eating lots of pizza, ice cream, Mars bars, candy, a couple of beers each night, and so on.  I just don't because it gets in the way of other things I want in life.  I had some really great sex in my youth. It's not something you really value afterwards. It's a bit like eating Ben & Jerry's, fucking delicious but not that big a deal afterwards.  I think if you went out and fucked hot girls you'd be riding a high for a while. But in a year or two, when you're trying to keep your nuclear family together and dealing with the fallout from your continued cheating, it won't seem to have been worth it.  Let me ask you this: don't think about future pussy. Just what you got when cheating, compared to the consequences from it in your marriage. Is that a good trade off? Are you happy you did that? Delaying gratification sucks, but very often it is the smart choice.  For some people an open marriage can work, but you're probably not so lucky it will be easy. It will be A LOT of hard work. It is better than cheating since there's not the same breach of trust, but you're going to have to deal with a ton of shit just for some pussy.  Could you get your wife into swinging or threesomes? Would that do it for you? There's some tips on it in Sex God Method. If she was part of it maybe it would be easier on your marriage.  If this is really what you want though, that's really what you want. But just make sure you're not going for some short term gratification that turns out to not be what you really wanted."

We have had threesomes with a girl (after I cheated; before she found out) and honestly, that scratches most of the itch. So maybe this is the solution.

I think the main issue is, I feel responsible to uphold my vows. She placed her trust in me and feel I can't betray that.   Seriously, that's BS. You have the right to change your mind, and going in to marriage everyone knows what the marriage statistics are and how trivial shit people sometimes divorce over. You even cheated already, that's breaking your vow too. In fact, that's probably the one vow that you're expected to keep - but the others, to have and to hold, till death do us part, nobody thinks they're actual vows. A few very religious people excepted.   I also agree that a year or two, the novelty of fucking girls would wear off.

Let's be rational here.  Imagine you divorced her. She's 28 years! That would be brutal. You might as well shoot her with a shotgun right in the womb.  However, you're high SMV. You should aim for: - A maîtresse, - Kids with wife 1, kids with wife 2, - Polygamy.  Just have kids with your wife, then start over or introduce a concubine or maîtresse.  Best for you, best for your wife.  Does that make you an absolute cunt for breaking the deal? Yes. Is being a cunt better than being perpetually unhappy? I'd say so.

marriedredpill,3d4pkc,itstartstoday123,6,Mon Jul 13 14:36:19 2015 UTC,"A newcomers best tool is STFU.  That's what you should have done.  As you get more used to it you can have a lot more fun with it, but STFU always works and is hard to fuck up (unless you open your mouth).  When in doubt, STFU.  My personal favorite (if the IOI was really blazen) is to play oblivious to the IOI and your wife's anger.  Your wife knows that you know exactly what she's talking about, but she can't exactly prove it and the more she pushes the point, the worse the conversation gets.  Throw in a little amused mastery when you've got her all worked up and then just walk away.  Wife:  ""Do you think she's cute?""  You: ""Who?"" (note the context, the who is completely obvious.  She knows it, you know it and you know she knows it)  Wife: ""The girl you where just talking to!""  You: Look over as if you've never seen her before ""Oh, I suppose she is pretty cute.""  Wife: Why would you say that!  You: ""Well she's got long legs and a short skirt and a nice face.""  Wife: ""Now you are just pissing me off.""  You: ""Why would you be mad?  I didn't even mention her tits""   Wife: ""Blah, blah, blah""  You: ""Sounds like that girl really gets your goat."" small smirk  ""Oh shoot my beer is getting low."" Walk off.  It's a social situation.  If you go talk to a hot girl, then your wife blows up and especially if she follows you around like a harpy, then she loses social standing.  Most women won't do it.  If your wife is either dumb enough, mad enough or disrespectful enough to do it, then it's really easy to turn a crowd against her."

marriedredpill,3d4pkc,Redneck001,3,Mon Jul 13 19:44:02 2015 UTC,You just took the pill and are already trying to do everything at once?  Shouldn't you be starting to lift and reading the side bar material?  I would guess there is a nuclear explosion on the horizon...
marriedredpill,3d4pkc,Redneck001,2,Mon Jul 13 16:54:30 2015 UTC,Trying to avoid it but yeah your right.  Don't sprint when you should be stretching. Don't use an tactical Nuke when a hand grenade will due.   I know six years is a short time to go through compared to some guys but it's hard when I still remember when I woke up everyday with her head between my legs.That's her potential and if I go to fast I will only set myself back from getting back there again.
marriedredpill,3d4pkc,Redneck001,10,Mon Jul 13 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"Too hot, too obvious, too in-your-face, too early in the process.  You don't need to rub her nose in it.  Once the Hamster is engaged, you need to shut it down and let it work on its own, not goad it over the edge.  Agreeing that the woman was attractive shows you're not a whipped beta who can't see the boobs in front of his face.  But after that, leave it alone.  The Hamster will work for you.  The better tactic for a married man to use here is Amused Mastery.  Yeah, she was hot.  Yeah, you would bang her.  Once you have effectively established that in your wife's mind, the ball is in her court.  Sit back and relax - half of the job is done for you.  All you have to do now is hold frame, be visibly amused by her obvious jealousy, and give her the opportunity to engage in some protective mate guarding sex to re-establish her sexual territory.  You lost your opportunity when she brought up the blonde.  That was an obvious invitation to initiate sex.  You could have reassured her that you found her far more attractive than the blonde and gotten some wholesome, lackluster married-people starfish sex out of it.  Or . . . you could have played her by initiating forcefully, and giving her an opportunity to prove her sexual power.  That's what she actually WANTED, and you blew that.    For example:  HER: I can't stop thinking about that blonde woman!  YOU: (adopting cocky arrogance and allowing your primal sexual attraction appear at the thought of her) Yeah, me, too!  HER: What did you mean by that?!  YOU: I've always wondered what you'd look like as a blonde.  I was thinking of buying you a wig.  Then it would be like cheating on you, only with you.  HER: You want to cheat on me?  OMG, this just gets worse!  YOU: I'm just wondering if you'd suck dick better as a blonde or a brunette.  They say that a woman's hair style and color affects the way she performs fellatio.  Just a curiosity.  HER: Who says that?  You are such a pervert!  YOU: And you married me.  You knew what you were getting, be honest.  Now, which do you think you would perform better as, a blonde or a brunette?  And they say red hair makes a woman particularly kinky when she's going down on you.  Adventurous.  Prone to sudden and uncontrollable fits of fellatio in the unlikliest of places.  Maybe if you went red and we went out of town, we could--  HER: You are such an ass!  YOU: And you are such a wonderful wife for agreeing to this exotic fellatio adventure!  Now come over here and let's establish a baseline . . . purely for scientific purposes.  Of course your mileage may vary, but that's one scenario in which you could have transformed her angry, defensive Hamster into a suddenly-sexually intrigued woman who has an opportunity to make you forget about a potential rival with a direct and kinky expression of her sexual power PLUS with the added bonus of being something that she can do with her HAIR.    That's what Amused Mastery can get you, if you master the technique."

I was and am still fighting beta urges so I am hesitant to go drinking without her because of obvious psycho reactions that I am not feeling like facing at this point.  I can practice my game outside of two drunk slutty girls with no regard other than there wet pussies.(I have alot of interaction with women in my job so I am very comfortable with beautiful women all the way down to feminazis with cement in their baby pipe) No intention of cheating and if I was I could bang her at work and save me a few dollars.

marriedredpill,3d4mr8,angels_fan,3,Mon Jul 13 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"Has it really been that long since you spoke to a girl?  It seems like you analyzed the shit out of a simple interaction. This is what MRP is looking to correct, Married Men who become fumbling fucks when women speak to them.  Cute girl talks to you, sweet Man, chat it up. No need to tell the wife, you just spoke to a girl, you didn't spend the whole game chatting or getting drinks together.  Seems weird to me that you tell your wife a girl spoke to you for 30 minutes instead of not telling her and just enjoying the game.  Going to the game alone will build some dread in her, telling her you interacted with a chick sounds like Look girls talk to me, aren't you jealous?!?!   On the Positive side you did Apply and gain experience and there is no substitute for that. Talk to girls, talk to guys, talk to people and interact with them and analyze the field and ensure you are implementing the TRP knowledge you've gained to ensure you're in control and directing where things are going or at least confidently adapting to the situation to be a guy other guys want to be like/around and girls want to sleep with.  In a 5 minute conversation an RP guy can make a BP guy's wife recognize what she's missing and wants in her life. I've had my wife's friends straight up tell me they wished their dude was more like me, in front of the guy. It comes from having a ridiculous amount of warranted and unwarranted amount of confidence in yourself and what you're saying/doing.  Don't think too much, just experience and take mental notes and adapt accordingly. Whether you text your wife about it or not is a personal decision I guess. You had her standing by when you got home so something is working."
marriedredpill,3d4mr8,TrainingTheBrain,3,Mon Jul 13 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"Or casually dropping a bit of the conversation a few days later, where the wife has to ask where/who you talked to is another solid strategy, as long as you're nonchalant and dismissive on the details, like it was no big deal."

I talk to girls plenty, and I wasn't a fumbling idiot with her.  Although I'm sure I did over analyze the fuck out of the situation.   No need to tell the wife   My main reason for telling her was for scientific purposes to test dread.  I was really curious to see how it would affect her."

marriedredpill,3d4mr8,IanIronwood,5,Mon Jul 13 15:33:33 2015 UTC,"Passive Dread always helps pull the trigger.  For bonus points you should have asked the girl to take a selfie with you to send to your wife.  All very innocent - but when she sees you relaxed and comfortable with a pretty girl, that initiates her mate guarding sexual reflex.  And yeah, the woman was likely flirting with you.  Sports wives are natural Alpha Widows, even though they married the Alpha.  There is an art to a married man flirting with a married woman in such a venue, a kind of joust that helps assure each party that they still have the skills to attract and select a worthy mate.  While this rarely leads to an  infidelity, it is also the prime way in which married women search for clandestine partners.    Of course most married men are completely clueless about this, as they are unaware of the contexts.  But if you realize what's going on, and that this is likely a friendly joust, not a serious duel, you can both use that to your advantage.  A ""harmless"" selfie, or a really GOOD hug to a pretty woman in a public venue can do wonders without crossing any lines with your wife.    But she has to know about it, or it won't create the necessary doubt her hamster needs to survive."

Are you married?  In an LTR?  Did you get married while the sex well was dry?"
marriedredpill,3d1kof,putsch80,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:59:42 2015 UTC,Going to get married in autumn. Somehow we started to refer to each other as wife and husband although we're still boyfriend and girlfriend. And I sticked to the term I'm used to while writing this paragraph.  Going to edit it to husband in spe to prevent further confusion.
marriedredpill,3d1kof,BluepillProfessor,6,Mon Jul 13 05:48:16 2015 UTC,"I was the drunk captain with a pissed first officer who's had to take command. This was the moment I took my first red pill, and I changed my life    Wait, are you me?   The first place I went was /r/deadbedrooms   Me too!  There really should be some type of regulation- and then I made the mistake of trusting religion and trying Catholic Answers.  The feminst Borg Collective couldn't ban me fast enough.   Most important was maybe that I understood, that she wasnt evil, but testing me and her relationship decisions, since I struggled with my new job at home.    AWALT is a jolting realization but it helps to cope sometimes.   A interesting fact is that her vaginal pain magically disappeared since I became the Oak.   They do that.  Magical illnesses are suddenly cured. Headaches and nausea.  If a girl wants to fuck you she will fuck you.  If she doesn't, that is also obvious.  I put passing Shit Tests at Level 1- even before MAP-ing, lifting weights, or building the plan (Level 2) for several reasons.  First, once you start passing Shit Tests, the entire dynamic changes- and for some guys that is all they need to do to restore the sex in your marriage/LTR.  I think this is especially true for Drunk Captains.  Also, it is ridiculously easy for some guys to begin immediately doing it right (vs. lifting that takes several months to show results).  For other guys it is harder but the important thing is to begin adjusting the pre-Shit Test awareness communication style and expectations."

Got emotionally and pissed easily.  After I started to identify the tests, I could  handle them with out drama: In my opinion the besting working response is to look at her,  raise one my eye brow and say something like seriously: ""seriously?"". Than carry on doing what you've been doing.  You're right it takes little effort and short time to change the direction of the relationship. The first time it noticed that this RP works was when I passed a shit test by agreeing and amplifying. So after that that I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. She followed me to grab my bum and give me a kiss in the neck. Oh boy at this point to I was really surprised."

She started to show more affection although she contained to criticize me in an inappropriate way. I continued to pass the test and gathered more information by reading some books. As I gained more understanding and changed my behavior the relationship improved. This lasted several weeks.  I personally believe that the hardest part was to decided how I wanted my life to be, what is important, what do I need in my personal life, what expectations do I have for a relationship. It's pretty easy to mistake certain ideas as your own which you learned from media or social convention in reality. This is hardest part to be completely honest to yourself.  If you want a relationship you should also include your partner's expectation to a certain degree. Take your time, take notes on your ideas, review them, change them until you'll feel comfortable about all of them."

I was changing in large, visible ways, and it scared her.   What you're going through, is like the last stand of fitness tests designed at messing with nice guys. If you were ever stuck in the nice guy archetype, like I was, being called an asshole or a narcissist or whatever else cuts in a way that nothing else does, because you were trained your whole life to abhor those qualities and equate them with abuse.  They're not abuse. There is nothing wrong with focusing on your needs and desires. Stay the course. Eventually, when she realizes that you pass those fitness tests, they'll stop.  That's what happened with me and my wife. After about 2 weeks of being called an asshole every time I was assertive. She stopped. I wasn't making her sad.

And even before we married (engagement = she wins and does not have to suck cock or anything else you enjoy, because she can ""settle down"" and be made a respectable woman), I watched her take away everything I enjoyed when we were dating.

Getting married is extremely risky these days and IMO not worth it. This isn't to say all guys should just divorce tomorrow, but most guys have no idea what they are getting into, at least not until after they get married, how obviously your balls are on the chopping block. This is the problem. Many guys think they are making a good decision, but in fact they don't have enough correct information or perspective to be informed.    right now I'm in a half-a-year LTR, and it feels like I'm in heaven, great sex, great understanding, great Capitain - First Mate dynamic, everything clicks except, like, very minor details.   If you are in heaven because of things (feelings) a chick is giving you, you have successfully put the pussy on a pedestal. The thing about women is they all change. ALL of them, aka AWALT. You don't have a unicorn. Once you put a ring on that you change the dynamic, and she begins to go to work on you to domesticate you, because that's what a ring is nowadays. A lot of women don't even know they're doing it, but I have seen it so many times with other women turned wives I thought might still be old school... NOPE. There are a lot of guys who become beta in a few years, even though they used to be alpha. The ride the wave well almost by accident because their woman is agreeable... Eventually they get the idea from all their friends about how much they can take advantage of their husband and how to do it, OR they just put on a good show and go back to their old self once they secured commitment from you. Trust me on this one... I'm right in the thick of seeing all these guys in my social circle march right toward betadom, one after another, after another and they don't know any better. You aren't that different from them because you think the rules of Marriage 1.0 still apply. That you LTR/plate/whatever has incentive to keep it that way after. She doesn't, because her biology, culture, family, friends and society all tell her that she doesn't owe you shit.   The nice thing about being in an LTR is that you can always walk away and be done with it. That isn't the goal with marriage - we have to keep working at it and maintaining frame, because we no longer have the leverage of removing the commitment (aside from divorce)."
marriedredpill,3d1nwa,ford_contour,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"Eureka! I think after about 29 years of my life, I finally understand what diplomas and education certificates are for. Because unless I include a wall-of-text disclaimer in my post I will get the same things thrown at me, which are completely not what I asked for, because people are not sure I am skilled or educated in certain matters. And even if I do, people have no reason to believe me (I might be delusional). Problem is, there is no authority that would issue a TRP-compliance certificate. So I guess you'll have to trust me when I say the following.   I am aware about ""putting pussy on the pedistal"" problem. I am definetly NOT doing that. There has been not a single case where I had to compromise with this woman. I did not have to cull my natural desires, I did not have to alter my tastes or habbits. She supports my lifestyle, my choices and my decisions one hundred percent, even when she's not entirely agreeing (but she mostly does). Her arguing (which is very rare) never goes to a point of demanding me to accept her opinion, but merely to the point of ""let us agree to disagree"". I am aware what ""domestication"" is and I will not allow it to happen to me. I am aware about risks of marriage. I must inform you that I am from Russia, Saint-Petersburg and based on what I hear about your western society, you guys are completely FUCKED compared to us. I mean, we have most of the same problems, but at way lesser levels. There is divorce rape, but it's not nearly as severe. There are useless ""damaged gods"" women, but not as abundant. There is a ""cock carousel"", but it's way toned down and women are in general less promiscous. Therefore marriage is objectively way less bad of a deal here than it is in the west. I am aware the act of marriage does not mean she'll desire me and be loyal to me forever. I am aware I have to be on my toes at all times in order to keep everything going. I have a way of keeping my assets safe and will consult a very skilled and loyal family lawyer about what sorts of precautions I have to take, before I decide to marry. I understand people change. I also agree with Ironwood's ""Husband and Wife is a job description"" quote. It will be discussed before marriage that the marriage will be void if she (or I) no longer fulfills the role. I am not going to stay married to a woman who degraded because of whatever outside influence and is only influencing me in bad way and does not follow my lead.

If I didn't believe it in your previous post, I do now.   I used to fix cars. One brand was notorious for being all-around shitty, and until I got around to fixing them I just thought there average cars, that people bought because they were enough good things about them - realistic incentives. Well, now I tell anyone who asks my opinion to stay away from that brand because of my experience, not because I hate the brand pre say, but because I know better than to recommend junk - the junk doesn't do anyone any favours. A lot of people have the habit of buying the junk because they are totally unaware of what they are. Why is the brand junk? Because the entire company mindset and philosophy is rotten to the core. The don't need to make a good product, the old mentality of the present customer base is so engrained that it is almost self sustaining, because they teach everyone else that things are just good enough to make it worth it.

I know /r/TRP has a hard-on for Russian/Asian types, but trust me it makes no difference. They all have exposure to all the bullshit, the entitlement... It's in their nature! There are certain cultures that are still doing an OK job keeping a lid on hypergamy, but unless you pick up some herder's daughter from Siberia and keep her away from all modern culture, she is likely going to learn how to put more pressure on you. More, as in figure out how to do it more effectively and break you quicker. Because they are always looking to do that shit. AWALT.

It's not bad, not yet. Once that box gets opened it snowballs. Do you think that women only have two options between the CC and good little submissive girl in marriage just because of your traditions? A.W.A.L.T.    I understand people change.

I am not going to stay married to a woman who degraded because of whatever outside influence and is only influencing me in bad way and does not follow my lead.   The state determines the terms of the marriage. Your vows may mean something to you which is why you're considering it, but your government (and mine) effectively gives incentive for divorce rape. Once the incentives for divorcing you outweigh the incentives to keeping her word, you're fucked. And just because it's not possible for it to be as severe now doesn't mean Russia, or any country is going to have the same laws 20 years down the road.    As a married dude, which kind of qualities do you find most important in a wife?   I would tell my own brother not to get married, regardless of how unicorn-like she was. I have the advantage of being able to leverage my own wife's traditional background but the same rules apply.  Edit: I should say that I have said what I think I needed to.

Re-read what /u/scrub_runner said a couple of times, too. No matter who you marry, the rules apply to you as much as it does to any of us.  That disclaimer aside, many of us married really well. I am one of them. Every RP principle still applies. There are no unicorns.  My wife is incredibly loyal, and a terrific and honest communicator, which helps a ton.  I took a good look at her mother before we married, so she's still hot after two kids. :)  We had a lot of the more difficult conversations about values before we married, but values change, so I am glad I picked someone loyal over someone agreeable."

If she was poorly raised, has wrecked her own personality and damaged her ability to pair bond, it's not going to work. If we have mutually exclusive traits or unfitting personalities, it's going to be unnesecarily edgy. If she is perfect at the role of an LTR (meaning, sex and spending time doing stuff we both enjoy or partaking in leisure) that doesn't mean she'll be good at being a wife.   That's why I'm asking. If it would be as easy as me being a well-built man... but it's not. Hence my question in the OP.  By saying ""someone loyal over someone agreeable"" you mean, you picked a person who could stay with you and follow your lead rather than a person who fitted your personality traits, hobbies, interests and obsessions at the point when you were in pre-martial relationship?"

I did not have anything to say back because I was done with the conversation before it started because I was waiting for it. I was not trying to ignore her or give in to her shit test.

Don't try to change her to back up her word, that is not accepting women for whom they are. So if the last name isn't important for you, let it go, and instead, focus to lead in areas that are truly critical and important for you first. Lead focusing on the concrete, the here and the now. The rest will follow once she respects your leadership."

My advice:    Drop the bomb about the weight, take the fallout. Like, tell her clearly you don't find her attractive at her current weight. This will catalyze a bunch of issues, and could break things badly, but actually you'll be no worse off. Then keep up the pressure and support if she starts to shape up because she won't see this issue clearly for a while. Never, ever, waver in improving yourself. Show zero weakness.

This requires you to take her off the pedestal and you become ""apathetic about your marriage.""    Putting yourself first does not mean you become ultimately apathetic but a move in that direction is unavoidable.   I still spent two decades placating her while secretly resenting her for not being what I really wanted, like the motherfucker of all covert contracts. So now my frustration is that I know logically I have no one to blame but me and no one to fix it but me, but I still have years of beta bitch emotions contradicting what I know in my gut.

So broken you can't really know what's best for you. You need to fix yourself at least a little to see the whole picture. Then you can decide.   Therefore, try to focus on yourself. Not on indulging yourself, but fixing yourself. Distance a bit from your wife, if she starts nagging tell you that you need some time to get your life back in order. Put everything else on life support (fulfilling your obligations to your family but nothing else) and focus on fixing yourself. Taking back control of your life. Your life, not hers. Your hobbies, your self-image, your body, your behavior, what you eat, how you present yourself etc.  Then you will be able to think about her and wehter you want to have something with her or with someone else.

marriedredpill,3cwq73,GregariousWolf,2,Sat Jul 11 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"You and I have walked the same path.    My wife is fat and I haven’t been attracted to her in years, but I never said anything because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings.   I did the same thing. Sparing her feelings is a mistake. I tried everything, except the truth. I tried to drop hints.  I tried to ""lead by example"".  I tried getting her to go to the gym with me. I tried to get her to eat healthy. I tried taking her to a nutritionist and a personal trainer. I tried cooking and portioning all her meals. I tried everything except saying, ""bitch, you fat. You make my dick go soft. Stop stuffing yo face.""  Why was I so afraid of telling her this? Could the consequences have been any worse than what was already going on? One thing I've learned is that there's no easy way to tell her, but not telling her is worse than telling her.   But I’m still always trying to figure out how to do the right thing, the right way so she’ll be happy. It makes me fucking hate myself sometimes.    You know what? It makes her hate you, too. That seems to be the principle irony of marriage. I busted my ass for my wife. The harder I worked to make her happy, the less happy she was. And conventional wisdom says when she is unhappy to re-double your efforts. To ""work on the relationship"" whatever this means. Do what she says. Do what she wants. Prove you love her. After compromising so much of myself, I felt like I had nothing left. I had no friends, no hobbies, no identity. I hated myself. And for her part, instead of her respect and admiration, all I had was criticism and contempt. Why should she respect and admire me, when at home I was a servile little toady?   At work, I’m a completely different person, confident, assertive, and always running my shit. I’ve been very successful in my field and could never understand why I always feel so effective in that environment and so ineffective at home.   Again, similar story with me.  Why doesn't the effectiveness at the office translate into success at home? My thought on this is that it has to do with the nature of male and female power.  Male power is overt. Female power is covert. This is the yin and yang.  The working world is man's world.  I mean this not in the misogynistic sense. I am not saying that women don't belong in the workplace. What I am saying is that it is a man's world in the sense that it is an overt world. It is a world of clear expectations. There are objective criteria that you must meet. It you do not meet goals, you do not stay employed. It's that simple. Relationships with wives are just not the same as office relationships.    I just know that I can’t spend the next 20 years the way I’ve spent the last 20.   The longer we were together, the meaner she got. One day, after fifteen years together, I took a long hard look at her after she bitched me out for using too much dish washing liquid. She once told me how she wanted to ""grow old together"" and I asked myself what I really thought she would be like once we reached our sixties. My blood ran cold.  So, the power is in your hands to improve yourself and your own self-esteem. That is all your are responsible for. I made myself responsible for her happiness, and of course, I failed. We can only be responsible for our own happiness. For your sake, I hope you take charge of your own happiness. I can't say whether your situation is salvageable or not.  But as RedPillProfessor said, anger directed at yourself should be used to change yourself. Nothing good will come from lashing out at her.   Best wishes."

I think the fake texting is lame though, both in terms of personal integrity, risk and wasted opportunity.

marriedredpill,3cyc0z,SexistFlyingPig,3,Sat Jul 11 22:38:23 2015 UTC,"I have a good friend whose marriage was going through rocky times.  I told him about the red pill.  I talked specifically about dread.    A couple months later, he was at a wedding.  There was an attractive woman there, a couple of years younger than him.  She happened to sit next to him in the row and they chatted before the ceremony.  His family was on the opposite side from her, and his wife was at the far end.  After the ceremony, during the reception, she found him again, and said hello. His wife magically appeared out of nowhere with a glass of his favorite wine and handed it to him.  Since that event, his marriage has completely turned around.  She's a lot more loving, attentive, and appreciative of him and everything he does.   Dread works.  Even in a relationship that is going just fine, dread, not cheating, but dread, works."
marriedredpill,3cyc0z,BluepillProfessor,2,Sun Jul 12 00:48:41 2015 UTC,"A little bit of Dread goes a long way.  I don't recommend spending an entire month at each level because I want to waste your time.  I recommend it because it really is that powerful.  Dread is a necessary ingredient in any relationship but it is fatal in anything but measured amounts.  By ""fatal"" I mean to much Dread makes you check out just as it makes your wife check out-  and then it is game over.  I think fake internet accounts reeks of PUA tactics and their failures at LTR's (because the initial attraction was based on a 'game' or routine and not ""genuine"" I would presume) suggests a different path for married guys may be advisable.  In the time it takes to set up a fake internet account and send yourself messages, you could read a PUA book and practice approaches for an hour.

Went out thursday. .i took charge ordering drinks dinner and the places we go, dressed like a million dollars . My wife hates to have sex after dinner..i get the im full excuse..we go home..she is dead tired and full we take a shower, i am gettinf the feeling ok no sex tonite dont get mad..wife starts saying in the shower, im full..tired etc..i say no problem like it doesn't faze me. Get in bed and i get the lets have sex...lol so i oblige..i am railing her while her head is hitting the headboard, on top of that she is telling me to play with her asshole. Next morning we wake up..my hip is killing me from the position lol...usually i would give her a kiss wrap my arms around her..i just laid there and we lightly chatted...she starts to kiss me ok...we kiss..i expect nothing..and she keeps kissing me..then i get the lets have sex like last night same way..we do..i fuck her hard again...i dont even ask like i normally would but i start fingering her asshole and boy did she cum..so far so good..don't get me wrong it isnt easy as i am new and learning.i am saying no..i am being me..not mr nice guy...another funny thing while we are doing errands a cute lady is carrying her dog around the supermarket. .my wife goes up to the dog smiles and pets it..tells me she is so cute..i say which one lol..wife laughs i laugh..normally i wouldnt say shit like that..."

I take my woman out alot but because its that I LIKE to get drunk and eat good food and come home to fuck.  She felt the dread. Your dressing up. Your new non neediness as far as sex. This not only got her attention but it TURNED HER ON. You have begun acting like a man now. Men have sex with women and she doesnt want to lose that man.  Stick around and keep us posted  PS  You dont have a great marriage without sex. That is called a roommate or BFF. Get that bluepill attitude fixed.

It wasn't a date night that got me laid you are right. Othertimes we go out she is full and tired and doesn't want to have sex..i complain we fight..the circles starts all over. Thursday night when i said no big deal with the sex..magically after being tired and full she wants to fuck..as a matter of fact we are away for the weekend now. Out to see friends.  We went out last night she is hungover this morning. We go take a shower together..i have the morning wood. She is laughing saying you got a boner, i laugh and say yup..i was her in the shower she washed me..plays with my cock a little like a tease and exits the shower...normally i would be pissed and be like what the fuck..i say nothing..stay calm and cool. She has a headache and asks if i brought her vibrator that she likes...i forgot it and tell her ..she complains a little..i dont respond..we walk back to the bedroom and i tell her i didnt bring the vibrator. .but im hard and lets fuck..we fuck..this is the same woman who asked me to layoff about asking her for sex for a month...she didn't say a word about it. So i got laid 3 days in a row. Friends are saying i look good, after we had sex she was saying you look good..dressing nice..giving me all these compliments. Then she says the bed was squeeky so we have to be quiet as we are in a friends house...so i say you are right, when we come back home later we can fuck on the floor...she says sounds like a great idea ....where has this woman been for the last year?? This is the woman i married...these changes are not only getting me laid..im happier..the wife is happier...things are going better than i could've imagined. I know i will slip up, i know i might lose frame..i am new to this but im gonna try my hardest. Things are on the up and up. One thing i do recall that threw me for a loop was about 6 months ago..dressed nice..dinner etc..went out friends..we had some argument with one of my buddies who sorta fucked up with me and my wife..no biggie..i handled it and told him in front of my wife you are fucked up..etc etc..going home my wife was like you were so manly and aggressive i loved it..i am that nice beta guy..implementing some alpha as per my readings has helped me out...just opened my eyes and realized i was a little alpha back then and she loved it..this woman needs me to take charge at times..i do and i love it...also my dick is sore lol"

marriedredpill,3ctyqd,BluepillProfessor,6,Sat Jul 11 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"great post-- there are so many surprises that have come with TRP.  1) Her bad moods are HER bad moods. The best way to deal with a womans emotional ride is not to fight it, not to run from it, but to stand tall and amplify YOUR good mood.  Let the waves of feminine emotion crash and break on the big rock (you). Its amazing how quickly a woman can and WILL adopt a stronger, happier frame.  2) Dont be afraid to make her jealous. Even the Beta ultcad attracted woman as I was lucky enough to look good even though inside I was a needy mess. I used to react when gfs/wife got jealous and try and make them feel better that they had nothing to fear. BIG MISTAKE!  Your woman wants a man that other women want. jeaousy turns her on and she will fuck you passionately to keep your mind off those other bitches. Dread game is an important tool in an LTR. Read up on it and feel free to PM me when you learn new ways to use it. I want to learn.  3) Push and pull on her emotions. you cant ALWAYS be ""a dick"". Find random (not her birthday) times to surprise her and make her feel she is in a ""love story"".  Pull her away for a half hour here and there and just listen to her stories and stroke her hair. Tell her its been too long since you REALLY connected and want to make sure you are both caught up. Do NOT tell her a word about anything thats going on in your life, especally if its stressful.   You take care of her needs and emotions. You dont need or expect same in return. You are a man afterall"

(PrePS: retyped it still a long rant, read last two paragraphs if you read any of it at all.)  You've never had a doormat girlfriend? I know most guys are never the one doing the dumping in relationships but when you are and you try to analyze why you're being this piece of shit person to someone who is, on paper, so good for you, you realize that it's not just a female thing.   Source: had gf who could go fuck any guy in any bar (at least for a ONS - not saying much but nobody would say this girl wasn't hot) had she wanted to and she basically became a beta bitch to me and what did I do? I basically turned into a total douche. I'd say shit just to see if she'd agree with me... I'd do whatever I wanted, cancel plans, make her bring me dinner...   Sound familiar? Lack of self respect gets you this treatment no matter your gender/sex. The reason that this sub is for men is because women usually have 800 other options sitting around and men have a huge scarcity mentality.   Reason women get alpha widowed is that all these other options are so easy and of course the one thing just out of reach is the one thing you really want. But if that option she saw as the second coming of God starts to wipe her ass after she shits and agree with whatever she says just because she said it, then what different is he from the other 799 beta orbiters throwing their dicks, time, and resources at her?   Analogy  If I give you a standard nice looking watch and it says ""special edition 1/1"" you're going to fucking rock that shit every damn day, brag to your friends, throw all your old watches in the back of a drawer, and feel pretty damn special because you have this highly limited watch you love and since it's so limited it must be coveted... but then you've worn it for a year and the dial is peeling a bit under the glass... so you are like “shit this watch isn't perfect... but it's still my 1/1 limited edition that's saying something!”... and then the dial peels more and you see Timex, Serial #127472234 ... and you're like ""the fuck?!? This watch was special limited edition”... and so you go digging through that drawer because you swear you’ve seen this somewhere before... and lo and behold… you thought this watch was limited edition but it was just a fraud… it’s the exact same as all your old watches… so now why would you wear it everyday? Why would you covet this watch that is nothing special at all? You wouldn’t… cue guy beta backsliding (becoming a doormat) and getting dumped.  Now say you have that same 1/1 special edition watch and someone takes it away from you… sure there are Timex on every single corner… they can tell time just as good… probably look just about as good, but this watch was different and now you want it even more after losing it.

I was told I needed to give up my lifting weights and martial arts once I got married because ""no woman can be expected to put up with a guy who doesn't do his half of the housework and child care.""  I was told to treat girls like my equal and that if I respected them enough they would drown in gushing vaginal fluids.  With TRP/MRP I learned that ""Nice Guys"" are not really nice- in fact they are dishonest jerks hiding their passion.  I learned that talking to much and being emotionally available all the time is a gigantic turn off for girls.  I learned that ""Choreplay"" is and always was, a lie.

I have no desire to leave her, share kids, figure out finances, and then get back into the grind of fucking plates.  I'd rather keep her, fuck other chicks until I get over it(I haven't yet and said I wouldn't be searching but I found myself on Craigslist 'personal encounters' today), or eventually leave, but for now, this is the best decision for me.

Whether it involve some guy not reading enough side bar material or not internalizing the pill, whatever it may be, I'm kinda stumped why no one has torn into this post.  Who gives a shit about your wife making a big deal about an unattainable movie star?  A few people have mentioned you were too reactive to the situation instead of taking control from jump street, of which I agree.    However, it is deeper than that- why do you give a shit about your wife gushing over a movie star?  Why does it bother you at all?  Where's your confidence?  It feels like a covert contract to me.  ""She's not supposed to be attracted to other men.""  Bullshit.  She came home and wanted to fuck, and it seems like your response was passive aggressive in nature.  ""I came quickly without worrying about getting her off first""  While there is not anything intrinsically wrong with this at all, you point out that you usually want round 2.  You were obviously butt hurt to some extent over the movie, hence the post in the first place.  I'm no MRP guru, but make sure you are being completely honest with yourself and us.  Even your 3 possible responses are still passive aggressive.  Fuck that movie man, own your shit.  She is still coming home to you to fuck.  You missed some opportunities to be the man at that dinner, you could have had a shit load of fun with the whole situation.  Instead, you let a shitty movie affect your  mood and your relationship.    You can't negotiate desire.

You should've been teasing her about him from the get go and mentioned to her his model wife.   For the record, you working on yourself will get you closer to looking like him than she is ever going to get to looking like her. Channing is 37, there are very few women in the world that would be a sex symbol like him at 37. Most are well below 30."

marriedredpill,3cwsp5,RedPillForever,2,Sat Jul 11 14:57:51 2015 UTC,This is a good response. The right movie can basically be like getting her to watch her favorite porn. No need to get butthurt or jealous of porn. It's a tool to make her more fun.

Your level of butt hurt is about an 8.  Should have joked about it or used the fact that she's all wound up to make sexy time a little hotter. Hell, laugh at her and moan ""ohhh. . Fuuuuuucckkkk. ... Channing baby"" during sex."

I took my shirt off and did a short stripper dance. Then I threw her over my shoulder, carried her to our bedroom and fucked her like a disposable party girl.  Later we saw a different movie."

You are seeing the reality. Your wife wants chad thundercock over you. That is a truth we should all face. AWALT. Remember this whenever you think of skipping gym day. recall it when you are not sure if you should do that extra set of weights. That's right, lift angry! Take advantage of this opportunity to ENCOURAGE your wife to get sexually alive. If it takes a movie or novel to get her dirty, then good news for you... because she is getting dirty.  However, Fuck this up, and it only encourages her to stifle these HONEST feelings until she can express them somewhere without you.  The winning response is the opposite of what you are doing. What I would say to her seeing it with the sister? ""Honey, you should go see it, and you can think about Tatum while I ram you from behind. In fact little sister, go see it with her and I will take care of you both!"" realize you are being a little bitch about this. Seriously dude. Welcome to reality. Man up or go home."

marriedredpill,3cwsp5,RedPillForever,6,Mon Jul 13 10:09:48 2015 UTC,"This all comes down to you screwed up by saying 'yes' when you meant 'no'.  Check out the book, ""When I say No, I feel guilty"", the first chapter covers 'broken record', which is what you need here.  You don't bargain - it's not a negotiation if you feel this strongly about it. You don't practice active listening (usually a great tool!) when she brings this subject up, because it's not up for discussion.  You don't threaten divorce - threats are used by weak men.  You simply politely repeat the exact same phrase every time she brings it up, from now on.   Choose the phrase carefully. It needs to respect the fact that she is an independent person who can and may do what she wants.   You may talk about your feelings. As the captain, your default assumption is that she respects your feelings, whether that's true or not.  You may include your expectations for her behavior, always phrased in the positive. This is where you set the new precedent for future behavior.  Since she's already made plans with her sister, and you already saw it with her, I say let it happen - skip that battle. Fighting it just highlights your previous screw ups and make you look wishy washy. Like it or not, you made a ruling on that and need to live with it.   Practice your outcone independence when it happens, if it does. Don't go to a strip club yourself unless you genuinely feel fine about bringing that back into play on both sides. (Hint: you pretty clearly don't!)  You should also read 'Way of the Superior Man' ASAP to better understand how to practice outcome independence and every time she brings this little event up. That book will tell you why you should expect her to mention this incident in public often and how you need to respond.   Spoiler: you respond as the perfect gentleman does when his wife or child had too much to drink and acts out in public. i.e. You restate your core values on a light hearted positive manner on the first offense, and you politely excuse your group from the party on the second.   Both of these behaviors should be no shock whatsoever to your wife, because you will have been practicing broken record to give her predictability and security when she brought it up before.   Odds are that the second time she tests it in public is actually because she knows it's a quick way to get you both home where she can fuck you (or get a nap, or do the taxes, who knows!)."
marriedredpill,3cwsp5,IanIronwood,2,Sat Jul 11 13:55:26 2015 UTC,"You got upset over a fucking movie. Seriously? My wife finds Channing Tatum attractive and so do I. He's a good looking guy. My wife drooled over him too, at first, when the first Magic Mike came out. I admit I was a little jealous but never showed anger. My response was that every time I went somewhere and a woman looked at me, I would tell her about it. Those women are much more attainable than Channing Tatum for her. Shut her up real quick.  She's never seen either of the movies."
marriedredpill,3cwsp5,RedPillForever,4,Tue Jul 14 19:41:20 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to shut the hell up and fuck her like Conan after she gets back.  Any other response is going to be seen as weakness by your wife.    That being said, if you want to take it up a level and make a strong point, I would counter her passion over the professional pecs with a covert response.  Tell her you're taking her out, look nice. Then take her to a decent dinner, and instead of following it with drinks or a movie . . . take her ass to a strip club.  INSIST on her going in, even make a surprise double-date with another couple, if you can.    Before you get in the door, when her hamster is freaking the fuck out, quietly tell her to take off her wedding ring and hand it to you.  Put your ring with it and put them both in the inside coat pocket of your suit.  Don't explain, don't let her make a scene, just firmly insist that she do it.  Get her inside.  Pay the fee at the door with a big wad of cash, don't let her talk.  If you can, get a reservation; if you can afford it, get a VIP table.  Once your wife is seated, eyes wide and looking around at the scene, order two drinks quickly, then excuse yourself (leaving her alone at the table) to go speak to the head bouncer/security guard.  Give him $20 and tell him you would appreciate it if he made sure things go smoothly this evening.  You have scored an ally.  Let your wife ask three quiet questions at the table during your first drink.  Answer any that you can that involve the operations of the club or the girls.  Any that involve your motivations don't answer or give a cocky Amused Mastery response.  Watch a few dances with your arm protectively around her.  Second round, order a soft drink or water while you order her another stiff drink.  While you're waiting, spot the strippers in the joint who a) look most like your wife and b) are objectively the hottest.  Make a point to learn each of their names.  Then buy a lapdance from b, while your wife watches . . . and then pay for stripper (a) to give your wife a lapdance.  If you can get her to this point without freaking out and requiring the assistance of your ally, invite both strippers to stay a few moments for a drink and a chat.  Discuss the experience of watching your wife and her (hotter) twin together, and be effusive with your praise about stripper (b)'s beauty, grace, flexibility, tits, ass, etc.  Be respectful and complimenting.  DO NOT refer to your wife as ""your wife"".  Only give your first name.  Act like an out-of-town bigshot who has taken his cheating mistress out for a night of debauchery.  Pay significant attention to the strippers, while keeping a little distance from your wife.  After the drink, thank both ladies elegantly and then settle back into the booth with your wife.    She could respond a lot of ways, depending on her mood, feelings, etc.  She may be horny as hell and want to go bang in the car, or she could feel humiliated and pissed off about the experience.  Either way, expect a relationship discussion out of it.  And when the the almost-inevitable issue of feeling like you were treating her poorly and disrespectfully come up, quietly lean into her and say ""Now you know how I feel every time you bring up that fucking pre-fab-abs movie.  Fun, isn't it?""  Tailor your responses as you see fit, and only attempt if you feel confident you can pull it off, but properly applied this can be a serious Reset button on your marital sex life.  And a way to gain some respect from your callous wife.  Good luck!"

You're highlighting to her that you were so upset by her fantasizing about a guy she'll never meet, that you needed to put on an elaborate, expensive display to try to upset her the same way. All that's going to do it etch in stone that if she wants to upset you, all she has to do is openly fantasize about some hot celebrity. You're not getting rid of behavior you don't like, you're weaponizing it against yourself.  Plus chatting up strippers after you've paid them for a dance and thinking that makes you look strong or interesting to women, is like thinking that fucking a prostitute after paying her makes you sexy. Of course she's talking to you. You're paying her rent."

marriedredpill,3cwsp5,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"You're thinking about it from a male perspective, not a female one.  The date night lures her into security mode.  The shift in plans to somewhere slaps that switch off in a big way, and pre-loads plenty of reluctance and excitement at the same time.  Her admiration for hot male strippers on screen is meeting the gritty reality of the stripping world, Masculine style.  Crisis mode.  Hamster is in the house.  Removal of wedding rings is another jarring move that forces her to consider not just the overt sexuality of the moment, but put it into the context of their relationship.  This isn't just a quick curiosity-indulging trip the the club, but something in which their symbol of commitment and fidelity itself is involved.  Most wives feel naked without their wedding rings.  Without a wedding ring in a strip club with a man - even her husband - also without a wedding ring removes the tangible sign of social protection implicit in being a wife.  Without it, she can't instantly invoke the ""I'm Married! Protect Me!"" response she's used to.  The safety net is gone.  She's just some middle-aged chick in a strip club with a middle-aged dude.  Worst yet, she has the possibility of BEING SEEN without her ring, in a strip club, by someone within her social circle.  It strips her of her comfortable identity before rubbing her nose in the real point of the exercise.  Excitement on HIGH.  Hamster on HYPERSPEED.  In the back of her mind ""Why the hell is he doing this to me?""  The goal of the exercise here is not to prove that you can get women by the power of your sexuality . . . it's that any man with fairly limited resources can get the kind of female attention her husband theoretically gets from her for a thick roll of ones.  And be happy with the result.    Her solipsism makes her simultaneously identify with the ""oppressed"", ""beautiful"", overtly sexual strippers while she naturally resents their youth beauty and apparent attraction.  Her social conditioning automatically shifts to demeaning them in comparison - the ""they're only stupid whores, after all""  subroutine - while her hamster is also flying into the fantasy of ""I wonder what it's like to be so desirable to men that they're willing to pay for just a flash of tit and a wiggle?""   What you are doing here, if you are aware and in control of the situation, is to create a perfect psychological storm in her mind.  From this point you could go in many different directions, and you WILL get a conflict out of it, but if you can be a man and hold frame and mean that shit, I think you might be surprised by the potential results."

marriedredpill,3ctscw,zxDanKwan,0,Mon Jul 13 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, but there is a more subtle advantage to my approach, if you will read my experience.  TL;WR - Figure out how to use the hamster to your advantage.  My wife used to chew me out all the time for not texting or calling her that I would be late.  Mind you - I would text her when I was on my way home. She wanted me to stop whatever I was doing before I was late, and let her know I was going to be late.  And, of course, she wanted to know how long it would be until I was on my way home.  Fuck that noise.  I refuse to put myself on a leash like that, especially one that short, so I would just continue to text her when I was actually on my way home. And, of course, she would try and fight with me about it. I would A&A, or deflect, or whatever, and we'd get past it for the night, but it would come up at least a couple times a week.  4 months ago, I guess she decided she would try and give me a dose of my own medicine.  She was heading out for the day, and I told her I wanted her home at 5. That was when I was done with work, and she was complaining about not getting enough time with me. After some hemming and hawing about traffic making it hard to promise 5, I gave her until 5:30, and she agreed.  I made it clear that this was me prioritizing her, for her, so don't fuck around.  She texted me at 5:34 saying she was running late, but was on her way.  Whatever. I was jammin on my bass, and had just found my pocket, so I wasn't in any rush for her to be home. OI at it's finest.  All I said to her was ""That's fine, baby. You know I understand how easy it can be to lose track of time. I'm just glad to know we're not going to have any more arguments about me not texting you when I'm running late.""  Guess what she hasn't bitched about once in 4 months?

marriedredpill,3ctscw,cholomite,0,Fri Jul 10 21:57:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, I didn't do the best job of explaining my situation.  As a sales-based employee, I don't have a set time to be done with work. Haven't for the past 8 years. It has always been ""I'm done when I get X number of tasks done, however long that takes."" That's how it needs to be for me to make my monthly targets. That's what made her consistent pushing for that particularly unreasonable from my perspective. It's just not how my job works.  Likewise, if I say ""I'm going to hang out with my friends, we'll be done somewhere around 11ish, and I'll text you when I'm on my way home,"" do I owe her a text at exactly 11 saying ""we're not done yet"" ? Or can we agree that texting at 11:30 to say ""on my way home"" is a fair response?  Whether it's at work or personal, if I set a specific time, I'll keep to it. If someone else wants to measure me to a standard I didn't agree to, then they're likely to end up unsatisfied.  Hopefully, by my ability to shift her 4 minute delay into a permanent end to one of her biggest gripes without ending up divorced, you can safely surmise that I'm not as shitty as it might read in plain text over the internet."

She has to go and sign off on the account, she has not done this yet    Don't like this.  You both have decent jobs? Split bills, put some in joint interests and the the rest is nunya.   If your rent is late, and it's her fault, she pays the late fees.  If it comes to where you're getting threats from landlord, then you need to threaten having to downgrade-move.   Also get on her BEFORE rent is due on the contributions. 5 days before hand both of you should enter your portions into the pool.  Make sure you pay YOUR shit on time. If you didn't in the past and corrected...great. She's not your mommy, and any bringingupthepast is just a way to knock you down a peg. Ignore, flip or A.M.  [EDIT]  as for this:   I'll also fix things around the house on my schedule, which is generally a little more flexible than my wife's schedule.   Right. The only way. You don't work for her. It's your rental as well.  Sorry , see I misread what this was about.  She needs to pay for her portion of the trip. If you don't want to go you could pull the plug if she doesn't pay, but then I'd plan to go do something by yourself. It all depends on how bad the situation is at the moment and how far along you are. At my point I may just get on her, at a newb or just swallowing and anger point...having to shake up the old dynamic I'd be more likely to nuke the trip."

Your problem is that you never set the boundary in the first place -  ""Don't invite people to stay in my home without asking"" or you set the boundary but then didn't enforce it.  Your wife will be 10 times more likely to push your buttons when she feels like she can get away with it because her family is there for support.  Let's be honest here - locking her out of the bedroom wasn't exactly the best way to enforce your (perhaps unspoken?) boundary.    If you are going to set the boundary, you must be able to enforce it.  You should expressly set the boundary and consequences after your wife's family leaves.  To be honest, the natural consequence here is pretty damn simple, if I came home to uninvited houseguests I'd simply have my wife tell them all to leave before I did it myself in a manner that her guests wouldn't enjoy."
marriedredpill,3cqvri,RPAlternate42,3,Fri Jul 10 01:24:47 2015 UTC,Do you agree with the 5 X 5 to maximum weight for the major muscle groups?
marriedredpill,3cqvri,BluepillProfessor,2,Fri Jul 10 03:56:09 2015 UTC,"It's good for beginners. Add chinups though, they're left out of most 5x5 programs.  After that, when you can lift to failure with good form, switch to a lower volume program qhwew you lift to failure regularly. Lifting to failure is important - you're not getting the volume from 5x5 so you need to bust your muscles hard instead. Include sets with 10-12 reps to induce growth in both types of fast twitch muscle fibres. So some sets are 5, others 10-12. 2-3 sets per exercise. Structure it however you want. I prefer to do 5, 12 per exercise on most exercise, and pick a few I'm trying to progress on and those I do 5, 12, 12 or 5, 5, 12 depending on whether it is the high or low rep weight I'm focusing on. Others like to group their 5s and 12s together, so one day is just 5 reps, other days just 12 reps.  There are also many who swear by 7-8 reps, but it always felt a bit meh to me.   The above is assuming you're going for hypertrophy. Powerlifting is different."
marriedredpill,3cqvri,Sepean,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:45:52 2015 UTC,I wanna know the answer too.
marriedredpill,3cqvri,thelotusknyte,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:12:24 2015 UTC,"5x5 is a good all-round workout... a bit of growth, some strength... but it will never do all of them by itself.  The fact is that you need higher reps at lower weights for hypertrophy and high weight at low reps to encourage fiber recruitment.  You will plateau and then progress very slowly on 5x5 after about 12 weeks.  Coupled with the fact that no 5x5 program endorses a de-load cycle as part of the program means many guys may injure themselves at worst and become bored due to CNS fatigue at best.  5x5 programs can be tailored to be a little more robust, but I will always endorse a periodized program with a solid accessory program as an advanced system.   5x5 is for beginners Split programs like PHUL are for intermediates 5/3/1 and 8/6/3 or for advanced lifters."

marriedredpill,3cqvri,42andatowel,2,Fri Jul 10 17:32:04 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to why the 10 week limit?   SL 5x5 has no deload built in... so you'll end up doing this for 1 weeks straight and then get CNS fatigue which manifests as boredom and an unwillingness to do the work.  If you de-load for a week after 4 weeks you can extend it to about 15 weeks... but you'll still plateau without a proper progression system.  I would go to a 5/3/1 template afterwards.  I will always recommend them and there are so many to choose from.  www.blackironbeast.com

marriedredpill,3cqvri,DanAffid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:52:24 2015 UTC,"After lifting for 4-6 weeks, the body needs time to recover, fully repair, and just generally have stress reduced.  This helps prevent injury from repetition and from general wear-and-tear.  during De-Load you do less volume and/or less intensity.  Example, if your mesocycle had you doing 75%RM for 4 sets of 8, then your deload would be 50% for 4 sets of 8 (less intense) or 75% for for sets of 5 (less volume) or a mix of the two.  The goal is to do something but far less than normal.  Use the link I provided and make a template, then look at aweek 4 to see how the intensity and volume decreases."
marriedredpill,3cqvri,DanAffid,2,Tue Jul 14 20:06:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I was going to ask what SL 5x5 was, but I just googled that myself and found the answer.  Pretty straightforward.  Now to get a gym membership and find a time-slot to workout in.  Any recommendations for a quick, easy prep/eat lunch, like protein shakes, etc.  I could probably work this into my lunch break at work if I can get on-track with what to eat for lunch.  The drinks are going to be harder.  I drink way too many sodas.  I don't do/can't stand coffee.  Milk and water are fine.  Also, I don't drink beer.

Right now I'm mostly doing body weight exercises - trying to strengthen my legs and core, and work on cardio to get ready for a backpacking trip.  My plan when I get back is to start lifting and cut calories simultaneously.  I don't think I'll build muscles very quickly, if at all, that way.  My goal is just to lose weight and do the lifting just to establish / maintain my habit of going to the gym, and keep from losing any muscle I do have.  When I've lost enough fat then I'll start working on bulking up.  Even if I were to develop big manly muscles right now, they couldn't really be seen under all the fat.  I have a personal trainer too but I'm not sure he's worth what I pay him.  It keeps me motivated going to the gym but that's about it."
marriedredpill,3cqvri,Redneck001,2,Fri Jul 10 16:46:02 2015 UTC,I'm doing this:  https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout  For about 2 months and see nice results. What fitness program would you recommend as the next step?
marriedredpill,3cqvri,Sepean,3,Fri Jul 10 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"The Blaha 5x5 mesocycle runs in multiples of 2 weeks (ABA-BAB). My guess is that you have been running this program for about 8 weeks.  As a beginner you likely saw many gains very quickly.      The problem I have with these beginner 5x5 programs is only that they don't utilize a de-load week.  The 5x5 mesocycles should be 5 weeks (4 weeks on, 1 week of de-load.)    Because of the lack of de-load, without knowing your age, I'm going to guess that the program is starting to bore you.  If this is the case I'm going to tell you that you aren't bored, but you are reaching CNS fatigue from the constant and linear progression on the lifts.  You are probably reaching plateaus on a few things.  This is another sign of CNS fatigue.    This fatigue is the result of having no deload and maintaining the same set-rep combination.  I always recommend that Blaha and SL 5x5 be done for no longer than 10 weeks (4 on, 1 off, 4 on 1 off.)    If you are asking for a new program then it is probably best for you to move into one.    To answer your question, I need to know something: What is your goal?     Size? Raw Strength? Aesthetics?"
marriedredpill,3cqvri,bmunny1963,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:00:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comprehensive answer.   I'm 34. I currently aim for size and perhaps a bit of a weight loss (I understand it's hard to combine).   I also do classical boxing 3 times a week (1.5 hr x 3) if it's relevant.
marriedredpill,3cqvri,Sepean,3,Fri Jul 10 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 programs and there are a number of templates to fit your needs.  I am 34 as well:  6'1"", 186 lbs (as of this morning.). I'm on a de-load week from a modified 5/3/1 program I made to fit my schedule, but next week I start a 5/3/1 + body building program.  If you want strict size then it is what I would recommend to you.  Know that size increases weight and if you compete as a boxer this will change your weight class.    5/3/1 is great because it focuses on using the ""Big 4"" to build strict and raw strength, while adding a plethora of accessory options to add mass, size, isolated strength.    The program is periodized, so in week 1 you do 5 reps on the main lifts, then on week 2 you do 3 reps, then on week 3 you do 5-3-1 reps.  week 4 is de-load.  Then you increase your goals, and do it all over again.  For my BB template I am going to progressively add weight as I complete super set, so the weight progression on the accessory lifts is constant, but not brutal.  Example: if I am doing 50# for 12 reps and I do all 4 sets completely, then I will raise the last set by 5 lbs. (50-50-50-55). ONce I can complete that, then I do 50-50-55-55.    This is another issue I have with the 5x5 programs: they don't tell you how to increase the resistance progressively, so most people just arbitrarily raise the weight and then they end up hurting themselves.

However, this   I eat pretty clean so the problem shouldn't be my diet.   is a major red flag for me. People who say ""I eat clean"" usually has zero idea about dieting or exercise. You should be saying ""my macros are on target"".   Provide details: Height, weight, you best guess at your body fat percentage, how many kcals and grams of protein do you eat each day, what is your exact exercise program with sets, reps and weight."
marriedredpill,3cqvri,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:37:44 2015 UTC,"Well, you're right about that. I don't even know what a ""macro"" is in relation to diet. What I meant is that I don't eat junk food and I have a well-balanced diet. I'm 5'9"", 165. Don't know my body fat %. My protein mostly comes from food (fish, chicken, the occasional steak) and a whey powder supplement I've been using (about 50g on workout days). As for my workout program, it's cardio, weights, abs. On the weights, I do 3-5 sets of 12-20 reps (until failure), mostly free weights, med to heavy resistance, short rests in between. Legs on Mon, arms/shoulders on Weds, chest/back on Fri. On Sat, I do full body but fewer sets."
marriedredpill,3cqvri,bmunny1963,2,Fri Jul 10 14:54:09 2015 UTC,"The 2 most important 2 things about your diet are: how many kcals is in it and many grams of protein. Get at least 130g of protein per day.  I assume your weight is stable? That means you're eating at maintenance. Weight everything you eat for a few days, and calculate how many kcals are in it. Then you increase this by 3-400 kcals/day on training days so you have the caloric surplus to put on muscle. That's a slow bulk, you can add kcals on rest days if you want to gain faster, but you'll put on some fat too.  Weights, cut down to 2-3 sets per exercise. Lift to failure but do some sets 5 reps, other 10-12 reps. It strengtens different types of muscle fibre. Going above 12 is pointless.  Stick to the main 6 compound lifts: squats, deadlifts, bench (both flat and incline), overhead press, weighted chinups, rows. Split them over 2 days. Take 3-5 minutes of rest between sets; you want to be rested so you can push hard on each set. Those are your bread and butter, your main exercises you focus on. Add 2 sets of abs and 2 sets of calfs one day, and 2 sets of biceps and 2 sets of triceps on another; none of these should be low rep. You should be looking at 45-60 minutes in the gym.  More calories, longer breaks, fewer sets, fewer reps, fewer exercises, and you'll be adding up to 2lbs of muscle per month."

marriedredpill,3cqvri,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"At your age I would be looking at T-levels.  It doesn't matter how much you lift or how much or what you eat, if you don't have sufficient testosterone, your anabolic system will never respond to the resistance.  Some foods can encourage T-levels... but nothing so much that will bring exceptionally low levels to nominal levels.  Have your doctor test you.    Supplements are just that... Supplemental... specifically, *Supplemental food.    Protein powder is just food.  IF you are already getting your daily requirement for protein, (~1g/lb lean mass) from varying sources, mostly animal (hopefully) then you don't need the powder.  If you eat large amounts of red meat, then you don't need creatine.  If you eat lots of fatty fish then you likely don't need fish-oil.  If your diet is well-rounded, then you likely don't need vitamins.    However, many people can't get that much protein in a day, so the powder helps fill the gaps.  Red meat can be expensive, so creatine helps (more on this in a second) fill this gap.  Vitamins can fill a gap, but taking them all at once tends to make them end up in the toilet rather quickly.    Creatine is a non-essential nutrient found heavily in red meat.  non-essential means your body already makes it.. Specifically, it makes it from the combination of arginine and glycine, two amino acids found in everything.    The great thing about eating creatine is it makes the nutrient immeidately available for uptake into the muscle cells.  All it is, though, is a phosphorus carrier for the production of ATP (the energy molecule for cells.). A muscle can only hold so much and only training to hold more can force it to hold more.  After a fair amount of training, creatine supplementation doesn't hinder or increase capabilities; your body figures out how to make more, faster.    For muscle building creatine comes with the added bonus of requiring more water to be stored in the muscles.  Hypertrophic (low weight, high rep) resistance training encourages the muscles to store more creatine (the primary energy store for short-duration lifting), leading to more stored water and it encourages greater glycogen storage (the primary energy storage for slightly-longer term lifting), which also increases water storage.  Creatine does nothing for actual muscle building, but it can make you look bigger because of the water retention aspect (in the short term.)    Feel free to take whatever supplements you want; it's just food in a very dense form, but for you, at age 51, I would get your T-levels checked.  I don';t have first-hand knowledge, but there are guys in here who have experience with T supplements and they say the change is noticeable and quick.    Your doctor may not prescribe the supplements (god forbid we have men who act like men in the USA) so some guys in here get measured for levels, and then order the T-supps online and do the weight calculation to self-administer.  I have no experience with this."

Might want to look at your intensity before you look into add-ons.  Also, other than creatine and whey, all supplements are basically garbage. The only other direction to go is T injections, but that is a science in and of itself, and I'd check with someone who really knows what they are doing.  Even then, Testosterone just helps repais muscles faster, it doesn't cause growth.. so if you can't put in 2x the time at the gym, you're wasting it largely anyways"
marriedredpill,3cqvri,Warrior77777,2,Fri Jul 10 15:28:15 2015 UTC,"30 minutes of cardio (making sure I vary my heart rate) and about 90 minutes of lifting (working different muscle groups each session that includes about 20 min of ab work each day I work out).

I think your intensity might be too high and you are fatiguing... but if you can do what you need to do in 30-40 minutes then I can't argue that.  Testosterone will trigger anabolic response.

marriedredpill,3cqvri,stonepimpletilists,2,Fri Jul 10 18:56:06 2015 UTC,"Eat less to lose your gut. I'm looking at my body scan from when I was 16½% body fat: 1.1 lbs of fat on an arm, 17.1 lbs on my trunk. That's just how fat is distributed on some of us. Bottom line is, you're not lean just because you don't have big fat deposits on your arm. Eat less to lose weight.  I wouldn't call a full body workout a split :)  Hitting all muscles 3 times per week is good for me if my restitution is good: that means I'm not stressed, I'm eating at least slightly above maintenance, I'm getting enough sleep. Just remember to cycle your exercises, you will not be able to lift as hard at the end of the session.  When I'm cutting, or if my restitution isn't good for some other reason, I prefer to do splits.  If I'm down to two sessions per week, I'll mostly do FBW but stick to 2 sets per exercise, sometimes even just 1.  If you build a mental model of how you have limited restitution ability and the things that affect that, and then consider  Volume: How much total exercise am I doing this week? Am I resting and eating enough to support this training volume?  Frequency: How often am I hitting each muscle? They need at least 48 hours to recover, longer if restitution is suboptimal.  Intensity/CNS fatigue: You just can't push as hard at the end of an FBW session, and you tend to have shorter breaks between sets so many lifts will be weaker. A split allows you take longer breaks and keep sessions shorter so you can push harder on each lift. And as you get better, you need to push HARD on 1 set per exercise for maximum gains.   Once you get that model in place, you can begin making your own schedules. ""I'm cutting so I want a frequency of 3-4 days, so if I can lift 3 times per week I'll do a split. The weeks I can only lift twice, I'll do FBW and remember to cycle different exercises to be first so it isn't always the same getting hit by CNS fatigue; every other session is bench first though because that's my main focus right now."""

marriedredpill,3cqvri,TRPinprogress,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:48:45 2015 UTC,"You can be both.    The idea that you can't comes from the classic body-building approach: Strength Cycle, Mass Cycle (eat a lot), Cut Cycle (calorie deficit.)    The idea is to build raw strength skill up (high weight, 5-1 reps), then move to mass (lower weight, 10+ reps) wherein you need to eat more to build muscle, and then a cut cycle (low weight, 5-10 reps with HIIT conditioning) on a calorie deficit to burn fat off quickly in preparation for competition.    The mass cycle builds mass fast but also comes with extra fat because it's impossible zero-in your calorie intake... so you always eat a little more than you need.  The cut cycle burns fat fast... but at the cost losing strength and some mass in the process.    You can build size and stay cut... but you need to heavily cater your diet to support that and you need to pay close attention to your hydration and daily weight.  The caveat is that you won't build size as fast as you would on a bulk cycle.    Now to your question: Which is more important.. I think you need to find out which is more important, to you?    I think it's better to be big because it's easier to burn fat than it is to gain muscle; I can function on a 1000 calorie deficit per day and lose fat quickly... YMMV.    A lot of guys talk about Brad Pitt in Fight Club.  Pitt was cut and lean in that movie.  My goal is more towards Hugh Jackman in X-Men, Days of Future Past (see the hotel scene when he goes back in time.). Jackman was bulked AND cut."

marriedredpill,3cqvri,Moldy_Gecko,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:15:13 2015 UTC,"I don't find value in ab isolation; the movements are not natural and don't really play into weight lift movements.    The only ab exercises I would endorse would be hanging leg raises and ab-wheels.  HLRs force the abs to work against the legs and support weight in a natural way; liting one's legs is a normal movement.  Ab-wheels contract the abs on the concentric (wheel towards legs) but force it to maintain contraction on the eccentric (wheel away from legs) movement to keep the body stable.  This is also a very natural use of the abdominals.    Outside of that, Squats and deadlifts tend to incorporate the abs in very natural and functional ways.    Everything else won't hurt you, but I can't say they help much either.    As for ab size... why?  These aren't muscles that become more useful with hypertrophy (the size would hinder full range of motion.). I won't tell you what you find value in, but I would focus on hypertrophy for the large muscle groups and focus on strength for the abs and the big 4 (or big 5 if you do BB rows.)    Personal anecdote: my abs have never been stronger than when I was doing BJJ 3 times a week.  I can't wait to get back to it!"

We are close to the same size and age (I'm 6'3"", 195 lbs, he's probably a similar weight when he leans out), and we have a similar build and lift numbers.  We both can pull relatively well on deadlifts and we both suck on bench press (leverages, man, long forearms).  While he's much younger than me, my goal is Steve Weatherford.

Abs don't grow much if at all... this is a matter of genetics, mostly.  So dudes have bigger ones, some don't.  Pitt in fight club looks of a guy with smaller, Weatherford... bigger.  The problem is that types of muscle fibers that abdominals are made of.  They are mostly type two fast-twitch fibers and those don't grow much because they need to be able to move fast.  Secondly, the muscle mass itself, if grown too large, would impede the internal organs which they are there to protect.    There is a sheath covering the ab wall.  Some guys have a thin sheath, some have a thicker sheath.  This is what mostly determines what your abs will look like.  My guess is you have a thicker sheath which tends to flatten and contain the muscle mass.    I know you want bigger abs, but they aren't going to change much from what you are now.  As for weatherford... well, he's about 8% body fat, so his abs show better than someone with 12% BF"

I understand that ab shape is determined by tendons, luckily I'm fairly symmetrical.   12% BF   Did you just call me a fat fuck?  I'm almost insulted, lol.  When I hit 12% (I did get up to 13% last February on a bulk, I was a fat mess but strong as hell and just kept eating my way to new PRs, took 2 months of cutting to get back down to 8%), its time to cut again.

You will lose fat evenly all over, but your genetics dictates where you store it more.  Keep doing what you are doing and it will go away.  My opinion on the program:  I don't like it.    All programs, in my opinion need the following: Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Overhead Press (bonus points for Pendlay Rows.). Everything else in any program is accessory to these 4 (or 5) main exercises.    Some guys say, ""I don't care about strength, I just want to get big.""    That's fine, but you would progress faster on the latter when you increase the former and vice-versa; they compliment each other.  Strength is a direct correlation to muscle cross section:  All things begin equal, the bigger a muscle, the stronger a muscle.  By training raw strength (fiber/neuron activation) you can allow a muscle to get bigger because the increase in raw strength allows faster progression on the high-rep hypertrophy work.    This is why raw strength development in the big 4 (or 5) is so important.  Once strength is increased in those main exercises, the high-rep accessory work gets better."

Also, bad knees from my time in the Marine corps.  That being said, I don't mind assisted alternatives to those exercises.  Also, I do body squats with a medicine ball that I throw at peak.    Not sure What the pendlay rows are.  I've only ever worked out on my own.    Can I ask what you don't like about my workout?  A reason I have it set up that way is it shortens my workout (only have time for an hour) and it gives me a cardio workout.  I stole the style from some time I did crossfit."

Everything else in any program is accessory to these 4 (or 5) main exercises.   Not to say it's bad, I just don't like it; anything is better than nothing.  the big 4 (or 5) are compound movements.  As for the leg work, I get the knee issue... I cam out of the corps unscathed, but I know plenty who have joint issues.  That said, you don't avoid work for an injury... you work around it.  Try smith machine squats or leg presses to supplement the BW stuff.  Do rack pulls instead of deadlifts (less knee work.)  This is a Pendlay Row:"

I've never done 1RM on any of this because I don't have a partner in case of failure.  I was just following someone's advice on here (I thought you).  You suggested these exercises last time, so I've only done them once thus far.  As far as the weight, I choose what I can handle, not sure what it relates to 1RM.  As far as the reps, I thought you suggested switching it up."

You don't need to do 1 RM to find it... You just have to do a weight that brings you to failure in less than 10 reps (ideally ~5) and then we can calculate it.  Once we have that we use 90% of your calculated 1 RM and make that your ""Training max.""  I can build a program based on a very good template with some changes for any limitations you have... But we need 1 RM numbers for reference for the following exercises:   Squat (or squat smith) Deadlift (id like you to try rack pulls instead) Bench press overhead press Pendlay rows (optional)   ""Definition"" is a matter of fat loss.  ""Shape"" is achieved through hypertrophy (muscle growth.). You bulk for a cycle to grow and the. Cut back to see the results (read up on bulk-cut cycles yourself.)  The program I have will build growth, but part of it involves the big 4 mentioned above.  Getting strong (strength skill) in those 4 exercises makes doing the isolated hypertrophy work easier.  Bigger muscles from the hypertrophy makes the strength building easier.  Let me know about the questions and I can put a template for you together."

I'd almost wager that an LTR today was legally about where marriges were 15 years ago, from a legal standpoint. I wouldn't even be surprised if we start seeing alimony cases sprining up from it.  Hell, I work for the RCN, and it got bad, because by canadian law, you are common law after 6 months living together. the CAF had to get an exception, because situations were coming up where a girl would live in a guys place, he goes off on a six month deployment, comes back married...  Could you imagine? It's like squatters rules. Either way, I find my situation as a 7 year LTR to be almost identical in every way to a married guy... the only differences being the cheaper separation process... but the mortgage is in both our names, so it's not like you just pack a bag and grab a suite at the hilton while looking for new places"

Man's social instinct:  state now X, desired future state Y, take action, include helpful allies.   Woman's social instinct: take everybody's opinion into consideration and gain consensus, and gain status by achieving or forcing apparent consensus.

I make sure to budget time to play with him regularly. Wife instead says she gets bored and doesn't know how to play with him. Guess who is the fun parent?

It was awesome and gigantic, with eyes and 4 wings. Nothing like having Son scream ""COW PLANE"" as Wife tries to pick a fight to really communicate that we don't give a fuck about her stupid crap.

Depending on the situation and time of the day, Dread can be to take son to the park to kick a ball, then get some icecream together. Some other times Dread is me going out for beers, or just hanging out with friends.  The key is to understand is that Dread is not just making her jealous of other women. That is part of it, but not the whole thing. The key is to make her understand without words you got a wonderful life going for yourself in all areas, and she is lucky to be part of it. You have to demonstrate in all areas your amazing life.  Heck, I've done dread just going to the hardware store to choose materials for small home improvement projects.

It's by far the best pick-up scenario I have.  I once told my wife of a woman throwing herself at me when I took our son to the playground one day.  Flirting with unsupervised dads seems to happen a lot, but this interaction was really over the top.  So much, that I found it creepy.  I told my wife this as a funny story.  It turns out my wife overlapped social circles with the woman and knew her.  She was a former wild-and-crazy out-clubbing-every-weekend woman.  Her overweight husband had been cheating on her recently.  With that background info, my wife didn't find my funny story at all funny.  A couple years later, she still asks me every few months when I've last run into the woman around town.  When I first found MRP, I got separated from my wife on a ski area shuttle bus.  I was with our daughter and she was with our son.  They went in the rear door and were sitting ~10 rows behind us.  My wife had never noticed how over the top ""helpful"" and ""friendly"" lots of women are to dads out alone with their daughter.  Her - ""Who were they?""  Me - ""I dunno.""  Her - ""Did they know each other?""  Me - ""Nah.""  Her - ""What were you talking about with them?""  Me - ""Mostly skiing.""  Her - ""Why did it seem like both of them were coming on to you the entire ride?""  Me - ""Ehhh, that's normal.  Women just do that when I go out with the kids alone.

Dressing nice and working out really don't impact the kids negatively right?   Going somewhere and she's a stick in the mud? Take the kids with you.   Or don't. I see my kid enough and spend enough time with her that me going to BJJ or to fish with a buddy, or watch a game at a sportsbar would just be...normal.   The first time I had to get out as my wife was just 6 levels of not nice , she called to tell me my kid was sad and crying I wasn't there for ONE bedtime. Made me realize how unused to me being there she was. Had to explain to her that daddy has friends, too and goes out occasionally. Really indicated that I wasn't getting out ENOUGH if once in two weeks just messed up her world.   You don't want to teach them that a dad just sticks around when mommy treats him like an asshat.

That will get transferred to my daughter and she will treat her husband in the future like a little pussy to. That's 4 unhappy lives because I have not set myself straight to at least stop it in MY circle of influence.

Cant just dip out to the gym and bring him with me, so I typically workout during lunch or before they wake up.

But the sex did drop and again sometimes you need to take a hard look in the mirror and own it. After my 2nd round of sex with my wife she takes a shower with me, starts gushing over how good im looking. Then we do some errands and i tell her hey im buying a new workbag for myself, maybe a nice canvas or leather bag, to which she replies you would look so hot with a new bag. Hot over a new bag is what this woman said...lol. I am realizing it was me, the way i dressed, carried myself.  We had sex thursday nite and fri morning. I planned a date nite and took the lead, planned the restaurant , bar ordered our food ,ordered her drink..like a man should do..i was assertive, i dressed like i was on the cover of gq .

Also, I could be wrong, but your whole mindset seems to miss the point IMHO. It reads like you are 'hacking' your wife, learning tricks to deal with her, and that puts her smack dab in the centre of your life.  TRP is not about her. in fact, she doesn't belong in your life (the way things are now) you don't give me the impression that you've truly absorbed OI, which is usually where the guy looks are her like a freeloading roommate...  you haven't mentioned anything about fitness. do you run? workout? you said you started to eat better, a month into it, but not eating doritos anymore isn't making yourself better, anymore than triage makes people better. What do you do now outside of her? Did you make new friends, find old ones again? Have you started activities away from her? Right now it sound like your only hobby is testing the newest AA line in a shit test, and see if she responds favourably.  took me a second read, but theres two lines in here that really show you're missing the point   asking for BJs with a sense of entitlement, so on).   But one slip, one sign of starting to get lazy/miss days at the gym/whatever, and you would have proved her right and would probably need to start over on a higher difficulty setting   What is this? New guys are going to read this FFS. higher difficulty? This isn't a video game man. OI doesn't care about entitlement, if you want a blowjob, you tell her you want a blowjob... she gives it to you because you're giving tingles, or she doesn't and you don't care either way, because you know if you went out, some girl from your social circle would give it to you if you asked.

Outwardly you may have passed the test with this (ignore) as long as she couldn't see you were at a loss for words.  Obviously inward there is not a frame there yet to pass the test.   without her reeling attacked and without coming across as wimpy, passive aggressive or whatever.   Try giving less fucks.  I can understand what /u/rurpe is getting at with you because the idea of coming to the internet for some real-time problem solving for a shit test that already happened doesn't sound like something the Captain of a ship would do.  What I think should be the standard for all of these ""how do I pass this shit test?"" posts is that the OP goes to the wiki, reads the shit test encyclopedia, then puts in the post an example of how they would have used each method listed in section 5 of the encyclopedia to pass the test.

As far as what the Captain of the ship would do, if we all were really always doing what the Captain of a ship would do, then we wouldn't need these subs, that just seems like a pointless comment.   However, I tend to agree with you about your suggestion about perhaps people who want to know how they did on their test utilize some of the easy-access resources first. People tend to think that their situations are unique, but because AWALT, the situations probably aren't that unique.

You might not have meant it that way, but since it's what she would have done, that's why she reacted the way she did.   That being said, when you fuck up and don't respond the way you know you should have (losing frame, etc.), don't try to 'make up for it' with some bitch move later, just think it through, think what you should have done, and try not to make that same mistake again.

marriedredpill,3cq1gr,Sepean,4,Fri Jul 10 05:12:45 2015 UTC,"You have to correct the bad behavior within a couple of seconds of it happening.  If you come back later and try to fix it, you've already lost because you've fallen into her frame.  The fact is, nothing she does should really bother you that much (at least don't let it show).  She's riding an immense emotional rollercoaster.  You shouldn't be riding it with her.   A general pattern to follow when she loses her shit at you:  Just to look at her while she's going crazy, spend that time thinking about what's really going on (it's not what she's bitching about), and then go about doing what needs to get done.  In this specific case, your pregnant wife just got home with groceries, and you're hungry.  ""Honey, I'm making sandwiches for lunch, we are leaving in about 20 minutes.""  It sounds like she's just going to be bitchy with you no matter what, but that doesn't matter.  When she remembers this interaction, her shitty behavior won't be part of the memory, only your behavior (and how she felt about it) will be.  You want her memory to be that you were the MAN, getting shit done.  This made her feel secure.  None of the verbal diarrhea coming out of her mouth matters, 'cause she's riding the emotional rollercoaster that is marriage."

marriedredpill,3cq1gr,marxistbacon,3,Fri Jul 10 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"I totally second what /u/SexistFlyingPig said. There's no repairing. And just not saying anything is mostly a decent response anyway. When in doubt, just do what you did - shut up and walk away. It's much better than saying something dumb or arguing.  I always think of my slip ups as applying to me in the same way as if my wife was fat. Would I care if she explained how she really wasn't as fat as she looked? No; in fact I'd be more annoyed that she was wasting time on explaining instead of exercising and cutting. Would I care that she was once fat when she struts around her tight little ass? No.  The same with acting beta. It happened. She saw it. You can't undo it. The best way to prove you're alpha is to be alpha next time."

It's not a test. tests objectively have a pass fail aspect to them. I have a post about this from last week.  if you think it's a test, she is the invidulator, and I think it's the wrong way to look at it. My metaphor was running for supreme court... your job is to sit there while a senator berates you for an hour, if you don't lose your cool, you get the job.  Try to really... really simplify this.    is what she is doing outside of your boundries? (e.g. I won't be shit on in my own house) poke fun at the idiocy of it (AA) ignore it (OI) or laugh (OI) think of it like your dog, your daughter, or some neighbour kid was giving you attitude, how would you react? the only reason beta men 'fail' shittests is because they treat their wife like an equal, and thats the wrong approach IMHO.   Fuck patterns, coming back from it, salvaging your honour, or any of that crap. you have shit to do, you're on a schedule.. if she starts mouthing off... your time and attention are valuable, you only give either to something that provides value in your life. A meltdown over cereal does not meet that criteria.  The only catch that most guys have... make sure you actually fill your time with value, otherwise you are devaluing your most precious resource... attention"

She was in the wrong (taking too much time)  You responded by being a nice beta bitch  She rightfully lit into you because:   because you have demonstrated that she is above you because she is overwhelmed and YOU are not leading because she does NOT want a beta blue pill bitch.
marriedredpill,3cq1gr,donandhal16,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"Seems like there should be a ratio. Like a guide on a table saw. You can fail some and you are still ok. My relationship is more like a 99 to 1 ratio, but there are others out there that are more forgiving. You failed, move on, pass the others.  As long as you are passing more than you fail, things will begin to improve."

marriedredpill,3cq1gr,donandhal16,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:25:13 2015 UTC,Are you tracking her cycle?    FUCK YES pregnancy makes a difference.  When a fresh egg implants there is a short term release of testosterone that can make a woman aggressive.  When you are breeding bitches you always keep them away from children for a few days after the breeding and you have to be careful the entire pregnancy.  Human bitches be no different.
marriedredpill,3cq1gr,donandhal16,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:09:19 2015 UTC,"No, I've given up. She's so irregular that it's very difficult. One month it could be ten days, another month it could be 27 days. This month she's on day 35. That combined with nausea and headaches and etc made us think she was pregnant. However, piss test says no. She got blood drawn to make sure.  Point being, it probably was the stress of not knowing if she was pregnant or not, more than anything, that fed into it this time."
marriedredpill,3cq1gr,theultmatecad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:16:22 2015 UTC,"Use the app called Clue. You just keep loging in her moods, sex, etc. The more frequently you add details, the smarter it gets. It works even for irregular woman a bit, as it adapts dynamically. The more irregular, the more data you have to input to for the software to get good at predicting.  You can even set it up to give you discreet warning messages.  With this, i can predict my wife's period better than her. I can even tell when shit tests are coming, and about what, before she opens her mouth. She isn't very regular either."

A real man would have said nothing and made a sandwich or told bitch to hurry and do it for him.  Women are naturally selfish. Machiavellian. When they offer to eat cereal it's a passive aggressive move.   ""I'll just have to eat this shitty lunch because you're so slow...."" This is why she flipped out, as she thought this was your meaning.  Start being a man and order that bitch around. Tell her you are not pleased. It's a woman's desire to please a high value man so start acting like one and knock it off with the "" it's ok babe..I'm cool"" attitude.  Once upon a time I was like this too. Got me cheated on, disrespected and I did tons of housework in addition to making all the money."

A real man would have said nothing and made a sandwich or told bitch to hurry and do it for him.   I realized that to a hammer everything looks like a nail.  Women use words and attitude to convey subtly.  When men use words to simply communicate they can take it as passive aggressive and shitty.

marriedredpill,3cq1gr,ufd,0,Fri Jul 10 10:36:21 2015 UTC,"Imagine yourself as a medieval king with complete control over your kingdom. (Because whether you like it or not all outcomes, good or bad will be attributed to you, even if your wife supported a bad decision). If your woman isn't meeting your needs in the kitchen, you laugh heartily because it is in her own disinterest to displease the king. I mean, she has this golden opportunity to cook a lovely meal for royalty, and she offers you nothing?  Oh well, the king will fend for himself tonight and reconsider his options in the morning (dread game). If she were a man peasant it would be off with his head, but her sweet womanly charm convinces you to give her another chance. It's up to you to let her know how many chances she gets (again, dread)."
marriedredpill,3cq1gr,stonepimpletilists,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:36:43 2015 UTC,I can see the value of this approach if that's what was happening. The fact is though that she was getting ready to cook. I could just see the timing of things that it wouldn't work out and cause her to stress.   But. I like your example ha.
