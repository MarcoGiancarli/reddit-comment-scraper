Because of that, I couldn't find the source for this gif unfortunately. Side-note: IU NOONA PLEASE RELEASE A NEW ALBUM.  Also for those interested, ""Kokoro"" [or こころ (Hiragana)] means heart and ""Doki Doki"" [or ドキドキ (Katakana)] represents the thumping or heavy beating, thus this gif is making OP's heart beat. Also note that Hiragana (ひらがな) tends to be used for native Japanese words whereas Katakana (かたかな in Hiragana, and カタカナ in Katakana) is used for words directly translated from sound in another language. To clarify, Hiragana and Katakana are two Japanese alphabet systems that are similar to eachother, but vastly different from the third system, Kanji."

No this isn't a hate comment more of an over all discussion on what I should do. The post just simply stated the material now is inferior of that of 2014 in ways I think that's true. We had the many classic adorable gifs for 2014. As I previously stated in post I submitted before I'd be interested in submitting daily gifs, webm, videos as a new year resolution. I've doing this all of this for fun not for sake of karma. I also don't want the quality of this sub to go down, and if it takes a lil extra time finding extra adorable gifs I genuinely don't mind.   So...I guess I am asking for the opinion of quantity vs. quality. In reality I could probably do both, but again this isn't about karma it's just me doing something for the sake of doing it.

Davichi was formed in 2008 under MNet and they had not renewed their contract in 2014 working as their own agents, then said they were going to release one more album with Core Contents Media as a goodbye to the fans. However, they released a new album (featuring song Cry Again) on January 20th of 2015 under MMO Entertainment which personally made my cry out in happiness.

For those who haven't seen it, the reason why they're doing cat impressions is because of their song Like a Cat (사뿐사뿐) and are battling to see who is the cutest to the point where you curl your fingers and cringe, what is known as aegyo (애교).
