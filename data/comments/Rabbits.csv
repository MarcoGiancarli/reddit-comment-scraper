We also get cilantro and spinach from time to time.  They are a little picky but many rabbits enjoy a wider variety of greens.  However, stay away from iceberg lettuce."
Rabbits,3dzsru,Serae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:26:29 2015 UTC,"I feed my bun a mixture of parsley, spinach and watercress :)"
Rabbits,3dzsru,Vikaela,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:04:28 2015 UTC,"Kale seems to be the biggest hit with all three of our buns, it's a required staple around here.  They also like parsley, romaine lettuce, and spring mix (random salad stuff).  One of the buns hates spinach, the others don't seem to mind it.  Good luck, if you can make the transition away from pellets to veggies only, you can feed your bun for free all summer with stuff you can readily grow in your own garden (or pots on a balcony).  Our buns love stuff that is fresh from the garden.  edit: mint (different kinds) is another crowd pleaser!"
Rabbits,3dzsru,thirstyross,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:08 2015 UTC,"Parsley, cilantro, and lettuce are my staples. I personally wouldn't worry too much about oxalic acids -- just don't feed too much of the ones high in oxalic acids too much and too often."

Rabbits,3dztaw,Fishy343,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:49 2015 UTC,You shouldn't worry too much about it. Babies get alfalfa because it's fattier and tastier than others. The couple of ounces that they're missing (in current body weight) is no biggie. I'm glad they're both males.
Rabbits,3dztaw,endlessinavictory,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:32:23 2015 UTC,"It's not the end of the world -- they may just be a bit leaner than other bunnies their age. They're getting older so you can stick with what you're doing, or just buy some alfalfa pellets and mix it in to give them some more protein."

Rabbits,3dxfv2,medyomabait,5,Mon Jul 20 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"Yea I think they do it because they are curious of the human. They go like 'what is it human? you bring food? toys for us to destroy?'

Rabbits,3dwfzk,justinegln,16,Mon Jul 20 02:36:46 2015 UTC,"Every other weekend at the Animal Humane Society in Golden Valley, MN, rabbit owners bring their buns for a little social and play time. Put on by the MN Companion Rabbit Society. Started with just a handful of rabbit 8 years ago today and now gets up to a hundred. All rabbits have been fixed and are in good health. A few designated ""bouncers"" (in the black shirts) monitor behavior and break up fights and humping. I've been attending for about a year and a half now with my rabbits and still love it. Never gets old :)"
Rabbits,3dwfzk,thirstyross,6,Mon Jul 20 02:43:43 2015 UTC,Amazing.  I am surprised the buns are well behaved...they must be loving it!
Rabbits,3dwfzk,amavritansky,3,Mon Jul 20 03:25:33 2015 UTC,I've been meaning to attend for a while now. What day does it meet?
Rabbits,3dwfzk,amavritansky,3,Mon Jul 20 13:26:20 2015 UTC,"Sundays from 1-2pm. They also have South St. Paul and Minneapolis locations that meet on Wednesdays, Fridays, and the in between Sundays when it's not at Golden Valley. The others aren't nearly as big as the Golden Valley location, but could be used as a good first time practice for your bun to see how they do. Check out the MN Companion Rabbit Society website (http://mncompanionrabbit.org/) for the full calendar."

Rabbits,3dwq1w,vgr1,4,Mon Jul 20 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"10 week old English Angora doe, with blue eyes which are rare. I had a cage, boyfriend (Henry), and even someone who wanted some of the resulting blue eyed fluff balls.  This is the only photo of her, the breeder was keeping for me until she was old enough to travel. A door was left open and the dog got in.  Another week and she would have been with me. I can't even buy another angora, as almost impossible to find any right now. I'm too upset, annoyed to try to be honest."
Rabbits,3dwq1w,erin_urn,3,Mon Jul 20 04:21:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss, it sounds like you were already very attached to this beautiful bun. You seem to be a very loving, prepared owner so I hope you find your bun someday. Best wishes and I sincerely am sorry for your loss <3"
Rabbits,3dwq1w,Serae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:55:41 2015 UTC,"It goes beyond simply losing the bunny, as I also lost the weeks spent finding the bunny in the first place, organising to have her brought over. So I have to repeat the whole stressful process again.  Involves an interstate trip (8 hours), and a special pet transport company, fuel too expensive to drive there and back."
Rabbits,3dwq1w,susanshoos,2,Mon Jul 20 18:47:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss.  That's a terrible disappointment and an awful way for the bunny to go.

Before I got my furry pal the adoption center wouldn't let me take him due to a error in their system, I was furious and heartbroken. I had only met him once and i was in love. I can only imagine what youre going through.   RIP little fluffy bun xx"
Rabbits,3dwq1w,cornystool,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:33:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly - Don't get caught up with the breed.  When we adopted out two, Simcoe and Opal, I was very much against long haired animals of all kinds. When we walked into the adoption event, Opal stood out because she's part lion head and I thought to myself ""So glad we aren't coming home with THAT bun. She looks like a total bitch"".  We hang with some other buns, and mention to the folks we are looking to eventually adopt 2 total. They go - OH GOOD, we have a bonded pair right here.... And point to Opal. Apparently Simcoe was hiding under a tent.  The GF (now almost-wife) kinda fell for them and we ended up taking them home that day. Opal is now a hardcore daddy's girl, and I love her very much. Simcoe is a shy little bun but when its just us he is fairly adventurous now that we've had em for a while and he love getting pet - on his terms.  (Their names were Maddox and Sophia at the rescue, but those wouldn't do for me :-p )  If you already have one bun, its far less important to find a bun in the breed you prefer and more important to find a bun your current one can bond with."

Rabbits,3dx5ci,a_salty_strudel,3,Mon Jul 20 07:08:30 2015 UTC,"She's likely used to the freedom and is frustrated with the tiny space at night. Is it possible to expand her ""safe"" area with an xpen and bunny-proof appropriately and see if she'll improve her behavior? It sounds like she's getting enough exercise throughout the day if you only cage her at night.  The other option is to put cardboard around the bars so she won't rattle them, but that doesn't solve the noise issue. It may help with the floor destruction though.  See My rabbit keeps me up by consistently chewing his cage bars. How do I make him stop? for more ideas."
Rabbits,3dx5ci,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:26:53 2015 UTC,"My bunny hated his old cage, both the layout and amount of usable space were poor. He's perfectly happy in the new cage.  Did you change the cage layout when you moved or something ?"
Rabbits,3dx5ci,SIrThumperOfFluff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:01:49 2015 UTC,"Luna was the same way for awhile after I started letting her out. She'd tear at her cage bars and I was afraid she'd get a leg stuck between the bars and break it. I got her to stop by putting up a wall(cardboard pieces) around the outside of the cage, turning off the lights, and making sure that no one is hanging out in the room that her cage is in. She would attack the bars for a few minutes, but since she couldn't tell if I was still there, she would stop. She was chewing on the bars and rattling the door because she learned that was how to get my attention. Try making it so Boo can't see or hear you; after a week or two she should get the message again that night time=sleepy human time, not bunny fun time."
Rabbits,3dx5ci,ImperialArtist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"Do you usually put a treat in there when she goes in? Maybe I've been putting her in there too soon, sometimes I keep the TV on to play video games (with headphones). I thought it would be more important to put her in at the same time at night, but maybe the goal is to minimize the light/noise in the room once she's in?"
Rabbits,3dx5ci,ImperialArtist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:30:19 2015 UTC,"I don't give Luna any treats; I just pick her up and sit her fluffy rear down in the cage. Goal is definitely to reduce distractions when she's in her cage for the night. If there's no distractions and she thinks your not there, she aught to start calming down. No use throwing a fit if it doesn't get a reaction, right?"
Rabbits,3dx5ci,philosotea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:01 2015 UTC,"Whenever I visit my parents, my rabbit has more freedom because my bedroom there is completely bunny-proof and he get to run around all day. He used to behave quite the same way when I put him in his cage. He would loudly thump over and over and would knock over/throw his food bowl in protest.  The two things I've did to fix that:  One, save a portion of his dinner (veggies, pellets, whatever he really likes) to give him then so he treats going into the cage as a positive thing.   Second, I drape a sheet over his cage so he can't see out. If he can't see for sure that I'm that and can't see the room he's missing, he doesn't riot."

You may have to eventually concede that Mushi will never be happy about being handled like that. My cinnamon does exactly the same thing whenever I try to pick her up (after 4 years together).   That said, you may just need to give him more time to adjust to living with you guys. Picking up a rabbit is one of the most terrifying situations a rabbit can be in because he is a prey animal and predators pick up rabbits. Rabbits are evolved to be able to run and hide, which you need to be on the ground to do, and when you pick up Mushi he has absolutely no control of the situation.   It requires a lot of trust and familiarity for a rabbit to be okay with that situation, and on top of being a prey animal living in/being raised in a house where he was either abandoned or allowed to escape from can leave some significant mental trauma. Sometimes, like with my cinnamon, that trauma can't be overcome, but hopefully it can with time in your case. It may take many months for you to build up the trust and relationship for him to be comfortable with picking him up, though."
Rabbits,3dvuz2,lordzeon,3,Mon Jul 20 00:06:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I feel much more reassured knowing it's normal for this to happen.  I've had rabbits before, when I was a kid, and they've always been okay with being picked up, but we also had them since they were young.  I guess I just need to be very patient with him!"
Rabbits,3dvuz2,improperlycited,3,Mon Jul 20 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"Recognize that rabbits are prey animals.  In nature, if a rabbit is EVER picked up it is because it is about to be eaten.  That is literally the only result. The only hope is for them to escape. Even for domesticated rabbits, that instinct to start kicking as a last-ditch effort to stay alive is deeply ingrained.    Rabbits can learn to be picked up, but it is absolutely teaching them to ignore their instincts.  Realizing that can really help."
Rabbits,3dvuz2,ezirb7,3,Mon Jul 20 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's definitely normal. I've had gimli since he was just weaned off of his mother, and he has had nothing but close care and snuggles. He never even had a painful nail clipping experience until this month.   He will tolerate being picked up when he can't easily get away, but will thump or kick out once he's on the ground, so we avoid it when it's not necessary."
Rabbits,3dvuz2,cocodaloco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:52:52 2015 UTC,Do you have advice for how to cut his nails then?
Rabbits,3dvuz2,killermachi,3,Mon Jul 20 10:41:23 2015 UTC,"I would suggest laying on the floor with him and getting on his level...that's how I got my bun to trust me now she cuddles on the couch and on the floor. She trusts me enough to pick her up....but still hates it. I usually only do it if necessary and hold her as close as possible, always supporting the fluffy bum as holding the wrong way can lead to bad things. And making sure all paws are touching me...which inevitably leads to clawing me."
Rabbits,3dvuz2,sinray,4,Mon Jul 20 04:57:53 2015 UTC,"At least he hops onto your laps! My dwarf only does that if we offer her blueberries, and even then she doesn't stay there for very long. And don't even think about picking her up, unless you want to hear lots of thumps and get a lot of foot flicks directed at you.   My hope for you is that at some point, he'll allow you to put your hands on each side of his body and not freak out, at which point you would be able to give him treats immediately after to condition him to like it. So hold him like you're about to pick him up but don't actually pick him up, and if he's calm give him a treat. It's worth a shot!  Important note: if you ever attempt to pick him up, you HAVE to finish it and pick him up and ONLY let go once he's calm. If you let him go while he's trashing, he'll learn that the best way to escape being picked up is to fight against it as hard as he can."
Rabbits,3dvuz2,detective_peanut,3,Mon Jul 20 01:49:57 2015 UTC,"I have 2 rabbits and 2 more foster buns awaiting adoption. Molly the bun we have had the longest hates being picked up and has since we got her from a rescue 18 months ago, but the other 3 have at the very least tolerated being held. Molly will kick and buck the moment you put two hands on her. we originally tried to get her use to be handeled when we first got her but she never got any better so we just let her be. She is very affectionate but it is all on her terms, if she doesn't want to be picked up that is cool with us, we are not children and just love her company."

This story is making its way around FB currently (Victoria, Canada):  ""Met Morpheus (A New Zealand meat rabbit rescue) and his waif-like owner Kara, a dirty, dishevelled young girl maybe 18, 19-years old, begging on the streets of Victoria. Runaway for sure. What struck me was her concern for her bunny. She had water for him but not herself and she had plucked dandelion from a park to keep him fed but had run out of pellets because of cost. She said if she could get some money she could buy art supplies so she could sell stuff and they could both have a little more. I know many, many kind people but this reverberated to the core of my being. Whatever I had on me was hers but Lord knows that is not nearly enough. I am not a religious man but I will ask the universe to look out for Kara and Morpheus and give them the break they need. I can't and don't want to find more deserving souls just right now."" - ref"

Rabbits,3dvbpd,flashblazer,2,Sun Jul 19 20:45:40 2015 UTC,Go to a rescue that will let you return the bunny if the bonding really isn't going well.   Does their breeds and/or ages make a big difference in them getting along?   No.
Rabbits,3dvbpd,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, I keep seeing pictures of them, and im looking specifically for a mini lop :). Are they like netherland dwarves? In the fact that they dont grow to be big? I went to get a mini rex at first and that name was misleading >< they were not as ""mini"" as i had expected. haha"
Rabbits,3dvbpd,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:12:47 2015 UTC,"If you want small bunnies, look for the dwarf breeds -- lionhead, netherland dwarf, holland lop, polish, etc.  If you wait long enough, lops are pretty common in rescues in my experience. There's lots of breeders for the dwarf breeds.  Mini lops are regular sized rabbits. However, if you want the easiest bond for your bunny, I wouldn't really set your heart on looks and go with whatever personality meshes best with your current bunny.  http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Breeds"
Rabbits,3dvbpd,improperlycited,2,Mon Jul 20 03:52:37 2015 UTC,"Is there a chance i'd get lucky and they'd bond right away?   When looking for a little buddy for Pretzel, I took him to the humane society and introduced him to 8-10 different rabbits.  He didn't get along with most of them (I started to get worried) but finally I introduced him to Triscuit and they got along.  Sort of.  He started humping her face, but she seemed OK with it and then they were fine.  That was the one I went with, and they ended up getting along famously.  Several years later, Triscuit died and I had to go through the process again.  I did the same thing and again had good success.  I think the key is that you shouldn't try to choose the other rabbit... Let your rabbit choose.  Arranged marriages can work, but it works better when they can choose their own mate."
Rabbits,3dvbpd,eatyourspinach,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:27:40 2015 UTC,"I totally understand your worries. I adopted a female mini lop (full grown, 4 lbs) to bond with my adopted male Holland lop (full grown, 3 lbs), and it took a good five months for me to trust them alone together, but they are best buddies now. They happen to be the same age, but bunnies really aren't picky. I wouldn't suggest getting a senior bun to bond with a young one, though, since they do grieve when their mate dies. Bunnies aren't picky about sizes either, but I wanted two smallish bunnies due to lack of space here and the fact that my Holland is so tiny, I didn't want a huge bunny overpowering him.   Let your current bunny go on ""dates"" (Humane Society is great, but I used Craigslist) and see who is the best match. Fighting is a bad sign, so even if you like the new bunny, don't get it if your current rabbit doesn't like it. Male+female pairings are generally easiest as long as they're both fixed. In general, one bunny will decide to be the submissive one, and the other will be dominant. So if they're fighting, it's because they both want to be dominant. Two submissive bunnies is just fine. What to look for at the first ""date"": indifference, friendliness, grooming, relaxed behavior, a little bit of humping is okay, but NOT chasing/fighting/circling/aggression of any sort.   My male thought he was dominant at first, but the new female quickly corrected that, and he's cool with it. She grooms him more, he puts his head down, she humps him from time to time, but I push her off after a few seconds. I don't let them fight at all (separating them with loud noises, water spray bottles, towels thrown over them, etc, but not with your hands). If you have neutral territory in your house, that's best to use for bonding. I don't, and it still worked out in the end. They actually just spent the last three nights together without any complications :) Good luck!"

Rabbits,3dszqq,Solleret,3,Sun Jul 19 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"We took Timber speed dating today, and he chose this much younger lady. She is part of a litter that was born in the rescue on Valentine's day, and her name is Skeddaddle (we may change it).   I am a little anxious about having a much younger bun bonded to our 4 year old, but the rescue said that rabbits raised among other rabbits can be very accepting and helpful to anxious, once-abused buns like Timber. Also, the size difference is too cute.  She is very young and outgoing, and Timber is the shy one here. No biting or humping so far, he just runs away when she tries to give him attention. They spent about 3 hours together at the shelter without incident, and they were grooming themselves, eating, and generally relaxed.  Right now Timber is recovering from his Big Day, and trying to make us feel guilty for not putting him back into his Bun Castle. Skeddaddle is chewing up her cardboard box and chowing down on some hay.  Fingers crossed!"

Rabbits,3dskqc,SIrThumperOfFluff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:29:48 2015 UTC,"Not so different from other bunnies.   The Internet will tell you that their ears require extra cleaning and that their toes require frequent trimming (so they don't shred their ears), but I feel like those things may apply more to people who keep them in hutches outdoors.  I cleaned her ears once when she first came home, but they've not needed it since. Her toes need to be trimmed no more often than my flemish's.   In terms of personality, she is sweet, sociable, and not afraid of anything. Our Flemish is similar though, so it's tricky to tell what's nature vs nurture."

Rabbits,3dsthi,KniveVideos,3,Sun Jul 19 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"Can you check inside his ear to make sure he doesn't have mites? It seems like he's itching it quite excessively. If it looks like his ear has lots of dirty specks in it, I would go to the vet to get it checked out.  http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Grooming#Cleaning_ears  If it's an open wound, I'd use some Betadine to disinfect. If it's just a surface rash, then I'd put some plain diaper rash cream to help with itching in the meantime.  http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/First_aid_kit_for_rabbits#Wound_care  If the itching has been going on for weeks, then I'd definitely go to the vet regardless. Hope it's nothing too serious!"
Rabbits,3dsthi,sneaky_dragon,2,Sun Jul 19 04:33:49 2015 UTC,Vet can look down further in their ear with a scope than we can see so I would pop him down to a vet and ask them to check for mites just in case

The carpet scraps are mainly for your rabbit to entertain itself by digging. If you have actual carpet in your house then I wouldn't recommend getting it.   Make sure to supervise her if she's never played with carpet before to make sure she's not eating it. If she is, then don't let her play with the carpet at all.

Rabbits,3dqvoj,Minniebunny,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:57 2015 UTC,Haha! I've been using wabbitwiki's list of acceptable veggies/plants for all my gardening ideas.   It's very helpful because it even lists the species names so I can make sure I'm getting a safe plant.
Rabbits,3dqvoj,Minniebunny,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:40:19 2015 UTC,Thanks very much. I am going to check it out:)
Rabbits,3dqvoj,RoseOfSharonCassidy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:12:59 2015 UTC,I just printed out the list and took it with me when I went seed/plant shopping in Spring. :) There are quite a few things you could grow for them that will grow well in Fall weather too! I might try my hand at growing some spinach or something for them when it gets closer to the end of Summer.  If you want something that grows aggressively - the peppermint (Mentha × piperita) I planted grows like a weed and they love it. I have to trim it every few days because it grows so fast.
Rabbits,3ds6z2,henningcats,8,Sat Jul 18 23:11:14 2015 UTC,"Can you shop around with other rabbit-savvy vets in the area and get more quotes for an amputation? I think $2k is on the high end of a rabbit leg amputation. Another idea is to reach out to any local rabbit rescues and see if they have any vet discounts and recommendations that can help you with the cost. I'm very sorry to hear about Bean, and I don't have much for advice for the situation.  Pinging /u/kinenchen as she has a couple of Flemish Giants and might have more ideas on treatment."
Rabbits,3ds6z2,sneaky_dragon,7,Sat Jul 18 23:38:48 2015 UTC,It does seem steep. I asked some colleagues what they've been charged and I'll let you know what I hear. Large rabbits are usually easier to anesthetize than smaller ones.
Rabbits,3ds6z2,kinenchen,5,Sun Jul 19 02:08:34 2015 UTC,Two folks report they were charged $1500 so it's not totally insane to see $2000. I wish I had better news. :/ EDIT: others reported $600 and $650 respectively. I think a second opinion is an order.
Rabbits,3ds6z2,kinenchen,4,Sun Jul 19 05:02:22 2015 UTC,Ouch. I asked someone that had experience with the local rescue costs and he said $700-1000. But he did say that it depended if there was pre-operation tests and stuff which might bump the price higher.
Rabbits,3ds6z2,sneaky_dragon,4,Sun Jul 19 06:34:02 2015 UTC,That is a really tough choice and i'm sorry you're going through this :( I personally would amputate. Is there anyway the vet would maybe work out a payment plan with you? Or maybe CareCredit?
Rabbits,3ds6z2,adriCat,4,Sun Jul 19 01:51:21 2015 UTC,"The cost does seem high like /u/sneaky_dragon posted. The Rabbit Haven took in a girl a bit over a year ago and needed her front leg amputated .. ""Surgical cost range 600-800"".    Here is a post, I remembered a post from a rescue (Rabbitats on fb group 'Disabled Rabbits'), that talks about a Flemish and front leg issues.. ""The trick was a looooong course of the right combination of antibiotics, which in this case seems to be the daily PenG injection and oral Zithromax.""  Might be info for your vet... Good luck!!  edit: text paste of post"
Rabbits,3ds6z2,vgr1,3,Sun Jul 19 03:41:27 2015 UTC,I am so sorry you have to make such a hard decision. I am going along with what /u/Adricat said and wondering whether your vet has a payment plan if you decided to amputate? Best wishes to you and your lovely bunny.
Rabbits,3ds6z2,Minniebunny,3,Sun Jul 19 08:56:48 2015 UTC,"Goddamn, amputating a hind leg only cost me 200 euro in the Netherlands. Are all your vets driving around in gold plated SUVs or something? I don't understand where these prices are coming from!  What I'm worried about is that the abscess might recur, which is very common, even if they've completely disappeared at one point. The fact that he had two in the same spot on both front legs when he's still so young makes me wonder if there isn't an underlying cause for these abscesses. If there is, they will definitely recur in the remaining leg, which will already be more vulnerable because it carries more weight, at which point you'd have to put him to sleep after all, and you'll have a giant bill with nothing to show for it.   I had the issue with an abscess recurring in a rabbit's jaw, I treated it several times and it seemed cured every time, but it kept coming back and in the end the abscess had eaten away at his lower jawbone to the point of breaking. So if you haven't had one made yet, I suggest getting an X-ray to see what the bone and joint on the ""healthy"" leg looks like, it might make your decision easier, even if it's not a happy one :/  I'm sorry you have to deal with this and hope for the best outcome."

Rabbits,3dt8vv,Rae_Starr,2,Sun Jul 19 05:59:58 2015 UTC,Wait another couple of weeks before trying to bond. Just swap their pens for now and have them get used to each other's scents. It can take up to 4 weeks before all their hormones dissipate.  Males with hormones can be extremely aggressive.
Rabbits,3dt8vv,sneaky_dragon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:31:16 2015 UTC,So this isn't unusual?  I just feel so hopeless.
Rabbits,3dt8vv,sneaky_dragon,2,Sun Jul 19 06:41:27 2015 UTC,"Nope. Take a break and relax as well. The bunnies can sense your stress when bonding and tend to get agitated as well.  Boys can be very hard to bond, but if there's short periods where they're content to just chill nearby, there's hope."
Rabbits,3dt8vv,ChatPolice,2,Sun Jul 19 07:38:56 2015 UTC,"We JUST were able to get Carson and Stanley bonded. Both males, one is young and one is old. It took 2 months.   Cage Location: We started with having their cages and food next to each other so they had to eat while looking at each other through the bars.   Stress Bonding: We did some stress bonding by putting them both together in a laundry basket on top of the dryer for 20-30 minute sessions. At first, I sat in there with them to make sure that they weren't killing each other but the noise and vibrations from the dryer made them cuddle together. We did this every couple days for about a month.   Swapping Items: I moved the toys, litter boxes, etc. around so that they got used to each others scents.  Forced Cuddling: We would put both of them on the couch side by side and then just pet them for a bit. Once we stopped petting them, we would see how they would react. At first, Stanley kept trying to bite Carson but after a few weeks, he calmed down and realized that Carson isn't a threat.  Food Incentives: We would take some blueberry and rub it on Carson's head to encourage Stanley to groom him. We didn't do this until they could sit next to each other without killing each other though.   Voice Guidance: When we would put them together, I used my voice to discourage Stanley from being aggressive. If they were being good, I would talk softly and say ""Good bunnies! You're being good!"" When they started getting aggressive, I would raise my voice and say ""Be nice!"" I wasn't shouting but speaking loudly and firmly. This was usually enough to startle Stanley into looking at me and forgetting about biting Carson.   Obviously every rabbit and pairing is different. Just watch for signs of aggression and break up fights ASAP. Little nips are fine but not hard bites. And be patient as it can take a while! Good luck!!"

It might be worth separating the panels about 2-3 inches or more instead with NIC panels as bunnies can usually stick their whole nose through it pretty far. And I'd recommend having an easy to clean floor covering as the poop and urine messes will be... plentiful. :X  Best of luck with bonding!

Rabbits,3dp22t,kittymonger,2,Sat Jul 18 02:16:23 2015 UTC,I always thought you should wait a bit longer around 2 - 4 weeks to start bonding to ensure all hormonal issues calm down. This is why I have waited a month to get Odin bonded.
Rabbits,3dp22t,MarshmallowShy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:19:43 2015 UTC,Someone else on here said it could take 8 weeks for hormones to dissipate. I tried putting them together 3 days after his neuter and they were doing ok. So this is about 4 days into their bonding. I put them in the same cage yesterday for 3 hours to see how they do. They did great so they spent all night in there together. No issues. Might be one of the easiest bonds ever? There has been only a little bit of grooming that I have seen.After the first two days I was able to pretty much not supervise  them like a hawk. They are currently playing in a box together in the living room.
Rabbits,3dp22t,Mastershroom,2,Sat Jul 18 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you just luck out and get a pair that naturally bonds with no effort. We had Oreo (who is a spitting image of your bun on the left, by the way!) for a few months before we adopted Donut...on our way home with Donut, we bought a whole new cage so they could each have their own distinct territories if they needed time away from each other.  Well, we came home, set up Donut's new cage, and let them both out on the carpet to meet each other. Long story short, they sniffed each other for like 30 seconds and then both hopped into Oreo's cage, and Donut started grooming Oreo's head. They've been inseparable ever since :)"
Rabbits,3dp22t,Mastershroom,2,Sun Jul 19 00:33:42 2015 UTC,Hope you were able to return the cage! That is an awesome bond! Luckily we just used my dog's old crate to house him. Broke it down again for storage this morning and to get it out of the kitchen dining nook. I was worried his recent neuter would be too much but decided to try them out sooner since they were both being so calm through the cage that first bonding day.  I saw them grooming each other this afternoon so I think we are completely good to go. Just had dinner pellets with no squabbles.

Rabbits,3dphct,vgr1,3,Sat Jul 18 04:48:40 2015 UTC,That's just awesome! Do you know why it walks like that?
Rabbits,3dphct,Minniebunny,3,Sat Jul 18 06:05:59 2015 UTC,"There are a number of ""stories"".... From the yt comment: ""It was born with problems in its rear legs, which made it impossible to walk or run like others.""   Another story about it: “We thought that perhaps the rabbit had damaged its back legs,” zoo spokesman Xiong Shao told AustrianTimes.at, “but when it isn’t walking on its hind legs the two back legs seemed to work perfectly. It doesn’t seem to be in any pain so there is no reason for it to walk like this, it can’t be easy. We are completely baffled as it was too young really to have been taught any tricks, and whoever heard of teaching rabbits to walk on their front legs?”"

I too am a new bunny owner, and in about two weeks I got her litter trained and more used to handling. Make sure you let your bunny out often and be around her at all times. Because you will never know when your bunny will find a surprise hiding place lol. To get him/her to be more trusting with handling and petting I learned you will have to be with your bunny for a least an hour, on the floor. As it moves about, the bunny will return to you every couple of times and eventually, could be days, weeks, maybe (hopefully not) months until it will be more calm around you. Good luck with the new baby!!"

Oddly, she died the same day as Professor Mick Aston (the lead archaeologist on the show) passed away.
