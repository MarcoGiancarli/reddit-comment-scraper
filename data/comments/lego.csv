Its a smaller store and they don't have a lot of shelf space, they said that when they run out of stock on the big sets the display boxes stay up as a place holder as a way to remember the set will need shelf space when its back in stock, otherwise, it will never make it back on to the shelf.  They will move the display box to a top shelf, as they are always trying to cram as many sets as they can anywhere they can, yeah its easy to make room for smaller sets, but not the big ones.

lego,3dvdho,Hotsaltynutz,4,Mon Jul 20 07:35:34 2015 UTC,"Having watched the movie a few times, I really wish they'd left that scene out--it almost makes me think that the studio insisted on it to give the audience a sense of closure.  The whole point of the movie is that faith and science are flip sides of the same coin--each represents mankind's search for truth. Jodie Foster has been a stolid skeptic and believes that science can answer all of life's questions, but when she returns, she has no evidence to support her profound and almost spiritual encounter with the alien/dad and asks the board to take her word ""on faith"". Realizing that there is room in science for faith is what completes her character arc, but the scene about the hours of static destroys the ambiguity of her experience--and by extension, the movie--by tipping the scales back towards science."
lego,3dvdho,JimmyLegs50,4,Mon Jul 20 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"Its based on a book, written by Carl Sagan. That scene is in the book just like the movie.  I prefer they left the book intact as much as possible in this case rather than change it just for the movie."

As u/rprebel posted above you can find instructions to it on rebrickable or my website (http://jkbrickworks.com/hoberman-sphere/).  I never put together instructions for the stand unfortunately.  It is a pretty part intensive build, using a lot of technic axles and axle connectors. Probably easier to swap colors before hitting bricklink.  I took a picture of a minifig dude inside it while it was spinning, which you can see here: http://imgur.com/MoI2bIo  I totally dropped the ball by not putting a Jody Foster look alike minifig inside, but this model has now long since been disassembled."

It's got a great piece count, play features, love that cockpit design and the figures are pretty neat too (save for mauls yandere face). I do think that the price point and the overall build as well as the time of this sets release isn't really doing it any good."

I like the ship, but not enough to buy a Lego version of it, much less four of the damn things in minfig scale.  I'd venture a guess this one won't do too well, with the TFA stuff around the corner, and it being so similar to the 2011 build at a crazy price."

lego,3dzcpa,bogaboy,4,Mon Jul 20 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell just from the listings.  Obviously the ones that are designs not put out by LEGO are easy enough to see.  Otherwise, you'll just have to look very closely at the figures.  Depending on which third-party seller you are dealing with, the features vary (faces, front/back printing, quality of print, etc.).  I would compare the faces if you can to those on bricklink.  I tend to see a lot of variation there.  Quality is hit or miss.  I own several knock-offs.  Mainly, I can't do the House Party Protocol with the few Iron Man suits LEGO gives us.  Also, I don't want to shell out more than $10 for a single figure and certainly not 100s or 1000s that some sellers ask for SDCC exclusives.  I don't mind the quality.  Most of mine are printed fine (I think two or three errors in the 20+ that I have).  Some have joints that are too weak or too tight.  Hair/helmets can be a pain to get off.  Some hands drop things too easily.    I guess that if you really want to protect yourself, try asking the sellers for images of the product you'll get with the LEGO logo visible."

lego,3dzcpa,danger_lad,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:10 2015 UTC,It seems like  a lot of the knock off listings on the eBay UK site try to avoid specifically saying Lego. So they'll be described as 'lego like' or 'brick toys' etc. I have a couple and they're decent for the price. I've got a legit Star Lord and a knock off Star Lord. Do you want a comparison picture?

lego,3du322,TargetBoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:45:02 2015 UTC,"That's really awesome. I don't know why Space-related themes over the last couple decades weren't as popular as the first two.  It seems like they would appeal to kids more than they did.  I don't know.  I know quite a few people enjoyed them.  They just don't have the same type of enthusiastic fan base.  I went to Brickfair VA last year and Galactic Enforcer came up in an auction for charity.  It barely sold for a little over the original retail price.  The auctioneer practically begged for bids.  Out of everything sold, that was the one that was most surprising to not go for much more than the fair market value.  People were over-bidding on most items, just because it was for charity.  The reason I didn't bid on it was because I was still relatively new to the hobby as an AFOL and not familiar enough with the set at the time.  It was also one of the first items that went up for sale.  I didn't want to spend that much money so early in the auction when I knew there would be items coming up that I really wanted.  I regret it now though.  It's a great set.  It's a shame it didn't do better.  It must be tough being a Lego designer.  You can't appeal to everyone and people, especially online, can be really harsh.  They can be quite passionate about the hobby, appropriate or not.  I don't know how you can convey an essence that Classic Space once was in a new, modern design.  I mean, sure, you can come up with models like Peter Reid does and Benny's Spaceship.  And, honestly, a whole modern theme like that would be amazing.  But to design something that's entirely new, that isn't based on a classic design, and still invoke the same excitement, that's got to be tough."

lego,3du322,CookMark,8,Mon Jul 20 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"Exploriens were popular but the start of expensive Legos. I recall when they came out and seeing them being more than ones in the past. I'm an avid space collector and really the series died off with Spyrus and Roboforce. Those were the last legit space models with people. UFO was quite popular but no humans and from there I can't recall anything else except when Mars came out and the new Space Police which is nothing like the old. The reason I found for this was Star Wars. Why have large competing space sets when Star Wars is just that with never ending models whereas with space themes you'd have to keep coming up with something new design. Star Wars killed space which sucks because I really collected those and still do,  the few I'm missing. I'm a huge Star Wars fan, have all the original Legos, but I miss my space sets."

The aliens from this series were pretty much a waste of plastic, but the actual mars mission ships are largely good.  I've got almost all of SP3.  Galatic enforcer is a BIG ship.  The max security transport is good sized.  The Lunar limo bad-guys ship is big.  To me these are as much space themes as any of the classic stuff.  I've got a big chuck of Classic Space, all of blacktron I, most of blacktron II, most of Space Police I, and all of M-Tron to compare this with.   Alien conquest was in the same category as the UFO series for me.   Just wasn't my style, but certainly space.  Galaxy Squad was all space, but time/finances made me skip that one.  Personally I want to see more space like the Exo-suit that harkens back to the opponent-less classic space, but Lego has by no means been ignoring space themes."

These sets in these themes are generally much larger and there are more Space Police 3 sets then either Space Police 1 or 2, or then M-Tron, Blacktron, in fact almost everything except for classic space. It also ran for 2 and a half years which is longer then all previous space themes except classic space.  Also these themes were at least partly developed by some of the same designers as the pre-Star Wars space themes.   If it's a LEGO created theme set in space why is it not 'Space'. Are you sure it wasn't you that was smaller? :)  EDIT: BTW, I think OPs collection is awesome and thank you for sharing it online."

Just an amazing job there and almost no supporters :-(  Heh.  Figured I'd submit it again to try to boost it.
lego,3du322,31rhcp,2,Sun Jul 19 23:49:33 2015 UTC,I'm very surprised that doesn't have more support.
lego,3du322,Lego_Nabii,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:06:54 2015 UTC,I may just have to build it.  I've got all the parts.
lego,3du322,TargetBoy,-1,Mon Jul 20 11:25:32 2015 UTC,"13 sets over a year, not even close to 2.5yrs. Blacktron II had 15 over 2 years not to mention they all intertwined so if we're getting technical, that's 31 sets over 3 years. It was a bigger theme, much much bigger theme since they all intertwined and grew with each other with the newer being the bigger badder. It was early 2000's when they started to fade off and Star Wars took over the ideal space theme."
lego,3du322,msx,3,Sun Jul 19 22:56:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, a few of the early themes co-existed, Space Police 1, M-Tron and Blacktron 2 and Space Police 3 all kind of ran into each other. But all the rest stood completely alone and did not overlap (unless some toy shops had old stock on the shelves).  There were 15 sets in Space Police 3, though 1 was a tiny poly bag set, and it was on the market from early 2009 to mid 2011. (Disclosure: I'm pretty certain of these dates as I had a hand in designing 8 of these sets, 6 of them all the way through to the final production model.)  I don't want to argue, I think it's awesome you have great memories of Space LEGO when you were a kid. It's just kind of tough being told my work is not good enough. I spent so much time and effort trying to make them worthy of the Classic Space sets I played with as a kid, even working on them alongside some of the guys who worked on those old themes and hearing the stories about those days, and then you tell me I failed. We tried to make Space, I thought we had, not for you though, Sorry about that."
lego,3du322,lost_in_my_thirties,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"I have all the old ads that used to come that show not only the overlap but the use of them with each other.   I appreciate the newer sets but they're not space,  they're an extension of City I feel just like the astronaut/NASA like sets that came out. I have a few of those too. Space is Star wars, far away, own adventures, but everything now seems so city oriented or one type models like the Exo suit which was by vote. They're cool,  well Mars was, but the Space Police seemed off. Cool sets, didn't care for the theme. Again,  felt too connected to city,  in the future lol. Appreciate your work overall but I guess 90s space is dead and gone forever. The Exo suit gave me hope til I saw it was a one model thing,  like most are these days, and I doubt more will come. Wish I had the money to build my own and expand my theme but judging from that voting site,  people don't want themes,  they want something here and now."
lego,3du322,futtigue,2,Sun Jul 19 23:44:41 2015 UTC,"I don't want to argue, I think it's awesome you have great memories of Space LEGO when you were a kid.   I think this is what causes the problem a lot of people have with the most recent space themes. Those old enough to love old Space sets are blinded by nostalgia. Those young enough to be in the ""recommended age range"" could be more interested in Star Wars.  I don't personally have the desire to collect the newer space lines, but I could also say the same thing about a lot of Classic Space and 80s Space sets that go for a fortune on eBay/BL. The early to mid 90s were when I was young enough to love pouring over LEGO catalogs so it's no surprise that my favourite sets are from Space Police 2 through RoboForce.  For better or for worse, LEGO has changed over the years. Many of the iconic space elements (for example the canopies) are no longer being made. Even Benny's Spaceship, which has references to Classic Space and the same colour scheme is completely different than most old Space sets (pieces used, play features, building techniques, etc.)  The inclusion of alien minifigs makes total sense too since minifig detailing has improved over time and LEGO has become more minifig focused."
lego,3du322,CivilEntgineer,3,Mon Jul 20 07:56:41 2015 UTC,"You're right, there will always be an issue of nostalgia. Something I often remind my self when AFOLs are being harsh about our new themes/sets is that is doesn't matter how well we design a set it is impossible to make them eight years old children again, impossible to re-capture that childhood pleasure of getting and building the set you have been craving for months. We grow up, we change.   However it's very hard to find away to say that to anyone without coming across as a condescending ass. If I came into this thread (a huge nostagia thread full of awesome old products) it would be horrible, and people would justifiably react with anger, if I said 'but the sets of today have more complex building techniques, better figures and have more play features, you only think these are old ones are cooler because you were a kid when they came out' (even if that's inadvertently what I've ended up saying... crap, sorry everyone) you would think I was an asshole. Personally I know nothing I ever do will be cooler then the Galaxy Commander I got when I was eight. Best set ever? It is to me and that's enough. That should be enough for everyone, why argue about what is coolest, we each have our own choice for our own unique reasons.  From my professional side all I can do is make sure that the eight year olds of today desire and get at least as much fun out of the sets I'm involved in designing as I did from the sets back in the eighties."

Maybe the next Lego movie should have a subtle reminder of that in it.  I don't know that it is impossible.  The Exo Suit was pretty far up there for the ""WAAAANT"" feeling again and my son LOVED it, even if it was a bit too fragile for a 4yr old to play with.   From my professional side all I can do is make sure that the eight year olds of today desire and get at least as much fun out of the sets I'm involved in designing as I did from the sets back in the eighties.

And don't you think about future designers? They'll have to cope with the second wave nostalgia caused by YOUR models! Way to make their job harder! :)  Jokes aside, it was a beautiful line. I for one think modern sets are just as cool as older ones. You just need to factor in your 30+ years old inner child to see it. So don't pay attention to the nostalgic and keep making those awesome models :) Btw i love to follow you around here on /r/lego to read all your juicy first-hand insights!  Anyway, i must say that the very first classic space (just the gray/blue, not including mtron, blacktron etc) had a special feeling in that it was somehow more ""realistic"" than other series. Some of those rovers seemed to be taken right out of some Nasa moon rover. The following series were more sci-fi, while CS was more ""science"" to me. It looked more like something from a ""Nasa plans for future space exploration"" than something from star trek or star wars.  At least this is the feeling i got. It it makes any sense."

lego,3du322,TheRedComet,3,Sun Jul 19 20:42:26 2015 UTC,I had so many of these sets growing up and inevitably they all ended up disassembled and stored in giant bins.

lego,3dx4q6,Nokturn_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"I actually have all three of these and had a great time building each. That said, the AT-AT build was fun and looks fantastic standing next to the 75094, from a scale point of view. As people have said, the legs were the only part that I found a bit repetitive, but really the last 2 you build are a breeze.   On a personal level the shuttle was actually a bit more fun as I am a huge fan of the design of the ship to begin with. Its actually a bit larger than I expected and the interior was more interesting to construct, compared to the AT-AT which just has a big open space with a trap door in the center of the body. The middle fin was a bit tedious to construct but at least you don't have to build 4 of them!   So really it boils down to which vehicle you prefer. They are both equally great builds and the end results are satisfying, but both have their strengths and their weaknesses too. Have fun with whatever you choose, you really can't go wrong."

It's really a shame, too, because what makes Lego great is that you can build awesome models out of little pieces that come together to form a plane, or a space ship, or a house or a car, or whatever you want.

lego,3dxyte,LegoLinkBot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:06 2015 UTC,"It depends on how far back you want to go. Are you thinking pre 90's or after? Mid 90's is when Lego really started changing things up   The really old sets are pretty simple in build with either one large flat baseplate or built on several with sides that open up. One of my favorites is 6085, Black Monarchs castle. I absolutely love the figures, there are a ton of them as well, and the castle color (Black) looks amazing.  6081 and others that use that raised baseplate are great simply because they are different from the standard design. I really like Kings Mountain Fortress, the minifigures are great and there are plenty of them included. The design of the 'castle' is pretty simple but works great as a fort.   6086 (Black Knights Castle) is a bit more sophisticated looking than Kings mtn fortress, and has the black with grey color scheme. It feels like it takes the best of both the previous designs and goes one step further. A ton of figures are also included. 6090 is also similar to 6086 and though I really dislike the figure designs/emblems it is still of very good quality.  If I were to recommend any full castles, based on either play or display, it would be any or all of those. Any older and castles look too simplistic by comparison (but are still cool), and later castles (late 90's to mid 2000) either try too hard to look more grand and special, but end up feeling messy and cluttered and less like a real castle."

Not too bad considering the original Imperial Flagship was $200 (I think) and now fetches somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 NIB. The most expensive part of the build was the black rigging attached to the masts. I needed six of them, and at the time, the cheapest I could find them for was $11 apiece."

By the time I came out of my dark ages, both the Imperial Flagship and the Black Pearl were no longer for sale at retail price. Rather than spend a ton of money trying to acquire both of them on the aftermarket, I decided to combine the two.  Most of the ship parts, like the hull, masts, rigging, and the sails were from the Black Pearl set. I even substituted some design cues, like the stern of the ship, from that set."
