nostalgia,3e1y5j,MyNameIsSeth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:25 2015 UTC,"He lost his ability to turn back into a human in the first book. It was an accident, and at first he was horrified. But eventually he grew to like it more than his pre-hawk life, where he'd been orphaned and was unloved and passed between a drunken uncle and a negligent aunt like an unwanted burden. The fact that eventually that he preferred being a hawk to going back to being a human kid was kinda sad, and a part of Tobias's character development.   In book 13 (through some wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff and an intervention from an alien version of 'god') he was given back his ability to morph. However, the alien 'god' - who was called The Ellimist - was tricky and liked to play games gave Tobias back his morphing ability but left his default body as a hawk. So instead of being a human morpher like the rest of the animorphs, he remained living as a hawk in the forest, but had the ability to change shape. It was kinda fascinating. He remained this way for the rest of the series, fighting the war but never going back to his human life.   He did eventually track down his parents later on in the series..but that's another story."

His father was Elfangor. (for those who forgot, Elfangor was the Andalite who crash landed on earth in the first book and gave them all the morphing power, then was immediately killed by Visser Three.) Elfangor fell in love with a human woman named Loren, who he met while battling the Yeerks. He loved her so much that he returned to Earth, and took on human form and deliberately became stuck in that form so that he could be with her. He called himself Alan Fangor. They gave birth to Tobias, but soon after his birth they were separated, The Ellimist (who is kinda a douche who plays games with people like they're chess pieces) dragged Elfangor off and put him back in his Andalite body and sent him back to war. Something happened to Loren (I can't remember what now) that blinded her and gave her amnesia and she lived the rest of her life disabled, unable to remember that she had a son and unable to remember Elfangor or the adventures that they had together.   About midway through the series Tobias finds out that Elfangor was his father. That that alien life form who he spent mere minutes mere with (Elfangor knew who Tobias was at the time but he was dying and had no time to explain) was his real father. And thus, Ax is technically his uncle. Towards the series, he tracks down his mother. I'm getting goosebumps just recalling it. It was quite emotional."

At SDCC this year, Mondo reveal prototypes for a new line of Madballs for collectors with amazing sculpts but there is no news on when they will come out. But when they do don't expect them to be the soft cheap products from the 80s. Mondo's sculpts are looking to be hard, wonderful plastic that will cost us about $40 a piece I'm betting."

She appeared as a television infomercial psychic in which she claimed she was from Jamaica.  The Psychic Readers Network is said to have coined the title ""Miss Cleo"" and sent unsolicited emails,[3] some of which stated, ""[Miss Cleo has] been authorized to issue you a Special Tarot Reading!... it is vital that you call immediately!"" Charges of deceptive advertising and of fraud on the part of the Psychic Readers Network began to surface around this time.[4][dead link]  In 2001, Access Resource Services doing business as Psychic Readers Network was sued in various lawsuits brought by (among others) Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Florida, and the Federal Communications Commission, although reports later said that ""many customers were satisfied with the service"".[5]  In 2002, the FTC charged the company's owners and Harris' promoters, Steven Feder and Peter Stotz, with deceptive advertising, billing and collection practices; Harris was not indicted.[6] Her promoters agreed to settle for a fraction of the amount they took in.[7][dead link] It emerged that Harris was actually born in Los Angeles, and that her parents were U.S. citizens.[5]"

nostalgia,3dnev0,Dark_anth,9,Sat Jul 18 04:37:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Go see your buddy. The Toasters are constantly touring (And low key shows are basically all they do - don't think I've seen them play to more than 150 or so people), and to be honest, the last gig I saw of their's I wasn't too impressed by. They had a midnight curfew, but went offstage at 11:15 with zero explanation - after only a 40 minute set.   I've seen them a handful of times all over Western NY, but that last one left a bad enough taste in my mouth that I'm not really willing to go anywhere outside my hometown to see them again, unless they've got a great bill.Catch them sometime when you get the chance but be warned - they're definitely one of the ska bands in the ""where are they now?"" file.  EDIT: And for the record, they don't even always do 2 Tone Army at every show. I think I've seen 2, maybe 3 shows where they skipped it. The only ones I've seen at every show I think are Don't Let The Bastards Grind You Down, East Side Beat, Shocker!, and I'm Running Right Through The World."

My thought is that if he was NEVER bullied would he have felt self-conscious enough to lose the weight or if he was never bullied he may have remained comfortable as himself and saw no need for change.

nostalgia,3dikke,The_ChesterCopperpot,0,Thu Jul 16 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"I think you're probably being downvoted because you're over-simplifying things.  Our self-esteem is shaped by nearly everything that happens to us over the course of our entire lives.  Most importantly, it's shaped during early childhood.  To propose that this single event in his life was a complete game changer seems to be an over-simplification.  As I said before, of course the event has an influence on how he feels about himself, but we have no way of knowing how it uniquely interacts with everything else that's ever happened to him."

Just look at how that chocolate rain guy handled it.   If it were me, I would have used the publicity to fund a sequel and maybe kickstart an acting or directing career.

nostalgia,3daup4,lancetay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"I stumbled across this a couple of months ago:   Tufts is the subject of an urban legend. The legend holds that he had been selected to host a well-known radio show as a last-minute replacement for a better known celebrity. The week before Tufts's episode was scheduled, the previous host introduced him with a combination of surprise and outrage, shocked that a relatively unknown actor would succeed him as host. There is no evidence, however, that such an incident occurred. Tufts himself parodied this legend in frequent appearances on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In: seated in a director's chair with his name printed on it, he would turn around to face the camera and utter a word or phrase relevant to the previous bit, in mock contempt. Wikipedia   I think the ""previous host"" was usually said to be Joseph Cotten."

It's funny but a lot of people didn't give half a crap about getting charged for not returning shit, apparently.

I'm sure many of us already felt nostalgia for 90s stuff in high school, even though the year difference was also ""only"" 8 years. I think the issue with feeling nostalgia over modern stuff like CoD4 is that how readily available those popcultural fragments are, not that OP is too young or it isn't far back enough. We still get a new CoD every year so it stays in your consciousness, there are still original trailers from when CoD4 was released on Youtube, you can easily Google images, etc. Heck there are probably still servers up for it. Whereas other nostalgia posted here is something that is really hard to scratch together, and things we mostly forgot till we were reminded of it."

It probably would have been ok - and not scarred - if I hadn't kept filling up my pistol with sea water. Christ, that stung.   That was the same weekend when I learned how to jump from a 10ft wall into sand without overly hurting myself.

nostalgia,3d07xl,WhereIsEmozilla,4,Sun Jul 12 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"Mostly Muppet-related. On ""The Christmas Toy"" DVD, all of the Kermit scenes were cut out. Found the VHS at a thrift shop for $1.99. Was worried it would be busted, but it works. The VCR I picked up at the thrift shop isn't the best shape, but they get donations in regularly where I go.  Just got Muppets Christmas Carol"" on Friday. The DVD cut out the ""When Love is Gone"" scene, but it's on the VHS.   I know that Emmet Otter's Jugband Christmas DVD is not complete (Again, they had to cut out the Kermit scenes due to Disney owning the rights), but the VHS is, so I'm still looking for that.  Oh, and I found an original Little Mermaid with the penis on the cover last week. I have that on DVD and they definitely tweaked the palace to hide the phallus."
nostalgia,3d07xl,Dark_Shroud,3,Sun Jul 12 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"Besides Fantasia I should have guessed it was the Muppet ones.  I have The Muppet Movie on Laserdisc. For the DVD they changed dialogue such as Ms. Piggy ordering a ""grass hopper"" at the restaurant to be more kid friendly. As if kids would know or care about a drink.  I have a rare uncut double feature PAL DVD of Muppet Family Christmas and The Christmas Toy. This took me two years to not only find a copy and find someone willing to ship to the US. The guy was from Denmark.  John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together was never released to home video. You can find old VHS rips online with mono audio. I was tempted to try my hand at editing a copy to see if I could convert it to Stereo and put the songs from the CD in place for the musical numbers but haven't had the time.  John Denver and the Muppets - Rocky Mountain Holiday had a limited DVD release that was also edited. There is a scene where John Denver takes Rolph for a ride in his plane. It was cut from the DVD release for John's family.  The movies I wasn't able to buy unedited, I just downloaded them. There is a massive Muppet .torrent online with everything including VHS rips."

nostalgia,3d07xl,WhereIsEmozilla,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't see this in theaters, only had the VHS. I always thought it was ""Muppets Christmas Carol"" and not ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"".  According to Wikipedia:   ""When Love Is Gone"" was a song performed by the character Belle (Meredith Braun) as she laments that Scrooge's love for money has replaced his love for her. The song was cut from the original 1992 theatrical release by Jeffrey Katzenberg of Walt Disney Studios, who believed that the scene would not appeal to young children. The movie plays with an obvious, jarring edit when the film is played with the song missing. Brian Henson objected to their decision, believing that the song was integral to the plot (the concluding song, ""When Love is Found"", is a direct counterpoint to it), and the song was subsequently restored to the fullscreen VHS and Letterboxed Laserdisc editions. This song was also cut from the 20th Anniversary Edition of the film released on DVD (widescreen only; however, the fullscreen version has the song). The song was also not included on the Blu-ray, or the DVD disc that is packaged with the Blu-ray combo pack released in 2012, and this version of the film on the HD release features new and different music editing to disguise the jarring edit. The song is also absent from the edition of the film featured on Netflix."

Lots of nostalgic references and it's something I've always thought. As an early 80's child, I could never figure out which generation was supposed to apply to me bc my birth year is listed under different labels depending on the source. I feel like I had such a different childhood from my close friends who were born only 3-4 years before or after me.   These are some of my fav parts in the piece...  We’re an enigma, those of us born at the tail end of the 70s and the start of the 80s. Some of the “generational” experts lazily glob us on to Generation X, and others just shove us over to the Millennials they love to hate – no one really gets us or knows where we belong.  We’ve been called Generation Catalano, Xennials, and The Lucky Ones, but no name has really stuck for this strange micro-generation that has both a healthy portion of Gen X grunge cynicism, and a dash of the unbridled optimism of Millennials.  A big part of what makes us the square peg in the round hole of named generations is our strange relationship with technology and the internet.  We came of age just as the very essence of communication was experiencing a seismic shift, and it’s given us a unique perspective that’s half analog old school and half digital new school.   Edit: I guess the whole thing is my favorite part so I stopped myself from copy and pasting the whole thing. Just go read it. These are my fav nostalgic references...   YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY “You’ve Got Mail”  Waiting for the painfully slow dial-up internet to connect   A/S/L (age/sex/location for the uninitiated) Doing research for papers both online and in an old-fashioned card catalogue Writing letters We used pay-phones; we showed up at each other’s houses without warning; we often spoke to our friends’ parents before we got to speak to them; and we had to wait at least an hour to see any photos we’d taken. Napster and spent many a night using the university’s communal Ethernet... downloading the entire OAR album buying cassette singles joining those scam-tastic CD clubs  recording songs onto tapes from the radio   Edit 2: Of the names mentioned in the article, ""Generation Catalano, Xennials, and The Lucky Ones"", Imprefer generation Catalano, but I'd want to change it to Generation Angela or Generation Chase. I used to frequently color my hair with temporary red to look like Angela. She was my idol. (I'm a woman. Bruno is my dog.)"

Apparently incoming freshmen discovered and loved OAR upon arriving at college for at least 5 years.  By the time I went to college, we were using either Limewire or Kazaa. I forget which one came first. But I still distinctly remember some of the first few songs I downloaded on Napster before they got in legal trouble. I taped popular songs off the radio or had the CDs, so the ones I downloaded on Napster were nothing hip... Phil Collins - You'll Be In My Heart and 2 songs from commercials that were played over and over again at the time. Anyone else remember those commercials with Da Da Da and Tainted Love?"

nostalgia,3cxaig,Mega_Manatee,7,Sat Jul 11 17:57:03 2015 UTC,What is this? Does it have a musical alarm?   Edit: nvm. A simple YouTube search showed me. I'd probably throw it out a window if that was my alarm
nostalgia,3cxaig,ImBoverIt,3,Sat Jul 11 20:04:53 2015 UTC,I miss that too. I gave the alarm clock to my 8 yr old niece a few years ago. Funny that she now owns an alarm clock that's significantly older than she is.

nostalgia,3cxaig,mleitch,6,Sat Jul 11 19:47:49 2015 UTC,I've got the alarm clock that you can have if you want. Just PM me your address
nostalgia,3cxaig,gredgex,4,Sat Jul 11 20:07:20 2015 UTC,Why are you giving it away?
nostalgia,3cxaig,mleitch,6,Sat Jul 11 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"It's been sitting in my closet for years and it isn't worth the hassle trying to sell it. It works fine and everything, I just have no need for it"
nostalgia,3cxaig,Buddyboy451,2,Sat Jul 11 21:14:53 2015 UTC,If he doesn't  want it I'll take it. Mine got lost in various moves as a kid. Loved that thing.
