Now that you can see just about anything on TV, less people are going to the theatre and are staying at home. Granted, I'm a film major with a minor in screenwriting and a lot of this is coming from what I've seen through the years, so it may not be accurate. I'm also smashed so there's a chance I'm just spouting nonsense. Just a drunk girl's thoughts on the matter.  Fuck, I wrote a lot. Didn't mean to, sorry. Guess that's the writing minor in me."
ComedyCemetery,3aew72,dachungdynasty,2,Sat Jun 20 08:46:15 2015 UTC,That's pretty much exactly why I said what I said. Right now is what a lot of ppl are saying is the golden age of television :)
ComedyCemetery,3aew72,IdiotaRandoma,-5,Sat Jun 20 15:46:04 2015 UTC,"Last I saw, TV was rife with lazy writing, dumb plots, stereotypical characters, and a general failure to deliver anything worth watching. Then again, I took the TV out of my room in 2013 and hadn't watched much at all since 2010 or so, so maybe something changed since then. All I know currently is that The Big Bang Theory is still on the air, so I'm left to assume that the cancer has yet to be cut out of TV."
ComedyCemetery,3aew72,dachungdynasty,3,Sat Jun 20 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"To be fair, big bang theory jokes are the lowest hanging fruits so close to the ground they pick them up off the grass and yes it is a cancer but so is anything that caters to the lowest common denominator. But you can't say the same about Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. And if drama isn't your thing you could always opt for anything by Dan Harmon like Rick and Morty, or Louis Ck"
ComedyCemetery,3aew72,IdiotaRandoma,-2,Sat Jun 20 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"But you can't say the same about Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.   Never seen either, personally, but they are at least well-received.   Rick and Morty, or Louis Ck   I think I'd rather hit myself with a hammer than subject myself to either."
ComedyCemetery,3aew72,dachungdynasty,6,Sat Jun 20 22:06:26 2015 UTC,Damn at what age did your sense of humor die?
ComedyCemetery,3aew72,Gemuese11,-2,Sat Jun 20 22:14:10 2015 UTC,"It's still alive and well, actually. I know enough of Louis C.K. that I don't find him funny and, while I haven't actually watched Rick and Morty, just a few glances at commercials for it tells me everything I need to know about it, which is to avoid it."
ComedyCemetery,3aew72,IdiotaRandoma,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:16:51 2015 UTC,So u dont like vulgar + intelligent comedy? In any case there are so many different content creators with varied styles and backgrounds there must be something that would cater to you. It would be a shame if you never gave any of them a chance. But then again there's more to life than Tv. But it's so damn good nowadays
ComedyCemetery,3aew72,NinetoFiveHero,2,Sat Jun 20 22:21:06 2015 UTC,"well, no wonder you hate tv. you dont see the things that are brilliant"
ComedyCemetery,3akrla,kaltivel,5,Sun Jun 21 04:08:06 2015 UTC,That was great
ComedyCemetery,3akrla,HSV1887,4,Sun Jun 21 17:42:41 2015 UTC,No no no. This is hilarious.
ComedyCemetery,3akrla,nerotheus,5,Mon Jun 22 19:46:50 2015 UTC,It's definitely going for heavy irony.

ComedyCemetery,39yf2l,GrungeLord,13,Mon Jun 15 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"Good times, good times..."
ComedyCemetery,39yf2l,johnald42,8,Mon Jun 15 20:43:35 2015 UTC,With most of these things I can at least see the linear thought process of how someone might think the terrible joke is in fact a joke. The last frame here seems completely apropos of nothing.
ComedyCemetery,39yf2l,Shane_the_P,23,Tue Jun 16 00:31:12 2015 UTC,"I think the joke's pretty clear. It's an attempt at bathos using the rule of three.   First guy has an army - a display of his own power and significance.   Second guy has a hulk - a one-up from the first guy with an arguably better display of power and significance.   Third guy has a jar of dirt - a ludicrous attempt to display the power and significance that the first two have already shown, but exclaimed (at least in the film) with such confidence that it questions the guidelines for power and significance that the first two have already set out and are playing to.   I don't think it's a bad joke overall. I didn't laugh, but it makes sense at least."
ComedyCemetery,39yf2l,LIFE_DONT_ANIMATE,7,Tue Jun 16 10:03:36 2015 UTC,"Dude, that was a perfect logical dissection of the joke. Props"
ComedyCemetery,39yf2l,DrunkLobotomist,-1,Sat Jun 20 10:26:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly if I have to think about it THAT hard, it's a shot joke. This joke is no exception and even after your explanation I'm not sure that's it."
ComedyCemetery,39yf2l,Shane_the_P,14,Tue Jun 16 15:12:02 2015 UTC,You don't have to think very hard at all though. Bathos and the rule of three are very common techniques in creating humour. The joke is obvious.
ComedyCemetery,39yf2l,LIFE_DONT_ANIMATE,-1,Tue Jun 16 16:56:38 2015 UTC,I guess we just have a completely different view of the whole thing.
ComedyCemetery,39yf2l,Shane_the_P,9,Tue Jun 16 19:26:51 2015 UTC,"It's just the ""teh penguin of d00m"" concept of mistaking ""randomness"" with humor"
