WonderTrade,3e4gsq,Eevee123456789,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"I have one of those too, and I know mine is hacked."
WonderTrade,3e4gsq,gdogg24,3,Tue Jul 21 22:06:00 2015 UTC,It's a pokemon from an event in Japan that occurred a couple weeks ago I believe  http://serebii.net/events/dex/129.shtml
WonderTrade,3e4gsq,gdogg24,3,Tue Jul 21 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"And BTW, the ball is a cherish ball which is only available for event pokemon without hacking."
WonderTrade,3e4gsq,Emarelda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:19:15 2015 UTC,You CAN put them on pokemon with the powersaves action replay. But usually the pokebank servers will catch them.
WonderTrade,3e4gsq,gdogg24,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:29:54 2015 UTC,Oh right! Any idea what the point of the event was? Seems a bit odd to just give out some magikarp haha
WonderTrade,3e4gsq,CharmiePK,3,Tue Jul 21 22:50:15 2015 UTC,I think it was just the opening of a Pokemon Center store in Hiroshima. Like a Pokemon specialty store. I think it was just something fun and different to hand out.
WonderTrade,3e4gsq,robin670,2,Tue Jul 21 22:56:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, fair enough! Thanks for the info :D"
WonderTrade,3e5jsi,jen_pai,5,Wed Jul 22 03:05:16 2015 UTC,Whimsicott! Let blue balls of cotton float around the pss before settling down to make someone's day!!
WonderTrade,3e5jsi,bitterbunny5,4,Wed Jul 22 03:33:56 2015 UTC,"Perhaps some shiny little Litwick with egg moves? You can hold a ""candle light summer festival"" in which all the ""guests"" receive a candle to hold onto. As the night goes on, they evolve, the candle glows brighter and becomes more luminescent until they are able to form a chandelier at the end of the night :)"
WonderTrade,3e5jsi,itachinamikaze,3,Wed Jul 22 03:30:43 2015 UTC,"You could do mothim, since even burmy seems to be elusive to OR/AS players (even the GTS is usually desolate of burmy and its evolutions, maybe I'm wrong and haven't been searching hard enough)  ...of course, exclusive legendaries are always welcome cough shaymin celebi cough"
WonderTrade,3e5jsi,masima4567,2,Wed Jul 22 03:33:00 2015 UTC,"If you have I think shiny Weaville would be amazing. Aside from having an amazing shiny form (imo), I think it's also one of the harder Pokemon to obtain due to its tedious method of evolution (trade holding razor claw at night, what?).  Egg moves (icicle crash, low kick, fake out) need to chain bred and Knock Off is a tutor only move. So a competitively viable Weaville is pretty hard to come by without the help of powersaves I think.   Anyways, you are amazing for doing this on Wondertrade Wednesday. Whatever you decide to trade I really hope I somehow run into you haha. I'll be trading off 5-6IV moonball Growlithes with egg moves."

WonderTrade,3dugw2,Namorkeil,5,Sun Jul 19 16:22:56 2015 UTC,Thanks again for everyone making this an awesome weekly event :) absolutely love it. I don't know if you guys would be okay with this but I'm planning on getting an action replay just so that I can try and create a whole bunch of the event Vivillions for anyone who participates in this event. I know that they are pretty near impossible to get your hands on and I know I'd love to have one for my collection of beautiful bugs.  I will post when I get it and if people have issues with me using it then I may or may not send them out. Hope you all had a great scatterbug Sunday and can't wait for next week.

Bonsly are actually incredibly rare at least in Generation VI, so I tend to hope I can help at least a few trainers at a time obtain one. :)  The ones I breed currently have two Egg Moves; Stealth Rock and Rollout. I might eventually work on this though. Just thought I'd share!  As for suggestions to yourself, you could consider breeding Bonsly too! Otherwise maybe another kind of Pokemon which is otherwise tricky to obtain?"
WonderTrade,3dgd3z,JoeJacob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:32:36 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing, I haven't had much of a hard time obtaining anything, so I was just trying to get a feel for what everyone likes getting that I could realistically breed :)"
WonderTrade,3dgd3z,JoeJacob,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"Ah I see! Yeah, I realise that a lot of people who use this subreddit and who breed for WTW probably have completed the national dex, and don't need Bonsly, or any Pokemon for that reason, but given that (in Generation VI) Bonsly and Sudowoodo can only be found with a 5% chance in a horde encounter (being mixed encounters alongside four Phantumps or Trevenants respectively), which seems stupidly rare, it might be worth handing them out as in my mind it might be hard work for other people to obtain them :)"

I can understand being disappointed with your gift, but it does nobody any good to be rude! Or greedy!  The WTs have been so bad today I didn't want to encourage it even more by sending out my three boxes of Keldeo along with the other shinies. Y'can't clean up WonderTrade if people's response to that is to pour more junk in. Next week will hopefully be better. Until then, I'll just send out shinies most people probably don't automatically go for. :) Somebody will appreciate them."
WonderTrade,3dcirp,-spaceoddity,2,Wed Jul 15 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"I bet the dude whose shoutout was ""WantBetterShiny"" sent over a Zigzagoon/trash too."
WonderTrade,3dcirp,Mokibutt,3,Thu Jul 16 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, Zigzagoon. I don't get too mad these days when I get a Zig or some other unwanted Poke, but the cheek of this guy was just . . . wow. That got me a little hot under the collar."
WonderTrade,3dcirp,heatherlorali,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:16:41 2015 UTC,I would love a shiny Beautifly! It's so cute! Guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
WonderTrade,3dcirp,hachibukai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:20:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine to trade and giveaway hacked Pokemon if you disclose it, but I think it's rude to put up hacked shinys on WT. A lot of people (myself included) value shinys for their rarity, and they should be able to use WT without having hacked 'mons forced on them that are impossible to check. Just do a giveaway on Reddit. People shouldn't have to deal with hackers without consenting first."
WonderTrade,3dcirp,Mokibutt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree. WT is such a hack fest now that anything coming from it should be viewed as a novelty, not something for more serious collectors. If you want non hacked for sure, obtain everything on your own because that's the only way to be sure.  If you get a hack and you don't like hacks throw it back in. Somebody wants it.  I would argue that it's much more rude to trade trash Pokemon."

This morning definitely put the ""wonder"" in it though. My daughter faceplanted while going downhill on her scooter and had to get stitches. According to her, it was totally worth it. So while I'm home with my son waiting for news, I'm trading trading hoping maybe random shiny to brighten her day... Zapdos, level 100. It went a LONG way towards cheering her up when she got home. If the person that traded it is on here, thank you!  In the end, between us, we also got 2 shiny Furfrou's named Sirius, shiny Cresselia, lvl 100 shiny Politoed, shiny Gastly, shiny Mudkip, and shiny Ambipom. She's been dying for a Yveltal, and I managed to snag one for her off the GTS. Never seen so many shinies on the WT - feel better karma? Either way, it helped get her mind off of all of her scrapes and bruises while we celebrated and bragged and tormented the husband with Pokemon talk.

WonderTrade,3d5g47,MilHaus2000,3,Mon Jul 13 17:52:11 2015 UTC,Regular is fine! Even better really..do you want some help understanding IVs and EV's It also went way over my head till someone much younger then me explained it in children's words and now I get it lol people online try to explain in great detail something that really isn't that hard
WonderTrade,3d5g47,robin670,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"Sure, that'd be awesome!"
WonderTrade,3d5g47,robin670,2,Mon Jul 13 19:03:11 2015 UTC,This was a simple explanation ...if you understand this breeding is not so hard....to breed a perfect pokemon is skill and luck..having a perfect breeding ditto really helps...but if you get this then you can Google how to breed a perfect pokemon and you will understand what they are saying now
WonderTrade,3d5g47,robin670,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"Ok...IVs are your pokemons stats HP, attack, defence, sp attack, sp defence, and speed....each one is determined by a number between 0 and 31...0 being the worst you can get and 31 the best...you cannot see these numbers....to know if your pokemon has a perfect 31 in any of its stats you need to go to the iv checker in the game....if your pokemon has a perfect 31 in any of its stats the iv checker will name that stat....example iv checker says HP and speed when he talks but mentions  no other stats ...that means HP and speed are 31 the rest are random but not 31....if he names all 6 stats it is a perfect iv pokemon....if he says something is dismal then it is 0 in that stat...example iv checker says its HP is pretty dismal you know then HP is 0... I am not going to mention breeding cuz like I said that's how it gets confusing"
WonderTrade,3d5g47,Shiny_Sylveon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"That's a good explanation :) just curious though, is this a simple explanation of IVs and how to breed for them? I like feedback so I can continue to improve it for others so they can learn as well :)"
WonderTrade,3d5g47,robin670,2,Mon Jul 13 19:29:58 2015 UTC,That link is helpful for sure... It covers most of it
WonderTrade,3d5g47,Shiny_Sylveon,3,Mon Jul 13 19:36:42 2015 UTC,I tried to keep it as simple as possible for beginners. I was a complete newbie at Pokemon a couple years ago and it was hard for me to find anything that wasn't over complicated so I tried to fix that for others
WonderTrade,3d5g47,robin670,2,Mon Jul 13 19:42:03 2015 UTC,Yes I had the same problem everything just seemed so complicated ...your guide is very good I think I would have understood it as a newbie
WonderTrade,3d5g47,Shiny_Sylveon,2,Mon Jul 13 19:43:41 2015 UTC,Yay that's good to know :) most guides throw in unnecessary stuff or leave out stuff that confuses even me lol
WonderTrade,3d5g47,robin670,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:30 2015 UTC,"Ok EV's...effort values...every pokemon you battle gives you a set number of EV's....the evs are added to your total stats...example your defence is 100, you go battle a pokemon that gives evs for defence your defence goes up to 101 ...the EV's are worth 1 stat increase per 4 EV's...so if you go against a pokemon that only gave you 2 EV's in defence then you would need to fight another to make your stat go up one....you can have a total of 510 EV's added to through out your 6 stats...but no higher the 252 per stat....so EV's are a bit more confusing...you can check how these stats have been improved in the pokemon super training...you can also increase EV's there ...it is very helpful to EV train pokemon ...if your pokemon has really bad defence or speed ect...you can make it better....you can also use berryjuices, HP ups ect...."
WonderTrade,3d5g47,robin670,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:29:00 2015 UTC,And you can Google how many EV's a pokemon will give you in battle ...everyone is different but they are set numbers

Do NOT deposit starters, Zigzagoons, Wurmples, Poochyenas, or Ralts as I will not be able to find those because the GTS glitches for them.   I'll be WTing for awhile today and I'll be editing this comment or making a new one saying when I am not sending out anymore"

I was just more looking to see what the cost/benefit ratio tends to be when you send out/deposit if you're looking for an HA. Based on the response, it doesn't look too good :/ just wish people would be more honest in the trade system...things would flow better."
WonderTrade,3c98vj,megasnoge,2,Mon Jul 6 03:27:05 2015 UTC,it is luck really! some people do abuse the GTS system to make unfair trades but just as many will read it and trade what you ask for! Froakie is pretty commonly sent out on wonder trade so you might just be better to use that and keep checking them to see if one with HA is sent out!
WonderTrade,3c98vj,vesfynn,2,Mon Jul 6 05:39:33 2015 UTC,Essentially just whether or not someone is willing to manipulate the GTS to make unfair trades. Same goes for if you ask for a shiny Pokemon. There's always a fairly high chance of getting a normal Pokemon.

WonderTrade,3b9z0j,heatherlorali,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"So as someone who doesn't battle competitively, I never got into the whole IV/HA/egg-move breeding scene, but I do love shinies and will often breed loads of mons through the Masuda method to try and get some. I usually try to do ones that I feel like would be somewhat desirable, like starters or rarer mons instead of early-game commons, but I worry that people will be disappointed by them anyway just because of their bad stats/natures/moves/abilities.  Am I just being paranoid, and this isn't a big deal? Or are my boxes full of Lvl 1 Snivys and Chikoritas just as bad as Zigzagoons if they aren't bred appropriately? If so, what's an easy way I can improve them without having to go through the headache of figuring out competitive movesets and getting perfect IVs?"

WonderTrade,3b3him,lmoralesq,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:07:46 2015 UTC,I was made up an didn't know you could get legendary Pokemon in a wonder trade. I think once my pokedex is complete I shall share the love with any I have. I do indeed. Is there anything I can help with?

WonderTrade,3b3him,Shadowclaimer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"Relative beginner here. Just started up after a long hiatus...haven't played since red.  Needless to say, when people say they're trying to complete their dex, are they literally keeping every pokemon? Or does it ""count"" to own one and trade/release it to have it's info?  And if yes, I'm assuming this is accomplished using the bank/transporter program (which I am still unfamiliar with). Not intending to rob the post here.  On topic: I totally know that feel. I WTd a Wurmple (with Pokerus, in my defense) for a shiny Groudon. Heh"
WonderTrade,3b3him,mrsmith099,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"A ""living dex"" is one of everything kept in your box.  Completing your pokedex is just having everything for a moment."
WonderTrade,3b3him,Grantman20,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"Yes the ""living dex"" would be ideal but also greedy. I now have a Pokemon that people will want in exchange, so hopefully swap them about. Once it's complete I will send them out to the wonderful world trade. I stopped after Ruby but came back after a friend shown me Pokemon X at work. I only discovered o power an trade at my 7th gym badge which was guttering."

Well, someone will be happy to get a Feraligatr. :)  EDIT: [in] Illumise, Zigzagoon x2, Cottonee, Dunsparce, Magikarp, Mawile, Whismur, Voltorb, Snivy, Zubat, Carvanha, Pelipper, Poochyena x2, Slowpoke, Machop, Pikachu, Charmander, Taillow, Growlithe, Gastly, Totodile, Tentacool, Pansear, Durant  Ugh, there's usually something I can throw back into WT. Got a bunch of bleh this time. Maybe my evening Greninjas will have better luck. :)  Later I might send [out] a box of [hacked] shiny Protean Greninja.  EDIT: [in] Wurmple x3, Scatterbug (common pattern, I discovered), Aerodactyl (threw this back in b/c it was HA and had a very nice moveset), Zigzagoon x4, Roselia, Murkrow, Eevee HA (I always keep these for various Eeveelution builds), Ralts, Shinx, Kricketune, Dwebble, Omanyte, Froakie, Flabebe, Gloom, Absol, Tangela, Barboach, Purugly, Luvdisc, Gulpin, Taillow, Charmander (thrown back in for HA and great moveset), Combee (male, of course), Dugtrio (sent back to WT--was BR), Whismur, Swirlix (slapped a Whipped Dream on it and sent it off)  It's been oodles of fun building less common Pokes for WT. I think I'll be doing a little WT every evening from now on. :D Maybe tomorrow I'll do some shiny Vespiquens. They're so irritating to get ahold of."

WonderTrade,39ldzz,CommanderSideswipe,2,Fri Jun 26 18:29:18 2015 UTC,Low-level trash like Poochyena and Taillow get evolved and sent back out as Mightyena and Swellow.  Stuff like Zigzagoon gets saved for lottery.  Breedjects either get lottery treatment (Charmander and Froakie) or evolved to second stage and sent back out.  Especially if it's Fennekin because I like to flood the world with Braixen.
WonderTrade,39ldzz,Justmicheal,2,Fri Jun 12 18:30:19 2015 UTC,Currently I'm keeping all of mine just for the daily lottery so I have better chances to stock up on free pp items. If I get something with the same trainer id I just send it back out. Getting really tired of seeing zigzagoons though.

WonderTrade,38l1rj,HeartsOnAFuneralPyre,2,Thu Jun 4 22:17:53 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! Last week I put in a newly bred level one skitty and thought I'd ask for a Ho-Oh on the GTS because why not. If people will ask for a manaphy or a meloetta, then a Ho-Oh seemed more reasonable I guess. It was really more of a joke than anything else since I have AS and didn't have the chance to get one. A day later, I find my skitty had been traded for a level 51 Japanese Ho-Oh lol. There truly are some generous and funny people out there. Just goes to show that if there's a 'mon you want, there's really nothing to lose by asking for it. Again, congratulations."

WonderTrade,3767in,OriDoodle,4,Mon May 25 05:31:42 2015 UTC,"They get the Pokedex credit for both if it evolves when they get it.   I do most of my wonder-trading with streams nowadays though, and in that case I don't want a Pokemon that evolves. [And I don't send them out in that context either, because my fellow viewers don't like receiving them.] Because of that, I usually put my trade-evo Pokemon up on GTS for the same Pokemon (no gender or level restriction) with the message ""evolve"" then I'll pick up the evo and trade it out evolved."
WonderTrade,3767in,Fyora,2,Mon May 25 05:43:18 2015 UTC,"What are streams? I understood about 75% of that. I'm just relearning all of this stuff, haven't played pokemon seriously since red on my GB color.  (i know about twitch streams, is that what you mean? how do you trade over those?)"
WonderTrade,3767in,Fyora,3,Mon May 25 06:08:12 2015 UTC,"I mean twitch streams, but there are also youtube streams. Basically, it goes like this:   Get your WT ready (to the final ""Yes"" selection, but don't hit it yet.) Watch the chat of a stream, they'll usually have a bot come up with a counter that counts down (1 message per #) from either 3 or 5, going to either 0 or GO. When the bot sends ""0"" or ""GO"" (depends on the streamer) in the chat you hit yes, and all of the other viewers & the host are doing the same thing. This should increase your chances of potentially connecting with the host (who is usually sending out good stuff) or at least other viewers (depending on the community, they might be sending out awesome stuff or crap).   I always get better stuff when I WT along with a stream than when I don't, even the ones whose viewers send out crap. Most of the WT streamers do a stream at least on Wednesday, some of them do Wednesday and Saturday. And there's one guy who has it automated to go 24/7. lol"
WonderTrade,3767in,Fyora,2,Mon May 25 06:16:57 2015 UTC,ooooh gotcha! that makes a lot of sense. I'm still quite enjoying getting really random stuff since i have so few pokemon currently.

Out: Graveler > In: Surskit holding a Honey  Out: Machoke > In: Seedot   Out: Lanturn > In: Pansage nicknamed Leaf Matter  Out: Chinchou > In: French Zigzagoon. Apparently Zigzagoon is ""Zigzaton"" in French.  Out: Darmanitan > In: Spanish Archen. Cute bird! :O  Out: Swalot > In: Squirtle!!! I got a starter!  Out: Chimecho > In: Shellos (I have no idea if that's good or not, it just looks odd. It's a slug or something.)  Out: Ninjask > In: Pelipper  Out: Shedinja > In: Fletchling. That's good, I need a pokemon to hatch eggs faster.  Overall, kinda disappointing, but the Squirtle and Fletchling are good. Did I do this WTW thing correctly?"
WonderTrade,36l6o3,evaplayspokemon,2,Wed May 20 15:39:21 2015 UTC,Pretty much!   If you'd like you can contribute your incoming Pokemon to the database too. I tend to breed a few boxes of the higher demand Pokemon and send them out all at once. It's so much fun to see what you get in return! My Livingdex (in progress) is coming along almost entirely from Wonder Trade. :D
WonderTrade,36l6o3,xNexx_,1 point,Wed May 20 18:43:24 2015 UTC,I'll be trading Sandshrew and Koffing.   Sandshrew:  M: Nevada  F: Arizona  Koffing  M: James  F: Janette
WonderTrade,36l6o3,Avonna-wx,1 point,Wed May 20 16:39:17 2015 UTC,I'm sending out level 1 5 IV Drowzees in a few minutes.
WonderTrade,36l6o3,Baltony,1 point,Wed May 20 20:12:31 2015 UTC,Sending out a box of Hacked/Cloned shiny Haunters with 6 IVs
WonderTrade,36l6o3,jancmen,1 point,Thu May 21 02:03:47 2015 UTC,So I just dropped a bunch of Charmanders and Munchlaxes when I suddenly got a Regigigas.... Do I assume it's hacked/cloned or do I start celebrating?
WonderTrade,36l6o3,xNexx_,1 point,Wed May 20 21:18:23 2015 UTC,"Should I breed Koffing, Sandshrew, or Sneasel?"
WonderTrade,36l6o3,Mollyneonfox,2,Wed May 20 23:46:07 2015 UTC,Koffing is always cool to get!
WonderTrade,36l6o3,TheEpicBurrito,1 point,Thu May 21 03:17:52 2015 UTC,Koffing.
WonderTrade,36l6o3,Lunatic768,1 point,Thu May 21 06:13:54 2015 UTC,"I have impish gibles I'm sending out, a box in the next hour, and probably a box late tonight PST (vacation won't stop me from WTW)"
WonderTrade,36l6o3,Jacekeara,-1,Wed May 20 09:45:56 2015 UTC,Going to be starting a living dex tonight. Going to try and get all female (as much as possible) and have every single one with their HA. Should be fun and hoping wondertrades will help out with it. Gonna be a pain to get manaphy. Thank god I got most of the other legendaries already. Good luck to everyone tonight. Also I will most likely be sending out combees. Mostly male and the odd female. If you get one from an OT jacekeara it should be named princess if it is a female
WonderTrade,36l6o3,Zigzagoonies,-11,Wed May 20 15:39:45 2015 UTC,Wondertrading 2 boxes of wurmples and wingulls

WonderTrade,36ljyw,MidnightCritic,1 point,Wed May 20 07:34:43 2015 UTC,I got a female one! Thanks a ton!
WonderTrade,36ljyw,pajamawolfie,1 point,Thu May 21 15:50:28 2015 UTC,Oh sweet! Do you recall which one you sent me? Or was it randomly sent from someone else?
WonderTrade,36jgyo,robin670,3,Tue May 19 20:59:25 2015 UTC,"You can look up any Pokemon on Wonder Trade Analytics and get a decent idea of how desirable or not it is.  Munchlax, for example, only has 23 trades (fairly low), but a 93.33% approval rating, so it will probably be enjoyed by the vast majority of people who receive one."
WonderTrade,36jgyo,Fyora,2,Tue May 19 21:56:24 2015 UTC,just send out zigzagoons and wurmples  like everyone else lol jk (i hate people that do this)
WonderTrade,36jgyo,justinhatguy,1 point,Wed May 20 05:30:50 2015 UTC,"Every one I get I release, I hate them, no point in sending them back out there."

WonderTrade,36jgyo,StatikDynamik,1 point,Wed May 20 05:41:11 2015 UTC,"Well,  if any of you are on Wondertrade, keep an eye out for me.  OT: Alan from Texas,  United States. See you all on Wondertrade tomorrow."
WonderTrade,36jgyo,BadWolfTexan,2,Wed May 20 05:56:50 2015 UTC,"Munchlax is a great idea! Even though it's not the most useful thing, it will complete a dex entry for a lot of people out there."
WonderTrade,36jgyo,BadWolfTexan,1 point,Wed May 20 20:10:29 2015 UTC,"I just spent a few hours breeding Rotom and Porygon,  both of which have a high approval ratings.  I even got a few Shinies as I hatched them.  I might include those tomorrow during my Wondertrade Wednesday tomorrow around 9pm to 12am."
