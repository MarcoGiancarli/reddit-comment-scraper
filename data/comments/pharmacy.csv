That poster is only marketing from the manufacturer of brand Suboxone, who want to make more money. The patent in Canada was over a few months back, and we switched everyone to generic as mandated by law (the pharmacy must, by law, give you the lowest cost medically equivalent product, unless you specifically request the brand).   We only serve about 20 or so Suboxone patients, but there have been no complaints about the effectiveness of the generic. Only one person requested the brand, and that was because he really didn't like the taste/texture of the generic.   Can you take a picture of the poster? If they specifically claim that the brand is ""better,"" that's completely false. If they're displaying it in a public area (waiting room) as opposed to a private area (examination room), they may even be breaking the law against direct to consumer advertising (depending on the wording of the poster)."
pharmacy,3e3ice,overrule,5,Tue Jul 21 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think that I would be able to get away with taking a picture of it. I am not specifically aware of any policy regarding taking pictures in the clinic that don't show people (privacy) or the clinic layout (casing for a robbery or something like that), but I assume that they would say no.  As for the location of the poster: when you walk into the clinic, there is a waiting room. MMT/Suboxone clients are required to leave urine samples 1 or 2 times per week. To get to the washroom, the staff need to open a locked door that separates the waiting room from the rest of the clinic. In the hallway that you enter after passing through the door (which has several rooms branching off of it, including the washroom), they have a couple posters. The (new) Suboxone poster is one of them.  It's not readily visible from the waiting room or outside the clinic, but it's not in an exam room or anywhere private."

pharmacy,3e3ice,trimmins,4,Wed Jul 22 01:50:47 2015 UTC,"Lower cost interchangeable. I'm a pharmacist in Australia and although there is no specific law pertaining to generics, it would be very helpful for the expectation to be for every patient to receive the generic unless they specify otherwise.  So many patients (in my experience generally middle-aged patients) don't even give you the opportunity to attempt to explain how it will benefit not only themselves but also the government (and therefore their tax dollars), as well as the pharmacy they are shopping at.  In Australia you generally ask the patient if they have a brand preference. You don't have to, but then you risk the blacklash of a patient coming back a week later with an open box of the generic and shouting down the pharmacy for 10 minutes because ""no one asked them if they wanted the brand name"" and ""this one doesn't work for them"".  The problem with asking the patient is that the onus is on someone that has little to no knowledge of how medication substitution works, and many times the answer is ""give me what the doctor has written"" (in which case it is usually whichever brand's rep takes them out to the most lavish lunches) or ""I don't want the 'no name' one"". It seems they draw comparisons between home brand items that don't have legislation regulating their quality and therefore are of lesser quality than branded products.  While I'm pretty good at converting people through explanation, some just won't listen.  Essentially the TLDR of my rambling rant is that if I didn't have to ask and could just supply the generic (and had to by law) many headaches would be avoided."
pharmacy,3e3ice,N_Seven,11,Wed Jul 22 02:04:22 2015 UTC,"The only time EVER that the brand MIGHT be better than generic for a patient is with medications that have narrow therapeutic ranges. That is to say, a patient who needs a very specific level of a drug in their blood to control a disease might be put at risk if they're switched from one brand or another. The new drug might provide less drug at the same dose and cause problems.  Suboxone is NOT one of these drugs. This is marketing bullshit."

I have no idea what laws are like around pharmaceuticals in Canada. Could the office be getting kickbacks for the brand? I can't imagine any other reason a Dr. Would want to advertise for brand name name Suboxone.   TL;DR: it's total marketing BS, and that office should be ashamed for putting the posters up.  Also, my suboxone and my methadone patients are my favorites. Every single one at my pharmacy is more on top of their meds and due dates than any other group of patients and know all of the policies.

I think it would be fair to say that that describes me. I have Aspergers and one of my interests is reading about different medications. I'm one of the (probably rare) patients that will actually read the entire monograph whenever I get a prescription for a medication I haven't taken before.  Questions like, ""Why do some medications have HCl and some use HBr? Why does Viagra use 'citrate' instead of 'fumarate'? [as examples]"" keep me up at night :p LOL.  I think that I'd probably be very technically proficient as a pharmacist (less so with customer service skills)... unfortunately, I don't think that pharmacy would be a good fit for me if I could even get licensed (due to my history of addiction).  Anyways, what I'm trying to say in a roundabout way is that while I'm certainly not as knowledgeable as a doctor or pharmacist, I think it might cause problems for me if I make it seem like I know ""too much"" about medications (narcotics in particular).

I don't know much else about it, but is that something that could fit into my treatment plan?""   My mention about people being involved in their own care was more from a pharmacy perspective. They automatically furnish ID for controls. They don't ask for refills more than a day or 2 early. They know how many pills they have, when their appointments are, and what their copays should be.

They then ""patent hopped"" everyone to the film for ""safety"" reasons (your children won't be able to overdose on individual films compared to a bottle of tablets). It's an extremely common tactic drug manufacturers use to keep people on their brand name medication when a generic becomes available.    Just look up ""patent hopping"" or ""evergreening"". Patents are based on the form of the drug ""extended release, sub-lingual, oral, etc)"" almost as much as the drug itself.  The sublingual tablet is different in that it comes in a bottle instead of individual films.

pharmacy,3e0hm5,ekeg15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not adding anything worthwhile to this, except for the fact that I am confused. Does your pharmacy manager want scripts checked in a certain amount of time? Why would you be penalized? This is foreign to me."
pharmacy,3e0hm5,specialk08,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:12:38 2015 UTC,It's the pharmacy system. CVS's system does this too. Used to drive me crazy especially during peak times when the entire queue was red.
pharmacy,3e0hm5,RidaB91,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, too add it is a ""metric"" that is tracked to show how well the pharmacy is adhering to workflow. If the metrics for a store don't meet a certain level, the pharmacy gets in trouble with upper management (district managers and so forth)."
pharmacy,3e0hm5,aelephant,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:40:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a corporate penalty for it, but watch out if the customer has prescription alerts, because it will result in an Rx message for every script you defer. So you may or may not wanna temporarily disable those."

I'm guessing enough rednecks finally complained about the shit load of foreigners who can barely speak the damn language, let alone give an intelligible consultation."
pharmacy,3dwy84,pharmawhore,11,Mon Jul 20 10:24:30 2015 UTC,Is it politically incorrect to say that I hate doing transfers with pharmacists who have thick accents? It's a pain in the ass to have them repeat everything they say.
pharmacy,3dwy84,azwethinkweizm,5,Mon Jul 20 13:20:18 2015 UTC,No it's not incorrect. Being a pharmacist is a whole package and it's dangerous they're not communicating effectively
pharmacy,3dwy84,yayblah,13,Mon Jul 20 18:55:56 2015 UTC,"Finally means the kiddies with good grades and the communication skills of a 16 year old shut in will have to learn to properly counsel before they graduate, regardless of what color they are. I've met some last year students on rotations who struggled counseling amlodipine, and English wasn't his problem. He sure loved to brag about his 4.0 tho!"
pharmacy,3dwy84,HankiePankie315,9,Mon Jul 20 11:52:20 2015 UTC,"Yikes. It blows my mind how you could know the material well enough to have a 4.0 GPA but be unable to apply that in the real world. Is this guy aware of how lacking they are in terms of counseling?  It's always nice to see when someone can admit their weaknesses. I had a nursing professor whose sister was also a nurse. The professor is very book-smart while her sister is more clinically-smart (she struggled a lot in school, GPA was 3.0 at her best). My professor said that if she were in the hospital and she could choose between herself or her sister to be her nurse, she'd pick her sister, since she's so much better with clinical situations.  I wish more people were aware of or admitted their weaknesses, especially in health care, it's a great way to learn to improve via yourself (denial is a powerful thing!) or the help of others. Easier said than done for most though, eh?"

My pharmacy manager was tasked with training a new grad pharmacist.  She(new pharmacist) had grown up in the middle east, was older (50 or 60 I think?), and seemed like she was fairly intelligent.  However, she had a serious problem with communicating with patients.  My favorite story about her: My pharmacy manager was quizzing us both and asking us to counsel her(manager) as if she was a patient.  The drug was metronidazole.  Simple, right? Well, the new grad said in this counsel that cancer would be a side-effect.  My manager and I just give each other a blank stare and try to register what we just heard.  Who knows where this lady ended up, but I wouldn't let her near patients."

pharmacy,3dwy84,YourMotherLovedMe,8,Tue Jul 21 01:27:48 2015 UTC,So basically kind of what Canadian pharmacists have to go through before getting their license (well the assessment of communication skills)
pharmacy,3dwy84,cookiesfly,3,Mon Jul 20 13:00:52 2015 UTC,"Wait.. you guys didn't need to be assessed on your counseling prior to being licensed?? It's a whole new ball game to prepare for that part of our exam: Twenty consecutive 7-minute stations, each with an evaluator and an actor with a standardized script for some kind of drug-related problem that you must solve within the time-frame. Anything is fair game whether it be community, hospital, ambulatory .. There are critical points you need to make to pass the station and points that can make you auto-fail a station. It's really not a fun day."
pharmacy,3dwy84,justdawdling,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:30 2015 UTC,"Nope. We go through counseling during our schooling as part of ""Lab"" but we are not tested on it at all. Some states require additional testing, like NYS, where you have to compound but that's about it."

There are a ton of errors and many of them seem to be lacking management skills (vital for running a pharmacy) and problem solving skills.  You have to know when and what to tell patients.  For example, my partner told a 70 year old lady (by writing it on the label) to not get pregnant while taking this medicine.  She can't figure out how to solve problems in the pharmacy.  She just sends them back on my day.  We have to cycle count the C2's every month too and I just started doing it because she kept cycle counting the wrong C2's and messing up all the counts and leaving it to me to ""reconcile"" the losses for which there were none.  And I have one of the better partners in the district!"

pharmacy,3dwy84,Elevated_Hydration,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:43 2015 UTC,"I think the communication skills test could be the best thing for an exam such as this. However, I wonder how much of education research was put into this decision. 250 pharmacy questions, with K-types and whatnot is hugely taxing, and for those who aren't fantastic test-takers this could be annoying. Sure, it's supposed to reflect your daily grind constantly being asked questions and applying yourself, but if the exam was changed in any way I think the grading criteria should change at the same time. Not this ""change the test, maybe change the p/f"" crap."

pharmacy,3dt0m4,MLS_K,10,Sun Jul 19 04:16:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not a tech, but I can try and shed some light.  Compounding pharmacies vary in what they make. Expect to learn how to make capsules, transdermals, suspensions, solutions, suppositories, animal treats, and troches to name a few. Some of these are more difficult to make than others. Some require specialized machines to prepare.  First step of making any compound is to double check the math. If you need to make #55 mL of an 8% solution, how much drug do you weigh out? If you need to make #30; 5mg capsules, how much drug do you weigh out? That's the kind of math you'll be doing.  Know what words like QS, triturate, and geometric dilution mean. Know that what you are making is going into another human being or a loved pet. Don't half ass your compounds.   Recognize that you will be working with powders which are detrimental to your health if you don't respect them. Wear gloves, hair net, and a face mask even if they are uncomfortable. Know that a surgical face mask does jack to protect you from inhaling powders so weigh and mix your powders under powder hoods.  If you have any specific questions I'd be glad to try and answer them! Good luck with your interview."
pharmacy,3dt0m4,RXCompounder,6,Sun Jul 19 12:18:53 2015 UTC,I was for 10 years!  My location actually preferred untrained techs so they could teach you how they wanted it done.  You'll be fine.  Keep a small notebook on hand and always ask questions rather than screw something up
pharmacy,3dt0m4,jPharm247,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:32:36 2015 UTC,Ditto on the notebook.
pharmacy,3dt0m4,dejanubip,4,Sun Jul 19 22:54:24 2015 UTC,"It's like baking. The pharmacy should give you a formula to follow like a recipe. Just make sure to follow the instructions carefully. As far as succeeding in the interview, research the company to try and get a grasp on what type of compounding they do. Sterile vs non-sterile, for example. Also, there are some great instructional videos from University of North Carolina on compounding that you could review prior to the interview as well. They go in depth on some of the techniques you will be using.   Just for some background... I was a compounding tech turned retail tech turned student pharmacist. I still work at both pharmacies and enjoy them for various reasons. I have little patient interaction at the compounder and focus on the physical side of pharmacy while at retail I still get to interact with our patients, some of whom are more pleasant than others. I'd say if you thrive off of interacting with your patients then compounding may be less exciting to you.  Whatever happens, good luck to you! If you have any questions feel free to message me. Compounding is a great field to work in."
pharmacy,3dt0m4,daoj0nes,4,Sun Jul 19 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"I am a pharmacy tech. I worked in retail for about 3 years, 2 of which I was doing a lot of compounding. The chain I worked for sent me to compounding class, but it honestly didn't teach me much because they try to squeeze everything into 2 days, and there's just no time to learn and try the techniques they're showing you. I did most of the learning on the job. My pharmacy manager was always happy to show me how to make things because I always showed an interest in it.   Anyway, the math required is very basic, at least it was where I worked. We had a compounding center that sent us all if the recipes which included all of the measurements and even step by step instructions for how to make everything. The most math I ever really used while compounding was to change the quantity of what I was making. Like if I need 5mg of progesterone for 100 capsules, I need Xmg for 30. (Not that I could make less than 100 capsules with our machine anyway).   We made a lot of creams, capsules, and solutions where I worked, and occasionally we'd make some troches. None of it was particularly challenging, the machines make it pretty easy, and it gets easier/quicker with practice. For the duties, I basically did everything. I choose the products, do any calculations required before measurement, then measure, have the pharmacist check the product/quantity, and then start following the recipe. I occasionally had to order chemicals and also had to clean the equipment once I was finished with it. Sorry my text is a bit disorganized, I'm on mobile and finishing up my break at the moment. Feel free to message me if you want any other details or have questions :)"
pharmacy,3dt0m4,buf_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:47 2015 UTC,Maybe learn some common displacement values for suppositories? Might make you seem geeky enough.
