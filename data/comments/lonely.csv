You need to back off and give him some space. Let him think through some things.  Just Let him do his own thing. You also need to find something or someone to distract yourself with. For lack of a better term, obsessed, or attached describes how you feel towards him. Things like this take time to change your feelings."
lonely,3e5k92,coolguy487,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:48:22 2015 UTC,"In my defense, I was in relationships with other guys for 3 out of 5 years and I would text him once or twice every six months. At one point we hadn't talked for a year. And I'm not a complete stranger to this guy. As I said before, we had classes together, a couple of lunch dates, we went on the same study abroad trip, and he went to my birthday party. I have no illusions that I will never date this guy, and although I still like him I feel like it has morphed into a) fascination because he lives an interesting life and b) physical attraction since I think he's hot. I would like to be a friend of his going forward because he's the type of person I'd like to attract in my life and I kind of use our conversations as a test-run of sorts since I've finally come out of my shell but I'm still trying to work on being conversational. My friend (the one who said it was ineffectual pining) knows this. So yes I have liked him for 5 years, and I've talked about him for 5 years but the type of ""like"" has changed over that time, I have seen other people during this time, he has returned interest over this stretch of time, and up until june I only asked him how he was doing every 6-8 months. As for things to distract myself with, I've taken up knitting, rock climbing, kick boxing, etc.and I've focused my attention on making new friends in my area."
lonely,3e5k92,Rust__,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:00:21 2015 UTC,I don't know if this will help.  But I think you should just cut all of those people out of your life. And start over if you can. Just wipe the slate clean. So you can get rid of the damaged part of you and build a better you.
lonely,3e5k92,Ravenist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:36:24 2015 UTC,"The good news is that it sounds like you're (relatively) young and you definitely have time to start fresh. It sounds like the people you're around aren't currently helping you 'heal' - instead, they're sort of half-stunting the process while heading their own way.  I agree with Rust__ on this one - find some new people to talk to, maybe just a club or some random person in school/work you may have never talked to before. Explore new hobbies, watch some movies...do something that isn't related to your current group of friends. Moving on hurts a lot too, but sometimes it's for the best.  If you really do feel your current friends are worth keeping, do it with a grain of salt, but...take some time to explore 'you' instead of 'them'. There's plenty of ways to find happiness, even when you're alone. If you're happy for even a second while lonely, consider that a victory."
lonely,3e5k92,Fartface-Bedwetter,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:36:13 2015 UTC,"I think I just want more out of friendships I cultivate than my current friends want to give. As my friend told me, (the one mentioned in this post) she takes what she can get in terms of friendship. She's okay with having a number of acquaintances, etc. If people don't invite her out but still text her, she's fine with just being their ""texting friend"". However I think that she's lying about this to cover the fact that this comes from her own anxieties and insecurities than anything else. The last day of college, several people told her that she was known as ""lemonelephant's friend"" or ""the girl always with lemonelephant"". I try to put a ton of work into friendships, trying over and over again to make the relationship stronger, to know more about my friends, etc. If anything, that's my real problem. It takes a lot for me to give up on a friendship, and as long as I see something positive I keep trying to make it work. I'm working on that part of myself though."

Lurk the 'net or other subreddits like /r/dating_advice/ - they might have something to say. If your parents are still together in a healthy relationship and you're willing to bite that bullet, ask them, even; you might be surprised to hear what they can say.   And above all, I hope you know out there that's there's someone out there hoping you have a happy birthday.

I'm in College and talking to random people can be pretty difficult at times as the other person might be shy, introverted, lacking of interests or just doesn't want to talk.   I'm pretty young but I find that the older the person is the more easier it is to strike a conversation compared to younger people.   I'm not much of a helper, I can't even help myself.

lonely,3e1my4,doubleyouwhy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:48:04 2015 UTC,"Wow man, you sound just like me a while back. I served 2007-2011. After I discharged, I spent a few years coping through depression and life adjustments. I thought I would be happy when I left, but switching over from a career like that back into the civilian world was one of the hardest parts of my life, probably harder than boot camp.  There's something about military service that only other military people will understand. When you're in, all people talk about is wanting to get out. Once you're out, you realize that those were some fun ass years. No doubt it's a huge shift in lifestyle when you leave. No more fitness tests, haircuts, upper management BS. But the camaraderie... I think you will miss that the most, and it's something that can't really be replicated in the civilian world.   I later realized that it's not the end of the world. Even though I don't feel that same love from the guys in the civilian world, I'd gladly treat them like my buddies in the military if they were my friend. That's the best I can do. I also try to catch up with my old buddies at least once a year on social media. It sounds somewhat depressing that it's reduced to this, but the ones that I was closest with know that we are buddies for life. At the same time, we all got our own stuff and our own lives going on.  The thing with purpose is that in the military, you were always told what to do. Your purpose was clearly defined, every single day, by some other person. When you leave, that responsibility is given back to you. Going to college right after discharge was exactly what I did. It gave me some time to think about what I wanted to do, and get paid while learning.   While you're enrolled in college, spend that time thinking about what you want to do in your life. Anything you want, just think of something, and set your sights on making it a reality. I spent the first two years screwing around, getting Cs and dropping a lot of classes. Speak with a VA counselor, or any counselor, regularly so you can stay on course. Don't stop thinking about what you want to do, and who you want to be. Knowing that is so important to doing well in school, especially if it's something that you really want.  But ultimately, just give it some time, and eventually I think you'll understand why your decision to discharge was a good call."

From personal experience, sometimes you find flaws you'd hate on everyone else but love deeply just because that particular person managed to turn them into something good.   Just a loner's 2 cents, admittedly, but I wish you the best of luck with your relationships."

That is not easy, so you had done amazingly well for it to last five months. Dealing with a breakup is unfortunately, never easy. Do you have any friends, either in person or online that you could talk to for a bit?   Your steam friend may have deleted you under the influence of alcohol, would be my guess. Do yous have mutual friends, one of which you could ask how he is doing and if they have spoken to him? Maybe he did it by accident and is regretting his action. I've had steam friends under the influence of alcohol do stupid things in the past, but some apologies lately and everything is made better.

Its not easy at all. Trust me, I know what you've gone through and so much more. Unlike you, I met my girlfriend twice, and I had to make lots of sacrifices to do so. We're having serious issues with the relationship right now, but this post is about you, not me. You can PM me if you want talk more though.   All I can say is that you're not alone. By that I mean that these feelings you're suffering from, this hardship, other people out there are suffering from the same thing and worse. Your needs are very valid and I'm sure someone out there is waiting to meet you and love you. Don't give up.   As for your guy friends. I don't understand what happened to the second guy. I don't just delete people like that for no reason. A woman has to do something really awful to get me to do that. Like for example, I had a classmate call in to phonesex despite the fact she already knew I was in a relationship. Some people just have no respect at all. Him though, I don't know, but don't beat yourself up for it. Its not your fault. Neither the breakup or the dude vanishing.   Again, if you wanna talk, I'm just a short PM away. :)"

lonely,3dz0ji,slightlyjealousjedi,4,Mon Jul 20 22:40:08 2015 UTC,I fear being alone. Because I basically am.  My parents don't want much to do with me as well as family. I can't seem to find a girlfriend at all in the 10+ years I've been trying and all my friends are busy living their lives and starting family's. So I feel alone and don't have anyone to really talk to who understands what its like. So I found this amazing site called reddit and while I am alone and live constantly in that paralyzing fear of being alone. Browsing reddit reminds me that I'm not alone.

I know with what I have been going through / putting myself through (whatever), I have been avoiding writing, reaching out, talking.  Anything.  And as much as my insane self might wish otherwise, that bottling is only making it worse for me.    I had the opportunity to walk El Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage of 500 miles across Spain with my brother and father.  Unsurprisingly it was often monotonous, pain-filled, and filled with my mental storm, but also beautiful and hard and there were probably a few good moments.  Definitely.  Anyway.  We'd meet fellow peregrinos (pilgrims, not falcons) pass some time from a few minutes to hours, occasionally seeing some a few times.  On parting, we'd wish each other ""Buen camino!""  I think it translates basically to ""have a good walk"" or ""have a good journey"".  But the name of the pilgrimage ""El Camino de Santiago"" is most often translated as the ""Way of St. James.""  I don't know if it had the same intended double meaning of the word ""way"", but anyway I like that it could.    I wish this for you, for me, and for everyone, may we have a buen camino.

lonely,3dpsuu,Howdiditgo81,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:16:35 2015 UTC,"Generally I give my honest opinion to people that really need it.   I'll make the exception for you.  Stop being a pussy.   First and foremost you dont need a fucking girlfriend. Whatever reasoning you've got for why I'm wrong is invalid, because I've been there. In those same clown shoes you're going to laugh at your self for being in in less than a year and a half. Seriously, clownin' dude.   Secondly, what in the fuck makes you so worried about your friends? If any one of them was your friend you wouldn't be here, and the fact that they left you hanging for whatever he said/she said bullshit made them decide to exclude you in the first place should make it obvious that people are fickle. I'm more of a friend to you than they are, and I'm straight calling you out on acting like you lost your nuts. Literally lostem.  Lastly, you should be worried about your own business. So what you dont have a girl? Good, you should learn to know and love your self before you expect a single person to do the same. So what those fucking geeks dipped out and you're looking out the window like you're grounded for life. Stop. Just stop. The only one making you not have fun is you. If you weren't so afraid to break out of your circle you would find that new people are fucking AWESOME.   In summary, quit being a little bitch bro. Go find something to do.   P.S. Please, for the love of God, save this and send it back to me with a reply after your freshman year."

Just a jog or a run can do wonders sometimes, getting out of the house in general helps tons.  Social anxiety can be tough, and I'm no expert on how to deal with it but it seems like looking for something you're passionate about and trying to find groups of people who share it is a good way to start. It can be anything, sports (join a rec league), books (local book store, library, comic store), games (board game stores, and they usually have drop in game nights that are fun and stress free. Or video games, if your username says anything about if you're into those.) It's a lot easier to deal with the anxiety if you're in a place you feel comfortable or doing something you enjoy with others.  And now I have those Patapon chants stuck in my head.  Good luck!"

lonely,3dp3cm,jawbrain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:47:20 2015 UTC,"That sounds terrible. Did your ex leave you because of your weight gain, or is it something else? Some people are like that. It's depressing.  When it comes to personal image, sometimes you just gotta own it. Most people don't see the imperfections you might see, and most good people don't care.  Changing your appearance can be a nice way to boost confidence. In a day I went from being a kid with an emo cut to a somewhat fashionable hairstyle and a bunch of new confidence came with it :)! I made new friends and even got my first girlfriend!  I'm not a girl so I can't really guide you on changing your appearance, but I can say if it gives you confidence that's a good thing.  Be confident in yourself, accept your flaws, and realize life is a journey. You can do this, and at least one person believes in you: and that's me! I'm sure your kids love you too. And your family.  I know the deal with social anxiety too :( try meeting more people online, that usually works for me. Read some books, try meditation, etc.  I believe in you!! Please!!"
lonely,3dp3cm,PickleShaman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:24:53 2015 UTC,"Virtual hug for you. Firstly you have to want to better yourself, for yourself. Not for anyone else. Not to impress men. Not to seek compliments from people. Not to attract more friends. But solely to love yourself more, and be more proud of your own potential. I am a tomboy too, I wear oversized shirts and don't put on any makeup except for some basic foundation or concealer when I feel like it. But that's who I am and if certain guys don't find it attractive, fuck it, it's their own problem. When you are confident you naturally look more charming. It's not all about being girly. :)  Stay strong darling. Life is hard for many people, but we just have to live through it and hopefully undersand its true meaning one day."

All I can truly say is that there are many, many forms of happiness-- and that even though it seems impossible to find yours, the mere act of searching for it can make things better. It is a great quest! One not to be taken lightly, for it is actually the meaning of it all.  Don't give up. Time will pass, and along with it, feelings.

Sometimes we have to just let it all out.  Sometimes it's the smallest things that make us happy. A rainy day, an ending to a movie you just watched, fresh clean sheets on your bed, eating your favorite dessert. Try looking for those smaller things instead of just one big thing.

We even acknowledged each other as friends recently, but she goes often and comes rarely on the sole chatroom we keep touch on now, and as hard as I try to make new friends, they haven't been really understanding to me.

I don't have the closeness of close friends or the closeness of being lovers, and it just...sucks on so many levels I just don't know where to begin.

It's only been as of today that I've started to feel happiness by myself again, thanks to some people and going-ons on reddit in general.  Take your life one day at a time; there are definitely days where everything will feel hopeless and you'll feel like nothing is getting better at all. I don't know how or when you'll feel it, but time does inevitably heal wounds - sometimes that healing just comes at a snail's pace.  As for believing - sometimes it's better to just enjoy what you have while you have it.  To me, ""happy endings"" aren't to be taken for granted, and the ones that do occur in my life I consider gifts, even if that means I inevitably lose a friend.

lonely,3dd8zv,i_sigh_less,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:23 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting idea. I've been considering hiring a local prostitute just to cuddle with me for a few hours, but I wonder if a stripper would do that instead. I'm not really sure if a lapdance is what I want, honestly. But who knows?"
lonely,3dd8zv,i_sigh_less,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:53:30 2015 UTC,"Well, a lapdance will leave you feeling just as frustrated, but at least you'll have had a lapdance."
lonely,3dd8zv,Lovelycorpse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:01:36 2015 UTC,"That is actually a really brilliant idea. I don't know why I didn't think of that myself. I was a stripper for about six months (I had just graduated college and couldn't get a job doing anything. It was a good solution until I didn't want to put up with it anymore) and most of the men I interacted with were there for the company. They were my favorite customers actually because I understand loneliness and am a good listener.  You don't have to get a lap dance. As long as you are respectful and pay her for her time you can just sit together and talk.   Seriously, if you want advice on this just ask me."
lonely,3dd8zv,Lovelycorpse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"Wow that sounds awesome! I'll definitely consider doing just that if I need someone to talk to. Also you sound like an amazing person to be able to help lonely people like that.  But what I'd really like is to be able to cuddle with someone, or at least hug them for a really long time. Like make physical contact with them and get the oxytocin feeling of bonding. Do you think a stripper would be willing to do that?"
lonely,3dd8zv,ottertherock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:44:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I think loneliness is the main reason the sex industry exists. I was much happier with those customers than the dirty old men. -_-  That's definitely possible! It does depend on the laws in your state/county. I know some counties are very strict and are completely no contact. And you need to find the right girl. Just be upfront and ask if she would be ok with sitting on your lap and talking, that you aren't interested in a lap dance but still want to pay her for her time. And don't feel pressured to settle for an older ragged looking one lol it's sad but true.  If scouting the girls yourself is too intimidating you can talk to a manager. It's still a customer service industry so they're nice and happy to help as long as you aren't rude."
lonely,3dd8zv,warmBlack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:19:54 2015 UTC,"I prefer to drop the money on escorting or going to the brothels, the reason is with strippers you have the dopamine surge but you can't cum and your penis will just be urging for release. But with escorts you can have some cuddles and sex. It is legal where I'm from ""Australia"" $250 for 1 hour of girl friend experience, but after you finish and you or she leaves, the next 7 days will impact your brain severely as you will feel even more lonely than you were before and you become more desperate seeking out that experience again.   What can you do, just hope one day you will have some one by your side and live together till the day you die."
lonely,3daqqr,Potated,4,Tue Jul 14 20:39:21 2015 UTC,"Hey mate, I know a lot of things look bleak currently. The world is a huge, huge, huge place. I still can't even comprehend it sometimes. It's why you've gotta take your little piece of it and chisel away at it slowly to make it yours. I understand the place you're in, laying in bed always feels like a comfortable place, even when you're feeling low. Your parents and your wife most likely want to understand, they want to help, and they want you to be okay. Sometimes, we feel like no one cares because no one can tell how we actually feel. A lot of folks who've been close to me were shocked when I told them I've been depressed/suicidal for so many years.   The best way to work on your loneliness is to reach out, find some people who you can enjoy some time with, even if it's only every now and again. Knowing you've got folks to rely on is nice. Perhaps try and get referred to a therapist? I know it's tough to open up to a complete stranger, but they can definitely help. The best way to help yourself is to push your way through the fog, and your friends and family are more than willing to help, they just need to know how they can.  Of course, my inbox is always open, and you're more than welcome to message me in case you just need someone to talk to. I can definitely relate."

Try not to be too upset with your friends, maybe they took the negativity in a different way and don't quite understand depression? I'm sure they just aren't understanding how you really feel right now and didn't know how to deal with it.  How about trying something to reconnect with your wife? It's a great first step. Unfortunately I've never been married so I'm not sure what it's like but, it could be as simple as finding a new TV show for the both of you to watch together. It will help. I read your comments below and I see you really love her. I'm sure it would mean the world to her if you got her some flowers and told her just how much she means to you. She sounds wonderful. I'm sure she wants to help you.   I'm sorry you feel you don't have anyone to lean on right now. Just know there's people here, like myself, who know what you're going through and are always here to talk when you need it. You're not ugly nor unwanted. Depression is ugly and unwanted. It makes us look at everything in the worst way including ourselves. Just take it day by day. I really do hope the best for you."

lonely,3daqqr,calvinballMVP,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"It's okay to feel that way friend.  You are a human and this world is really hard.  Being without work is a very hard thing that I understand too well right now.  I think I found some work at a local restaurant washing dishes so things are looking up!  Being productive makes you feel good and although it is the hardest thing you can do right now, tomorrow while you are laying there think about something you want to do and if you can make any steps in your day to get closer to it.  I am sorry you feel disconnected from your wife.  Sometimes when I get low I like to try to do something nice for someone.  Seeing someone you care about be happy about something you did for them might help your mood.  I have never been married, so it's likely I don't understand how a marriage works.  Maybe you can do something nice for her like draw a picture , write her a letter, or pick her some flowers.  The gesture might remind her that you still love her and make her see that you are hurting right now.  Regardless, you have value and you have worth.  Don't ever forget that.  No matter what anyone tells you.  I hope you find something that can ignite your desire to enjoy your life again.  I believe in you!"

She is not that great with emotions and is going through enough. I don't want my depression to burden her.  She knows I have no real lust for life anymore, she even knows that I think of suicide a lot.  She is just about the only thing I care for in this world. My state has become so bad that I would not blame her if she left. I feel so lost."

Burdening other people is a concern I have with myself as well.  I bet your love for her is stronger than the burden she would carry if she didn't have you.  My biggest hope for my future is that I am able to find someone that will love me enough that when I have my stormy thoughts, that I will realize that I don't want to miss a day to love them even more.  I am sorry that you deal with thoughts of suicide.  There have been days when those though creep into my mind as well.  How I deal with them is by listing things I will miss out on if I were to do something like that.  Keep fighting those thoughts that want to take you away from your loved ones.  They deserve you and you deserve them."

lonely,3dbfgn,Neo_Lux,2,Tue Jul 14 23:39:49 2015 UTC,"In your attempt to rationalize your loneliness you've mistakenly associated aspects of friendship as delusion. Notice that you've only attributed these qualities to the aspects of friendship after the friendship died but during your loneliness. It isn't some revelation that you've discovered. In your attempt to accept loneliness you've vilified friendship. If what you say about friendship is true, you should feel relief now that this friendship has died, but instead you feel lonely.  So really your question is based on the false premise that friendship is a delusion, therefore I have no answer to no question.  Could it be true that the only way to experience deep happiness is to engage in a healthy relationship? No. But it sure helps."

lonely,3dbfgn,thevoidabove,2,Wed Jul 15 07:02:58 2015 UTC,"I partly agree. I think it's the distraction from ourselves and our problems that can give us happiness. I have a friend who is a major extrovert, as soon as they got to a stagnant place in life (moved, new job, etc ) they quickly became depressed cause they didn't know what to do with themselves and without all their distractions they were more aware of their current state in life. As for me, I am an introvert and enjoy time alone but still distract myself with hobbies. That's my happy place.  Ignorance is bliss"

lonely,3dbfgn,_Hessian_,2,Sat Jul 18 22:04:24 2015 UTC,"no. life is what you make of it. the richest people can be the most miserable, and the poorest people can be the most happiest. true happiness really does come from within. its hard to find it but its there. focus on something that you enjoy doing for yourself that makes you happy. then focus on getting friends which also make you happy. for me, i hate meaningless small talk chats and social formalities like that, but i have made a few very close friends with which i can talk about interesting topics and bounce opinions off of and that makes me happy. you need to find people who you can connect with on a deeper level. and it seems like the relationship with your friend wasnt too serious. they seem more like an acquaintance from your description."

I missed a lot of fun times with friends doing this.  I don't know if I was depressed or just feeling sorry for myself and being lazy so our situations may differ.  I wasn't invited to a dear friends bachelor party because of this but I went to his wedding reception and they still talked to me and we had a lot of fun.  It's okay if you feel bad about it.  It shows how much they mean to you.  Always remember that no matter what, you have value and worth and this world hopes you stick around as long as you can.

I have struggled my whole life to be taken seriously and I rarely am today.  I can be discouraged by this but I can't give up.  Tomorrow could be a gamechanger.  Tomorrow holds the potential for you to get to be a happier person.  Sometimes when I get gloomy and blue, I like to take a simple inventory of the things I have that some other don't.  I have eyes that see sunrises and ears that can hear beautiful music.  I have hands that can feel the soft fur of my mom's cats and legs that let me go anywhere I decide to point them.  I can smell pizza cooking and taste it too.  These little points help me from feeling like the outside world is crushing me.  I really hope you can find some peace, you deserve it.

I just want you to know that it is ok to feel what you are feeling.  Losing someone you cared about can hurt so much.  I want to tell you that this hurt can get better.  I felt deeply betrayed by someone I cared for and still struggle somedays to look past it.  I know that if I don't, that anger will keep me from finding happiness for myself.  I deserve some happiness and that means you do too.  Healing often doesn't come quick, but it can come.  It's great that you have therapist to share your thoughts with and I am sure they can help you.  I like to do something I enjoy when I feel down.  One time when I felt really blue, I took a whole 20$ bill to McDonald's and told myself I could spend it all.  I got a bunch of food with extras I never though I would ever try.  I had a Quarter Pounder with extra cheese and added bacon to it.  I got a Grilled Cheese even!  Granted it is not the most healthy outlet and if you are fitness buff I probably just grossed you out.  My point is to do something within reason that makes you have a day you look back on.  You can do this and don't believe anyone who says you can't.  You have value and you have worth.  Go chase something you want.  Good luck friend!"

It got me really nervous and feeling even more alone, but I'm trying a new approach now - try to enjoy what I have. Yeah I might be messed up and have no one that can understand me, but who gives a damn? I got 2 tickets for me and my friend to a metal concert, I volunteer in a place I love with kids that love me and music is still there for me. I want to accept the fact that I'm not normal. I think that will help me get along better in life and find happiness. Just try to find the things I love and really try to make those things happen.  Thank you, random internet person.

I'm sure that you do have redeeming qualities, maybe you just need to spend some time thinking about what they are.   Have you spoken to anyone about your suicidal thoughts?"
lonely,3d3uun,SleepyAdmiral,0,Tue Jul 14 11:55:35 2015 UTC,"I used to have someone that liked me a lot too, but that person left me for someone who was far more interesting and jerkish, to put it lightly. Currently single, not sure if I'll be getting back into the romance scene in a while.  Personally, I think it's kind of hard to find positive feelings while a 'better' person is around you, especially one in a relationship. It makes reflecting hard; I'm currently a mod on the same forum the aforementioned people in my post frequent, and despite having just organized a massive ruleset rework for a game played there among other throw-into-work attempts, I still feel like I can't compare to the other guy. Heck, typing this post now makes me realize that I probably need new places to go, but some laughable sense of duty and a failure to make friends anywhere else keeps me stuck there.  Do you have any places where you can just be away from your brother for a period of time? From experience, places like those can help you start looking for things to do that don't fall under his 'shadow'."

lonely,3d1x1v,LonelyZeta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:33:30 2015 UTC,"I'm probably not qualified to give advice, but I'll try my best anyways.   Why do you want to be loved? To feel happy, right? Doesn't that mean that what you really want is happiness and not to be loved? You're using ""being loved"" as the means to attain happiness. You can be happy right now when you realize that happiness is really feeling at peace, feeling that everything is alright.   Your boyfriend dumped you, but how do you know this is a bad outcome for sure? Maybe him dumping you is what you need to encourage yourself to go out and find someone who is a better fit for you. We don't know what the future holds, but you don't either. Maybe he thinks that someone else can make him happy, but he'll soon realize that if he's using people to make him happy, he'll never be happy, because people just don't have that power. Were you happy in every single moment he was your boyfriend? Did you suddenly stop feeling doubts, insecurities, worries about the future, worries about whether he loves you or not, worries about anything. Did you suddenly stop feeling all those bad emotions throughout all the time he was your boyfriend? I don't know you, but I'm sure you didn't. You still felt those things while he was your boyfriend. This tells us that a boyfriend doesn't have the power to make you happy.   Only you can make yourself happy. Maybe you can use this experience to better yourself as a person and realize these things for yourself. If you wanna talk some more, I'll be here. I wish you well."

I know that I want to be happy and that someone loving me will not solve my problems, but I still can't shake that feeling that I need to be loved by others in order to be happy. I also know I should love myself and I try, I really do, but it's not something that you just decide and then suddenly it works.   This damn loneliness and need for comfort, attention and physical intimacy sucks so much, it ruins my chance at having friendships with women since I always feel sad after doing something with them, probably because I want more out of our friendship - not because I'm in love with them (or am I? I can't fucking tell) but because I just want anybody to love me... Fuck, this is all so hard. Sorry for ranting."

Especially since your ex was abusive you'll soon find out that he was sapping your life.  You might still feel awful, but as you rediscover everything good about yourself that he was taking from you the pain will fade.  I know it's hard to see this now but you've been given a great opportunity.  Bad experiences allow us to learn about life and make choices about how we live our lives.

The few times I've seen someone I might even connect with, they've either never shown up again, or showed much more interest in more douchebaggy people. Hell I even went to an event where the women in the singles group were hitting on non-members. Meanwhile there's been (guy) members sitting there alone going, why the fuck am I here.

I know it seems like you will never find someone but it really takes time.  I am 30 and only have had one girlfriend years ago.  I loved her but I wasn't cut out for the job.  Before I met her, I felt much like you.  In high school, I was voted ""Least Likely to get Married"".  That stung and still does but I don't give up.  Then one day that gal came into my life.  Although it did not work out and the relationship really wasn't a good one, it did show to me that as least it is possible for someone to think I am worthy enough to have someone to try to love me.  It is hard for me many days and I drink heavily to cope, but I know that it is fully possible that tomorrow will be the day that someone special comes into my life.  That can happen for you too.  Tomorrow may be the day that you meet that special someone.  Chin up and keep going.  You have value and you have worth.  You can do this.  You can be loved.

lonely,3cx2s8,Ithrowtheshoes,2,Sun Jul 12 01:21:45 2015 UTC,A byproduct of depression is the avoidance of resolution. The first step is accepting help and determining if you really want to feel this way forever. If the answer is no your option is extreme change. Psychiatrists don't fix your problems. They show you that all of the answers are right in front of you. If you have ever considered getting help then you have at least decided that you won't accept this cycle. Continue this trend and ride this fucking thing to the finish line. Face your fears or crumble underneath them. You weren't given a beautiful mind just to let it get away from you. Call your doctor and tell him you changed your mind. You deserve better for your self.
lonely,3cx2s8,Ithrowtheshoes,2,Mon Jul 13 23:34:28 2015 UTC,may I ask what psychiatrist did to help me? What actually he/she doing?  Can I fix my own problem by myself?

A psychiatrist will show you that. They will help you to understand your self, and help identify a lot of things that you have been overlooking. They do it because they want to understand humans better and help people along the way, not to look down upon those that are brave enough to admit that they want help. You have nothing to fear but looking your self in the mirror. You need to be ready to face your self. Once you are there, you are well on your way to a better life. I promise"

All the new people I met ended up avoiding or ignoring me and the few people I considered my ""friends"" distanced themselves away from me. A couple of guys from school would bully me and even some of my family members didn't seem to enjoy my presence. Naturally, I thought all these people had to just ""deal with it"" and ""accept me for who I was"", since I considered myself to be ""different"", ""special"". The thing is, nobody has the obligation to be anyone's friends.  It wasn't until I hit rock bottom that I asked myself the question: ""What if I'm the problem?"". That's when I realized I had been a dick to all those people the whole time. Whenever I was around someone -anyone, really, even people on the Internet- I would try to show off my ""superior"" intelligence: I would insult them or laugh at them if they didn't know something I knew, I would speak using ""complicated"" words that they might not understand just to make them feel inferior, I would belittle them when they made any ortographic or grammatical mistakes...  It got even worse when I discovered atheism. Just because I had read some books and watched a couple of Richard Dawkins documentaries, I considered myself an expert in the field. I would constantly try to debate (unwilling) religious people on their beliefs, and I would mock them if they didn't end up agreeing with me that atheism was ""the only way to go"". Even my poor grandma had to suffer through all my attacks against Christianity.  After my ""epiphany"", for lack of a better word, I decided I had to change. I stopped laughing at others and started treating them as equals. If someone doesn't know something, I'm more than happy to explain it to them. Respecting others, even when they are being assholes, is my #1 priority. I'm still an atheist, but I never, NEVER bring that up unless someone actively asks me about it. Religious beliefs are a very personal thing and nobody should have the right to change those of other people by force (or ""erase"" them, as I would call it).  Since then, I'm much happier; my life has improved exponentially. I made new friends, I recovered some of the old ones and I don't feel like people hate me anymore.  I don't know if any of this applies to you, but I hope it can be useful to someone.  tl;dr: Be nice to other people and they'll be nice to you. Don't ridicule them if their knowledge/experience/beliefs are different than yours. You will be happier."

Maybe it would help if you talked to him about this.  He could help you if he has a group of friends and makes friends easily.  Maybe you would get along with some of his friends or some of his friends' girlfriends. Try asking him if he could organize double dates maybe.   One way to make new friends is to try taking a class in something you are interested in like an exercise class (yoga, zoomba, martial arts), art, singing, cake decorating, acting, guitar, language class, etc. I know you are on a limited budget but sometimes you can find inexpensive versions of these things. Also, you could try to join a book club or hiking club or another regular meeting group on meetup.com, these would be free.  Do you currently have any hobbies you like that you could try to meet other people through?  If you can come up with a hobby or place where there are a lot of people, you'll then have to actually get to know them and start inviting them to do other things. If you aren't active about this the hobbies themselves wont really lead to friendships. Most of us aren't very good at meeting new people, despite how it seems from the outside. This book helped me a little, but the big thing is just being willing to put yourself out there. You can't really build new connections unless you're willing to put yourself out there and risk rejection, most of the people you meet wont be your new best friend, but its worth working at it.   Don't put expectations too high on yourself or be hard on yourself if things don't work out.  You mentioned you tried going out on your own but it didn't work out well. This is a really hard thing to do! You shouldn't expect it to end in amazing friendships the first time you try.  Maybe one day you are on your own just make it a goal to talk to one person, then next time make it a goal to talk to a few people, then the next time to have a longer conversation, then eventually to meet a new friend who you ask to meet for a coffee some time, etc.  As for meaningful connections, it may take a long time.  Meaningful connections aren't easy to build, and take a long time for most people, so you have to be patient.

I rarely talk to my family as well so someday I feel like I just want to disappear from this lonely planet, but you know what it's just a bad day. Tomorrow might be better. and yes doing things alone sucks but it's not that bad.

lonely,3crs1w,myconfessionacc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:34:17 2015 UTC,"Welcome to panic disorder. I used to get hundreds of panic attacks a day. My grandmother and my mother both suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. It's a crippling cycle but I will share what helped me.   First, find a Tibetan Buddhist temple. You'll make friends, learn to meditate AND learn about anxiety/existential dread. Humans are feeble creatures suspended between our will to live and our knowledge of impending death. It's an incredible spiritual flux. This ""flux"" is what philosophers refer to as cognitive dissonance. This dissonance is so intense that we use illusionary heroic structures within culture to expand our ego and repress dread. The problem is we create a symbolic self that we believe will satisfy our cultures symbolic hero only to fall short.   Humans have this incredible ability to create altered states of consciousness by transcending time. We can reflect on past events and project ourselves into the future. This is why we achieve but this also why we fail. If we reflect too much into the past then we enter a depressed state. If we project our symbolic self to the future it creates a state of anticipation, worry, dread, anxiety and panic. The here and now is fertile grounds for a healthy ego. The here and now is a garden of awe. Awe is the opposite of dread. Imagine watching a spectacular display of fireworks! The awe of something so beautiful grounded you in the here and now. A beautiful sunrise shattering the skies in lights. An event so splendid you stop your car and just enjoy. At first it will be difficult to find sources of awe but eventually you'll find it everywhere. Of course we must still project to the future and create a symbolic self or else how can we achieve! We also must reflect to understand how we have failed or else we'll never grow. Just understand why we reflect and project and be acutely aware of when you enter these altered states.   Meditation is a practice of grounding yourself in the here and now without awe. It takes practice, time and patience. I missed out on three years of middle school due to panic. I'm okay with that though. Without panic disorder I would of never studied psychology, neuropsychology or philosophy. The tough question you must ask yourself is: "" did this woman hurt me?"". Sometimes it is our idealism that hurts us, not the person.   Take care. I'm typing on a phone so please excuse grammatical errors."

We've now been apart longer than we were together, and just the other day, I had a dream about her coming back. It's been two years now. I know how you're feeling.   About the only thing I'm sure of is that, despite how clichéd it sounds, time does make it better. I'm much better than I was when we'd been apart three months. That's really not that long, so don't feel odd about still missing her. Give yourself time to grieve. Losing someone you love is very similar to experiencing a death . In a way it's worse because you know they have left you voluntarily.  You will meet other women if you just live your life. All of my relationships were born out of circumstances rather than an active search for love. Let yourself be open to new experiences and don't isolate yourself.   I wish you well.

But five years ago my health began to decline. It's become so hard to keep myself busy and distracted. I got a dog and it helped a lot (I was doing really reallllly badly). Now I'm an attractive single 25 year old female who has a chronic degenerative illness and lives with her parents. I don't have close friends. I don't know how to make local friends here. I just hang out with my dog and see my grandparents every couple of weeks.  Every once in a while in the past I would get that longing for a boyfriend, but I could always make it go away after a bit. Being in a serious long term relationship or marriage wasn't anything I thought about. For a year (or more) now I haven't been able to make the longing go away. Even though I'm still just as cold as I've always been. Knowing my illness makes me undesirable makes the loneliness ache worse, that forever alone ache.

I personally believe it that this is just negative thinking, I noticed this post, so now those that mean you're not invisible? I don't want to sound to harsh, but I'm not ready to classify humans as anything other than humans. I recall by senior year of University, and I was so busy, there were always labs, assignments or some kind of application that needed to be filled. Throughout the entire day, the only time I was out of my lab was while I was walking to the lab,and that rare coffee break at 6 in the evening. So people might not be ignoring you as much as just trying to do their best along the path of life they've chosen. Of course, we live in a society where the attention span is now limited to 144 characters, what more could you except.   There is in your post a sense of judging other people, through assigning them as decision on their behalf. You can't do that, for you to accurately gauge their reaction to you, you need to wait for them to respond. I know what I'm saying is a bit cliche but hear me out, there are many opportunities where we could just hide away we take what's given to us, but we speak out. Now you say that when you speak out you get shot down, try again, and this time yell louder, and when people ignore you, forget about them, they weren't worth your time anyway! You have so much to offer why would you try pleasing people that won't give you the time of day?  All I can say, if you're already trying to get yourself heard out there, is to find what interests you, what are your goals, what you want to do, and stop thinking that others don't care, it's true that some don't, but there are many who will. Be spontaneous, I remember this one time when I told this girl in the line at Timmy's, that her backpack looked super cool, and got shot down, of course she has a right of refusing me, but what I didn't need to do was to over exaggerate the situation in my head. I guess I told myself, that she didn't look like the ""type"" to refuse compliments, a very rude, and demeaning view to have of her, and was thus more hurt than I needed to be. Here's where my problem was, I had judged her before I made my advance, if I had thought, like how it really is, that she is a girl, and I'm a boy, and after all I'm complimenting her self-made backpack, not offering her the fucking world, then I would have been able to keep myself from a couple of really depressing days. I guess what I want to emphasize is to stop think of yourself as invisible, people want to hear you, but they have their own problems, and if you join their ranks then there is a shy boy/girl that will never get noticed because you gave up a long time ago! We understand where you coming from, but it really can't be helped, you just have to have faith that your life is yours for the making, and there is no way that you're sabotaging it!"

You have to ask yourself, why do you think that everyone thinks of you as being happy? Is because you have a great career, or a lot of material goods, or is it that they really don't give a fuck about you, and if that's the case then why should you care about how they see you. Opening up to someone is one of the most time consuming endeavors one can undertake, you have to spend day in, day out, providing consolidation, and partaking in their activities. It's not easy, and trust me, when those types of relationships pass you'll feel you'll burnt out.   You have recognized a really key aspect to combat loneliness though, which is talking about your feeling to others. It's a truly odd statement, but everyone is going through challenging times throughout their lives, so you're not alone there. However many of the these challenges don't even come close to the challenges others face, and when we realize that we can breath some fresh air. Now on the other hand, if you're anything like me, then you want people to come to you, you don't want to influence any of the judgement, because of you're honesty, and that is to be appreciated. But at the same time you need to take some challenges, as I said earlier taking the time to get to know people, has many highs and lows, and that's what knowing someone entails. Likewise, there needs to an effort on your part to establish a type of connect, or let's say facilitate a situation, through which other can meet you. Of course if you like anything like me then, you'll be like ""screw this"", as would I be if someone gave me this advice, but alas I see no way to overcome it. Another great idea would be to interest yourself in a hobby, this makes the chance of meeting someone a lot easier, because now you have something of a shared interest to talk about. That prison comment you made rung close to home for me, and I really did feel that for a long time, but you have accept that you did what was best for you, and you had this thinking while you carried out these decisions, which you believe led to this current state. But again, the only way out that I see is opening up to someone close to you, and even that is easier than said than done, like if you call up your friend from High School, and be like ""Dude, I need some company"", the response will probably be a hangup. You need to do this for yourself, and for your mental well-being. You seem like a ridiculously strong person for being able to help others while, keeping your feelings in check. Given help is much better than receiving it, trust me, I mean another way you could curb this feeling is to get involved in charity events, the act of thinking that you're making the world a better place for others, is something very  medicinal. Keep on giving that kindness though, at the same time try to find the reason that you feel like this, probably you'll realize that being that solid person people you know can turn to is doing you a lot of good. Finally try to keep a diary, the weapon of choice for the super-isolationists, there you can record your thoughts and get them released, instead of banging around inside making you miserable. I hope you find a resolution to this state, but if it's any help there is someone else in the world suffering from something similar."

It can be good to be alone and to get to know yourself. But sometimes it can be hard too. But don't be too hard on yourself. Try just play an online game, or watch a serie or something.

lonely,3cf74z,orphan26,2,Tue Jul 7 18:54:51 2015 UTC,it's normal as counter intuitive it may sound. just doesn't work out since the other party will want more out of a relationship/friendship
lonely,3cf74z,monkeyMan1992,2,Tue Jul 7 14:16:35 2015 UTC,"You're completely normal, if not part of the majority. You are honest with yourself, and that's to be commended. I went through a similar type of situation when I was in grade 12, probably precipitated by the moved to college, but I had this yearning for someone else, someone I could rely on, share secrets with, and even cuddle with. After thinking about this situation I found myself in, for months I realized I needed a higher purpose, I needed a goal in life, I needed a spark, something that would keep me going, and dull the mundane cycle of life. I really resented people, mainly because I saw most people as inherently dishonest, one day they'll be laughing together and the next day, they'll have slept with the other's boyfriend, I didn't need that shit. Unfortunately, I live in the same irrational world as you, and while for many years now I've focused entirely on my work, shunning the few chances at a social life I got, there really is not answer, other than making an online friend, someone who you'll be sharing your distresses, the highs and lows in your days, and a lot of other stupid stuff. However that's as close as your gonna get, as far as I know, you'll be safe-guarded by the formalities of social convention, and being able to feel adored by your online friend. I get this feeling that you've either been very loyal to the people you've known, and they haven't reciprocated it, but that's just the way the world works! However bear in mind that once you become comfortable with people like yourself, you'll be able to have some that relies on you, and be able to sit an entire evening without talking, it has to do more with contentment, than loneliness, that's what I think, but you're question is very deep, and I'm at a lose for words.   Summary: Challenge yourself, for me this was accomplished by reading a lot of philosophical books, I guess I craved this dimension of spiritual nourishment that I wasn't providing my mind. Know that the need to talk to others is something that we can limit, but not suppress completely. Unfortunately you are one of those poor souls who has questioned the world, thought about what's best for you, and not ""gone with wind"", and as such, you're destined for a life seeing things as they actually are.   I apologize I wasn't able to help you out, but if you want to vent, or dig a bit deeper, don't hesitate to message me."

In my experience and in what I've had and felt like I've missed out on, I know that everyone is lonely at least sometimes, even when they have everything. I've been going through a rough patch the last year or so and I can say that even when I had everything I needed, I was still lonely. My best friend at the time wasn't enough, and that wasn't her fault. It was mine because I didn't treasure what I had when I had it and now I look back and realize I had everything. So you see, it's only a matter of perception. One day you will have everything you need, I can promise you that. But it won't be because you have everything you REALLY need, it will be because you'll remember where you were once, and how you wish you had at least something. And you'll treasure what is it you have. So hang on. Be lonely and learn about yourself because it'll help you when you find something worthwhile. I hope you can find company in yourself for now. And when someone comes into your life, you'll feel it. You'll no longer be alone and you'll be able to contrast then to now. And it'll be beautiful."
lonely,3cbnnl,lostatthehelm,2,Mon Jul 6 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"From a male perspective, and depending on your age, which would have been helpful to know in this case, and whether or not you frequently use Pornography, it might just be lust. Men have this drive towards women, it's subsequently reinforced via Porn, and masturbation, this fantasy, this POV life if you will, causing you to feel this lust. Now the brain, tricks you into thinking this is actual love or companionship that you seek, when you seek ass, (figuratively of course.) This was a crush, and though it might be wise to talk to her the next time, it also might not be, since you've spend the duration of an entire sermon fantasizing about her, about her personality, about her looks, about who she is from just a glance, and trust me looks are very deceiving, and the most short lived thing in a relationship, as I like to say, you need to think about post-orgasm to understand how you feel about someone. But this is our biological framework, and you couldn't help to be attracted, and you did nothing wrong, just don't get the idea that they intense feelings are a perpetual part of relationship, because they really aren't.   Now to take the edge off, don't be offended, but just ""shake the creamer"", and you'll realized how real your feelings towards her were. Nature is cruel, dude but you gotta outsmart it! Of course you could talk about it with your above mentioned friends, they wouldn't be take surprised but I feel like they would give the same advice.

I don't know how to give people an ""out"" or easy way to say no if they're not interested, and I would absolutely hate it if someone said yes to be polite only to cancel, then cancel a reschedule etc. I remember when we were kids, my sister would walk right up to someone and go ""will you be my friend?""

Confront him about the relationship and that you think it's going downhill maybe suggest counseling? If he says ""nothin's wrong hun it's all in your head,"" then you need to move on immediately. If he tries to work things out then great! Give yourself a time line, a date that you want to look back and assess the progress of the relationship. Your time on earth is short, don't waste it on someone who won't reciprocate the love you feel for them.

They won't usually and also most people are self-interested at first glance, you are probably expecting more than normal casual acquaintances leading to friends will naturally offer.   What everyone wants is to be heard and understood, if you give people that (instead of being preoccupied with them wanting to give that to you) then you'll have the most important thing to offer anyone-- that people actually really crave. You'll become more likeable, and actually if you get it down, people will seek you out because you make them feel loved and accepted.  I find that most people are kind of selfish initially and eb and flow through that selfishness even in the most loving relationships. When you want someone to love you a certain way, just stop. Love yourself that way, and try to love others the way you think they would want also. To me it seems the less you need people (and are whole in yourself, confident, attentive to them and positive), the more people seem to want to be around."

Life is long, long enough for things to get better, I've been depressed, and I know many other people who have been depressed, who have been able to overcome their fears and anxieties. Feeling lonely is natural, everyone feels lonely at some point, you just have to keep looking for something that makes you happy. It's also important to know that there are many, many other people who feel just as lonely as you, so take comfort in knowing that you are not alone."

I offer these three responses to you: 1) The world can be cruel at times, but it is also a beautiful place and there are people who don't even know you that want to help you see that beauty (That includes me). 2) Remember, there was a time we all sucked at everything we did. It was when we were babies and we didn't know how to eat solid food or roll over. Now we've grown a little, become excellent at some tasks, and still have a few more things we suck at. Just keep practicing those skills and hobbies until you have mastered them. Its a great way to distract ourselves from preying upon our insecurities. 3) Everything changes. We are changing each and every second, mainly at a biological or molecular level, but we are changing. Cultures and countries are changing, too. Sometimes change happens randomly, and other times we have to do it ourselves. Whether that random event helps you or you help you, things will get better and I hope they do :)"

She broke up with me over the phone while I was out of state for my first semester in college, an already stressful time. It triggered my depression, and for almost a year, I tried to be best friends with her and she tried to help me through my new found depression. Until she decided enough was enough and started talking shit about me with my ex best friend/brother (whom are now dating each other)   You don't want to hear it now. You don't want to believe it now. But close contact. I think back on the year I tried to mend things. It's the most cringe worthy part of my life (currently a junior in college). Life will be better if you close contact and pick up a hobby, preferably something to stay or get in shape. But loneliness isn't solved easy. I'm here on the sub reddit hoping to find something to help me with my still loneliness. I have friends. I'm not alone. But I'm lonely again, maybe from lack of a relationship in so long. I've only ever had one and it was honestly fantastic. But I read your post and felt like giving my 2 cents since I was in an identical situation 2 years ago. Just trying to save you some heartache and cringe memories if I can help it.   Cheers, have a blessed day brother."
lonely,3c4bl5,CylonSloth,2,Sat Jul 4 23:39:18 2015 UTC,"Ugg so hard.   First of all, you were in a weird place before it sounds like, and finding her probably didn't fix it, it just covered it up for awhile. Kinda like how I smoke pot when I get stressed out and none of the things I'm stressing on get done then I sober up and still have to clean my house and stuff (or go on this sub reddit cause its a holiday and I'm bored, le sigh)  Anyway, you need friends man. And it sounds like you maybe smothered her and got a bit paranoid possibly or posessive. Or you were just being yourself and the relationship hit a point where you learned you each value different things so much you maybe are not that compatable.   Don't blame her, and also don't credit her for ""curing"" your lonliness before. Its good you had an experience. Breakups are always hard. But theres hope, you can move on, and learn from it and be happy for the times you had.   The more you stop being her friend and invest in real platonic friendships I suspect the faster you will heal.   Now... to sober up and clean my kitchen"

Time is most important, considering it has been 3 years since I had a mutual break up with someone and I'm still recovering.

lonely,3c3288,believethepretender,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:58:37 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it helps to ""clear the emotional air"" and release it in a voodoo/self-hypnotising sort of way. Things like writing a letter to her and burning it, or imagining saying those last things you wish you could have said and having them really be understood (and vis versa), or even imagining both of you being happy for one another marrying someone else one day as friends, are strategies that have helped me in certain contexts.   I've found that the ones I had the hardest times ""letting go of"" often were the ones who treated me the worst. Relationships that ended on good terms often felt fine, and often times could stay good friends, whereas emotionally abusive, long-term struggles often kept this sick feeling that lingered for months or years after.   I sometimes would end up apologizing to myself, for letting myself be with someone who didn't respect me/had such unhealthy chemistry for such a long time, and really acknowledge that I was worthy of better love than that. The second I admitted things like this, it often felt like I could really move on. Loving yourself and the other person without expectation, in a forgiving way, personally helped me."

lonely,3bvbd6,rustypete89,2,Thu Jul 2 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"You may not want to hear this, but it may have been a blessing in disguise that this happened before you got the chance to propose. She would have exhibited the same behavior in your married life, I suspect. Regardless, I would suggest seeking out a support group of some kind. You will need a sense of community to help you through the remaining weeks. And keep yourself busy. Invest in your hobbies, or try to pick up some new ones. Try not to leave yourself alone with your thoughts if you can - And if you're having trouble sleeping, consider a benign, natural sleep aid like melatonin before resorting to anything else.  What are your plans once you've returned home?"
lonely,3bvbd6,rustypete89,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:31:40 2015 UTC,I don't know. I had everything planned out and it's all fallen apart
lonely,3bvbd6,Tired-Swine,2,Thu Jul 2 14:37:54 2015 UTC,"So make a new plan! You have the benefit of about 40 days in which to figure out what you are going to do next. I hope you won't hold back. This could be the perfect time to do something you've always wanted to do - move to a new city, travel and visit a place you've always wanted to see, learn something you've always wanted to try - whatever it is, now could be your best chance to do it! And you deserve it, treat yourself. When you leave your current city, I hope you hit the ground running :)"

lonely,3bujj6,LonelyGuy6,5,Thu Jul 2 07:07:13 2015 UTC,Keep your chin up. I feel you.. I'm right there with you. I'll be the same way on the 4th for the U.S
lonely,3bujj6,VersaGrotto,2,Thu Jul 2 07:33:04 2015 UTC,"Tell me about it. It sucks. I can't go downtown anymore. So many people, every single one of them taken.   I am eternally alone. I try striking up conversations with the bar tenders, with other patrons at the bar - but either I'm ignored to the point where I can't even order a drink, or people move away from me.  I'd kill to have someone text me unprovoked. I'd love if someone asked me to hang out. Anything.   I'm almost looking forward to my birthday - and the only text I'll get will be from my brother. If it weren't for my family, this loneliness would have ended me months ago. It may end me yet."
lonely,3bujj6,WorkplaceWatcher,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:19:56 2015 UTC,"Why didn't you strike up a convo with the barista? I know for some types it's hard, but it can lead to something if given the chance."

lonely,3bujj6,Phil567,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:34:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like this sometimes. I think its mostly cause I feel like an outcast.  I like to talk about things that are actually happening in the world. I care about things that are happening and i keep it real, and that pushes a lot of people away from me because I'm not focusing on what Kim and Kanye are wearing or in a rush to go buy something everyone else is wearing and to add on I'm extremely shy and so that doesn't help my case either.  Anyways the point of my post is that I'm here for you don't feel alone because I feel somewhat the same. obviously I can't feel the same exact thing because were in different bodies haha (trying to lighten the mood).  Inbox me we can talk :). Btw I watched the fireworks from my parents window for like two minutes and then i got sad because i had no one to share my excitement with."
lonely,3bujj6,overandundertbwg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:55:58 2015 UTC,It's 25-30 degrees c here and we are all complaining it's too hot haha
lonely,3bujj6,InkMePretty,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:35:52 2015 UTC,"I relate 100%. Didn't even go to Canada Day fireworks this year because it would just trigger the loneliness and unhappiness I feel so much of the time. I stay off social media because it does the same. Everyone seems so happy with their abundance of friends and significant others' and you kinda sit here like...why don't I have that too? What did I do wrong? Idk. It sucks so fucking much. But if you need someone to talk to, I'm here. You can message me :)"

lonely,3btneo,Jweller9,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:32:09 2015 UTC,Have you spent time exploring the area you're in? What have you done to try to meet people and make friends? Is it a large urban center or more rural and secluded?
lonely,3btneo,rustypete89,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:19:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, think of it this way: you've made it more than halfway through and you know for a fact that there will be a time when you are reunited with your family and friends soon. I've recently done something similar but I'm here for much more than a summer (try 2 yrs min) and one thing that helps me is realizing that you are doing something most people wouldn't be capable of. Or at least I like to think it helps anyways. But do you have roommates? Are there after-work activities? If you're in an area with lots of parks and such, try hiking. No matter what happens, you can get through this!"
lonely,3btneo,midwestnewbie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"I know I'm excited that I'm halfway done! Another five weeks and I'm done for good. I've attempted to find things to keep me busy but I've kinda failed. I'm a person that loves to plan activities and events, but typically with other people. There is plenty of stuff to do where I'm at but I hate doing it alone. I keep saying I'm going to go to church to attempt to meet people, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet. The weekends are the hard part, I try to plan them out so I'm not sitting in my room watching Netflix all day. I only have 4 weekends left and my parents visit me in two weeks. So essentially 3 weekends of unplanned stuff. Some people would love that! Me....not so much."
lonely,3bsgvs,this_throwawayofmine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:55:59 2015 UTC,"Hey man, you're fighting a tough battle. Congratulations on making it this far! I don't know EXACTLY what your pain feels like, but I've been abandoned by my mother, so I have s good idea of what you might be feeling right now.   Firstly, I want to make sure you have someone to talk to for whatever's on your mind. I'll PM you my phone number. You can call or text me 24/7 if something is plaguing your thoughts, ok?  Second, you can't blame yourself for what your ex chose to do. I imagine you've been running through the entire two years you've been together, looking for ways you could have said or did something different to save the relationship. Well, relationships are a two way street, and unfortunately your ex chose to sabotage the relationship. There's nothing you could have done or can do now. So why blame yourself and carry her burden of guilt?  Thirdly, you need to forgive her for what she's done and refuse to harbor bitterness in your heart. Bitterness can destroy your life. If you let it, that is. Forgiveness cures bitterness. Forgiveness is not approval of another's actions, and it's not surrendering. It's simply saying, ""what you did was wrong, and it hurt me, but I won't hold onto that offense. I release it, and I wish you well."" You don't need to continue the relationship to forgive someone, and they don't even need to accept it. Forgiveness is a personal act that frees you from bitterness.   Fourthly, I'm reading between the lines here, but it seems you might be holding onto some guilt regarding what you've done with your ex sexually. I urge you to ask forgiveness from God, ask that He will remove your sin and cleanse you from all unrighteousness, then believe He will do so. Remember, there is no condemnation from God (Romans 8).   I hope this helps. I'm so sorry that you're hurting so much. Hang in there, and please reach out to someone like you did here if you need help."
lonely,3bsgvs,CaptainNerdy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:19:59 2015 UTC,"I can't say I know exactly what you're going through. Nobody can. But I can relate. My ex fiance broke up with me a few months ago after over five years. The first couple months are like hell. But I promise you It gets better. If you need someone to talk to pm me. We can get through it together, friend."
lonely,3bsgvs,joko91,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:15:37 2015 UTC,"I just can't stop thinking of her with him. He knew we were in a relationship. She lived with him at the beginning of our time together and swore she never did anything with him. I believed her. She finally told me after everything else came out that she was fucking him. I feel so angry and sad. If I didn't have a job to go to/keep up appearances I would spend my days drunk and crying. She was the love of my life and threw it all away. I keep imagining her blowing him. His hands all over her body, a body I spent 2 years practically worshipping. I told her often that she was sexy and that I loved her, then this guy says he wants to kill himself and she becomes putty in his hands. How did you get through this? I've talked to friends and family but they don't understand. I feel like texting her, I know I shouldn't, but I want her to know the hell I'm going through. It's like one of my favorite poets said, ""I [want to] destroy everything [she] holds dear, by simply destroying everything, far and near."" I'm sorry for going on so long. It's been a rough day...."
lonely,3bs6t8,sharpyz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:44:32 2015 UTC,"You and me both. I guess the good news for you is that if you had a relationship at one point, you can have another. You've proven yourself capable of maintaining a relationship."
lonely,3bs6t8,anon34576,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:56:48 2015 UTC,"thank you.. I didn't look at that I guess.. it truly is a shitty feeling hope you can be strong as well and find your self again. I am just working out, cutting weight, guess I need to go to r/seduction haha"
lonely,3bs6t8,anon34576,0,Wed Jul 1 23:04:41 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm lost my friend, totally lost. Working out is awesome. I recommend cardio, doing over 20 minutes of jogging really lifts your mood. I do mostly weights training, but I find after a run I often feel better."
lonely,3bs6t8,WorkplaceWatcher,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"Be careful. If you set unrealistic goals you'll end up like me and leaving the gym completely and utterly defeated.  No matter how minimum my goal, I always seem to fail it. I end leaving the gym feeling sick, exhausted, winded - and completely defeated. I feel so utterly worthless.  I do sometimes wonder why I go to the gym. I don't have anyone to get into shape for. People say ""do it for yourself"" ... I don't care about myself."
lonely,3bs6t8,anon34576,0,Thu Jul 2 12:02:10 2015 UTC,"I never really set goals, in that sense. I just said to myself: ""I will work out 5 times a week"", and then stuck to that. I didn't say I want to bench X amount in Y amount of time, etc, I just chose a workout program and stuck to it."
lonely,3bs6t8,WorkplaceWatcher,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:40:40 2015 UTC,I just chose a workout program and stuck to it.   So what you're saying is you set a goal. And achieved it.
lonely,3bs6t8,anon34576,0,Thu Jul 2 15:43:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, I set goals in terms of how often I want to work out. Once I got ""fit"" I also set more complex goals, like running for a certain distance, or lifting a certain amount of weight, but my point was not to set ""unrealistic"" goals in the beginning, like bench pressing 100 kilos when you've never lifted before, or running 10k when you've never gone jogging. Start by just establishing a workout schedule, don't worry about how much you're lifting or how far you're running."
lonely,3bs6t8,WorkplaceWatcher,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:47:19 2015 UTC,"So pretty much precisely what I said. I try to do realistic goals (""going to work out 3x this week!"" ""Going to walk/run three miles!"") and I fail. Either family life, or my body just doesn't want to cooperate."
lonely,3bs6t8,anon34576,0,Thu Jul 2 15:48:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe your goals are too difficult to achieve, you're too busy, or something? Have your tried splitting your workouts? I sometimes do this. Instead of running for an hour, or working out for an hour, I'll do two half hour sessions. It feels easier, since you are ""only doing 30 mins""."
lonely,3bs6t8,WorkplaceWatcher,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:47:17 2015 UTC,LOL. When? When would I have the time for that? No. No way I could hit the gym twice a day. Or double up the number of times I go.
lonely,3bo4n1,okko7,3,Tue Jun 30 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, I mostly lurk myself, and I run into the same issue. I think it might be nice to be able to talk to people locally in the same area, if they'd be open to that. I think reddit flair would work, if there's flair we could type in on our own. You could put your country, state, closest major city, etc.  I always thought it would be nice to have some other way of communicating outside of this subreddit, but I don't know what would be suitable.  On a side note, I think the anonymity here is part of what makes people comfortable saying what they really feel. Maybe talking to another redditor from this subreddit could be an exception, but maybe not. I also know that it takes a lot to be as vulnerable as people are here when it comes to loneliness. I think being able to talk with someone IRL would help immensely, but only if someone is ok with crossing that barrier. I guess putting up a flair with a general location is enough of an indication, lol. I dunno."
lonely,3bo4n1,thelightisdim,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:03:10 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you're saying =) An optional flair with your location seems like a perfect solution to it all
lonely,3bo4n1,truthfullyme,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:12:05 2015 UTC,"An optional flair sounds like a good thing.   As for the anonymity: As there are very little chances the people actually know each others, even if they meet, they can preserve their anonymity.   Maybe we can just give it a try?"
lonely,3bo4n1,rustypete89,3,Wed Jul 1 21:24:59 2015 UTC,"There was a user a while back who came to this subreddit and posted video blogs - talking about his own problems and answering questions from other users. It was really inspirational stuff. As it happens, earlier today I was watching a video recorded by Wil Wheaton for Project UROK (""you are ok"") and he did a similar thing. Described his own struggles and voiced support for people currently suffering. I poked around their website a bit and the whole thing was in that same vein. I wonder if this community would be open to the idea of partnering with UROK - they basically have the same goal. At the very least, I think we could broaden the submission guidelines to include more access to resources for support and the like. Turn the community into a hub for lonely people to not only vent, but actively seek help and healing! Sounds pretty rad to me 8)"
