MachinePorn,3e0ew6,thelightshow,53,Tue Jul 21 00:13:57 2015 UTC,"This fact list is older than dirt, but I think most of it still applies.   One dragster's 500-inch Hemi makes more horsepower then the first 8 rows at Daytona. Under full throttle, a dragster engine consumes 1 1/2 gallons of nitro per second, the same rate of fuel consumption as a fully loaded 747 but with 4 times the energy volume. The supercharger takes more power to drive than a stock hemi makes. Even with nearly 3000 CFM of air being rammed in by the supercharger on overdrive, the fuel mixture is compressed into nearly-solid form before ignition. Cylinders run on the verge of hydraulic lock. Dual magnetos apply 44 amps to each spark plug. This is the output of an arc welder in each cylinder. At stoichiometric (exact) 1.7:1 air/fuel mixture (for nitro), the flame front of nitromethane measures 7050 degrees F. Nitromethane burns yellow. The spectacular white flame seen above the stacks at night is raw burning hydrogen, dissociated from atmospheric water vapor by the searing exhaust gases. Spark plug electrodes are totally consumed during a pass. After 1/2 way, the engine is dieseling from compression-plus the glow of exhaust valves at 1400 degrees F. The engine can only be shut down by cutting off its fuel flow. If spark momentarily fails early in the run, unburned nitro builds up in those cylinders and then explodes with a force that can blow cylinder heads off the block in pieces or blow the block in half. Dragsters twist the crank (torsionally) so far (20 degrees in the big end of the track) that sometimes cam lobes are ground offset from front to rear to re-phase the valve timing somewhere closer to synchronization with the pistons. To exceed 300mph in 4.5 seconds dragsters must accelerate at an average of over 4G's. But in reaching 200 mph well before 1/2 track, launch acceleration is closer to 8G's. If all the equipment is paid off, the crew worked for free, and for once NOTHING BLOWS UP, each run costs $1000.00 per second. Dragsters reach over 300 miles per hour before you have read this sentence. Did you know that the nitromethane-powered engines of NHRA Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars produce approximately 7,000 horsepower, about 37 times that of the average street car? that one cylinder of the eight cylinders of a Top Fuel dragster or a Funny Car produces 750 horsepower, equaling the entire horsepower output of a NASCAR engine? that the gasoline-powered engines of NHRA Pro Stock cars produce about 1,200 horsepower, about eight times that of the average street car? that an NHRA Top Fuel dragster accelerates from 0 to 100 mph in less than .8-second, almost 11 seconds quicker than it takes a production Porsche 911 Turbo to reach the same speed? that an NHRA Top Fuel dragster leaves the starting line with a force nearly five times that of gravity, the same force of the space shuttle when it leaves the launching pad at Cape Canaveral? that an NHRA Funny Car is slowed by a reverse force more than seven times that of gravity when both parachutes deploy simultaneously? that NHRA Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars consume between four and five gallons of fuel during a quarter-mile run, which is equivalent to between 16 and 20 gallons per mile? that NHRA Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars use between 10 and 12 gallons of fuel for a complete pass, including the burnout, backup to the starting line, and quarter-mile run? that NHRA Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars travel the length of more than four football fields in less than five seconds? that NHRA Top Fuel dragsters can exceed 280 mph in just 660 feet? that from a standing start, NHRA Top Fuel dragsters accelerate faster than a jumbo jet, a fighter jet, and a Formula One race car? that a fuel pump for an NHRA Top Fuel dragster and Funny Car delivers 65 gallons of fuel per minute, equivalent to eight bathroom showers running at the same time? that the fuel-line pressure for NHRA Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars is between 400 and 500 pounds, about 20 times greater than the pressure on passenger-car fuel pumps? that depending on size and angle, the large rear wing on an NHRA Top Fuel dragster develops between 4,000 and 8,000 pounds of downforce? that the 17-inch rear tires used on NHRA Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars wear out after four to six runs, or about two miles? Some brands of passenger-car tires are guaranteed for 80,000 miles. that it takes just 15/100ths of a second for all 7,000 horsepower of an NHRA Top Fuel dragster engine to reach the rear wheels? that it's desirable for an NHRA Top Fuel dragster to race with its front wheels inches off the ground for about the first 200 feet of the run? This ensures proper weight transfer to the rear wheels, a crucial part of a good launch and quick run. that the nitromethane used to power the engines of NHRA Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars costs about $30 per gallon?"

MachinePorn,3e0ew6,Gr3yGhost,4,Tue Jul 21 14:29:13 2015 UTC,Maybe the heat the engines produce? Perhaps having a COP sitting down in the head would melt. It might also be a regulation across the class. Sorry I'm not too familiar either.
MachinePorn,3e0ew6,Mike312,4,Tue Jul 21 02:56:17 2015 UTC,I'd imagine for the higher current available to the plugs; each one is capable of 44 amps if I recall. I wouldn't think coil on plug wouldn't provide a strong enough spark for a good burn.
MachinePorn,3e0ew6,AnalInferno,6,Tue Jul 21 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"These cars dont use a powerful enough battery (small, only used for the ECU and gauge cluster) and don't use an alternator.   The engines use an external starter to start the engine and the engines own rotation provided the massive power of the magnetos.   There isn't a COP system that produces as much power as an arc-welder that is small enough to fit in a spark plug well or would there be enough room to mount the things on the valve covers.  Its more complex than a traditional distributor/magneto setup"
MachinePorn,3e0ew6,calfan5,3,Tue Jul 21 04:11:02 2015 UTC,"Now you've got me wondering. Spent the last few minutes trying to figure out why a distributor would be better, and all I can do is agree with /u/derb that is probably some class regulation. IIRC, they also still use pushrods instead of overhead cams and a couple other anachronistic technologies that aren't suited for production automobiles, but which probably work well in the pressures and stresses used in this environment."
MachinePorn,3e0ew6,Dionysus19,3,Tue Jul 21 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"There are benefits to these 'anachronistic' technologies. Just because another technology exists, does not make it better in all situations. Pushrod engines are still smaller and lighter and can push 10,000 rpm with ease. Only very small engines get the full benefits of OHC. These ""distributors"" are actually magnetos, they are self powered and dead reliable."

MachinePorn,3du62a,Eblumen,24,Sun Jul 19 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"According to this article, the largest ships use about 380 tons of fuel per day. So in the grand scheme it may not be a lot, but gasoline weighs about 6 pounds per gallon making 800 tons around 266,000 gallons of fuel saved."

MachinePorn,3du62a,249ba36000029bbe9749,2,Sun Jul 19 20:59:53 2015 UTC,"Apart from just the fuel savings, it could be that they can get more vehicles packed in more efficiently with that hull shape. When you are hauling oil your cargo can fit in any shape you form. Even cargo containers can pretty much go anywhere they can fit. But cars on a RORO have to be able to be driven on and parked so having that bulbous front could make that job easier."

MachinePorn,3drv25,MrBlandEST,4,Sun Jul 19 03:47:34 2015 UTC,It's all gears in multiple gear boxes driven by a drive shaft from the back of the engine that runs constantly. The levers control sliding engagement dogs that then run various other gear boxes and shafts. If the operator overloads the system a lever can snap out of engagement with great force. Never lock your elbow! We have a 1960 model that still works occasionally. Actually very complex and the Cats live a long time but very expensive to fix.

The huge majority of designs avoided it completely, preferring instead to rely on integrated mechanical superchargers. Compare the complexity of the P47 to the comparatively simple F4 Corsair or the hilariously basic F6F Hellcat, both powered by the same R2800 radial engine.  As an aside, the Hellcat was one of the most successful fighters of the war. The Mustang and the Spitfire get all the attention in the popular imagination but the Essex class fleet carriers and their Hellcats were in a league of their own. They annihilated the IJN.

This chart shows the P-47 turbo peaking at 18 250 RPM.

MachinePorn,3dmlmi,jonjt,11,Fri Jul 17 19:55:32 2015 UTC,"Part of the difference is in useful RPM; your car doesn't need to keep the tips of a 10-foot-plus prop subsonic. The big radials are geared, but there are limitations on how far that can be taken without getting crazy in terms of weight or reliability. ""There's no replacement for displacement"" still largely holds true in piston aviation; not much has changed since 1945. (No doubt in part because FAA regulations make even simple developments extremely expensive, but even in the experimental aircraft world it's REALLY hard to beat an old Lycoming or Continental for most practical uses.)"
MachinePorn,3dmlmi,thunder_wonderdog,5,Fri Jul 17 23:08:03 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. That said, its possible to do way better than .71hp/in3 with forced induction, today. However, if the FAA is the issue then there is no hope."
MachinePorn,3dmlmi,jonjt,2,Sat Jul 18 00:21:50 2015 UTC,"At usable RPMs? I really have no idea, but I do know that, 1) no modern production piston aircraft engine gets much over .5, and 2) it's not like we WANT to drag big, heavy, underpowered engines through the sky."
MachinePorn,3dmlmi,thunder_wonderdog,2,Sat Jul 18 00:58:29 2015 UTC,"Well, i dont know what rpms modern airplane engines operate at when cruising but i do know some car engines have been adapted for aeroplane use, and they maintain their specific output.   In any case, low specific output wasn't limited to airplane engines of the day. Look at the v8 engines used in tracked armor.  The specific out put was terrible, in comparison to engines of today.   Furthermore, you can achieve great specific output at relatively low rpms. My car sees about 70% of peak output by 3krpms. That speed not out of the question for a radial engine, at wide open throttle. Considering my car gets about 2hp per cubic liter at peak output, it's nearly at twice the specific performance of those radials, at an aeroplane friendly 3k rpms.   If aeroplane piston engines of today are underperforming, i doubt its because of technological limits. There isn't a reason why aeroplane engines cant have higher specific out, with turbocharging.  Boat engines are a good example of this fact. They can turn 3k rpms at high specific output, all day."
MachinePorn,3dmlmi,humjaba,7,Sat Jul 18 01:46:22 2015 UTC,"Most redline somewhere around 2700. Long (seaplane) props are right on the edge of supersonic and loud as hell there, but still 3K isn't a bad number to play with.  The auto adaptions I'm (vaguely) familiar with run belt reduction (off Ford V6s - ~200HP@230CI) and have serious reliability and/or weight issues. If you've got enough airplane to drag around an ""aircraft quality"" gear reduction device (and water cooling) on the front of a car engine, you've probably also got enough airplane to drag around a reasonable amount of JP8 and turbines start to make sense. (Auto engines also have longevity issues which quickly negate cost - most car engines are designed to putt around at ~30% power or something, aircraft generally live between 75 and 100%.)  The E-Tec 150 outboard claims ~100HP/145CI at 3000 RPM, Honda 150 claims about 80. (If you mean big boat engines, a ~500CI diesel will make ~300HP. If you mean BIG boat engines, Wiki says  says ~100KHP on 100KCI - at 102RPM - impressive....)  Both 150 outboards weigh about double a 150HP aircraft engine.  Would you mind posting displacement and a HP curve for your car? This is fascinating - I really though that things like outboards would have changed more than they apparently have."

That's a LOT of weight way out on the nose, and that's what REALLY matters. I've been thinking of HP/CI as a proxy for weight, and I don't think it's working very well."
MachinePorn,3dmlmi,irritatingrobot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:11:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info on typical engine RPMs.    I'm not familiar with the Ford V6s but, I have some knowledge of adapted LS V8s.  I haven't heard of any reliability issues but then again, I don't fly in prop planes.    When I said boat engines, I meant more so high displacement V8 engines, with forced induction.  I typically seem them used for higher performance boats.  I wasn't talking about outboards.    I don't have HP curves for my car specifically but, you can find curves all over the internet.  I have a 09' 335i.  It has an N54, with a COBB tune.  Here is a link with some info:    https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCwQFjABahUKEwi13Kzi-eXGAhXK1YAKHbxSDVc&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.cobbtuning.com%2Fcobbtuningweb%2Fsite%2Fmaps%2Fbmw%2FMap_Notes%2FMap%2520Notes%2520for%2520BMW%2520N54%2520Accessport.pdf&amp;ei=B_GqVfW8CMqrgwS8pbW4BQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFaUZHkjBUd5-dU-pGx9Ql484KcLA&amp;bvm=bv.98197061,d.eXY    The general trend in automotive engine design these days is to use forced induction to achieve ridiculous specific output numbers.  In so doing, manufacturers can meet the MPG requirements that various governments enforce, while still achieving the power requirements buyers expect.  The N54, in particular, is a fantastic example.  The engine is tuned to deliver a large percentage of it's power between 3k and 6k RPMS, after which point it falls flat on it's face.    However, the amazing thing about this engine is the amount of stress the block and the internals can withstand.  The STOCK rotating assembly has been proven reliable at power levels that are about 2.5times higher than stock.    I know of one guy in Germany who increased output by about 130HP and decided to turn his car into a track toy.  He ended up seizing his main journal bearings but, had 0 issues with the rest of the rotating assembly, or the valvetrain.  I was quite impressed."
MachinePorn,3dmlmi,essenceofreddit,3,Sun Jul 19 00:39:36 2015 UTC,You also can't just scale up a 2 liter car engine by a factor of 20 and expect everything to still work.

MachinePorn,3dmlmi,jonjt,4,Fri Jul 17 21:03:05 2015 UTC,"So does a turboed aircraft at 20,000 feet - as far as the engine knows...."
MachinePorn,3dmlmi,irritatingrobot,5,Fri Jul 17 23:09:02 2015 UTC,"So, assuming that the turbocharger can deliver the correct mass flow at the pressure ratio it encounters at altitude, the fact that the air is less dense makes no difference.   If the engineers did their job, then it wont matter.   Since the engine has to deliver the ~2000 HP during flight, the turbo will encounter a lower pressure ratio IF it goes into boost, at sea level.  Since the higher density will cause the impeller to spin at a slower rate, for a given mass flow across the lower pressure ratio, the turbo will spin slower and reach boost faster than it would at altitude.    The net effect is that the power is the same but, it would reach it later than it would at sea level.  Edit: this is all assuming that the impeller doesnt stall, of course.  This is why forced induction, specifically via centrifugal pumping, was really advantageous for airplanes that were powered by piston engines.  Their power output was independent of air pressure (altitude) within a certain range.  My car is also turbocharged and the Engine Control Module can perform the same function: keep engine power output constant despite varying air density and temperature, so long as the operating conditions dont get too extreme."
MachinePorn,3dmlmi,jonjt,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:36 2015 UTC,"There are 125cc motorcycles that are over 3hp/ci without a turbocharger. The rotating mass in an engine like that is tiny so all of the internals can be built fairly lightly and still rev sky high without the engine blowing up.  A 40 liter aircraft engine is going to have the same thing going on In the other direction, it's honestly pretty incredible that they managed an hp/liter figure that would be ""not bad"" for a V8 automobile engine."

Specific output of about .5hp/ci.      Using something larger, you could look at the Chrysler Multitask, used in the latest iteration of the Sherman.    470hp from a ~20l engine at about 2500rpms.  That's about .380hp/CI.        The aircraft engine was better than both at ~.70hp/CI, because of the turbocharging.  At 2500rpms and 4000rpms respectively, my car is at about 1.23hp/ci and 1.53hp/ci.    The idea is that technology has improved quite a bit and engines can sustain higher output levels, at the same engine speed.    Expanding focus to include motor cycle engines, you can see that motorcycle engines, like the one you quoted, can achieve higher levels of power output because of improvements in technology that allow for higher rotating speeds than they could manage with 1940s metallurgy.      Two ways to skin this horse, higher average cylinder pressures at a given RPM (that's what I'm talking about) and higher mean piston speeds (What you are talking about).  Both resulted from improvements in technology, which was my point."

So the sway bars go from the hinge point up to the long see-saw at the back of the car.  Is the see-saw able to move forward and back itself?  Otherwise, it seems like if one suspension was compressed, the other would be expanded by the sway-bars and see-saw.  Seems like they act counter to each other.  If that's the case, what happens when the car hits a bump where both wheels want to rebound simultaneously...?"

MachinePorn,3dec64,saintNIC,3,Thu Jul 16 05:21:50 2015 UTC,"So if you take a spring and try to form it like this, it won't keep its shape.  It, well, ""springs"" back.  Is the spring formed here in a different state of some kind?  Is it really hot?  Or maybe it's soft wire, and heat-treated later?"
MachinePorn,3dec64,markrages,7,Wed Jul 15 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"Any ductile material (e.g. steel) will ""keep its shape"" if it is deformed enough and in the right way (with small exceptions for things like shape change alloys). While its possible the springs will be heat treated at some point after forming. It is likely that the forming process would be done cold. An additional benefit of cold forming is that the material will actually get slightly stiffer after it has been formed."
MachinePorn,3dec64,ItsJamesWithAnO,2,Wed Jul 15 19:57:29 2015 UTC,that's one of the mysteries of my life.
MachinePorn,3dec64,Blackers,4,Wed Jul 15 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"Materials elastic and plastic deformations. You know how if you pull a spring a bit it goes back to the same shape but if you pull it really hard you permanently stretch it out and ruin it. The same thing happens on the atomic lattice scale, when the force is enough the lattice shears and deforms permanently. Forming a spring this way can be done cold because when they deform the material in a circular motion they are pushing it well into the plastic region where the deformation is permanent."
MachinePorn,3dec64,omegashadow,2,Wed Jul 15 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"plastic deformation is permanent with a ""spring back coefficient"" that is of course relatively high for spring material.  What you don't see is that in order to do that right angle bend it's probably bending much further past 90 degrees or imparting some other plastic deformation in order for it to end up at 90 degrees.    Even something really ductile like aluminum still has spring back when doing cold forming operations."

MachinePorn,3deb1k,ScottSEA,9,Thu Jul 16 00:09:30 2015 UTC,"Rather than having a ship drop anchor to stay in a position, a mooring buoy can be put in.  It will have four or six anchor clumps making it a very secure proposition - very resistant to dragging off position in high winds or seas.  This would be important that close to a reef.  Ship would come up, connect its chain to the shackle on the buoy and be snug as a bug.  It would have the added benefit of reducing the impact on the sea bottom of multiple anchor drops.  Also important this close to a reef.  I have also seen these set up to make a four-point mooring for a salvage ship, albeit a much smaller one than the one seen here.  So, this could have been part of an earlier salvage effort to drag the sweeper off the reef.  So, in this particular case, not completely sure, but what I've outlined seems plausible."

They have an impressively high reach.  I'm guessing Ponta Delgada is a relatively small port with no competition. Most cargo ships would be small coastal freighters loaded and unloaded with basic cargo cranes and old-fashioned longshoreman labor. These high reach / multiple cranes are so they can also rapidly turn around big expensive container ships using ISO container lift spreaders.

The original 747-100 was made in the 1970s and had a short second deck. The -200 was created about five years later. The -300 further extended the second deck. The -400 was essentially a remake of the -300, but it was the standard for many many years until the -8 was made.  Just a small note, the -8 should really be called a 747-500, but they launched it with the 787 and wanted to have a marketing deal to go with it..."

MachinePorn,3d1fuq,TheJBW,22,Mon Jul 13 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"It is much smaller. Boeing bet on the ""point to point"" system, being the way of the future -- that is, more direct flights between smaller regional airports, as opposed to Airbus' bet on the traditional ""hub and spoke"" system, where most long haul flights pass through JFK / Heathrow / Tokyo (I think?). The 787 is a smaller but very efficient and more comfortable plane. For a while it looked like Boeing had made the right bet, but I'm not 100% sure if that's an accurate picture in terms of plane sales today."
MachinePorn,3d1fuq,catsfive,10,Mon Jul 13 02:20:04 2015 UTC,"I think both are working. To me, the 787 gives the larger, more global airlines the ability to actively move these aircraft around to capitalize on seasonal movements."

Rumours of blueprints being pilfered were rife, to the point that the British and French security/intelligence started leaking deliberately incorrect ones, which the Soviets apparently gobbled up, even having the gall to approach the Western governments for help when they couldn't figure certain bits out.  The cooling system required for the fuselage of the aircraft at supersonic speeds was so noisy that you had to shout to be heard by the passenger next to you, and it was impossible to talk to someone further away, even when screaming at the top of your lungs.  The thing had so many issues that the designer, Alexei Tupolev, had to be personally present at the airport to sign it off each time it flew.  However, it did was it was required to do - it allowed the Soviets to start a supersonic passenger service before the West did, and during the Cold War, that's all that mattered."

The main problem they had with flying wings is bad stall characteristics that tend to lead toward a death spiral, as was the case with the one Northrop YB-49 crash. The Horten 229 crash was due to the unreliable BMW jet engines of the time though more than the airframe design."
MachinePorn,3csfaq,sverdrupian,3,Fri Jul 10 16:44:03 2015 UTC,That's a good point. If an RC flying wing works than it must be possible with proper design to create an aircraft with some degree of inherent stability.
MachinePorn,3csfaq,Meathe,9,Fri Jul 10 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"The Horten Brothers started building gliders in 1933, built their first flying wing sailplane in 1937, and by the end of the war were designing  flying wings (with jet engines) for the Luftwaffe and designed the Horten H.XVIII (Northrop Grumman - who were working on flying wings at the same time - built a Ho229 replica).     If anyone on the planet should have been confident with a flying wing designed by themselves, it was the Horton brothers."
MachinePorn,3csfaq,sverdrupian,6,Fri Jul 10 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Experience is one thing but they are still battling basic physics and aerodynamics. It only takes a slight human error at the controls to create an exponentially growing instability.    Ok, as /u/cbraga and /u/thetrueonion point out, it does seem possible to design a stable flying wing if you know what you are doing."

MachinePorn,3csfaq,iheartrms,2,Fri Jul 10 19:00:13 2015 UTC,I designed and flew my own radio control flying wings in high school. You don't need to know all that much. The rules are very basic and the same as for any other aircraft.
MachinePorn,3csfaq,misunderstandgap,8,Fri Jul 10 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"If anyone on the planet should have been confident with a flying wing designed by themselves, it was the Horton brothers.   ...who had a fatal crash with the Ho-229 prototype, an aircraft which never entered production. Northrop and Armstrong-Whitworth also suffered major crashes with their various prototypes once they tested them enough. Flying wings have a lot of aerodynamic advantages, but they're just not stable. Whether this stability is inherent to flying wings, or due to insufficient research, I don't know, and it's possible that this design solved it with computer simulation. However, back in the 40's and 50's, nobody was confident in flying wings, despite the demonstrated advantages. I wouldn't say ""people built prototypes, which only sometimes crashed"" is a strong enough reason to ignore potential safety concerns."
MachinePorn,3csfaq,iheartrms,4,Fri Jul 10 15:01:43 2015 UTC,Why do people think flying wings are inherently unstable? Ever seen a Zagi radio controlled airplane? Ever seen a hang glider? They are indeed inherently stable.
MachinePorn,3csfaq,misunderstandgap,2,Fri Jul 10 19:45:46 2015 UTC,"I've been reading up on it on the homebuilder forum. Apparently in a flying wing, the tradeoff between stability, stall performance, and efficiency is much tighter, and so flying wings that are easy to control are often less efficient than conventional designs. There's also a stronger sensitivity to CG changes."
MachinePorn,3csfaq,iheartrms,2,Fri Jul 10 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"This is all true, due to the shorter moment arm of the flying wing. Nevertheless, it is still quite reasonable to work with. I have taught a number of people how to fly radio control airplanes on flying wings. I wish I could have the opportunity to fly a full scale flying wing! I have flown a lot of different kinds of full scale aircraft but never a flying wing."
MachinePorn,3csfaq,misunderstandgap,2,Fri Jul 10 20:39:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense. The main point they were talking about is that with a RC plane, the CG never shifts. With a big airliner, there are enough people that you can get the CG pretty even just by moving people around. With a bomber, you can put the bomb bay at the CG, so the CG doesn't move. With a one-person plane that you always fly yourself, you know your weight so the CG is constant.  But with a 2 or 4 person plane? Passengers and luggage really affect the CG a lot, and it's really tough to balance everything out to make the aircraft work well."
MachinePorn,3csfaq,Vehudur,8,Fri Jul 10 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"All early jets had lots of crashes. There's a reason it was a big deal to be a test pilot.  As far as flying wings being inherently unstable unless controlled by a computer... I guess my RC flying wing, which is an amazing, stable, reliable and fun little flying machine doesn't exit then, huh?  Regardless of the stability of any individual aircraft, all modern military fixed wing aircraft have a fly by wire system. It's to eek out every last drop of optimal flight performance, and computers are better at figuring how to squeeze those last few drops of performance out than we are. As long as a computer can figure out how to keep it in the air, we can build it at this point."
MachinePorn,3csfaq,misunderstandgap,5,Fri Jul 10 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"No, even the prop-based flying wings were beset by crashes. I'm not saying that flying wings are inherently unstable. However, saying that flying wings are stable because some prototypes were built in the 40's makes no sense. The prototypes he was using to argue that Horten designs are inherently good were...simply not that great.   In other words, arguing that a flying wing named ""Horten"" must be a good aircraft makes as much sense as arguing that the German Space Program must be very impressive, because they invented the V2. A small amount of heritage only takes you so far.  And yeah, the homebuilt community does seem to think that flying wings can be very stable, but have other drawbacks. This, of course, is based off of many decades more experience and research."

Or the restored Northrop N-9M which I have seen fly several times at the local airshow. Or the many other Horten and Northrop flying wings of many years ago before computers and fly by wire. There is nothing inherently unstable about a flying wing. As long as the CG is ahead of the aerodynamic center it's stable. -- A professional commercial pilot
MachinePorn,3csfaq,tomparker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"And moving it back, back, back 'til they're closer together decreases drag at the expense of stability, until they're so close together, stability becomes neutral, and it takes a fly-by-wire system to keep it stable. My guess is that the more stable and controllable a flying wing is the more it gives up in terms of efficiency, but this is true with many other aircraft designs."
MachinePorn,3csfaq,cbraga,2,Sat Jul 11 03:51:55 2015 UTC,"That goes for all modern figther planes actually so that the very last drop of performance can be squeezed out. And not that modern even, look at the F-16 does that look like an airframe that's stable by itself? OTOH flying wings can be designed with a degree of aerodynamic stability.   For example the Northrop N-9M precursor to the XB-35 built in the 40s is still airworthy today and flown by the museum that keeps it, I'm sure that wouldn't be the case if it were dangerous to fly."

MachinePorn,3csfaq,hotfuzz86,2,Fri Jul 10 14:02:41 2015 UTC,My sentiments match /u/sverdrupian's exactly:  Modern flying wings such as the B-2 maintain stable flight because of sophisticated computer-controlled feedback-loops which constantly adjust the flight surfaces to counter the inherent instability of the design. I can't imaging this home-brew aircraft has a fly-by-wire system.

MachinePorn,3csfaq,Vehudur,4,Fri Jul 10 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"It's a very deceptive comment. All modern military fixed wing aircraft have a fly by wire system, and most could not be flown safely without their computers. Many of them, not just the fixed wing aircraft, are unstable and they simply have too many inputs for the human brain to safely keep track of, so most of the ""heavy lifting"", so to speak, is done by the computer. The pilot simply tells the computer what direction they'd like the aircraft to go, and the computer figures out the best way to do it."

From Wikipedia:   The majority of the designs were modified forms of the Churchill tank or the Sherman tank. Both were available in large numbers. The Churchill had good (though slow) cross-country performance, heavy armour, and a roomy interior. The Sherman's mechanical reliability was valued. Among the many specialist vehicles and their attachments were:   Crocodile: A Churchill tank modified by the fitting of a flame-thrower in place of the hull machine gun. An armoured trailer, towed behind the tank, carried 400 Imperial gallons (1,800 litres) of fuel. The flamethrower had a range of over 120 yards (110 metres), far greater than man-portable units. Regarded as a powerful psychological weapon, this flame tank proved highly effective at clearing bunkers, trenches and other German fortifications. AVRE (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers): A Churchill tank adapted to attack German defensive fortifications. The crew of six were drawn from the Royal Engineers, except for the driver who came from the Royal Armoured Corps. One of the RE crew was a demolitions NCO sapper responsible for priming the ""Flying dustbin"" as well as leading or supervising when they dismounted from the tank (easily done through the side hatches) to place demolition charges (""Wade"" charges). The AVRE's main gun was replaced by a Petard Mortar that fired a forty-pound (18 kg) HE-filled projectile (nicknamed the ""Flying dustbin"") 150 yards (137 m); it was capable of destroying concrete obstacles such as roadblocks and bunkers. The mortar had to be reloaded externally by opening a hatch and sliding a round into the mortar tube from the hull.   AVREs were also used to carry and operate equipment such as:   Bobbin: A reel of 10-foot (3.0 m) wide canvas cloth reinforced with steel poles carried in front of the tank and unrolled onto the ground to form a ""path"", so that following vehicles (and the deploying vehicle itself) would not sink into the soft ground of the beaches during the amphibious landing. Fascine: A bundle of wooden poles or rough brushwood lashed together with wires carried in front of the tank that could be released to fill a ditch or form a step. Metal pipes in the centre of the fascine allowed water to flow through. Small Box Girder: An assault bridge that was carried in front of the tank and could be dropped to span a 30-foot (9.1 m) gap in 30 seconds. Bullshorn Plough: A mine plough intended to excavate the ground in front of the tank, to expose and make harmless any land mines. Double Onion: Two large demolition charges on a metal frame that could be placed against a concrete wall and detonated from a safe distance. It was the successor to the single-charge device Carrot."

MachinePorn,3coy4s,Ken-the-pilot,26,Thu Jul 9 16:34:31 2015 UTC,"The timber and mining industries in the United States during the Post-Civil War era were just starting to use short railroad systems to move their materials out of the sticks. These railroads, however, traversed rough terrain and had to be built in less-than-desirable locations. Steam locomotives at the time simply could not handle the steep grades, tight curves and poorly laid trackage. While it could be done, logging and mining companies had to work with very small locomotives such as tank engines and use small pieces of rolling stock to help negotiate these lines. Most companies stuck to using animals, skids and sleighs as the primary means of transportation.  Enter Ephraim Shay. In the 1870s, Shay, a logger and inventor, began playing around with the idea of building a different kind of locomotive with far-greater flexibility than a regular steam engine. A boiler and water tank were mounted on a four-truck flatcar. The boiler was connected to a Crippens Engine: a drivetrain that utilized a central crankshaft that operated a series of gears connected to driving wheels. By 1877, Shay had produced his first prototype and spent the next year or so improving and testing his concept. It proved to be popular especially with logging companies. He began building his engines with the help of William Crippen & Son Manufacturing.  The original Shay locomotive looked very different than what the final Shay design would look like. This stemmed from a series of improvements and modifications to the original design that culminated into an 1881 patent issued to Shay. Shay had partnered with his long-time associate the Lima Machine Works (later the Lima Locomotive Works), who sent an engineer/machinist to help refine Shay’s design. This new locomotive replaced the Crippens Engine with a series of vertical cylinders mounted on one side that connected to a crankshaft. This crankshaft in turn connected to a series of bevel gears located on trucks.  The new design also featured a series of universal and prismatic joints along the crankshaft, which greatly improved the locomotive’s flexibility. Now, the series of trucks could pivot and move freely from one another and could negotiate uneven trackage and tight curves. Another benefit of this system was that with the drivetrain spread out over the entire engine, the tractive effort of the Shay could come from the entire weight of the locomotive.   With the help of Lima, a series of Shays were built of increasing size that could suit the need of the largest (and smallest) of companies looking to buy. Shays were classified by the number of cylinders a locomotive had as well as the number of powered wheelsets it had. Class A Shays were the smallest and featured two cylinders and two sets of powered trucks. The largest were the Class D series and were equipped with three cylinders and four sets of powered trucks (Class C Shays also had this arrangement, but the Class D Shays had greater fuel capacity and thus had a higher adhesion factor). Tractive effort ranged between about 16,000 pounds to as high as 35,100 pounds. Weight ranged from as little as 6 tons to as high as 150 tons. Lima created an aggressive advertising campaign that showed the benefits of the Shay over the two other competing geared locomotive designs of the time; the Climax and the Heisler.  Shays were excellent locomotives built with a very rugged design. They could negotiate grades as high as 6% (most well-built railroads have a grade no higher than 2%) and featured water tenders big enough to hold plenty of water, since access to quality boiler water in remote areas may be difficult. Shays were reliable and easy to work on since moving parts were located along the outside of the engine. They were multi-talented and could be used to pull and push cars and even drag logs out of harder to reach areas. Over time, improvements and innovations were added to the Shays to keep them up to date with modern railroading. Superheaters and closed cabs were added on some Shays and many featured electric lighting. Total, over 3500 Shays were built for railroads all over the world. Many Shays would last into the 1950s and 60s as their rugged design and flexibility enabled continued usage in parts of the world where trackage was poor."

MachinePorn,3coy4s,vonHindenburg,3,Fri Jul 10 00:08:46 2015 UTC,"Now, HERE’s a picture of a small Shay running on wooden rails.  And there’s plenty of evidence of Climaxes running on raw logs using big, double-flanged wheels.  Does anyone know of a picture of a Shay kitted up like this?  I suppose the exterior driveshaft of the shay would make extending the wheels in such a manner more difficult than would the interio    r arrangement of the other manufacturers."
MachinePorn,3coy4s,vonHindenburg,2,Fri Jul 10 12:39:19 2015 UTC,Here's a picture showing a similar set up. I'm guessing that all three geared locomotives could have been set up to run on log rails. I didn't even know rails like that were even used. It seems dangerous.
MachinePorn,3coy4s,th7957,5,Fri Jul 10 13:53:53 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no.  A few points:   These are typically a very wide gauge.  The Climax that I linked has rails 8 feet apart.  I actually found it as an answer to “What was the widest railroad gauge ever”.  That’s as wide as a tractor trailer and with a much lower center of gravity.  You could probably get those rails a foot or so out of level before you’d be looking at a tip/derailment. You’re moving very slow.  <10 mph at all times.  At that speed, not only are vibration and lateral forces all be non-existent, but those big, double flanges on their very flexible mountings would actually be able to force mislaid, but loosely-laid track into alignment.   At low speed and with all powered axels, you could probably stop in time if a log cracked under your front truck and still have enough adhesion to back onto the good rails.  Replacement is 1, 2, 3.  And, even if you did derail, you’re surrounded by and carrying work crews, spare ‘rail’, and giant levers.     EDIT: That certainly looks like a Shay drivetrain in your link.  I am a bit surprised that they managed it.  On a Climax or Heisler, the driveshaft runs down the center of the locomotive, meaning that you can do whatever you want to the wheels without changing those linkages.  On a Shay, extending the wheels outwards means that you get a lot more motion on the universals and prism joints of the drive train and that you would have to either move the engine further outboard or make some other arrangement to keep everything lined up.    It does look like the gear ratio on the one that you link is lower than in the diagrams above.  That would certainly make sense."
MachinePorn,3coy4s,Szepano,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"Good points. Widening the wheelbase would be a good first step and seems logical enough. Low speed makes sense too. A Shay's top speed depended on the gear ratio of the bevel gears. If I recall correctly, they very rarely reached speeds of 20-25 MPH for very long."

MachinePorn,3co5l0,skfl,5,Thu Jul 9 12:43:50 2015 UTC,"So assuming it is shaving down the contour of the wheel, if one wheel on an axle set has a greater degree of untrue-ness, it will require more material to be shaved off in order to make it true. This means that there is the potential for it to end up a different diameter than the wheel on the other end of the axle. And then assuming it counts for that and over machines the other wheel to match, that would mean that there is the potential for different wheel diameters in a bogie set, which seems like it would be bad for locomotive motors, unless they can individually control specific motors in the bogie. So it seems like a flawed design unless I'm missing something??"
MachinePorn,3co5l0,everylittlebitcounts,5,Thu Jul 9 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"Your first two assumptions are correct; within a wheel set you want the diameters to match within a relatively tight tolerance which is defined by the governing body for that track. Then within a bogie you need similar diameter wheel sets within a certain tolerance again defined by whoever owns/runs that system. The flaw in this case is whatever is causing the uneven wear on the wheel; could be the track, the bogie, the braking system, etc… It would be up to the operator to perform whatever truing is required to meet the tolerances of the governing body. For instance we have seen a 1-5-10 rule in freight applications where the wheel diameters must be within 1mm of each other in a wheel set, the wheel sets must be within 5mm of each other in a bogie, and the average wheel set diameter of the two bogies of a car must be within 10mm of each other."

MachinePorn,3ceths,minichado,9,Tue Jul 7 21:40:30 2015 UTC,"More likely a Manganese steel, higher toughness.  Moly and tungsten are used for alloying based on modulus, and can help heat treat to fully martensitic steels with a Rockwell close to 52-56 HRc, def harder than an aluminum block but it wears out pretty quick.   Source: I was the metallurgist at a steel/white iron ceramic composite manufacturing plant (foundry). We made big ass castings for crushing and grinding industry. Several ""hammers"" used for crushing whatever in recycleries. Toughness is more important than hardness for these applications, high temperature tempers were used to get high toughness for these applications.   Abraisive, low impact applications used white irons (high hardness, brittle). Higher impact used steel (higher toughness, lower hardness). Recycling applications used highest toughness (tempered to have high toughness on working end, but relatively soft.   Edit: Should also mention I did failure analysis and end of life analysis for wear parts after they were used, to input back into production and improve product quality. Used recycling bits look horrendous after the fact. They do not stay shiny white for long."

MachinePorn,3cbccp,NookNookNook,2,Mon Jul 6 17:52:33 2015 UTC,"It was a gamble, and we were prepared to fall back to Shawsville if necessary.  The site was full of construction equipment, and the crew was actively working on raising the height of the bore of the right hand tunnel.  From what I heard from others out there, NS was turning people away on Thursday who had come out to ask if they'd be allowed to photograph from there, but there were no railroad cops on hand this weekend and as long as the photographers stayed a safe distance back, the construction workers didn't chase anyone away.  It's not as fantastic a shot as if there wasn't construction equipment scattered around, but it kind of is the iconic location for those westbound runs to be photographed.  If I could only change one thing about how all of yesterday went, I probably would have tried to factor in shooting from either a higher or lower angle at one spot -- either getting the train crossing a bridge from below, or getting on an overpass to get a high angle shot of the train.

Edelbrock is a company that is primarily known for making popular high-end aftermarket carburetors and intake manifolds for muscle cars. It's fairly common to see them used in restorations like the one you've got here. The 440 was a beast of an engine, the largest that Chrysler made at the time. It's a 7.2 liter! In terms of raw horsepower, the 426 (7 liter) Hemi made more, but the 440 is considered the easier-to-drive engine and better for cruising the street.

MachinePorn,3c3x3n,ellevehc,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:18:04 2015 UTC,"It was pretty common for four barrel carbs to have a little spring loaded flap that would block off 2 of the barrels. This allowed for adequate velocity through the 2 barrels in use when the engine wasn't under much load, while under higher loads the flap would be sucked out of the way and allow maximum airflow.  Multiple carbs were mostly a way to deal with how shit carbureted engines are at distributing the fuel evenly between cylinders."

MachinePorn,3c3x3n,ellevehc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:49:30 2015 UTC,Even good old port injection solves most of these problems. You can build a much better intake manifold if it only has to move air.

MachinePorn,3bqvib,broethbanethmenot,7,Wed Jul 1 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"The original plans were all done by hand.  I was working on the fourth, I think, version of the craft and all new drawings at the time were done in AutoCAD R14, R2000 or R2002.  Since I was the least experienced person working on this, a large part of my time was spent getting the old hand drawings into autoCAD and then checking if the various components and their assemblies would actually fit together."
MachinePorn,3bqvib,Excelsior_i,4,Wed Jul 1 21:19:52 2015 UTC,I worked as mechanical Design Engineer for 3 years doing the same thing except that I would port AutoCad designs into 3D CAD and see if it worked. But how much help did you get from the shop? Did you often go down to the shop floor to check any conflicts ?
MachinePorn,3bqvib,broethbanethmenot,8,Wed Jul 1 22:10:20 2015 UTC,"Most of the old drawings were pretty good.  There were some issues with some of the old drawings but nothing that wasn't remedied by tightening up the tolerances.  I worked for the shop that did a large portion of the actual fabrication for arktos, so I had as much help from the shop as I wanted.  Generally, the folks working in the steel and aluminium shops were pretty damn helpful, the fellow running the machining shop was not.  I had more issues with arktos not properly communicating changes to me or to the shop I was working for.    Another sizable portion of my job was redoing arktos' drawings for the shop that I worked for so that they were more easily used by the fabricators.  Most of the issues in that regard were with the deck and the seating inside the craft itself.  By far, most of the conflicts and issues I had were with the radiator.  The radiator on the version I worked on was built with out any real plan.  I had to go on the arktos, measure it up after it was installed, do the drawing and report back to the fabricator who was in charge of making it.  He and the folks working at arktos would then make changes to it and not inform each other or me.  As far as I know, the guy who was doing the fabrication of the radiator ending up doing the drawing himself as I was never given all of the info necessary to do a proper drawing of it."
MachinePorn,3bqvib,Excelsior_i,3,Wed Jul 1 22:21:04 2015 UTC,"I worked in German firm for quite some time and you are right, the fabricators have their own versions of drawings that they use. One of my managers joked that they can make a whole machine blindfolded and drunk since they have been making it for decades now.  Communicating with the shop is one of the many aspects that seem to take a lot of effort for Design Engineers. This is something you only learn with experience.

MachinePorn,3bgzyi,InappropriateLaugher,13,Mon Jun 29 06:21:30 2015 UTC,"Singer 911's don't really have years. You order a car to your exact specifications and Singer constructs a car using old and new build parts (you can provide a donor car if you like) to create a perfect blend of all the air cooled Porsches (by hand), suspension from this model, lights from another, chuck out the whole body and make a new carbon fiber monocoque, modern brembos concealed under extra large Fuch's wheels, etc. . To justify their $400,000+ price tag the car includes many coach built elements, including touches such as the leather from the rear seats extending into the engine bay. Imagine somebody built a GT500 replica that looked like a '67 and raced like a 2015. That's basically what this is in Porsche form. They are essentially new cars, classed as rebuilds to appease the EPA and CARB."

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, But I assume the reason for the distortion is either the dramatic pressure or temperature gradient in the shockwave envelope (no idea if that is correct terminology) is changing the refractive index of the air fast enough that we can see it before it diffuses/mixes.   Also, not sure but it looks like the bulk of the distortion is in the rear 1/3rd of the plane - while there is a nearly vertical filament right behind the pilot's head. I assume that's normal, I just wouldn't have expected too see it there. Maybe its an image processing artifact?"

MachinePorn,3b2qeu,skpkzk2,2,Thu Jun 25 23:27:18 2015 UTC,it's a very good approximation for air
MachinePorn,3b2qeu,RonnieTheEffinBear,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:04:01 2015 UTC,"It can be, if the air doesn't undergo very large temperature swings. Specific heat is only a weak function of temperature so you can often just ignore the dependence, but if you're analyzing something like a gas turbine where the air temp might make a 1000K fluctuation, the ideal gas approximation starts to break down."
MachinePorn,3b2qeu,PhaethonPrime,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"well yes, it's the isentropic relation so it's only valid for isentropic processes. In something like a jet engine, you are doing work on the system so it better not be isentropic. The temperature swings can still be large as long as there is no heat addition and the air is only heated adiabatically."

What you are seeing is the change in density due to compressibility. If you remember your basic physics, light refracts when traveling through media of different densities. Pressure, temperature, and density all are changing dramatically at the same time, so the idea that it's pressure isn't wrong, but the refraction needs a density change to occur.  See, for example, Schlieren photography."

MachinePorn,3an5e0,gsfgf,10,Mon Jun 22 03:39:44 2015 UTC,You can't shut down on MRI machine without discharging the helium in the magnet (quenching) which costs a LOT of money to refill and risk damaging the magnet. They do use specialized nonferrous tools.

MachinePorn,3an5e0,sharksandwich81,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:15:49 2015 UTC,"True they can ramp down, also to retrieve objects stuck in the chamber but quenching will never vent into the room, its done through a vent into the atmosphere.

MachinePorn,3an5e0,Pepper-Fox,3,Mon Jun 22 14:28:53 2015 UTC,Yes normally they quench through a pipe that goes through the roof.

MachinePorn,3af7ei,swordfish45,7,Fri Jun 19 17:29:28 2015 UTC,When you really need to hydroseed    You mean that this is actually heliborne seeding ?
MachinePorn,3af7ei,liotier,19,Fri Jun 19 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's used on unstable hillsides where the previous vegitation was burned by wildfire. It might be too steep / too unstable / whatever to send people up there.  Plant roots are critical for soil stability - the importance of this cannot be understated. They literally hold the dirt together. If the plants burn up, the roots die (or burn) and can no longer hold the soil. Healthy roots are very strong (ever tried pulling a weed with deep roots?), but burned or dead and decaying roots are not strong at all. The next time heavy rainfall happens, nothing is there to stop it from washing the soil away and forming huge mudslides.  The thing about the coast ranges in California is that there are a lot of poorly consolidated sediments in high places where the only thing holding them in place is the roots of vegetation and friction. The effects of rainfall can easily overcome friction. California also suffers from frequent droughts, and these same plants become quite flammable indeed when dry. That's why they have such a severe mudslide problem.  So when you're looking at doing this, you have to ask a few questions:   Is the slope unstable because of the destruction of vegetation? (yes) Is there a high risk of mudslides if nothing is done? (so much yes) Can whatever is below the unstable slope be reinforced to the point of withstanding a mudslide for less cost than this? (almost always no) Can whatever is below the unstable slope be moved? (rarely yes)   Once you have these answers, you can decide if an expensive method like this of reseeding is worth it or not. It tends to be. Mudslides are really bad news."

Thanks for your explanation.  Also, when dumping a few tons of water/seeds slurry, how the hell do the seed spread properly over anything but a relatively small splash zone... And how do they plant themselves anywhere instead of following the rushing water into whatever thalweg it flows along ?"
MachinePorn,3af7ei,liotier,4,Fri Jun 19 22:56:31 2015 UTC,"The water soaks into the soil a bit, and some of the seeds will get lodged in there with it. A lot of it WILL just run off, but enough will stay and all of that mist produced contains seed too, and won't be concentated enough on the ground to flow away readily while still delivering seeds of a much bigger area than one would expect. It doesn't look like it in the picture, but this water is being dropped from VERY high up.   It's far from a perfect solution, but it's better than doing nothing."
MachinePorn,3af7ei,Vehudur,2,Fri Jun 19 23:14:44 2015 UTC,how the hell do the seed spread properly   You do the drop perpendicular to the slope above and slightly upwind of the highest burnt area. The slurry carries the seeds out and down from there.

MachinePorn,3a6dax,Ken-the-pilot,57,Wed Jun 17 16:08:47 2015 UTC,"After World War II, the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, like many coal-hauling railroads, saw a decrease in coal demand. Ships, locomotives and homes were all converting to oil and gas as the primary means of power as it was cheaper and easier to handle. Coal was cheap to use and plentiful in the regions the C&O serviced. Much of the railroad’s revenue came from hauling coal from the Appalachian Mountains to ports in the east, so it had further incentive to keep coal the primary means for fuel.  The C&O wanted to show that coal was still an excellent energy source while also bringing itself into the future. The railroad began work on designing a new type of locomotive for a proposed streamliner, the Chessie (named for the railroad's mascot, Chessie), which would run between Washington, D.C. and Cincinnati, Ohio at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour. The railroad wanted to provide an alternative to diesel locomotives; the majority believed to be the future of railroading.  Partnering with the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the C&O sought to design a way to extract energy differently than a regular coal-fired boiler. At this time steam turbines were popular in electric power plants around the world and for years, railroads had been trying to scale them down for use as locomotives. So far, railroads generally agreed that steam turbines were not a good idea. Dirt, grime and soot too easily infiltrated fragile parts and created huge costs associated with maintenance and replacement of parts. Still, the C&O had faith in the concept and in 1947, unveiled their M-1 Class steam turbines.  The M-1s were designed differently than conventional steam locomotives. The cab looked very similar to a conventional steam locomotive. This held true to the steam roots that the engine was built on. They had a typical coal-fired boiler that was built behind the cab of the locomotive. Steam was generated from this boiler at about 310 PSI and was transmitted to a turbine-generator. The turbine-generator then created electrical energy that was fed to eight traction motors and generated about 6,000 horsepower. Coal was stored ahead of the cab in a streamlined bunker while water was carried in a tender behind the locomotive. Despite having quite a few wheels to support the locomotive’s weight, only the first three axles of the main wheelset were powered. The M-1s measured almost 155 feet long coupler to coupler; the longest single unit locomotive in the world at the time. They were heavy too; weighing in at about 856,000 pounds fueled.  The locomotive was unveiled with much fanfare and was showcased as the locomotive of the future. The engine had its own trainset built to go with it for service on the Chessie. The train would move passengers in extreme comfort and luxury and would consist of just a few lounge/dome cars and a large dining car. One of the lounge cars even featured a tropical fish tank filled with exotic fish; unheard of at the time. Total travel time between Washington and Cincinnati (a total distance of about 670 miles) would be about twelve hours.  Three M-1s were built by Baldwin for the planned Chessie. They proved to perform similar to just about every other steam-turbine locomotive ever built. The engines were “supposed” to be designed to run between Washington and Cincinnati and back without servicing. Since there were less moving parts involved, the railroad surmised that the M-1s would require very little servicing. While it produced a great deal of horsepower, and was able to run at high speeds for long periods of time, the locomotive was very unreliable and prone to various mechanical problems. The reason for this was, as stated before, that railroads are dirty – dirt, grime and soot destroyed mechanical components that required a clean environment to operate in. Another problem was that water lines passed alongside electrical lines and leaked; shorting out the traction motors. The locomotives were also very mechanically complicated (and very large) for crews used to working on conventional steam locomotives; making maintenance difficult and even more expensive. In fact, despite a few test runs along portions of the route, the M-1 never actually completed an entire trip between Washington and Cincinnati, as the locomotives constantly broke down.  In addition to locomotive problems, the Baltimore and Ohio railroad beat the Chesapeake to its planned market. The B&O began its own Washington – Cincinnati service in 1947 via the Cincinnatian. This train was experiencing poor revenue and a lower than expected demand. The C&O ran a single full-length test train of the Chessie in 1947 (which broke down enroute). To further demoralize the C&O, it was shown that the vibrations onboard the train successfully killed all of the fish in the tropical fish tank. Shortly afterwards, the C&O cancelled the Chessie project altogether. The three locomotives that were left were too big and complicated for regular service. Despite losing over a million dollars in research, development and implementation, all three M-1 locomotives were scrapped by 1950 and the C&O quickly began dieselization afterwards."
MachinePorn,3a6dax,vonHindenburg,10,Wed Jun 17 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"Great write-up!  Shame about the fish.  I’d only offer two quibbles.   First, steam turbines are still generate most of our electricity.  Whether they’re burning oil, gas, coal, biomatter, or uranium, or running on the waste heat of a natural gas-fired gas turbine, geothermal heat, or solar-thermal heat, the electrons that you’re reading this by were most likely excited by a steam turbine.    Second, it wasn’t the steam turbine itself that couldn’t live with life on the rails, it was the other equipment around it.  Turbine locomotives can really be classified into three main groups.  Non-Condensing Direct Drive, Condensing Direct Drive, and Condensing Electric Drive.  (I don’t think that anyone ever built an NCED, but it’s possible.)    The job of a condenser is to take the steam exiting a turbine (or piston engine) and quickly cool it back into water.  This has two benefits.  The first is that it creates a greater pressure drop from the upstream to downstream side of the turbine, meaning that a given machine will produce more power.  The second is that it allows you to recycle your water, reducing or eliminating the need for tankage stops.  Powerplant turbines and ship turbines used them successfully.  Some steam piston locomotives that ran in extremely dry areas used them to reduce water consumption.  Most turbine locomotives had one because the power gains on a turbine when you increase the pressure drop are much greater than on a piston engine and proponents of turbines wanted to show off the greatest efficiency they could.  However…..  The problems with a condenser are twofold.  First, it’s an extremely large, fragile piece of machinery that has to be completely airtight, while moving a lot of water through it and a lot of air over it.  Frequently, condensers would be on a tender separate from the locomotive, with all the attendant, breakable, water and steam fittings that that entailed.  This was probably part of why they made the M-1 so long:  They were trying to keep the condenser in the body of the loco.    Second, a regular locomotive doesn’t just exhaust the used steam from its cylinders to no good purpose.  This steam is directed up the smoke stack in a jet.  Like the nozzle on a perfume bottle, it sucks smoke along with it, drawing more air through the firebox.  This is why the smoke on a locomotive comes out in discrete ‘puffs’ in time with the cylinders, rather than a continuous stream.    When you’re directing your waste steam into a condenser, you lose this option and have to come up with something else.  Basically, you need to either suck or blow to get air over the fire.  If you blow, you need a pressurized firebox with interlocks that shut down the blower whenever you open the door to add coal.  Otherwise, you get a face full of smoke and hot sparks.  Ash collection also becomes harder.  If you try to replace the normal steam jet in the smoke stack with a fan and suck air through the box, you run into a different set of problems.  Specifically, the unfiltered stack of a coal fire is just about the worst place imaginable for a mechanical device with moving parts.  Fans on engines that tried this were constantly breaking down in the corrosive gasses.  So, weak point number one:  Condensers.  If that’s not enough, let’s add a second.  Specifically, the power station on wheels that the M-1 was lugging around.  The generator set and electric motor.    Turbines have one of the same weakness as modern diesels.  That is, while a steam piston engine develops full torque at zero RPM and maintains nearly the same (fairly low) efficiency through a wide range of speeds, it can be connected directly to the wheels without an intervening transmission.  Modern diesel locomotives use their electric generator/motor sets in the same way that a car uses its transmission.  The diesel can be started and spun up to its ideal RPM before being connected to the wheels.  The electric system then allows a varying load to be placed on the engine, allowing it to stay in its ideal RPM band through a wide range of wheel speeds and power demands.  So, while, obviously, we’ve gotten electric gen sets to work reliably on the vast majority of locomotives around the world, there are a couple advantages enjoyed by modern locomotives that the M-1 didn’t have.  First, diesel is a lot cleaner than coal-fired steam.  No soot, no ash, and (as you point out) no pressurized water and steam.  Second, they’ve just become more reliable.  Early attempts at diesel, gas, and turbines tried all sorts of ways to connect the engine to the wheels, including car-style selectable gearboxes, pneumatic motors, and hydraulic motors.  It was only decades of work on thousands of locomotives that made gen sets as reliable as they are today.  So…  On turbine locomotives, it’s not so much the turbine itself that’s the weak link in maintenance.  It’s what goes around it much of the time:  The condensers and the transmission (usually an electric gen set).  On the couple occasions where railroads built simple turbine-powered locomotives, based on conventional designs, lacking a condenser and utilizing direct drive to the wheels, they did quite well.  I’d draw your attention specifically to the LMS Turbomotive and the PRR S2.  These two engines accepted less turbine efficiency in favor of not dragging around the large, fragile condenser and heavy steam usage at low speed in order to not have a complex transmission/gen set.    Both proved reliable and efficient when able to run at speed.  Both were easy to maintain.  Both accomplished another goal of turbines:  Reducing hammer blow wear on rails.    Both ran for many years with WWII and the end of the steam era being more the cause of their demises than lack of economy.    TLDR:  It’s not the turbine that’s unreliable.  It’s the equipment that people hook up to it (condensers and electric generators) that breaks down.  Direct drive, non-condensing turbines were a reliable, efficient choice for locomotive power.  They just came too late to be used at scale."
MachinePorn,3a6dax,vonHindenburg,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:46:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for clearing that up! You seem to know your stuff about turbines. I was a little thrown off by how the S2 was able to be used with fairly reasonable performance numbers (above a certain speed) yet most other railroads never got with them.  Another series of turbines that actually worked out for the better were the Union Pacific's Gas Turbines that used heavy fuel oil for power. The UP used their GTELs for almost 20 years and produced three different models throughout their lives.
MachinePorn,3a6dax,Maxrdt,3,Thu Jun 18 14:04:04 2015 UTC,"I work for a company that builds steam turbines, so it’s a subject near and dear to my heart.  :)  Gas turbines are awesome in terms of power to weight and power to size.  (As were those UP engines.)  S’why they’re so popular in airplanes, helicopters, and naval vessels.  (All new USN ships that aren’t powered by nukes use gas turbines.)   They do, of course, suck at fuel efficiency, though.  There’re some interesting developments in shipboard power that might improve this.  Specifically, smaller turbines that use CO2 as a working fluid, which can scavenge most of the waste heat that the gas turbines put off, improving their fuel efficiency to nearly equal a diesel engine.  Compared to the steam turbines used in land-based natural gas/steam turbine cogeneration plants, these CO2 spinners are far more compact and don’t require a boiler or complex water-handling devices.  This makes them suitable for shipboard use.    Who knows?  Maybe if this tech takes off in ships, we’ll see it migrate to locomotives and we’ll, once again, hear the earsplitting roar of a jet engine on rails!"

MachinePorn,39xclm,horsespower,5,Mon Jun 15 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"It also offers the possibility of a smaller and lighter gearbox (or even direct drive, I'm not sure) - electric motors tending to have better performance in the 5-10k RPM regime, and conventional props being down around 1000RPM and below (depending on size)."
MachinePorn,39xclm,hexapodium,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:36:53 2015 UTC,Direct drive.   There are electric driven belt reductions among the ultralights but they are getting rarer as e-motor choices expand.
MachinePorn,39xclm,HAL-42b,9,Mon Jun 15 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"Props are better because they are able to move more air, but they lose a lot of power from ""wingtip vortices"" and there is a limit to how fast you can move the air. But you need a gearbox to reduce the speed from a ""jet engine"". A duct fan design like what you usually see on airliners' turbofan engines prevent the wingtip vortices using the duct and you can move less air faster. The issues are large fans need to turn slower, this is a issue with using the ""jet engine"" for power since they spin very fan, (there is a gearbox design undergoing testing now) and another issue is the size of the duct, clearances and additional weight.  With the use of the electric motors you can turn the fans whatever speed to give you the best efficiency, so you don't need a gearbox. They must have found that the the fans gave more thrust (less air, faster air, less inefficiencies) vs a prop (more air, slower air, wingtip vortices)."
MachinePorn,39xclm,clay_target_clubs,5,Mon Jun 15 23:36:29 2015 UTC,"Also larger fans require more torque, less speed. Smaller fans require less torque, more speed.

MachinePorn,39xclm,picodroid,2,Mon Jun 15 20:52:40 2015 UTC,"Porsche may have gotten their batteries to store double the energy. Lithium based batteries have only about doubled in capacity in the last decade. It's a slow crawl.   I'm betting on an entirely new battery being the next big leap. It'll either be an entirely different internal structure, or at least a new material to store the electricity (such as carbon nanotubes).

MachinePorn,39xclm,misunderstandgap,2,Mon Jun 15 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"Battery technology has been improving at a glacial pace compared to everything else in tech   Just because something isn't improving as quickly as processors are doesn't mean that it's stagnant. It looks like battery Wh/kg has doubled about every 10 years or so, so I wouldn't rule out electric aircraft just yet--especially since NASA and Boeing have started sounding enthusiastic about distributed electric propulsion on aircraft. (Not that I'm saying that batteries have reliable exponential improvement--battery technology appears to improve more irregularly).  And since this aircraft is designed to be a minimum operating cost trainer, I wouldn't extrapolate its limitations too far, either.   The Embraer EMB-120 has 3600 shp and has a mtow of 11500kg, for 0.31 shp/kg. The E-Fan has 80 shp and a mtow of 500kg, for 0.16 shp/kg, on an aircraft optimized for low operating cost and low speed. The technology obviously isn't ready to replace turboprops, but I certainly wouldn't write off electric aircraft in the next 20 years. Airlines pay big premiums for slightly more fuel-efficient jetliners, and you would expect that an electric aircraft uses much less fuel than a turboprop would."

MachinePorn,39xclm,misunderstandgap,2,Mon Jun 15 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"I expect it will, starting with small commercial prop planes. Short routes allow frequent recharging.

And wasn't there a study about using supercapacitors for electrical transport some time ago?"
MachinePorn,39xclm,daveburnt,2,Mon Jun 15 22:54:42 2015 UTC,"Or 1L 85 octane engine producing 60kW to power both! Or two of them?  Probably far more fuel efficient, and no gearboxes."
MachinePorn,39xclm,P-01S,2,Tue Jun 16 11:51:07 2015 UTC,"85 octane? Where'd that come from?  Anyway, fuel efficiency is complicated. There would still be losses in every step from gas to thrust... as the 2nd law of thermodynamics demands.  One big advantage though is that an engine powering a generator can work at constant speed; the engine is run at its ideal RPM and the output shaft is geared to match the ideal RPM of the generator. For larger planes, gas generators would be usable. Gas generators are more efficient than IC engines at ideal speed, but their fuel consumption does not decrease much as output power is decreased. An electrically powered plane could have battery banks with sufficient charge to make a safe landing in an emergency and carry a small gas turbine generator (APU) to provide enough electricity to make it through the flight without running dangerously low on charge. Although that would add a lot of complication and weight, and the APU would need to be able to be started in flight, adding further complication... I don't know. Just thinking aloud.  The downside of electric airliners is that they would rely on propellers, which would bring back all sorts of issues... Noise, power output, low service ceiling, and so on. Supersonic props would be too loud to use. Passengers probably wouldn't be happy, but if they are super efficient, maybe for cargo?"

Of course a tuned turbine would be ideal, and like you said, just enough battery capacity for 30 mins (ironically roughly the same run time as RC planes). You could burn ethanol instead too, or hydrogen if you wanna get really efficient, but yeah, electric is the way of the future methinks.   We could use pond hoppers like nobody's business in the north. Mixing bush planes and commercial helis is just burning money so hard, can't do this, can't do that, it's really stupid."

MachinePorn,39h87v,JeffroGymnast,3,Fri Jun 12 02:14:24 2015 UTC,Disclaimer - I am not a mechanic or a car technician.  I would guess that the chains need a lot of slack to handle all the different temperatures involved because of expansion and contraction.  So those plastic things are chain tensioners that keep the chain taught even when they're slack and they can move in and out to keep the same tension on the chain no matter the temperature.  Thats my guess.
MachinePorn,39h87v,mrhelios,3,Fri Jun 12 12:04:51 2015 UTC,Close! It has to do with using oil pressure to keep tension on the chains across the Rev range to preserve the timing between crank and cams

When I was a red seal tech for Honda, most of the dealer mechanics drove Hondas. Access to dealer parts near cost and deals on new/used trade-ins make owning a car of the brand you work for a good deal.

How do you create a bolt that can withstand such temperature fluctuations, in which a flaw just a few nanometers apart could cause it to break? That sort of thing.    It's the same with fighter jets, which I'm also really interested in. Countries like China can copy airframe designs all they want, but the difficulty is in the decades of materials engineering required to make it stay together, withstand speeds and temperatures, etc etc. Which is why they're struggling to build an engine worthy of a fifth gen fighter for the J20 and J31."

Hence, this photo has a little emotional value to me."
MachinePorn,397ac9,joe-h2o,6,Wed Jun 10 19:16:31 2015 UTC,"I never understood how that thing worked. I still don't really get it.  Once the module is retracted, how do they actually open a hatch? Where does that probe thing GO? Do they stow it somewhere? What keeps the seal between two positively pressurized vehicles in the vacuum of space?"
MachinePorn,397ac9,horsespower,6,Tue Jun 9 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"The whole affair is removed as part of the docking tunnel port. Once it's retracted and hard docked, they can remove the whole thing from the tunnel and pass through.   The seals (one at either end) are part of the tunnel. This thing just allows them to touch the two spacecraft together at about 10 inches apart loosely - they latch together with the latches on the tip of the probe) and then manually/electrically ratchet them together the last little bit when the main clamps can take over.   The probe on the end of that adapter can be wound in and out about 10 inches which is done when they dock but also when they undock - the procedure to separate is to depress the tunnel, wait for a bit to ensure neither craft is leaking into it, then unlatch and hit the extend button which pushes the spacecraft apart. When they're separated like this, then the LEM can fire its RCS system a little to continue moving away under its own power.   The hatch is visible in some scenes in Apollo 13 during the initial explosion scenes - Swigert tells Lovell that he can't get the hatch to seal - this is the hatch and drogue assembly that closes up the docking tunnel, which he can't seem to close up because the spacecraft is twisting and torquing the tunnel making it impossible to make it fit.   Keeping the tunnel pressurised is simply a case of having two pretty solid seals on either end and the ability to control the pressure in all three spaces - CM and LM cabins and the docking tunnel itself. They monitor the pressure in all three and can adjust them as needed to narrow down what might be leaking and attempting to reseat the hatches if necessary.   On Apollo 10, the vent for the tunnel wasn't installed - someone fitted a solid nut on the end of the pipe instead of a nut with holes in so that whatever the guys tried they couldn't vent the tunnel. In the end they vented it out by depressurising the LEM cabin and opening a valve in the hatch between them.  Edit, Jack, not Fred in the film."
MachinePorn,397ac9,ifandbut,3,Wed Jun 10 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"On Apollo 10, the vent for the tunnel wasn't installed - someone fitted a solid nut on the end of the pipe instead of a nut with holes in   WOW. That guy didn't bother coming into work the next day."
MachinePorn,397ac9,joe-h2o,2,Wed Jun 10 09:41:19 2015 UTC,So this probe is what we see in all the pictures of two space craft approaching to dock? Everything from Gemini to Apollo to Space Shuttle to ISS.  I always wondered how this probe folded into some configuration that created a hole that people could move through. I also thought that it might be offset by a few feet and the actual docking tunnel was just so nondescript that I never saw it in the pictures. Never occurred to me that this was the docking hatch and that it was just removed once they were completely docked.
MachinePorn,397ac9,ltjpunk387,3,Wed Jun 10 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"This is specifically Apollo's docking adapter - the Shuttle's is slightly different and Gemini never did crew transfer between vessels.   This is the port on the CM side. The tunnel that is fitted to the top of the LEM during launch has the other piece of this closing it off. When they dock together and retract the two parts are joined together and come away like a big circular trashcan lid. There's also a circular hatch inside the CM that needs to be removed before you can reach the adapter. There's another hatch on the LEM side that allows them to isolate the tunnel from both cabins, but it's not a docking system - that's entirely done with the CM hatch/probe assembly.   Here you can see the probe on the front of Apollo 17's CM as it approaches the LEM in orbit and you can see how the whole thing has to be removed once docked to be able to pass through from the CM cabin.   The reason you don't really ""see"" the tunnel is because it's not very long. It's really just a small space big enough for the docking hardware to fit into that won't bump up against the LEM's hatch. The probe extends about 12 inches in the fully deployed position and when fully retracted the whole assembly almost fits inside the cone side of the drogue, so the tunnel is only about a foot long.   Once they're done with the mission and want to come back to earth the whole adapter is is left in orbit attached to the discarded LEM by breaking it off the top of the CM with pyrotechnic bolts, once they're sure the hatch inside the CM is properly sealed of course!   The docking target is offset from the tunnel, but's aligned with the pilot's eyepiece so he can see it out of the CM's window as he's coming in to dock. On the shuttle this is done with a camera looking at the target."
MachinePorn,397ac9,MasterOfTheManifold,4,Wed Jun 10 15:44:39 2015 UTC,"I'll try my best. The picture shows the probe in the retracted position. For docking, it will extend, and lengthen by a little over a foot. To dock, it slides into the drogue on the LEM, which funnels the tip of the probe into a hole. Once in the hole, those little spring latches on the tip of the probe hold it there. Then, you retract the probe, and it pulls the two ships together. Once they touch, they engage the ""hard dock,"" which is a ring of latches and seals around the outside of the tunnel. Then they can open the hatch and remove the probe and drogue to allow passage between the ships."
MachinePorn,397ac9,Nargousias,2,Thu Jun 11 14:05:28 2015 UTC,I would LOVE to know the answer to these questions!
MachinePorn,397ac9,ltjpunk387,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:14:25 2015 UTC,"I am the same way. Someway thus retracts, a hard dock is achieved and the whole darn thing swings with the hatch to make an open hatch way."

One of the hardest parts of the profile was ensuring that the shuttle could return to earth on US territory which meant that they needed the ability to come in with a slow descent rate during reentry (shallow reentry profile)_. This in turn, increased the heat exposure duration and thus the danger.  What changed everything was digital photography and imaging sensors where the results could be sent electronically. The shuttle program could not be changed at such a late stage but the departure of the reconnaissance mission reduced the need for extra shuttles (and their funding) and the reentry profile."

MachinePorn,38xfkk,jshufro,2,Sun Jun 7 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"Early military surveillance satellites were unable to transmit the pictures taken by their cameras digitally (aka wirelessly, by radio). Instead, after they had taken the photos of their targets, the satellite would jettison a canister containing negatives of the pictures. The canister would fall back to earth thanks to good ole gravity, and once close enough to earth would deploy a parachute. A plane would then fly over and hook the parachute of the canister, retrieving the photos and preventing any possibility of the photos being retrieved by the enemy by catching the canister mid flight."
MachinePorn,38xfkk,TheNaughtyMonkey,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:57:52 2015 UTC,How did the canister deorbit?
MachinePorn,38xfkk,jshufro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:50:46 2015 UTC,That's a damn good question.  It appears that the satellite was low enough (100 miles) that atmospheric drag was used for deorbiting.  Neat image here.
MachinePorn,38xfkk,gburke,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:43:43 2015 UTC,So cool
MachinePorn,38xfkk,ozzimark,0,Mon Jun 8 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly what you mean by deorbit, however, the film capsule could have been jettisoned from the satellite by multiple means of propulsion, either via a spring or possibly a small gun powder charge. After it had been detached from the satellite the force of gravity would have gradually increased on the capsule, as it was originally propelled closer to earth by the satellite. Eventually gravity would become strong enough to overcome the capsule's orbital centripetal force and pull it down through the atmosphere. The capsule would have used small boosters during the descent to to ensure it deployed its parachute over friendly or neutral territory."
MachinePorn,38xfkk,gburke,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:08:43 2015 UTC,"That's not quite how orbital mechanics works. Giving something a downward nudge (towards Earth) while in an otherwise circular orbit results in increased eccentricity. It would take a fairly large nudge to directly result in deorbiting. As /u/TheNaughtyMonkey says, the small amount of drag present at those altitudes was the primary mechanic for bleeding off the velocity that kept the capsule in orbit.  I recommend playing around with /r/KerbalSpaceProgram to get a better feel for how orbital mechanics works!"
MachinePorn,38xfkk,ozzimark,0,Mon Jun 8 17:58:39 2015 UTC,Tell the other guy not me.
MachinePorn,38xfkk,gburke,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"Eventually gravity would become strong enough to overcome the capsule's orbital centripetal force and pull it down through the atmosphere.   I was expanding on this point that you made, specifically. It's not wrong, but highly misleading, since it implies that anything that is given a downward nudge will fall out of orbit as a result of that nudge, which is not the case."
MachinePorn,38xfkk,ozzimark,0,Mon Jun 8 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the subject is that if the capsule was in stable orbit while attached to the satellite, it's velocity is creating a centripetal force (mv2/r) which is great enough to oppose the force of gravity (GMm/r2)  and keep both objects in orbit. When the capsule is jettisoned from the satellite (I'm making the assumption that the capsule is shot straight toward the axis of rotation, in this case earth) the tangential velocity of the capsule would not change, however the radius will become smaller, increasing the force of gravity and therefore causing an acceleration (albeit small, and extremely low value to its jerk function) that would eventually bring the capsule to earth. I can only speculate that drag, or shooting the capsule in a direction behind the satellite's path of travel can only expedite the process, as its tangential velocity would decrease and lower the centripetal force acting against the now ever increasing gravity."
MachinePorn,38xfkk,Ranger207,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, it is not the centripetal force that keeps things in orbit. How can there be a centripetal force without anything affixed to the object to react against? Orbiting can be thought of as simply moving fast enough that you free-fall towards the earth while the earth is continually moving out of the way.  What you have described is a sensible approach for something moving in a straight line with a stationary reference plane, but when travelling in a circle around another body, you have to consider what the effect of any applied forces is on the resulting trajectory, and it's a little bit backwards. In terms of what effect inputs have on the object:   Forward is up Up is backwards Backwards is down Down is Forward     When a downward force is applied to an orbiting object, it does initially move closer to the body it is orbiting. However, that movement results in a higher velocity, and that change in velocity is carried through in the orbit such that the object is now further away from the body it is orbiting after a little more than a half revolution.  Another way to think about it, let's say that there are two objects traveling in the same orbit, one behind another. The one behind wants to pass the one in front. Counter-intuitively, the object that will be doing the passing will fire thrusters in the retrograde direction to slow down, dropping into a lower, but eccentric orbit. This will be faster, as lower orbits always have a higher velocity. One orbit later, the orbital heights will be equal again, and the object that is now in front  will fire thrusters in the prograde direction to speed up to circularize the orbit.  It is a failure to understand this concept that causes much keyboard mashing and overall discontent when trying to dock two spacecraft in KSP, since they do not end up where you would expect from a stationary reference plane."

MachinePorn,38xfjp,tallyrand,6,Sun Jun 7 17:46:07 2015 UTC,Anyone know what the point of high bypass is? Does the bypass provide thrust? Cooling?
MachinePorn,38xfjp,dingman58,14,Sun Jun 7 18:04:11 2015 UTC,"Thrust.   The bulk of a turbofan's thrust is from the air that bypasses the core. You don't need much to run the turbine itself. It's effectively a giant ducted propellor run by a gas turbine.   It makes it very efficient, and very quiet since the loud turbine exhaust is shrouded by the bypass air."
MachinePorn,38xfjp,joe-h2o,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:42:48 2015 UTC,"cool, thanks"
MachinePorn,38xfjp,dingman58,10,Mon Jun 8 03:07:47 2015 UTC,"The bypass is just the air that doesn't go through staged compression and ignition. High bypass engines generate significant amounts of thrust from this air, simply by blowing it out of the back. This means that the engine is more efficient because bypass air doesn't use any fuel to create its thrust. The smaller you can make the ignition portion of the engine and the bigger you can make the bypass, the less fuel the engine will use. Of course, you still have to generate enough usable thrust, which is where the engineering comes in."
MachinePorn,38xfjp,singularissententia,-5,Sun Jun 7 19:09:18 2015 UTC,air doesn't use any fuel to create its thrust   Not really.  You still need to burn fuel to get the energy to turn the fan and get thrust.  Here's some more info on why bypass is used.  wikipedia
MachinePorn,38xfjp,jaasx,11,Sun Jun 7 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"The bypass air doesn't interact with fuel at all. Therefore that portion of the airstream is creating thrust by purely mechanical means, and not chemical. Obviously it's powered by the ignition of the fuel in the compression portion of the engine. This is why I made the distinction between the two and noted that energy still has to be generated by the ignition of fuel."
MachinePorn,38xfjp,singularissententia,5,Sun Jun 7 20:49:25 2015 UTC,"Modern turbofan engines generate 90+% of the thrust from the air that does not pass (bypass) through the combustion part of the engine (the ""turbo"" part). If you increase the turbo's efficiency, you can increase the bypass ratio as a result."
MachinePorn,38xfjp,Xorondras,2,Mon Jun 8 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"You can make use of the power output of the engine two ways. The first way is exhausting a relatively small amount of air/hot gasses at high speeds. For example, low-bypass turbofans used in military jets.  This produces less thrust (and less fuel efficiency) overall, but gives a high top speed for your aircraft.   The second way is to move large amounts of air at lower speeds. This produces a lot more thrust, but your practical top speed is limited to subsonic speeds.  Note that a jet engine can't produce useful levels of thrust, unless the air/and exhaust gasses are leaving the engine at significantly faster speeds than air is entering it.  In practical terms the exhaust velocity should be 2x or more, the aircraft's net forward speed."

MachinePorn,38j0vf,umdmatto,3,Thu Jun 4 22:25:20 2015 UTC,"Source   During the Civil War, advances in technology rendered the conflict bloody and lopsided, as the industrial North churned out weapons, canned food, and uniforms for its far-flung armies and used its superior railroad network to resupply them.  Given this situation, it shouldn’t be too surprising that Confederate inventors scrambled to come up with new ideas to tip the balance. One such idea was the CSS Hunley, the first submarine ever to successfully engage in combat. This helicopter, a model of which is held at the National Air and Space Museum, was another.  Living in Mobile, Ala., engineer William C. Powers saw the effects of the Union blockade of Confederate ports firsthand. Understanding that Confederate naval power wasn’t equal to the task of breaking the Union line, Powers set about inventing a flying machine that could bomb the blockading ships.  Powers’ design used a steam engine for power, and Archimedean screws (four in total, two vertical and two horizontal) for lift and thrust. The design also had a rudder in the rear, meant to allow the operator to steer the helicopter like a boat.  The design had multiple defects. J.G. Leishman, a professor of aerospace engineering, writes that all helicopter models built before the early 20thcentury suffered from a lack of theoretical understanding of aerodynamics, the unavailability of light and powerful engines and building materials for the machine’s body, and a host of other technical problems. “The history of flight documents literally hundreds of failed helicopter inventions,” Leishman writes. “More often than not, the machine just vibrated itself to pieces.”  Powers’ helicopter was never built. Tom Paone of the National Air and Space Museum writes that Powers may have been afraid that a successful helicopter might fall into Yankee hands and be put into mass production in Northern factories, only to return in swarms to wreak havoc on Confederate forces.

MachinePorn,387vzc,Ken-the-pilot,34,Tue Jun 2 14:08:09 2015 UTC,"Arguably one of the best uses of streamlining on a locomotive, the New York Central’s “Dreyfuss” Hudsons were the railroad’s prized showpiece during a time when passenger train travel was nearing its pinnacle. Built under the need for a stronger, faster locomotive to haul express passenger trains along its mainline, the J-Class Hudson type 4-6-4 was a mainstay of the NYC’s passenger operations throughout most of the 1930s and 1940s.   By the late 1920s, it was well understood that steam could be manipulated in a variety of ways to create extreme power. Railroads and locomotive builders were constantly inventing new ways to create massive amounts of steam while improving on what was already known. The American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was one of these manufacturers; answering the NYC’s calls for a newly designed passenger locomotive. ALCO devised the Hudsons to replace the New York Central’s 4-6-2 Pacifics, as they were proving to be inadequate for hauling growing passenger trains. By adding just another trailing truck to the Pacific design, a bigger firebox could be used and thus, more heat and steam could be generated. Add to that a slightly larger boiler and increase in boiler pressure, even distribution of weight and 79” driving wheels and the NYC was presented with one of the best steam locomotive designs of the day. This new locomotive was named the “Hudson” after the Hudson River along which the New York Central’s mainline followed.  The final class of the Hudsons (and the one pictured) was the J-3a class. Ordered in 1937, the railroad enlisted the help of industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss to create a streamlined body for a batch of these engines. All told, about 15 J-3a Class Hudsons were handsomely streamlined and given a matching train set like the one shown in the picture. Many of these featured a fog-grey paint scheme with blue and white stripes running down the length of the tender and matching passenger cars. Others were given a two-tone grey and black scheme on the same streamlined frame. The railroad’s 20th Century Limited and Empire State Express were both pulled with streamlined Hudsons. These locomotives also utilized Scullin-type driving wheels, a rarity on American railroads. The streamlined Hudsons were a focal point of the railroad, and the NYC used them in tons of advertisements and brochures for the length of the locomotive’s service. The large majority of the J’s however looked like this with a conventional body. Streamlined Hudsons weighed about 5500 pounds more than their unstreamlined partners.   The Hudson was designed to be fast, efficient (at speed) and extremely reliable. It had a tractive effort of 53,250 pounds and weighed around 360,000 pounds unstreamlined. It had no problems reaching 100 miles per hour and could maintain that speed consistently without losing steam (i.e. using the steam in the boiler faster than the locomotive can replace it). The J-Class was built for high-speed service and constant use along the flat, graded mainline of the NYC. The tenders of the Hudsons were designed with a small water tank because the NYC utilized trackpans between the rails of most of their mainline. The tenders had a retractable water scoop underneath that could be raised and lowered to pick up water. This innovation allowed the Hudson to carry more coal and travel further distances between refueling. The railroad ordered almost 300 Hudsons throughout the 1930s. They were used extensively and exclusively in passenger service and had an excellent reputation for being quality, good running engines at speed.   However at lower speeds, Hudsons were very inefficient and required the use of a booster engine on the rear wheelset to mitigate the problem (hence why the NYC mainly used the Hudsons on flat, level track). Booster units were undesirable as they were a mechanical headache, but were necessary for getting the Hudson started from a stop and for acceleration to track-line speed. Despite this downside, the Hudsons hauled nearly all of the railroad’s passenger trains until the end of steam in the 1950s.   Many features of the Hudson influenced the design of the NYC’s 6000 horsepower Niagara that would later replace the Hudson on the heaviest trains. The Hudsons were loved by the New York Central and were very well suited for the jobs they handled. However, as diesels took over, the limited flexibility of the Hudson and the desire for new, shiny streamlined EMD E Units were the end of the J-Class. The railroad sent all of their Hudsons to the scrappers and none survive today."

Most, if not all steam locomotives that had streamlining applied really only benefitted from it cosmetically. It provided very little improvement in fuel efficiency and performance, unlike diesels or electric locomotives that were streamlined."

MachinePorn,3848wt,numberjonnyfive,69,Mon Jun 1 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, its used primarily for seismic exploration. Geophones are strung out in an array trailing the ship (kind of how fishing lines are outrigged on a fishing boat) and the wide back portion allows for a wider spread of geophones. Wider spread means more geophones can be deployed at once which means more data can be gathered at once.  Such a weird looking vessel though!"

MachinePorn,3848wt,satisfyinghump,15,Tue Jun 2 01:13:37 2015 UTC,"These things tow up to 24 cables that are 50+ meters apart.  They have Barovanes that they tow from the sides of the ship.  As the vanes are pulled through the water they pull out away from the boat to the side.  They can only do so much and tow so much weight.  The wider ship allows for more cables (cables are approx 2-3"" in diameter and pretty darn heavy in the water and up to 12 kilometers long) to be lined up side by side and strung out to the vanes.  All in all you're looking at a spread of parallel cables being towed through the water at a max of ~12km wide and 12km long."

They didn't make the equipment too weak to hold up under the strain of going faster than they do just because they can't process the data properly if they go faster.

They can make the stuff stronger but that would make it physically larger and make it all cavitate more.  They can make it smaller and more streamlined but then that reduces strength.  There's always a push for new methods and materials to improve this.    This is all a bit moot at the moment though because as I was just reminded by a coworker the air guns that do the booming are usually a main limiting factor in all of this as well.  Their chambers range in size from 40-400 cubic inches (400 is pretty damn rare though, they usually top out at 300) and there are 30 or more of the things in the water.  They have to fill to 2000 psi for every shot (from large air compressors on board the ship passing through a  large umbilical line that they're towed with).  Shots are taken over distance, not time, so if you go too fast they can't fill up with air quickly enough before you pass over the next shotpoint."
MachinePorn,3848wt,miked1be,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"I see, thanks for the insight!   and make it all cavitate more   There's cavitation on hardware being towed at 5 knots?!"
MachinePorn,3848wt,ozzimark,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"No, but power and streamer spread is. You want as many cables as possible in a wide spread so you can cover an area as efficiently as possible, because the laws of physics stop you from towing cables that are several kilometers long through water very fast.  Hence the odd shape and gobs of power onboard."
MachinePorn,3848wt,wartzilla,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:18:30 2015 UTC,Why couldn't you have booms off the side like a shrimp boat or put planers on the lines so they spread out on their own?
MachinePorn,3848wt,99drumdude,3,Tue Jun 2 04:58:05 2015 UTC,"Each cable can have 4000+ lbs of force on them and this thing can tow 24 cables, boom wouldn't be strong enough.  These instruments are very sensitive and planers would probably create too much noise because of cavitation and such.  They do everything they can to tow as wide as possible but with as little in water noise as possible."
MachinePorn,3848wt,miked1be,2,Tue Jun 2 06:11:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting. How far behind the ship do they tow these things, do you know?"
MachinePorn,3848wt,99drumdude,2,Tue Jun 2 14:24:22 2015 UTC,http://www.pgs.com/upload/292879/spread_compared.jpg
MachinePorn,3848wt,wartzilla,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"Depends on the size of the boat.  On smaller ships the guns could be just under a hundred meters back, larger ones could have them 400+ meters behind the ship.  The active parts of the cables behind the ship will usually start just behind where the guns are towed."

MachinePorn,3848wt,miked1be,21,Mon Jun 1 21:52:16 2015 UTC,"I've been on this ship.  The it tows a set of cables pulled out to the sides by Barovanes that as they're towed through the water pull out to the side away from the ship, this creates a very wide tow point.  The cables contain hydrophones that are basically ultra sensitive microphones spaced throughout them, they're also filled with electronics, cabling, and load bearing ropes and are either a solid plastic or gel filled.  IIRC this boat has a 24 cable wide max that can all be up to 12 kilometers long.  All cables are generally parallel or as close as you can get to that and 50+ meters apart and towed at a certain depth underwater (usually something like 7-10 meters down).  They use high pressure air chambers towed directly behind the boat that pressurize to 2000 psi and release all at once creating an explosion like sound and the hyrdophones pick up the reflections from under the sea floor and they're able to stitch all of the recorded data together.  People that are far more educated than me put all of that together and can map out what's under the sea floor.  I'm just a tech.    The people that ride these things that actually work on the seismic equipment generally work 5-6 weeks at a time with 5-6 weeks off.  The maritime crew that takes care of the actual ship have varying ride times.    It gets dull at times being on a ship for that long but ones this nice usually have a gym on board along with good movie libraries and decent food.  The main problem is that internet speeds are sometimes laughable, you can generally check email and sometimes view photos and such but any videos or higher bandwidth stuff is pretty much out of the question."

MachinePorn,37x5mr,DjAngleGrinder07,3,Sun May 31 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"The only sources supporting MS that are even close to being legitimate are Seascanner and Wikipedia but they are hardly reliable sources. Your not being a dick but your source is not a source, its a claim with nothing to back it up. Cunard, the company that owns the Queen Victoria (originally owned by Carnival) does not document or refer to the ship as MV or MS publicly. And by publicly I mean it is not on their website.   Seascanner Wikipedia   It also doesn't even matter what you call it because MS and MV mean the same exact thing. Motor ship and motor vessel. They are both prefixes of the same meaning to indicate what kind of ship it is. Here is a list of prefixes and what they mean for those interested.  Seeing as some youtube videos, wikipedia, seascanner, and other various websites use the MS prefix, there is definitely something somewhere that once indicated it as such. Even if its just an error created by the internet, MS and MV mean the same thing - and if there is some deeply hidden difference between the two, Cunard does not bother using the prefix. So it doesn't matter. Its the Queen Victoria and the prefix makes no difference."
MachinePorn,37x5mr,magew,1 point,Sun May 31 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"Alright good response, well written. Couple of points: cunard are still owned by carnival.   More importantly, it's fair enough to say that my source in not a source, I'm not backing it up with anything but I will say that whenever we fill out documentation for those ships (oil records, disposal records bunker reports, the list is endless) we always write it as mv. That's the official designation from flag state and to port state. The only other one is the Queen Mary 2 which still has RMS.   Again not being a dick."

MachinePorn,37ri1x,HAL-42b,1 point,Fri May 29 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"Ok this is really the specialty of /r/steamporn but let me try to describe what I see.   This appears to be a cross-compund, drop valve engine driving a high pressure water pump. Probably used to feed water to a small town or a big factory.    You can see one running here   The steam is expanded twice. Once in the small cylinder at the back, then once more in the big cylinder in the front.   The drop valves were developed rather late in the history of steam and they led to the development of the poppet valves used in internal combustion engines. There are eight poppet valves, four for each cylinder. We can't see the exaust valves because they are at the bottom.   They appear to have a variable valve timing on the smaller cylinder judging by the complexity of the push-rod mechanism. The bigger cylinder is fed from the exhaust steam of the first cylinder   The water pump consists of the four upright cylinders at the back.   The pumping pistons are actually quite small compared to the overall size of the thing and are positioned horizontally so they could be driven directly by the piston rods. The big bulbous parts are pressure accumulators which serve to smooth out the flow of the water and thus conserve energy.   The crank case and the crosshead housing are semi-enclosed which is historically significant because it shows the transition from completely open crank cases to closed ones. The difference is in the oiling. Open engines including this one had drip oilers or oil wicks. These deliver constant small quantities of oil to the moving parts. Once used the oil is discarded hence total loss lubrication. This is not enough for running at high speeds so the machines using these are big and slow.  The first closed crank cases with oil pump recirculation were developed for the Willans High Speed Steam Engines This is another key development that led to the modern internal combustion engines."

MachinePorn,37qux9,RyanSmith,28,Fri May 29 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"I love stuff like this, I used to test octane levels in gasoline and the standard testing method required the use of an ASTM standard knock-testing engine. A single cylinder variable compression engine that you wound down the cylinder head until the engine started preignition (knocking) with a specific fuel, by bracketing known octane fuels with the fuel under test you could determine the octane of the test fuel.  Big ""knockmeter"" mounted above the engine. Those test engines, which I bet are used to this day, were all built to exacting design based on an early 20th century standard testing engine. Even when de-coking, this was done with ASTM standard ground walnut shells blown into the cylinder head.  This engine room and dyno rig immediately reminded me of our octane lab."
MachinePorn,37qux9,fiercelyfriendly,3,Fri May 29 19:11:07 2015 UTC,"I got to test one of those engines in college in our engines lab.  Neat setup.  Also, I'm actually building a test cell like this for my company.  A 200hp eddy current dyno and a 1500hp water brake.  Meant for testing diesel engines."
MachinePorn,37qux9,Bloodysneeze,3,Sat May 30 03:37:18 2015 UTC,There's a video of one such engine running at the bottom of this page: http://www.intertek.com/petroleum/testing/octane/
MachinePorn,37qux9,Dimensional_Shambler,3,Sat May 30 17:38:40 2015 UTC,"Well found sir, that was a blast from the past. Almost identical to the engines I was working from '76 to 80 ! We had a lab rota as to who was doing ""octanes"" any particular shift. Came round about every 6 shifts. Nothing like a long night shift with a trolley full of samples to run. The only difference, we had a manual handle to wind down the cylinder head, these are motorised. The motor conversion was available back then, but we had the manual ones, you got a more hands on feel for the engine cranking the head down onto knock. Happy days!"
MachinePorn,37qux9,fiercelyfriendly,2,Sat May 30 17:52:20 2015 UTC,"That sounds really interesting! So the combustion chamber volume is variable? Neat! So as the volume is reduced, the compression ratio increases until knock, right? Was there a sensor used to determine the point of pre-ignition or was this just done by ear (or perhaps with a mic and headset)?"
MachinePorn,37qux9,fiercelyfriendly,3,Sun May 31 02:04:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly as you describe. The engine has four fuel chambers for reference fuels and the fuel under test which are selectable so if you are testing a 98 octane blend you would bracket with 100 and 96. Then, after determining if it was above or below 98, if I remember right you would narrower bracket the reference fuels ie 98 and 99. Keep the head wound  down the same position once set. The sensor on the head I think was essentially a contact microphone. The aim was to get readings for each reference fuel and have the test fuel fall on the scale on the meter between the two. It's nearly 35 years since I did Octane tests so I can't remember the exact specifics, but it was quite a lengthy process to get an exact number to one decimal, ie 98.4.  The engine knock sound was so distinctive that initial set up you barely needed the knock meter to get the compression right.  The carburettor bowls had cooling jackets to stop volatile fuel components flashing off and altering the results.  I'm pretty sure the octane of the batch of fuel in your car today was tested using this method."

MachinePorn,37lb8h,pizzaanarchy,7,Thu May 28 22:40:27 2015 UTC,"Serious question, something I've never understood.   There is propeller at one end of the shaft, what is on the opposite end? And as the prop turns it creates thrust, how does that physically translate into forward motion for the boat? Is there a bearing or similar that the prop shaft pushes against, thus pushing the boat forward?  Hope this isn't a dumb, dumb question. I understand that an outboard, for instance, hangs off the back of the boat. The prop turns which pushes the entire motor forward (or backwards) which translates to force on the transom which moves the boat forward. When you change that thrust to an inboard / shaft drive how does that thrust ultimately translate into forward motion for the vessel?  thanks!"
MachinePorn,37lb8h,gnartung,13,Thu May 28 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"There is a thrust bearing at the ""other end"", and normal bearings along the shaft.  As might be expected, hard reversing is frowned upon as it tends to damage all of the bearings as well as the packings.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_bearing"
MachinePorn,37lb8h,8979323,9,Thu May 28 17:34:19 2015 UTC,"Okay.  I could be misinterpreting your question, but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you're asking  how the force generated by the propeller, and transmitted into the propshaft, is ultimately transmitted to the hull.  If that is correct, then the answer is pretty simple from my limited understanding.  A thrust bearing is the usual culprit.  In ships I've seen them diagrammed like this.  On the end of the propshaft is generally a reduction gear or direct connection to the engine.  I believe the thrust bearing could be located in any number of places along the propshaft though.  In this simplified diagram its actually on the far side of the reduction gearing.  In this one you can see that it is in what I believe to be a more traditional location between the engine/gearing and the propeller.  That diagram also gives a little explanation as to what purpose the thrust bearing serves.  As mentioned, I know very little about this topic but I do believe most of what I said is roughly accurate.  Hope that helps."
MachinePorn,37lb8h,Titus142,7,Thu May 28 17:52:27 2015 UTC,Look up thrust block and thrust bearing for some information. Fluid bearings seem to be the preferred solution. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_bearing#Michell.2FKingsbury_tilting-pad_fluid_bearings
MachinePorn,37lb8h,QuantumRiff,2,Thu May 28 17:35:50 2015 UTC,The shaft has a thrust bearing which transfers that forward motion to the hull of the ship. without it the shaft would just push forward through the ship. The rest of the shaft is supported by regular bearing then ending at some kind of main reduction gear (like a transmission of sorts) which connects to the engine of your choice. The thrust bearings are usually located close to the back of the ship with the rest of the shaft extending forward.
MachinePorn,37lb8h,Titus142,4,Fri May 29 03:14:12 2015 UTC,What is with the plastic wrap? are they afraid it will get wet? :)
MachinePorn,37lb8h,annoyedatwork,8,Thu May 28 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"Ha. Actually I think it serves a purpose. This ship has a hydraulically controlled pitch propeller. I don't really know how those work but it's got to consist of some sort of hollow drive shaft and special mounts where each blade connects to a rotating base. Anyway, I think they probably wrap it up to protect the hydraulic system from moisture and/or catch whatever hydraulic fluid may leak out during this crane exercise."
MachinePorn,37lb8h,MacaRat,4,Thu May 28 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"CRP, controllable reversible pitch. You got it right, the shaft has chambers that allow hydraulic fluid to be pumped in which rotates each blade. Also allows for reversing thrust without changing shaft rotation."

MachinePorn,377mp9,inqrorken,30,Mon May 25 16:32:00 2015 UTC,"My obvious bias aside, the photo is a good example of how infrastructure is sited. For any coal station, you have to balance between siting near mines (transport can be half the cost of coal, in the States), siting near load centers or at least very high voltage transmission lines (500 kV+; U.S. average transmission loss is 7%), and siting near water for cooling.  From OP's photo, it's very easy to see that fuel transportation costs win this round. That said, the mine site appears to be within 30 mi of Cologne and 20 mi of Duesseldorf, so the company(ies) shouldn't be taking too much of a line-loss hit.  For those interested, the left-most (most northerly) plant appears to have two medium-size units and 12-14 small units. The central plant has 4-5 medium-size units.

MachinePorn,377mp9,inqrorken,5,Mon May 25 18:30:27 2015 UTC,very cool addition of information.  Interesting to say the least.
MachinePorn,377mp9,toomuchtodotoday,7,Mon May 25 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"You forgot the part where Germany gets ~30% of its power from solar and wind, and its only going up.   While peak-generation from combined wind and solar reached a new all-time high of 74% in April 2014,[4] wind power saw its best day ever on December 12, 2014, generating 562 GWh.[5] Germany has been called ""the world's first major renewable energy economy"".[6][7]   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Germany  A nuclear power plant takes at least 10 years and $1 billion USD to come online. Solar and wind generation sites come online in months. Nuclear didn't die because its a bad technology; it died because humans suck at using it properly."
MachinePorn,377mp9,xxJohnxx,17,Mon May 25 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"The big problem with renewable energy, especially in Germany, is the uncontrollability of the whole renewable power production, especially solar power.   German Energy providers are starting to struggle more and more to control the decentralized power production.  25 years ago, coal and nuclear plants supplied the base load while pump-storage water power plants (pumping in the night, and producing power during peak loads) as well as gas power plants would supply the peak power demands.   However, this completely changed in the recent years. While coal (and to a lesser extend nuclear) power plants still supply the base load, wind and solar power production cause fluctuations in power production. This often leaves Germany with excess power that they have to get rid off.  The only viable solution so far (besides exporting) are pump-storage water power plants. Their roll completely changed in the recent years.   They aren't exclusively pumping in the night anymore, but instead, they pump whenever there is excess energy. Pumping at noon, unimaginable 20 years ago, is a usual thing nowadays. All just to get the power grid under control.   If you are interested, take a look at the Kopswerk II or the currently under construction Obervermuntwerk II. Both of them are located in the Austrian Alps and are partially owned (and completely financed) by German power providers. Their only purpose is to operate as ""accumulators"" trying to store as much of the renewable energy as possible until it is needed again.  The energy losses are quit big though (which is even desired in some operation modes of those plants).  Green energy is the way to go, but it still brings a lot of difficulties that have to be solved first, with it."
MachinePorn,377mp9,inqrorken,9,Mon May 25 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to explain the importance of a stable electric grid to Westerners - we've been very spoiled in that regard. For now, German companies have been eating those costs, along with the ridiculously high base rates. I don't think it's sustainable in the long term, unless Elon Musk actually invents a new type of battery."
MachinePorn,377mp9,xxJohnxx,2,Mon May 25 20:37:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, very true. The power supply grid works to well for people to really understand how difficult it is to maintain it.   But electrical power is also too cheap to really get people worrying about it. Paying less than 100€/month for electricity lets you forget about the effort behind power production.   Not too sure about the long term sustainability. The German state as well as the European government is funding the power providers, to allow the move towards renewable energy (and even more importantly, away from nuclear power). The people have their minds set, as well as does the government. There is no real way back.  This lead to a interesting change in the market. Germany subsidizes coal power plants to such a high extend, that nuclear power currently isn't viable, and a lot of nuclear power plants cost more than they gather revenue.   For example the nuclear power plants in Switzerland are currently only still running at full power because it would cost even more temporarily shut them off until the prices normalize again."

MachinePorn,377mp9,MCvarial,3,Mon May 25 20:32:42 2015 UTC,"Utility scale batteries are usually used for very short term grid balancing, not to fix the long term variability problem. Pumped storage would be a better option for this, however the combination of renewables + storage is an extremely expensive one which won't be deployable on a large scale any time soon. The nuclear waste is far more easy to deal with, we already have geological repositories."
MachinePorn,377mp9,xxJohnxx,2,Tue May 26 09:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are solutions for the problems.   Another approach is to adjust the demand instead of the production.  A lot of research is done towards the so called ""Smart Grid"".  The basic idea is that certain consumers (dishwashers, washing machines, heating as well as eventually charging and discharging electric cars, ...) in households are only turned on when the power production allows it (similar to current electric warm water heaters).   While this is not the best solution, as the consumers will lose a bit of comfort, it is a solution that is currently technically possible.   It will be very interesting to see what future will bring us though and how the problems will be solved."
MachinePorn,377mp9,HB0404,1 point,Mon May 25 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"Genuine question for you that might shed some light on why you think nuclear energy is something to be rid of.   Years down the road when fusion becomes possible on a commercial scale, will your opinion change?  At that point nuclear would probably be the best option in most cases as the fuel would be hydrogen isotopes and the output would be harmless helium.  And since I feel like you'll try to say that fusion won't happen anytime soon,  just play along with me for a bit and assume it will.  What'll be your view on nuclear then.  Also as a side note, what are your thoughts on thorium reactors?  They're much safer than light water reactors in general."

You seem to have chosen $1B because it sounds suitably large; the actual number is larger still. Recent estimates for Vogtle 3 & 4 are a total of about $7B for the project, or $3.5B per unit.   I picked $1B to be conservative. Vogtle 3 & 4 have been under construction since 2013, and won't be generating power until at least 2023. By then, they won't be able to compete with renewables per kwh.  Your data doesn't take into account that nuclear power plants have limited liability, with the remainder of said liability saddled onto our government. [1]    The Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act (commonly called the Price-Anderson Act) is a United States federal law, first passed in 1957 and since renewed several times, which governs liability-related issues for all non-military nuclear facilities constructed in the United States before 2026. The main purpose of the Act is to partially indemnify the nuclear industry against liability claims arising from nuclear incidents while still ensuring compensation coverage for the general public. The Act establishes a no fault insurance-type system in which the first approximately $12.6 billion (as of 2011) is industry-funded as described in the Act. Any claims above the $12.6 billion would be covered by a Congressional mandate to retroactively increase nuclear utility liability or would be covered by the federal government. At the time of the Act's passing, it was considered necessary as an incentive for the private production of nuclear power — this was because electric utilities viewed the available liability coverage (only $60 million) as inadequate.   The costs with cleanup at Fukushima are already at $105 billion USD. This does not account for the fact that the technology does not currently exist to contain the failed reactor cores and their ever-leaking waste. [2]   The tragedy at the Fukushima nuclear plant will cost 11.08 trillion yen ($105 billion), twice as much as Japanese authorities predicted at the end of 2011, says the study. The expenses include radiation clean-up and compensation to residents.   Nor does your data account for the vast amounts of nuclear waste currently in temporary storage, with no prospects for reprocessing or long-term safe storage. [3]   Nuclear materials generate high level waste that is extremely hazardous and capable of harming living organisms and the environment. While low and intermediate level radioactive wastes are being appropriately disposed, high level radioactive waste is still stored at temporary locations awaiting disposal at permanent facilities. [8] And still, there are no permanent facilities, even though approximately 270,000 metric tons of high level radioactive waste has accumulated in 30 countries and an additional 9,000 metric tons are being added annually. [8] Despite being in the title of this paper, high level nuclear waste ""disposal"" is a misnomer. [5] Even the strongest promoters of nuclear energy will not claim that ultimate disposal methods are yet achievable. Any idea conceived will have to solve problems regarding storage, guardianship, and management of the waste. [5] Without a known solution to the nuclear energy waste problem, and with continued electricity production from reactors, high level waste will continue to build up around the world. And as debates over this controversial issue continue, the waste will patiently decay as its gets passed from generation to generation for hundreds of thousands of years.   But hey! Fuck it! Let's not include externalities in our data, they don't exist, am I right? What next? Not accounting for the vast amounts of CO2 and radium pumped into the atmosphere by coal power plants?

Nor does your data account for the vast amounts of nuclear waste currently in temporary storage, with no prospects for reprocessing or long-term safe storage.   Actually, it does, for the U.S.'s numbers. The nuclear waste storage fund is paid for per kWh by ratepayers, which is then passed to the Federal government. The nuclear utilities began suing the Federal government for that money, as the utilities themselves were storing the waste - against the agreement."

MachinePorn,374d69,zx80r,5,Sun May 24 22:45:16 2015 UTC,"There is a BOV just before the throttle, under the blue fitting. Maybe its use as a pop off for overboost protection or as an emergency shut down?"
MachinePorn,374d69,WinfieldBlues_25s,4,Mon May 25 03:01:31 2015 UTC,I'm thinking that's their way of controlling boost pressure to keep the turbo from going into surge while spooling. The dual vacuum lines suggest they control the pressure to each side of the diaphragm.
MachinePorn,374d69,Jake-,3,Mon May 25 03:33:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, they use the boost pressure to help keep it closed giving much better control at high and rapidly changing boost pressures. Takes away most of the 'creep' that often happens with wear and intense heat.  You really don't want a surge condition happening on something like that."
MachinePorn,374d69,BlackholeZ32,4,Mon May 25 04:45:18 2015 UTC,Theres also the fact that the top end boost controllers do things like provide specific boost at a given wheel speed... This means you can set the controller up to provide exactly the right amount of torque to enable a small %age of wheel spin - meaning that the engine makes exactly the right amount of torque for that track on that day. Purely gating the turbine would not give the required granularity of control required for that sort of function.
MachinePorn,374d69,mck1117,1 point,Mon May 25 16:13:20 2015 UTC,That would make sense. Didn't spot the BOV by the throttle body. nice catch

MachinePorn,374d69,BlackholeZ32,1 point,Mon May 25 00:58:47 2015 UTC,No intercooler I can see.  Probably meth injected instead of intercooled.

MachinePorn,374d69,BlackholeZ32,1 point,Mon May 25 02:20:28 2015 UTC,It's got  a water to air intercooler in the intake most likely.
MachinePorn,374d69,ross340,0,Mon May 25 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. Running on alcohol, it runs cold and with lots and lots of octane. In fact if you leave it idle for over a few minutes, the intake manifold will get frost on it. As for using a wastegate for a blow off valve, I'm still trying to figure that out"
MachinePorn,374d69,ke7ofi,0,Mon May 25 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, and that's not a wastegate."
MachinePorn,374d69,fire_n_ice,0,Mon May 25 16:28:29 2015 UTC,No. It doesn't. There is no intercooler or radiator on an alcohol powered pro mod. And it's most definitely a wastegate. Learn something instead of arguing with people. http://www.streettunedmotorsports.com/parts/pte_pw46_wastegate.htm

MachinePorn,36v534,ion-tom,4,Fri May 22 14:34:03 2015 UTC,Could planes launch from that carrier??? It's so small
MachinePorn,36v534,QuickSpore,13,Fri May 22 17:08:04 2015 UTC,"That's an Essex class carrier, with a flight deck 888 feet long. They were the big US carriers in WWII. Planes could and did operate from much smaller carriers. The Bogue class carriers for example had flight decks that were only 439 feet long."
MachinePorn,36v534,ion-tom,4,Fri May 22 17:30:14 2015 UTC,"It's probably just the number of planes on top that make it look unlaunchable. I'm sure they had ""slingers"" - not sure on technical term sorry."
MachinePorn,36v534,Beerificus,3,Fri May 22 17:41:52 2015 UTC,"Catapults? Some did, most did not. Planes then had more power-to-weight ratio advantage & could take off from a pretty short runway (about half the deck length)."
MachinePorn,36v534,vonHindenburg,10,Fri May 22 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"It wasn't so much power to weight as takeoff speed.  They needed a lot less space to get up a high enough speed than does an F18, not because of power to weight ratios, but because they just need less time to accelerate to their lower launching speed."
MachinePorn,36v534,Beerificus,1 point,Fri May 22 19:54:08 2015 UTC,P-to-W is a bad way to describe it...   lower take off speed! :)
MachinePorn,36v534,QuickSpore,3,Fri May 22 23:48:47 2015 UTC,"As /u/Beerficus says some of them had catapults others didn't.  Here is a picture of the USS Essex actively launching planes. This is taken later after they started carrying jets. As you can see there are two planes in the catapults prepping for takeoff. There are a couple more prepping to go into the catapults. And then there are a number more getting ready to be moved into the prep area.  In the pre-jet period, the launch area would account for the length of the deck of a smaller carrier, while the prep area would be located to the side. On a longer carrier, like the Essex class, about the forward 2/3rds of the deck would be reserved for takeoff and the back 1/3rd could be used for prep.  One disadvantage of a setup like this is that carriers couldn't takeoff and land planes simultaneously. Normally it wasn't an issue as most of the planes would be launched or landed as a group. But it could cause issues in extended battles where multiple strikes had to be flown. Timing launches, landings, refueling and rearming could make the decks very chaotic.  Modern carriers tend to launch much fewer planes at a time. And can launch and land planes simultaneously."
MachinePorn,36v534,Beerificus,3,Fri May 22 23:00:20 2015 UTC,"Great breakdown! As it looks in the pic you linked, if you had some mechanical problems & had to land immediately, then you just ditch the plane? I guess that's the way it was then. I'd imagine that with so many carriers post-WWII, there was a lot of development in how they handled the deck."
MachinePorn,36v534,tobascodagama,2,Fri May 22 23:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the deck would look pretty different during flight ops, I imagine."

The engines of the CH-53E spin at 10's of thousands of rpm (I forget the exact number), but is reduced to less than 200 rpm at the main rotor head.

MachinePorn,36oxwo,voucher420,4,Fri May 22 02:30:41 2015 UTC,Can someone explain how it goes back? How does it oscillate?
MachinePorn,36oxwo,Harlequin12,2,Thu May 21 12:29:18 2015 UTC,"The one in the photo doesn't go back'n'forth -- it spins in only one direction. The ones that change directions have a mechanism on the bottom that catches on stationary stops attached to the base of the sprinkler, the stops flip a toggle on the sprinkler head that limits the travel of the arm, which changes the balance of forces in the arm (the bit that 'bouncs' off of the jet of water) oscillation so that the primary direction of the force changes direction.  Let me try that again. In normal operation, the sprinkler is driven 'round by the force of the 'arm' returning and hitting a hard stop, the sprinkler head is basically tapped around (tap tap tap). To rotate in the opposite direction, the arm travel is limited, so that the jet of water spends more time being deflected by the arm, and because of the limited travel, the tapping force becomes quite small. The force caused by the jet being deflected is what pushes the head around in this mode."
MachinePorn,36oxwo,linotype,2,Thu May 21 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"And those stops are the Achilles Heel of the assembly. If that mechanism breaks or the stop goes MIA for any reason, that head is scrap.  That's why you see popup sprinklers like Hunter's PGP or static misting heads operating.  The impact models are more common in areas where large fields need better coverage, like golf courses or athletic fields."

I admit that it doesn't seem at first glance to be able to land with that extra mass in the rear, but it does: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z37FXs3OCE"
MachinePorn,36hnml,MrWizard45,5,Tue May 19 16:54:41 2015 UTC,I like how it just barely generates enough lift to land safely. I guess with no people aboard you don't have to worry about damaging squishy bits.
MachinePorn,36hnml,irritatingrobot,8,Tue May 19 14:59:14 2015 UTC,"The Shuttle didn’t glide particularly well, either. It had a glide ratio of 4.5:1 at landing."
MachinePorn,36hnml,SenorPuff,11,Tue May 19 15:07:42 2015 UTC,"To put that in perspective, an unpowered 767 has a glide ratio of 12:1, and the best gliders push 60:1"
MachinePorn,36hnml,ltjpunk387,3,Tue May 19 16:28:43 2015 UTC,"It glided significantly better than it had to, since it was designed to be able to do a single orbit over the pole and then land in the continental US. Since the Air Force pulled out of the Shuttle program after the challenger this capability was never used but the fact that it was a design requirement meant that the shuttle's wings are significantly larger than they needed to be for their normal mission profile.  During re-entry from a normal mission the shuttle would make a couple of big turns to bleed off excess energy and avoid overshooting the runway on approach."
MachinePorn,36hnml,BrowsOfSteel,1 point,Tue May 19 17:38:31 2015 UTC,"I thought the shuttle actually went past and turned around, to be safe, so final approach was done over water."
MachinePorn,36hnml,MrGrazam,2,Tue May 19 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"Many shuttles were landed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, so focal approach was over water. They did not have to turn around. When shuttles land in Florida, final approach it's over land."

MachinePorn,36hnml,encaseme,1 point,Wed May 20 01:42:53 2015 UTC,It wouldn't have much speed that it needs to bleed off for landing being dropped from that height so it doesn't flair up like a passenger jet which is really heavy and needs to be travelling fast to maintain altitude. Also it doesn't matter how hard the brakes are are applied or how hard the landing is as no passengers to worry about booking more flights for more money. I'm assuming you're comparing to a passenger plane landing.
MachinePorn,36hnml,MrWizard45,1 point,Wed May 20 02:20:51 2015 UTC,Why are the guys inspecting it wearing space suits?  Are they afraid it might be emitting some toxic vapors after landing or something?
MachinePorn,36hnml,TheRighteousTyrant,5,Wed May 20 02:22:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know specifically for this situation, but some fuels used for spaceflight are very very hazardous for humans. They could be dealing with that."
MachinePorn,36hnml,rzNicad,7,Tue May 19 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's fueled by hydrazine which is highly toxic and dangerously unstable."
MachinePorn,36hnml,AndrewCarnage,2,Tue May 19 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"We also don't want to send microorganisms out into space, it risks screwing up our search for extraterrestrial life."
MachinePorn,36hnml,TheRighteousTyrant,6,Tue May 19 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"In addition to what other people are saying about it just having landed, in any situation where an area is being kept clean, there is usually a pressure differential. The clean area is kept at a higher pressure to keep the area clean in the event of a leak.  If you look closely, these suits are inflated like balloons, indicating they are meant to protect the workers, not the equipment.    E: I know that the point has been made, I'm just adding in interesting information ^_^"
MachinePorn,36hnml,AndrewCarnage,1 point,Tue May 19 17:42:37 2015 UTC,"Right, but I think they're inspecting a vehicle which just landed so they're probably not too worried about contaminating it."

MachinePorn,36hnml,ckopoct,1 point,Wed May 20 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, many people mentioned the toxicity of the fuel and that makes sense to me.  I just don't think they'd be worried about contaminating a spaceship that just landed.  It's on earth.  It's gonna get contaminated.  A lot.  There's all kinds of gross biological stuff going on all over the place around here.  You clean it up and make it sterile right before you launch, I think."

MachinePorn,36hnml,diachi,2,Tue May 19 21:21:34 2015 UTC,what are the metal plates for? and what do the cups forms for?
MachinePorn,36hnml,Richardmg9,11,Wed May 20 04:40:48 2015 UTC,"The fairing visible is an Atlas V five-metre payload fairing, which has a structure made from sandwich panels with carbon fiber face sheets and a vented aluminum honeycomb core. The cup-like structures on the plates are in fact acoustics absorbers, part of the fairing acoustic protection (FAP) system which lines the interior of the fairing. The FAP actually serves to protect the payload by dampening the sound created by the rocket during liftoff and ascent into the atmosphere.  The plates themselves just hold the acoustic absorbers - but they are not metal. They are actually made out of a foamed plastic mat, usually reticulated polyimide. They are only covered in a thin protective foil of polyester, which just prevents the penetration of particles.  Here's a better view of the FAP on the payload fairings that were on the Atlas V that launched Curiosity into space.

MachinePorn,36b7fm,Hansafan,2,Mon May 18 12:10:57 2015 UTC,I was thrown off by the fact that Icelanders purchased a lot of equipment from Russia in the 90's (it was dirt cheap).
MachinePorn,36b7fm,HAL-42b,5,Mon May 18 10:33:35 2015 UTC,"Looking at the 80's and further back, there were Lada cars and a few UAZ in the 80's, so Iceland did in fact buy some equipment from the eastern bloc, but those were usually not from Russia-proper when it came to construction and agricultural machinery. — From the top of my head, Zetor tractors from Czechoslovakia were quite common, but raw materials and some consumer products were more commonly imported from the eastern bloc in exchange for herring.  Heavy-duty machinery were mostly western (West-German, British and American for the most part), at least for those who could afford it.  Old tracktors from International Harvester (Farmall) still have an fanbase in the country and it's not uncommon to see a restored one in the front of a farmhouse in Iceland."
MachinePorn,36b7fm,stebbiv,1 point,Mon May 18 11:01:38 2015 UTC,I'm not really familiar with Eastern bloc tractors (which is odd considering I grew up there). This is the first time I hear about Zetor. Judging by pictures of older models they seem to be sturdy little bastards. If the quality of Zetor is anywhere near TOS (The renowned Czech industrial machine builders) they must be very high quality machines indeed.
MachinePorn,36b7fm,HAL-42b,1 point,Mon May 18 11:21:23 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, Lada(didn't think of cars as this topic is about heavy-duty equipment) and Zetor are some of the east bloc brands that actually got anywhere in northern/western Europe. There used to be a good number of Lada cars here in Norway too.  Funnily enough, International never became a ""thing"" here. Then again, I'm not a farmer, but Cat, John Deere and Massey-Ferguson seem to be the big ones. They're the ones you see here, at least."

MachinePorn,363s4u,skftw,6,Fri May 15 22:01:17 2015 UTC,"Which one is more efficient, 2L 4Cylinder or 2L 8Cylinder? In other words, what is the relationship between the number of cylinders and efficiency?"
MachinePorn,363s4u,bigcrab,9,Sat May 16 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"The 4 cylinder is more fuel efficient. There are less parts and far less friction.   However, the V8 allows for tiny pistons. Tiny pistons means you have less mass flinging around at the end of the rods so you can achieve higher RPM and therefore generally higher horsepower. You also have 32 valves instead of 16 allowing it to breathe better.   You could say that the 8 cylinder is more efficient at making power from displacement. Efficiency can mean different things depending on which aspects of the engine you're measuring.  Before anyone rips me apart for this explanation, understand that it's extremely simplified and the actual explanation involves reading several textbooks from cover to cover."
MachinePorn,363s4u,TheScriptKiddie,4,Sat May 16 03:10:00 2015 UTC,"Good question, I know when Ford switched from the 460v8 to a v10 one of the reasons was better emissions, get a more complete burn from smaller cylinder"
MachinePorn,363s4u,TomShoe,3,Sat May 16 06:22:24 2015 UTC,"I wonder if that gets canceled out by increased friction when you scale it down, since a 2 liter I4 already has much smaller cylinders than a 460 V8. Supposedly 0.5 liters per cylinder is the magic number."
MachinePorn,363s4u,skftw,2,Sat May 16 03:13:37 2015 UTC,"It's not just about 0.5 litres though, it's about a certain bore-stroke ratio.  Also, this mostly has to do with the distribution of fuel throughout the cylinder, which can be achieved in larger capacity cylinders through clever injection methods and valve placement."
MachinePorn,363s4u,irritatingrobot,1 point,Sat May 16 06:17:36 2015 UTC,"The 460 is a very very old engine. It's an all-iron pushrod engine developed decades ago and adapted time and time again to meet modern emissions standards. It's not a bad engine at all; people can make a TON of power out of them as I'm sure you know. But, the entire engine was designed before computer simulations existed, before aluminum heads were cheap, etc etc.  As for the 6.8 being a V10 instead of a V8? I don't have a solid reason for you, but there are a few possibilities. It may share pistons, valves, and other parts with the 5.4 V8 due to similar displacement per cylinder, it probably burns cleaner with the smaller combustion chambers (vs a 6.8 V8), having less mass per piston it may have a differently shaped powerband more suited to towing heavy loads at high speeds."

MachinePorn,363s4u,skftw,4,Sat May 16 05:04:13 2015 UTC,That and this was a grand prix engine apparently so it was modified from the road going 2.6 to fit an engine size category and to improve the red line that it will rev to.
MachinePorn,363s4u,TheHairlessGorilla,3,Sat May 16 07:22:52 2015 UTC,"Other way around actually. The original engine was a 2.0 litre racing version used in prototype racing with the original Tipo 33. To the best of my understanding, it was never used in Grand Prix racing, as Alfa weren't involved in Formula 1 at the time of it's design, and by the time they reentered the series, their V8, even in it's more powerful later forms, couldn't compete, meaning they relied on a powerful but complex Flat-12, which also powered the final Tipo 33 prototypes.   The 2.0 litre mill was used in the 33/1 and 33/2 variants, as well as the road going 33 Stradale, built for homologation purposes. It was designed with room for ""more meat on the bones"" however, and with the introduction of the Group 6 regulations, the engine was enlarged to 3.0 litres for the 33/3, which otherwise was pretty much totally unrelated to the previous iterations. I believe it was from this 3.0 litre unit that the 2.6 litre road going version found in the Alfa Romeo Montreal was based, as it was the version being raced at the time of the Montreal's introduction.  As you might be able to tell, I'm a bit of an Alfa fanboy."

So easy to work on, so easy to find/make upgrades, just a fun project waiting to be ripped apart and rebuilt."
MachinePorn,363s4u,markrages,2,Sat May 16 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"It certainly does have an appeal. What gets me is that most of them have that bolt-on mod appeal because they were so poorly/cheaply designed in the first place. Consider the Ford 305 and Chevy 350 V8s: you could gain a full, real 100HP+ from a pair of heads and a cam. That's awesome, but a similar era DOHC head from one of the Japanese manufacturers already flows nearly optimally; you might port/polish it, but there's almost no reason to outright replace the head.  The fact that the displacement is there waiting to be unlocked is great for modders. The imports need to rely on forced induction since so few of them have properly large engines. In contrast, the American muscle cars just needed bolt ons to hit the same power levels.  Guess it's all the same in the end, but I'd still prefer a high-tech engine to a brute-force one."
MachinePorn,363s4u,alfa75,3,Tue May 19 12:36:37 2015 UTC,"The thing for me is that this engine is from the start of the high tech era, it showed what was possible - more than 100bhp per litre. Now we can get that from any number of multi valve production engines.  In fact a lot of 16v engines are held back, if you consider that the Cos cast GM C20 engine made over 300bhp until they de-cammed it. A Honda  B16A will make a further 200bhp with TypeR cams swapped."

I think this map shows that the British turned, german double agent spies, had been relaying information to their german commanders that the v2 was always overshooting its target. As such the Germans aimed shorter in the British hope that they would bomb Kent instead of London. I think that's shown here by the higher density in East rather than west London."
MachinePorn,35yoih,dutch_londoner,8,Thu May 14 19:25:03 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:   An estimated 2,754 civilians were killed in London by V-2 attacks with another 6,523 injured,[39] which is two people killed per V-2 rocket. However, this understates the potential of the V-2, since many rockets were misdirected and exploded harmlessly. Accuracy increased over the course of the war, particularly on batteries where Leitstrahl-Guide Beam apparatus was installed.[40] Missile strikes that found targets could cause large numbers of deaths — 160 were killed and 108 seriously injured in one explosion at 12:26 pm on 25 November 1944, at a Woolworth's department store in New Cross, south-east London.[41]  After these deadly results, British intelligence leaked falsified information implying that the rockets were over-shooting their London target by 10 to 20 miles (16 to 32 km). This tactic worked, and for the remainder of the war most landed on less-heavily populated areas in Kent due to erroneous recalibration.[42]"

MachinePorn,35yoih,BCMM,22,Fri May 15 15:24:38 2015 UTC,"The V2 was the one that terrorised England and was a lot more powerful, and a lot faster.

MachinePorn,35yoih,Realworld,5,Thu May 14 21:04:02 2015 UTC,I believe it had a gyroscope inside. Though im not sure if that was used as a device to control its ailerons.
MachinePorn,35yoih,FEED_ME_YOUR_EYES,5,Thu May 14 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"It had a gyroscope inside to sense roll disturbances. It didn't have ailerons. My question was, without ailerons, how did it aerodynamically correct for roll disturbances? How did it roll back to level if it happened to tilt to one side?  Took a considerable amount of digging to find this report:   Another thing is the absence of ailerons. Obviously the guiding principle here was to cheapen and simplify the machine. What happens is something like this: the axis of the master gyro is elevated some 25 deg. To the horizontal in a vertical plane so that a roll appears to the auto-pilot as a reduced amount of yaw. Hence if the left wing should drop, it puts on the right rudder, steering to the right and giving a higher velocity over the left wing, thus raising it to the normal position.   I don't buy this 'higher velocity' theory; both wings are traveling at the same relative 400-500mph. More likely, despite no wing sweep and no dihedral, the mid-wing mounted position allows rudder yaw to blank out enough of the stub wing to decrease lift on the blanked out side, crudely and indirectly roll it in that direction, and thus back to level."
MachinePorn,35yoih,clee-saan,2,Fri May 15 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"I don't buy this 'higher velocity' theory   The writer of that article is not just guessing, this is an established principle and one of the first things you learn as a pilot. It's an immediate effect of the controls - when you hit the rudder pedal, one of the wings is pushed forward into the airflow (momentarily increasing its airspeed) and the other is brought back (reducing its airspeed). This immediate change in velocity is what causes the change in lift force on each wing. You might think the difference in velocity is not that great, but remember that lift and drag forces are proportional to the square of the velocity."
MachinePorn,35yoih,Realworld,1 point,Fri May 15 12:27:16 2015 UTC,"But if the V1 has to turn to correct for roll, once it's back horizontal, how does it go back to the correct heading? Wouldn't turning back to the correct heading induce roll in the other direction?"

Your ground school instructor mistaught you about yaw induced roll.  In a normal, properly designed fixed wing aircraft, rudder yaw directly causes sideslip, which indirectly causes roll through dihedral effect.  Less commonly, wing back sweep can also be used to for roll control."

The sub is being tested on its ability to duplicate the sometimes hazardous job United Space Alliance (USA) divers perform to recover the expended boosters in the ocean after a launch. The boosters splash down in an impact area about 140 miles east of Jacksonville and after recovery are towed back to KSC for refurbishment by the specially rigged recovery ships. DeepWorker 2000 will be used in a demonstration during retrieval operations after the upcoming STS-101 launch. The submarine pilot will demonstrate capabilities to cut tangled parachute riser lines using a manipulator arm and attach a Diver Operator Plug to extract water and provide flotation for the booster.

MachinePorn,35lpnc,Rainer3012,13,Mon May 11 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"Cheapest repair ever made to a ship:   Growler began her sea trials on 4 November 1958 in the traditional submarine test area off the Isle of Shoals. A successful first day was spent on the surface conducting full power runs, testing various ship systems and cycling all masts. At dawn on 5 November 1958, the Growler crew prepared to conduct the first test depth dive. After submerging to periscope depth, she then proceeded deeper, leveling off at 50 foot increments as the crew checked all systems and hull fittings subject to sea pressure. As Growler passed the fleet-type submarine test depth of 475 feet, the majority of her crew were in new territory, never having been this deep before. Everything was fine until Growler reached 75 feet short of her test depth. Radioman Leonard Powers was in the Radio Shack directly across the passage way from the Sonar Room. Powers remembers hearing a loud pop and looking across the passage way towards the source of the sound only to find a stream of water roaring down from an empty one-half inch cable fitting in the overhead of the Sonar Room. Captain Priest immediately ordered ""Emergency Surface"" while everyone nearby grabbed buckets and began collecting the water, passing it along to the galley for disposal. Most of the water was flowing into bilges or staying within the four- inch deck coaming that surrounded the Sonar Room. Unlike most of the crew's experience on the fleet-type submarines, where the compressed air rushed into the ballast tanks during an emergency surface evolution, at this much greater depth the air seemed to barely hiss. Lieutenant(jg) Robert Duke, the Communications Officer, was monitoring the depth gauge in the Chief Petty Officer's quarters and recalls the strange sensation of Growler slowly rising to the surface with a slight down angle due to the flooding. Growler surfaced with only superficial damage. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Planning Superintendent, Lieutenant Commander Hank Hoffman, went topside and determined that an unused cable fitting opening had been plugged with a temporary blank for dockside tests which had not been replaced prior to sea trials. With all the time lost and additional costs if they returned to port, Hoffman suggested to Captain Priest, Jr. that a solution was readily available on board. The cable hole was slightly smaller than the diameter of a nickel and with two nickels sandwiching a rubber gasket, Hoffman was able to securely plug the hole. A compartment air pressure test indicated no leakage present and the trials resumed with torpedo firing and other ship's system tests. The temporary plug was removed in the shipyard, mounted on a plaque with the label ""The Cheapest Repair in Shipyard History,"" and was the start of the ship's commemorative plaque collection."

There is a ""lead"" missile, every couple seconds it sends out a ""are you still there"" message while every second the other missiles send out ""are you being jammed? if you are jammed what is the source"" messages.  If the missiles get the ""are you still there"" message, they reply with ""yes"" if they are being jammed they reply with ""being jammed from Xheading, Ybearing"".  The SS-N-19 Shipwreck is known to be a home on jam system.  The datalinks only have to work for a few tens of kilometer range.  Now, we know that US/NATO Link 16 can transmit data at 31.6, 57.6, or 115.2 kilobits per second, and Link 16 works in missiles  If the US has something like that, why couldn't the Soviets?"

MachinePorn,35jkar,xxJohnxx,1 point,Tue May 12 05:53:19 2015 UTC,I guess most of the energy causing the explosion shown in the .gif is from the high velocity of the missile and not the explosive warhead itself?

It's unclear from wiki how much of that payload is explosives, but let's say half and let's say that it's something like RDX so carrying the explosive energy of about 225kg of TNT which is supposed to be about 4.2 MJ/kg giving an explosive energy for this warhead of about 945 MJ.

MachinePorn,35jkar,keithb,2,Mon May 11 11:46:21 2015 UTC,"If an object with that mass hit the ship at Mach 3 then the energy transferred (assuming an inelastic collision) would be .5 * 4.5x103 * (3x103 ) 2 = 20.25x109 J or 20,250 MJ and you wouldn't need any explosives.

MachinePorn,35f87l,oskay,24,Sun May 10 00:21:37 2015 UTC,"This is a good question, and shouldn't be downvoted.   Rockets need two things: A power source and ""reaction"" mass to eject.   In terms of purely battery powered, yes, that's possible.   Ion thrusters are an example. The energy that propels an ion thruster comes from electricity, not come from burning fuel (as in a chemical rocket). However, as a rocket, it still requires mass to eject in addition to electricity. (The mass supplies just reaction mass, in this case, not power.)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster  http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/propulsion/1-what-is-the-difference.html"

MachinePorn,35f87l,Praetorzic,5,Thu May 14 18:24:47 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the battery weight for this design was too much to be economical. I wonder if it's been overcome or if it just makes sense for small loads and doesn't scale well to larger rockets.  Either way pretty cool.
MachinePorn,35f87l,Lars0,6,Sat May 9 22:25:39 2015 UTC,Batteries have gotten to the energy density that for small-ish rockets with low development budgets it makes a lot more sense than developing a high performance gas-generator and turbine. They could evolve into a more traditional cycle in the future but batteries have a lot going for them outside of weight.
MachinePorn,35f87l,Sluisifer,4,Sat May 9 23:54:19 2015 UTC,"The energy density of LiPO is certainly much less than KerLOX.  About 1/10th IIRC.  However, the efficiency of using that battery power to actually pump propellant is going to be much better than e.g. a gas generator.  They say it's twice as good (95% efficient vs. 50%).  The electric motor is also likely going to be less heavy than a gas generator.  So, I think it does make some sense.  The battery is heavy, but you're going to get a little bit better performance out of your propellant, and possibly a more reliable machine.  I'm most skeptical about using such a motor on an upper stage; the battery is going to weigh just as much at the end of the burn, so it's going to contribute unfavorably to mass fraction.  For a first stage, this isn't much of an issue.  For an upper stage, it's more of a concern."
MachinePorn,35f87l,PrimeLegionnaire,3,Sat May 9 23:57:37 2015 UTC,"An electric pump is way easier to restart than a gas generator, especially in microgravity.  Perhaps this had some impact on the choice."

The RD-170 engine packs a 190 MW turbine. It weighs 9 tonnes in total and the 190 MW turbine is only a fairly small portion of its weight. It must have way above 50000 W/kg, maybe much more than that.  Maybe it's reasonable for smaller engines. After all, this is a small rocket."

Ship and utility diesel engines tend to have a much lower mean piston speed and larger bearing and piston wall surfaces, meaning it'll wear slower. 8.5 meters per second mean piston speed for a ship is typical, vs 11 to 16 meters per second in smaller high performance diesel engines. The output of a ship engine tends to vary far less as well; the running fit doesn't change as much due to changes in thermal expansion. The larger amount of space per unit of power in ship diesels means it can have wider bearing journals, larger piston surface area, and larger diameter bearings overall to spread the wear out. It's also a lot easier to cool them, when they don't have to fit a cooling system into an armored can the size of a tank. The larger oil volume and larger minimum clearances on a large ship engine also mean it's more tolerant and give longer periods between routine maintenance.

MachinePorn,35f8y2,HAHA_goats,2,Sat May 9 23:49:22 2015 UTC,Oil flow is going to be a bitch.
MachinePorn,35f8y2,GillicuttyMcAnus,1 point,Sun May 10 03:28:17 2015 UTC,"Especially in those bottom cylinders. I'm sure there is some provision to prevent hydraulic lock,  but still it seems like a real good way to get half the engine's oil stuck in the bottom cylinders."
MachinePorn,35f8y2,HAHA_goats,2,Sun May 10 14:19:56 2015 UTC,"Eh.  Probably no worse than a radial engine.  Burns off a little oil from the lower cylinders at startup, clears out, and runs fine."
MachinePorn,35f8y2,meatshieldchris,3,Sun May 10 14:55:25 2015 UTC,"On a radial though, it's common practice to remove a plug on the bottom cylinders to let any oil drain out, and to also run the engine thru by hand for a few rotations. And we're not just talking about some oil that gets burnt off in the first minute after startup, we're talking about enough oil (incompressible, greater volume than the cylinder at TDC) to bend a connecting rod.   edit- Since you don't believe me (page 10-26 ""Hydraulic Lock"")   Whenever a radial engine remains shut down for any length of time beyond a few minutes, oil or fuel may drain into the combustion chambers of the lower cylinders or accumulate in the lower intake pipes ready to be drawn into the cylinders when the engine starts. [Figure 10-41] As the piston approaches top center of the compression stroke (both valves closed), this liquid being incompressible, stops piston movement. If the crankshaft continues to rotate, something must give. Therefore, starting or attempting to start an engine with a hydraulic lock of this nature may cause the affected cylinder to blow out or, more likely, may result in a bent or broken connecting rod. To eliminate a lock, remove either the front or rear spark plug of the lower cylinders and pull the propeller through in the direction of rotation. The piston expels any liquid that may be present. If the hydraulic lock occurs as a result of overpriming prior to initial engine start, eliminate the lock in the same manner (i.e., remove one of the spark plugs from the cylinder and rotate the crankshaft through two turns). Never attempt to clear the hydraulic lock by pulling the propeller through in the direction opposite to normal rotation. This tends to inject the liquid from the cylinder into the intake pipe with the possibility of a complete or partial lock occurring on the subsequent start."
MachinePorn,35f8y2,mynameisyles657,0,Sun May 10 15:52:02 2015 UTC,"I was assuming they'd just pop on some kind of compression relief.  If you have enough oil in the cylinder to be a problem, it'll stall the starter motor out long before bending a rod.  You only get bent rods if you ingest a slug of liquid while running.  So, open the relief, spin the engine to clear the oil, close the relief and start.  I'm just speculating since I can't find anything on that engine."

MachinePorn,3561wd,delithug,15,Thu May 7 19:55:48 2015 UTC,"Seattle to Providence. My best friend went to school in Providence, so every Fall her family would pay for a one way airline ticket for me back from PVD-SEA if I would drive along and make sure the car had oil and whatnot. We had done I-90 and I-94 and wanted to try something new so we took US-2, the ""Hi-Line.""   It was awesome. We stumbled into Duluth because she was a vegetarian and heard there were some decent vegetarian options in Duluth.   This was in the pre-smartphone, pre-wifi hotspot days where you pretty much had a computer at home or the office and other than that you carried around a guidebook.   So, we roll into Duluth with a tip that there's a bookstore that will have this guidebook of good vegetarian joints in the midwest. All we know is this bookstore address. We find the place, and go into their guidebook section, and this nice lady who is also shopping there asks us what we're up to.   We tell her, and she says ""oh, this is the book you want, and in Duluth you definitely HAVE to go to THIS cafe."" Awesome, thanks lady! We buy the book, and beeline to that cafe for lunch. We chat up the waiter and he asks what we're doing in town. We explain, and I ask him where's a good place to have a beer? He says ""tell you what, I'm off in an hour, meet me at this place downtown.""   So we meet him there, and he introduces us to a bunch of his friends. We have beers, beers turn into dinner, dinner turns into more beers. We're making new friends, meeting new people. Turns out a bunch of this waiter's friends are writers for the local newspaper. Both my parents are newspaper writers. We start having some fascinating conversations over a few more beers, and finally this gal from the newspaper asks us where we are staying that night.   We actually hadn't figured that out yet, we tell her. Maybe try to find a motel downtown or pitch a tent in a park. Who knows. No no, she says, you guys can stay with me. We'd just met this lady, it was so generous of her, and SO Minnesota...   So we go home with this gal and her boyfriend, and they get us set up on couches with blankets, and we sleep like babies. Next morning, we wake up and try to give her some money or ask if we can buy breakfast to say thanks. No, she tells us, just do the same someday for someone who comes to your town.   Still haven't done that yet, but someday I will.   tl;dr Duluth is awesome. My grandpa was actually born there. Can't wait to go back."

MachinePorn,352vkc,Ken-the-pilot,122,Wed May 6 17:23:22 2015 UTC,"It’s obvious that the more fuel you carry onboard a vehicle, the further you can go. The Pennsylvania Railroad (and of course other railroads) knew this and took full advantage of their powerful locomotives, solid infrastructure and high-quality, heavy trackage for the development of large tenders. While officially cataloged by a series of letters and numbers denoting their proportions, Pennsylvania railroadmen called these massive tenders “Coast-to-Coast Tenders”.   These tenders were used prolifically on heavy-tonnage trains with locomotives that demanded a lot of fuel but needed to be run long distances and with as little downtime as possible. Coast-to-Coast tenders were developed in the early 20th century during a time when business was very good on the Pennsy. Trains needed to be moved over the Appalachians quickly and in large quantities. In order to keep refueling times to a minimum, many railroads pushed the limits of the size of their tenders. However some were limited in size due to existing infrastructure. Bear in mind that if a locomotive was too long, it couldn’t be turned on turntables smaller than it, and storage within a roundhouse or in a pasture became a problem. Luckily, the PRR spared no expense in the building of their facilities, and on the railroad’s mainlines locomotives could be designed generously.  The Pennsy developed eleven types of tenders that could be considered Coast-to-Coast Tenders. They ranged in size, capacity and weight but all were at least 51 ½ feet long and weighed over 100,000 pounds when empty. All tenders were supported by at least twelve wheels; some of the largest (like the one pictured) used sixteen. All of the Coast-to-Coast tenders utilized an automatic mechanical stoker to move coal into the firebox and obtain maximum heat/power, since it's impossible for a single fireman to move 25 tons of coal efficiently (if at all).  Locomotives that commonly (but not exclusively) used Coast-to-Coast tenders include the Pennsy’s M1s, I1s, J-Class, and even the smaller K4 passenger locomotives used C-C tenders to limit their stops. These tenders helped the railroad tremendously since now, crews could burn enough fuel to get an engine’s maximum power without worrying so much about consumption. One of the PRR’s main heavy haulers – their I-class Decapods – burned roughly 8100 pounds of coal per hour during high-power/low-speed use. An average-sized tender could power it for about 4 ½ hours before refueling of coal was necessary. The Coast-to-Coast tenders allowed the locomotive’s use to be extended to over 7 ½ hours. Now, a locomotive could travel nearly twice as far on a tender of coal. Most tenders were also fitted with water scoops under their tanks so that the train could pick up water from track pans between the rails. Invariably, the railroad could shave quite a bit of time off their schedules.  The tender pictured is officially classified as a “210 F 84” series. These tenders ran 54 feet long and could carry 21000 gallons of water and 21000 pounds of coal. When full, this series of tender weighed almost 412,000 pounds. To put this into perspective, when fully loaded, Coast-to-Coast tenders often weighed more than the locomotive that pulled it (By a lot, too. The Pennsy's I1s weighed 386,000 pounds, the M1s 390,000 and the K4 309,000). In most cases the Pennsy actually had to remove one to three revenue cars from the end of trains with C-C Tenders because of their additional weight.  You’ll notice that these tenders also come with a small cab over the water tank. These were dubbed “doghouses” and were small shelters for the forward brakeman on freight trains. The Pennsy had a habit of designing small locomotive cabs. What’s more, these gigantic tenders severely limited vision behind the locomotive and prevented the forward brakeman from doing his job. As a result, the small cab allowed the brakeman to be out of the way of the driving crew and also was given an excellent view of the train. Though not unique to the PRR, the railroad made extensive use of doghouses; especially on the C-C tenders.  Many Coast-to-Coast tenders were also fitted with handrail-like antennae that ran the length of the water tank. This was for the trainphone between front and rear-end crews. This type of antennae was the dominate mode of wired communication for much of the 40s and 50s before radio took over in the 1960s."

MachinePorn,352vkc,kliff0rd,11,Thu May 7 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Of note though, the PRR did not invent the track pans.  They were invented in the UK, and saw early use in Wales 50+ years before PRR started using Coast-to-Coast tenders."
MachinePorn,352vkc,MasterFubar,3,Thu May 7 05:17:20 2015 UTC,"You mention coal, but the main problem would have been water. I wonder how efficient those water scoops were, because practically no railroad had those.  There are two big disadvantages that I can see at a glance, first is that there would be a lot of water loss, that's certainly not practical on a desert or semi-arid region, the second is that it means split sleepers, how did they get the rails to stay at the designed wheel base apart?"
MachinePorn,352vkc,Dannei,6,Thu May 7 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"The main problems I can see in a water scoop is the maintenance concerns on it. Picking up water at high speeds can cause excessive wear and tear and getting to actual parts would be a pain in the neck.   Another I can see, especially in the northeast, is that if water freezes you cant pick it up. Your system would be really impractical in the colder months unless a heating system was installed.   Still, a lot of railroads in Great Britain adopted its use. Almost every railroad had them."
MachinePorn,352vkc,hughk,5,Thu May 7 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"I believe the main way to get around water freezing was to ensure that the water was always moving through the troughs - and we all know that often puddles and ponds will freeze whilst moving streams will keep flowing. However, that only goes so far, and certainly in very severe winters, railways in the UK did have problems with frozen troughs - as well as frozen everything else, of course."
MachinePorn,352vkc,kliff0rd,3,Thu May 7 10:52:31 2015 UTC,"Still, a lot of railroads in Great Britain adopted its use. Almost every railroad had them.   The UK is one of the better countries for them, tending to be temperate, Summers being not too hot and winters being not to cold. The main lines going to Scotland passed relatively close to the milder NE and NW England coasts. However, some freezing would have been inevitable so heating would have been needed. In all though, the temperature extremes would have been much milder than the continental US."
MachinePorn,352vkc,jazzyt98,2,Thu May 7 09:32:14 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I think they were only adopted in the NE part of the United States because of access to clean, fresh water was easy to find. Out west, I would imagine it would be harder to find good, clean water and then pump it into trackpans in the direct sunlight/heat all day long. It would be too impractical. The lack of temperature fluctuations is also important. While the NE would have warm summers and cold winters, out west the climate is more extreme on both ends."
MachinePorn,352vkc,zaphodharkonnen,5,Thu May 7 13:22:54 2015 UTC,"Track pans were actually quite common in the UK on mainlines.  They were invented in the UK in 1860s, and by 1900 every major line had them installed except the Southern Railway.  45mph was the ideal speed, but they worked at as low as 15mph. At the optimal speed, 1,000+ gallons could be taken on in the standard 440 yards of the UK track pans."

MachinePorn,352vkc,Tabdelineated,4,Thu May 7 05:30:15 2015 UTC,My understanding is the pans sat on top of the sleepers so no cuts needed. And due to their consumption they had to be sited carefully so that they could refill before the next use.

And it has to be adjustable, since every pipe size/material will have different straightening requirements."
MachinePorn,351sje,SGoogs1780,9,Wed May 6 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"A fun way of thinking of it is paperclips. It's really easy to bend a paperclip at a given radius...just bend it around a die of that radius. But have you ever tried to straighten a paperclip? Like, perfectly straighten? It's really, really hard.  Now scale everything up a few thousand times and hollow they paperclip out to make stress concentrations even more complicated.  That makes it sound like a complex problem, but even that is a huge oversimplification.  And then they have to fit all that shit in a boat. Because don't worry, steel floats."
MachinePorn,351sje,TwoAlfa,5,Wed May 6 22:01:42 2015 UTC,"Okay cool, never thought of that. Thankfully I've seen enough How It's Made episodes where they straighten spooled material to envision what you are describing - but I still can't wrap my head around how they do it to that scale.  I assume it also compensates for the fact the pipe is bending under its own weight as they feed it down to the seafloor?  Sounds like we're touching on sorcery levels of mathematics here but I'm fascinated."
MachinePorn,351sje,AirborneRodent,5,Thu May 7 02:46:00 2015 UTC,"Generally it's laid out at an angle, tension, and vessel speed so that once it hits the water it only deforms elastically under its own weight, not plastically (i.e. no permanent deformation).  That big tower on top can pivot to various angles - for deep water they actually have the tower vertical while laying.  As for the scales involved...yeah.  It is kind of mindblowing.  Occasionally you get a moment where you step back and think ""holy crap, did I just say 'it only weighs 125 tons'?"""

MachinePorn,351sje,Metal-Phoenix,11,Wed May 6 15:51:30 2015 UTC,"The blocks are usually made from a dense hardwood. They are positioned very precisely prior to the ship entering dock and are dogged down so that they don't move when the dock is flooded. It looks simple enough but a surprising amount of time, effort and calculation goes into determining the positions of the blocks prior to the docking. Any mistakes can result in uneven weight distribution which can and often does result in the keel of the ship being damaged/warped.  The rig I work on at present was damaged when it was incorrectly positioned on a floating dry dock a couple of years ago. We are finding cracks throughout the structure and accommodation. While it was on the dry dock barge, there were doors that wouldn't open or close correctly, windows randomly shattering and cracks appearing on deck and bulkhead penetrations. Finding these cracks is bad enough. I'm worried about the ones we haven't found.  Source: Marine engineer for 14 years."

MachinePorn,34uuh8,ProfessorPoopyPants,6,Mon May 4 20:45:24 2015 UTC,"With other levitated spinning sphere things you usually induce a current in them and use a magnetic field to spin them up.    this document talks about spinning rotor gauges, which I'm familiar with, and I assume they use a similar technique to get it spinning and to figure out the torque on the sphere."
MachinePorn,34uuh8,HAL-42b,15,Mon May 4 20:48:31 2015 UTC,"From the wiki section on London Moment Gyroscopes:   A London moment gyroscope relies on the quantum-mechanical phenomenon, whereby a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field whose axis lines up exactly with the spin axis of the gyroscopic rotor. A magnetometer determines the orientation of the generated field, which is interpolated to determine the axis of rotation. Gyroscopes of this type can be extremely accurate and stable. For example, those used in the Gravity Probe B experiment measured changes in gyroscope spin axis orientation to better than 0.5 milliarcseconds (1.4×10−7 degrees) over a one-year period.[36][need quotation to verify] This is equivalent to an angular separation the width of a human hair viewed from 32 kilometers (20 mi) away.[37]  The GP-B gyro consists of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz, which provides a dielectric support for a thin layer of niobium superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.[38]  A sensitive DC SQUID is able to discriminate changes as small as one quantum, or about 2 ×10−15 Wb, is used to monitor the gyroscope. A precession, or tilt, in the orientation of the rotor causes the London moment magnetic field to shift relative to the housing. The moving field passes through a superconducting pickup loop fixed to the housing, inducing a small electric current. The current produces a voltage across a shunt resistance, which is resolved to spherical coordinates by a microprocessor. The system is designed to minimize Lorentz torque on the rotor.   Emphasis mine. Those superconducting ""bearings"" can leave the sphere spinning freely and unpowered for 15,000 Years. (Although bear in mind this would not have happened in reality, as they also wanted to measure the alignment of the sphere, which by definition would have removed energy from the system and decelerated the sphere somewhat)  Machineporn indeed. And it was fired into space, enduring the accelerations of a rocket launch."

MachinePorn,34q2sg,gmuoug,5,Sun May 3 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"Centrifugal force isn't a real force, but that doesn't change the fact that it is a real phenomena that's commonly accepted descriptor is ""centrifugal force"".  While calling it a force is a technical misnomer, for all basic applications of Newtonian mechanics you CAN treat it as a force, as it is much easier to just simplify the process of tension and normal forces into a single ""centrifugal force"", especially with something where all the forces are seen in a single object, such as a rotor.  The rotational motion of the motor is causing each atom of the blade to accelerate away from the center, but the bonds between each atom hold the blade together.  tldr don't be such a fucking pendant"

MachinePorn,34q2sg,spacemanspiff30,28,Sun May 3 21:54:24 2015 UTC,Isn't one of the major problems with vtol aircraft like this that there is a point in the transition from vertical to horizontal flight where they get almost no lift? And wasn't this the cause of many Osprey crashes?
MachinePorn,34q2sg,Rooivalk1,45,Sun May 3 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I think that this is much less of a problem for smaller experimental craft such as GL. Also, the V-22 is a tiltrotor, and this is a tiltwing. Tiltwings do allow for less vibration and stressing on the wings (in helicopter mode), and this does also keep the flow of air relative to the wing the same throughout the transition process. This means that by the time the wing is facing forward, it already has a lot of air being thrust around it backwards, giving it more lift in this stage than a tiltrotor would allow for."
MachinePorn,34q2sg,vonHindenburg,26,Mon May 4 02:34:15 2015 UTC,"But, structurally, it's also much harder to scale up."
MachinePorn,34q2sg,Rooivalk1,19,Sun May 3 15:58:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, since the wing structure does need to become heavier (to scale) than that of this experimental model, and minimal force is needed to rotate the wing in a model. In a full-scale aircraft, the weight of the hydraulic system needed for the rotating wings would become a big part of the reduction in efficiency of all flying modes."
MachinePorn,34q2sg,hdconn,3,Sun May 3 16:11:10 2015 UTC,This shows it possibly? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXql26sF5uc#t=122

MachinePorn,34q2sg,palomares66,14,Sun May 3 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"The issue during transition is generating enough lift to support the aircraft. Tilt-rotors (like the osprey) don't have this issue since the wing is fixed and they can tilt the rotors to generate forward speed. Tilt-wings (like this airplane) can have this issue since the rotors and wing are coupled. This means you need to be going very fast in a forward direction during transition to account for the lower wing area. None of the osprey crashes have been due to loss-of-lift, most have been from mechanical or flight control issues early on during the test phases of the program."
MachinePorn,34q2sg,Hewhoisnottobenamed,8,Mon May 4 13:52:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was the transition as much as the hover. It is my understanding that there is a point where the downwash from the props recirculates upward and over the props again. This recirculation causes the prop to lose lift, and if it happens to only one side it basically tries to flip the aircraft."
MachinePorn,34q2sg,Kimano,16,Mon May 4 14:24:38 2015 UTC,"That's called vortex ring state, and it's fairly easy to avoid for a pilot who knows what they're doing, at least in a traditional helicopter. I don't know how different it is in a tilt rotor/wing."
MachinePorn,34q2sg,BCMM,3,Sun May 3 16:23:13 2015 UTC,"It's also relatively easy to recover from in a traditional helicopter, given enough altitude. The V-22 has the additional problem that it can tilt violently as it enters VRS."
MachinePorn,34q2sg,itsnevereasy,4,Sun May 3 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"That said, because of the higher disc loading the V-22 has a higher rate of descent threshold for entering VRS in the first place."
MachinePorn,34q2sg,BCMM,6,Sun May 3 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"the downwash from the props recirculates upward and over the props again. This recirculation causes the prop to lose lift   VRS or ""settling under power"" can happen to any helicopter. It could be only slightly inaccurately characterised as ""the aircraft flying in to its own downdraft"". It's up to the pilot to avoid situations that could trigger it and to act promptly to recover control if it does occur.   and if it happens to only one side it basically tries to flip the aircraft.   I hadn't heard about that before, and that's obviously a big difference between an Osprey and a conventional helicopter. Article here. This would presumably make it very difficult to take any corrective action once a VRS has started."
MachinePorn,34q2sg,irritatingrobot,5,Sun May 3 17:18:11 2015 UTC,The biggest problem with this sort of technology is you usually end up with something that's twice as good as a helicopter and only costs 10 times as much.
MachinePorn,34q2sg,spacemanspiff30,1 point,Sun May 3 19:13:22 2015 UTC,"But like with any technology, it always starts out expensive, then the price comes down. The idea is great in theory, but it seems that practical uses is kind of lacking so far."

MachinePorn,34n2ze,EwokStomper,-2,Sat May 2 21:08:36 2015 UTC,"It's a silly demonstration and a waste of time.  Please hear me out.  The problem with trying to target kids with this stuff is that in their mind, they're invincible.  They've likely never gotten seriously ill. Their bodies work well.  They heal quickly.  Death is simply not a part of their lexicon.  I was this way when I was a kid and did a lot of very dangerous stuff.  If you want a scared straight program, design it around something your target audience can relate to.  Back in the 90s, there was this excellent anti-smoking campaign showing this kid in his kick ass 90s room (tons of band posters and flannel) with all this cool stuff that was burning away like cigarette ash.  Guitar, TV, Video games.  All of these things were going away because the kid was spending so much money feeding an addiction that was entirely unnecessary.  THAT is how you reach kids.  Nobody dies at the age of 17 from a smoking habit, and nobody at the age of 17 thinks about anything more than a few months in the future.  The whole idea of ""every 15 minutes"" (that every 15 minutes, someone dies in a drunk driving related accident) assumes that high schoolers give a shit about some kind of global epidemic.  Those stupid ""truth"" anti-smoking ads talked about how smoking will eventually kill you, but it's all too easy to say either ""yeah, but that's not for a while"" or ""sure, but it probably won't happen to me""  That's the problem with these drunk-driving things.  A large majority of drunk drivers don't even get pulled over, much less cause horrible deaths.  These campaigns don't teach kids that drunk driving is bad, they teach them that car accidents are gruesome.  It's pretty easy for any kid to walk out of that seminar thinking ""sure, but if I'm a little buzzed, I'll be okay"".  I don't know what the solution is exactly, but for the price of an hour of helicopter time, they could probably have given out taxi vouchers to all of the seniors on prom night.  Or maybe they could focus on the much more likely scenario of you getting your ass handed to you by your dad because you broke the mirror off his car when you tried parking in the garage.  Hell, we had our football coach give us a safe-sex seminar that completely ignored the issue of STDs and simply talked about how in the event that we got the girl pregnant, we didn't have the skills to make enough money to support a kid and have any sort of fun."

Have you ever lost a close friend, or even a classmate, in a drunk driving accident? I wouldn't wish that emotional, mental, and physical pain on any human being. These campaigns are meant to give even a small glimpse into the immense pain felt by family, friends, and classmates. People will only learn the pain through experiencing even the smallest amount of it.   Not only that, you are generalizing the capacity of a teenager's ability to think and feel. The Every Fifteen Minutes campaign at my high school was extremely worthwhile. I will fight my friends to give me their god damn keys at a party.   Rest in peace, Joe."
MachinePorn,34n2ze,EwokStomper,0,Sun May 3 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss, but from what you're saying, it sounds like you never needed a campaign to expose you to this kind of incident because you lived it.  Your response falls in line with what I was saying.  Generally speaking, kids in high school haven't lived long enough to experience the kind of tragedy you've gone through and if they have, it's already too late.  I think the issue with a lot of these campaigns is that they are created by people who are very invested in their outcome likely because they've experienced the kind of loss that you have.  They want to grab the kids by the shoulders and shout in their faces ""Don't drink and drive you fucking idiot! Don't you see what happens?!""  I don' think this is the best way to reach kids.  If they haven't personally experienced the kind of outcome they're being told to avoid, they will always be dissociated from it no matter how realistic the simulation you present.  High schoolers are too focused on looking cool and getting laid to worry about death and all that stuff.  If you want to get them to pay attention, focus on something they care about, not something you care about.  If you want them to stop drinking and driving, find a way to make it uncool."

MachinePorn,34n2ze,zorlack,-1,Sat May 2 18:26:16 2015 UTC,Camera guns are actually a real thing used by photojournalists in war zones.  Check them out
MachinePorn,34n2ze,IWannaLolly,30,Sat May 2 18:39:43 2015 UTC,Most photo journalists go out of their way to not be mistaken for combatants... Not sure why you'd want a camera mount which looks like a gun.
MachinePorn,34n2ze,driftingphotog,0,Sat May 2 18:47:12 2015 UTC,"It's much more stable and mobile than other mounts, especially for telephoto shots. i have heard of problems in the past in which they were mistaken for guns. It would be interesting to find out how much they're still used."
MachinePorn,34n2ze,ptitz,5,Sat May 2 18:59:05 2015 UTC,Not at all. Camera stability isn't really  much of an issue with the camera equipment most photographers would be using in war zones. Any photojournalist who is doing that for a career is going to be able to easily hand-hold a 70-200mm lens at the shutter speeds they'd be using. Anything longer than that is likely to be ungainly and too heavy.
MachinePorn,34n2ze,blickblocks,22,Sat May 2 23:23:03 2015 UTC,"These are not used by journalists in war zones. That's like the surest way to get shot. Originally these were used in the military to train people with guns and for surveillance. The idea is that you can track objects moving at a large distance better with one of these things. Later they became a novelty popular with wildlife photography enthusiasts in the Soviet Union. Like you would go and shoot some deer, only instead of dead deer you would have a picture of it."

MachinePorn,34n2ze,vtjohnhurt,9,Sun May 3 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"As a pilot I'd ask that you stay well clear of landing aircraft.  A few intrepid photographers have been killed by small plane/gliders and even if you don't get hit, it is a distraction for the pilot at the most accident prone phase of flight (landing).  In most cases, nothing will happen but a gust or microburst can easily throw the aircraft to the side suddenly.  Getting hit by the fuselage or wing can kill you and of course the prop or rotor will shred you.  Flying stone can damage your eyes.  Please stay clear."

The discoloration at the edge is from hardening the surface the shoes ride on.  Inside the cylinder.  Only one port for oil.  There's a spool in the center of the motor that controls where the oil is going.  There's some fine scratches but nothing that will really catch a nail.  A light hone should take care of everything.  Piston shoes.    Uh oh!  Half of the copper bearing surface is wiped out.  Every shoe was like this.    Bonus pic Guts of a (slightly) smaller variable displacement axial piston pump."
MachinePorn,34nbb0,GillicuttyMcAnus,2,Sat May 2 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  Quick question about how the oil is metered/sequenced to each piston. You mention the spool in the middle of the motor? Can you talk more about that, maybe a picture of it?   So there's no valves or anything like that which control the flow in/out of oil? Or is that all done with the thingy in the middle?"
MachinePorn,34nbb0,nastypoker,3,Sun May 3 00:21:46 2015 UTC,I'll have to get more pics after the weekend.  No valves.  The spool is keyed to the shaft so they rotate together.  Pretty simple setup.
MachinePorn,34nbb0,megagrassblaster8000,2,Sun May 3 00:32:15 2015 UTC,"As the shaft rotates, different galleries in the different components line up so each piston gets the feed oil at the correct time and then it passes over the oil exhaust port and squeezes the oil out. You can see the oil gallery switching mechanism on the left side of this picture. http://www.ship-technology.com/contractor_images/hk/1-radial-piston-motor.jpg   Red will be high pressure feed to the cylinder with the piston at TDC and the blue will be low pressure return flow back to the rest of the hydraulic system.   The actual flow/motor speed control will be done by a control valve in the hydraulic system elsewhere."

MachinePorn,34e3uc,nschubach,3,Thu Apr 30 12:31:56 2015 UTC,Are there ways to design propellers that eliminate (or greatly reduce) cavitation?
MachinePorn,34e3uc,toomuchtodotoday,13,Thu Apr 30 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"Here's a fantastic submarine propeller (screw) album. Album credit goes to /u/Vepr157.  Over the years you can see the progression with the larger, swept (called skew-back) blades. There's also some greater detail that you can't quite see in those album pics where the blade tips have a ""T"" type top to them that resemble a tear drop shape somewhat. Cavitation primarily occurs right at the blade edge, or area that's moving the fastest.   On the blades pictured here, that divot seen on those two blades may be where there's a near constant bubble & pressure drop. Over many years it's developed into a divot."
MachinePorn,34e3uc,Beerificus,2,Thu Apr 30 19:30:11 2015 UTC,why do they cover the blades? is it some sort of international secret
MachinePorn,34e3uc,TheGreatAntlers,11,Thu Apr 30 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"is it some sort of international secret   Yes, it is precisely that.

MachinePorn,34e3uc,chucknation,5,Thu Apr 30 20:50:49 2015 UTC,Typically its seen as your prop technology being highly secretive. More focus on secrecy for submarine propellers was in the 60's/70's where US Navy had a significant advantage by having quieter props.   Even today they cover the latest ones more so to not disclose facts like prop surface area that would let you start to figure out shaft RPM & top speed capabilities. Why show it off if you don't have to?
MachinePorn,34e3uc,Beerificus,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:04:14 2015 UTC,Thank you!
MachinePorn,34e3uc,toomuchtodotoday,3,Thu Apr 30 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you just make a less aggressive design. Think about an airplane wing, you have a low pressure area on top and a high pressure area below, causing lift. More aggressive the design (higher effective angle of attack or higher hump), the lower the pressure is on top. Propellers are the same idea, just twisted and instead of lift you get thrust. Too low of pressure and you get cavitation."
MachinePorn,34e3uc,degner,2,Thu Apr 30 17:54:45 2015 UTC,I just watched a really interesting youtube video of how they do this on US Nuclear subs.  Very slow rotation but high thrust because of how the propellers are shaped.  Ill try to find it but I think it was a NatGeo rip.

MachinePorn,34a1wh,Ken-the-pilot,74,Wed Apr 29 14:25:00 2015 UTC,"Talk about a disgusting amount of power. The H-8 Alleghenies certainly fall into (and essentially lead) this category of locomotive with their 7,500 horsepower. Keep in mind that the largest steam locomotive ever built, the Union Pacific Big Boy, created about 6200 horsepower. Only one steam locomotive surpassed the H-8 in overall horsepower (The Pennsylvania's Q-2 Class).  The H-8’s are a product of the Chesapeake & Ohio’s requirement for an updated heavy hauler for coal drags through, fittingly enough, the Allegheny mountains where the C&O’s main coal customers were located. The line in question ran from Hinton, West Virginia to Clifton Forge, Virginia and hosted a heavy grade and a steep summit that posed a challenge for material hauling. The C&O, like many East Coast railroads at this time, depended on coal traffic as a major source of income during a time when coal was king and World War II was looming. Slews of coal trains had to be transported to sorting points both east and west of the mountains. You could say that nearly every railroad had their own heavy hauler and throughout much of steam era, were constantly trying to find ways to improve on their designs.  The biggest locomotives in use by the C&O during the late 1930s were Mallet-type articulated locomotives such as 2-6-6-2s which were becoming outdated, as they were introduced in the early 20th century. While the C&O had already ordered a batch of new “Texas” type 2-10-4 locomotives to replace these engines (and was looking to buy more), the Lima Locomotive Works saw the railroad’s need for a more capable locomotive with still more horsepower and had a design in the works. The C&O was obviously interested and starting in 1941, the C&O agreed to start making purchases.  What Lima had was the H-8 Class. The H-8 “Allegheny” was a locomotive that was, simply put, gigantic for its day. The locomotive had four 22 ½” diameter cylinders, a 260 PSI boiler and 67” driving wheels. The firebox of the locomotive was so large that a traditional two or four-truck trailing wheel set was not suitable, and a six-truck set was used. The tender of the locomotive was designed to be big enough to feed the engine’s appetite for fuel (holding 25 tons of coal and 25,000 gallons of water) yet was built small enough to allow the locomotive to fit on C&O’s turntables in use at the time.  The Alleghenies backed up their impressive size with the ability to pull 5000 tons at about 50 MPH. However, the H-8’s got most of their work done hauling 10,000-ton trains at much slower speeds. Two H-8’s could haul almost 150 loaded hoppers at around 20 MPH. While known to have achieved 7500 horsepower, the H-8’s could consistently produce about 6800 horsepower, which was more than enough for the C&O. From a modern standpoint, the world’s most powerful diesel locomotive currently (General Electric’s AC6000CW) produces roughly 6200 horsepower.  It is believed that the C&O never really utilized the H-8’s to their truest potential like the Union Pacific did their Big Boys; hauling long trains at high speeds. The Alleghenies could have been the ultimate freighter in these terms. Instead, they were delegated to heavy freight hauling, which they did very well. The Alleghenies were all out of service by the late 1950s and replaced as multiple-unit diesel operation, which was easier on railroad track and was more practical and economical, overshadowed single-unit steam locomotives.  EDIT: Added a new picture of the 2-10-4. One that is actually a 2-10-4."
MachinePorn,34a1wh,Asmallfly,15,Wed Apr 29 14:26:36 2015 UTC,Great write-up about a superlative machine! The culmination of superpower steam. Thanks for sharing.
MachinePorn,34a1wh,thehumannfish,8,Wed Apr 29 15:07:33 2015 UTC,What was it that made steam locomotives harder on the track itself?
MachinePorn,34a1wh,Asmallfly,19,Wed Apr 29 17:56:19 2015 UTC,"The huge majority of steam locomotives were of the direct drive type. The pistons were connected directly to the wheels via the piston and connecting rods. The back and forth motion of the pistons causes imbalance. This imbalance is made worse by the fact that the pistons are phased 90 degrees. When one piston is at dead center, the other is at mid stroke. This gives the locomotive a self-starting capability because there is always a power stroke. It also gives a steam locomotive the 1-2-3-4 chuffing pattern. It also makes it impossible to perfectly balance a 2 cylinder steam locomotive.   So we have reciprocating out of phase motion. We can address the reciprocating motion by adding counterweights to the wheels. This dampens the back and forth motion along the long axis of the locomotive. The problem is that it increases the up and down motion of the wheels causing something called hammer-blow. Hammer blow scales with speed and with increasingly powerful, heavy locomotives contributed heavily to track maintenance costs.   Diesel electric locomotives don't have reciprocating forces acting on the rails, and are much more friendly to trackage."
MachinePorn,34a1wh,winterd,11,Wed Apr 29 18:29:08 2015 UTC,"To add to this, there was a lot of weight sitting on the main driving wheels. For example, the H-8's had 80,000 pounds sitting on each driving wheel. That's a lot of weight to focus on a small area, which can stress lower-grade track. The C&O and other major railroads used heavy-gauge track to help with this, but constant maintenance was required including manually straightening track back into line."
MachinePorn,34a1wh,vonHindenburg,7,Wed Apr 29 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"Woah, I never knew what the ""chuffing"" sound was."
MachinePorn,34a1wh,taylorha,2,Wed Apr 29 22:00:24 2015 UTC,"The chuffing actually comes out of a locomotives smoke stack.  Exhaust steam from the pistons is released in a jet up the stack in order to improve draw through the firebox.  That’s why smoke on a locomotive comes out in discrete puffs, rather than a continuous stream.  At startup and very low speeds, you will see a continuous stream of smoke (and hear an almighty roar) because the engineer is releasing steam from the boiler directly up another jet in the stack until they get moving fast enough for there to be sufficient steam from the piston exhausts to maintain draw on the fire.  EDIT:  This is one reason why turbine-powered locomotives with condensers have had such little success.  When equipped with a condenser (which increases pressure drop, and therefore, efficiency across the turbine) a locomotive has no high pressure steam exhaust.    To make up for it, locomotives needed either a pressurized firebox with a complex airlock to put the coal through, or a blower stuck directly in the smoke stack.  Equipment living in corrosive exhaust gasses broke down quickly and added to the already mammoth reliability problems of condensing turbine locos."

MachinePorn,34a1wh,nitroneil,3,Thu Apr 30 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"That was a really nice write up. I would never have been able to explain the counterbalancing issue so clearly!  As an aside to your hammer blow portion- it is possible to perfectly statically and dynamically balance a locomotive, but only at one speed. It's a maddening design challenge, really. I can't speak to Lima or Alco's practice, but Baldwin would usually balance a locomotive with drivers of 'x' inches in diameter, for that many 'x' mph."

MachinePorn,34a1wh,DBH114,9,Wed Apr 29 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"Steam locomotives tended to be pretty reliable if regular maintenance was kept on them and they weren't operated out of their engineered-capabilities. Think of them as today's airliners. Every locomotive had to have regularly scheduled maintenance, cleanings and general repair work done in order for it to remain in service.  One thing to take into account is that the more complex something is, the more parts there are that can break. The Alleghenies were really built like any other steam locomotive but certain parts were scaled up for more power. Where you start to run into reliability problems are when you have complex systems of transmitting power such as a third cylinder (something the United States never really got with)  Side note: All that mess on the cinder box door is all air-compressor equipment for the braking systems. All locomotives have a similar system; some railroads just liked them positioned in certain places for ease of access/better looks."

MachinePorn,34a1wh,darthV8R,3,Thu Apr 30 00:21:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define power, I guess. Steam locomotives are ungodly inefficient machines, IIRC something in excess of 90% of the heat they generate goes straight up the exhaust.  That said, the Alleghenys were very, very powerful locomotives and generated lots and lots and lots of horsepower at speeds that a modern diesel could not match. If you get into the weeds of horsepower curves, a modern steam locomotive with tall driving wheels (67"", 5.5 feet, 170cm, whatever) generates its maximum horsepower at speeds in excess of 35 or 40mph. in the Allegheny's case, this was somewhere from 6-8,000hp at the drawbar. There has never been a single-unit diesel that can generate that kind of HP at track speed. Diesels generate their max HP at a much lower speed, so a 4,400hp ES44 is punching out a lot more HP when starting its train that Allegheny can, but if you want to get that train moving faster you need to add more diesels. So when people say ""oh, look at the AC6000, it's more powerful than a Big Boy"" or whatever, that might be technically true, but in terms of getting a train over the road at a respectable speed a Big Boy or Allegheny can handle more by themselves than an AC6000 can.

MachinePorn,34aii9,ifandbut,1 point,Sat May 30 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"It was a programming issue. I learned AB PLCs in college and used them for most of my professional career. Going over to Siemen's PLCs cause alot of the methods of doing things to not completely apply.  First issue is that Siemens use translated Ladder Logic. As in, all the ladder logic is translated to SLC code. Sometimes the translation is not bidirectional. So of someone writes in Ladder Logic, then someone makes a change in SLC, that change will sometimes not translate back to Ladder Logic and you'll be stuck editing SLC logic which is hard as hell to understand when you are used to dealing with Ladder.  Several UI things are alot less intuitive compared to AB. The big one being cross referencing which often does not catch everything.  Timing logic is also alot different. Doing something that would take one line of logic in AB could take 5+ of convoluted logic in Siemens.  And alot of other little things."

MachinePorn,34aii9,Oldasdirt,5,Thu Apr 30 21:07:05 2015 UTC,"No, the picture shows the offshore platform. It converts AC power, produced by the wind turbines, to DC power for long range transmission to the shore.   On land there is another station converting DC back to AC again.   When electrical power has to be transported via cable over long distances it is much more economic to convert it from AC to DC, transport it, and convert it back from DC to AC again.   Ground or under water cable has high electrical capacity compared to normal over ground high power lines. This means that there are a lot of ""reactive power"" losses, allowing less ""active power"" to be transported over cable when using AC.  To compensate this, you could put up electrical coils every couple of kilometres, which can (nearly) compensate those ""reactive power"" losses. While technically possible this would be very expensive.  However, as the capacity of the cable has no affect when transmitting DC power, there are no ""reactive power"" losses.  Both, AC and DC have the same ""active power"" losses though, so neither of both would allow completely lossless power transmission until super-conductors become readily available.  It is always a trade-off. Normal high voltage power lines are way cheaper than cable lines. If possible, AC power lines with very high voltages (400MV and more) are the preferred method, providing power transport with low ""active power"" and ""reactive power"" losses at a very cheap price compared to any other solution.  There is little to no use for DC power lines, as they only provide a small advantage over AC power lines at a much higher cost. However, there are some concepts that plan on transporting electrical power over 1000km and more via DC power lines, as on such enormous distances the small advantage becomes much more apparent.  AC underground cables are normally used for electrical power distribution grids inside cities. Normally they only cover short distances as the above mentioned problem comes into affect with anything longer than a couple of kilometres.    DC underground cables have been rarely used in the past because of the high price of the AC/DC DC/AC conversion. However, with more and more applications that require long range power transmission via cable and with the technological advance of high power electronics allowing more efficient and cheaper AC/DC DC/AC conversion, they become much more common."

MachinePorn,33r6j5,carl_pagan,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"To correct you here slightly: The focus in discovery will be in the infrared spectrum because galaxies far away are drifting away far more rapid.

MachinePorn,33r6j5,beckom2,8,Sun Apr 26 06:48:01 2015 UTC,"IIRC, Hubble only needed one repair. The other missions were planned maintenance.

MachinePorn,33r6j5,dakboy,-2,Sat Apr 25 12:31:19 2015 UTC,In retrospect all the hubble problems seem like sabotage.
MachinePorn,33r6j5,Jigsus,3,Sat Apr 25 13:20:13 2015 UTC,"After watching the recent episode of Nova (PBS) as well as some special on NatGeo, it stated a lot of the work on Hubble was not just installing COSTAR to correct the aberration but also upgrades to various detectors & gyroscopes.   Is it safe to say then that the James Webb Telescope will not be having any upgrades of it's main instrument package? Everything better have been triple-tested; everything better operate."
MachinePorn,33r6j5,coachfortner,1 point,Sat Apr 25 05:58:36 2015 UTC,"Yup, no upgrades or maintenance planned. If it fails they will have to build another one, and considering how hard it's been to budget the JWST it could take a very long time for another one."

MachinePorn,33r6j5,broo20,1 point,Sat Apr 25 05:05:13 2015 UTC,I'm not sure of the specifics but it will have to frequently make corrections due to the inherent instability of orbits in L points.
MachinePorn,33r6j5,carl_pagan,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:42:47 2015 UTC,"L4 and L5 don't actually need corrections; they're a point of stable equilibrium. But yeah, I was just wondering as to the longevity of the project if it requires consistent corrections, but the people at NASA are a lot smarter than I am, so I don't doubt that their solution is really viable."
MachinePorn,33r6j5,broo20,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:04:14 2015 UTC,yeah fuel for thruster burns will be the limiting factor for the mission. The length of the mission is projected to be 5-10 years
MachinePorn,33r6j5,carl_pagan,23,Sun Apr 26 02:13:19 2015 UTC,"Although...   When the Hubble was launched in 1990, a blunder in the design of its optics generated hopelessly blurred images. Corrective optics were installed during the telescope's first servicing mission in 1993, which enabled the sharp images that we now take for granted. But for three years the images were simply fuzzy. What to do? We kept taking data, hoping some useful science would nonetheless come of it. Eager astrophysicists at Baltimore's Space Telescope Science Institute, the research headquarters for the Hubble, wrote suites of advanced image-processing software to help identify and isolate stars in otherwise crowded, unfocused fields. These novel techniques allowed some science to get done while the repair mission was planned.   Meanwhile, medical researchers at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., recognized that the challenge faced by astrophysicists was similar to that faced by doctors in their visual search for tumors in mammograms. Using funds granted by the National Science Foundation, the medical community adopted the new techniques being used for the Hubble to assist their early detection of breast cancer. Countless women are alive today because of ideas stimulated by a design flaw in the Hubble Space Telescope."
MachinePorn,33r6j5,Mattho,5,Sat Apr 25 08:12:35 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of thing that needs to be highlighted whenever fiscally conservative tropes about research science being a money pit comes up. We know that exploration opens up new opportunities but most companies can't justify this kind of risk.  Heck, here's an idea then. Let's all chip in just a few dollars every year to fund an agency whose purpose is to explore ideas and find new economic possibilities that may or may not work out. Ideas that turn out to be plausible can be turned over to the free market for development and refinement into products that we can choose to buy. Imagine the possibilities. We could improve our standard of living like bosses in the future.   If only there were some of some kind of organization like this. But not involved with the government, because all government is bad. We'll solve this problem one day, I'm sure of it."

MachinePorn,33li5s,MasterFubar,38,Fri May 1 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"In addition to reducing drag, the four front tires increased the vehicle's total contact patch over two standard front tires. Unfortunately the P34 never succeeded as a prototype, mostly due to the tire manufacturer's failure to properly develop the small front tires."
MachinePorn,33li5s,BloodyIron,19,Fri Apr 24 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"The contact patch increase wasn't the biggest benefit for mechanical grip from this setup. Most mechanical grip comes from classical friction, which is dependent on weight+downforce. Larger contact patches take advantage of the ""interlocking"" effect, which is still significant, but not enough so to help justify this increase in complexity. The biggest mechanical of this setup is improved stability. You can run lower damping per wheel with this setup, allowing for way better stability over kerbs and bumps. I'm not sure if they employed a quad-linked heave setup on it, but that would allow you to pretty much ignore bumps with suspension setup."
MachinePorn,33li5s,ALoudMouthBaby,13,Thu Apr 23 18:12:23 2015 UTC,I wonder how did the pitstops go. That's a 50% increase in the work that needs to be done.

MachinePorn,33li5s,IHateItWhenI,2,Thu Apr 23 16:49:02 2015 UTC,"Mechanics have been well understood for much longer than aerodynamics. But yes, that is why I was unsure of the 4-link heave setup, any modern f1 that took 4 front wheels (if regulations and Pirelli allowed) would 100% have it. It's always a fun mind exercise to imagine how to optimize spring rates and damping for such a car, as with the right setup there could be up to 9 14 meaningful dampers and springs, though how meaningful would definitely be up for debate.  Edit: Man, it's been a while since I'd thought about that. Probably only 6 springs+dampers would be used, one for each wheel (4), 4-way heave (5) and 4-way roll (6). Remaining are rl and rr roll and heave (8), fl and fr roll and heave (10), fr and rl roll and heave (12) and fl and rr roll and heave (14). All those single pair roll and heaves would only serve to increase total damping on bumps and kerbs and give no more benefit than the 4-way roll and heave, which would work to control the attitude of the car on average and counteract some of the aerodynamic dive (like real heave spring systems do)"
MachinePorn,33li5s,Playererf,2,Thu Apr 23 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"Alternative front end motorcycle designs (such as hub center steering and various non telescopic forks) have the same problem.  They all tend to cause less stress on the front tire.  Normally that would be a good thing, but racing tires need to get hot to get sticky, and stress is what heats them up.  So the alternative designs effectively end up with reduced traction in races due to lack of purpose-made racing tires."

MachinePorn,33ebcs,RazorDildo,2,Wed Apr 22 04:11:17 2015 UTC,"Basically every 4 cyl bike is like that. With fuel injection, you still have to sync throttle bodies. Many owners of 4 cyl bikes make themselves syncing tubes filled with oil so they don't have to go to a shop. Of course, now the precision is higher so everything stays in sync for more miles."
MachinePorn,33ebcs,RazorDildo,3,Wed Apr 22 14:35:20 2015 UTC,"One below the middle carb is tapped into the manifold for manifold vacuum.

I manually drive the first pass and then the GPS drives parallel paths to cover the rest of the field.  Auto swathing isn't about driving, it's about GPS mapping and automatically turning off the spray (on one or more segment of the spray boom) when it's overlapping what's already been sprayed. That way overlap is minimized. Example"

MachinePorn,33abi6,scarabeetle101,3,Sun May 3 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"The boom folds in 3 sections per side, and all folded up it takes up as much space as if there was no boom at all.

EDIT:   Reactor vendors prefer large forgings to be integral, as single products, but it is possible to use split forgings which are welded together. These welds then need checking through the life of the plant. Also, whereas Generation II reactors might require some 2000 tonnes of forgings, EPR and AP1000 units require about twice the amount.   http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Power-Reactors/Heavy-Manufacturing-of-Power-Plants/  I guess technically they could continue to shape this to include ends as well, though it's not clear from this image how."

In the very unlikely but less so hypothesis that a large catastrophe or several manage to cripple most or all societies in the world, while still leaving more than say 30 people alive in a given group, it's more than likely that many facilities will remain, and often still-usable energy sources would be available, i.e. fuel stations with fuel in them, cars scaterred around with fuel in them, working solar panels and wind turbines of varying sizes, electric generators that can easily be repurposed and adapted, and so on. Sure, a lot of people would die from not knowing what to do, but humanity as a whole always relied on the few who retain the most knowledge, I don't see that aspect changing much."

It would take a very very massive disruption to snowball into some sort of global catastrophe. We're hardly that fragile.   Have you stopped to consider how truly fragile of a thing that is?    Yes, I've studied evergy and transportation systems extensively, and no, they're not fragile at all. And it's not a singular think, to be referred to as the ""thing"". You rely on several different systems every day, and one failing does not necessarily mean others will, nor are any of those systems completely irreplaceable.   How many people can call in sick for 2 weeks before it collapses?   A whole fuckton of them. Like, a lot of people. It would take a lot of people to suddenly vanish for the entire human populace to fall into dispair. Hell, WWII killed millions and millions, destroyed entire countries, and mankind was fine. 40 million starved to death under Stalinist rule and Russia is right there. The great depression of the 30s is romanticized as hell, but was proportionately much smaller than the 2008 economical crisis, one that personally hit me pretty hard, and yet the US, source of both those crisis, is still a global power, and the global economy came back pretty quickly.   You're treading on some very vague concepts there, mate, and working on very absolute terms on top of those vaguely defined concepts.

MachinePorn,3346rc,Scsdeepship86,23,Sun Apr 19 11:05:15 2015 UTC,More Info here and here.
MachinePorn,3346rc,crywook,55,Sun Apr 19 11:12:41 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: it's a vessel for making steel  From the second link:   ""It was used by the British Steel Corporation in Workington until 1975(4?) and produced the last Bessemer Steel made in Britain in 1974. It was brought to the Museum in 1978 as an example of the revolutionary steelmaking process which first took off in Sheffield.  The Bessemer process - the conversion of iron into steel - was invented and patented by Henry Bessemer in 1856. The egg-shaped converter was tilted down to pour molten pig iron in through the top, then swung back to a vertical position and a blast of air was blown through the base of the converter in a dramatic fiery ‘blow'. Spectacular but dangerous flames and fountains shot out of the top of the converter. The converter was tilted again and the newly made steel was teemed or poured out. The first converters could make seven tonnes of steel in half an hour."""
MachinePorn,3346rc,RoundyRoundy,7,Sun Apr 19 11:20:21 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, since steel is iron + carbon, the flames carbonize the impurities in the iron, turning random bits of everything into carbon, while the iron keeps being iron. Is this right?"
MachinePorn,3346rc,blickblocks,29,Sun Apr 19 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"Backwards, actually!  Pig iron (AKA cast iron in ingot form) has a higher carbon content than steel. Steel is indeed an alloy of iron and carbon, but only for a relatively small range of carbon content.  The blast furnace ""burns"" carbon out of the pig iron, producing steel... If it is done properly. Rather than smelting steel from ore or from pure(ish) iron ingots, iron ore was smelted into pig iron, and that pig iron had the carbon content reduced to produce steel. IIRC, that process scaled much better than older methods of steel production.  You are right about it removing impurities, but they can't be turned into carbon. Rather, they form oxides."
MachinePorn,3346rc,P-01S,3,Sun Apr 19 16:24:31 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the info!"
MachinePorn,3346rc,blickblocks,3,Sun Apr 19 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  I feel I should mention that ""carbonizing"" things generally means cooking off everything except carbon (or more precisely, it is called pyrolysis). Without nuclear fusion or fission, one element cannot be turned into another."
MachinePorn,3346rc,P-01S,0,Sun Apr 19 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"Just being pedantic, a blast furnace turns iron ore into pig iron. Now it would be using the BOP or Q-BOP process which is a modified Besser using pure oxygen rather than air to turn the pig into steel.  Source: Working in an integrated mill that goes from ore to finished steel."
MachinePorn,3346rc,kv-2,3,Sun Apr 19 18:36:35 2015 UTC,"In a normal blast furnace, you stack alternating layers of ore and coke. Coke is basically carbon 'foam'. It was coal that was pyrolised (heated strongly in the abscence of oxygen until you drive everything out of it, leaving the carbon skeleton).  The coke supports the ore but is also porous, allowing gas flow through it.  Now, when it is all very hot and you begin to inject oxygen from the twiers (high flow gas injectors that share a large 'bus ring' at the base of the furnace) at the bottom, the CO formed is a strong reducing agent - it now rips the oxygen away from the ore, leaving the elemental iron and the CO becomes CO2 and floats out the top of the furnace.  You now have pig iron - full of impurites and far too much carbon for steel of any sort but still 'elemental' in principle. That's where steel starts from."

MachinePorn,32zt9i,VolvoKoloradikal,6,Sat Apr 18 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"While it can perform some of the duties of a shunter, it can't perform the full duties of a shunter.  A shunter is a locomotive that is purpose built for moving rolling stock around a rail yard and possibly running on branch lines.  It is geared for high torque, but sacrifices top speed.  It can move a fully connected train, which can range in size quite a bit.  Most of the trains in my area typically run anywhere from 80 to 120.  I believe they might be limited by the length of sidings.     A rail car mover is what this thing is.  As it states in the wikipedia article I linked, it is primarily built for and used by the customer, not the rail company. This is because they're less expensive to operate.  The manufacturer website states that this model can haul 17 rail cars, though they have another model called the Titan that can supposedly move 25+.  However, it also says over flat ground.  It would be great for a manufacturing facility with it's own siding off of the company rail line for shipment of materials or products.  Now, I don't know how much railway companies use these.  I'm sure they fill niche applications, but it doesn't seem like they would meet the demands of a rail yard in typical shunting applications.   EDIT: Spelling"

Still don't really understand how a little pump can add fluid to a system with crazy loads like construction equipment.  Also don't understand how those rubber tubes or their fasteners don't just give out all the time.  Anyone who wants to jump in and give me some 101 knowledge is still welcome to.  I've read up on hydraulics and understand the very most basic premise, where it functions like a pulley when a short fat hydraulic cylinder can exert a force that is multiplied on a long skinny cylinder.  But I've never been able to wrap my head around hydraulics in this sort of usage versus something like an electric motor.  Why is hydraulic a better medium to transmit power?  If fluids can't be compressed, doesn't that mean that the hydraulic drill is only as powerful as whatever is on the other end of those pipes?  With hydraulic cylinders its easy to understand the actions that occur - but aren't some hydraulics pressurized by things similar to centrifugal superchargers?  What's stopping those blades from just spinning in the fluid and ""treading water"" as it were?  If pressure compresses gasses, what happens to fluids - do they just squirt out of their container eventually?  How is PSI in a fluid measured if there aren't obvious tangible changes like when a gas expands or contracts?"
MachinePorn,32xxcq,gnartung,13,Fri Apr 17 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"Fluid power guy here.  I'll try to answer some questions for you.  One of the biggest reasons to use hydraulics over electric motors is power density.  Look up the size difference between a 100hp electric motor and a 100hp hydraulic one.  It's much easier to control the speed and force of a hydraulic system as well. Also, electric motors don't like to be stalled   As for the pumps, anything used in a hydraulic system is hydrostatic. Those centrifugal ones you're talking about are hydrodynamic, and cannot develop pressure when met with a load.  The most commonly used hydrostatic styles are gear, vane, and piston pumps. If you put a plug directly into the outlet of one of those it will blow the case apart in less than a half second after turning it on.  I have a some pictures of the job I just got done with, plus a bunch of others I've been meaning to get up here.  Feel free to ask any questions, I'll try to answer them as best I can.   Edit- and PSI is just a measurement of force. If you set placed a cube that weighs 100 lbs with a surface area of 10 square inches on the ground, it is exerting 10 PSI of force one the ground.  Hydraulic fluid at 1000 PSI is exerting 1000 lbs of force per square inch. If that is being applied to a piston with an area of 10 inches square in a cylinder, it will provide 10,000 pounds of force."

MachinePorn,32xxcq,nutral,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:19:32 2015 UTC,"hydraulic power is very much based off of that liquid is not compressible. For hydraulics i have myself only seen gear and piston pumps and they always put out a certain volume of liquid, things like centrifual water pumps have differing output depending on the pressure.  So a powerpack always puts out a certain volume and that liquid flows into a hose to whatever uses the hydraulics, hydraulic motor are simply said pumps that are turned around in their use.   The torque of an hydraulic item like motor or piston is based off of the pressure that the pump can still work against and the surface area that the liquid is working against.  The speed is mostly based off of how much volume the pump can put out and the area it works against. so if you have a very large area you can get extreme amounts of force at the expense of speed.   the pump starts of with low pressure and starts creating flow or starts pushing liquid to the lines, this will start to work the cilinder and the pressure rises based off of how much strength it takes to do this, if the pump reaches its maximum pressure then there is usually a valve that reverts the flow back into the storage tank."
MachinePorn,32xxcq,EvanDaniel,3,Sun Apr 26 19:03:43 2015 UTC,"Fluids flow from high pressure to low pressure. If your pump can generate enough pressure, fluid will move, and the piston will move. If it's a small pump, it will move slowly; large pump will move it faster. If it can't generate enough pressure, it won't move, regardless of size. You might stall the pump or the motor driving it, or the pump might spin without moving fluid (in which case it will probably overheat).  Usually hydraulic pumps are positive displacement machines: they might have a reciprocating piston, but more common is a gear pump. In order for a positive displacement pump to move, the fluid has to get out of the way (by going into the machinery); if that requires a lot of pressure, then it will take a lot of torque to turn the pump.  A hydraulic motor is basically a hydraulic pump running backwards; sometimes that's literally true, sometimes they're similar but optimized a little bit differently.  In general, hydraulics do well when you want modest speeds, modest linear distances, and lots of force (or lots of torque at low RPM; similar considerations). Direct electric drives, or cables and pulleys and winches, will do better at longer distances / higher speeds / lower forces. Sometimes gears do better, sometimes hydraulics. The ability to control hydraulics by valves, while leaving the motors all spinning, is helpful. They also tend to fail more gracefully than geared systems."
MachinePorn,32xxcq,Lastminutebastrd,2,Fri Apr 17 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"Really asking some tough questions there, I wish I had all the answers for you but I am only a machinist and probably have about as much understanding of hydraulics as you do. I made many of the components on this drill but was not involved with the hydraulics.   I can tell you that it does take a great deal of power to run it and inside the shack behind it is a 20litre diesel engine to supply said power. We have used electric motors on other projects but they are very expensive and very heavy. Don't know too much about the hoses but I do know they are very heavy and contain a great deal of steel braiding to contain the pressure.  Like I said tho I'm not too knowledgeable with hydraulics but I hope the little bit of info has helped answer some of your questions."

MachinePorn,32vq8t,eternalfrost,10,Fri Apr 17 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"From an ABB news release in 2006:   One of the main aims of the project is to develop a new bushing for 800 kV UHVDC transmission systems that will make it viable to produce electricity in remote regions of China, India, Brazil and Africa, where vast hydropower resources remain untapped. An UHVDC link 2,000 km long is 30% cheaper than other technologies, partly because it reduces electricity losses by 30% compared with 500 kV DC or 800 kV AC technology.   I am a not an electrical engineer, so please chime in/correct me if you are, but my understanding is that HVDC is a promising choice for connecting regions with cheap generation to regions of high consumption (i.e. supergrid).  The impediment has been the expense of transforming HVDC to usable voltage/wattage for residential and light commercial use.  Basically, it makes sense for connecting Point A to Point Z, but everything in between cannot be easily served. In order to justify the expense of the line and the transformers the advantages of voltage drop must be captured and they can only be captured if there is a steady, large demand (i.e. heavy industry) to send the power to.    Alberta is the location of the research and a large installed system because there are two large supply and demand centers in Calgary and Edmonton with steady heavy industrial demand and very few small customers in between.  Perfect set up for HVDC."
MachinePorn,32vq8t,SmokedCoho,7,Fri Apr 17 06:41:40 2015 UTC,"You're pretty much right on. At the moment, the high costs of converting AC->DC and DC->AC at the endpoints requires some kind of long-distance link where the lower losses of HVDC transmission can make up the cost difference in the equipment. Sometimes we can ignore that extra cost because of the other benefits of HVDC, though.   For example, DC doesn't have a phase or frequency, so you can use it to connect two separate grid frequencies or out-of-phase grids together (Japan does this in some cases because their grid is divided between 50Hz and 60Hz). HVDC is also beneficial in underwater cable links because of the decreased capacitance in that situation. HVDC also doesn't have the skin effect (where, in AC, the charge isn't actually transmitted over the entire cross-section of the wire; basically none of it goes through the middle core of the wire), meaning you're not ""wasting"" any of your wire material. HVDC lines also can operate at the same peak voltage as AC, which gives you 40% more transmission capacity at the same peak voltage.  But like you said, it's amazing for when you've got to move a lot of power a long distance, like if you dump a bunch of energy generation in a place far from a population and then need to truck it to where it's actually used."

MachinePorn,32vq8t,Deltigre,5,Fri Apr 17 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"You're correct. AC power transmission is used because a fluctuating field is required  for transformation in wire wound transformers, and we want high voltage transmission because it's much more efficient than low voltage, high current transmission.  But, with tech that can transform DC becoming more economically viable, AC for transmission over long distances will slowly get replaced. DC does not have the issue that AC does, where some induction losses happen due to the fluctuating field generating a current in the ground, and electrical eddies.  DC to the house probably won't ever happen, at least for a long long time, because it's unbelievably expensive to transform DC, and homes would have to adapt."

A 2 pole generator spinning at 3600 rpm produces 60hz ac, but using a 4 pole generator only needs to spin at 1800 rpm. Airliners use 400 hz ac, and have a lot of poles in the gens (alternators) so they don't have to spin them ridiculously fast.  Increasing the diameter of the stator also means that, while the shaft is spinning slowly, the ends of the stator are still moving wickedly fast.  Still, water moves slow but has a lot of pressure behind it, so stepping up makes more sense than reducing :)"

Real function is to make gears run smoothly and quietly by gradually merging 2-3 teeth at a time instead of each tooth individually. An involute gear tooth profile also helps smooth the power transmission velocity.

Listen to the transmission in this video  It's probably more for quiet operation and other NVH reduction."

This affect isn't apparent to the naked eye, but this tool is meant to hilight areas where this discrepancy occurs.  It's often misunderstood though.  I believe the original author took it down for that reason.  Just because something lights up doesn't mean it was 'shopped."

MachinePorn,32p452,RoundyRoundy,6,Wed Apr 15 21:19:21 2015 UTC,My knowledge of turbine construction is relatively small so this may not be exact. The shrouds on the smaller stages are there for increasing the mechanical integrity of all of the blades on the wheel and minimizing tip leakage losses which is steam flowing around the tips of the blades/buckets rather than passing across the blade's working surface.

MachinePorn,32p452,vonHindenburg,3,Wed Apr 15 21:39:15 2015 UTC,What impresses me most is how normal looking the flywheel looks.
MachinePorn,32p452,ytokes,15,Wed Apr 15 18:29:06 2015 UTC,"Not really a flywheel, though (like the one on a car) it has teeth around the edge to engage an electric motor to serve a similar purpose....  When a steam turbine is running, the heat causes the rotor to sag a bit.  When the steam flow is stopped, the rotor must be kept turning while it cools so that it doesn't 'freeze' with a slight bend in the shaft.  To accomplish this, a small electric motor, called a 'jacking motor' engages the rotor on those teeth that you see and keeps it slowly turning."
MachinePorn,32p452,vonHindenburg,6,Wed Apr 15 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"I know it as turning motor or barring motor, because ""jacking"" to me specifically relates to jacking oil, piped to the bearings to raise the shaft.  Saying this, im a ships engineer who only did two months in a power plant so, meh."
MachinePorn,32p452,RoundyRoundy,3,Thu Apr 16 02:09:45 2015 UTC,"I've heard those phrases as well.  I work for a company that builds them and we call them jacking motors.  But yeah, all are appropriate."

MachinePorn,32p452,strig,6,Thu Apr 16 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yup.  The ""flywheel"" is actually a bull gear.  I work in a large steam power plant and we call the motor/gear assembly that rotates the turbine the Turning Gear."
MachinePorn,32p452,dracanius,2,Thu Apr 16 02:05:20 2015 UTC,Neat
MachinePorn,32p452,hexapodium,2,Wed Apr 15 21:29:30 2015 UTC,So do steam turbines and jet engines pretty much work the same but opposite? I immediately thought this was a turbofan engine.   To clarify: Jet turbines compress air into very small spaces using the same decreasing diameter blades; do steam engines gather more energy from steam using increasing diameter blades? Assuming that the steam flows towards the larger diameter because of the blade shape.
MachinePorn,32p452,dracanius,19,Wed Apr 15 19:27:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, they work by flowing steam from the smallest blades to the largest.  The reasons why are a bit subtler: the short(ish) version is that because all the individual compressor stages are attached to a common shaft, they must all spin at a common speed, or the connecting shaft would experience enormous torques as different parts of the same stage, tried to accelerate at different rates.  Therefore each stage must extract the same amount of energy per rotation (or unit time, if you'd prefer). As each stage extracts some energy, the pressure across the blade is forced to drop (and the temperature does too, by Boyle's Law) and so the total difference in energy available per unit area of blade, falls. Thus, the blade and the volume on the ""cold"" side of each blade, must get larger, so that the total energy each individual stage removes, is constant."
MachinePorn,32p452,fplay,3,Wed Apr 15 19:41:24 2015 UTC,"I figured it was something like that, but my background is in computer, not mechanical, engineering :p"
MachinePorn,32p452,hexapodium,2,Wed Apr 15 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"Jet engines are not driven by expanding steam like steam turbines are.  They compress air which is then mixed with fuel, ignited, and expanded.  This then generates the useful power, or torque.  Steam turbines take extremely high pressure and high temperature steam and essentially extract the thermal energy out of it by expanding it.  That energy is transmitted to a rotating shaft  through the blades."
MachinePorn,32p452,horsespower,3,Thu Apr 16 02:11:11 2015 UTC,"True, jets are not driven by expanding steam (unless they're a water-injected turbojet), but they are still driven by an expanding (and cooling) working fluid. A steam turbine does this with external combustion and a jet does it with internal, but the operating principles are identical. Certainly from the question, we're talking about whether a steam turbine rotary axial expander is like a jet engine rotary axial compressor; they are each other's opposite.   There is also the consideration that jet engines are a reaction engine (usable power from flow exiting the engine core) whereas a steam turbine, or a turboshaft engine for that matter, is a ""pure"" Brayton cycle engine where usable power is extracted within the engine and converted into torque on an output shaft, and the ideal output temperature and pressure is ambient, rather than the ideal for a jet (high dynamic pressure, ambient temperature). A jet can operate without an expander stage entirely, if the compressor is externally driven (as in a motorjet), although this is obviously hilariously inefficient. Obviously, a steam turbine is all expander, but it lacks the compressor stages for exactly the same reason; power is supplied elsewhere."
MachinePorn,32p452,littlefield20,2,Thu Apr 16 09:58:21 2015 UTC,"The back end of a turbojet/fan/shaft whatever looks somewhat like this too. It compresses the air then burns it with fuel and expands it out the back which is what powers the compressor. The excess heat and pressure coming out the back is the thrust or power to pin another, separate power-turbine to drive a load."

With the spacers you have shaft -> spacer -> coupler -> spacer - > shaft.  It adds in a slightly higher tolerance to the centerlines of the two shafts during rotation.  No matter how hard you make the mounting surfaces there will always be some tiny bit of movement between the motor and the gearbox shaft centerlines.  The coupler allows for some movement, but increasing the number of connections increases that allowance while maintaining shaft strength. Think of it as a really shitty u-joint. It's actually a good bit of engineering though and not shitty at all."

I would think that they could extend a platform that would give access to the teeth as they rotate the drums to make them accessible.   Edit for context: I've had dreams since my childhood about water parks with slides that lead into mulching machines. I have to supress a lot of anxieties at water slides. I love them, but maybe even moreso because I feel a sense of doom that most others wouldn't.   Huh. Re-reading this makes me realize I'm a pretty fucked up individual."

When I watched Jaws as a kid (I still haven't seen Ben Gardner's head) I was petrified for years that I'd be eaten by a shark in everyday life; like I'd be in bed on the first floor of a house and worry that a shark would crash through the wall like the fucking Kool Aid man.   I have determined since that these fears were probably irrational. Possibly.   Edit: When Sharknado came out? Vindication. I told you motherfuckers.

MachinePorn,32bql2,249ba36000029bbe9749,14,Mon Apr 13 02:10:35 2015 UTC,IIRC the layering the rear of the engine has is there to allow for heat expansion.  In a flight you may be up for a long time so the metal may expand with the heat to decrease the chance of cracking the metal.  And for it looking crooked I think the design is to allow the metal to close in like a cone to maximize directional exhaust.  So the place may not be at 90° angles and form a smal cone which makes it look off

MachinePorn,32bql2,alienjin,6,Sun Apr 12 21:41:59 2015 UTC,I recall there was a particular gun the Soviets used on their jets that would cause the plane to almost shake itself apart when it was fired. It was nearly a given the electronics would be ruined and the avionics would be knocked out of alignment - even the landing gear failing was a semi-common occurrence if the pilot used longer bursts. IIRC the gun stayed in service vastly longer than you'd imagine it would.

MachinePorn,327s5h,wiretapp,3,Sat Apr 11 16:18:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah that wasn't my question. Is it an ESCO bed, a CAT bed, WESCO, or a different design.  Most dump bodies you see that are from Komatsu, CAT, TEREX(Now CAT), etc... Have square designs in them.  ESCO makes an aftermarket bed that is designed to have Radius's all throughout instead of square corners to transfer the stress of hauling material and being loaded but the canopy doesn't look like that so I'm curious who the manufacturer is."

MachinePorn,327s5h,PM_ME_YOUR_NITS,3,Sat Apr 11 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"Those things walk at  2km/h, or close to it. If you have to move it a long way, like across a mine site, it's far quicker to move it this way. Plus, it is electric drive, so either you have a huge electric extension cord, or you would need a semi trailer mounted gen set to follow it around the mine site.   The mine near me has diesel powered shovels of the same size. They walk them down to the bottom of the mine as needed, but it takes a few days. Apparently the bearings in the tracks get so hot from the friction it can only walk for half an hour, then has to stop and cool down for half an hour."
MachinePorn,327s5h,Maxolon,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:35:30 2015 UTC,Do mines usually have a large extension cord for these things? Or is there a truck mounted generator that is moved next to these things when they are cutting at the rock face?
MachinePorn,327s5h,VolvoKoloradikal,2,Sun Apr 12 06:43:06 2015 UTC,"I'm reasonably sure that they run a cable from the main supply to the shovel, but I'm not certain. I do know that where they are used to dog coal to feed power stations, if the power station is nearby, then a line is run back to the mine for these pieces of equipment."
MachinePorn,327s5h,Maxolon,2,Sun Apr 12 10:49:42 2015 UTC,"because that would be inefficient, obvs it's being moved far"
MachinePorn,327s5h,jumble_of_letters,2,Sat Apr 11 13:18:43 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm having a hard time seeing where the breakpoint between 'let her walk there' and 'let's use a hydraulic drive platform to move her there'. It seems like a lot of overhead for setup, but I guess depending on the relative travel speeds of both methods it could be saving time, money or both."
MachinePorn,327s5h,PM_ME_YOUR_NITS,3,Sat Apr 11 13:25:36 2015 UTC,My guess is that using the tracks would require more road bed prep. Especially if turning is required. Large radius to turn in place.
MachinePorn,327s5h,quackdamnyou,2,Sat Apr 11 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's pretty slow. If they have to move it across a pit, or to another mine, it makes more sense to drive it on a truck to keep up with scheduling. Plus they are sometimes powered by an electrical high-line instead of diesel which can be a hassle to move."
MachinePorn,327s5h,Fingermyannulus,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:43:25 2015 UTC,"Track wear can be an issue too.  Normally, those tracks just move a few feet at a time.  Long, continuous drives involve a lot of extra wear of some extremely expensive hardware.  They're also made for strength, not necessarily efficiency, so the gears and fluid in the drives might get quite hot after a while."

MachinePorn,322zu9,bettorworse,5,Fri Apr 10 14:24:04 2015 UTC,"Not MRI, or CT, they use fixtures that bolt directly to the skull and landmarks preestablished by imaging.  That's 2 feet of pure lead shielding all around those sources to keep those pesky gamma rays from leaking out.    The MRI's magnetic field would interfere with the machine's operation, a lot of it being ferrous metal.  The CT would be useless due to the radiation leaking out of that beast, fogging up any image they would try to get."

The Gamma Knife part of it is just that helmet, though.

I recall YT clips of them setting up an empty gas cylinder on the patient bed of one of the old 1st generation models, and then pushing it into the influence of the field. The cylinder took off down that bed, clanging into the backside of the machine, sending parts flying off of it and winding up hovering in the middle of the bore. That is what I'm basing my doubts on.  I'm going to have to ask you to see if you recall what medical center you saw this unit at.

Simply from a size persepctive, abdominal tumors tend to get the largest because they have the most room to expand before becoming symptomatic; brain tumors, by contrast, have very little room to expand and do so in a hard, inflexible container. That doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of why tumors in one location can't be compared to tumors of another location, but it's one of the factors."

MachinePorn,323cvx,ArchersTest910,10,Fri Apr 10 13:35:18 2015 UTC,"My best guess:  This is used for testing the abilities of radio operators receiving and recording abilities, or maybe a control for testing new stations.  The drum in the middle has dots and dashes recorded on it.  The clockwork mechanism on the right side looks spring driven and has a governor(the vertical element with two cylindrical weights on it).  This turns the center drum at a constant rate (maybe the speed is adjustable? I cant be sure with just this shot).  I cant tell if there is a gear on the left side of the drum so I will assume there is for the sake of how it looks to me.  That gear meshes with the gear on the center of the drum and rotates the large gear on the far left side, attached to the stepped cam.  As the center drum rotates, the cam rotates to move the horizontal arm closest to the center drum up to transmit the next layer of the drum.    The thin metal strip immediately to the left of the drum probably has a feeler that contacts the center drum and raises the strip to make contact with the thumb screw behind the short vertical stud, bottom left side, which completes the circuit and sends the tone.    Then on the far left side you see the two points where you connect to the radio."

MachinePorn,320i2g,99drumdude,14,Thu Apr 9 19:57:52 2015 UTC,"Normally the sequence for a jet engine is compress air, inject fuel, ignite fuel, then pull some energy out of the expanding mixture (with turbines) and throwing the rest out the back as thrust. An afterburner throws more fuel into the exhaust after it goes through the turbine stage, making the gas even hotter and expanding even faster (expanding gases are easy to funnel into going very, very fast, meaning more thrust). But it's a much less efficient use of the fuel, so it's rarely used for average flight.   edit:changed ""really"" to ""rarely"""

MachinePorn,320i2g,horsespower,2,Thu Apr 9 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly true. Most jet engines use only about a quarter of the air ingested for combustion, the rest is used for cooling. Afterburners don't heat the air at all, they inject raw fuel into the airstream that still has a lot of combustible air in it and uses that to create a shitload of thrust by igniting that massive about of fuel injected into the exhaust."

MachinePorn,322pjr,zaqufant,8,Fri Apr 10 02:28:02 2015 UTC,"I guess I could give some context to this monstrosity. In agricultural states there is a big emphasis on drainage. We install tubes with holes so that excess water can drip into the pipe and drain into a nearby water stream. In most situations this is done by laying the tile in a natural downhill grade. Therefore, the most emphasis is put on making sure the tile is put into the ground falling downhill toward the outlet. If it is not water will build up and create a pond on the ground. If the extra water is drained from the soil the corn and soybeans will grow better.   In the beginning (when he used a much smaller trencher) the grade was established by using sight bars. He would set poles with specific heights and he would manually change the digging depth by how he saw the sight bars.  Later, he bought a laser leveling system. We would setup a box on a tripod that would put out a laser plane with the same grade as what we wanted to dig. We could also use the laser to survey the ground. And now we still do.  We live in the 21st century so the grade control we use now is controlled by GPS. To get precision accuracy we use an RTK system that uses a base station to have a fixed position. But we can never stress how important grade is. The tile must always be going downhill.  Here is a gif of the machine in action http://imgur.com/BmLy1cn It brings up the buckets and the conveyor puts the fill on the side. This way we can identify and fix other tile that have already been installed and deal with them by either hooking them into the new tile we lay or by just hooking them back across the ditch. Then we come back with an auger backfiller that fills the ditch back in. If there is interest in seeing that machine I will post it as well. So thats my life. Digging ditch."

MachinePorn,322pjr,Flour_power,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure ""almost untouched"" is quite accurate, but tile plows do not disturb the soil like the trencher I posted a picture of. The trouble with plows is you can't identify if you have hit a drainage line that is already in the ground, and if you do not fix an of those lines you get sink holes. So in the situation in the video they probably don't want a ditch so they can maintain the pasture but we mostly tile through farm ground so disturbing the soil isn't as big a deal.   Also, I've never seen that kind of tubing, or whatever it is they are laying. Very interesting."

If you encased the nozzle inside a housing, it would be a tight fit when the nozzle is wide open. However, wide open is used more at low speed. During high speed, high output operation the nozzle constricts and ""chokes"" the exhaust. I know that sounds counter productive, but when you're using the exhaust to push it that's what you want. Now, imagine you have the nozzle inside that cowling again. It's wide open and a good snug fit. Now, constrict that nozzle. You're now left with a big gap all the way around it. That would be an area of extreme low pressure and, therefore, drag.  I'm sure heat has something to do with it, too."

MachinePorn,320jj1,FACE_MACSHOOTY,3,Fri Apr 10 11:23:28 2015 UTC,"The ""turkey feathers,"" as they're called, kept falling off. That's legitimately the answer. Their absence increases drag by roughly 2%, so they said fuck it, let's take them off instead of figuring out how to fix it.  The reason this problem only presents itself on F-15s (as opposed to the 16 which has the exact same engine and retains the turkey feathers) is due to the buffeting that occurs at high AoA maneuvering.   To respond to a few of the other theories: They were, in fact, initially included, and although I'm not sure exactly when they decided to remove them, an educated guess is early to mid 90s. Their weight is negligible and the drag reduction would be more appreciable. Their radar signature is also a trivial matter - the 15 shows up like the broad side of a barn anyway."

MachinePorn,31w3oi,KosherNazi,55,Wed Apr 8 18:31:30 2015 UTC,"The proposed use for nuclear-powered ramjets would be to power a cruise missile, called SLAM, for Supersonic Low Altitude Missile. In order to reach ramjet speed, it would be launched from the ground by a cluster of conventional rocket boosters. Once it reached cruising altitude and was far away from populated areas, the nuclear reactor would be made critical. Since nuclear power gave it almost unlimited range, the missile could cruise in circles over the ocean until ordered ""down to the deck"" for its supersonic dash to targets in the Soviet Union. The SLAM as proposed would carry a payload of many nuclear weapons to be dropped on multiple targets, making the cruise missile into an unmanned bomber. After delivering all its warheads, the missile could then spend weeks flying over populated areas at low altitudes, causing tremendous ground damage with its shock wave. When it finally lost enough power to fly, and crash-landed, the engine would have a good chance of spewing deadly radiation for months to come.   Holy shit."

Since there is no weather in the stratosphere, fallout would be tremendously reduced.  You can also do all kinds of things by launching it far away from civilization and close to a magnetic pole (read: Alaska), specially designing a launch pad such that irradiated soil isn't thrown everywhere, etc."

MachinePorn,31w3oi,weirdal1968,-6,Thu Apr 9 17:52:22 2015 UTC,"What the hell do you mean radioactive exhaust? It wouldn't give off any more radiation than a regular reactor.  The operating principle is that hot air is sent to the turbine engines, which replaces fuel combustion as the heat generating medium. The hot expanding air is forced out the back, creating thrust.  That really is the gist of it, though that technically makes it a ramjet if I'm not mistaken. This would involve spinning a turbine connected to a low bypass fan (don't eat me if I'm wrong, I'm not an aero major).  But you're not expelling radioactive material. The coolant goes into the reactor (relatively) cool and comes out hot where it leads to some sort of interchanger where the heat is transferred to the air. The radioactive coolant stays in a closed loop."

MachinePorn,31w3oi,FoxtrotZero,0,Thu Apr 9 09:21:23 2015 UTC,"Do you really think I'm a nuclear engineer? Ground based nuclear plants have pretty strict requirements, because radiation scares people and when you're in the same place, the prevailing winds take it the same place most of the time.  I'm not sure how many cooling loops one could install before weight becomes an issue, but even one is a lot better than blowing all your air straight though the reactor core."
MachinePorn,31w3oi,JD-King,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:08:12 2015 UTC,The addition of even one coolant loop when combined with the (minimal) shielding would have made the design too heavy.

MachinePorn,31w3oi,hopsafoobar,2,Thu Apr 9 15:19:29 2015 UTC,This was a direct cycle engine so the incoming air passed through the core and its neutron flux.

Something like a C-5, what with its four huge turbofans, is probably more powerful in the strictest sense, and, ah, it's a prop plane. Can't go supersonic, which military aircraft do all the time.

MachinePorn,31svqo,MineTorA,10,Wed Apr 8 04:45:18 2015 UTC,"Do you know more about this? I'm curious about the CFD design process in general. I like the idea of numerical modeling and optimization so much better than iterative guessing, but I see how that could be excessively complicated."
MachinePorn,31svqo,Planepundit,18,Wed Apr 8 05:24:02 2015 UTC,"To be fair, optimization is basically an iterative guessing scheme, just a bit more guided typically through the formation of Jacobians.  The design process has largely been an iterative one in which designers use their intuition of fluid dynamics to suggest design changes to control certain mechanisms. A really simple example would be that the fluid in the endwall boundary layer is at much reduced axial velocity, thus it has a much higher relative frame flow angle. Twisting the blade at the root and tip will decrease incidence and reduce separation. There is tons of research and historical knowledge both internally and within academia into various loss and stall mechanisms in turbomachinery. The designer uses this background to suggest changes, implements them, tests them, and validates them or finds that they didn't work and then seeks to understand why thats the case. CFD has really cut down on the cost of the ""tests them and validates them"" phase which used to require some kind of experimental assessment (anything from a full rig test to a simplified cascade or component test). A typical program 30 years ago required an order of magnitude of more rig tests than modern programs, and seeing that rig tests can cost on the order of $5,000-$15,0000 per hour, 24 hrs a day, they represent a huge cost to the overall program.  What is really coming up in the world of numerical optimization within the context of CFD and aerospace designs is the concept of solving the adjoint equation. Essentially the adjoint of a flow solution can tell you how sensitive any objective function (say drag, lift, loss, some stability metric or a combination of any of these and more) is to perturbations in the geometry. The adjoint solution can guide you into seeing what regions of the geometry are most important to your objective function. Currently ANSYS has an adjoint solver available in beta, but it is limited to incompressible, steady flows. There are compressible, steady adjoint solvers internally to several companies (Rolls Royce, Boeing etc) and NASA has a public one iirc. The issue is that many flows of interest in turbomachinery are inherently unsteady, so developing an unsteady, compressible adjoint solver is of great interest, but there are a lot of numerical challenges there.  You also then get into the fundamental issue of optimization in that the solution is very good for the operating point or few operating points you specify, but it can potentially be very bad away from those points. Single point optimization often results in an overly tuned solution to the point you are optimizing for, while sacrificing performance or stability elsewhere in the operating envelope. This is where defining an appropriate objective function to minimize is critical, and also where the intuition of the designer is key."

I'd make the model in Solidworks, set the test parameters and let ANSYS run the FEA and go over the results. I can't begin to fathom everything that goes into doing turbomachinery with compressible unsteady flows. It's mind-boggling!"
MachinePorn,31svqo,caseycoold,3,Wed Apr 8 12:35:06 2015 UTC,This is an awesome reply. Do you have any recommendations on where to read up on this further? There is certainly something exciting about a good dose of empirical intuition that makes the difference between an equation monkey and a wizard engineer. Its almost reassuring that this matters.
MachinePorn,31svqo,Planepundit,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"Are you looking more for discussions of the design process or the actual mathematics of CFD and optimization? The former is somewhat hard as there isn't really texts explicitly on how to design these types of things. It is more texts on the physics of elements of design which the designer then combines (obviously companies have their processes and established workflows, but that is all proprietary).   Also a quick thing I wanted to say. Be careful with the word ""empirical"" in this context. Empirical typically refers to a model or design decision that is derived from experimental or numerical data without any real understanding of the physical mechanisms behind it. E.g. we ran an experiment on 5 different geometries, found this one had the lowest loss so we chose that one. Physics based or first principal based modeling is where one looks at the actual mechanisms of the behavior in question (loss, stability, heat transfer etc.) and then uses that to guide design. Obviously the latter is preferable to the former, but the physics involved here are so horrendously complex that the former is used quite a bit. A lot of the bread and butter of these big companies is their empirical database and their previous knowledge, but physical understanding is always preferable."
MachinePorn,31svqo,AKiss20,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly interested in understanding the design process at least to the point of establishing a workflow. I'd be interested in pursuing the mathematics behind it all at some point, but I'd assume it would be beneficial to understand the practical applications of CFD and its most common methods of implementation first."
MachinePorn,31svqo,Planepundit,2,Wed Apr 8 16:50:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm I don't know any texts specifically discussing workflow off the top of my head. Like I said, most of that isn't typically written down in a textbook (although companies have written training materials). A lot of the time authors include little anecdotes or examples in more technical texts. Googling around I found some stuff like this:  http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~mason/Mason_f/AIAA98-2513.pdf  https://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/ExpandingFrontiersofEngineering7308/TheRoleofComputationalFluidDynamicsinProcessIndustries.aspx  http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/fatica/papers/jameson_fatica_hpc.pdf  http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080007530.pdf  I hope at least some of that is of interest to you! If you want references on the mathematics of CFD (or at least a small portion of it, as there have been hundreds if not thousands of textbooks alone on the mathematics and implementation of CFD, not to mention journal articles)."

MachinePorn,31svqo,catsfive,2,Wed Apr 8 23:32:21 2015 UTC,"Shorter response: Aerodynamic design usually starts with intuition and experience and then moves to CFD.

That's a ballpark number I heard from a friend who captains a converted 747-400 freighter, so it's more nuanced than that, but it's useful for this calculation.

MachinePorn,31map6,thesmilefactory,3,Tue Apr 7 00:32:28 2015 UTC,"The 70 was a revolutionary tractor when it came out in 1935.  The name came from the 70 octane gasoline that it burned; the same as cars at the time.  This was new.  So was stylized cowl over the engine; one of the first attempts to introduce real industrial design on a tractor.    After the 70, came the 60, which was smaller and the 80, which was bigger.  The next generation of tractors from Oliver were the 66, 77, and 88.  These were all updated versions of the their corresponding predecessors.    Not only do they have more powerful engines and more robust transmissions, but many features that were optional on the original line came standard with the updates.  Electric start and hydraulics were the biggies."

MachinePorn,31hzps,Conpen,10,Mon Apr 6 00:53:47 2015 UTC,"When your country is too small for air travel to be an efficient means of travel to most destinations, that's what happens. The east coast might be a candidate for an actual HS train service (Acela is a joke), but it's far too dense to create the required track under a realistic budget. Plus, freight slows down everything since amtrak owns almost zero track."
MachinePorn,31hzps,dan4daniel,5,Sun Apr 5 16:25:19 2015 UTC,"If the traffic on 95 gets much worse during the summer it may become worth it, the big hurdle is, as you said, definitely acquiring track for high speed use."
MachinePorn,31hzps,misunderstandgap,2,Sun Apr 5 21:41:29 2015 UTC,"So European countries and Japan have good HSR because of the high population density and destinations being a medium distance apart, and the Northeast corridor has poor HSR because the population density is too high?"
MachinePorn,31hzps,Komm,2,Sun Apr 5 22:10:24 2015 UTC,"That and there are no passenger rail tracks. Everything runs on freight routes, and the freight trains have priority."
MachinePorn,31hzps,misunderstandgap,3,Sun Apr 5 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was being unclear: saying that HSR will not work in NE because the population density is too high makes no sense if you believe it works in Japan due to the even higher population density there. As an aggregate measure population density is not the issue.   Consider this: something like 2/3 of highways don't have enough traffic to pay for their own maintenance through gas taxes. Highways are largely funded through transfers from the general fund, which means that income taxes subsidize highway maintenance. Income taxes also subsidize highway construction grants.  Consider this: network effects make larger rail (and road!) systems more efficient. Nobody rides amtrak because amtrak sucks; amtrack sucks because nobody rides it, or even believes it can be better.  Consider this: more than half of Amtrak's revenue comes in the form of government subsidies. When amtrak has more passenger revenue, government subsidies typically drop. Amtrak is incentivized to keep senators happy (awfully large number of long-distance trains going through multiple states they have, huh?), not to provide the most efficient NE corridor service possible.  Basically, my point is this: in Europe and Japan, they pay for good HSR service. In the US, we pay for the competitor to HSR, and we pay amtrak to provide lots of pork, not to provide HSR. If amtrak focused on HSR most states would lose service, so senators vote against it even though the NE corridor would be fantastic for HSR, and amtrak's long-distance trains kinda suck.  Building HSR in the NE corridor would be about as expensive as building highway in the NE corridor. We build highways because people are using highways. Nobody uses HSR because there is no HSR."

MachinePorn,31frmv,DukeSpraynard,16,Sun Apr 5 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"No, the issue is cost. It's pretty dang simple to throw in a magical transformer box that can instantaneously sense and convert voltages and frequencies to exacting levels. It's not cheap, but the cost that transformer rectifier module pales in comparison to the rest of what is needed.   Airlines operate on slim margins and do not want to pay for the hundreds of outlets, kilometers of wire, and hours upon hours of labor to retrofit them into planes that have been in the air for decades.   That sort of infrastructure is much better suited to new construction."

MachinePorn,31frmv,TheScriptKiddie,3,Sun Apr 5 03:10:50 2015 UTC,"That's not an issue. Small electronics generally don't give a shit about frequency, because they are going to convert it to DC anyway. The general architecture of a PC power supply is a 10:1 or 20:1 step-down transformer to bring 120/240 volts AC down to ~12 volts AC, followed by a full-wave rectifier to convert it to DC, a couple of massive capacitors to smooth out ripples, and a set of switch-mode buck converters to step the 12 volts DC down to 5 and 3.3. These types of supply work equally well at 50 Hz, 60 Hz, or anything higher.  All that said, a power outlet on an airplane is probably not going to use 400 Hz AC straight from the APU. It would probably be easier to run small inverters off of the DC bus used to power the in-seat entertainment systems. Either way, there are airlines that offer in-seat power, but good luck affording a ticket. Bastards."

The ""power brick"" begins with an LC filter, a diode rectifier bridge and a few power caps. The resulting 330V or 155V DC (EU/US) voltage is then fed into a small ferrit-core transformer through MOSFET switches with a switching frequency of up to a hundreds of kHz. This way the transformer needs less iron and can be downsized. On the secondary side there is a single tap and rectifier schottky diodes for some intermediate voltage (19-22V DC) which is routed to the battery charger circuitry of the computer. Generally the battery supplies voltage to the onboard DC/DC converters (0.8V, 1V, 1.5V, 3.3V, 5V, 12V)."

MachinePorn,31frmv,TheScriptKiddie,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"No, you're right. But the mention of the LC circuit implies that a modern PC power supply is a frequency-sensitive device, and it isn't as such. If the input frequency isn't an exact multiple of the resonant frequency of the LC circuit, it will still work at reduced efficiency. Hence why a 60 Hz supply works fine at 50 Hz. Also, 400 Hz is an exact multiple of 50 Hz.  Old PC-AT power supplies did work the way I described, but they were heavy and inefficient."

MachinePorn,31frmv,AKiss20,8,Sat Apr 4 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"So the conversion of thrust to horsepower is tricky. There's the engine core which produces hot gas that drives the power turbine which runs the fan that produces most of the thrust.  But the core exhaust contributes to thrust too.  In this case I'm using the 75mw figure which is a rated power for the engine core, in that variant of the engine. Some have more some have less.  75mw is 100000hp or thereabouts. If you factor in the ""free"" power you get as thrust from the core exhaust post LP turbine, 115000hp is probably pretty close. Close enough for a Reddit anecdote!"

MachinePorn,31frmv,OneRunJunior,6,Sat Apr 4 21:20:02 2015 UTC,"So I found this article which states:   There were numerous functional challenges and limitations with the Turbine Cars, of which sluggish throttle response was the biggest. This is an inherent design limitation of turbines, as they need to spin up to over 40,000 rpm to develop full power. The Turbine Car had a one and a half second lag from first pressing the throttle. That could be considered dangerous; it certainly would by today’s standards. Throttle lag was noticeable at higher speeds too. Performance was reasonable, about 12 seconds 0-60, but substantially less than if a 383 V8 were under that sleek hood.   So... there ya go."

First, there was a several-second turbine lag each time one started off from a light. Second, fuel consumption was very high, roughly equivalent to 10 miles/gallon.   Or this one states:   People diskliked the acceleration lag of the turbine as compared to conventional piston engines. To the credit of the Turbine Car, people were impressed with the design and features of the car and with its smooth, vibration free ride. Another    Contrary to your claims, all the places I find information on it (including Wikipedia and its sources) state that it wasn't even fine for its time."
MachinePorn,31frmv,freefrogs,-4,Sat Apr 4 23:30:15 2015 UTC,"Here, this one cites customer complaints and not a comparison against modern cars   Any of those cars from that era would get multiple complaints against a car from the modern era. That point is moot. It's also convienient that you left out this part:   The consumer test program was essentially a failure. This was due mainly to the turbine lag problem, even though Chrysler's technical people tried to train the drivers to operate the cars correctly. (That is, plant the throttle to the floor while holding the brake. When the engine gets to 52,000 rpm (that's right!), let go of the brake.) When driven properly the turbine car could do 0-60 in less than 6 seconds.   So with a little tweak to how the car was operated the car could do 0-60 is six seconds (emphasis mine). THAT is fast for even a modern car, much less in 1963 where cars were normally pretty slow. Simply changing how the car idled and how the car used the transmission the acceleration problem could be largely eliminated. It helps when you don't cherry pick information that supports your position.   Contrary to your claims, all the places I find information on it (including Wikipedia and its sources) state that it wasn't even fine for its time.   That's because they weren't driving it according to how Chrylser engineered it. It's so easy to cherry pick information to make your points look more valid. With design changes to keep the engine at higher RPM and showing people how it operated they could completely elminate the acceleration lag. Did you even bother to read past what validated your opinion? It sure doesn't look like it."

What he's talking about doing is basically a brake stand. Any automatic car has to do this, it has nothing to do with the type of engine under the hood. My car has an automatic too and to do a burnout would require exactly the same actions. The reason is because you don't have a clutch to drop, you have to hold the brakes because you can't ""shock"" the drivetrain with a lot of power at once because you can't control how much is put into the transmission from the engine like you can with a clutch.   It's a 25-minute video, is there a point where he really steps on it and expects a really quick throttle response?   No, not really and not because it's not possible. That car is original and he bought it directly from Chrysler. No reason to stomp on it and possibly break something on the car when there is absolutely no chance of getting a replacement.

MachinePorn,31frmv,96385,17,Sat Apr 4 23:06:32 2015 UTC,Turbo spool is still a big deal. All of the ways used to mitigate turbo lag keep the turbine spinning in some way or another while the engine is running to avoid having to spool it up. You can't 'engineer out' inertia.

It was already pretty good as it was, 50 years later it would have been even better. Transmission performance has improved night and day since the 60's, the engine may not even need any changes to get better performance.

You understand that the effects of turbo lag in cars has been engineered out to a very large degree. The non-existent ""spool up time"" that you think was there actually wasn't. The reason is died in the 60's in because gas was insanely cheap and the leaded fuels were very bad for the engine. It wouldn't be an alternative now because of the cost of fuel is insanely high, but back then it cost too much on the sticker and since it couldn't use the cheap fuel of the day it died before it ever took off.

Oil, kerosene, and diesel all work well in this situation, hence the requirement for the tank turbines to be able to burn Jet A fuel from aircraft refuelers or diesel from other sources.  Drivetrain - turbines spin large double-reduction planetary gearsets to reduce the 10's of thousands of RPMs to something the 4 speed gearbox can handle. Then, to reduce power loss, the gearbox has 3 differentials in it so that the engines can always deliver full power to the tracks, even in a turn.  Cooling the turbines is easy - cut back on fuel. The turbines self-regulate their temperature. Suck in enough air and only a moderate amount of fuel, and they're fine.

MachinePorn,31frmv,coachfortner,3,Sun Apr 5 04:04:39 2015 UTC,A John Deere rep told me a few years back they were looking at making combines and sprayers (vehicles needing infinitely variable speed capabilities) with a divorced diesel-electric drivetrain. Electric motors make for a great transmission system.

MachinePorn,31frmv,sebwiers,26,Sat Apr 4 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"I'll take this example from another comment in this thread:   So a 777 twinjet at takeoff taking you to Miami for the weekend is producing as much power roughly as an aircraft carrier does at cruise.   Imagine an actual game of tug of war, a 777 at one end and the USS Gerald Ford at the other.  Even at full power, the 777 won't so much as make a ripple with the Ford.  As soon as the Ford engages even the slightest amount of power, she'll drag the 777 without even noticing.  Even though by one metric they are producing the same amount of power, in actuality the power they create is very different.  In a more practical example, take a Freightliner semi truck and a Ford Mustang Shelby GT500.  The Mustang can make 650hp, the Freightliner 'only' has 470.  But again, who's going to win in a game of tug of war?  My point is, trying to say 'Look what a difference 100 years makes' and then comparing a steam engine and jet turbine isn't exactly fair.  The fact that they are separated by 100 years is really irrelevant.  The train engine wasn't designed to produce HP, it was designed to produce torque."
MachinePorn,31frmv,diesel_stinks_,12,Sat Apr 4 20:41:02 2015 UTC,High horsepower is easily convertible to high torque with the help of gearing.  So take the Mustang's engine from your example and run it through a very low ratio gearbox and you'll get more torque at the wheels than the Freightliner.
MachinePorn,31frmv,sebwiers,11,Sat Apr 4 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"True, but also you'd need another ~5 tons of weight on the Mustang. There's several variables, HP, torque, 'tractive effort' or what the force is applied to, and physical medium (water for ex. in aircraft carrier reference Vs. air for the 777.)"
MachinePorn,31frmv,cumminslover007,7,Sat Apr 4 22:36:04 2015 UTC,"If you had a pair of Freightliner trucks, replaced the engine in one of them with a geared down Mustang engine and added enough weight to make up for the lighter engine, the Mustang-powered truck would easily out-pull the diesel powered truck. Power is what defines the performance of a vehicle, not torque."
MachinePorn,31frmv,diesel_stinks_,4,Sat Apr 4 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"It would also be a really shitty truck, because it would only make the needed torque in in a certain RPM range (corresponding to its max horse power).  You'd have to constantly change gears to stay in that rev range, requiring an even MORE complex drive train (and more power losses to drive train friction).  And it would be less efficient, since internal friction losses go up as the square of RPM.  Which is exactly why actual trucks have big, slow turning diesel engines that produce loads of torque at all RPM.  If they need to build an engine with more power, they just make the engine bigger (or run more boost), because hey, who cares how much it weighs, as long as it wrings every watt from the fuel."
MachinePorn,31frmv,cumminslover007,4,Sat Apr 4 23:05:54 2015 UTC,"It would also be a really shitty truck, because it would only make the needed torque in in a certain RPM range (corresponding to its max horse power).    Negative, the entire torque curve of the engine is multiplied by the gears in the drivetrain. It would be a shitty truck engine because it would gulp fuel and because probably couldn't even make it to 100,000 miles.   You'd have to constantly change gears to stay in that rev range...   Semi-truck drivers have to constantly change gear because of the narrow rpm range of the engine, having a wider rpm range would reduce this issue.   And it would be less efficient, since internal friction losses go up as the square of RPM.   It would be, yes, but not because of internal friction. There's much less friction area in the smaller engine. (edit: ...also massively reduced reciprocating/rotating mass)   Which is exactly why actual trucks have big, slow turning diesel engines that produce loads of torque at all RPM.   The discussion here is about performance."
MachinePorn,31frmv,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:38:54 2015 UTC,"Semi-truck drivers have to constantly change gear because of the narrow rpm range of the engine, having a wider rpm range would reduce this issue.   It would have to be more than as much wider than the amount by which you geared down the engine.  Lets say that the Mustang makes useful amounts of torque from 2100 to 8100 rpm.  If we assume that if geared down by a factor of 3, it's effectively giving us usable power on an output shaft that runs from 700rpm to 2700rpm ... which is pretty typical for a diesel engine."
MachinePorn,31frmv,cumminslover007,3,Sat Apr 4 23:43:33 2015 UTC,"If you geared a 7,000 rpm Mustang GT500 engine down to the same rpm as a semi-truck engine, it would be geared down 3.5:1. This would result in around 1,750 lb-ft of torque at 571 rpm and over 2,100 lb-ft of torque at peak torque at around 1,100 rpm. The 7,000 rpm redline of the engine would result in 2,000 rpm at the geared output. That thing would own a typical semi truck.  Edit: And, alternatively, you could gear the Mustang engine a bit higher, still have a good deal of torque over a wider rpm range and reduce the number of gears needed for similar pulling performance."
MachinePorn,31frmv,diesel_stinks_,2,Sun Apr 5 00:08:06 2015 UTC,"High horsepower is easily convertible to high torque with the help of gearing.   Within limits.  Producing a gear system that is durable, efficient, and quiet but can gear very high RPM down to low speeds to produce torque has actually hindered creation of more efficient high-bypass jet engines; ideally you'd want the turbofan spinning slower than the main engine."
MachinePorn,31frmv,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:24:09 2015 UTC,"You'll not get more torque at the wheels than the Freightliner. If the Mustang was geared as low as the Freightliner, you'd still see 600 lb-ft from the mustang and 1800 from the Freightliner."
MachinePorn,31frmv,misunderstandgap,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:32:50 2015 UTC,That's not how gears work.
MachinePorn,31frmv,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Sun Apr 5 05:21:57 2015 UTC,Are you agreeing with me? I was trying to say that gearing won't magically make the mustang have more torque.
MachinePorn,31frmv,misunderstandgap,2,Sun Apr 5 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"Except that the entire point of using gears in a drivetrain is to multiply torque. It's not magic, it's physics."
MachinePorn,31frmv,mollymoo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:05:26 2015 UTC,Right but the Mustang still has a third of the torque to begin with.
MachinePorn,31frmv,vacant-cranium,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:22:39 2015 UTC,But it also revs more than three times higher. Gears trade revs for torque.  Read.
MachinePorn,31frmv,gtrcar5,4,Sun Apr 5 17:45:53 2015 UTC,"How is this misconception still circulating the web?  You're forgetting about GEARS. More power literally means more torque at a higher rpm.  That Mustang engine could not only be geared to match the pulling power of the  Freightliner, it could be geared to out-pull it while going faster. The same thing goes for turbine engines, which is why they are sometimes geared down to move ships."
MachinePorn,31frmv,barath_s,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:53:04 2015 UTC,"Right, but a locomotive with 115000 hp would just ineffectually spin its wheels. If the torque from the engine produces more force than the wheel-track frictional interface can handle, the wheels will skid.  Even modern locomotives never really go above 10000 hp, because they just can't use the power. Even electric freight locomotives used for passes in Europe don't go very high, even though electric motors are relatively simple."
MachinePorn,31frmv,Dilong-paradoxus,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"I was mainly addressing this:   The train engine wasn't designed to produce HP, it was designed to produce torque."
MachinePorn,31frmv,barath_s,1 point,Sun Apr 5 22:23:13 2015 UTC,"Right, right, it's a strange thing to say since they two are somewhat interchangeable and every engine has both torque and horsepower (although it makes more sense for steam locomotives, which are not, I believe, geared).  Also in retrospect I might have replied to the wrong comment?"
MachinePorn,31frmv,LittleHelperRobot,3,Mon Apr 6 05:56:34 2015 UTC,"You can change horsepower to torque through the magic of a gearbox. All your comparisons are more to do with how the power is transmitted than the torque of the engine.  The 777 would lose against the Gerald Ford primarily because the gas generator is used to power a fan, which is inefficient at low speeds. If you hooked it up to a power turbine and gearbox and generator to power a propeller on a ship it would be a much closer fight.  For a real world example, the CF6 engines that you might find on a 767 are essentially the same engine as an LM2500 which is used in marine propulsion for, among other things, warships."
MachinePorn,31frmv,Dilong-paradoxus,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"Not because of the engine, because of what its attached to. Every US cruiser and destroyer uses gas turbines smaller than these but they're attached to power turbines geared to propellors.  5 of these engines attaches to power turbines using reduction gears would tow an aircraft carrier no problem."
MachinePorn,31frmv,citationmustang,3,Sat Apr 4 22:55:13 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't even need an aircraft carrier to pull a 777 backwards at full thrust.  A 777 equipped with GE90-115B engines is capable of 230,600 lbf (105 metric tons force) thrust at full power. This is well below the capabilities of many ocean going tugs, which are available with bollard pull ratings of up to 390 metric tons force.  On land, just two 4400hp-class freight US locomotives (e.g. SD70ACe or ES44AC) would also be enough to pull a 777 backwards.  Aircraft engines are powerful, but the tractive effort available from blowing air with a large fan isn't that great."
MachinePorn,31frmv,MisterNetHead,2,Sun Apr 5 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"If you remove the fan and install a power turbine on this engine you can produce 10x the torque and horsepower of a diesel locomotive engine, period.  Warships use gas turbines geared to propellers because the only thing next to nuclear that can produce that much raw power without the weight of a massive marine diesel is gas turbines."
MachinePorn,31frmv,BlackholeZ32,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"Don't forget electric motors. The Royal Navy's current destroyers, and aircraft carrier's that are being built now, all use diesel and gas turbines as generators and then electric motors to provide propulsion. I believe that the US Navy's new Zumwalt class ships use a similar setup, with the same gas turbines (Rolls Royce MT30) that the Royal Navy is using in it's aircraft carriers.  Most cruise ships now use diesel electric propulsion as well."

And they do - a tinconderoga class cruiser spins 20ft diameter props at hundreds of RPM using gas turbines.  Horsepower is king, torque is just gearing."
MachinePorn,31frmv,OneRunJunior,2,Sun Apr 5 21:56:23 2015 UTC,The same can be said about one locomotive and another as well.  Trains are measured not only by power but also by tractive effort.

MachinePorn,31frmv,BlackholeZ32,4,Sat Apr 4 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"This is the first good article I found to try and explain what he means. Because of the incredibly low rolling friction of steel wheels, a train needs to be tuned much more to get its load from completely still to moving just a bit, as generally once it's moving it doesn't take much additional power to accelerate. As a semi-tangentially related sidenote, having non-rigid linkages between cars helps trains start, as if they're on level ground they're basically only pulling one stopped car at a time as the slack in the connection is taken up."
MachinePorn,31frmv,BlackholeZ32,5,Sat Apr 4 21:06:37 2015 UTC,"No, horsepower is the measure of how fast you do the work. You can make an assload of torque and little horsepower because the engine you're using doesn't turn very fast. Horsepower and torque are related, but horsepower is a function of RPM and torque is what you're actually doing. Almost every diesel in existence makes far more torque than horsepower because they are low RPM engines. Formula 1 engine make an assload of horsepower but very little torque. In the V8 era anyway. They would make over 900 horsepower but something like 250 torque. Why? Because they revved the shit out of them, the RPM limit was 20,000 RPM. Since they made so little torque due to engine size limits they had to increase the RPM. Those engines idled at what your average street car redlined at, something like 6-7k RPM. They only made high horsepower numbers because they turned them so fast."
MachinePorn,31frmv,nawitus,0,Sat Apr 4 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"I can get behind your first statement. HP is power, so work per given time frame.   But having '250 torque' (whatever that is... Nm? Nmm? kNm?)  and 900 HP is not comparable... Like, at all.   You don't have more HP than torque. There's 900 HP and 250 (let's say) Nm torque. That's it. Only by bringing rpm into play, a relation is gained: P = 2pi * n * T.   You stand correct, power is a function of rpm. But also of torque.   What I'm getting at is that I'm having trouble with comparing HP and power.   One could say that an engine has low torque compared to other engines. But it surely does not have more or less torque than horsepower. It simply has a set magnitude of HP and of torque. Both HP and torque coexist. Together, they put out clearly defined rpm.   More mathematically speaking, you can multiply rpm and torque to gain something new, power. But you cannot add (read : compare) power and torque. What is the result supposed to be?"
MachinePorn,31frmv,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:36:42 2015 UTC,"But having '250 torque' (whatever that is... Nm? Nmm? kNm?) and 900 HP is not comparable... Like, at all.   I wasn't comparing them, I was telling you what those engines made as far as power and torque numbers (in pound feet for the torque).   You don't have more HP than torque.   I don't know what you mean, this is a false statement. You can easily have more horsepower than torque, a formula 1 engine is a perfect example of that. They make very little torque compared to how much horsepower they make.   What I'm getting at is that I'm having trouble with comparing HP and power.   In what way?   But it surely does not have more or less torque than horsepower.   It does. Here is a perfect example. The LS7 Chevrolet engine has more power than torque. At the end of the 2014 NASCAR season the engines were making almost 900 horsepower and about 550 pound feet of torque. You most certainly can have way more horsepower than torque. Here is a comparison between the torque and power figures of a NASCAR Cup engine and a Formula 1 engine they used to run (the naturally aspirated 2.4l V8). They make close to the same overall horsepower, but the Formula 1 engine has to turn almost twice the RPM to make it because they make less peak torque  The amazing thing about those figures, explained here is just how extremely well engineered NASCAR engines are while people think they are very low tech. They are nothing of the sort."

Both of you are being either extremely pedantic or purposefully argumentative. It's a waste of my time to continue trying to explain to both of you that simply not believing you can have lots of one and little of the other, no matter what units you use, is both possible and has been that way since humans came up with any measuring system.

MachinePorn,31frmv,burketo,0,Sun Apr 5 20:33:00 2015 UTC,Torque and horsepower are equal at 5252 RPM. Look at any dyno chart and you will see the curves cross at that point. More torque than HP means that the engine makes its peak torque below 5252 rpm and it then decreases towards redline.
MachinePorn,31frmv,sebwiers,-1,Sun Apr 5 21:33:49 2015 UTC,"How does that intersection tell me anything. The scales are independent, arbitrarily chosen. Comparing watts with Nm right there. Power with torque. That simply does not compute."
MachinePorn,31frmv,Ferrisuk,2,Sun Apr 5 03:22:55 2015 UTC,Horsepower is a function of torque. Specifically in the case of lbft torque hp=(hp*rpm)/5252. They are very much related.

MachinePorn,31dd9u,Myrmec,56,Sat Apr 4 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"I was bored so i was curious. Assuming it was pulling a 15,000 long ton train (rough guess based on googling), that's around 15,000,000,000 joules; roughly half a cruising Airbus A380. Not bad for something made in 1943."
MachinePorn,31dd9u,Kimano,9,Sat Apr 4 01:54:44 2015 UTC,"Edit: he was comparing kinetic energy of the load.... oh well I'll leave the novel.  Not even close. Not even in the same ballpark. There's something way off in your napkin calculation. Trains are very powerful but not in the same universe as an airliner.  You should be comparing an A380 to the steam engine in an ocean liner, not a train, and even then it's not even close: One 777 GE-90 engine can produce more power than the Titanic. One. http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/12/a-single-boeing-777-engine-delivers-twice-the-horsepower-of-all-the-titanics/250698/  Here's a yahoo answer, an unreliable source, and conveying thrust to horsepower is fraught with issues - but he has the right idea: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080105105311AA1zaBG  The most powerful steam locos are about 7500hp so almost 1/10th of the power needed to move a super heavy at cruise. 7,500hp is the power of one puny little turboprop on a little puddle jumper, an absolute welter-weight compared to a widebody engine. There are helicopters with that much power.  They make ""aero-derivative"" stationary versions of airliner engines for power generation etc. One A380 engine core is good for 36 megawatts, or 45,000 horsepower. At takeoff thrust that means an A380 is capable of generating enough high pressure hot gas to spin 180,000 horsepower worth of mechanical load. In the planes case that's the fan. In reality it's well over 200,000hp in aero form. So 27 of these trains pulling together, but weighing less than a few.  But since it's a jet, the core exhaust contributes to thrust too, so it's even more.   Long story short this train is very powerful but an A380 carries enough modern gas turbine power under its wings to satisfy the power demands of a reasonably sized town.  If you really want to trip, realize that an A380 at full power is producing enough power to move an aircraft carrier at well over 20knots. Nimitz class produces something around 200mw to get to 30 knots, this thing has enough nuts for 130Mw at least. You'd have to mount the engines in front of a power turbine and turn shafts, but the mechanical horsepower potential is easily there."
MachinePorn,31dd9u,horsespower,6,Sat Apr 4 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not comparing horsepower of engines, I'm comparing the kinetic energy of the train in motion.  That whole train weighed (a huge ballpark) of 16 million kilos. An average A380 is roughly 450,000.  Edit: As an aside, if we were talking about engines, you're entirely right. They're not even in the same ballpark."

MachinePorn,31dd9u,ifandbut,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:43:27 2015 UTC,Its interesting really. More drivers usually means smaller drivers and consequently lower top speed and better axle load. Making large sets of drivers usually indicating freight locomotives.
MachinePorn,31dd9u,FalconPaunch,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"You actually get a lot more information about a locomotive looking at its drive wheel diameter rather than it's wheel arrangement. Smaller wheels (~60 inches) are better for more tractive effort, but give slower speeds. Larger diameter wheels (~80 inches) were used on passenger trains for faster speeds, while sacrificing a little tractive effort.  The only way you can use wheel arrangement to tell you the type would be to look at the leading truck. 2 wheel leading trucks would typically be freight, while the extra stability of a 4 wheel leading truck was used on passenger (and fast freight) locomotives."

Diesels offered better availability, easier maintenance, were easier to operate and with fewer crew, and ran cleaner in an era when cities were enacting the earliest laws to clean up their air, plus the US had a large amount of cheap oil. A couple railroads (ones that originated large volumes of coal, unsurprisingly) made last ditch efforts to hold off conversion or find ways to make steam work better, but even they were forced to admit defeat and convert in the end. A few shortlines operated steam later and there are a few still operating on various tourist railroads but none in mainline service in regular mainline service in over 50 years.  Britain and Europe used steam locomotives a bit longer. An exact date eludes me at the moment, but it was at least a decade later, maybe even into the 70s? In the third world, steam lasted for decades longer in some places.

In the case of a 72 inch wheel, that would be 18.85 ft: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=72+*+pi+inches. 19 ft / revolution would require a 72.57 inch wheel: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=19+ft+%2F+pi."

MachinePorn,31dd9u,listyraesder,2,Sat Apr 4 13:10:46 2015 UTC,How are you calculating piston speed without knowing the distance from the wheel center the linkage to the piston is connected?  The linkage is not connected at the outer circumference of the wheel it is inboard of that and as a result moves slower.
MachinePorn,31dd9u,bdpf,3,Sat Apr 4 09:35:30 2015 UTC,"The speed I calculated is the average speed over one wheel rotation. The piston will move forward one full stroke and backward one full stroke per wheel rotation regardless of the distance from wheel center to linkage. We know what one full stroke is and how many are made per minute by knowing wheel rotation speed. From there we can calculate average piston speed.   The calculation I did: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=32+inches+%2F+stroke+*+2+strokes+%2F+revolution+*+341+rpm  Edit: Distance from wheel center to piston linkage should be half the stroke. With a 32 inch stroke, that would be 16 inches. Wheel radius is 34.5 inches, so the linkage attaches just under halfway into the wheel, which looks about right. This video gives a close look at the movement of the wheels and linkages: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca1w2-wnFQw."

MachinePorn,31dd9u,AdmiralEllis,16,Sun Apr 5 11:20:48 2015 UTC,"What's even more crazy is when you start calculating piston speed in feet per minute. A Formula 1 engine running at max speed in the v8 era was around 20k RPM. A NASCAR engine running at around 9k RPM had a faster piston speed! People like to hate on American V8's like they are dinosaurs of a bygone era, but the engineering in just those engines alone is absolutely incredible. They are masterpieces of engineering when you actually look closely at what they are able to accomplish in their rigid ""low tech"" ruleset."

If we assume a rather typical small car with 4-cylinder engine, at 70mph, you are probably looking at an engine speed between 3200-3500 rpm. An engine of this size will have a stroke in the vicinity of 90mm, so for every revolution of the engine, the piston moves 180mm (up and down). 180mm x 3500 rpm = 10.5 m/s, or about 23.5 mph."
MachinePorn,31dd9u,BlackholeZ32,2,Sat Apr 4 08:20:53 2015 UTC,"That's all up to gearing, and a bunch of other factors. A car could be turning 5000 RPM in 4th @70mph, or 2000 RPM in 5th."

MachinePorn,31dd9u,Mmilliond,-5,Sat Apr 4 03:12:20 2015 UTC,Piston speed is important because it determines how strong the pistons have to be to withstand the force and that in turn is a factor in performance and reliability. Piston speed too high without strong enough components means failure.
MachinePorn,31dd9u,smythbdb,3,Sat Apr 4 06:23:20 2015 UTC,"But force is directly linked to acceleration, can't you have a long stroke and a long conrod with very high piston speed but less acceleration than a short stroke and short conrod? Any mechanical engineers about?"

Yes, that's why NASCAR engines have higher piston speeds at less than half the RPM of the old V8 engines Formula 1 used to use. They have a longer distance to travel on every rotation so their feet per second piston speed is higher despite turning less RPM. NASCAR engines are a marvel of engineering despite being considered low tech because they don't have OHC engines. They are two different approaches to the same problem, an engine to make a racecar go as fast as possible. Of course the ruleset for each series limits them, but what they do within those limits in the respective series is flat out amazing.  This is a good article about piston speed and how it is calculated."

MachinePorn,31dd9u,ParticleSpinClass,16,Sat Apr 4 00:36:51 2015 UTC,"All steam locomotives can go faster if you are willing to ignore the the design limits and overheat the boiler thereby risking an explosion.  Which is more or less what Doc Brown did.  Use a hotter burning fuel to produce steam quicker.  Not that throwing in a single log would have made much difference, but it is correct in concept."
MachinePorn,31dd9u,TheOtherKav,14,Sat Apr 4 04:38:38 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, overheating isn't the issue, as long as the boiler has water in it.  The whole point the metal is to transfer the heat into the water.  The only time this happens is if   There is no water in the boiler (rarely) if a layer of sediment or dirt has been allowed to accumulate on the water side of the boiler, preventing heat from being transferred to the water effectively.   Most early boiler explosions (think Mississippi steamboat race) were due to engineers plugging safety valves in order to get the boiler above its designed maximum pressure, so that they could get more speed out of the engines.  Later on, though, most explosions were due to negligent engineers allowing the water level to get too low - once the water gets below the crown sheet, which is the highest part exposed to the heat of the fire directly, there is nothing to cool that part of the boiler down.  The crown sheet heats up, loses strength, and, as you mentioned, explosion.  I've never heard of a failure due to ""using hotter fuel"", unless somebody thought it was a good idea to throw some thermite into a firebox or something completely absurd.  Even then, it'd probably melt through the grates and just drop out the bottom before it did anything to a boiler with water in it."

MachinePorn,315jh2,darthchurro,4,Fri Apr 3 01:03:09 2015 UTC,"Its also that thick so that there is less leakage through the threads, and because the threads are weaker than solid steel.  Also steel gets weaker above 700F."
MachinePorn,315jh2,Insecurity_Guard,2,Thu Apr 2 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"It does not seal on the threads, there is a closure plate not in the photo, with an o-ring seal. It is a steel cylinder roughly 10"" thick with  4 ports for wires/plumbing to go through."
MachinePorn,315jh2,darthchurro,5,Thu Apr 2 04:29:26 2015 UTC,But... but... Jet fuel can't melt steel beams!
MachinePorn,315jh2,Insecurity_Guard,2,Fri Apr 3 01:05:35 2015 UTC,It also can't be extinguished by water
MachinePorn,315jh2,darthchurro,8,Thu Apr 2 06:05:14 2015 UTC,"Well obviously I'm eyeballing it... but for comparison a SCUBA tank is only about 3/16"" thick and it holds 3000 psi.  To a first order approximation pressure and wall thickness scale linearly, so you could guess than a 30,000 PSI tank would be about 1.8"" thick.  This diameter looks about double a SCUBA tank, and wall thickness should also scale linearly (to a first order) with diameter, so wild guess would be about 3.6"" thick for 30,000 psi.  This calculator (http://checalc.com/calc/vesselThick.html) agrees with me - assuming that vessel is ~1ft inner diameter, it predicts 4.7"" thickness.    Edit:  This calculator (http://www.engineersedge.com/calculators/shell_internal_pres_pop.htm) computes hoop stress alone without any safety factors as are built into the above numbers.  Depending on the quality of the steel (30ksi vs 260ksi yield) the thickness would vary from 8"" to under an inch.    So I suppose thats about right if that vessel is made from low strength steel, perhaps to save cost."
MachinePorn,315jh2,amaurer3210,12,Thu Apr 2 06:39:51 2015 UTC,Actually a thin walled pressure vessel like a SCUBA unit must be under something like 1-10th of the radius. It's not in fact a linear scale and thus your intuition is out the window here. But good on you you for showing research.
MachinePorn,315jh2,darthchurro,7,Thu Apr 2 04:35:46 2015 UTC,"You couldn't possibly have a piece of steel that large and have it anywhere near 260ksi. Even if you could, it wouldn't be consistent throughout its thickness.  The most cost effective solution was probably chosen which would be a forging with a yield strength of ~80-100ksi and a huge safety factor.  But yeah, 260 ksi is some crazy-ass steel that is for very specialized applications only."
MachinePorn,315jh2,amaurer3210,2,Thu Apr 2 07:30:50 2015 UTC,"Just scrolling through MMPDS, I can find...  250 Maraging Steel - 245 ksi yield (A basis)  Aermet 100 - 235 ksi yield (A basis)  Custom 465 - 220 ksi yield (A basis)  Yeah, those are some crazy numbers."
MachinePorn,315jh2,darthchurro,7,Thu Apr 2 05:01:04 2015 UTC,"1018 Steel  Maraging Steel  I don't know if you're being facetious or not, but compare the prices of these alloys to mild steel."
MachinePorn,315jh2,InvertedLogic,3,Thu Apr 2 05:15:57 2015 UTC,"I wasn't speculating at all about the application, you just got me curious enough to find the highest strength alloys I could from the (limited) library I have."
MachinePorn,315jh2,jimfixeditforme,3,Thu Apr 2 05:18:33 2015 UTC,If you need that high yield you are certainly in to some exotic shit.
MachinePorn,315jh2,m1l4droid,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:34:45 2015 UTC,"Still with 100ksi steel you only need 2"" of wall.  Thats a whole lotta safety factor there... unless perhaps its subject to shock loading or high temperatures, etc, which was my original questions."
MachinePorn,315jh2,MrSmellard,5,Thu Apr 2 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"You've got the philosophy all wrong. 2"" wall at 100ksi is the point when the vessel would fail, not the point when it would work. Safety factor would be huge for this much pressure.   Also the threads represent both stress concentrations and axial loading on the vessel. It's much weaker than a sphere of the same thickness."
MachinePorn,315jh2,amaurer3210,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:06:13 2015 UTC,"I work in aerospace, we design to 1.25x yield strength or 1.4x ultimate.    I understand that safety factors are frequently much higher in consumer or industrial products... but this seems pretty specialized, it doesn't look like the sort of thing Joe Schmo would pick up at Home Depot and then misuse.  Would the safety factor really be as high as 4x or more as it may appear to be?"
MachinePorn,315jh2,dumkopf604,7,Thu Apr 2 05:12:20 2015 UTC,"This is literally a bomb. And as I said, any piece of metal this size is going to have internal flaws and inconsistencies.

The rated working pressure (safe for everyday use) is 30,000 psi. I believe it was hydrotested in the 50,000 psi range (I don't have exact number off hand). A hydro test is a one time test to prove the structural integrity of the chamber to make sure it can be safely cycled up to 30,000 psi on a daily basis.  This chamber in particular was greatly over engineered because we designed it in house, for tens of thousands of pressure cycles over it's lifetime. If you are designing a chamber for only 1-2 pressure cycles it wouldn't have to be nearly as thick.  It is made of HY100, and retains its full rated working pressure up to  600°F."

MachinePorn,315jh2,CarbonGod,15,Fri Apr 3 00:57:50 2015 UTC,"So, my physics knowledge is extremely limited, but as far as I can understand, it would be annoying. Water enters a supercritical phase at 374 degrees celsius, but water's boiling point hits 374 degrees at 3200 psi. Typically of non-everyday physics, water behaves completely differently above those conditions. Therefore, you'll have inevitably burned the food anyway, but in addition you need to deal with oxidation of things you thought wouldn't oxidise and the dissolution of things you thought wouldn't dissolve.   Interestingly, the density of water at 30000 PSI is STILL only 1074 kg/m3."

MachinePorn,30y3ur,Ken-the-pilot,29,Tue Mar 31 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"I decided to post one of the most unique locomotives to grace the United States during the age of steam, and one of my top-5 favorite locomotives ever. The Southern Pacific Railroad developed its Cab Forward-Type (including their AC-Class and MM-Classes of locomotives) as a way to deal with their over 40-miles of tunnels and snow sheds along their system. The fumes coming from steam locomotives were inherently hazardous to their crews when in a closed environment such as a tunnel. Many times engineers would turn their locomotives on a turntable and run their engines in reverse along stretches of track with such hazards. This, naturally, was both an inconvenience and dangerous in that the crew had a very limited line of sight since their tender was now in front of them, and the engineer had to look behind him during operation.  In reaction to this, the Southern Pacific turned to both the Lima Locomotive Works and the Baldwin Locomotive works to help them design a locomotive to deal with this problem. The results were the Cab Forwards. The Cab Forwards were a completely new design for American railroads (though various versions of cab forwards were popular around the world; particularly Europe). Their cabs were placed in front of the boiler instead behind it. Now, fumes would be blown behind the locomotive with the crew placed at the front.  The Cab Forwards also had the bonus of excellent visibility since the boiler was no longer obstructing the crews’ view. This image from a simulator gives an idea of what the engineer saw. For some reason not many pictures of the Cab Forwards' cab actually exist!   These engines needed to be powerful in order to economically haul trains over the mountainous mainlines and divisions of the SP. Originally, the first Cab Forwards were built on a 2-8-8-2 Mallet wheel arrangement (two leading trucks, two sets of eight driving wheels and two trailing trucks with a pivot-point between the two sets of drivers for better curve handling). Later classes added another set of leading trucks to the setup, thus creating a 4-8-8-2. The latter boasted a tractive effort of over 120,000 pounds. This high tractive effort was perfect for the SP since they could utilize one locomotive to do the job of two smaller ones and doubleheading was not necessary.  All Cab Forwards were oil-burners. This prevented the need for a fireman to be stationed at the rear to shovel coal. It also was more convenient than an automatic fireman in that the oil and water lines of the Cab Forwards’ tenders could be pressurized. This allowed the flow of both liquids to be consistent no matter what grade the engine was on.  The AC-12-type pictured were the last Cab Forwards built for the SP. The most distinct feature of this class were the streamlined cabs and some had a white band along the lower-end of the face. These engines were very reliable and were used all over the SP system in all-matter of jobs. The Cab Forwards could be seen hauling both passenger and freight trains as well as acting as helper engines to move trains over grades. The Cab Forwards were also excellent for snow-removal since their high-tractive effort allowed them to push snow removal equipment with ease. Over 250 locomotives of three different wheel arrangements were built. The Southern Pacific was the only American railroad to order Cab Forwards and thus they became sort of a symbol of the railroad.  The first phase of retirements came shortly after World War II as diesels took over. The Cab-Forward had a long, very successful career spanning almost 50 years from start to finish. They were excellent engines and were a mainstay for the SP’s mountainous divisions. One locomotive is preserved in non-running condition (SP 4294) at the California State Railroad Museum.  Interestingly enough, Cab Forwards had a Leslie A-200 air horn onboard as well as a steam whistle. The SP utilized air horns on a few of their steam locomotives since an air horn’s sound could be projected a further distance away than a steam whistle and thus provided more of a warning.  If you’re interested, Pentrex has an amazing video of the Cab Forwards available for purchase. Their video documents all of the Cab-Forward classes and their operations on all of the SP system. Their trailer for it is excellent and features authentic Cab Forward sounds and colored 8mm video. Take a look at the last scene of the video. The boy in the scene always hits a soft spot for me. Imagine getting to witness such a monster at that age!"

MachinePorn,30y3ur,Owan,2,Tue Mar 31 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"To answer the horn question, if you think about an air horn, its sound is emitted through the bell in a narrow stream that moves at the speed of sound. A whistle, however, has no real way of projecting its sound and in turn, emits it in all directions.  That's the best way I can describe it. Think of it as a garden hose with those different settings on the nozzle. An air horn is much like the jet setting. You can shoot water a long distance in one direction with that setting. A whistle is like the soaker setting. You can't shoot water very far, but it is spread out in all directions instead."
MachinePorn,30y3ur,MasterFubar,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"But cannot a horn be powered by steam? They are both compressed gases, why should compressed air be different from compressed steam?"
MachinePorn,30y3ur,Owan,3,Tue Mar 31 18:46:06 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the material used to produce the sound. Rather, it's the instrument used to emit it. A horn produces and projects sound differently than a whistle. A horn passes air through a diaphragm and the vibrations create sound waves that are amplified by the horn itself.  A whistle, however, draws steam through a valve that escapes through openings on the sides. The more the valve opens, the more steam escapes and thus the deeper the tone. Variations on either of these components effect sound, tone and pitch."
MachinePorn,30y3ur,ExdigguserPies,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:53:09 2015 UTC,"So, the cab forward concept can be summarized into ""fuck the passengers"".   I'd kind of figure that either these were primarily used on freight routes or that the any negative effects on passengers were much smaller than the positive effects on the engineers. After all, passengers were always set back from the exhaust/fumes to the point where putting the source a locomotive length's closer might not have changed anything."

Improving something over time is a far better way to achieve a better end-product than ""innovating"" a new one every product cycle. Dr Ferdinand Porsche was another big believer of this and subsequently the 911 as a whole remained relatively unchanged from the early sixties to the late nineties. This includes interior, exterior, and body. Land Rover's Defender still being built today, first introduced in 1948. Boeing's 747 is another example of a proven design evolving to create a better one. Or how about Rocketdyne F-1 engine used on the Saturn 5 to send man to the moon in 1966. Did you know that it's going to send man to Mars as it's going to be used for Nasas SLS and ultimately the orion missions? The evolution of design is true engineering, because it's done right in the first place and is made better with time. Unfortunately building a something to a product cycle to fit a planned obsolescence ecosystem is how current markets operate. And lead to consumers with statements like yours."

MachinePorn,30jq01,MattyDoodles,11,Sat Mar 28 04:51:38 2015 UTC,Biggest issue I have is we have no dedicated transit rail.  This means that if a train of goods needs to go through they take priority over Amtrak making trips way longer than they should be.
MachinePorn,30jq01,zx80r,5,Sat Mar 28 13:07:00 2015 UTC,Except a train with 25 people on it takes priority over a million dollar commerce train. They hold trains for amtrack on the railway I work for. In the last 6 months something has changed where amtrack was late 9/10 times now it's been on time 98% of the time. Not sure what changed.  Anyways I agree that's the biggest problem. Sad part is there's a grade system that goes from Chicago to seattle. That was 8hrs faster than any current grade work. It was the old Milwaukie line. They tore all the bridges and rail out in the 70's for scrap. That would have been an excellent start. Especially for high speed rail.

MachinePorn,30hg1m,KCbizzy,6,Fri Mar 27 13:17:45 2015 UTC,"Ground speed is usually (possibly used to be) different from what the speedometer will read (air speed) due to wind/pressure and other variables. They use a Pitot tube which relies on air pushing into it as the aircraft moves forward. Modern aircraft and commercial aircraft I'm pretty sure are a lot more accurate and can give a ready closer to ground speed, but not all aircraft are equipped with the right gear. Control towers use radar and can give a ground speed (speed of the aircraft in relation to the ground)."
MachinePorn,30hg1m,razor3210,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"They use a Pitot tube which relies on air pushing into it as the aircraft moves forward.   For a really basic explanation, this is good enough IMO. Might not hurt to add that this air ""pushed in"" is compared to air ""brought to rest"".   Modern aircraft and commercial aircraft I'm pretty sure are a lot more accurate and can give a ready closer to ground speed, but not all aircraft are equipped with the right gear.   In my world we call that gear TSPI - time/space position information. Usually takes the form of a computer taking input from a full precision GPS receiver and an IMU and doing some filtering to come up with a position solution. Can pinpoint the position of the plane to a very high degree.   Control towers use radar and can give a ground speed (speed of the aircraft in relation to the ground).   Don't forget about radar interrogated transponders and beacons."
MachinePorn,30hg1m,sci901,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:06:02 2015 UTC,Sounds like you are far more knowledgeable about the subject than I am! My understanding of the system is mostly confined to a small area as I recently had to write a bit about how pitot tubes work for university.
MachinePorn,30hg1m,razor3210,0,Sat Mar 28 04:29:11 2015 UTC,Oh yes I understand the pilot tube and the differences but why would one want to know their ground speed?
MachinePorn,30hg1m,KCbizzy,3,Sat Mar 28 12:12:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not a pilot, but one use could be for figuring time to cover a distance, especially for the smaller ""hobby"" aircraft like a Cessna. Say you take off with 2 hours worth of fuel, flying at 100km/h with a 20km/h tailwind. In one hour you are 120km away from the airport, with an hour of fuel left so you turn around. Only now you are fighting the headwind giving you 80km/h ground speed. In one more hour, you are out of fuel and still 40km short of your return."
MachinePorn,30hg1m,SophisticatedVagrant,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:11:44 2015 UTC,Well if you have a 30 Mph wind it will alter your airspeed plus or minus that much. That can make a huge difference in a 2h flight. So ground speed gives an idea of how far/fast you are actually moving.
MachinePorn,30hg1m,razor3210,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"These planes flew so high that airspeed was significantly lower than groundspeed. As airspeed varies with altitude and weather, it is unreliable for navigation over long distances. This discrepancy gets progressively worse over distance and these were long missions flown at extremely high speeds, so navigating by air speed alone could make the crew think they're a hundred miles away from their actual position by the time they reach their target. So the crew need to verify ground speed in order to calibrate their actual speed so they don't get horribly lost."

What /u/CarbonGod is saying is that there are subtle differences between a flight cockpit and this one.  What he specifically said was ""not a fully fledged A320,"" and he's right. While the A320 is a bad example, non-fly-by-wire cockpits have tangible differences when they're in simulator form. Turning the stick does not directly connect to something, so the pressures on the stick must be simulated and, in flight, things behave differently with air on the control surfaces. The A320 is fly-by-wire so there is a less of a difference there, but there are other differences. A simulator is not a perfect environment. All he's saying.  I flew a 737 FMS once with no experience as part of a ""could someone with no experience land the aircraft?"" I grew up on consumer flight simulators and know how to fly smaller aircraft, so I actually did OK and everyone probably survived my landing. The others, not so much. Anyway, my point is when you're sitting in a simulator, the panel behaves like you're in a simulator and it can be tough to mentally think like you're in flight."

I'd like to see a comparison of raw materials vs finished parts heading into the factory and the same comparison across other advanced factories, because I've read that Tesla was attempting to maximize the in-house raw material processing. They touched on it, saying very few parts were produced outside - but I'd still like to see a comparison. It doesn't really qualify as an innovation, but rather a maximization of an existing innovation.  I'd also like a deep dive on the assembly and manufacturing differences between Tesla's drivetrain and a mature ICE drivetrain. The difference between all-electric and ICE is nuts - the only fluid system is refrigerant among other significant differences."
MachinePorn,309rae,GLeD,3,Thu Mar 26 13:30:23 2015 UTC,"I'm quite familiar with how Toyota does things. You have to realize that Toyota invested heavily in Tesla and the cars are built at the facility that used to be NUMMI, a Toyota-GM joint venture.   Watching the video above, the only differences I can see with how Toyota builds their cars are the following:   Aluminum Joining methods that are aluminum specific, especially riveting is not common in auto bodies Everything is super clean and bright! Much more automation in the assembly shop   Things that are notably NOT different from what I've seen in Toyota plants:   Stamping done in house Methods / automation in stamping department (maybe more lasers at Tesla, but that's about it) Robotic welding lines look pretty standard Giant lifter robots (great PR but one of the oldest and most common things I've seen in the 4 plants I'm familiar with) Paint shop at newer Toyota plants is like the one illustrated. Those automated human-less paint shops are a maintenance nightmare by the way.    I mean automotive automation is cool and all, but the engineers talking about how different it is are really talking about matters of degree rather than revolutionary changes.  More automation, higher reliance on newer methods of cutting and joining.  Overall though, the basic structure of the plant, technologies and processes is the same."

MachinePorn,309rae,toomuchtodotoday,3,Wed Mar 25 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"Jan. 5, 2015, 2:37 PM: Panasonic’s Chairman and CEO Joe Taylor said at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show that he expects Tesla to produce 500,000 electric vehicles by 2020, with the help of the Gigafactory, a $5 billion production facility the two companies are building together.  That’s nearly 15x growth from last year, when Tesla manufactured roughly 35,000 units.  The Gigafactory is a massive production plant Tesla and Panasonic are building together in the state of Nevada. It will primarily serve to produce lithium-ion batteries for Tesla’s cars at a lower cost. Panasonic jointly builds the battery cells used in the Model S and has promised to invest “tens of billions of yen (hundreds of millions of dollars)” in the plant.  The cost of batteries have often been cited as the biggest hurdle Tesla faces in growing its footprint. With the new Gigafactory, Tesla expects to lower the cost of battery production by nearly 30%.  The Gigafacotry, scheduled to open in 2017, is planning to hire more than 6,500 people, and will span across 10 million square feet.   http://my.teslamotors.com/fr_CH/forum/forums/panasonic-ceo-tesla-will-be-making-500000-cars-year-2020"

MachinePorn,309rae,oh_noes,3,Wed Mar 25 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there's not a whole lot of ""robot tending"" after the initial setup. There's tweaks to the process here and there, but from my understanding, there's a whole bunch of work getting it set up for production, and then (hopefully) you don't have to change much unless you need to change the task or improve the sequence. Every now and then I'll walk by the line and see some guy with the pendant walking the robots through a new routine, but the whole point is that they can run (theoretically) 24/7 without any supervision.  If you're interested in industrial robot programming, I would think the manufacturers (Kuka, Fanuc, etc) would be the place to go. That's where all the complicated programming is - once they make it to the production line it's designed to be relatively easy to set up for specific applications."

I doubt it would be as big of a jump as say, FORTRAN to modern languages, but I'm sure there will be significant improvements in 10 years. Laser scanning/measurement in combination with camera systems is just starting to get good enough to use reliably, and will likely continue to improve."

MachinePorn,309rae,oh_noes,3,Thu Mar 26 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"Honesly, I don't know. There's likely some overlap, not sure how much. I assume they have a way you could feed them G-Code and they would follow the path with whatever tool is on the end effector. 6DOF robots are a bit more complex than a 3 or 4 axis CNC, mainly because they have a much larger range (safety sphere/sphere of influence). You have to keep in mind not just the position of the tool, but also of the multi-joint arms attached to that tool.   There's also a lot of programming that is just making sure they don't tangle themselves up by, say, rotating a forearm joint one revolution right and two revolutions left every cycle. That would quickly tangle itself up unless you add in an extra right revolution. With more than a couple robots working in sync in close proximity, just getting the weld/cut/whatever in the correct spot is part of the problem. The other part is not hitting anything else while you're doing it."
MachinePorn,309rae,atetuna,2,Thu Mar 26 03:57:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I figured it would be similar in complexity to programming a 5 or 6 axis mill, although I don't have experience doing that, and probably won't unless I move.  I'm considering moving to Seattle, so I might get a chance to try that, and hopefully a shot at working with those robots too since they can be used for loading cnc centers.

Links to forums, youtube channels and such would be great if you can easily share them.  I found some Kuka tutorials on youtube, but most of them are in spanish and my spanish is way too poor to keep up with them.  I'm in a cnc program right now and there's about zero chance of us getting a KUKA or any type of robotic arm, but I still want to try learning about them before I move to a city that will have them."
MachinePorn,309rae,xxJohnxx,2,Wed Mar 25 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"Well, that is more or less what I did. Currently I am a final year electrical engineering student. We have to perform a graded project with one or two other team members.   I am working on a project that uses a industrial camera for object recognition, a Siemens S7 PLC for communication and process handling as well as a KUKA KR3 for object pick and place.  Basically we have a working surfaces on which the camera can recognize and identify different cubes which the KUKA then will pick up and place onto their designated positions.   We did not have any classes on how to program the robot, so we had to learn everything by ourselves.   We had the standard KUKA documentation (several documents with a couple hundred pages; however some parts of all documents has been the same) to program it for our needs.   Here are a couple of useful links:  Brief overview over the programming language:  Kuka programming language basics  We don't exactly have this manual, but from what I have seen while looking into it, it should be pretty close:  Kuka System Software  For your more advanced needs (there is also a Kuka Basic Programming manual around somewhere. Couldn't find it from a trustable source within a short search. Most of it seems to be covered in the System Software manual anyway.)  Kuka Expert Programming  That's about all you will need to be going with the KUKAs. It can get you going on how to program these robots. However, unfortunately there is a lot of stuff that is very hard to find in the manuals that just need experience, like setting up the I/O safety ports for robot operation. There are many more manuals available that are quit hard to find and that we don't use. Not directly required for programming though.  Some of the linked manuals are also for the older versions of Kuka Robot Control (the computer operating the robot). The visuals might have changed, but the programming is still the same, so that shouldn't be a problem.  Another point worth mentioning is that many (or at least some) companies don't program KUKAs with the default programming utilities but use external, PC based software that can have various different configurations and ways to program the robot. A bit to advanced at this point though. Learning to program the robot just by itself is a good start in my opinion.  Hope that was of some help. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. I will try to provide answers within my knowledge."

In a way I'm glad you know what it's like, but regret that it's because of lack of access to the equipment.  While I'm learning CNC, I've had precious little time in the machine shop because the school has been very slow in getting it moved from the old shop and completely set up and upgraded."
MachinePorn,309rae,xxJohnxx,2,Sun Mar 29 08:48:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the school system here is a bit strange in that regard. We have good equipment (often funded by the local industry), which finds little to no use because there are just no classes designated for it.   Because of that, the camera (a Cognex is5400) and the KUKA KR3, both quit expensive had little to no use in the recent years. In my eyes that's just strange. A lot of students could use that training on the robot, especially given the education our school intends to give us, but there is not enough time for that. Instead we have 2 history and 2 gym lessons in the final year of our education. :/"
MachinePorn,309rae,atetuna,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:44:48 2015 UTC,I'd love for local industry to do that for my shop.  The businesses around here aren't nearly big enough for something like that though.  You're not in the Seattle area are you?  My sister teaches around there and says there are public high schools with incredible resources for science and engineering students.  I'm sure that tools available to vocational and college students is even better.
MachinePorn,309rae,xxJohnxx,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"Seattle is very nice, have been there during my summer vacation! But no, I live quit far away from it in Austria.   There is a lot of local industry (plastics, machining and electrical engineering) that depends on the graduates from the school type I am visiting. The reasons for that is that graduates are neither Bachelors nor Masters, the education we get however is just slightly below Bachelor level. This means that the industry does not have to pay for expensive university students, but can get away cheaper with this schools graduates.   To make sure the graduates get good education, some of the big companies that need our graduates urgently, invest huge sums into the school.   The school type itself is called HTL - Höhere Technische Lehranstalt, which translates into ""higher technical school"". There are a couple of those schools in each state. The education programs they provide depend on the needs of the local industry. Ours provides electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and plastic engineering (probably not the right word for that), but there are other educations such as, electronic engineering, building, weapon engineering and a couple more different types available as well.    However, not all of the HTL are as well supported by the local industry as the ones in the area I live in. Some of them only get the normal state funding that often is just barely enough for the central heating, while we are getting the latest and greatest CNC mills, plasma cutters, injection molding machines and even an electric car.   Unfortunately there are no Universities around, as there are only a few technical based ones in Austria, so I will probably have to leave for Switzerland or Germany within the next year.   But yeah, I guess especially in areas with big industry the local schools, colleges and universities get a lot of attention from the industry, often leaving them with much better equipment."

MachinePorn,305b8r,Ken-the-pilot,74,Tue Mar 24 16:36:17 2015 UTC,"Far and away one of my favorite locomotives of all time. The handsomely streamlined T1 Class was built by both the Pennsylvania's own Altoona Shops and the Baldwin Locomotives Works between 1942 and 1946. It was built with a symmetrical 4-4-4-4 wheel arrangement, meaning four leading trucks, two sets of four driving wheels and four trailing trucks to support the firebox and cab. This was all built on a rigid frame (contrary to an articulated frame such as those used on Mallets) which reduced weight and allowed for leeway in designing and proportioning of cylinders and driving-hardware.  Built to haul high speed passenger trains over the PRR's mainline, the T1's outer shell was designed by Raymond Loewy; one of the most famous industrial designers ever. The T1 was built during a time when passenger train travel was near its highest point, and the need for capable, fast passenger locomotives by all railroads led to many different designs by their engineering departments.  The T1 hoped to replace the aging K4 Class Pacific that, at that time, often had to be double-headed in order to keep trains on time. The rigid framed lighter-weight Duplex design allowed for higher speeds while also having a substantial tractive effort of about 65000 pounds (The Pennsy's K4s only had a tractive effort of about 45000 pounds).  The T1's were well proportioned machines. They regularly ran at speeds of over 100 MPH despite having a ""recommend operating speed"" of 100 even. About 50 T1s were built solely for the PRR and hauled a majority of the express passenger trains for the railroad from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.  The T1s were known to be quite complex for their day and maintenance was costly and time consuming. The locomotives also had an Achilles heel of sorts: The poppet valves used on the locomotive, which helped precisely time steam injection into the cylinders (thus raising top speeds) were made from relatively fragile metals. Thus, if ran at too high of speeds for too long, these poppet valves could melt and seriously damage the engine.  Another downside to the locomotive was, believe it or not, the tractive effort. Engines with too-high of tractive efforts relative to the types of loads they pull can damage track and rolling stock (such was the case with the Pennsy's own FF1 Class electrics. Engineers of the T1 often times applied too much power to get the train moving, which caused the engine's wheels to slip and the engine to lurch forward; damaging couplers and wheel sets as well as track. Also, the excessive horsepower allowed the engines to run at very high speeds (far higher than their recommended 100 MPH). At speeds higher than 100, components on the locomotive (including those poppet valves mentioned earlier) exceeded their engineered capabilities. While designed to be reliable at or below 100, engineers of the T1 were known to run their engines at a far-higher speed to maintain their schedules.  The T1s lived a successful, albeit short life on the PRR. By 1952, The T1s were retired and all of them were sent to the scrappers. Steam was quickly being replaced by economical diesel and electric power, and the T1 with its expensive to maintain parts and limited-usefulness as a passenger-only locomotive made it a vulnerable to being some of the first steam locomotives to be retired.  EDIT: Thanks for the gold stranger!"
MachinePorn,305b8r,exleus,14,Tue Mar 24 17:05:26 2015 UTC,"Amazing! Thanks for the writeup.  It's a really awesome looking machine. Well proportioned and timeless. Its looks remind me of panamax ships too, like they maxed out on the dimensions for length, width, and height for the rails they would be running on and built it just within all those tolerances. I can hardly imagine how things like this were designed before computers too. Did any survive the scrapping?"
MachinePorn,305b8r,UndeadCaesar,15,Tue Mar 24 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately no, all the T1s were scrapped after retirement.

The engines on that plane are much more powerful than the structural integrity of the airframe, so the engines have never been pushed to the max, as the plane starts vibrating too hard and the pilots can't maintain control. Engineering is awesome."

MachinePorn,305b8r,FoodBeerBikesMusic,16,Tue Mar 24 20:45:21 2015 UTC,"Good question! Railroads organized their locomotive types by a series of letters and numbers and sometimes used names as well. This helped identify and classify locomotives. Since there are so many different variables that go into a single type of locomotive (wheel arrangement, boiler size, firebox size, tractive effort, ect.), the many types had to be classified in some way to make it easy to assign locomotives to trains. Since most steam locomotives were custom built for a railroad, the railroad was in charge of creating a classification system that worked for them.  For example, the PRR's E Class was a 4-4-2 locomotive, meaning that it had 4 leading trucks, 4 driving wheels and 2 trailing trucks. These locomotives were used as passenger locomotives because their large driving wheels, light weight, and large firebox made it geared better for fast, light trains. The PRR's J Class was a 2-10-4 heavy freight hauler. The locomotive was designed for heavy drag freights with a low top speed but a very high tractive effort (basically, how much a locomotive can pull). By classifying these locomotives into respective classes based on design, the railroad would be able to make more logical choices in assigning locomotives to trains. You wouldn't assign an E Class to a 100-car coal train just like you wouldn't assign a J Class to an express passenger train."

MachinePorn,305b8r,mynameisalso,2,Tue Mar 24 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"Potentially  novice question here, what are the differences/advantages of a 4-4-4-4 duplex over a 4-8-4 design? Does having  the driving  wheels in two  trucks instead of one make them  able to move faster or something?"
MachinePorn,305b8r,Or1skiny,3,Wed Mar 25 12:15:16 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of variables in designing a steam locomotive. Boiler size, firebox size, wheel size, cylinder size, ect. The advantages of the Duplex design, which utilizes a rigid frame with two sets of drivers is that it saves weight over a traditional articulated type locomotive that is usually used in designing an engine with two sets o drivers. This allows for that extra weight to be either saved or given to other parts of the engine. In the case of the T1, the engine was given smaller, more efficient cylinders for each driver set and lighter drive rods and equipment. This boosts overall top speed and tractive effort.  However another reason it was used is because it just looks good! A symmetrical design that pleases people. It allows for better flow, and overall a more fluid body with the streamlining added.  EDIT: I just thought of this too, which may help a little more. Think of a typical Mountain-type (4-8-2) with two cylinders; one on either side, to drive the driving wheels. Now if you split that into four cylinders and two sets of four driving wheels, you now have a more evenly distributed weight and a more well-balanced drive train. Instead of having all of the tractive force being expelled through just two cylinders, it's now being pushed through four. Ultimately, this helps save on engine wear and even track maintenance costs as well, since the force of the driving rods is being evenly distributed instead of focused on two cylinders.  That's not to say that rigid engines are any less useful! The M1 Mountain was, in my opinion, one of the top 3 best locomotives ever built for the Pennsy. It was as close as you could get to a perfect steam engine, and was utilized in both freight and passenger service with great success."
MachinePorn,305b8r,the_wurd_burd,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that all makes sense, but  is there any particular  advantage to having  a non-articulated duplex? If it's going to  be a rigid frame why have two  sets of driving wheels in a 4-4-4-4 when you can have a 4-8-4? Is there a particular  reason other than just design  aesthetics? Were you  saying  that the two sets of drivers  are lighter than just one?"
MachinePorn,305b8r,vonHindenburg,2,Wed Mar 25 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"It mainly has to do with the motion assembly - when the side rods, main rods and piston rods only have to deal with half the force, they can be a whole lot lighter, and the smaller these difficult-to-balance components are, the smoother everything runs, especially at high speed.

MachinePorn,2zzs23,its_Brad,2,Tue Mar 24 00:27:20 2015 UTC,Why is the exhaust curved like that? Is it to make it so they're all the same length?
MachinePorn,2zzs23,Chadman108,11,Tue Mar 24 02:47:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. Equal length ensures that the turbo is receiving exhaust at all times instead of ""subaru-like""  pulses.

MachinePorn,2zzs23,249ba36000029bbe9749,2,Mon Mar 23 14:56:00 2015 UTC,EL headers are beneficial for nearly everything   Except for practical considerations like cost and space. I know you mean that they are beneficial in a performance sense but wanted to clarify why someone's econobox doesn't have EL exhaust.
MachinePorn,2zzs23,gehzumteufel,6,Mon Mar 23 16:11:22 2015 UTC,but wanted to clarify why someone's econobox doesn't have EL exhaust.   Mazda SkyActiv tech uses equal length headers. In their econoboxes. ;)
MachinePorn,2zzs23,boggiewan,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:28:35 2015 UTC,I don't see how equal length headers would make that much of a difference in a naturally aspirated engine...maybe in a crazy F1-V12 this may make more sense but I doubt much can be achieved.  I can only see EL being useful when you have an unequal amount of cylinder banks : turbos.  That's when exhaust pulse variance would become an issue.  Non?
MachinePorn,2zzs23,0generic0throwaway0,4,Mon Mar 23 21:07:17 2015 UTC,"Exhaust systems are actually extremely complex systems, so I'll just cut right to the chase. Equal length headers, even on a NA car, will cause each exhaust pulse to ""pull"" the next pulse out of the engine and the remaining exhaust system. This leads to better exhaust flow, as well as cleaner air in the cylinder."
MachinePorn,2zzs23,gehzumteufel,2,Mon Mar 23 19:17:46 2015 UTC,It is definitely beneficial for NA motors. Exhaust pulses are there no matter the cylinder count. Mazda's SkyActiv tech uses exactly this technique to get efficiency gains on turbo and NA alike. And most of their motors are 4cyl or smaller.
MachinePorn,2zzs23,fiah84,2,Mon Mar 23 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"a NA engine benefits a lot from exhaust scavenging, where the under-pressure left after the exhaust pulse from the previous cylinder helps pull (scavenge) the exhaust out of the next cylinder, plus extra intake charge. Tuning your exhaust headers so that this effect peaks at a certain RPM means that you'll get more exhaust out of and more intake charge into your cylinders at that RPM, increasing power. That is also why almost all engines merge all exhausts into one pipe sooner or later, even if the exhaust is then split again. Or instead of that, sometimes little pipes are used between exhaust header to achieve the same effect, these are called  balance pipes and are often seen on motorcycles"

MachinePorn,2zuojy,dakboy,18,Sun Mar 22 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"Close.  Swept wings delay the formation of normal shocks and allow for less drag at supersonic speeds. The Tomcat's wings could sweep back under computer control to a maximum of 68 degrees in flight. When on the deck of a carrier, the wings could be commanded to sweep all the way to 75 degrees to minimize the deck space the jet occupied."

MachinePorn,2zuojy,oberon,24,Sun Mar 22 05:44:51 2015 UTC,"It was given commands as to what to do, rather than having someone fly it directly.  The on-board computers did the flying part.  If you look in the videos the lights change from green to blue; that is the point that it's handed off from the guy on the deck, who is lining it up on the catapult himself, to the tower, who then issue a command to take off.  They were certainly monitoring it very closely, and probably had the option to do so, but it didn't have a guy with a joystick directly controlling it.  The landing, in particular, was a milestone because it had never been done before."
MachinePorn,2zuojy,onacho,2,Sun Mar 22 05:54:55 2015 UTC,"That's all well and good, but... I've worked with UAVs (launched and landed on solid ground, not a carrier) and we've had this sort of autonomous landing for a while now.  There's a combination of a few radio transmitters, receivers, and transceivers that guide the aircraft into a touchdown at the center of the landing strip, and a tail hook snags a pendulum across the runway that stops the aircraft.  It's basically the same system used on a carrier, only cheaper and sorta lame because we're just landing little UAVs and not kickass jets.  So is there something about landing on a carrier that makes this task harder?"
MachinePorn,2zuojy,oberon,28,Sun Mar 22 06:38:20 2015 UTC,"The carrier is pitching and rolling, and moving at 30 knots at the same time.  There is a localized GPS system that increases the accuracy to the point where it can be used for this sort of thing.  Still additionally, landings have to be done at relatively precise airspeeds and sink rates; a little too fast and you'll snap the wires, a little too much sink and you'll break the landing gear.  Their requirements are also to land in all weather, day or night."
MachinePorn,2zuojy,onacho,2,Sun Mar 22 06:50:01 2015 UTC,"I was in the military, so we had the good kind of GPS too, although that only got the aircraft into the general neighborhood; once it was acquired by the TALS (TUAV Automated Landing System) then that took over.  Here's a bit of advertising copy with a few useful technical details: http://www.sncorp.com/pdfs/BusinessAreas/TALS%20Product%20Sheet.pdf  We never once had any problems, and the airspeed and slope requirements are the same on land as they are on a flight deck.  Well, okay no, I should say that there are airspeed and slope requirements on land just as there are on a flight deck; obviously they vary with the type of aircraft, length of the runway, etc.  I'm guessing the big differences are more related to the fact that it's a different system and they just hadn't put the pieces together in working order before, rather than that an automated landing had never been accomplished before ever."
MachinePorn,2zuojy,oberon,13,Sun Mar 22 07:03:52 2015 UTC,The GPS system isn't more accurate because they're using the encrypted military system but because they have a local base station broadcasting a differential gps signal that lets you get accuracy in the range of centimeters or millimeters.

And, again, the carrier is moving. They did this in very nice weather, but I would expect that the X-47 will be able to land in very high sea states, and so the autonomous landing system will have to deal with the carrier moving by quite a bit."
MachinePorn,2zuojy,misunderstandgap,2,Mon Mar 23 01:53:00 2015 UTC,"Right, and the carrier moving makes it very difficult for a human being to get right.  But once you've got an automated landing system in place, you should be able to account for a moving target without too much trouble.  Reaction time is much quicker for computers than it is for humans."
MachinePorn,2zuojy,oberon,3,Mon Mar 23 02:32:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""without much trouble."" A drone landing on a runway only has to deal with the movement of the drone, which is a low-latency connection. Landing on a carrier required the pitch, roll and yaw of the deck to be transmitted to the drone, which is a higher latency loop, and a much more dynamic landing environment.  And I wouldn't knock the human brain--using our eyeballs to navigate a complex 3d environment is what primate brains are best at."
MachinePorn,2zuojy,misunderstandgap,2,Mon Mar 23 02:41:41 2015 UTC,"I was commenting more about the speed of electronics, in terms of a signal-process-response cycle (i.e. you see something and then react to it) compared to the human brain.

You will never be as fast as a sensor->logic feedback loop. Your eyes will never be as precise as differential GPS. If you're broadcasting pitch, roll, and yaw of the deck with no acknowledgement from the drone required, the drone can make corrections in hundreds of milliseconds."

In the 1200 mile case, it means fly 600 miles out, do something, then fly back.  The ""something"" could be drop a bomb on a target, stay on station for a period of time, or conduct reconnaissance on a target.  The range requirement is very difficult...to the point that they are considering aircraft as large as the F-14 to fulfill it.  In typical military style, the mission and requirements have been all over the place, which doesn't help things.

MachinePorn,2zq4dh,RyanSmith,16,Fri Mar 20 18:20:45 2015 UTC,What is this vessel's purpose?
MachinePorn,2zq4dh,ziatonic,40,Fri Mar 20 20:09:44 2015 UTC,To carry liquified natural gas across the oceans at -162 degrees celsius.
MachinePorn,2zq4dh,ytokes,60,Fri Mar 20 20:16:34 2015 UTC,"A typical cargo cycle starts with the tanks in a ""gas free"" condition, meaning the tanks are full of air, which allows maintenance on the tank and pumps. Cargo cannot be loaded directly into the tank, as the presence of oxygen would create an explosive atmospheric condition within the tank, and the rapid temperature change caused by loading LNG at −162 °C could damage the tanks.  First, the tank must be 'inerted' to eliminate the risk of explosion. An inert gas plant burns diesel in air to produce carbon dioxide (CO2); this is blown into the tanks until the oxygen level is below 4%.  Next, the vessel goes into port to ""gas-up"" and ""cool-down"", as one still cannot load directly into the tank: The CO2 will freeze and damage the pumps and the cold shock could damage the tank's pump column.  Liquid LNG is brought onto the vessel and taken along the spray line to the main vaporiser, which boils off the liquid into gas. This is then warmed up to roughly 20 °C in the gas heaters and then blown into the tanks to displace the ""inert gas"". This continues until all the CO2 is removed from the tanks. Initially, the IG (inert gas) is vented to atmosphere. Once the hydrocarbon content reaches 5% (lower flamability range of methane) the inert gas is redirected to shore via a pipeline and manifold connection by the HD (high duty) compressors. The shore terminal then burns this vapour to avoid the dangers of having large amounts of hydrocarbons around which may explode.  Now the vessel is gassed up and warm. The tanks are still at ambient temperature and are full of methane.  The next stage is cool-down. Liquid LNG is sprayed into the tanks via spray heads, which vaporises and starts to cool the tank. The excess gas is again blown ashore to be re-liquified or burned at a flare stack. Once the tanks reach about −140 °C the tanks are ready to load bulk.  Bulk loading starts and liquid LNG is pumped from the storage tanks ashore into the vessel tanks. Displaced gas is blown ashore by the HD compressors. Loading continues until typically 98.5% full is reached (to allow for thermal expansion/contraction of cargo).  The vessel can now proceed to the discharge port. During passage various boil-off management strategies can be used. Boil-off gas can be burned in boilers to provide steam for propulsion, or it can be re-liquefied and returned to the cargo tanks, depending on the design of the vessel.  Once in the discharge port, the cargo is pumped ashore using the cargo pumps. As the tank empties, the vapour space is filled by either gas from ashore or by vaporising some cargo in the cargo vaporiser. Either the vessel can be pumped out as far as possible, with the last being pumped out with spray pumps, or some cargo can be retained on board as a ""heel"".  If all the cargo is pumped ashore, then on the ballast passage the tanks will warm up to ambient temperature, returning the vessel to a gassed up and warm state. The vessel can then be cooled again for loading.  If the vessel is to return to a gas free state, the tanks must be warmed up by using the gas heaters to circulate warm gas. Once the tanks are warmed up, the inert gas plant is used to remove the methane from the tanks. Once the tanks are methane free, the inert gas plant is switched to dry air production, which is used to remove all the inert gas from the tanks until they have a safe working atmosphere.   This prompted me to find this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG_carrier#Typical_cargo_cycle"
MachinePorn,2zq4dh,CheezyArmpit,14,Fri Mar 20 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"I used to work with liquid nitrogen pumps and tankers all the time. Very very similar process with liquid nitrogen as liquefied natural gas.  The article makes the process sound very complicated but it really isn't all that bad, it's just loading product into the tanks the first time around which is the difficult portion. Most likely what they'll do instead of constantly purging the tanks to take them from ambient temperature to -162 is to keep a little bit in the tanks when the tanker is ""empty"" (this was stated in the article as keeping some on board as a ""heel""), we usually kept 5-10% tank volume in our nitrogen tanks. This way the tank is consistently at its proper temperature and i'm assuming since the vessle is partially powered by the nitrogen gas that some of the boil-off vapor can be used to power the ship back to its loading port. This way is far more efficient (in the nitrogen world) than constantly having product boiling off when initally cooling down the tank and equipment."

MachinePorn,2zq4dh,flattop100,8,Fri Mar 20 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"Marine gas turbines are for anyone that can afford them.  That said, primarily navy. They have fantastic power/weight ratio - this is why they're great on aircraft - they develop a fucktonne of power from a very compact, lightweight machinery package.   The price paid for that is poor fuel efficiency, especially at less than 100% load. They drink fuel at idle condition.   So let's say you need to make 1000kW of power A marine diesel will be:   large heavy very fuel efficient at a range of operating speeds   Whereas a gas turbine will be:   small light very fuel inefficient, especially if you need to vary the throttle off 100% design load   Naval vessels tend to value speed and light weight over fuel efficiency, whereas merchant shipping is only profitable if they spend as little on oil as they possibly can. So that dictates the choices.  That said, you see a range of interesting hybrid options like diesel-electric for modern shipping. The propellers are driven by electric motors and, depending on how much speed is required, the varying power demand is met by diesel generators alone or additional gas turbine power kicks in for an occasional speed boost. Many cruise ships work like that. The same engines generating propulsion power share the hotel loads (all the electricity needed elsewhere on a ship). This is similar to the national power grid generation philosophy of 'baseload' and 'peaker' plants.  Some other vessels even have mechanical hybrid drive (technically called parallel hybrid). One propeller is linked to two engines - one efficient diesel for low-speed work, one gas turbine that kicks in so they can work together for fast sprints. As you can imagine, the gearbox to do this is expensive and complicated, but this is how something like a coastguard patrol vessel works efficiently - long, boring cruising at 10-12kts punctuated by occasional pursuits at 35kts+.

MachinePorn,2znwpt,249ba36000029bbe9749,1 point,Sat Mar 21 14:10:20 2015 UTC,"Right. First: what everyone is saying is correct. When this project was initiated, they asked for an engine with, say, 12,000 lbs of thrust. After the engine was designed and built, testing revealed that they had sufficient safe margin to get up to 15,000 lbs. Not wanting to go back and rewrite the whole spec, they rate excess power as percent over 100 - this is common. To your point though, if they think there's a case where the engine might be asked to do more than 100% (and it would be an emergency, or some situation where more than 100% is the difference between a loss of vehicle and crew) then you bet your ass they'll test the engine at that point and harder."

The 100% level does not mean the maximum physical power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date."""

MachinePorn,2znwpt,popstar249,16,Fri Mar 20 05:52:56 2015 UTC,"Best answer from there:   100% is usually the power level where the turbo-machines operate at their design flow and pressure (head), which means they operate at maximum efficiency.  At launch it is often favorable to go above this value to reduce gravity losses. Although the turbo-machinery does not work at peak efficiency, the specific impulse may actually increase as well because running at a higher chamber pressure lessens the over-expansion in the nozzle at sea level.  Small glossary:  Chamber pressure: The pressure in the combustion chamber.  over-expansion: Because of the lessening atmosphere along the rocket's path, the nozzle is only perfect at one point of the mission. At launch it is too big, and at altitude it is too small.  Specific impulse: Kind of a fuel efficiency of the engine.  Turbo-machinery: The pumps that are used to feed the propellants into the combustion chamber."

The Baldwin Locomotive Works built the only XA and wheels-for-wheels, was the largest locomotive wheel arrangement ever built. Locomotives with three sets of driving wheels were known as Triplexes and were ran in the United States by the Virginian Railroad and Erie Railroad.  A little background on the railroad that ordered it: The Virginian Railroad was built around the turn of the 20th century to haul high-quality coal from the plentiful coal fields of West Virginia to ports in Virginia. It was blessed with a solid demand for their main cargo, quality, family-run management and many profitable years during both World Wars. As a result, the VGN was always ahead of the curve as far as railroading technology and innovations.   The XA class was no exception. The VGN needed locomotives that would assist in moving drag freights (low speed, high tonnage shipments, usually of one type of cargo) consisting of coal hoppers over the mainline. Up until then, the Virginian double-headed and sometimes triple-headed locomotives to achieve this task (imagine the noise!). More often than not, locomotives would also be strapped to the rear of the train as well for additional horsepower. The XA hoped to help eliminate this. Built mainly as an experiment, the VGN hoped to improve on the XA and create a suitable locomotive for the task at hand over time.  Unfortunately, the XA was prone to a variety of problems. For starters, while the locomotive generated a huge amount of horsepower, it had a top speed of five miles per hour. The massive locomotive's boiler could not generate enough steam to keep it moving above that speed. As a comparison, the Pennsylvania Railroad during this time used it's famous I1 ""Decapod"" Class 2-10-0s for similar low-speed work and was operated at a sustained speed of about 20 MPH.  Another problem with the XA's was what was known as ""variable traction"". The rear-most set of drivers sat under the tender of the locomotive. As the locomotive burned fuel and consumed water, the tender obviously got lighter and lighter. This is a problem in that the weight on the drivers also became less and less, reducing the friction between the wheels and the rails and making those sets of drivers prone to slipping.   The VGN gave it their best shot, but Triplexes just weren't feasible. After about three years in 1920, the VGN returned their Triplex to Baldwin who split the locomotive into a Mallet-type 2-8-8-0 and a Consolidation-type 2-8-0."

MachinePorn,2zkxfi,gsfgf,3,Thu Mar 19 13:53:29 2015 UTC,"double-headed and sometimes triple-headed locomotives   Am I correct that that was insanely complicated with steam locomotives, unlike modern diesel electrics where it's routine?"
MachinePorn,2zkxfi,tomparker,5,Fri Mar 20 04:03:44 2015 UTC,"Very! You had to have a separate crew for each locomotive all operating in unison with each other to ensure smooth operation. If I'm not mistaken, that includes an engineer, fireman and at least one brakeman per locomotive. While this was also the case for some early diesel and electric locomotives and is still practiced in some cases today (such as when helper locomotives are attached to the ends of trains to help them over steep grades), steam locomotives were an especially unique case.   Communication between cabs would have had to have been done with whistle and hand signals before the days of two-way radio."

MachinePorn,2zkxfi,VolvoKoloradikal,53,Sat Mar 21 00:17:41 2015 UTC,"The key to the high horsepower steam locomotive was hidden in the boiler. Heating surface, high pressure, superheat. This all culminated in the 1940s with the Lima H-8 2-6-6-6 ""Allegheny"". They were the heaviest steam locomotives ever built, and among the most powerful, developing around 8,000 HP.   While the XA could pull coal drag in 1916 at 5 MPH, the H-8 could pull the same train at 50 in 1946. The secret was the boiler."
MachinePorn,2zkxfi,VolvoKoloradikal,26,Thu Mar 19 13:48:28 2015 UTC,The H-8s are one of my favorite locomotives ever. They were just...massive. Any steam engine that can haul 90 loaded hoppers at 50 MPH certainly must have some power under the hood. My favorite part of the Alleghenies was the 6-wheel trailing truck. For when you absolutely need a firebox the size of a house
MachinePorn,2zkxfi,cybercuzco,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:53:20 2015 UTC,Is there anything steam locomotives are better than their electric and diesel brethren? Why did they get phased out?
MachinePorn,2zkxfi,249ba36000029bbe9749,2,Sat Mar 21 00:19:39 2015 UTC,"One thing for sure: they're very labor intensive. it takes hours to get a locomotive up and running from a cold start (i.e. after maintenance, if the fire had to be dumped for any reason) whereas a diesel locomotive starts up with a couple of minor things and a push of a button.  Also, diesels are inherently safer. You dont have a giant tube of boiling water in front of you at all times, compared to a humming diesel-electric system with (later on) onboard fire extinguishing systems.  Finally, diesels and electric locomotives are much cheaper to maintain. Parts for steam locomotives have to be cast in special molds and whatnot. Diesel and electric systems are built on a series of many parts that are able to be made many times over, quickly and easily. This is a guess on my part, as I really don't know the true economics of steam locomotives v/s diesels v/s electrics"

MachinePorn,2zkxfi,Asmallfly,4,Thu Mar 19 15:55:47 2015 UTC,The secret was the boiler.   Go on...
MachinePorn,2zkxfi,KargBartok,16,Thu Mar 19 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"The job of the fireman was to ensure that there was max pressure available at all times, as that is when it was most efficient.  They basically tried to run steam engines full bore, and control the speed with the brake.    It was a risky endeavour at times; trying to keep the water level just right as to not cool the boiler too much, but also not dry it out and cause a melt down.   One old head, who had the chance to pilot a steam engine, told me that more men have walked on the moon than have survived locomotive boiler explosions."
MachinePorn,2zkxfi,VolvoKoloradikal,2,Thu Mar 19 19:29:31 2015 UTC,"So was the boiler ""tech"" the same, but they were just running it closer to the limit?"
MachinePorn,2zkxfi,jazzyt98,8,Thu Mar 19 22:43:34 2015 UTC,"As a basic pressure vessel the idea was the same. The big change was ""superpower"". This involved optimizing the ratio of heating surface (steam capacity) to cylinder volume (steam consumption). Optimizing this ratio meant increasing the grate size of the fire box--the square footage of the fire--, raising the pressure (300 PSI steam is more than twice as good as 150 PSI steam), and superheat--heating the saturated steam again so that it becomes dry and absorbs even more thermal energy. Advances in thermodynamic understanding and material science (the strength of the steel used in the boiler) allowed for the huge advances in steam power in the 1930s and 1940s.   Advanced steam locomotives like the H-8, the FEF, and the Niagara developed high torque (mean effective pressure on the piston) at high speed. If you remember your physics, power = torque x speed. High torque at high speed means lots of power. Power enough to pull a mile long coal train at 50 MPH."

Also in general the boilers were larger in diameter.   edit- also the later boilers could run at higher pressures, resulting in more power."

MachinePorn,2zkxfi,djwork,9,Fri Mar 20 01:38:34 2015 UTC,"Great question! The H-8 weighed more than the Big-Boy, but was shorter, and had fewer powered axles. It also had a smaller calculated tractive effort than the Big Boy. Its firebox and grate area was larger however, and it developed more horsepower than the Big Boys did. The H-8s and Big Boys were both superlative locomotives built for similar purposes--hauling huge heavy freight trains with a single locomotive without helpers. The H-8s hauled coal from the mines to Roanoke, VA and the Big Boys hauled fast freight over the Wasatch Mountains in Utah."

However reverse thrust on prop planes doesn't work like that. Thrust reversing is acomplished by decreasing the propellers pitch until it is negative while maintaining the rotational direction.   On a normal assymetrical propeller blade profile reversing the rotational direction is pretty useless and probably not even worth the little trouble you have to go through doing that with an electric motor."

The rotor is missing, and it's the rotor that allows you to tell whether it's an induction, wound-field synchronous, or permanent magnet synchronous motor. Three-phase stators can look the same for all of these!

MachinePorn,2zfnmk,Sobertese,3,Wed Mar 18 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"Plumbing/heating guy here - I replace loads of electric motors, fans, water pumps, synchron actuators, I've always wondered what has actually caused them to stop working? Is it normally a fault with the windings or is it the bearings that go? Same for solenoids really - I can't get my head round what is physically going on inside to stop them working. I hate being just a fitter, I'd love to understand more about how these things work and their fault conditions."
MachinePorn,2zfnmk,reynolds753,3,Wed Mar 18 15:39:26 2015 UTC,"In the applications you're talking about, I'm guessing that the motor itself is probably in perfect condition when you replace it. HVAC applications don't have a lot of the kind of stress that would fail a motor--coolant leaks, off-axis forces, that kind of thing. Even with a current spike, the electronic circuit that drives the motor will almost always fail before the windings get hot enough to melt or the rotor deforms. In some types of motors, there's a position sensor inside the motor housing, which is necessary to control the motor. That sensor is often the cause of failure, since it's much less robust than the motor. You'd see that type of failure often on synchronous machines, or anything with torque control, but likely not as often on a fan or pump drive.  In short, in HVAC (and most other applications) it's the power electronics and sensors that usually fail long before the motor, and that's usually due to heat--either because of repetitive temperature cycling, or instantaneous power spikes, or a problem with the cooling system."
MachinePorn,2zfnmk,Liebonaut,2,Wed Mar 18 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"dunno about real world stuff, but vibration can be a major killer for a ton of motors.  If you're unlucky and the motor is cheap, the field windings (visible in the post) can rub against something, and eventually short circuit, causing the motor to suddenly consume more current and burn the epoxy coating on the wires, which are only good to 100-120C.  Better motors will dip the entire wire assembly in epoxy, making them quite durable.    A poorly cooled motor can eventually get hot enough to do the same kind of thing.  Heat or heat cycling (expansion and contraction) will eventually break down the epoxy, and make it powder away.  Corrosion of the steel is possible in wet environments, which will gradually increase the current consumption, but before thats noticeable it will clog up the motor with rust particles.  Often moisture will also cause the bearings to fail before anything else though, even sealed bearings.    All of those things are trivial to design around, but since electric motors can take huge amounts of abuse and run basically forever (they are essentially huge heat reservoirs, and even crappy motors can exert double power for short times), you can easily afford to not give a shit about whats around it.  Well made and well placed motors can often run almost continuously until their surroundings degrade or their bearings cheese."

MachinePorn,2ywjzn,texasroadkill,0,Mon Mar 23 14:43:19 2015 UTC,"An excerpt from the book ""Sled Driver"" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:   There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.  It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.  I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.  We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.  Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.  Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.  Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.  ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""  For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

As the specks grew to dots and the dots grew to spots, radio reports started coming through and it became certain the ordeal wasn't over. There were dead and dying men on board half a dozen of the group's bombers. There was a frantic call from one radio operator. The ball-turret gunner was trapped in the plastic bubble hanging beneath the B-17. The gears that rotated the ball to put the gunner in position to shoot and then returned him to the position that enabled him to climb out and back up into the aircraft had been hit and were jammed. The ball-turret gunner was caught in a plastic cage.  Two of the engines of the B-17 were stopped, about 3,000 pounds of dead weight hanging from the wings. The plane was losing altitude fast and flying at barely 135 miles an hour, close to stall-out speed. The pilot ordered the crew to unload everything on board.  ""Everything!"" he yelled in a command that reached the control tower over the radioman's open microphone. The crew started pitching out machine guns, .50-caliber ammunition tracks, oxygen tanks, and every instrument they could tear loose in an attempt to lighten the load and keep the foundering plane in the air. The hydraulic system was spewing fluid where the tubing that conveyed it was shot full of holes. The gas tanks were leaking. Nothing worked. The wheels, folded up into the bomber, could not be brought down without its hydraulic system and a belly landing was inevitable.  There were eight minutes of gut-wrenching talk among the tower, the pilot, and the man trapped in the ball turret. He knew what comes down first when there are no wheels. We all watched in horror as it happened. We watched as this man's life ended, mashed between the concrete pavement of the runway and the belly of the bomber.   And the comment about the ball breaking the fuselage: http://www.reddit.com/r/MachinePorn/comments/2yelxy/tailgunners_768x960/cp914ee   Disturbing article, so I read up on the situation. It appears this account is from Andy Rooney. I found a reference to it in this thread http://www.ww2aircraft.net/forum/aviation/options-save-trapped-ball-turret-gunner-bomber-wheels-landing-32802.html[1] . Most of the concensus (from at least one guy still flying B17s) is that the ball is quite strong and the belief is that it would either push up inside the fuselage or crack the plane in half in the scenario.

To this day, I can't believe how tiny is the inside of that ball.  When seated properly in position, the M2's are actually just a few inches away to the left and right of the gunner's face.  How anybody could fight a war from inside one of those things is unfathomable.  So here you are - the smallest man of the crew - inside a tiny metal ball hanging under a multi-ton aircraft.  Alone.  With a pair of 50-cal machine guns going off inches from your head while the plane flies along at well over 200 MPH some 7 or more miles in the air.  And all this at temperatures of about -40F while enemy aircraft take potshots at you with their own  machine guns and 20mm cannons.  Sounds . . . interesting, don't it?

Hydraulic backhoes started as small machines that couldn't replace traditional cable driven excavators in most of their uses, but were cheaper and more convenient for some tasks. Backhoes evolved and gradually took more and more work from cable excavators, until only the absolutely biggest machines were cable driven excavators.  This picture here seems to be the ultimate refuge of cable driven excavators."

Are you saying that originally hydraulic backhoes were less efficient machines, but more affordable, therefore people used them more, leading to increased development, which made them more powerful? And that if that same research has been dedicated to cable driven excavators the machines would have been better than the backhoes we have today? Is the dealings that engineers were forced to develop clearly less powerful machines simply because the market was more comfortable with hydraulic backhoes?"
MachinePorn,2yq4jk,MasterFubar,2,Thu Mar 12 04:43:13 2015 UTC,"Hydraulic backhoes were more expensive and had smaller capacity, but they were more compact. When swimming pools became fashionable during the 1950s, backhoes could fit into the typical suburban backyard where regular excavators didn't.  From that niche market they started expanding into other segments. As their experience grew, companies started making bigger hydraulic backhoes, until these days when only the extreme size machines, like in the photo OP posted, are cable driven."

MachinePorn,2yq84c,Dopeaz,25,Thu Mar 12 20:44:28 2015 UTC,Am I crazy or are those gears on the end different sizes? How could a screw compressor possibly work with a speed differential between the screws?
MachinePorn,2yq84c,Soonermandan,12,Thu Mar 12 00:37:08 2015 UTC,The gears are indeed two different sizes. If you look closer at the screws you will see that they are not identical.
MachinePorn,2yq84c,DYLDOLEE,14,Thu Mar 12 00:48:07 2015 UTC,"That shouldn't matter, should it? If they're running at different speeds they will interfere and crash. I'm imagining if they weren't connected by the gears and one was completely stationary. You wouldn't be able to turn the other one.   Edit: Think I got it. Not only are the screws different shapes, they're different diameters. So the shaft speeds are different, but at the mating point between the two screws there is no speed differential and they mate perfectly. RPM doesn't matter here, tip velocity does. It appears that the mating line between the two is slightly above center as well, which would confirm that the screw on the bottom is in fact bigger. Is that right?"
MachinePorn,2yq84c,Soonermandan,11,Thu Mar 12 00:56:15 2015 UTC,The screws probably have a different number of teeth. This ratio works just like normal gears.
MachinePorn,2yq84c,MobiusBacon,3,Thu Mar 12 01:05:51 2015 UTC,"This is whats going on, the upper screw has perhaps 4 teeth/flutes.  The bottom one looks to have at least 5-6 flutes."

MachinePorn,2yq84c,tallyrand,3,Thu Mar 12 00:56:29 2015 UTC,"Are the gears on the right actually for power transmission? It looks like the amount of force these rotors would exert on the gas, would strain those little gears pretty hard.  It's my guess that two motors drive this thing, one to each rotor, and the gears on the right are just there to maintain precise synchronization. In my mind, this would be more efficient, too, because you wouldn't lose energy heating up the gear oil under heavy load."

MachinePorn,2yq84c,tallyrand,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yup the inner diameter of each screw corresponds the the sides of the gear, and thus the ratio of speeds needed to maintain a mesh of the screw threads.  Thinking of how two rollers (the inner parts of each screw) would need to be geared to maintain the right rolling speeds should help people understanding what's going on here."

The rotors are the same outer diameter, but have different numbers of ""teeth"" (4 at the top, 5 at the bottom) so they turn at different rates to make the same number of teeth pass each other in the middle.  This doesn't make any sense with regular gears as 4:5 with the same diameter wouldn't mesh, but these teeth are a very weird shape. I wish I knew the term for it."
MachinePorn,2yq84c,OllyFunkster,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:11:40 2015 UTC,"Those are helical gears.  They are quieter, and have better torque transfer properties. They are pretty gear-ate too."
MachinePorn,2yq84c,exodeju,2,Thu Mar 12 18:40:35 2015 UTC,The helical gears also allow adjustment of the relative angle of the rotors.  One gear can be shimmed a bit axially to gain or lose clearance between lobes of the two screws.

MachinePorn,2yq84c,titsmuhgeee,7,Thu Mar 12 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"It is a closed loop system. Air goes in the compressor inlet, the compressor outlet air flows to the back of a large natural gas burner and ignited. That hot air then goes through the turbine. So basically the compressor feeds the turbine with the help of natural gas.  Before we had the closed loop system, we used surplus military jet engines to power the turbine as an open loop system."

The driving of both shafts is done by the gear set on the right hand side and the precision ground screws are still able to produce massive air flow. Dry screws are ideal for applications where the compressed air cannot be contaminated by things like lubricating oil."
MachinePorn,2yq84c,MasterFubar,4,Thu Mar 12 00:41:01 2015 UTC,"Yes - short story is they create sealed ""pockets"" between themselves and the compressor wall. At the end the volume of that pocket decreases, so the gas inside compresses and goes out the other end."

MachinePorn,2yh7ay,AnalInferno,-3,Tue Mar 10 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really make sense to compare an inline engine to a V engine in that respect. V engines benefit from two banks of cylinders sharing the same crankcase and crankshaft, this makes their power to weight ratios hard to beat. There aren't any aluminum OHV 4 cylinders I can think of to compare either. My point was that there are plenty of OHV and DOHC V engines that can be compared.  Porsche's 918 engine makes 608 hp and weighs less than 300 pounds. Lamborghini's Aventador engine makes more power than any mass production (edit: naturally aspirated, I think only one boosted V8 beats it) pushrod engine has ever made and has a better power to weight ratio than the LS7. Ferrari's F140 engine makes nearly 800 hp in the LaFerrari and probably weighs less than the Aventador engine. The Carrera GT engine and the Ferrari F50 engine both have better power to weight ratios than the LS7.   If you want to get into racing engines, things get even more nuts. This engine is capable of making 450 hp. The F1 V10s of the early 2000s were capable of making 925 hp and only weighed 203 pounds. Indy and ALMS engines are also likely to be very compact and lightweight for the amount of power that they make.    Not that it's a good measurement of anything.   I'm not sure what you mean by that. Power to weight ratio determines how well a vehicle will perform."
MachinePorn,2yh7ay,diesel_stinks_,3,Tue Mar 10 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"All of the engines you mentioned are engineering marvels for sure, but you didn't give a counterweight on the OHV side. Is there a OHV engine that even tries to compete with the supercar motors you mentioned? GCT vs LS7 is ridiculous. The fact remains that without the giant head assemblies and with only a single (ish) cam, OHV motors are simpler, have lower mechanical losses, and are much more compact. No, they can not rev as high and are thus not nearly as fun, but they do put down the power.   I am not a booster for OHV motors - my own car has a 4.2L 40-valve DOHC V8 with a 7600RPM fuel cutoff. I will say it's embarrassing when I pull up to my friends Z06 from the same era though. His motor is TINY in comparison and dyno'ed at 520 at the wheels stock. With code, cam, headers and an intake, he's near 600HP at the wheels now. Yes, it also sounds loud, but it's a lot quieter than a CGT from (again) the same era. A lot of these numbers are constrained by what the mfgrs are willing to deal with in terms of passenger-pain-level.  And yes, i am in complete agreement that for peak horsepower vs displacement with the tech we have now, DOHC is the state of the art. That said, OHV serves a purpose of providing high horsepower for the space and weight given and nothing you mentioned above discredits that."

Edit: I made these charts a while back, I think that they better show what that Allpar link is trying to explain.   So what about simpler...   Negative. OHC engines accomplish the same task with far fewer parts.   Parts between the cam and the valves:  OHV 8 valve 4 cylinder: 8 tappets, 8 pushrods, 8 rocker arms.   OHC 8 valve 4 cylinder: 8 tappets.  Even if you double the number of valves and go to DOHC there will only be a few more parts in the OHC engine.    ...cheaper...    Yes.   ...and smaller?

Horsepower is a function of torque combined with speed. So no, horsepower doesn't do anything.  You also forgot the complicated timing system required for DOHC engines and the sheer amount of sensors required to keep that shit working right. Here's the LS version of that.  They are definitely not cheaper, a turnkey LS7 can be had for a smidgen over $13k. The Audi/Lambo 5.2L V10 long-block has an MSRP of $18500. I can't imagine it's V12 brother being any cheaper.   I do have proof of their reliability. I'm actually in the automotive trade, I happen to have friends who work on high end vehicles, and timing tensioners and other DOHC related parts do cause a lot of issues.

MachinePorn,2yh7ay,StupidRobot,2,Tue Mar 10 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"Not entirely. Gm asked Lotus to design a top end around their existing small Block v8. When Lotus came back to Gm with a larger bore engine Gm said ""nope, if must have the same cylinder bore as our existing 350"". It was a joint effort."
MachinePorn,2yh7ay,kurtis1,3,Tue Mar 10 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"Although GM asked lotus to design the engine (GM owned lotus at the time) the motor does not share any major components with the GM small block V8. I believe that the GM small block had a bore of 4.0"" to 4.125"" at the time and the first year of the the LT-5 motor had a bore of 4.4"".

As the specks grew to dots and the dots grew to spots, radio reports started coming through and it became certain the ordeal wasn't over. There were dead and dying men on board half a dozen of the group's bombers. There was a frantic call from one radio operator. The ball-turret gunner was trapped in the plastic bubble hanging beneath the B-17. The gears that rotated the ball to put the gunner in position to shoot and then returned him to the position that enabled him to climb out and back up into the aircraft had been hit and were jammed. The ball-turret gunner was caught in a plastic cage.  Two of the engines of the B-17 were stopped, about 3,000 pounds of dead weight hanging from the wings. The plane was losing altitude fast and flying at barely 135 miles an hour, close to stall-out speed. The pilot ordered the crew to unload everything on board.  ""Everything!"" he yelled in a command that reached the control tower over the radioman's open microphone. The crew started pitching out machine guns, .50-caliber ammunition tracks, oxygen tanks, and every instrument they could tear loose in an attempt to lighten the load and keep the foundering plane in the air.  The hydraulic system was spewing fluid where the tubing that conveyed it was shot full of holes. The gas tanks were leaking. Nothing worked. The wheels, folded up into the bomber, could not be brought down without its hydraulic system and a belly landing was inevitable.  There were eight minutes of gut-wrenching talk among the tower, the pilot, and the man trapped in the ball turret. He knew what comes down first when there are no wheels. We all watched in horror as it happened. We watched as this man's life ended, mashed between the concrete pavement of the runway and the belly of the bomber."

Frome here:   The main gear retracts into the nacelles behind the inboard engines. Electrically operated retraction units, with auxiliary manual systems, are used for raising and lowering the main wheels. The emergency hand crank connections for operating the main landing gear are at the forward end of the bomb bay on each side of the doorway leading to the cockpit."

Here it looks like they were practicing for splashdown after the mission (the capsule lands in the ocean, then they get out and are picked up by a boat).  I am not sure of the boot specifics but these are the type they would have worn in space at this point in time. If an astronaut was going to leave the spacecraft the boot would be pressurized, but I don't believe any 'spacewalks' (called EVA or Extra-Vehicular Activity) were scheduled for Apollo 1. Ed White (closest to us in the picture) was the first American to ever do an EVA.  By the time we were walking on the moon the boots were different, as were the space suits in general—these resemble the Gemini space suits more than the later Apollo ones that are more well known. Part of this redesign was cause by the Apollo 1 tragedy and the suits were better fireproofed. The capsule in general was also redesigned to correct several safety issues."

The exhaust alone produces 300 lbs of thrust from the stack. The guy reckons he could fly the plane by that alone, which I think is a bit of a stretch.  The wings are less than 3 inches thick at their thickest point too, which is bragable considering they house the cooling system for the engine, which is just a bunch of pipes immersed in water that uses the wing surface itself as a heat exchanger.

They also aren't set up for aerobatics with a 400HP V8 engine like this is.  On the other hand, you don't have to assemble a Cessna yourself. It also is fully FAA certified so it's ""safer"".

MachinePorn,2y3m42,dutchbag,2,Fri Mar 6 07:06:39 2015 UTC,"I take it this has a custom dual ignition system and has been optimised for a specific narrow RPM range rather than just taking an engine straight off a crate and thinking ""this is perfect for a plane""?  And a dry sump, and I don't think the LS2/3 is really designed to fly inverted or under the G-forces a plane (especially an aero/race one) can manage. There must be more to it than just ""here's an engine"", surely."
MachinePorn,2y3m42,diesel_stinks_,2,Fri Mar 6 07:10:29 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The engine is completely custom. You'll note I put LS2/3 (rather than LS3 or LS2) this is because the engine is a combination of both specs with a eye toward weight minimization. Beyond that the engine has been totally converted for aircraft use, including an aerobatic fuel and oil system, and fitted with a reduction gearbox with a 2400-2800 rpm operating range. It is also equipped with fully automatic engine control and monitoring system."
MachinePorn,2y3m42,dutchbag,1 point,Fri Mar 6 13:11:20 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised they didn't go for the LS7 engine. It's already got a dry sump oil system from the factory, and the added displacement will help with lower RPM torque. I guess they'd still need the reduction gearbox on either engine, so the LS7 would just be unnecessary cost."
MachinePorn,2y3m42,aguinan24,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"I kinda hate GM, but it's hard to ignore just how good the LS engines are. Anyway, I've been dreaming about something like this for a long time.   It's weird that they flipped the manifold around so it's backward in the plane, it seems like it would make a lot more sense to have the air cleaner at the back of the engine.    http://altitudegroupllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/P85_Engine_Start_02.jpg  Edit: It looks like there's a distributor at the back of the engine, that would explain why the manifold is facing the other direction. That's another odd move on their part. DIS is ridiculously simple, it seems like it would be better to keep the simpler ignition system so there's less to go wrong."
MachinePorn,2y3m42,nullcharstring,4,Fri Mar 6 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"The CAD render shows the intake manifold in the normal LSx configuration, fed from what looks like a large-plenum intercooler, which is fed by twin turbos.  Turbos are nice for this setup, as the engine won't lose much power with altitude.  The engine is backwards in the plane, as the flywheel/flexplate is driving a gear reducer.  The real-world picture shows a naturally-aspirated setup, which I suspect they have mocked up for quick testing.  It does not include the twin turbos of the CAD model.  The real-world picture shows an engine with a flipped manifold."

MachinePorn,2y0oqh,TCoop,3,Thu Mar 5 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"After exhaustive research, found an old issue of Flight, dating back to 1947. Apparently they were hydraulic couplings. Looks like these engines were fitted with a couple different varieties of supercharger, this one appears to be of the ""Single-Stage Hydraulically Driven Variable Speed"" type (VSBII-G)  http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%201083.html  edit- that is literally the only information I could find on it, if someone else has anything more please share."
MachinePorn,2y0oqh,GillicuttyMcAnus,5,Thu Mar 5 20:26:35 2015 UTC,"All I know is that the Americans got the idea for a hydraulically variable supercharger from the Germans, who were using the arrangement before the start of WW2.  Edit: From reading the description, it sounds like the 4360 used its couplings to change gears, unlike the Germans who just varied the amount of power that the coupling transferred to the supercharger.   Edit: Something was bothering me about that explanation because (based on the cutaway) there's no way that the fluid couplings could have had a (significantly) different gear ratio for each one. It looks like the variation in the amount of power that was sent to the supercharger was controlled by varying the number of fluid couplings that were engaged at one time, not by using them to engage different gear ratios. More fluid couplings engaged meant that more power was sent to the supercharger. The article said something about the engineers wanting to avoid running the couplings at partial lockup because they were inefficient in that mode, their fix was to always run the couplings at maximum lockup and then just vary how many of them were sending power to the supercharger, thereby varying the amount of boost the supercharger would provide."
MachinePorn,2y0oqh,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"Good find!  It definitely sounds like it's designed to help transmit power power effectively. Maybe it's a bit more complex than an automotive counterpart, but it definitely sounds like they're based on the same concepts."

State transportation officials say the broken machine reached a stopping point inside the rescue pit late Tuesday, clearing the way for workers to start the disassembly process.  The tunnel is being built to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct, damaged in a 2001 earthquake. The machine started digging in the summer of 2013, but broke down in December. 2013.  Bertha moved forward 57 feet since Feb. 17 in its effort to reach the pit. Along the way, the machine built nine concrete tunnel rings.  Now that Bertha is in place, workers will disconnect hoses and cables, remove motors and prepare to lift four pieces weighing 2,000 tons to the surface for repairs.   http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/seattle/2015/03/04/bertha-repairs-rescue-pit/24377071/"

MachinePorn,2xyiuz,sheravi,7,Thu Mar 5 04:10:42 2015 UTC,"The real reason is it used to be with 2 valve engines you wanted to make the valves big for performance, this meant the spark plug had to be out to the side because the intake valve needed to stretch to the center. In this scenario valve size plays a far bigger role in performance than spark plug location.  However with the advent of DOHC engines and 4 valves per cylinder it left a nice little area for the spark plug in the center. A more balanced flame front was a bonus.   Cost had little to do with it, it was all about space and putting what mattered the most first."

MachinePorn,2xln42,Foxhunter1200,-1,Mon Mar 2 23:51:22 2015 UTC,It's a turbojet. Turbofans are found in large subsonic aircraft. Turbojets are found in small supersonic aircraft that require high specific thrust (power to weight) but don't care as much about specific fuel consumption (efficiency of the engine).
MachinePorn,2xln42,roberto_1632,4,Wed Mar 11 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"You're almost there, friend.  High bypass turbofans are found in commercial aircraft. It would be common to see a turbofan used on a commercial aircraft with a bypass ratio of 10:1 (meaning that 10 kg of air bypasses the combustion core for every kg that passes through the core). The P&W F-100 is a turbofan, but it's a very LOW bypass turbofan (ratio 0.63:1). The low bypass turbofan allows for efficiency in the subsonic regime, where a patrolling combat aircraft will spend most of its time. Throw a couple of stages of afterburner on there for combat performance when needed.  Even P&W call the F-100 a turbofan."
MachinePorn,2xkthw,xarc13,32,Sun Mar 1 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"I just started working at the facility that casts the blades and airfoils for these turbines, specifically on the ceramic cores that form the cooling passages inside the castings. 2 months in and I'm still amazed at the complexity of those pieces (The larger ones are around $500 apiece and they're ridiculously easy to break). Some of the cooling passages are no thicker than a pencil lead. The airfoils on the hot side experience temperatures several hundred degrees C hotter than the melting point of the nickel superalloy they are made from. An incredibly thin boundary layer of air from the leading edge cooling passages is all that protects them from disintegrating."

Since the cores are so expensive, and the casting process for directionally solidified is time consuming and costly, you don't want to risk losing the parts due to a weak shell. However, at the same time, you don't want to add processing time as it can take a while for each of those backup coats to dry. I work at a foundry as well and we cast parts for marine applications. We don't work with directionally solidified or single crystals, but I've always been curious about the process. Would definitely love to work with a vacuum furnace some day."

This is probably the biggest missed opportunity for mechanical computers. It didn't occur to Hollerith in the 1890. It didn't occur to IBM in 1928, they continued to use punched cards even post ww2.  Imagine the possibilities that open by simply combining the typewriter and the tape punch into a single machine. Whenever you type a page it also generates a paper tape. If you run the tape again trough the machine it generates a typed page. Soon they would have figured to interface the same technology with their mechanical calculators which would have led them to first practical programming. Then interface multiple machines using cables and you have excel style tabulation and databases, totally mechanical too! Babbage would have loved it.  Do read on Semen Korsakov btw. Interesting fella, developing databases and search engines in that era."
MachinePorn,2xe1vj,HAL-42b,8,Sat Feb 28 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"I think they simply didn't have enough applications for such a machine. It would be an incredibly complicated and expensive design, but the demand would be extremely [low].  Actually, even something as useful as the typewriter had a rough start, many of the inventor struggled for solvency or went straight up bankrupt.  The programmable computer only arose through the need for large data analysis, and that was pretty much a WW2 thing... And they were funded by the state, so there's that."
MachinePorn,2xe1vj,RdClZn,5,Sat Feb 28 04:53:29 2015 UTC,"In Sherlock Holmes there is a girl that takes typing lessons and buys a typewriter so she could earn a livelihood, in The Baskerville Hound I think.  So in that era the typewriters are already popular and the profession of typist/secretary is already formed as woman's job. In the same era the position of clerk is  still firmly a man's job. From this alone we can say that the typewriter is new and yet well established as beneficial and necessary as a business tool. We are comparing it to pen and ink after all.  One major shortcoming of the typewriter was its inability to copy text. Even after the invention of the carbon paper copying still involved retyping the whole text. It was tedious and prone to errors. Same goes for correcting errors, you had to backspace and hit the correct letter several times until it became bolder than the wrong letter below, so this was how bold lettering came to be. The Liquid Paper didn't get invented until 1951 by Bette Nesmith Graham, the mother of  Michael Nesmith of The Monkees. where would we be without wikipedia  So the ability to copy a page by simply re-running the tape or making corrections would have been seized by the manufacturers like you wouldn't believe. With this in 1900 you would have been the king of the world"
MachinePorn,2xe1vj,HAL-42b,3,Sat Feb 28 06:01:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Sherlock Holmes is a historically accurate movie, but according to this wikipedia article:   By December 1874, only 400 typewriters had been sold, due in part to their high price and poor reliability.[34] As businesses were slow to adopt the machine, authors, clergymen, lawyers and newspaper editors were the targeted customers.[35] Individuals, however, generally did not write enough to justify the machine's price of about $125, the average annual income per person at the time.[36][37]   So no, it was quite an expensive investment and pretty inaccessible. Only by the 1880's did they lower the price (to $80, still pretty expensive) due to competition, but the production was still low, and all that after much struggle to stay afloat.  Also, was an even simpler way of doing corrections after the dash was introduced. By the way, even the implementation of your idea would be difficult. A punch card holds very little information, the easiest way to implement the idea as I can see is to have a number corresponding to a key stroke for each row. Searching machines at that time were slow, printing one page would take at least as much time as a human would.  Also, why would anyone want to replicate what's written by a typewriter many times over? They were used for dealing with correspondence and documents: i.e very personal stuff that didn't require a large number of copies for the same material!  So, not only it would require a HUGE investment in development, but it would probably not have a market for it."

For large scale applications I don't think there would be much benefit for an automated typing machine, not only because of its' reduced effectiveness (due to the technology at the time), but also because of the [I imagine] huge costs of such machine.  I think the idea is interesting, to have a steampunk printing machine, but my guess is that there's good reasons for why it wasn't tried nor done."
MachinePorn,2xe1vj,RdClZn,1 point,Sat Feb 28 07:51:58 2015 UTC,"the demand would be extremely.   Not really, unless you were bigger than IBM it was cheaper to hire someone to do your accounting by hand."

MachinePorn,2xe1vj,the_wurd_burd,3,Sat Feb 28 03:14:33 2015 UTC,Thank you. Sometimes I like to think about history of technology not in terms of what got invented but what was missed. Things that escaped the inventors and never got their chance to shine.  For example Jumo 204 type opposed piston engines never got popular due to the ww2. This style of engine can be advantageous in commercial vehicles even today. Napier tried a more complex variation with their Deltic and it was an amazing powerplant but the people servicing  it clearly didn't trust it because it was far too unusual. History of technology is full of this sort of things.

However this aircraft has a relatively large surface area because of the extra length each way, which shouldn't have been a big deal once through the transonic region, but the problem was this thing could not get through that.  Another problem from a quick glance is that I don't thing they had discovered how important cross sectional area is for a supersonic aircraft at this point. In the transonic and supersonic realm the Whitcomb area rule becomes very important to reduce wave drag. The rule calls for consistent and smoothly changing cross sectional areas all the way down the aircraft. Where the wings start to add more and more cross sectional area the fuse needs to be waisted to keep the total relatively constant. Best example off the top of my head is the F-5,  beautiful aircraft. The x-2 doesn't appear to follow this."

MachinePorn,2xaiw9,RoundyRoundy,3,Fri Feb 27 02:53:00 2015 UTC,"Ring headers are common on all of the gas turbines I've seen (GE, Siemens, and Westinghouse). They evenly distribute fuel, air, water, and in some cases steam to the burners. The fuel could be gas or liquid. The air could be be for atomization of a liquid fuel or purge air for the unused fuel nozzles on a dual fuel turbine. The water or steam is for emissions control."

MachinePorn,2xak0k,Chadman108,9,Fri Feb 27 01:23:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like 370hp isn't that much. I mean my little Malibu has 250hp. That thing is huge!  *edit: I'm an engineer and I know all about torque, thanks."
MachinePorn,2xak0k,caseycoold,7,Fri Feb 27 01:43:27 2015 UTC,Difference is this will do rated power for thousands of hours with efficiency not far off peak.   Your malibu will drink like a camel and only last a few hundred hours at full power.
MachinePorn,2xak0k,Kiwibaconator,11,Fri Feb 27 06:37:03 2015 UTC,The lifespan and load factor on that tractor engine is way higher than that in your Malibu.
MachinePorn,2xak0k,Bloodysneeze,5,Fri Feb 27 02:41:07 2015 UTC,"A presumably diesel 15.7L V8 is going to operate at much slower speeds than what ever engine is in the Malibu.   Because power is the relationship between torque and velocity, a high torque engine running at low speeds can have a similar power output to a low torque engine at high speeds."
MachinePorn,2xak0k,Thornaxe,8,Fri Feb 27 02:25:09 2015 UTC,"This thing is governed to a max of 2100 rpm, 650 rpm idle."
MachinePorn,2xak0k,sheepheadslayer,3,Fri Feb 27 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"You're right, these machines dont have that much horsepower. Most farmer have a pickup with more horsepower than their largest tractor. These machines are designed to run at rated RPM until their operator falls asleep from exhaustion.  The HP of bulldozers are positively silly, a bulldozer with 370HP weighs ~90000lbs."
MachinePorn,2xak0k,SwissPatriotRG,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:26:34 2015 UTC,It's the torque that does the movin' though.
MachinePorn,2xak0k,asshatnowhere,18,Fri Feb 27 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"Not true, it's the horsepower.  You can always gear a 370 horsepower engine to turn a shaft at the same torque and speed as any other 370 horsepower engine, regardless of the crankshaft torque of the motors.  So a 370hp car v8 can be put in the tractor and turn the wheels with exactly the same force as the diesel v8 given the right transmission.  What you get with a diesel v8 is the durability of producing 370 horsepower constantly for hundreds or thousands of hours without catastrophically failing."
MachinePorn,2xak0k,Thornaxe,5,Fri Feb 27 03:51:46 2015 UTC,also it might be more efficient at providing that power
MachinePorn,2xak0k,Kiwibaconator,4,Fri Feb 27 04:52:35 2015 UTC,"Correct, if you've got more power and less torque, you can always run it through another gear reduction stage to achieve the desired torque.   Big machinery use big diesels due to durability and fuel efficiency. Ultimately however, the amount of pull a vehicle can exert is dependant on only one factor....weight."
MachinePorn,2xak0k,Thornaxe,3,Sat Feb 28 03:11:24 2015 UTC,This man knows.
MachinePorn,2xak0k,eosha,2,Fri Feb 27 06:38:06 2015 UTC,"Horsepower is used as a rating system because it's a base that everyone can understand in ag. They have rated equipment by horsepower for over 100 years now,  so why change?   You want to pull a 40' pull type drill? 250 hp needed  A big dirt mover?  300horse at least  66' feild conditioner?  400 horses are needed.   And since at these engine speeds horse power and torque increase proportionally,  they just use the horsepower rating."
MachinePorn,2xak0k,chaosintestinal,2,Fri Feb 27 13:29:37 2015 UTC,"It has changed somewhat, because there is an implied ""at a given speed"" when we talk about pulling a drill, field cultivator etc. In the past 20 years, ag equipment has tended to be designed for faster ground travel, as it facilitates greater productivity with a given size of equipment. As we drive faster, the horsepower needs of a tractor change somewhat. When you pull something at 8mph instead of 4.5, your tractor needs significantly more horsepower, and less raw weight to support high draft."

MachinePorn,2xak0k,Loudsound07,-7,Sat Feb 28 04:20:34 2015 UTC,"No, it's used because most Americans don't have any idea what kilowatts are. 1 kilowatt = 1.34 horsepower.

MachinePorn,2xak0k,Duke1177,7,Fri Feb 27 01:53:28 2015 UTC,except for the fact that tractors are almost exclusively sold and classed by their horsepower rating. It still gives a relative idea of the torque but it's still silly.  source: own a farm
MachinePorn,2xak0k,mynameisalso,6,Fri Feb 27 03:42:30 2015 UTC,"I hate when people say that.  HP is important still.  In fact I am pretty sure the pto/s on this are rated in HP.  Hopefully someone can confirm.  HP is just torque over time one HP equals 33,000 ft lbs in one minute. :)"
MachinePorn,2xak0k,Thornaxe,3,Fri Feb 27 05:10:41 2015 UTC,"Most big diesels max out around the ~2100 RPM mark.  Torque (lb.in) = 63,025 x Power (HP) / Speed (RPM)  Torque = Power x Constant  It's basically meaningless to argue which rating is ""better"" when talking about a big diesel - they're directly proportional!"
MachinePorn,2xak0k,eosha,2,Fri Feb 27 12:44:27 2015 UTC,They aren't directly proportional if there is another variable (rpm) in the equation.

MachinePorn,2xak0k,Kiwibaconator,5,Sat Feb 28 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"No, useful torque is simply a question of gearing. Horsepower is a measurement of power output. Given appropriate transmissions to make use of their different power curves, a 300hp diesel engine will produce the same drive wheel torque as a 300hp gas engine. The difference is that this engine is designed to put out 100% of rated capacity for many decades."
MachinePorn,2xak0k,Bloodysneeze,2,Fri Feb 27 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"And torque is hp.   Gearboxes exist.   Of course, wear and tear and general durability will be on the side of the slower moving diesel engine, but thats not the point."

MachinePorn,2xak0k,kurtis1,11,Fri Feb 27 02:39:01 2015 UTC,"It was a failure by John Deere. They were prone to overheating issues, too much boost and fuel for the cooling system...we dont work it really hard and it gives zero trouble. The transmissions were the real weak link though, they just were not built to handle the torque of that huge V-8.   Not too many years later and the 10 liter inline 6 came out, same HP but burned HALF of the fuel doing it,  new transmission design for the Quadra-Range and much heavier axles and the 80 series four wheel drive tractor was born.   These 8850's are hard to come by due to low production numbers, but man...its a mule! Its just a ridiculous tractor, and thats why we love it!"
MachinePorn,2xak0k,mynameisalso,7,Fri Feb 27 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"I knew that the 8850s were the only ag tractor to have that V8 diesel, and i knew they were considered a failure, but up until recently i never knew WHY specifically. There are a lot of V8 diesel engines out there that had service records vastly superior to the 8850s, including deere V8s in its industrial equipment.  The reason the 8850s had a shitty track record came down to its frame setup. The frame setup on these contraptions relied on the engine block to help provide rigidity to the tractor, with terrible results. The twisting and pry of the tractor frame on the engine block caused wear and failure."
MachinePorn,2xak0k,This_Explains_A_Lot,4,Fri Feb 27 03:28:41 2015 UTC,"That's incorrect.    Almost all new tractors, and a good deal of older ones including tractors from the 50's, use the engine as a structural feature.  That's why the engine blocks are cast so heavy.

MachinePorn,2x7vzf,Strel0k,5,Thu Feb 26 22:05:42 2015 UTC,They do rip up the roads. That's one of the reasons we have so many potholes in the north.  There is a system of springs on the backside that reduces shocks so that the force does not damage the snowplow frame or truck.

MachinePorn,2x6gbn,Calimhero,0,Thu Feb 26 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"You're not thinking about the exponential growth of 3d printers, if a 3d printer can print its self, then you can quickly multiply the number of printers by a thousand, sure it might take you longer to make each part, but you have a thousand printers doing it at the same time.   That's how 3d printing really takes off."
MachinePorn,2x6gbn,sourbrew,4,Thu Feb 26 22:06:06 2015 UTC,"That's true of a milling machine as well, though. A good CNC mill can produce replica parts of itself if appropriately driven, and yet we don't see an explosion in CNC mills making other CNC mills - partly because there isn't the demand, partly because it's much easier to buy one pre-fabricated, partly because (like 3D printers) some components can't be made using ""self-hosting"" processes, and partly because the optimal tools for producing a milling machine are not exclusively other milling machines.  3D printing has lots of interesting applications, but the ""make more 3D printers!"" side is among the least interesting of them, at least until a sufficiently advanced and precise printer (or, more likely, combined mill/printer) is able to make all the components of an exact replica of itself with minimal subsequent assembly required. Much better to focus on making better printers with conventional techniques, and using additive manufacturing techniques to realise novel designs (things like embedded wiring and channels, 3D printing of concrete in architectural construction, additive sintered metal parts, etc)"
MachinePorn,2x6gbn,hexapodium,-1,Thu Feb 26 22:35:51 2015 UTC,"I think in general you're right that in the short term printers that print themselves will not be a major driver in the market, however it's clear that where we are headed is blended material printers, as well as printers that can eventually embed electronics directly in what they are printing.  Moore's law applies to 3d printing, http://3dprint.com/7543/3d-printing-moores-law/, and it's important to remember that exponential curves move a lot faster than anyone really expects them to. Your cellphone for instance would have been hard for people to believe was possible as recently as the 70's and for a good many americans well into the 80's or 90's."
MachinePorn,2x6gbn,sourbrew,3,Thu Feb 26 22:39:54 2015 UTC,"No, exponential curves move exactly as fast as anyone who thinks about them for a moment, expects them to. You're also describing a geometric growth curve (t2 ) not an exponential one (kt ).   It's worth remembering that Moore's law held for a specified period, and has flattened out severely in recent years due to technical limitations; exactly the same sorts of limits are going to push up against 3D printing (curing times, material limits on feedstock, etc) and prevent it from rivalling true mass production techniques like sheet stamping or high volume injection moulding Although your source says they've beaten injection moulding on speed, they don't account for the fact that 3D printing is (approximately) a linear-time process, whereas injection moulding is, to a first approximation, a zero-marginal-time process, and the simple fact is that the world is always going to need billions of plastic washers of identical design, which are not appropriate to printing. Rapid prototyping is a very valuable technique, but there's a reason we don't all drive bespoke prototype cars or have prototype phones: volume production speed trumps one-off production speed (and the same is true of cost), and apart from in very niche sectors, this fact will remain true indefinitely. Even a factory of ten thousand plastics printers will be larger, less efficient, slower and more expensive in volume production, than a factory with ten, 1000-unit injection moulding die presses (and maybe a 3D printer in the toolroom, for making dies with)  My point remains, that 3D printers are going to do some things very well, and be as fast or faster within their niche than conventional manufacturing techniques. This is also true of different sorts of conventional tooling, though: you can make most things on a 6-axis mill, but some of them will be faster on a 6-axis lathe. In the future, there will be products which are 3D printed as a matter of course: I fully expect to see complex-geometry metalwork products (things like engine manifolds) be printed, because it's going to be the most appropriate technique. But it's foolhardy to pretend that 3D printing is going to conquer the manufacturing sector entirely, because the economics simply don't work like that."

Are there hard limits to some of the processes and materials being used? Sure but we are already out performing injection molding with our relatively new 3d printing technology, to claim that an industry in it's infancy that is growing at the rate that it is can't supplant the status quo is ignorance at it's finest.   And finally, much has been written about the difficulties in visualizing and predicting exponential change, it's hard to do because the rate of change is changing.   See most futurists from the 1970's for a good example at how hard it is to accurately predict the future and what exponential change in computational capacity has created."

I had this idea, idly, years ago - in any 3D printer you've already got all the moving parts of a three-axis milling machine, why not add a cutting head to improve print resolution by making a fine machining pass over each layer?   I dismissed it because I was sure far smarter experts than me must have seriously considered it. This is the first time I've ever heard of it, though. I'm just glad it found some success, however limited.   Time is probably the constraining factor - the method I suggested would take approx. twice as long (double the number of passes)"
MachinePorn,2x6gbn,Ivebeenfurthereven,3,Thu Feb 26 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"And if you are going to print and mill, why not just mill it? Why have an expensive intermediate process with almost no gain?"
MachinePorn,2x6gbn,battle_cattle,2,Thu Feb 26 12:58:52 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert but I can take a guess...  My guess would be that it's useful to print and mill for material efficiency's sake.  Milling is a reductive process.  Printing is an additive process.  If you can only mill, your billet or blank must be larger than the part you're making.  If you add in printing, then you can start with a smaller blank and use the additive printing process to add bits of material where you need it.  I hope that made sense."

A milling pass after every single layer is deposited gives you the opportunity to improve resolution of sometimes crudely printed parts, without losing the flexibility of 'internal access' to complicated areas.   I do agree that machining is generally far, far more practical than 3D printing. I dislike the hype the media gives quite a niche, limited manufacturing technique. My idea was in response to complaints a few years ago that 3D printed parts didn't have a very high resolution - I thought, why not integrate small-scale milling to improve the tolerances of the final part?   I suspect the accuracy of 3D printers - especially expensive ones - has now advanced to the point where my idea is mostly obsolete."

I'm sure that for simple some simple shapes its possible, i remember seeing a video of on of those huge ""3d printers"" making a house out of concrete and every pass it made it smoothed each layer as it was setting it down iirc.   I can't really think of a way in which this machine and the technology it has to offer gives the user a major technical advantage that can't be found in other techniques.

These Australian engineers have done some impressive work, but rushing out and saying ""we did it first"" is really misleading.    Even the highest quality process still requires polishing of contact surfaces on moving engine parts, as well as a way to seal enclosed areas.  Surfaces such as bearings must be round and smooth to several orders of magnitude finer than the process is capable of producing - Bearings must be within a few microns at worst (.001) while sintering operations generally only produce features to within .02 - .03 millimeters.  Large internal chambers can be made with this process, but the process purposely has a 'bleed hole' added to it to allow the internal heat (read: pressure) to escape and prevent defects in the final layers of the part.  This hole must be plugged (we would Tig weld it) after the part has cooled.

MachinePorn,2x6gbn,thefattestman22,2,Thu Feb 26 05:08:09 2015 UTC,"Frank Whittles jet engine, the first jet engine ever recognized by the world as functional, was of the centrifugal design. Heres a drawing of it.   http://www.midlandairmuseum.co.uk/images/w2700.png  Heres the patent drawing.  http://www.thaitechnics.com/engine/tg7/frank_patent.jpg  Heres a photo.  http://www.thelogbook.co.uk/welland.jpg  Axial flow turbines at the time were not advanced enough to do the job, whereas the centrifugal design was already well established and understood from steam turbines. (Whittle in fact, created a number of improvements to the steam turbine in the process, as he was the first man to ever account for the vortex created by the turbine blades. Much to the displeasure turbine company he partnered with to make his engine. Hurt their pride.)  Heres a Saturn MD-120 with centrifugal compressor.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saturn_MD-120_cutaway.jpg  Heres a goblin engine, which powered the De Havilland Vampire.   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/DH_Goblin_annotated_colour_cutaway.png  So, as you can see. You are full of shit and completely wrong. Centrifugal compressors can power gas turbine engines, they have powered gas turbine engines for over half a century,  and they can produce enough power to make an airplane fly on jet thrust alone.  The engine they copied to make this model was an APU for a business jet. It's designed specifically to produce compressed air to start up the main engines. It's not a turboshaft."

Centrifugal compressors can power gas turbine engines, they have powered gas turbine engines for over half a century, and they can produce enough power to make an airplane fly on jet thrust alone.   Again, My comment reads ""Standard"" not all. The majority of ""jet engines"" used now that have a centrifugal compressor have a ducted fan of some type (which the one this post is about is lacking).   I'd be interested to see how much thrust can be created from exhaust alone in the design of the one in the post. It has an upturned exhaust casing rather than a nozzle in the photos (indicating to me this turbine is not made directly for the purposes for creating thrust, but shaft power).   But, if you prefer to throw insults as opposed to having a debate, that's fine too."
MachinePorn,2x6gbn,QuattroStig,2,Thu Feb 26 13:33:34 2015 UTC,"3D printing is a buzzword  that engine prototype was made with sintering, and weve been sintering engine parts and other metal things for 20+ years.     with the recent trend of desktop cnc and 3d printing (hot glue gun style).  this happened:   More recently the meaning of the term has expanded to encompass a wider variety of techniques such as extrusion and sintering based processes.   RUNNING SHIT THROUGH A DIE IS NOT 3D PRINTING."
MachinePorn,2x6gbn,wiretapp,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:05:04 2015 UTC,"Those parts were produced with DMLM or DMLS most likely, so it is indeed 3d printing.  Google tells me that quote comes from Wikipedia and based on your everything you have said, I'm going to guess most of your understanding came from there also.  FDM is an extrusion process and is 100% 3d printing.  SLS of plastic or DMLS in metal are sintering and 100% 3d printing."
MachinePorn,2x6gbn,drseamus,2,Thu Feb 26 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"No it comes from me working in the industry where;  3d printing means fancy hot glue gun on an x,y,z deck.  sintering means lasers and metal dust woooo!  and extrusions are formed by push shit through dies.   My problem does directly come from that wiki, where they include things such as t-slot extruded aluminum as a 3d printed material.  Where it used to be called an extruded aluminum.  The term additive manufacturing is a better all encompassing term, and leaves '3d printing' to be exactly what it sounds like, printing in 3d space.    If making extruded t-slot and sintering is '3d printing'... then so is welding."
MachinePorn,2x6gbn,wiretapp,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:09:53 2015 UTC,"I don't want to blow your mind here, but when you have a ""fancy hot glue gun"" the glue is extruded out the tip, hence extrusion.  Nowhere on that wiki page does it mention extruded aluminum as a 3d printing technology, and you shouldn't you be using wikipedia as a primary source anyway.  I don't know what industry you work in, but you're in the stone age if you limit the term 3d printing to FDM.  I work directly with advanced 3d printing and we use the terms 3d printing and additive manufacturing interchangeably."

MachinePorn,2x4zde,tallyrand,16,Wed Feb 25 18:32:02 2015 UTC,"The Can-Am Killer!  Here are some excerpts from Mark Donohue's book The Unfair Advantage where he talks about getting the kinks out of the turbo-panzer.  ""After lunch they asked if I would drive the car, to give the photographers some action shots. I didn't expect to have to drive it right then! It had been a hectic few days. We were out drinking late the night before, and we had to get up early for our meetings. I had no desire to drive at all. But it seemed to be such an important thing for them that I got in the car, fired it up, and took it out on the track.  ...Just driving around, my initial reaction wasn't too favorable. In the first place, I was hung over, and didn't want to go too fast. But even at that speed the car was terrible. It was ""hunting"" back and forth on the straightaway is if it had an inch of toe-out. I had to jam my legs against the steering wheel to keep it in a straight line at 150 mph.  ...I came in thinking, ""Christ! I'm glad that's over with. They have their pictures and we can all go home."" I was ready to take the car to the skidpad and start over from scratch. Flegl [Porsche factory engineer] walked over to the car and said, ""You went around in 53 seconds. The record for this car is 51.5 seconds. What do you think is wrong?"" I looked over and there were five mechanics standing there. Suddenly it hit me that they were expecting a command performance--some new lap records, right there! Then I remembered the huge ""record board"" they had on a wall at the factory. It had a map of the course, and lists of the lap records set by various cars and drivers. I had never driven the track before. I had never sat in the car before, and they expected me to break the lap record. Germans are very tough people. They expect the maximum from everybody at all times.  ...When we were at the track a truck showed up with another 917 It looked like the Spyder we had seen before at Can-AM races--an ugly, dirty, beat-up old thing--except that it was longer. It turned out to have a sixteen-cylinder motor that they wanted me to try. I was told that it was built by special order from the Piechs, and it was quite expensive...  They didn't tell me much about it, but I clearly got the impression that it was a possible alternative to the turbocharged twelve, or that it could even be turbocharged itself--for something like 2000 horsepower. So I drove the thing for them, and it was a real monster. The motor was so long that you could hear one end start up before the other. There were exhaust pipes sticking out everywhere. Although it wasn't set up properly to try for any lap records, it was truly impressive in a straight line. We realized then that we had to have the turbo-motor, and as soon as possible. I told Flegl that we must have one to test in America, because of the weather problems in Germany in the winter. since we had never even seen the turbocharged version before, they sent their engine guy, Fritz Springler, with it. We went back to Atlanta with the first turbo-motor in February. But it was cold there and the engine wouldn't start. Eventually we towed it around the track a few times before we got it to run at all. Then, once it started, we damn near couldn't keep it running...   We sent it back to Germany with a long dissertation on the problem, and possible solutions they could try. Another engine arrived shortly, with Flegl and their head engine guy, Val Schaffer...  We had to tow the car to get it started, and it wouldn't run at part throttle. I was getting exasperated. I showed Flegl and the engine expert what was happening, and they said they understood, but neither one knew what to do about it.   ...I decided that it was foolish to waste any more time in the States. I told Flegl that I'd have to go to Germany and work with their engine men personally.  ...I told Roger that we were going to get smoked by Mclaren if we couldn't get the turbo-motor to run right...  ...I was totally exasperated. I said, ""We are wasting our time on the track. Now we must take the engine out of the car, put it back on the dynamometer, and i will try to show you what is wrong."" While they were doing that, I looked at their dyno output curve. They had all the necessary data--torque, RPM, boost pressure, and so on--except that their curve started at 5000 RPM. I said ""Why are there no curves up to that point?"" They said, ""The motor does not run there."" I thought ""Christ! That's what I've been trying to tell you for a month!"" I couldn't believe it was that simple. I couldn't believe that they had simply calibrated the fuel injection for wide-open throttle with full boost, and had totally ignored any part-throttle operation.  ...The first thing I recognized was that we would have to run the motor with no blower. They said ""But it is a turbo-motor. It will have no power."" Finally I convinced them that there were times when the boost was very low and yet the engine must keep running. When we took the blower off--it wouldn't run at all! When we tried to accelerate above idle, it just died. So we fitted the motor with two control levers--one for the throttle butterflies and one for the fuel-flow meter. The engine guys were a little angry. They were mumbling in German, ""He runs in America with the blower and is not happy. Then he runs here with the blower and is not happy. Then he runs on the dyno with the blower and is not happy. Now we run on the dyno without the blower and he is still not happy. We are going backwards."""

For example to get 1000 hp and 4000lbft(yeah I'm rounding up) the engine will only be turning at 1313 rpm.   if Power = (Torque * Rpm)/5252  then rpm = (Power * 5252)/torque  plugging in our values (1000 * 5252) / 4000 = 1313 rpm   However a quick google of PT6a-50 yeilded  this link that suggests the PT6a-50 spins at 30017 rpm at full power and thus our engine might only put out 175 lbft of torque but has a 22.74:1 reduction gearbox and output about 3979.5 lbft."

MachinePorn,2wvcb9,unigami,3,Mon Feb 23 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"These were produced in Sweden from 1957 to 1981 and many of them are still in use today. They had a VW engine that developed about 40 hp and also used the transmission from the VW van and many other VW parts. One of the unique design innovations of this vehicle was the steering mechanism, which used a device called a ""variator"" to divide up the power going to each track set, increasing the power to one side while decreasing it to the other. This allowed steering with very little power loss, unlike other designs that used braking mechanisms.    You might remember seeing one of these in ""The Shining"".    Another interesting bit of trivia that I discovered was that the FBI used one of these back in 1971 to search for D.B Cooper - the infamous hijacker who jumped out of a 727 near Portland OR with $200,000 and was never found. That machine is still in use today and is privately owned."

MachinePorn,2wsbdr,Traches,18,Sun Feb 22 19:19:54 2015 UTC,"This is the brains of an H model C-130's constant speed propeller. The bottom bit is the pump housing and provides hydraulic pressure to the top bit, which is the valve housing. It's driven by the rotation of the propeller shaft, which runs through that big hole in the middle. The valve housing meters hydraulic fluid to the propeller in order to adjust blade angle and govern engine speed: too high, and it increases blade angle to take a bigger bite and bring it back to 100%. Too low and it does the opposite. The best part? It has some electrical components that stabilize and smooth the RPM, but it will run just fine on speeder springs and flyweights, with no electrical power at all."

MachinePorn,2wk4zg,sr71Bot,24,Sat Feb 21 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"An excerpt from the book ""Sled Driver"" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:   There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.  It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.  I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.  We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.  Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.  Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.  Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.  ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""  For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

MachinePorn,2wj4nc,achbaca,25,Fri Feb 20 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"I got to demo this in October of last year and as a civilian, I have to say it was amazing.   Most stunning to me was the night sky. The stars through a high quality night vision helmet were absolutely beautiful. I'm sure stargazing is one of the last intended uses for this product, but I loved it nonetheless."
MachinePorn,2wj4nc,Mike312,2,Fri Feb 20 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"What is the quality? I remember several years ago an...associate of mine described the NVGs his company was working on and said that they produced full color night vision, though it was weird because the shadows were amplified compared to normal daylight. Like someone took normal video and did a heavy contrast balance on it."
MachinePorn,2wj4nc,achbaca,2,Sat Feb 21 08:31:39 2015 UTC,"Before I answer, I have to provide a disclaimer.  I'm no expert here - I only got to demo NV and thermal setups.  Most of what I know, I learned that day with some other tidbits gleaned from reddit.  This particular unit was strictly an ambient light amplifier.  It was the same green view as most of us are familiar with, which (from my understanding) is green because that's the color by which the human eye can distinguish the most levels of brightness. Since color's aren't very visible in dim light, I'd be surprised if this option were available on NVG (since I know next to nothing about it, I'm prepared to be wrong).  The quality was pretty amazing and was further enhanced by the panorama provided by the 2 additional scopes.  Compared to all the other equipment I was able to try that evening, this unit completely blew me away.  I did see some previous generation gear and image quality was definitely not as good.  Any color units that I saw were thermal scopes, which are a different technology.  They detect heat sources and apply false colors (in some cases) to distinguish intensity.  In case anyone's interested, I was able to demo this equipment at the Noctober event outside of Austin, TX.  There were several ranges with differing weapon types and man NV and thermal products.  Manufacturer reps and instructors were on hand to help with equipment and range safety.  It was a really fun experience.  http://www.ftwga.com/  There's no date for the next event, but I assume it will be in October again."

Their movement is powered by a 'buoyancy engine' which pumps hydraulic fluid to change the effective displacement.  Increase displacement -> rise, decrease displacement -> sink.

Sure, you can use those things to make your part to tolerance, but I can pretty easily cut a part to within +/- .0002 on a good CNC."
MachinePorn,2w6sqo,thechoochlyman,13,Tue Feb 17 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"Why would you put those constraints to the argument though? Before CNC and even before power tools of any kind the standard order of work was cut-file-heat treat-grind-lap-polish. Everybody followed that, from watchmakers to shipbuilders. You can clerly see that the ball and the cylinder in the picture are lapped, not simply ground.  Today's economic pressures were not an issue, standardization did not exist, standard fits and tolerances were unheard of. In that environment the fact that you can machine an annealed part to +/- .0002 simply did not matter. Every part was manually fettled and worked individually until the desired fit was achieved. The concept of interchangeable parts did not exist and every pert was unique. Besides, if precision mattered the part would be heat treated and would wrap anyway."

Even a Haas lathe, which is completely automated, still has to be compensated for tool wear and have the inserts changed on a regular basis. The lathe I run - a Prototrak - has a toolpost, which means I have to manually swap tools each time the program gets done with a cycle. Just taking off the tool and putting it back on can change the final diameter by as much as a thousandth, so it requires constant measuring and compensating to get right. Not to mention that coolant flush, depth of cut, and insert geometry all contribute to how much deflection the tool makes. Plus, I rarely make two parts that are identical. Everything is different."

MachinePorn,2w2uxp,iBlag,30,Mon Feb 16 19:04:36 2015 UTC,"Babbitt bearings are used all over the world in numerous industries. Every power-gen gas and steam turbine in the world uses Babbitt bearings. Every hydroelectric station uses them too. You find them in paper mills, compressors, pumps, mining equipment etc. No wind power yet because the blades and gearboxes can still use ball bearings. If they get larger there might be interested in heavier duty Babbitt bearings (we have been approached on this subject). You don't realize how common they are because there are no consumer applications. Babbitt bearings are arguably the most important element to a smooth running turbine."

MachinePorn,2w2uxp,Jabberwocky918,6,Mon Feb 16 21:32:50 2015 UTC,"im fairly mechanically competent, but that went over my head. could you eli19?"
MachinePorn,2w2uxp,Ileach,33,Mon Feb 16 22:05:36 2015 UTC,"The turning gear is a small motor connected to a gearbox which is then positioned so that it can turn the engine very slowly via the teeth on the flywheel. It looks a bit like a starter motor and it actually operates in a similar way except it is very slow.  Before starting the engine, the turning gear is engaged and the engine is turned over. In order to allow the compressed air to escape from the cylinders during turning, the indicator cocks are opened. Indicator cocks are valves connected to the combustion chamber through the cylinder head. While turning the engine, the engineer on watch will monitor the discharge from each of these cocks to ensure that there is no oil, water or fuel discharge from any of the cylinders. presence of any of these will indicate a fault inside the cylinder (water from a cracked liner, fuel from a faulty/leaking injector etc). Starting or attempting to start the engine with any of these present in the cylinders could lead to catastrophic damage of the engine.  Once the engine has been turned a couple of times on the turning gear, the turning gear is removed and the engine is kicked over on air, still with the cocks open. (These engines are started by injecting air into each cylinder in turn, not by a starter motor like most smaller engines). Again, the engineer watches the engine while air is injected into each cylinder through a restricted valve. Once turned, all cocks are shut and the main air start valve is selected and the engine is kicked on air while also adding fuel, starting the engine.  There are a lot of steps I have missed out here but it gives a basic overview on how these engines are started. In addition to this, I don't think I have ever typed the word 'cock' so much in a non abusive way!  Obligatory gold edit: Many thanks, I am going to assume it was for the widespread use of cock."

MachinePorn,2w2uxp,swaags,7,Mon Feb 16 23:47:35 2015 UTC,Very similar. There are additional things I've missed such as pre-lubing of the cylinder liners via the cylinder lubrication system. I've only sailed with one medium speed engine that had this and that was still much larger than any locomotive medium speed engine. I'm just guessing but I would imagine most locomotive diesels run at speeds between 600-1200 rpm. These slow speed crosshead lumps run in the region of 28-200 rpm depending on engine size and required speed.

MachinePorn,2w2uxp,swaags,3,Tue Feb 17 18:16:24 2015 UTC,Huh reminds me of the only other large scale use of a turning gear that I'm aware of: steam turbines that turn the generators that feed the grid. It's necessary because the shaft of the turbines can actually bow downward if its not kept rotating during maintenance outages.

MachinePorn,2w2uxp,Overgoats,8,Tue Feb 17 05:56:17 2015 UTC,"The engine is not necessarily scrap. Large slow-speed, 2-stroke crosshead engines are modular. The engines are basically a collection of removable components. The damaged sections can just be removed and replaced. It's possible and probably likely that the crankshaft has slipped due to this. The engine can be re-timed to accommodate this slip as long as it's not too severe. If it is, the crankshaft web can actually be re-positioned.  Liners, heads, camshaft sections, fuel pumps, jackets etc are all replaceable and individual to each cylinder (unit)."

MachinePorn,2w2uxp,FoodBeerBikesMusic,2,Mon Feb 16 22:39:49 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I was just pointing out to those who may think that the whole engine may be scrapped due to this incident that engines of this size often return to service after being damaged like this. I've worked on engines that have sustained much worse damage too and then been repaired and returned to service.
MachinePorn,2w2uxp,mechanicalmaan,-13,Mon Feb 16 21:12:20 2015 UTC,"The concept of part replacement, as opposed to complete assembly replacement, is a pretty basic idea. The only people who would have no functional concept of this would be the most ignorant of uneducated consumers.  I think you both need to re-think your approaches. If you wanted to talk about a concept you're interested in, you need to properly introduce your intention. KCbizzy could stand to be a bit more friendly.

MachinePorn,2w2uxp,Sylll,7,Tue Feb 17 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"Does being so patronising come naturally to you?  While the ""concept of part replacement"" is a basic idea, unless you have a major interest in marine engines or you actually work on these engines like I do, you probably have next to no idea just how modular these engines are compared to a common car or truck engine. Damage sustained that would render the majority of internal combustion engines scrap can more often than not be repaired via the replacement of the damaged parts on these marine engines with the overall repair cost being much less than the cost of a new engine. Drop a valve in a car or truck engine, you might end up scoring a liner, holing the piston, wrecking the cylinder head and damaging the engine beyond economic repair. Do the same on a large marine crosshead engine and you will still be shelling out for a repair but it will only be to that one affected cylinder/unit. The rest of the engine will remain relatively unaffected. You can even pull the damaged piston, piston rod and con rod, blank off the stuffing box, lift the fuel pump to that unit and carry on running the engine albeit at a reduced speed until repairs are effected.   I think you both need to re-think your approaches.   Maybe practice what you preach."

MachinePorn,2w2mfh,FoodBeerBikesMusic,3,Tue Feb 17 01:40:45 2015 UTC,No. RS232 in the 60's commonly used DB25 connectors. Those are a 3-row connector with more than 25 pins. Might still be a DB shell though.
MachinePorn,2w2mfh,tatch,1 point,Tue Feb 17 03:39:46 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature  The D-sub connector family was used for many purposes. This one is the DD50. The DB25 is probably the most familiar because it was used to carry RS232 signals and for PC-style centronics parallel printer ports.  These days connectors are getting so dense that it's hard to believe this was considered ""sub-miniature"" but it really was denser than other connectors used at the time."

Not very fast, but effective for generation. What you don't see is the exciter housing and stator. This is a synchronous motor. Probably just vomiting useless facts.

MachinePorn,2w0vff,Ap21234,13,Mon Feb 16 05:09:26 2015 UTC,No seriously - go on. I took the tour but was rushed through by my group. So many things I missed (but did get to walk inside the model).   I got the impression the entire weight of the turbine+rotor is sitting on only two bearings. Is this correct?
MachinePorn,2w0vff,Ap21234,8,Mon Feb 16 05:26:59 2015 UTC,"Kind of... The rotor sits on a set of thrust bearings. A motor pumps oil into the housing, creating an oil wedge, then when the unit is up to speed the pump will shut off and the velocity of the rotor will maintain the wedge. So, depending on the set up, yes. The really interesting thing about these motor-generators is the extremely small room for clearances, usually just a few thousandths of an inch for alignment and bearing spacing.   Edit: Another thing you don't see is the Thrust Collar. The solid machined steel collar that is precision fit and set at the top of the rotor shaft. This is what actually rides on the thrust bearings."

MachinePorn,2w0vff,Ap21234,2,Wed Feb 18 00:15:01 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, after the rotor poles are removed, the entire thing can be disassembled into smaller parts for transport."

The hydro stuff is the best! 2,000,000 pounds sitting our bearings with 1/1000th of an inch of oil between separating the two. I've been lucky enough to be on the vendor side of things at Hoover.  http://www.pioneer1.com/service-repair/"
MachinePorn,2w0vff,lykedoctor,7,Mon Feb 16 13:29:07 2015 UTC,And this is why I love reddit. Thanks for chiming in.   With the oil in place is there really any ever metal on metal contact?
MachinePorn,2w0vff,lastfeelingdied,3,Mon Feb 16 14:45:07 2015 UTC,"When metal to metal contact occurs it is called boundary lubrication, which is not good. Luckily the bearing utilizes a thin layer of very soft metal, known as Babbitt. Babbitt is a sacrificial layer that is designed to fail before a shaft, as it is multitudes cheaper and faster to fix than a shaft. When a bearing fails due to boundary lubrication (metal to metal contact), it is known as wiping a bearing. This is because the metal instantly becomes molten from the extreme force of the shaft. Here's a picture of a wiped bearing: http://www.tribology.co.uk/image/pb_14.jpg  Theoretically, if you have clean oil the bearing will last forever (perfectly clean oil is a little harder to achieve in the real world), as compared to a finite life of a ball bearing. My family business has been repairing wiped bearings for 95 years! We do a lot more than simple bearing repairs.  I just submitted a picture of our largest centrifugal casting machine, which casts the Babbitt to the steel shell of the bearing. Check out the video."
MachinePorn,2w0vff,Ap21234,4,Mon Feb 16 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, deeper down the rabbit hole here -    How is the oil level measured, and more importantly how fast can the generator be stopped if there is ""boundary lubrication"" incident? I get the heat generated by metal on metal but how hot does the oil get at the low rpm's these rotors spin at? What kind of oil is used for lubrication? Is it thick like what is found in the diffs of my car or is it thinner like engine oil?   And thank you again, this is fascinating to me"
MachinePorn,2w0vff,lykedoctor,4,Mon Feb 16 16:45:11 2015 UTC,"The oil on the bearing surfaces are generally not measured, but there are shaft postion sensors, vibration monitoring probes, oil pressure gauges, and a visual sight glass to confirm oil is passing through a bearing. If there is a boundary layer event, the turbine will pretty well stop its self pretty quick unless its still being driven. IE i got to replace the bearings on a geothermal steam turbine after the lube-oil was shutdown while it was still coasting at 700rpm. Resulting in the turbine dropping to 0rpm in less than a second. As for oil temps we like to see them kept at around 90f. (Too hot and the oil burns, too cold and it will turn to jelly) Oil type is usually ISO 32 or ISO 64 depending on application.

MachinePorn,2w0vff,Pseudoboss11,1 point,Mon Feb 16 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"Balancing is done when the unit is stacked (being put together). Once centered on the thrust bearings, the shaft is centered/balanced."

MachinePorn,2w0vff,Pseudoboss11,1 point,Wed Feb 18 01:35:39 2015 UTC,"I thought that the frequency of the output electricity is determined by the speed of the rotor times half the number of poles it is. Which would mean that it has to operate at 180 RPM to output 60Hz electricity. 90-120 RPM is a range of speeds, so wouldn't that give a range of frequencies between 30 and 45 Hz? Also, in that case, isn't the output frequency also much lower than the standard 60 Hz, which would also cause big problems?  I'm guessing that i'm not quite understanding the role of this rotor, and that the frequency gets changed somewhere else down the line? And that, for those purposes, it just has to be about half the frequency of the desired one, and that it's cheaper to do that than to keep this thing moving at a constant speed for some reason? It seems like 300-ish tons of copper and steel would be pretty good at moving at a constant rate. Though what's a centrifuge or not kinda depends on the forces you're dealing with, I suppose."
MachinePorn,2w0vff,Ap21234,2,Mon Feb 16 17:58:57 2015 UTC,"There isn't anything you aren't understanding. You're right. But the RPM can be varied by the type of impellar in use (variable pitch, nozzle driven or conventional). Not to mention the automatic voltage regulator. Output isn't always calculated by what the machine can do, but most often what the utility line needs or doesn't."
MachinePorn,2w0vff,011100010,1 point,Tue Feb 17 05:09:42 2015 UTC,Interesting. Why would the line need different frequencies of electricity? Wouldn't that cause interference?
MachinePorn,2w0vff,baertrap,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:07:43 2015 UTC,The frequency doesn't vary by a whole lot. The difference is needed for lead/lag on the line depending on an inductive or capacitive load.

MachinePorn,2w2osu,lykedoctor,7,Mon Feb 16 13:38:18 2015 UTC,"There was just a picture of a hydro generator from Hoover dam and there was some discussion about bearings. The machine in this pic is a vertical guide bearing, which keeps everything on the shaft rotating smoothly, from the runner to the generator.   OK here's the description:  Fluid film bearings have a very tiny layer of Babbitt (~90% tin) over its steel shell/housing. Babbitt is a soft metal and is the material that interfaces with oil and a steel turbine shaft. If there is an issue the bearings are designed to fail first (usually known as ""wiping"" because it looks like somebody smeared it, like hot butter) because they are much easier to replace than entire shafts.  There are a few ways to apply the Babbitt to the steel surface, but by far the process with the greatest results is to centrifugally cast the metal. Molten Babbitt is poured from the tank on the right to the bearing on the left while it is spinning @ 250-300rpm. Once everything is cooled down the interior is machined to ultra tight tolerances, in the neighborhood of .002"" tolerances, which is incredible on parts of this size. When stuff gets really tight we are requested to hold tolerances of half a thou.  Here's a video of it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEoyaty3Aok  Disclaimer: I did not take the photograph but I hired a professional photographer to do so for my company's marketing material. This was actually shot with a digital Hasselblad if anyone was curious."
MachinePorn,2w2osu,Harry_Breaker_Morant,2,Mon Feb 16 13:50:45 2015 UTC,Babbit metal is made of an alloy with both hard and soft phases present together. The idea is the hard shaft will wear the softer parts of the bearing alloy easily and make minute passages for the oil.

I'm lucky enough to have lots of attachments for it.  I have steady rest, milling attachment and enough morse bits that fit the tailstock to keep me busy for the rest of my life.

MachinePorn,2vyqvy,HAL-42b,21,Sun Feb 15 11:58:24 2015 UTC,Fiber lasers have completely obsoleted the old CO2 lasers for cutting applications in the last 10 years.   This one is a new technology trying to rival the fiber lasers. It may or may not succeed but cool to look at nonetheless.
MachinePorn,2vyqvy,ivebeenhereallsummer,5,Sun Feb 15 12:02:38 2015 UTC,I can't wrap my head around how that uses 6kW. All those leads going in and that tiny aperture on the laser. I'm no EE major by any stretch but it seem like the equivalent of a water main attached to a kitchen faucet.

I machine parts for similar lasers, they're powerful enough to evaporate metal instantly, which makes them very useful for medical and ultra-small-scale applications, where you need small and very neat, clean, round holes. Drills produce metal chips and the other side of the hole is usually not clean, so metal-vaporising lasers are used."

I've only run 4k-5k slab Co2 lasers and last news I got (a while ago) was the thicker stuff tends to re-fuse the cuts because the kerf width is so small. Is this still the case?  Edit: It seems Co2 isn't so obsolete as you say. From the article in your second post:    ""Both fiber and disk lasers emit at the 1-μm wavelength and currently can’t compete with the cut quality of CO2 lasers when it comes to thick materials, although the difference that wavelength makes in materials processing isn’t fully understood."""
MachinePorn,2vyqvy,MyVeganBicycle,3,Sun Feb 15 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"Seems quite fine with thicker materials  Fortunately the fact that the author doesn't understand the effect of different wavelets has no bearing for the rest of us. It effects two things - the Rayleigh Criterion and the absorption of the material being cut. Both are effected favorably by the shorter wavelength.  The Rayleigh Criterion means that you can bring the beam with shorter wavelength to a tighter focus.   The absorption rate means you can cut some materials which were difficult to cut before, particularly copper."

I'm surprised those engines can hang over the side like that without upsetting the balance. A month or so ago I did a bridge demolition where the Bridge was made of old railcar bottoms spanning between metal piers. A bigger 350 excavator and myself in a 290 excavator would wrench them free and lower them onto the ice, and while the 350 was working on the next one, I'd pick it up with my bucket and thumb and carry it off the river so it could be loaded out. each section was about 45 feet long and so heavy that I had to carry it nice and close to be able to lift it up off the ice. I had to carry it over the side of my tracks, and it lifted the far side tracks up off the ground a few inches. Incredibly unstable. I can't imagine what it would be like running that jet engined tank on the slightest of inclines would be like."

So you are saying wikipedia is a bad source cause the planes tail number is D-ICKS?

MachinePorn,2vlmrs,OhioUPilot12,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:58:10 2015 UTC,Because that is fully loaded with 12 passengers. So they would be at max gross weight. The 1150 range would be at it lightest weight and would give you maximum range.

MachinePorn,2vbx2n,Pink7172,107,Mon Feb 9 19:55:59 2015 UTC,"An excerpt from the book ""Sled Driver"" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:   There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.  It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.  I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.  We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.  Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.  Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.  Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.  ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""  For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

Reading other google links say it was to help dissipate heat from the frame and when flying, was 75° cooler than an unpainted frame, but I just don't get why.   Can anyone ELI5?"
MachinePorn,2vbx2n,Datsoon,6,Tue Feb 10 00:16:21 2015 UTC,When you fly very fast the air around your plane heats up and this makes your plane hot. Since the air around the plane is hot the only way to dump heat is through radiation. The black paint radiates better than other colors so your plane stays cooler.
MachinePorn,2vbx2n,Raptorpowered,2,Tue Feb 10 01:30:59 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not that that is the only way. You'd still be able to cool the plane with convection, through the air around the plane. The black paint just improves the radiative heat transfer. So, better cooling."
MachinePorn,2vbx2n,thefattestman22,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:08:15 2015 UTC,"This was my ELI5 answer. My my goal was to be simple and complete. I believe some of the highest heat flux areas had active cooling by the fuel before it is burned but the fuel only has so much thermal mass and it is easier to paint the plane black.  As far as your answer, the aircraft is heated by the air flowing over it (convection), at cruising speed the air on much the surface would be over 600 degrees F (rough calculation). If you don't have a cooling system (very effective radiation cooling or the fuel heat dump system), you will cook the pilot."
MachinePorn,2vbx2n,Datsoon,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:52:04 2015 UTC,"Well it's not convection heating, it's skin friction heating. The air is very cold, but compressible and friction effects cause it to heat the aircraft surface."
MachinePorn,2vbx2n,Raptorpowered,1 point,Tue Feb 10 05:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no, sorry. Your answer was not only simple and complete, but incorrect. Your response is now also incorrect.   The plane was heated by skin friction, not convection from the air around it. The air around the plane was actually very cold, albeit not very dense.   I'm not super familiar with the liquid cooling systems used in the plane, but mentioning details about them won't make you any more correct. Radiation and convection simply just don't work that way."
MachinePorn,2vbx2n,Datsoon,1 point,Tue Feb 10 08:50:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, crash course in heat transfer in compressible flows.  The only air that matters to the heating of the plane is the air that is touching it, the (cold) freestream is irrelevant. The air in the viscous boundary layer is stagnated at the surface of the plane due to the no slip condition. I would call this a compressibility effect not a viscous skin friction effect but whatever, it is easy to model with the isentropic temperature relation adding a recovery factor.   This hot gas establishes a thermal gradient towards the aircraft resulting in a flow of heat towards the A/C. This would normally be called forced convection since the moving air is a factor in the heat transfer but both the conductive and convective properties are important for Prandtl numbers close to 1, which is not unusual."

In aerospace, when assembling these planes a lot of care goes into making sure the area is clean and any loose material is taken care of. Spacecraft are built in clean rooms for this reason (among others)."

MachinePorn,2v40ji,Alpinestarhero,17,Sat Feb 14 21:06:56 2015 UTC,"From I am Austin Fowler and I’m research advances in superconducting quantum bits for reliable quantum computation, AMA:   A quantum computer is not a high throughput or high classical memory device, rather they are designed to solve specific computational problems that are intractable on existing and future computers, including systems such as ""The Machine"". While the throughput of HP’s device is spectacular, if you have some function f(x) that takes a 1000 bit input and produces a 1000 bit output and you need to compute some collective property of all of the possible outputs, then no classical device, even one built out of all the matter in the universe (there are roughly 2300 atoms in the universe) will successfully compute and store more than a tiny fraction of the 21000 outputs.  In contrast, given 2000 quantum bits, it takes a single operation on each of the first thousand qubits, all of which can be done simultaneously, to store every possible input in this register. The function f(x) can then be applied to this register and every possible output stored in the second thousand qubits. Operations can then be applied to this register to attempt to extract the property of these collective outputs that is interesting. This is essentially how Shor’s efficient quantum factoring algorithm works. No classical device is ever expected to be able to operate in this manner."

MachinePorn,2v40ji,Thornaxe,2,Mon Feb 9 22:30:38 2015 UTC,I wonder what special materials are needed to support the temperature. That looks like standard waxed cord tying the cables.
MachinePorn,2v40ji,MasterFubar,4,Sun Feb 8 01:04:51 2015 UTC,"Waxed cord is often used in cryogenic systems to tie down wires where contamination of sensitive surfaces (like camera focal planes) is not a big concern (fun fact: people often use dental floss, though it loses its minty smell after it gets pumped out. The low vapor pressure of wax means that it doesn't get sucked off the surface and into the environment too much.  Wires are typically low-thermal-conductivity manganin or phosphor bronze to minimize the heat leaking from warmer stages to colder ones; at extremely low temperatures niobium-titanium superconducting wires are commonly used.  Structural/thermally conducting materials are typically OFHC/OFE copper (C10100/C10200) or various aluminum alloys -- ultra-pure (1100 alloy) aluminum is often used for thermal links where weight is a concern, whereas more typical alloys (5052, 6061, etc) are more often used for structural parts to be welded or machined that don't need the ultimate in thermal conductivity but still need to be ""pretty good.""  Structural/thermally-isolating materials are typically poor thermal conductivity metals like 304 stainless steel or titanium 6AL-4V. When even lower thermal conductivity is needed, certain plastics and/or composites can be used, like Nylon, Ultem, G-10 glass-fiber/epoxy composite, some carbon fiber composites, and Vespel engineering plastics.  Gold and other metallic plating is used to lower the emissivity of surfaces so they don't absorb as much thermal radiation from warmer surfaces. As a bonus, gold plating a surface often lowers the thermal resistance at bolted joints."

MachinePorn,2v40ji,bassowski,2,Sun Feb 8 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what material the wires are, maybe manganin, but what you see is most likely gold plated C101 copper and 304 stainless steel.  The 4 heat exchangers (called ""discrete heat exchangers"") you see between the bottom plate and the second to bottom plate (called ""mixing chamber"" and ""cold plate"") are packed with silver powder (they are in the middle and look like UFOs). The heat exchanger in the previous stage is nothing but a tube in tube HE."

MachinePorn,2v40ji,MrRandomSuperhero,3,Sun Feb 8 11:36:12 2015 UTC,"Yup. The ""temperature"" of space is defined as the thermal radiation environment that you are in (rather than being defined by statistical properties of the extremely tenuous/diffuse amount of gas in space). The radiation environment is due to the cosmic microwave background, a relic from the big bang that has a thermal radiation spectrum characteristic of a 2.725 K blackbody. So 100 times colder than that is 0.02725 K -- or within 27 milliKelvin of absolute zero."

They are built with quick cornering in mind, a IRS allows for camber adjustment helping the tires from rolling under fast corners.   NHRA, exclusively, uses solid axles for their higher strength, and lower resistance, and they travel faster than your F1 cars.   Stock cars, also, are built with solid axles because they are built with sustained high speeds in mind, and sustained turns (as opposed to quick corners in F1).   You'll also see the more successful land speed cars with solid axles.   In summary, ""race chassis"" does not necessarily mean ""F1 chassis"""

MachinePorn,2uunkc,newgenome,4,Thu Feb 5 07:32:36 2015 UTC,"Jesus.  what a waste.  Robotics are cool, but this is worthless.  first off, the cameras are a joke. NOTHING is visible in an engineering space fire.  They're probably only effective for locating the fire by heat detecting vision (infra-red maybe?) but that's not going to help this monstrosity navigate the INSANE maze of pipes, ladders, scaffolds, low overhangs, high steps, aux machinery, controls, bottomless pits, and many other obstacles.  Now that COULD be mitigated by an unbelievably (literally) accurate internal map and bearing-finder, but that won't help at all, because the watch-stander was tearing apart the purifier when it went down and that shit is fucking everywhere.  IF this unholy monument to wasted grant money has some sort of sonar thingy that finds out-of-place objects, then hats off, but if it misses and takes a tumble to the bilge, it's no more than a really expensive sea story.  What makes ship-board fire-fighting work is communication, faith in your equipment, ship mates, and a fear of  death.  and I ask you this, ""Why the fuck does this thing have legs in the first place?""  If this soulless sailor on a mission to King Neptune has a) fire finding vision, b) map of space c) debris detectors, then why not just make him an installed AFFF/Halon nozzle with a track and a turret and call it good?    8/10 would allow it to jerk me off on watch."
MachinePorn,2uunkc,PeteFord,16,Thu Feb 5 14:38:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that it probably isn't as effective as it should be to really warrant it's usage as an active duty firefighting robot on ships, but it's not a waste of money. The engineering challenges solved, data collected, and the experience gained by those working on this complex project are all worth significantly more than the dollar cost put in. Research is research, it helps to have a goal in mind, but just the fact that they have constructed this so far in incredibly impressive. This isn't a project from a defense company, it's being done at a research and technical university to teach students the most important lessons they can learn - hands on development of a real device."
MachinePorn,2uunkc,ConfusedWeasel,9,Thu Feb 5 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"As ConfusedWeasel pointed out, the firefighting capability is what was funding this research. It is an extremely complex problem to walk on two legs, and this robot uses a state-of-the-art whole-body control approach that very few groups in the world have been able to implement on a humanoid.  In regards to your bashing the vision system, remember that the human visual spectrum is only a small portion of what the robot can see. The sensor suite includes a spinning laser range finder (Lidar), stereo RGB (visual spectrum), and stereo IR. It then fuses this data to build a map of the world. The IR allows the robot to pinpoint the hottest parts of the fire, even through smoke.   Yes, robots still have a seriously long way before they can meet your high expectations, but this currently is the state of the art in humanoid robotics. Furthermore, the money put into this development is orders of magnitude less than comparable robots.  Edit: why two legs? Why a humanoid approach? Good luck getting a wheeled or tracked platform up those stairs and across the high ""knee-knockers"" that are ubiquitous on ships. I'm not saying it can't be done, but maintaining a humanoid design allows it to operate in a human-structured environment  and utilize tools designed for humans. Yes bipedal locomotion is insanely difficult, but research like this is what leads to the future. Look at the DARPA grand challenge - 10 years ago it was a ridiculous task to make a self-driving vehicle and now there is the google car for sale."

Also, you apparently have no knowledge of vision systems in hostile environments.  Human visual spectrum is only a tiny part of what machine vision consists of.

The most efficient engine with the longest range was actually the steam car. Unfortunately the steam boilers needed to heat up and pressurise before you could drive anywhere, so people preferred the 'jump in and go' factor of the gas and electric cars. Gas cars were only better than electric at the time in terms of range, but this did make them more popular, and because they were the most poplular, they were the engines the big companies used for their vehicles (Ford in the USA), and that set the trend we still see today."
MachinePorn,2urwrt,Fifth5Horseman,4,Wed Feb 4 22:43:31 2015 UTC,I kind of want a steam car. You could keep the boiler warm by utilising the excess capacity to generate electricity and heat for your house.
MachinePorn,2urwrt,formerwomble,5,Thu Feb 5 14:12:46 2015 UTC,"How do you define ""work""? EVs worked just fine at the time. There weren't commonly highways between cities yet. An average EV had a range of sixty to one hundred miles, made possible despite primitive batteries by the fact that the vehicles were largely wood and leather and so weighed very little, and had a maximum speed of around twenty to thirty miles per hour. Ample for city usage. They were winning the vehicular ""format war"" until intercity highways began to appear in significant number, requiring much faster vehicles with much greater range.  Although, this is beside the point since the scooter pictured is actually powered by a small gasoline engine. The fuel tank is plainly visible."

With all boilers firing the Titanic produced around 46,000 horsepower. The furnaces required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shoveled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 firemen working around the clock. 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea.

MachinePorn,2unlxm,vonHindenburg,5,Tue Feb 3 20:14:23 2015 UTC,Freaking interesting stuff!! Could you please explain what exactly is a thrust bearing and what it is used for?
MachinePorn,2unlxm,ringmaker,18,Tue Feb 3 21:35:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry for spending so much time on that, but I work for a company that builds steam turbines and I used to purchase bearings for them.  Hence my fascination.  On a propeller-powered ship, the propeller generates thrust, which is transferred along the prop shaft and must somehow be then transferred to the hull of the ship.  On a sailing ship, this is easy.  The thrust is transferred down the masts and stay ropes, which are rigidly attache to the hull.  On a prop-driven ship, things get a little more difficult.  The propeller shaft has to transfer thrust to the hull of the ship while still spinning freely in relation to that hull.  Thus the thrust bearing.    The piece which you see sitting out would be installed as part of the propeller shaft.  The ridges on it (called thrust collars) push against the ridges that you can see in the hole in the deck surrounding the installed bearing.  These ridges are mounted strongly on the frame of the ship and transfer the thrust to it.    Now, of course, you can't have metal scraping directly on metal, or you'll lose a ton of efficiency, build up heat, and grind away at the parts.  Therefore, you need to have a film of oil between them that prevents this.    Modern thrust bearings are machined in such a way that they draw oil up out of the sump that they sit in (as does this one) and spread it evenly over their surfaces.  How this one worked, I don't know....  They must've just used an oil that was hella viscus and constantly poured new over the top."
MachinePorn,2unlxm,vonHindenburg,2,Tue Feb 3 22:36:57 2015 UTC,Whale oil.
MachinePorn,2unlxm,cunninghamslaws,3,Wed Feb 4 04:20:33 2015 UTC,"Doubtful.  By the 1890's, petroleum had pretty much supplanted whale oil even in the latter's old stronghold of lighting.  It was definitely the entirety of the market for lubricants."
MachinePorn,2unlxm,vonHindenburg,2,Wed Feb 4 04:24:45 2015 UTC,Castor oil.
MachinePorn,2unlxm,mover_of_bridges,2,Wed Feb 4 09:43:07 2015 UTC,"Good point.  I never even thought of that.  Glancing at the Wiki, it is used mostly in engines which are frequently rebuilt, such as racing engines, due to its tendency to quickly form into a ‘gum’.  This would seem to contraindicate its use in a propeller shaft that would turn continuously for weeks on end."
MachinePorn,2unlxm,smitty981,5,Wed Feb 4 12:45:57 2015 UTC,"Didn't look at the album, but a thrust bearing on a ship is usually used as a reaction point to oppose the axial force generated in the propeller shaft by the propeller.  Generally, thrust bearings are used to describe any bearing designed to take an axial load (as opposed to radial bearings, for radial loads)."
MachinePorn,2unlxm,vonHindenburg,2,Tue Feb 3 22:09:23 2015 UTC,That's in San Diego Penn's Landing right?  I was on it about a year ago. edit:  my memory is going...

MachinePorn,2unlxm,DirtyBurger00,3,Wed Feb 4 01:55:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of the coal itself, would have been ash to begin with. Nowadays, coal is 'washed' before being powdered an injected into coal furnaces at power stations.  When you dig coal up, it's full of stuff that's already been burnt - ash. Usually, it's a significant portion. So, you get rid of that stuff, before sending it to be burned. These guys were just shoveling raw lumps straight in."
MachinePorn,2unlxm,electric_machinery,4,Tue Feb 3 22:47:32 2015 UTC,"Calculated at an even 600 tons/day for the 24 boilers, that's about 39 lbs. of coal per boiler, per minute. Wow."

MachinePorn,2unlxm,kliff0rd,2,Thu Feb 5 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"I think we can see the barring engine in this picture - see the worm gear on the flywheel? That would be cranked if the drive was stopped in dead center. If a steam engine stops in dead center, it is unable to restart itself."
MachinePorn,2unlxm,vonHindenburg,3,Tue Feb 3 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"This is only true of single cylinder steam engines. Engines with more than one cylinder typically had the rods connected at least 90° apart on the crankshaft, in part to prevent dead center starts."
MachinePorn,2unlxm,kliff0rd,4,Tue Feb 3 22:34:20 2015 UTC,"However, a triple expansion engine does need to be rotated to start from the right point in its cycle.  The small engine is also there to rotate the main engine for maintenance.  The turbine would have one as well which performs sort of the opposite function.  As a turbine rotor heats up, it sags a bit.  When the steamflow is cut off, a small engine is used to keep the rotor turning while it cools.  This prevents the rotor from 'freezing' with a permanent bend in the shaft."
MachinePorn,2unlxm,vonHindenburg,3,Wed Feb 4 02:59:53 2015 UTC,"In addition to single cylinder engines, I've worked with both double and triple expansion engines.  The smallest double expansion is 254hp, the largest is a 1500hp triple expansion. None of them had barring engines, and double and triple expansion engines do not require them to start.  Some may have been fitted with them for maintenance if the engine was very large, but they're certainly not required for operation.  Starting procedure is as simple as setting the reverser and opening the regulator.  The larger engine is in a ferry, and had to work all day everyday for decades with frequent starting and stopping.

(He knew that triple expansion engines were better....  Just not what they were better than or why....)  At any rate, here's Olympia's barring engine/jacking gear.    Where've you had the chance to work on engines that large?  EDIT:  That's it!  There's a video somewhere of these massive, 3 story-tall water pumping triple expanders in England somewhere on Youtube.  They explain in the video that the jacking gear needs to rotate the main engine into the proper starting position."
MachinePorn,2unlxm,vonHindenburg,3,Wed Feb 4 03:54:58 2015 UTC,"Triple expansions are better in that they're more efficient.  They'll use more of the energy in the same amount of steam than a single cylinder, multiple cylinder non-expansion, or double expansion engine will.    On a triple expansion engine, the cranks are 120° from each other on the shaft for smooth operation and to ensure that the engine should always start on its own without the help of a jacking engine.  I worked on engine in a number of places, but the largest is the triple expansion steam engine aboard the ferryboat Berkeley at the San Diego Maritime Museum.  You can see a small part of it here.  That beam above the telegraphs is about 8-9 feet above the deck, to give you some scale.  She was one of the first ferries in the US to be built with a triple expansion engine and propellers."

I was on the sail crew at the Museum, so let's not get too hasty about ditching sails.  It also had a lot to with the availability of coal.  As more coaling stations opened up in far flung parts of the globe, steam became more viable.  But some routes continued to be serviced by sail for a long time.  If you go to the Museum, you'll see the center piece of the collection, the Star of India.  She worked under sail until she was retired in 1926.  You'll also see the steam yacht Medea.  Launched in 1904, she still has her original double expansion steam engine.  Notably, she is one of two surviving vessels to have served in both World Wars, and one of three surviving Edwardian steam yachts in the world.  She operates several times a month under her own steam for charters, events, regattas, etc.  In 2011 she raced Cangarda, one of the other three Edwardian yachts and won.  Happy to answer questions"

The difference is that instead of there having to get enough short beans built up til it hits the table auger (and then goes in as a wad), they lay back on the belt which is right behind the cutterbar and feed evenly.  Even with tall beans, they lay back and go in inline with the feederhouse, which is much smoother. The table auger usually turns them sideways and stuffs them in.   When we were shopping for one, they told us you could pick up 2+ more bu/ac because the head is gentle enough that there's very little threshing on the head.  Our first was a MacDon FD70, now we have a JD 640FD.

MachinePorn,2u8cky,DrStickyPete,15,Fri Jan 30 21:58:26 2015 UTC,"Part 1  Science 23 January 2015:  Vol. 347 no. 6220 pp. 363-365  DOI: 10.1126/science.347.6220.363 FEATURE Probing the proton Adrian Cho*  Hall A here at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility is everything a science fan could want from a physics lab. The cylindrical cavern, 24 meters from floor to dome and twice as wide, echoes like a cathedral. From high on the wall, a silvery pipe extends fingerlike to the center, from which fan out two vast machines, multitiered assemblages of steel, pipes, wires, and electronics that sweep up to the roof.  Think of it all as part of a giant electron microscope, designed to probe two of the most familiar yet mysterious constituents of the universe: the proton and the neutron. The pipe carries a beam of high-energy electrons from an accelerator, which smash into targets mounted at the room's center. The hall's two 1400-tonne spectrometers capture the subatomic particles blasted from the collisions, tracking their paths and energies. For 20 years, Jefferson Lab physicists have battered the nucleus without quite cracking its secrets. But starting this year, they will train a more powerful microscope on their quarry.  In the cartoon view, the positively charged proton and the uncharged neutron both consist of trios of particles called up quarks and down quarks. (Two ups and a down make a proton; two downs and an up make a neutron.) But earlier experiments have shown that those “valence” quarks are just a small part of the story. A nucleon—a proton or neutron—is really a pullulating mass of countless quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, particles that convey the strong nuclear force that holds quarks together. A proton or neutron is so messy that physicists can't say exactly how its most basic properties, such as its mass and spin, emerge from the tangle.  Jefferson Lab physicists are finishing a $338 million upgrade to their particle accelerator, the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), to double its energy and probe the innards of protons and neutrons with unprecedented precision. Compared with meccas of particle physics such as CERN, Europe's particle physics lab near Geneva, Switzerland, Jefferson Lab is relatively obscure. But it will be the global focal point for this sort of nuclear physics. “It will be a very exciting program,” says Fabienne Kunne, a physicist at the French Atomic Energy Commission in Saclay, who is not involved with the project. “It should make enormous progress.”  Unlike particle physicists' quest for the famed Higgs boson, spotted in 2012 at CERN, Jefferson Lab's mission requires not one grand experiment but a mosaic of measurements. The diversity shows in the lab's four experimental halls: Two, including Hall A, feature spectrometers that can be reconfigured to study specific interactions, and two contain detectors designed to capture every interaction so that they can be sorted out later. “Jefferson Lab is a little bit more Wild West,” says Cynthia Keppel, a physicist who oversees the two spectrometer halls. “You've got settlers coming in from all over with all manner of ideas.”"
MachinePorn,2u8cky,DrStickyPete,12,Fri Jan 30 23:13:40 2015 UTC,"Part 2  The mess inside a nucleon arises from the peculiar nature of the strong force. At first blush, that force works something like the electromagnetic force, which binds electrons to nuclei in atoms and produces light. Within an atom, the negatively charged electrons cling to the positively charged nucleus by exchanging massless quantum particles called photons. In the same way, the quarks within the nucleon cling to one another by exchanging massless particles called gluons, which carry the strong force.  But the strong force is far more complex than the electromagnetic force. Unlike the passive photons, gluons themselves exchange gluons—lots of them. Moreover, a nucleon's three valence quarks aren't the only ones inside it. Untold quark-antiquark pairs also flit into and out of existence. Those fleeting “sea” quarks need not be up and down quarks, but can be heavier strange and charm quarks, too. Thus, each valence quark is shrouded by a cloud of quarks and gluons in which “what you see depends on the scale at which you look,” says Michael Pennington, chief theorist at Jefferson Lab.  That complexity makes calculating anything involving the strong force nearly impossible. For example, most of a nucleon's mass comes not from the valence quarks, but from the energy of the quark-gluon cloud (thanks to Einstein's equivalence of mass and energy). But only recently have theorists accounted for it in numerical simulations (Science, 19 December 2008, p. 1772). As for nucleons' spin, physicists once thought it came from the spins of the valence quarks. But since 1987, they have known that most of it must originate in some other way—either in the swirling motion of the quarks or in the gluons.  Unfortunately, physicists can't decipher nucleons by simply taking them apart. The strong force is so strong that they can't isolate a quark or a gluon the way they might pluck an electron from an atom. Strike a nucleon hard enough to smash it, and it will spew particles containing either three quarks or a quark-antiquark pair, forcing researchers to tease information from those composite particles instead.  The “confinement” of quarks and gluons within other particles remains mysterious, says Colin Morningstar, a theorist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Experiments and numerical simulations leave little doubt that it holds, but nobody has proved mathematically that it must or explained how the “field” of gluons arranges itself to make it happen. The Clay Mathematics Institute in Providence offers a $1 million prize for a proof. “I've demonstrated it numerically,” Morningstar quips, “but they haven't sent me a check.”  Jefferson Lab physicists are hardly the first to try to pierce the confusion. From 1967 until 1975, physicists at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, California, used their linear accelerator to fire electrons into nucleons, discovering the quark in 1968. Since 1978, physicists at CERN have fired muons—heavier, unstable cousins of electrons—into nucleons, discovering the proton's “spin crisis.” From 1992 to 2007, researchers at Germany's Electron Synchrotron lab in Hamburg collided beams of electrons and protons in their Hadron Electron Ring Accelerator.  But those efforts raised as many questions as they answered, Pennington says. “It's a little bit like the discovery of North America,” he says. “These other experiments showed that there was something there, and we're going to map it out.” Jefferson Lab physicists say the CEBAF accelerator is the ideal tool for the job.  Instead of a traditional circular accelerator or synchrotron, CEBAF consists of twin 235-meter linear accelerators, like the straights on a racetrack, connected by arcing beamlines. The electrons make five laps, passing through a different set of arcs each lap. The resulting beam has an extremely narrow range of energies, says Arne Freyberger, Jefferson Lab's director of accelerator operations. That narrow energy spread enables physicists to precisely measure the changes in a scattered electron's energy and momentum. And because the beam is continuous rather than pulsed like most accelerator beams, particle collisions don't bunch up in time, enabling researchers to use timing techniques to sift out rare decays.  Just to build CEBAF, which turned on in 1995 and cost $515 million, Jefferson Lab helped pioneer a whole new technology. Within an accelerator, charged particles gain energy by surfing radio waves sloshing in hollow “RF cavities” the size of a big salami. Until the 1990s, accelerators used copper cavities, but Jefferson Lab physicists opted for cavities of superconducting niobium. Although they must be cooled to near absolute zero with liquid helium, they consume just 5% as much power as copper cavities, says Robert Rimmer, an accelerator physicist at Jefferson Lab. “For a machine like CEBAF, you couldn't afford the power bill if you used copper cavities,” he says. Superconducting cavities have become standard for accelerators.  In upgrading CEBAF, physicists doubled the accelerator's energy from 6 to 12 gigaelectron volts simply by adding new cavities in empty space at the end of each linac. That extra energy will be a boon to the more than 70 experiments approved for the upgraded machine, most of which are devoted to fathoming the nucleon. In particular, the energy will literally add new dimensions to physicists' picture of nucleons.  For decades, physicists have made do with essentially one-dimensional views of nucleons. Ping electrons off a nucleon gently, and their deflections reveal the distribution of the quarks within—but only perpendicular to electrons' original path. Strike the nucleon hard enough to break it apart, and the electrons' deflections and energy losses will reveal the momenta of quarks and gluons within the nucleon—but only along the electrons' initial path.  In nuclear physics, higher energy means finer resolution. So the upgraded CEBAF will enable physicists to trace the distribution of the quarks' position and momentum in three dimensions. To do so, they must capture not only scattered electrons, but also other particles that shoot out of certain rare collisions. For example, Julie Roche of Ohio University, Athens, and colleagues will focus on a process in which an electron interacts with a quark by exchanging a photon that then rebounds out of the interaction. Working in the lab's Hall A, they aim to capture both the electron and the photon.  Tracking quarks in three dimensions would probe their swirling motion and could help explain the nucleon's spin. It would mark a “major advance” that could help unify physicists' understanding of the strong force, says Amanda Cooper-Sarkar, a physicist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom who does not work at Jefferson Lab.  For other clues to the strong force, Jefferson Lab researchers will look for new, exotic particles made of quarks and gluons. Physicists know of only two general kinds of particles cemented by the strong force: baryons, which contain three quarks or three antiquarks, and mesons, made of a quark-antiquark pair. But simulations suggest other combinations are possible. Particles called glueballs would consist entirely of gluons, and “hybrid” mesons and baryons would contain an extra “valence” gluon. They would have distinctive combinations of mass, spin, and symmetry properties that would show through in their decays."
MachinePorn,2u8cky,fredrodgers,11,Fri Jan 30 23:15:04 2015 UTC,"Part 3  A dedicated detector called GlueX housed in the new Hall D will search for those odd particles. GlueX researchers will first fire the CEBAF electron beam into a diamond crystal to produce polarized high-energy photons. These will then crash into a liquid hydrogen target to produce particles familiar and novel. If newcomers appear, the GlueX team aims to study the pattern of their properties, says Eugene Chudakov, a physicist at Jefferson Lab who oversees Hall D. “You cannot say anything [about the theory] if you see only one,” he says. “You really need to be able to see several.”  Jefferson Lab physicists will also explore a long-standing mystery: why an isolated proton or neutron behaves differently from one in a nucleus. In 1983, researchers with the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) at CERN fired muons both into deuterium nuclei, which contain one proton and one neutron, and into iron nuclei, which contain 26 protons and typically 30 neutrons. In theory, the momentum distribution of the quarks should be the same in the nucleons in each nucleus. Instead, researchers found a deficit of higher momentum quarks in the larger one. That “EMC effect” is unexplained.  Or Hen of Tel Aviv University in Israel and Douglas Higinbotham of Jefferson Lab have an idea of how it comes about. In 2008, researchers working in Hall A found that in the nucleus of carbon-12, the six protons and six neutrons tend to form fleeting proton-neutron pairs. Last October, they spotted similar pairs in heavier nuclei, too. The paired particles overlap spatially, and the commingling of their quark-gluon clouds could cause the EMC effect.  To test that idea, the physicists will fire electrons from CEBAF into deuterium nuclei to probe the quarks inside the neutron. The electrons will also break up the nuclei. In each event, measuring the momentum of the recoiling proton should tell physicists how much the proton and neutron in the nucleus overlapped when the electron struck. If the number of high-momentum quarks in the neutron decreases when the neutron and proton overlap more, then such pairing could explain the EMC effect, Hen says.  Will the upgraded CEBAF completely decipher the proton and the neutron? Not quite. The machine should be adept at mapping the quarks. But to fully probe the gluons will require higher energy collisions than CEBAF can muster. Jefferson Lab researchers now hope to build a second accelerator that would fire protons or nuclei into their electron beam, boosting the collision energies. But they have competition: Physicists at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, want to build an electron-ion collider by adding an electron accelerator to their $1.1 billion 4-kilometer-long atom smasher, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (Science, 19 October 2012, p. 324).  Wherever it winds up, such a machine is at least a decade away. For now, the Department of Energy has asked both labs to work together on developing the science case for building one, says Jefferson Lab Director Hugh Montgomery: “Unless we can convince people that it's worth doing this, there's no point in discussing where it could be built.” Meanwhile, Jefferson Lab physicists are ready to ramp up their new experiments. For the proton, clarity may be coming."

MachinePorn,2u74th,SuperConductiveRabbi,6,Fri Jan 30 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"I consider it amazing that NASA was able to adapt and configure two shuttles for launch simultaneously. One of the most complicated machines in the world, and they put two of them side-by-side."
MachinePorn,2u74th,evasote,3,Fri Jan 30 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"I thought they always prepped two, but only launched one. The other was to act as a rescue craft if necessary"
MachinePorn,2u74th,SuperConductiveRabbi,15,Fri Jan 30 20:49:56 2015 UTC,"They only started prepping two as a response to the Columbia disaster, as ltjpunk387 pointed out below.  It's interesting to note that there was considerable debate within the Columbia's accident review board as to whether or not NASA would've been able to rescue the ill-fated crew. They concluded, as I recall, that it would've been hypothetically possible if the crew immediately reduced their activity to nothing more than sleeping all day, prolonged their stay to something like thirty days, and if the NASA engineers entered into an emergency crash course of prepping a second shuttle. I seem to remember someone saying that had any single thing gone wrong in the complicated dance that comprises the prepping and mating of the external fuel tank and SRBs, the crew would've been doomed. Even if they managed to launch a shuttle, the rescue operation would've been a harrowing drama involving a half dozen space walks. And on top of all that, the rescue crew had to launch with the knowledge that the foam strike that doomed the Columbia could just as easily happen to them!  Even more tangential, they also hypothesized that the crew could've performed an untethered space walk to stuff the hole in the wing with random junk and tape in a desperate effort to keep the superheated air from entering it. They also devised modified S-curves that kept as much pressure off that part of the wing as possible."
MachinePorn,2u74th,KosherNazi,3,Fri Jan 30 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"Can the Soyuz be prepped any faster?  Is there a chance one of them could have been sent up in time?  Or maybe there was one already close to launch at the time?  I don't know what their launch schedule was at the time.  The Soyuz can dock with the shuttle, right?"
MachinePorn,2u74th,SuperConductiveRabbi,5,Fri Jan 30 22:49:56 2015 UTC,"I imagine they investigated that scenario, but I don't recall. The question would be, I suppose, what to do once the Soyuz goes up there. Even if it was a fully automated rendezvous, the Soyuz only fits three.  Edit: I found this in the CAIB's Volume II, Appendix D.13:    There has been some discussion regarding the possibility of sending supplies to Columbia using an expendable launch vehicle – to lengthen the amount of time available to ex- ecute a rescue mission. Because of Columbiaʼs 39-degree orbital inclination, an expendable launch from a launch site with a latitude greater than 39 degrees would not be able to reach Columbia. This rules out a Soyuz/Progress launch. There was an Ariane 4 in French Guiana that successfully launched an Intelsat satellite on February 15. The challenge with developing a supply kit, building an appropriate hous- ing and separation system, and reprogramming the Ariane seems very difficult in three weeks, although this option is still in work.   As there is nothing inherently impossible about doing a rendezvous with an artificial satellite orbiting with ANY orbital inclination, I think we have to assume that the author means the costly plane change maneuver is beyond the capabilities of the Soyuz and its launch vehicle.  Edit edit: Here's a good ballpark for what the plane change maneuver would require:    The Columbiaʼs 39 degree orbital inclination could not have been altered to the ISS 51.6 degree inclination without ap- proximately 12,600 ft/sec of translational capability. Colum- bia had 448 ft/sec of propellant available."

MachinePorn,2u74th,ltjpunk387,9,Sun Feb 1 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"After some digging on Wikipedia: After the Columbia disaster, all shuttle missions had a contingency plan in case of a malfunction. In almost all cases, this involved remaining docked with the ISS until a rescue craft could retrieve them.   This mission, STS-125 was going to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, on a very different orbit from ISS. The only possibility of rescue would be a second shuttle, which would need to be ready to launch immediately since the shuttle cannot support astronauts for extended periods of time."

MachinePorn,2u1jl6,mollymoo,5,Thu Jan 29 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"-5/+20 seconds per day is what you'll find in consumer mechanicals. To be certified by the COSC as a Chronometer you have to do -2/+6.   Accuracy is relative, chronometers are incredibly accurate for a mechanical device, but quartz wins every time. The allure is that mechanical movements will run pretty much forever if treated right and kept wound and that the watches they power tend to be heirloom quality.  I own both mechanical and quartz pieces, and I tend to prefer mechanical. They keep fine time and are far more interesting - quartz is precise but soulless."

MachinePorn,2u1jl6,joewith,1 point,Thu Jan 29 06:35:01 2015 UTC,"If you two have a thing going, I'm certainly fine with that.  Ask him to leave me out of it though, would ya?  I'm not part of it and don't want to be.  Back to the subject - that movement is sexy as hell.  It's obvious that they put much thought and good engineering into it.  The addition of color is a nice touch, and the labels are thoughtful.  They HAVE to mount this in a display back.  Hiding all of that would be a crime.  The gold parts carry the ""750"" tag, implying 18K gold - at least plating, but likely solid.  The balance wheel itself is labeled ""Si 14"" which is obviously silicon.  I own a pocket watch that was built in the 1800's.  I think it was built in 1886.  It has none of this technology in it, but it runs and keeps reasonably accurate time for something that's over 125 years old.  Not nearly this accurate, but I like the look and feel of it.  And it's simple - three hands and twelve numerals.  Still, I'd like to have this beauty on my wrist and my antique in my pocket.  :o)"
MachinePorn,2u1jl6,mrmhm,2,Thu Jan 29 06:46:16 2015 UTC,Most advanced movement but no tourbillon?
MachinePorn,2u1jl6,grzelbu,9,Thu Jan 29 07:25:05 2015 UTC,Tourbillons have a negligible effect on accuracy and their benefits can be achieved with other techniques. They are beautiful but they are more of a watchmaker's flourish than a requirement to be considered advanced.   Asking for a Tourbillon on 9301 (and I'm not saying you are) is like asking for water injection on a GE-90 turbofan.

MachinePorn,2u1jl6,grzelbu,2,Thu Jan 29 14:56:23 2015 UTC,If you never correct it yes. I synchronize whatever mechanical I'm wearing to atomic time in the morning when I put it on and during the course of the day the loss of accuracy is virtually unnoticeable.

MachinePorn,2tqt4s,Torgamous,2,Tue Jan 27 11:59:45 2015 UTC,"Operator error was definitely part of the problem. Reactors have to run above a certain power level to clear out the neutron poisons that develop within.  Because of this, the test they were running had a certain minimum power below which they couldn't run the plant.  What happened is that when they brought the power down they brought it down to something like 50MW when the target was closer to 700MW. They didn't want to lose the opportunity to run the test, so they tried to bring the power back up and lost control. They had a excursion up to something like 30,000MW in a plant that was rated for only 3,200MW thermal.  That's when they blew the top off the reactor and all hell broke loose.

It's not because of fossil fuel prices. It's due to post-soviet decline, lots of Russian territories in the arctic Siberia were practically abandoned and the demand for transporting goods/supplies over Northern sea route was about 5 times lower than it was in 80s.  Also some say it's global warming coming in and predict that at the current pace after couple of decades the Northern sea route would be traversable without icebreakers (so Suez channel would be not needed for most China-Europe routes).

MachinePorn,2tn4by,bloodmoneyXIII,3,Mon Jan 26 07:37:11 2015 UTC,Pls explain.
MachinePorn,2tn4by,henrysmith78730,2,Sun Jan 25 20:12:01 2015 UTC,"Well for one, ordinary natural gas contains many impurities so just freezing it isn't going to do the trick. The natural gas needs to be passed through solvents in order to get rid of some other impurities. The heat exchange process in which the gas is liquified in its self is very complex as well."
MachinePorn,2tn4by,1percentof1,-2,Sun Jan 25 20:16:58 2015 UTC,How so? Is it taking out anything that is not methane?
MachinePorn,2tn4by,henrysmith78730,1 point,Sun Jan 25 20:19:42 2015 UTC,Liquified natural gas does not only consist of methane (CH4).

MachinePorn,2tn4by,BuckminsterJones,3,Mon Jan 26 14:44:06 2015 UTC,I think we need a new word for this kind of vessel. Somehow.... it just doesn't feel like a 'ship' to me. It's too.... bargy. Worlds largest mobile industrial-platform? Something like that. I'm skeptical that that thing is truly open-sea-worthy. Not trying to disrespect this awesome machine. These mobile gas facilities are driving major changes.
MachinePorn,2tn4by,faux-name,5,Mon Jan 26 15:12:17 2015 UTC,Vessels like this are often referred to as FPSO's: Floating production storage and offloading or  FLNG's: Floating liquefied natural gas.  These are catch all terms and the and the line between ship and installation can be blurred.
MachinePorn,2tn4by,BuckminsterJones,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"Well that's not very catchy :)  I'm just saying... calling this thing a 'ship' is like calling a mobile-home a 'truck'.

MachinePorn,2tn4by,BuckminsterJones,1 point,Mon Jan 26 09:10:20 2015 UTC,"I think what they do is to wait for a calm weather forecast, and then they stay relatively close to shore so that if a storm pops up they can take shelter. I'm just guessing, but I live near the Texas coast where they build and move giant oil equipment, and that's what they do with oil platforms. They'll move things across the Atlantic, but they might have to wait weeks for calm weather, and not during hurricane season. That bow just isn't designed for big waves, I don't think."
MachinePorn,2tn4by,jdsutton,1 point,Mon Jan 26 02:51:47 2015 UTC,I'm skeptical that that thing is truly open-sea-worthy.    How so ? Just because it's big ?
MachinePorn,2tn4by,bettorworse,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:02:27 2015 UTC,"Because of the shape of the bow. In heavy seas, you have to point into the waves and plow through them, but that blunt nose?? A big wave would crush it, I'm guessing."
MachinePorn,2tn4by,BEST_USERNAME_EVA,2,Mon Jan 26 16:35:29 2015 UTC,Well.. it's going to be stationed off north western Australia where there's usually one or two category 4+ cyclones a year.

MachinePorn,2tn4by,nelliottca,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"No doubt. But like you say, it's going to move once, and then stay put for years and years. I'm sure they've got a nice sheltered cove for it."
MachinePorn,2tn4by,Womec,1 point,Mon Jan 26 06:02:47 2015 UTC,The whole point of the ship is so they don't have to build 200km of pipeline to the coast. It'll be in the open sea.

MachinePorn,2tkmni,merrell056,3,Mon Feb 9 15:30:37 2015 UTC,"When I worked in broadcast television in Oregon, a competitor's brand new HD satellite truck was out on its second or third story (if I recall -- this was 10+ years ago), and they were returning to the station when they decided to get gas. In Oregon, you are not permitted to pump your own gas. An attendant has to do it for you. The photog and reporter got out of the truck and told the kid to fill the truck with diesel, then went inside to get something to eat. As you know, but others reading might not, broadcast trucks have a number of holes in the side for feeding in cabling during live shoots and such, and all of them have a little sign above that says ""NO FUEL.""  Not too long later, the manager of the gas station ran inside to grab the photog, saying ""um, something is wrong with your truck,"" as diesel fuel poured out of the bottom and onto the pavement. The photographer realized exactly what had happened and slammed open the side door, and diesel rushed out of the door to greet him. On his first day on the job (you can't make this up), the 16-year-old kid had pumped more than 45 gallons of diesel into the interior of a several million dollar satellite truck.  Being a photog, he went for the camera first, since it was on the floor. Toast. Truck, toast; not a lot of people realize this, but gas pumps shoot like a projectile stream, and the first thing it hit was a rack full of uplink gear, amazingly powered off. Reporter's on-air attire, toast. Hazmat scene at the gas station. Yellow tape. News covering news. Good times. I think they ended up writing it off and claiming its full value."

If you choose a large single rotor platform such as a Gaui X7, which can carry a 12lb camera (Bottom left here) you should be able to get speeds of around the same amount if you tailor your build for it.  The current speed record for a single rotor RC helicopter is 275Kmh although, clearly this is pushing the limits without added camera equipment on board.  If you really wanted speed then you could mount a gimbal to the front of a large fixed wing model, and then you could achieve far greater speeds still.

Edit: Things to note though, your break out force (the bucket curling in) will be the same as a normal 650 series machine but because the Stick is long you could very well break the stick by doing so."

What we see here are the exhaust valves - there's no pipes, the exhaust comes out of the holes around the valves. The inlet valves are shown here, and as you can see, there's no inlet cam. Some early engines like this had very weak valve springs, so that the valves were sucked open rather than being forced open.  The engine used a ""surface carburettor"" - basically a pool of petrol over which the air was drawn so that it evaporated. I think that's the tray that the inlet valves poke through, but it might be the can sticking up behind them."

MachinePorn,2sto9x,mats852,27,Sun Jan 18 19:37:52 2015 UTC,I'll try to remember this image the next time I'm on a choppy flight. The planes look so fragile.
MachinePorn,2sto9x,nunyain,40,Sun Jan 18 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"I know, right? I look out the window and see the wings flexing and think, ""how much could they take before they broke?""  I now know the answer is ""A whole lot more."""
MachinePorn,2sto9x,doktorknow,18,Sun Jan 18 17:21:43 2015 UTC,If it doesn't bend it breaks.
MachinePorn,2sto9x,Duhya,12,Sun Jan 18 18:06:55 2015 UTC,Ehh it depends what application.  This is the reasoning cheap people use when they buy grade five bolts when they should have grade eight.  Grade five bends then breaks long before grade eight starts to bend.
MachinePorn,2sto9x,mynameisalso,2,Sun Jan 18 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"Grade 8 bolts do bend. They just don't bend very noticeably.  Hell, the bolts wouldn't even stay properly if they didn't stretch when threaded into things."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,P-01S,3,Sun Jan 18 23:30:30 2015 UTC,Grade 8 bolts will flex and return to their original shape at loads which will see a grade 5 bolt permanently bend and then fail.
MachinePorn,2sto9x,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Mon Jan 19 00:32:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a design flaw to me. In what scenario would a fastener be BENDING, and not simply failing in tension?"
MachinePorn,2sto9x,ozzimark,3,Mon Jan 19 01:57:56 2015 UTC,Usually due to an overload causing the parts to overcome the friciton in the joint and move; thus loading the bolt in shear and sometimes bending.
MachinePorn,2sto9x,Kiwibaconator,2,Mon Jan 19 02:45:37 2015 UTC,"Yup, that would be called a slip critical joint.    I'm using such a design to hold on a custom front suspension for my motorcycle.  5 1/2"" grade 8 bolts per side.  I have 7/16"" grade 9 bolts in some other places where I wanted to save weight but needed massive clamping pressure to create friction that would resist suspension and braking forces.  I maybe could have just welded it, but I wanted to make various mounting points and such easy to replace, to allow geometry changes."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,sebwiers,1 point,Mon Jan 19 04:07:41 2015 UTC,"In that case, it seems that a pin or dowel to take the shear loading would be preferred, leaving the bolt to apply clamping forces only."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,ozzimark,1 point,Mon Jan 19 13:28:44 2015 UTC,And that is why they are higher grade.  I was referring to elastic deformation.
MachinePorn,2sto9x,P-01S,3,Mon Jan 19 04:08:35 2015 UTC,Think about this too: those wings there are the only things holding the plane up in the sky.  They are suspending all the weight of the plane and its passengers.
MachinePorn,2sto9x,Lothar_Ecklord,3,Sun Jan 18 23:20:48 2015 UTC,Well this should make my flight next week a whole lot more fun.
MachinePorn,2sto9x,doktorknow,-11,Mon Jan 19 03:39:39 2015 UTC,"Well... Yes, but... Fatigue cracks from repeated stressing will tears leading to larger failures if unchecked. Just because something can be done once does not mean it can be done continuously for thousands of flight hours.  Also, be more afraid of being inside a pressurized canister roughly equivalent to a soda can. A crack two inches long once opened up and took the top front half of a plane off in flight, and that isn't even close to the worst depressurization accident."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,motoko_urashima,8,Sun Jan 18 18:55:34 2015 UTC,"As someone who works with this for a living, I can assure everyone that this commenter doesn't know what he's talking about."

Fatigue is an issue. Depressurization is an issue. How often that actually happens? No idea. Air travel is still the safest way to fly."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,motoko_urashima,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:09:02 2015 UTC,"if unchecked   Regulatory agencies such as the FAA, as well as common sense, demand that everything be checked. Airplane structure is not ""unchecked"".   A crack two inches long once opened up and took the top front half of a plane off in flight   False. The top half of the plane came off due to a large number of cracks. A single crack as long as twenty to sixty inches is not enough to down an airplane. Just ask the Mythbusters.  Besides, the Aloha accident to which you refer - and the Comet accidents, which are the only worse ones - happened during the ""dark ages"" before we knew how to properly analyze these phenomena. Before the Comet accident, fatigue analysis wasn't even required of airplane structure. Now it is. Before the Aloha accident, full-scale fatigue testing of new commercial airframes was not required. Now it is. So, from the point of view of understanding and predicting fatigue, we live in a different world than the world where those accidents happen. It is not reasonable to mention those accidents as something that might happen today.   for thousands of flight hours   Flight cycles are generally a more relevant metric here."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,airshowfan,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly what is the metric for ""the dark ages""? I mean, notable fatalities happened as recently as 2002. Granted, dramatic depressurization is usually a thing of the past, such as in 1985 1975 and 1974 (the '74 and '85 incidents being the two deadliest single-plane accidents in history) but it's more likely to die from it than from a terrorist bomb..  And here's one for giggles in 1990"
MachinePorn,2sto9x,motoko_urashima,1 point,Mon Jan 19 16:00:12 2015 UTC,"China 611 (2002) and Jal 123 were caused by bad repairs.  Guess what? Structural repairs did not use require fatigue and damage-tolerance analysis, and after these accidents, now they do. So, again, these are accidents that would probably not happen again today.  Yes, there is still the tiny possibility that bad workmanship might (1) happen, (2) pass quality control, and (3) cause fatigue that would not be caught by structural inspections. But that would be a really, really, really unlikely coincidence, for all those things to happen to the same detail on an airplane, i.e. for it to incorrectly ""pass"" all the requirements and checks that have been introduced in the wake of all these accidents. Yes, it can happen, but thanks to fail-safe design, it's still not fatal."

MachinePorn,2sto9x,ozzimark,1 point,Mon Jan 19 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"I agree! I pull about 3 g at least once during most flights when I'm on the pilot's seat ;]  (Seriously, though, airliners have a limit load of 2.5 g, which means that, beyond that, the wings might become bent, some rivets may pop off, etc. So I would not want to make it past 2.5 g in an airliner, even though they are certified to not experience catastrophic failure until 3.75 g. That 3.75 g ""ultimate"" requirement typically means that you can take an airliner to about 3 g without anything becoming permanently damaged, but... no way to guarantee that, the red line is at 2.5)."

MachinePorn,2sto9x,Dementat_Deus,7,Sun Jan 18 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yes to both of your questions. They do this to all planes, and they bend the wings until they break."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,TheStroupe,35,Sun Jan 18 14:33:54 2015 UTC,To clarify -- they do this to all plane models during development testing. They don't do it to every plane that comes off the assembly line once that model is in production.

MachinePorn,2sto9x,llsmithll,2,Sun Jan 18 15:39:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, thanks for clarifying that! It wouldn't be very profitable if they broke every plane..."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,TheStroupe,3,Sun Jan 18 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"Nope. The FAA needs three seconds at 150% limit load (i.e. the load that would provide 3.75 g worth of lift at max weight) without catastrophic failure. If the airplane survives 3 seconds, the test is over. You can now unload the wings... or keep loading the breaking point for the sake of curiosity (and verifying design/analysis methods)."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,airshowfan,1 point,Sun Jan 18 20:48:28 2015 UTC,"Do they have to test to destruction?  AFAIK, FAA guidelines just require being able to stand up to something like 153% of maximum loading (typically as determined by climb rate and gross aircraft weight).  Seems like that could be demonstrated without straining to the breaking point.  Although given you can't use the strain-tested parts afterwords, I guess it may make sense to just gather extra data by going past that point, to destruction... if your rig can manage it."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,sebwiers,1 point,Sun Jan 18 22:49:56 2015 UTC,"There's no way to verify the maximum stress it can take without breaking it. You can run all the simulations you want, but you have to test it in the real world to make sure they're correct."
MachinePorn,2sto9x,TheStroupe,1 point,Sun Jan 18 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"True, but afaik the regulations don't specify a required maximum, the specify a required minimum.  Why not test it to that minimum, and call it a day?   If nothing else, testing to failure requires a stronger test rig, costing some percent (likely small compared to other items) more.  My guess is they maybe are looking to see what the failure mode is- maybe it's required that the cabin remain intact or some such?"
MachinePorn,2sto9x,sebwiers,6,Sun Jan 18 20:50:26 2015 UTC,The airframe is a complete write-off at that point - may as well test it to failure so we know how close the simulations were.

MachinePorn,2sr2h1,LazyLooser,20,Sat Jan 17 19:58:15 2015 UTC,Centrifugal pump. Looks like a turbo housing for sure :)    These type of pumps can cause a heavy suction even if there's air in it and are more efficient with a large pump 'head' or height that that pump has to push material/liquid up to.
MachinePorn,2sr2h1,Beerificus,1 point,Sat Jan 17 22:20:02 2015 UTC,"Centrifugal pumps arent that great at creating suction. At least not in my experience.  Its fairly easy to get cavitation within the spinning ""fan"" and then it just freewheels in there. I kinda figured it was some manner of venturi nozzle setup that blew the mud/water slurry upward towards the barge."
MachinePorn,2sr2h1,Thornaxe,2,Mon Jan 19 06:20:31 2015 UTC,That would be the suction pump that takes the material to the surface. Snail shaped thing = volute.
MachinePorn,2sr2h1,Pink7172,4,Sat Jan 17 20:45:47 2015 UTC,well ... not really but kind of.   A turbo runs off engine exhaust gases. I can assure you that thing does not.   Altho it looks like a turbine housing of some sort. Perhaps it houses the impeller of a huge water pump that then in turn pumps the water.
MachinePorn,2sr2h1,LazyLooser,7,Sat Jan 17 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"That is almost exactly what it does, as explained in the title it pumps the muddy water up."
MachinePorn,2sr2h1,witteknokkels,3,Sat Jan 17 20:36:42 2015 UTC,"Im curious as to why they designed it with the pump at the bottom.

MachinePorn,2sr2h1,LazyLooser,4,Sat Jan 17 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"High suction pressure causes cavitation in the pump. Low pressure changes the state of water and starts to form gas bubbles. These gas bubbles collapse and release a ton of energy when it returns to it's liquid state. This energy release manifests itself as little dents on the pump parts that add up over time and can lead to serious damage.  You can take a pump and move it closer to what you're pumping to avoid this. It is a lot healthier to use the pump to push water, rather than pull it, that's why they put it at the nozzle in this image."

It sucks the mud up and over to the ""booster barge"" which I'm pretty sure is just a large pump attached to an EMD. The booster barge pushes the mud out to the dump site, which here is about .5 miles away I believe."
MachinePorn,2sr2h1,thegreybush,5,Tue Jan 20 01:46:18 2015 UTC,"The column of muddy water in a vertical pipe that long would be so much that a pump at the top would actually generate a vacuum before lifting the water.    Simply put, the pressure at the pump would be lower than the vapor pressure of water and the mud would begin to boil and the water simply won't flow up.  Placing the pump at the bottom creates a high pressure at the bottom rather than low pressure at the top."

He goes into great detail about the ramifications of the submarine campaign and how it ultimately pulled America into the war.    Previous to WWI, commerce raiding was done by well-armed ships which would force a merchantman to stop, board, determine its nationality, pull off the crew, and then scuttle the ship.  Initially, submarines attempted to follow this model.  Unfortunately, they had no space or crew to detain potentially hostile passengers and enemy crews.  Furthermore, they were extremely fragile things and, once the British began using Q ships (merchantmen with naval crews and hidden guns), the Germans could no longer risk surfacing and engaging with gunfire.    These factors, compounded with the problem of identifying a ship’s (possibly fake) flag from a dim periscope a few feet above the waves lead the Germans to declare the entire North Sea a battle zone in which any ship of any nationality might be fired upon.  It was this factor, which America saw as an unjust abrogation of its rights as a neutral, combined with the loss of American lives and ships from the submarine campaign that drew the nation into the war."

The machine is built for the job, does the job and then gets scrapped. During tunnel boring there is a lot of wear and tear to a lot of the complicated stuff like the drive mechanisms, the conveyor belts and other stuff.  Damage on the machine during a job can often only be temporarily patched due to the machine being surrounded by walls on all but one side. (BTW: Doing such temporary repairs can be quit time consuming. For example on the new Gothard tunnel in Switzerland, they work 24 hours around the clock. Around 18 hours of the day, the machine actually works, the remaining 6 hours are used for maintenance and other tasks that can't be done during normal operation).   Often, again mostly for bigger projects, specific diameters are required. Especially when you need to bore from several directions or parallel tunnels with the same dimensions it is quit hard to get hold off the number of used boring machines you need, so in the end they have to build specifically for the task anyway.   For a job like shorter tunnels the machine will probably be shipped back to a maintenance facility where the machine will be properly repaired after which it just is put into storage until there is the next job to do. But then again, nobody wants to pay for a machine that is not used, so it might be scrapped as well."

MachinePorn,2sdysf,Legs11,26,Thu Jan 15 01:04:32 2015 UTC,What's the benefit of a prop over a turbine engine?
MachinePorn,2sdysf,widelyunknown,162,Wed Jan 14 11:59:22 2015 UTC,"Props are more efficient at lower speeds, and generate prop wash over the wing allowing lower takeoff and landing speeds compared to an equivalent jet engine. They also are more resistant to foreign objects (fragile turbine blades are hidden behind a cowling, and sometimes a filter; by comparison prop blades are very sturdy and spinning much slower). Prop blades can be repaired and patched up, whereas turbine blades need immediate replacement with a complete new blade, in a heavy maintenance shop. The turbine exhaust can be made cooler than a similar turbofan's, making them harder to target with IR missiles (which is a very big concern for something like the A400M and C130, operating close to frontlines or in contested territory). In short, they're very good for getting troops and materiel close to frontlines, and being able to do so from unimproved or barely-improved airstrips, reliably, which is exactly what this plane is sold as doing.   Worth noting: these are actually turboprops, so they have a turbine powering a propeller, for higher power and power-to-weight ratios (and the ability to run and refuel from standard Jet-A rather than avgas) - strictly speaking, they're still ""turbine engines"" except that they drive an unenclosed prop, not an enclosed fan. The lines are a bit blurry though: most modern jet engines are turbofans of some description, meaning that they generate some of their power by sucking air through themselves (""bypass air"") and not using it for combustion, and some turbofans generate 80% or more of their thrust from bypass air; most turboprops do generate some thrust out of their exhaust (and therefore it's pointed backwards)."
MachinePorn,2sdysf,hexapodium,13,Wed Jan 14 12:49:15 2015 UTC,I thought the difference was just ducting although I suppose blade number is accurate too
MachinePorn,2sdysf,hwillis,69,Wed Jan 14 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"It's a historical definition as much as an engineering one: when the first turboprops were developed, they were up against turbojets, and the distinction was very simple: turboprops made most of their thrust from the prop pushing outside air, and turbojets made all of theirs from combustion products going through the engine and getting flung out the back. This was the case for the very earliest jets (around 1938), which weren't very efficient and didn't develop much power. (the turboprop hadn't been invented yet)  As jet technology improved (basically as soon it was flight-ready), jets were developed which would produce more power than just the core turbine could handle, and simultaneously the gas turbine was developed (the early 1940s), i.e. a jet engine where power was taken off by using a free turbine in the exhaust and used to drive a mechanical shaft. These were combined to produce the first turboshaft engines, and the first turboprops (1940 for the first ever, but it was abandoned in favour of a turbojet): a propeller attached to a turbine engine. These were much more efficient than their pure jet counterparts, and the first production turboprops (1945/6: Rolls Royce Dart and Hawker Siddely Python) were a huge hit. Hence, the historical distinction emerged between the turboprop and the turbojet - fan engines didn't exist at all.  As the efficiency gains were realised, designers then started looking for a way to produce engines which were as efficient as turboprops were at low speeds and altitudes, at higher speeds and altitudes. Furthermore, engines were becoming powerful enough that no propellers with contemporary technology could effectively soak up the power they produced, at design RPMs - the blade tips would go supersonic and destroy themselves, and the engines would overspeed. Gearboxes that were reliable and efficient enough at that sort of speed to allow reduction gearing on production engines had yet to be developed. Turbojets were also having the problem that they were limited by the mass flow that could be efficiently pushed into the engine; the core turbines were now spinning so fast that they were at the limit of materials science, and exhaust speeds were rising and becoming inefficient (more on this later).  Engineers fixed this problem by turning the prop of a turboprop into a first-stage compressor, improving efficiency and power by helping to precompress the core turbine's intake (increasing mass flow, reducing core temperatures and compression ratios) while eliminating the supersonic blade tip problem. This was the dual-spool turbojet, which quickly became evident could be made more efficient by sucking in even more air than needed and mixing it with the combustion products, after combustion, as ""bypass air"" (because it bypassed the combustor). This bypass air was still a source of thrust, and was more efficient by reducing the overall speed of exhaust and upping mass flow. (there's an optimal jet exhaust speed for a given airspeed and pressure, and exhaust speed is controlled by temperature vs. mass flow) This was the first low-bypass turbofan, which ushered in the real ""jet age"", since this was an engine efficient enough to stick on an airliner - there were turbojet airliners beforehand, but they were rapidly obsoleted or re-engined. Promptly lots of improvements and clones were developed by everyone who could get their hands on one to look at.   Technology continued to improve, and by the '60s engines had gotten to the point where they were pushing as much air through as bypass as they were putting through the core; exhaust speeds were back up as high as they were at the invention of the turbofan. A single, massive fan was added on the front, designed to pull even more air in, recognising that bypass air could be the main source of output power (just like on a turboprop). They were also much quieter because of lower exhaust velocities, and yet more fuel-efficient. This was the high-bypass turbofan and that's roughly where we are now; high-bypass turbofans are extremely efficient and have been getting quieter, but have the drawback that they take a relatively long time (ten seconds or so) to spool up and down, and most are very firmly subsonic only, which means there's still a place for low-bypass turbofans in some military jets. There's also some interest in propfans and similar, which are basically short-bladed turboprops with unducted turbine-like blades, but they're extremely noisy and thus not really on the cards for commercial aviation. The Russians have a transport aircraft that uses them, and they offer some gains over a turboprop or a HB turbofan for short-takeoff heavy aviation, but these aren't big commercial concerns.  TL;DR ""turboprop"" and ""turbojet"" are 1950s words for 1950s concepts; modern engines have nicked the best bits from each and so the names aren't so helpful. Almost everything is a turbofan now, and the rest are turboprops."

MachinePorn,2sdysf,chazysciota,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:01:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert on it, but my guess is the the somewhat cooler HB exhaust might bring on condensation more easily, and the higher quantities of air flowing through the engine and cooling/expanding will force an overall higher quantity of water out as condensate, creating more visible contrails.  On the other hand, it's worth remembering that the chemtrail conspiracy theory is subject to the usual social construction thing: the rise of the theory may just be due to the soaring number of flights after the invention of the HB turbofan made commercial aviation cheaper, taking those flights over more people who then saw more contrails.   Or of course the government really are spraying psychotropics on us all. Like all good conspiracy theories, if you doubt it, you're in on the conspiracy."

The main differences between a turboprop and a high-bypass turbofan are A: turbofan has a duct around the fan, whereas the turboprop has no duct but a larger, slower turning set of blades; and B: In order to turn those larger, slower blades a turboprop has to have a reduction gearing.  However, there are now some turbofans that have large enough fans that they require reduction gearing to turn them: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_PW1000G"
MachinePorn,2sdysf,Neurorational,2,Wed Jan 14 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"and generate prop wash over the wing    I have seen jet engines mounted to produce this effect, as well. I wonder why the idea (sorry) it never really took off."
MachinePorn,2sdysf,catsfive,11,Wed Jan 14 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"Jet exhausts are very hot[citation needed] so they don't play nicely with most wing surfaces; the benefit you'd get from a jet pointed over a wing would be offset by the fact that you'd have to armour the wing against a 600mph, 500°C jet blast. The Ekranoplan starter engines (which might be what you were thinking of) were only for takeoff, and rear views show that they have their exhaust directed down, where it's somewhat cooled and slowed by the sea.   The other problem is that wings do best when air is cool (and therefore dense), moving relatively slowly, over a wide area of them (300mph, rather than 600mph) and there's lots of it to go around; jets produce a narrower, faster moving jet of hotter, less dense air which doesn't generate as much lift for a given energy input because it's less dense, there's lots of interface turbulence as it mixes with other air over the wing, and there's just less of it. For comparison, look at jets designed to go into the transonic region and note how they fly on (delta) wings designed at least partly to create compression lift, rather than the straighter wings of slower aircraft which don't go transonic and generate their lift predominantly via the Bernoulli effect.  Some jets (notably the A-10 and some business jets) stick their engines above and behind the wing, for noise reasons and protection against ground fire, as well as to get the intakes raised higher above the ground and reduce the danger of runway debris ingestion. This doesn't really help with lift (in fact, the A-10 has special slats designed to keep feeding the engines air at higher angles of attack, because the wing can cause intake airflow to stall when the engine is in its' aerodynamic shadow) but it does have other benefits."

I would suggest that they ""Y"" in their name indicates they had some drawbacks compared to the C-130 (which was the aircraft it (or the YC-15) was slated to replace) but nonetheless, it looks like a very clever thing and particularly the Coanda effect flap/thrust diversion is a nice bit of engineering to solve the STOL problem.   The An-72 being successful as a passenger aircraft can maybe be chalked up to Russian flights of smaller numbers of people over longer distances, to less-improved but still established airstrips - using jets will have an advantage over flights longer than a few hundred kilometres because of higher cruise ceilings, and getting the engines up and away from FOD is a good move if you're flying to an airstrip that has a staff of three men and a dog to keep watch overnight, and might have all manner of junk on the runway."
MachinePorn,2sdysf,hexapodium,2,Thu Jan 15 14:08:38 2015 UTC,"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coandă_effect  Turns out it's not all that useful at high speeds, so you actually end up paying for the extra takeoff/landing lift with additional drag at altitude. Better use of the effect is via low-mounted engines working with trailing edge ""blown flaps"" that lower into the jet exhaust stream and direct it downwards to increase takeoff/landing lift. The C-17 uses this design."

JP-8 can also substitute for diesel if you add some lubricants, which is unbelievably useful for militaries because they then only have to run one supply chain for fuel.   The point is that a piston engined aircraft can only run on avgas, which is far more dangerous stuff to be around in general, more volatile, and can't be efficiently used for other things - in the case of military aircraft, the relevant thing is that you really don't want to have to have tankers which dispense more than one sort of fuel, or multiple kinds of tankers."

MachinePorn,2sdysf,BallsDeepInJesus,1 point,Thu Jan 15 07:54:35 2015 UTC,The amount of thrust produced by the turboprop thrust is almost nil. Thrust from the exhaust is a very inefficient use of energy.
MachinePorn,2sdysf,Katapesh_Express,2,Sat Jan 17 09:53:03 2015 UTC,"It is, however, not actually nil; depending on the engine it can be as much as 20% of effective power (because no turbine can extract 100% of power from a flowing fluid, for the obvious reason that the fluid has to keep moving). Some varied examples here. More importantly, it's effectively free power in exchange for which direction a pipe goes, so engine designers and users alike appreciate the free bump in performance from pointing the exhaust backwards not sideways.  As an object lesson, look at the PT6D: designed to be short and compact, the turbine itself is pointed backwards for easier prop mounting, but the exhaust flips 180° because it adds a few per cent to the ESHP figure."
MachinePorn,2sdysf,hexapodium,3,Sat Jan 17 11:03:53 2015 UTC,"Well, they are turboprop engines so there's a gas turbine engine producing no thrust instead powering a propeller.

An extra lane going into the city in the AM, and an extra lane leaving. No ""HOV ONLY"" bullshit. Half the reason there IS traffic is from all the HOV cockfuckers that get to the end of the HOV lane then cut across 4 lanes of traffic to make it to an exit!  Fucking christ."
MachinePorn,2s8fko,PotViking,6,Tue Jan 13 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"This is the HOV lane on the I-15 in San Diego.  The side going ""with"" traffic gets an extra lane."
MachinePorn,2s8fko,skucera,7,Tue Jan 13 03:46:58 2015 UTC,"That's how it is in Boston too, but the lane is divided either way, and only for HOV vehicles.  Because of this, at the end of the HOV lane (left-hand side) there's a ton of cars that exit the HOV then immediately have to cut across 4 lanes of traffic. Which is half the reason we have so much traffic.  If they did away with the separated lane, and just had it expand like this, it would help a LOT more than the current setup."
MachinePorn,2s8fko,PotViking,2,Tue Jan 13 03:56:26 2015 UTC,I think what /u/skucera is saying is that all the lanes you see in the gif are HOV only and they are separated from the normal traffic lanes.  This would not solve any issues with exiting the HOV lanes.  I prefer the HOV lanes that are just the left most lanes that still allow you to get back into the other lanes between every exit (or maybe every other one).  But the separate HOV exits are awesome (LA has a lot of this I think...HOV lanes aren't physically separated but still have dedicated exits).
MachinePorn,2s8fko,iswallowmagnets,2,Tue Jan 13 09:17:29 2015 UTC,"Nope,  one HOV lane,  they just switch the direction by moving the barrier."

Here's a great video of some douchebag laughing at them because they're stuck in the HOV lane because of an accident. You can see the setup.  Basically, during non-rush times (11am - 2pm and 7pm - 5am) there is a double barrier of these cement dividers in the middle of an 8-lane highway (4 lanes north, 4 south). During peak times, they open one half of the divider for an HOV lane.  During AM rush, the southbound side's leftmost lane is gated off to those going south, and given to those going north as an HOV lane. Because of the double cement barrier, that means that the HOV lane is closed off unless you're at the very beginning or very end.   There is no leaving early. Leaving early would mean driving through a cement barrier.  Here's more info on it.  It's a terrible design that creates more traffic instead of alleviating it."

MachinePorn,2s8fko,elint,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:13:16 2015 UTC,Why would pickup trucks need to direct traffic away from the lane?  doesn't the barrier do that sufficiently?
MachinePorn,2s8fko,thelukenator,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"The barrier is being moved, and thus is eliminating the lane we are speaking of. So I would think that cars should be directed away from that lane beforehand."
MachinePorn,2s8fko,hglman,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"No one can be in the lane being removed unless they are in front of the machine. Unless traffic is stopped or moving less than the speed of the machine they cant get consumed by the moving barrier. Oh and in that case, you know the barrier transfer machine could just stop.   Note how the two end of the machine are pointed towards the flow of traffic on each side. For the lane being removed, the front of the machine is ahead of the removed lane, the consumed lane begins in front of the machine. For the lane being added, the rear faces into the lane being added, where it is the first car now in that lane."

It also helps that no flight is more than 1-2 degrees off a major airline hub, anyway, so routing logistics are fairly straightforward.  As for other cargo, there is always a high supply of overnight/next day stuff going around. Obviously Fedex and UPS have their own fleets, but commercial airlines still offer courier options and I doubt most commercial flights go anywhere without at least some cargo."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,obsa,2,Mon Jan 12 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"Airplanes and engines are often backordered for many months to years, so they are constantly in high demand. Wherever it's going, it probably needs to be there soon.   I wouldn't say constantly. Perhaps when a new more efficient model comes out there's a backlog of orders, but after that plateaus, regular engine replacement could be anticipated well in advance. If factories can't keep up with demand, then it's time to build more factories because there's money to be made."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,wallyupdabungenstein,0,Mon Jan 12 02:10:44 2015 UTC,"My point was that there's no warehouse of engines just sitting around - new ones all built to order. The ecosystem is more stable for mature products, especially because used/refurbished options are on the table, but they're still not dime-a-dozen."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,obsa,2,Mon Jan 12 13:04:24 2015 UTC,"And my point was that they aren't constantly in high demand, or someone would build another factory and fill the void. Whilst they would have orders on the books, I don't think they're simply built to order. I think they anticipate demand. For example if an engine blew up unexpectedly, and someone desperately needed a replacement, I'm sure they'd have one in excess without having to push the dates back on everyone on their order books. You don't buy a car to order. I know there's more planes out there, but there are still a lot of planes, and less models and manufacturers.   And you don't order an engine, and then sit around waiting for it to be built. It's anticipated with sufficient time in advance.  I don't think this is the regular way of transporting engines. I think it's for unusual cases where it's needed on short notice. I'd say that they are built near to where they are needed for new planes, or the plane flies to where the engines are to get a replacement when the plane is being overhauled. Then it only has to be fitted to a plane once."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,wallyupdabungenstein,1 point,Mon Jan 12 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to continue to argue with your impressions.  However, this:   You don't buy a car to order.   is an especially ridiculous comparison. There is no contest between the supply chain logistics of 4-5 digit price tag commodities and 8-9 digit price tag commodities. And there are tons of cars, even at the average consumer price tier, which are built to order. And, surprise, cars that are more expensive? Back ordered for months or years."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,obsa,3,Mon Jan 12 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"Considering the price of a spare engine, I imagine that the airline needs to keep it available for use.  If they needed to account for engines to be completely unavailable for up to two months, just to transport it to their maintenance base, they would need to buy extra spare engines.  The shipping price is less than the marginal cost of additional spare engines."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,skucera,10,Mon Jan 12 20:13:54 2015 UTC,"I can't think of where to put this, so I'm putting it here: Many, many airlines do not own the engines they fly on their jets (nevermind that often, they don't even own the jets themselves). They're leased. For instance, I live in Canada where we have WestJet, and they have, say, 110 737 aircraft, meaning that they have 222 engines in total in the fleet. All the engines are leased from GE. Why 222 and not 220? They have two spares which they can have trucked anywhere they need them, on the spot. Not sure they can be flown anywhere, though."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,catsfive,0,Mon Jan 12 02:13:11 2015 UTC,"Why would Qantas want to pay someone else to ship an engine for them when the plane is going there anyway? The cost of shipping it on their own plane is almost zero.  Furthermore, the engine goes from maintenance hangar direct to maintenance hanger, and the maintenance crews would be the ones needing the engine, and they're the ones who would be detaching it."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,mecaenas,2,Mon Jan 12 03:50:48 2015 UTC,Guess what they do when they're using the freighter version? ;) But on a B744 like this there's no door big enough to fit one in.

Remember this was the biggest turbofan ever introduced at the time.  Today you're much less likely to see this as the airports they fly to are much more likely to have spares nearby or can be flown in via a freighter.

MachinePorn,2s3onn,spoonified,14,Sun Jan 11 22:48:15 2015 UTC,Yup. It's there to provide the capability to ferry a spare engine to a stranded plane. Back when it first flew there really was no other way to get an engine to a plane in need as the infrastructure just did not support moving something that big at short notice.  IIRC the A380 engines have as a requirement the ability to be shipped in a B744F so they don't need such a setup.
MachinePorn,2s3onn,zaphodharkonnen,5,Sun Jan 11 22:56:46 2015 UTC,"Back when it first flew there really was no other way to get an engine to a plane in need as the infrastructure just did not support moving something that big at short notice.   The 747 was designed with the cargo variant in mind from the start (the ""hump"" is actually there to get the cockpit out of the way for front-loading), since it was assumed that passenger 747s would be converted to cargo as supersonic aircraft took over passenger services. Would they not have assumed that infrastructure for moving large objects would exist once the 747 was adopted, or does an engine not fit in a cargo 747 via the front door?"
MachinePorn,2s3onn,BCMM,3,Mon Jan 12 03:49:35 2015 UTC,The 747-400E has a side cargo door that can easily fit an engine. You have to do a bit of move and turning but it is possible. as far as the front door goes it can fit and engine but I think a 747 engine is too tall. nose load/unloading is usually reserved for long short pallets that are too long to get in the side door.   Source: I am a GSE mechanic for a company that mainly loads/unloads cargo aircraft such as a 747-400.
MachinePorn,2s3onn,gingi_chipmunk,2,Mon Jan 12 08:44:22 2015 UTC,"Well once enough had been built the infrastructure would exist. But until then you'd still need a way of moving engines around. I don't think many thought widebody planes would become as amazingly successful as they have.  Also the passenger 747s would need some serious modifications to add the nose door as it only comes standard on the freighter version.  And sure it fits through the front door. Hell, these days it probably fits through the side door of the big widebody freighters. ;)"

MachinePorn,2s3onn,mynameisalso,3,Mon Jan 12 05:17:52 2015 UTC,All 747s have this capability. This is very much a revenue flight and probably where ever it's going has a plane stranded. It's not that common now a days but you can still see 5th engines every once in a while.
MachinePorn,2s3onn,flagsfly,3,Mon Jan 12 07:25:15 2015 UTC,"This was a capability built into the 747 from the beginning.  In 1969 there was simply no other way to quickly get one of these large engines to a grounded airplane.  All of the early airplanes had the mounts, though by the time of the 747-400 it was an option.  None of the purpose built freighters do, since they can take them on the main deck.    However it rare these days, since you can almost always use a 747 or 777 freighter."

My uneducated guess would have been that the engines of the left wing failed and had to be replaced and a ""make do"" with smaller engines was done so the plane could go home. The last engine was then added as failsafe/decoration/ballast/the new guy forgot it there.  Your explanation is more likely though. Although I don't see how this would be the best way to carry an engine. It seems like a lot more trouble than needed."

MachinePorn,2s3onn,Kaheil2,1 point,Mon Jan 12 03:35:12 2015 UTC,"Can you tell me a better way?  This method ensures the airline is in control of their property the entire time so if damages occur, they'll most likely know about it. Also, the only costs is in fuel (which they buy in bulk orders, securing prices that aren't affected by the week to week swings in the futures market).   Shipping any other way entails packaging the engine securely to a custom cradle, purchasing additional insurance to cover possible transit damage not to mention the added transit time."

MachinePorn,2s3onn,Nathineil,3,Mon Jan 12 23:24:17 2015 UTC,"Let me preface by saying this is pure speculation, as I have no experience in the field, but I'd imagine it's due to a number of reasons.  Off the top of my head, I'm thinking:   The throttles for each engine can be controlled independently, so you can just throttle back the larger turbofan proportionally to produce the same thrust as the others. Cost. As it's a test engine, producing two and finding there's a flaw in the design might be an expense they don't want to risk Safety. I know for a fact a 747 can fly on 3 engines if the test one were to malfunction. Perhaps they don't want to risk going to 2?   Again, pure speculation and could be 100% wrong, but I think at least the first point is a reasonable assumption."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,Audict,2,Mon Jan 12 05:44:05 2015 UTC,"Fair points. I had considered the second two. My question was more around the first point. I would've thought if you want to test and engine, you would want to push it to see what it can handle. I suppose though that you can also scale back the standard engine on the same side to produce equal thrust.."
MachinePorn,2s3onn,Nathineil,3,Mon Jan 12 06:58:38 2015 UTC,You don't need equal thrust on both wings to prevent the plane from 'flying in circles'.  You can compensate for unbalanced thrust by trimming the rudder.
MachinePorn,2s3onn,tylerdoubleyou,1 point,Mon Jan 12 08:32:01 2015 UTC,But that would be inefficient.  I suppose I would like to know exactly what they are testing and how with a new engine set up like this
MachinePorn,2s3onn,Nathineil,5,Mon Jan 12 08:54:17 2015 UTC,"Inefficiency doesn't matter for a test like this.  Also, note that it's the inner engine, so it'll produce less yaw than the outer engines.

MachinePorn,2s3onn,flagsfly,1 point,Tue Jan 13 08:28:07 2015 UTC,Not as inefficient as you might think. The drag from the (slightly) deflected rudder would likely incur negligible cost compared to the entire flight testing program as a whole.
MachinePorn,2s3onn,Avilator,9,Mon Jan 12 12:29:23 2015 UTC,"if the 747 can economically handle the weight and drag of an extra engine, would it be feasible to design an extra cargo fairing in the same place? or would the ground crew labor required for this be too scarce/specialized?"
MachinePorn,2s3onn,doughcastle01,26,Mon Jan 12 20:21:52 2015 UTC,Carrying cargo internally is always more efficient. The fuel cost due to drag from carrying an engine like this is simply less than the cost of hiring a cargo plane to haul a spare engine somewhere where they already have a short-hop passenger flight going.
MachinePorn,2s3onn,Dug_Fin,7,Mon Jan 12 00:11:22 2015 UTC,"5th engine flights have some pretty significant performance penalties.   So much so that it is rarely done, instead the engines go on the main deck of 747 or 777 freighters."

MachinePorn,2s3onn,iheartrms,4,Mon Jan 12 01:03:17 2015 UTC,"Just speculating but since it's not a functional engine, they probably didn't have to do all the air worthiness tests in this configuration, engine is already obviously rated to fly on this frame, have to do the math that shows the wing can take the max rated load with the extra weight, but after that I imagine most of it is just rubber stamped or you work in the worst possible configuration (extra engine) and then sign off on having 1 less there."

I live a couple of blocks away from the Ghent Belfry  The belfry used to house the Klokke Roeland, a massive clock made in the 14th century. It was destroyed in the 16th century and from the remains a new carillion was cast. The biggest clock of the carrilion was called ""De Grote Triomphante"", but it is mostly referred to as the second Klokke Roeland. This one broke in the 20th century and another replacement was made. Alot of stuff happened that i'm not going to write down but in the end a total of FOUR stormbells were made for the belfry. Three of wich still exist, and one in use.  Every 15 minutes the carillion will play 'Klokke Roeland', here's an audio fragment of the song being played.  more links:  De Grote Triomphante, the second Klokke Roeland, being rung in its resting place.  The third and current Klokke Roeland in action at the start of the gentse feesten"

The machine was equipped with large tractor wheels, 8 feet in diameter, and carried girders on an endless chain which were lowered above a trench so that the back wheels could roll over it. The machine would then drag the girder behind until on flat terrain, so that it could reverse over them and set them back in place in front of the vehicle. The machine proved much too cumbersome and was abandoned.   The article also has a bunch of pictures of other really cool old tanks.  The article has links for this machine but they go to another article about early tanks that never mentions it once."

MachinePorn,2rneoa,fleapepper,3,Thu Jan 8 02:57:14 2015 UTC,Engineering limitations.  You can't fit 2x 1200hp diesel engines in that chassis. It would also be going a shitload faster if it had 2400hp on tap.  11.6 litre diesel engines without boost produce ~812Nm each (1600Nm together).  To get the claimed 3500ft-lb (4800Nm) requires a density increase of 3x.  Which you can do with compound turbocharging using parts available in the late 80's. The 6x density increase that would be required to generate 7000 ft-lbs of torque is far beyond the capabilities of 1988 and would be extremely difficult now.  edit  Some more details.  The 2x1200hp and 2x3500ft-lbs is a journo making a mistake.  3500ft-lbs and 1200hp fit well with the hardware limitations of the time.

MachinePorn,2rneoa,ctesibius,7,Thu Jan 8 11:35:24 2015 UTC,Apparently this truck has 6000hp.  I consciously choose to believe.
MachinePorn,2rneoa,An0k,9,Wed Jan 7 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"I can only tell you that if they weren't limited to 150km/hour, they would have been the fastest type of Dakar vehicle around. Before the limitations (implemented by the organisation, because of safety), those trucks reached brutal speeds (200km +). They were much faster then the cars and motors."
MachinePorn,2rneoa,meuzobuga,3,Wed Jan 7 20:03:06 2015 UTC,But the bikes are limited to 450cc these days. I can't see them being slower than 200km/h without that limit.
MachinePorn,2rneoa,Jerrrel,2,Wed Jan 7 22:05:19 2015 UTC,Even the crazy guy who race them are probably sane enough to not go 200km/h on dirt tracks.

MachinePorn,2rneoa,vwstig,3,Wed Jan 7 22:40:40 2015 UTC,That's very similar to how large piston-engined airliners were set up. Pilot/Copilot/Flight Engineer. Makes sense given the similar need for endurance.   On Pan Am's flying boats there were actually tunnels in the wings so that the flight engineer could work on the engines in flight.
MachinePorn,2rneoa,Qassini,2,Wed Jan 7 23:36:50 2015 UTC,Also early jet airliners had 3 men in the cockpit.

MachinePorn,2rneoa,TeamEdge,1 point,Sat Jan 17 07:56:32 2015 UTC,Lower
MachinePorn,2rneoa,Cubejam,3,Thu Jan 8 05:57:55 2015 UTC,"The rear fuel tank is just above & in front of the rear axle.  Seems pretty good to me, given its likely very heavy when full.  Mounting it lower would intrude on drivetrain, suspension, etc, and also risk it getting hit by rocks.  Could be they have even denser stuff than fuel down low; batteries, tools, spare parts."

MachinePorn,2rixpw,MeEvilBob,2,Wed Jan 7 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"Those machines are real loud when they're not covered in decorative armour which probably rattles and adds even more noise.  I can imagine somebody running that with some death metal blasting out of those speakers.  I've done that in a 1974 Tucker Sno-Cat while hauling snowmaking equipment around a ski resort without all the armor, but that doesn't seem quite as cool, although it was freezing cold.    edit:  If anybody's looking at the cab shot (#4) and wondering, 8 speed (high/low).  The levers between the seats are for attachments (like a detachable snow groomer or a winch, etc.) with the parking brake lever in front of them.  It's power steering, but with the tracks there's so much resistance that you can't turn the wheel at all unless you're moving. Even then you can't just steer like in a car, it forces you to turn the wheel slowly because the tracks need to advance in that direction, they can't just turn on a dime like tires.  It's also awkward in that both the front and back track assemblies pivot (the front or back tracks are always directly parallel to each other) and the back tracks rotate the opposite direction as the front ones so the whole vehicle kind of curves into the turns rather than the back following the front like in a car.  It really is a fun machine to drive and it can go pretty fast, although I never trusted the one I ran any faster than high-2."

MachinePorn,2rixpw,Remote_Start,2,Tue Jan 6 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"If it's real plating, then my guess is it weighs too much for that machine to even be able to move.  They were designed for pulling torque, not weight capacity.  Source:  A place I used to work had a 1974 Tucker Sno-Cat which still runs great, I've run that machine many times and have always enjoyed it.  Unlike most tracked machines which use a skid steer system, this machine actually pivots the front tracks to steer.  Inside the cab it's just like any other old truck.  The machine is great for what it's designed for, but the ride is anything but smooth even on soft snow."

MachinePorn,2reu1x,PanGalacGargleBlastr,12,Mon Jan 5 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"Ever look at dazzle camouflage and wonder ""How the hell does that work?""  To compute an accurate firing solution for a torpedo from a sub you have to know: heading, speed, course and distance to the target for both your vessel and the target vessel. Sounds simple enough until you factor in doing so through a very small submerged window for a very small period of time, or over distances of thousands of yards at night or in bad weather. All it takes is a small mis-judgement in aspect ratio by a few degrees or under or over-estimating the speed of the target to screw the solution completely up - even to the point that firing multiple torpedoes in spread might not even do the trick. The greater the distance, the greater the chances that the solution might not work. That's what dazzle is supposed to do - make it more difficult to determine accurate orientation/distance thus compromising the firing solution.  Couple that, with the fact that the US Navy's pre-WWII testing of their latest model of torpedo consisted of firing two of them at a seaside cliff - with only one of them detonating (that 50% rate with an N = 2 was considered a ""success"") that plagued US Sub Skippers for at least the first year and a half of the war. I'm amazed those guys could hit anything at all. And if they did hit anything, often nothing would happen because the detonator wouldn't go off."

That's usually the staff review bin. Overdue/Late, Unable to read the rfid, No RFID, programmed exception (Ie if a DVD was more then one disk at my library, it went to the bin. Think TV Series as a example). A single dvd, book, etc would get taken off your account record. So if you checked out a DVD Copy of friends, stole all but one disk (or removed the rfid tag and stuck it inside the case) you would get away with free disks. Hence the exception.  Crafty thieves for new releases would remove the rfid ""donut"" (around the spindle hole) slap it on a crap/bad/dud disk) and keep the new copy until the library changed the security method of letting those get checked out."

I could unload the bins onto rolling shelves. Patrons ran the outside feeders. As a volunteer, I couldn't run the machine, only panic stopping it and helping the (always frequent) jam ups.  For whatever reason also, it would go haywire and sort into the wrong bin. It was ""programmed"" to dump into a bin at the far end (manual staff review) in case of a general failure, but it would either go nuts and dump anywhere (terminator 2 in the kids section anyone?) panic and dump into the outgoing courier bin or anywhere else it felt.  Also for whatever reason, It would come in from the outside feed port (the first one) and just start dumping it always into a trash can nearby. No reason. Still couldn't figure that one out. Sometimes it would get a book jammed and do it, other times it just kinda reversed direction and started flinging into a trash can?  Odd machine. They always called it Cerberus where I worked, since it was 3 headed. Staff Head inside and two on the left side of it"

But instead of having two librarians (or clerks, whatever you call them) they might only need one.  I'm not sure what this machine does, but the one at my uni scans the barcodes and then sorts the books into what area of the library they are in. This would massively reduce the time needed to return books to their proper location. It also means when you return book it happens instantly."

Did you have special access?  The foot is cut off (didn't expect to say that about a non-human subject) by the bottom of the frame. It's not the same as a human subject, so this is a bit of a nitpick. Compositionally the curve of the conveyor belt is good.  I would have liked to see more of the machine in focus. It's actually quite difficult to figure out where your plane of focus is. Shooting perpendicular to the machine so that most of the interesting stuff is in the same plane of focus would be easier.  Closeups of parts would help this as a series.  Final nitpicks, though there is not much you could have done at the time of exposure: half inclusion of the car and person's feet.

MachinePorn,2qz1s8,ksheep,1 point,Thu Jan 1 03:22:08 2015 UTC,I have a tiny spot of rust on my car which is nearly impossible to sand.  Would a consumer grade laser work like this?
MachinePorn,2qz1s8,ZarK-eh,2,Thu Jan 1 04:17:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is a consumer-grade laser. Looking at similar lasers (specifically, one being used to strip paint off a car), the laser is likely ~1000W, which is quite a bit more powerful than consumer-grade machines, and the device is the size of a chest of drawers (with a hand-held ""gun"" that emits the laser). This would likely cost somewhere in the thousands of dollars range.  After a bit of digging, I found a company that makes these lasers, which ""removes contaminants, production residue and coatings without damaging the substrate"". Their lasers range from a 20-watt model that is the size of a backpack, useful for ""small area treatments and for gently cleaning historic surfaces"", to 1000-watt models the size of trolley carts. Unfortunately, the site doesn't state prices for any of these, but they appear to be geared towards industrial usage. They're unlikely to be at a reasonable price for occasional consumer use."

Without pixel peeping, it appears to me that the components are aligned with the appropriate removal axes, at least for the vertical.  I do like the subtle perspective by changing the relative angle of the components to the camera, giving the illusion of the components being suspended in space. This does break with the standards of an exploded view being in the same perspective, but this is an acceptable artistic departure.  Definitely looking forward to seeing more of this type of work.

In addition, most of the suspension system was ripped out to save on weight, and the trucks only have 2 wheels apiece. For a company that made buses, this seemed fine, but it added to the train's lack of stability.  So it looks great, but rides awful."

MachinePorn,2qu5u5,LordBrandon,4,Wed Dec 31 10:40:17 2014 UTC,There's no axial thrust on straight cut gears.
MachinePorn,2qu5u5,thegoldenmandenis,3,Wed Dec 31 10:47:54 2014 UTC,that's correct. But you don't get smooth operation with straight cut gears.  You get smooth operation with angled cut geares but it results in axial thrust.  herring bone geares are the best of both worlds (besides the higher costs of manufacturing).

Prototype I (build from steel)  Engine: 41 hp Speed land: 40 km/h water: 7 km/h Weight: 1550 kg load: 200 kg Skid steering like a tracked vehicle (braked-differential)  Prototype II (build from aluminium)  Engine: 53 hp Speed land: 60 km/h water: 10 km/h Weight: 1300 kg load: 515 kg Skid steering like a tracked vehicle (clutch-brake)  The driver can select minor or major wheel rotation.  It could climb stairs but it performed better in mud than on rocks. In the mud the whole star with the 3 wheels rotates. On a ""flat"" track it runs on the 8 lower wheels without the star rotation."

MachinePorn,2qms38,Leav,28,Mon Dec 29 04:00:47 2014 UTC,"For longer distance transits, it's cheaper and quicker to piggy-back vessels like these.  Normally, self propelled semi-subs have a transit speed of 5-8 knots while a heavy lift ship can make 14-18 knots. The pontoon design of these vessels is directed more towards stability rather than speed, so the heavy lift ship will be quicker while also burning less fuel per day.  I cannot see any thrusters on the rig in the picture so I'm going to assume they have either been removed for the passage or maintenance or they maybe have the ability to be retracted. I have seen this feature on oil rig supply boats but never on a semi-sub.  I also see that it has an 8-point mooring system. I don't know if this will be used when the vessel is operational though. Some semi subs stay in position using thrusters alone, some use a combination of both thrusters and anchors (TAMS: Thruster Assisted Mooring System) and some rely solely on anchors.

MachinePorn,2qck0t,liotier,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:18:19 2015 UTC,Actually these machines deal just fine with slippage or bending or otherwise unexpected mechanical problems because they verify tool and material location with cameras and lasers in real time. Constantly modeling the real object and tool and making sure it matches the end product design.
MachinePorn,2qck0t,Dosinu,2,Tue Apr 14 13:20:36 2015 UTC,That is pretty sick.  Thanks man!
MachinePorn,2qck0t,machine_monkey,2,Thu Dec 25 18:32:14 2014 UTC,is this hard to program? or is there software that can format a 3d model for the machine to mill?

MachinePorn,2qck0t,machine_monkey,4,Thu Dec 25 09:06:38 2014 UTC,is this hard to program? or is there software that can format a 3d model for the machine to mill?   Designing an optimal path including tool changes is just as difficult as designing the piece itself.
MachinePorn,2qck0t,FoodBeerBikesMusic,2,Thu Dec 25 11:39:49 2014 UTC,"i thought there would be programs to lay it all out for the machine automatically.  This is a shoddy example, but like, there are programs that convert a jpeg into ascii characters, once you have all the dimensions and functions of the machine figured out, couldn't u just give it a 3d model from cad or w/e and let the machine convert it for you?"
MachinePorn,2qck0t,machine_monkey,9,Thu Dec 25 12:09:12 2014 UTC,"Sort of. The software will do a decent amount of the work for you, but needs human refinement to work optimally. I work in a machine shop, and I've seen the programmers doing their thing but haven't done much of any myself so i can't give a more detailed response. Programming something like that helmet manually would be comically difficult if not impossible."

Typical process: you have a 3D solid model - either you created or got from a customer. Typically, you pick the surfaces you want to machine, the ones you don't want to run into, the type of cut, the tool and all the parameters. Then you verify the tool paths onscreen in a variety of view styles. Once you're satisfied, you postprocess the tool paths to generate the code for whatever machine you're using, send it to the machine. Set up your material and your cutters, and push the button and hope like hell you didn't miss something."

One of our young engineers got to experience that the other day when he came in to look at his die that I was machining. I had already started the program once and stopped it to make a some minor adjustment, so I knew everything would clear, my offset was good etc. Whenhe came over to look, I just pushed the button and restarted the program from the beginning. He visibly jumped and said ""ahhh"" when the table took off and the spindle rapid-ed down toward the surface.... He said ""Is it always that scary?"" I just looked at him and said ""Meh.

Unemployment office.....?"" If you're lucky it just chokes on some bad code. (One I sometimes run into is if I've forgotten to switch post processors. The machine goes to read the program, looks at the prep codes and says ""WTF?"" and just stops.) You can wreck a cutter, wreck the part, wreck the machine.... No matter how much onscreen verification you do, there's still a pucker moment when you push the button....  The machines are incredibly stupid. If you tell it to shove a cutter 1/2"" into the table, it will try to do it. I've broken more than a few cutters and had to scrap or repair a number of parts, but never wadded the machine itself. You develop a series of steps you go through to minimize the bad shit. For instance, before I close the door, I give the part on the table one good yank - I'd rather find out I forgot to clamp it down that way, than the hard way.... When starting a new program, I set rapid travel to 5% and make sure it's starting in the right place (and that I haven't forgotten to set my part offset correctly). The first move down toward the part, my hand is on the stop button and I've gotten pretty good at hitting it when the cutter is just above the part - there's a ""distance to go' display on the Haas. If it says I have 1"" to go, and the cutter is only 1/4"" above the part, I know I've forgotten to set my tool length offset. You can also use ""block mode"" which requires you to hit the button for every line of code and step slowly throigh the program.  Once it's running, though, if it decides to fuck up, there isn't jack you can do. Be shit happens in the blink of an eye."
MachinePorn,2qck0t,Dosinu,1 point,Fri Dec 26 11:08:35 2014 UTC,"Adding to the causes of error - if the machine cannot load the whole program to start and you have to feed it over a wired/wireless connection, if it drops a line of code it will just do the next line even if it means ripping the cutter and chuck through the part."

Some of those have absolutely phenomenal amounts of pressure behind them."
MachinePorn,2q86dy,uberbob102000,1 point,Thu Dec 25 17:27:06 2014 UTC,"Yeah, in the alpine part of Austria there are a lot of dual reservoir power stations around with one reservoir up in the mountains and one down in the valley together with the power house. Because quit low amounts of rainwater the reservoirs only fill up slowly (on some of the bigger ones its about 3 years from 0 to full). So there is not much water to be played with, but that's not the point.   These plants normally have about a 2:1 power consumption to power production ratio. About 20 years ago, cheap nuclear power would be used to pump water up during the night, which would then, during peak times be used to produce peak power with very high profit margins. All that peak capacity was not for Austria itself, but mainly for Germany, as they don't have suitable terrain for such installations and other forms of peak power production (gas) are often quit slow to respond.    However the whole pump at night and power at peak concept changed due to renewable energies like solar and wind power becoming a bigger thing in Germany.  While the idea of solar and wind is great, for electrical providers it is a nightmare, or at least for the German electrical providers it is. Due to high governmental funding hundred thousands of German homes have Solar panels installed, all directly connected to the grid, without any means for the power provider to switch them off when having too much power*. This means that the power providers have to get rid off that power somehow. (It is a bit easier with wind power plants as you can normally pay the owners of those to stop theirs temporarily instead of heaving them operate).   Now to get that power away, the Austrian power plants come into play. However, to call them Austrian power plants might be a bit misleading. While those plants are geographically in Austria,  they often do belong to the German providers. They often pay enormous amounts of money to own such a pump storage power plant for a couple of years (for example Kops II, the largest pump storage power plant in the world. Costed 250 million USD and belongs to the current operator that built it, for 10 years. After that it will fall into the hands of a local Austrian power provider, which didn't pay anything for that plant and will get a lot of profit with it. Not enough though power storage capability though, the next power plant on the cost of a German provider is already under construction. Same ownership transition will apply of course...).   While the Austrian providers normally advertise the plants as theirs (there is not the tiniest bit of labelling on that plant of who actually is the current owner), they don't even get to control most of them. Everything is done remotely from Germany.   But that's just the thing with renewable energies. This is one of the reasons why many power providers try to slow down construction of renewable energy sources. Not (only) because they make less profit, but because it has become a major technical difficulty to control the network. This is just due to the transition from central power production to decentralized power production.   There is currently only one solution that will work out. In a couple of years the first homes will get special devices which will regulate the power use of your home to suit the demands of the network. This means that you fill up your dishwasher/washing machine/central heating, but only when it suits the network, the power provider will actually start it. The broad amount of people doesn't know that, so politics don't care and just opt for as much green energy as possible. And soon enough, we will live with the consequences.   Don't get me wrong though, I am pro renewable energies, but as a technician knowing about what will come, I still hope we can find better solutions to the emission and waste free energy production concept.   (*Too much power might sound strange, but it is quit important thing that just the right amount of power is produced. If you produce to much power, the power frequency will raise. Just a marginal raise off that frequency will result in a lot of fault detection circuits of power plants too start emergency shut-offs. This on the other hand may result in power lines getting overloaded, more fail detection circuits switching off and finally it will lead into a blackout.   Similar events (Europe wide blackouts) nearly happened a few times in the past and could only be avoided due to quick reaction off the operators and some luck. In all cases the power outages where only of a few hours at most, whereas a complete blackout would have been a major problem.)"

MachinePorn,2q5bmn,ckfinite,2,Tue Dec 23 18:59:48 2014 UTC,"The fundamental problem is that any modern fighter at all, even ""cheap"" ones, are really bloody expensive. Gripen NG, the cheapest of the lot (and that low price comes with low payload), costs $60 million. F-35 comes next (!!!) with a projected FRP ($140 is from the prototype model you're seeing here, current cost in LRIP 8 is about $110 mil) aircraft cost of $80-90 million, followed by Rafale C, costing $106 million. Eurofighter comes last at about $120 million (90 million GBP).

MachinePorn,2pydrc,voucher420,3,Sun Dec 21 06:37:59 2014 UTC,What is the advantage to having this many valves?
MachinePorn,2pydrc,HAL-42b,10,Sun Dec 21 07:09:52 2014 UTC,More area for the gases to enter and exit.
MachinePorn,2pydrc,voucher420,-21,Sun Dec 21 08:31:56 2014 UTC,They can just do that with a larger valve.
MachinePorn,2pydrc,splenetic,89,Sun Dec 21 08:38:30 2014 UTC,"Remember that these are poppet valves, not (say) butterfly valves whose effective area is pretty much pi r squared. A poppet valve's effective area is measured by its circumference multiplied by its lift. You get more usable circumference by having three small valves than one big one. Also, as the valves are angled relative to the cylinder bore you can get more lift with small valves than bigger ones too.  Finally, small valves have less inertia than big ones which allows higher engine speeds before valve float becomes a problem."
MachinePorn,2pydrc,C0R4x,12,Sun Dec 21 09:24:52 2014 UTC,Awesome reply.  I hope to one day understand the math involved.

MachinePorn,2pydrc,lefthandedspatula,3,Sun Dec 21 15:49:36 2014 UTC,It's my understanding that with more valves there is more mass and friction involved.  How did Yamaha realize 3 valve fuel delivery outweighed the valve train stresses associated with it?  I'd like to learn how inertia in these applications is calculated and compared.
MachinePorn,2pydrc,skatetokil,2,Sun Dec 21 17:17:46 2014 UTC,"Inertia with valves is like wheels and tyres, the lighter the better. Mass difference between big and small valves is marginal; 3 small valves and 2 big ones aren't far apart, but more small ones will have less inertia.  The big consideration for more valves is cost. In every other respect the benefits of more valves win out."
MachinePorn,2pydrc,meuzobuga,3,Sun Dec 21 18:22:16 2014 UTC,Flow rate depends on circumference instead of area with these valves. You get more total circumference by having lots of smaller circles than just increasing the area of one.
MachinePorn,2pydrc,voucher420,3,Sun Dec 21 16:33:18 2014 UTC,"There is also a valve reliability issue with fewer larger valves.  Look at the crf250 which has similar performance numbers.  Since its launch it has had serious valve deformation issues in its 4 valve head - erosion of the titanium intake valves at the seat interface and ""tulip"" stretching where the repeated impact of the wide valves against the head cause the stem at the center to pull up toward the cams, eventually leading to a loss of valve clearance and catastrophic overheating of the head or low compression."

MachinePorn,2pydrc,carpespasm,12,Sun Dec 21 11:30:18 2014 UTC,"In a multi-cylinder engine that may be true. In a single cylinder, high performance engine like this one, it's a very good design since it lets the cylinder retain a higher volumetric efficiency by flowing more air in a shorter amount of time. Also you can use smaller valves, lighter springs, shorter duration cam, and less lift to achieve the same or better flow characteristics versus 2 or even just one massive valve. Valve float is hardly a concern at 13,500 rpm.   Yamaha is a pioneer in this technology. They have made engines with 6 and 7 valves in the past. The 5 valve design still lives in some of their onroad motorcycles, personal watercraft, and snowmobiles."

MachinePorn,2pydrc,albrano,3,Sun Dec 21 17:02:38 2014 UTC,"If your bike has over 100 hours I would HIGHLY suggest you get the head checked out. Yamaha heads are extremely reliable, but it's better to be safe than sorry.   This one had about 120 hours before the rebuild, the middle intake was shimmed out, and the other valves weren't far behind. The valves looked horrific. The shop that did the work told me they were some of the worst they had ever seen! The previous owner of the bike didn't pay attention to his dirty air filter, so $80 a piece valves were destroyed as a result.   I had FastHeads out in Utah do all the work. New Del West valves, Yamaha springs, new guides, Viton guide seals, and seats cut was $859. It was expensive, but their work is unbelievable. I'll definitely use them in the future if need be."
MachinePorn,2pydrc,NexusEvo,2,Sun Dec 21 18:50:41 2014 UTC,You paid almost $900 for a single head rebuild and they couldn't even properly surface the deck? They just scrubbed it a few times on a piece of sandpaper and left the impression of the old gasket in place...that is not good quality work.
MachinePorn,2pydrc,NexusEvo,1 point,Mon Dec 22 00:34:41 2014 UTC,"You really can't deck one of these heads. They are much too thin. There is also not enough valve relief cut into the piston(12.7 comp ratio) If the head is warped at all you have to buy a new one from Yamaha for $750, and they come unassembled without valves, springs, and guide seals. Easily another $600 in parts.   You should have seen what it looked like before. It was a disaster. I'm not worried about a little HG material left over."

MachinePorn,2pydrc,nawitus,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"100 hours for a lightly ridden race bike is about average. 150 is not uncommon but I personally wouldn't go that long. If you race and are very hard on the bike, 50 hours would be pushing it.   Utility ATV's and trail bikes don't make the shear amount of power(per CC of displacement), don't rev as high, and aren't built to the tight tolerances of one of these racing engines. They use steel valves, more restrictive air filters, are simply aren't stressing internal components to the limit everything time they are ridden. Honestly, these engines are about to as close to NASCAR or Formula 1 as the average person can get."

The fisker karma is an exception, where the gasoline engine only drives a generator. This is less efficient than just driving the wheels directly in a car sized application, but it's done in giant trucks and railway locomotives because a gear transmission for that application would be a bit terrible. It sounds like they may have lifted the powertrain directly from a locomotive, essentially. Nearly everything you see on the rails today has a V16 diesel driving a generator with a big electric motor on each axle."

MachinePorn,2pxd29,Hansafan,3,Sun Dec 21 14:57:00 2014 UTC,"Honda has favored a system that assists the gas engine, much like a turbo. It's essentially one powertrain where both run and are inseparable. The original Insight required downshifting a manual to get regenerative charging from the brakes.   Toyota uses a system that can run either or. The electric can take the car up to 35 mph (the average speed for the EPA's city MPG test) and then it can use a combination of gas and electric or just gas. The drawback is that the engine will kick in if the batteries are low even at startup (aka a generator).  The Volt cannot drive the wheels via the gas engine. It's an electric car with an onboard generator."

There were also necessary steam-driven pump units and boilers for steam generation installed. The first reconstruction of the plant took place in the years 1927-1929, when the engine house (new pumps and compressors were installed there) and a boiler room were remodelled. A workshop, a bath, a warehouse, garages, a fire brigade building and a chimney were constructed there as well.

Although Karchowice is not located in the industrial centre of Upper Silesia, at the end of the 19th c. the search for hard coal was started there.

As a result, over 125 years ago, a drinking water intake for the Upper Silesian agglomeration was established in Karchowice. From the oldest period the office building has been preserved, where at present a part of historic documents and photographs is exhibited within the Historical Water Supply Station “Zawada”.

MachinePorn,2puyfk,P-01S,35,Sat Dec 20 21:33:04 2014 UTC,"737 pilot here. Perhaps some folks would like an idea of how pilots interact with these.  There's a panel on the top of the overhead panel with two switches which turn on/off the dual INS units.  After the aircraft is powered up for the first flight of the day, we turn on these switches during our preflight flow, and then since we have rather primitive versions (they still work just fine, but this next step is pretty telling of the age of the system) we have to tell them where they are.  This is done by either selecting the GPS position reference (or by using gate position coordinates, if you work for a back-asswards airline which encourages pilot error magnification through paranoia about technology).  Once the IRS units are spooled up and aligned, they will auto-update their position throughout the flight by referencing the GPS.  In between flights we have to realign the IRS to eliminate the cumulative error.  This is done by turning the same overhead switches to ""ALIGN"" and then reinserting the GPS/gate position.  Again, this step has been eliminated on every airplane launched after about the year 2000.  And yes, the government occasionally do tests in which they turn off (or scramble, I don't know which) the GPS signal and it's unavailable for navigation for :15 to :30 minutes or so.  The IRS functions very adequately without the GPS backup, and ""drift"" is minimal enough to maintain RNP (Required Navigational Performance) for an hour or so without any external reference.  If we can't maintain RNP, we can always fall back to the rapidly obsolescent VOR airway system, and notify air traffic control.  The flight remains safe and legal."
MachinePorn,2puyfk,P-01S,3,Sat Dec 20 14:58:37 2014 UTC,Whats the procedure if the INS and GPS fails? Dead reckoning? VOR navigation?
MachinePorn,2puyfk,PilotKnob,7,Sat Dec 20 17:03:52 2014 UTC,"INS is dead reckoning.  I am not a pilot, but I assume they use VOR navigation."
MachinePorn,2puyfk,fresh_like_Oprah,1 point,Sat Dec 20 19:42:28 2014 UTC,"It is still a method of dead reckoning. The idea behind inertial navigation is that you keep it set as up to date as possible using external information (e.g. a GPS). If the external source of information is lost, the inertial system is used to calculate the craft's approximate location etc. until a new fix is established."
MachinePorn,2puyfk,TheScriptKiddie,1 point,Sat Dec 20 20:33:43 2014 UTC,"Essentially if they both fail we revert to the VOR airways and non-RNP approaches.  It's really not that big of a deal at this point.  But, when they decommission the VOR system, there will have to be another system in place as a backup.  It very well may be a part of the next-gen ATC system called ADS-B which is just starting to trickle down to the airlines at the present time."

Are you sure these forecast scheduled outages aren't just some prediction of high sunspot activity or some other recurring phenomenon that would occasionally reduce the GPS signal strength?"

But with absolute certainty I can say that ATC (at least occasionally) has advance knowledge of planned testing outages. Perhaps it's positional/altitude selective jamming. There are forecast outages as I said earlier, and outside of that I have no specifics. These testing periods will become a much bigger issue in the future with autodrive coming online. FWIW, the outage I experienced was in the middle of nowhere east of Las Vegas, in an area with very low population density."

And how do these differ from the mechanical artificial horizon instrument and from gyro-compasses?   EDIT: I don't understand how the latter 2 instruments work either.
MachinePorn,2puyfk,P-01S,26,Sat Dec 20 10:58:48 2014 UTC,Explain it like I am a 5 year old prodigy who is essentially a 25 year old with a technical college degree...
MachinePorn,2puyfk,ShitandPiss,11,Sat Dec 20 17:26:33 2014 UTC,I'm going to start a /r/ELI2 sub because I don't even understand your question.
MachinePorn,2puyfk,hyperbolicsquid,12,Sat Dec 20 10:07:23 2014 UTC,"Reading your question I would assume you have a fairly high technical knowledge to start with. The normal wanders are dealt with conventionally (transport, latitude etc) in a manner similar to those used on a gyro compass (DI). The flight engineer or pilots must enter a correct lat/long prior to flight which is used to set the initial flight conditions. Essentially the horizon and DI are free to gimbal in flight, whereas the INS is a stable platform, being held level in normal flight conditions (constrained angle of bank/climb/yaw). This is similar to the platform of a Segway, for example. Servo motors are used to keep the platform level, tied to earth horizontal. The simple direction indicator suffers from transport wander as the gyro within it is blind and doesn't know its latitude, so is unable to correct for the wander. They are fitted with a ""latitude nut"" to correct for the latitude of its base of operations, i.e. 55N or 23S. Operations over long distances will mean the DI will need to be synchronised with the wet compass more frequently. A gyro compass will use a system of flux gates or magnetometers to electrically determine north and slave the DI to it without pilot input (other than to monitor correct function of the system).  The only real unknown wander is mechanical (friction) wanders bringing in a divergent error in lat/long position. This is minimised by a high build quality and use of very high quality components/materials. This is efffectively corrected in flight by using a DME/DME cross cut for position fix (for the highest accuracy), a DME/VOR (2nd accuracy) or VOR/VOR cross cut (for the lowest quality position check). This radio lat/long is compared to the INS derived positon and corrected as required. These days GPS is used for some of this, but the radio nav kit is already on board so this functionality is retained for redundancy. Hope that helps. Sorry if it's not clear, I've tried my best through the fog of beer hangover.  TL:DR, gyro shit be like totes cray-cray."
MachinePorn,2puyfk,XNormal,3,Sat Dec 20 10:28:26 2014 UTC,"Wow, I think I get some of what you're saying. Thank you.  I think I just realized that while the artificial horizon and gyro-compasses only give directions, the INS is meant to indicate current lat long position, by mechanically integrating accelerations over time?  That is like asking a smartphone to use its 3-axis accelerometers and 3-axis gyros to integrate readings to indicate how far you've moved from the last fix?  How does the INS's precision compare with the MEMs sensors in today's smartphones?"
MachinePorn,2puyfk,dahvzombie,2,Sat Dec 20 11:54:15 2014 UTC,"Yes, the smart phone analogy broadly holds up. I'm a bit unsure of the precision of a chipset MEM sensor, but I would hazard a guess that the precision of an INS is greater.  My uncles old Volkswagen had a GPS system which used chip/solid state gyros for navigation when the GPS system lost signal temporarily (i.e. in a tunnel) - which as a 20 year old I found incredible. See /u/PilotKnob who gives a neat synopsis above, from a users perspective.

MachinePorn,2pl4an,RyanSmith,22,Wed Dec 17 16:11:47 2014 UTC,so these things are driven by air pressure? if not what are the slots for in the spinning element?
MachinePorn,2pl4an,Doxin,11,Wed Dec 17 16:20:37 2014 UTC,They are. Much in the same way that ones in small airplanes generally are. Though if I remember correctly the ones in small airplanes are actually driven by vacuum.
MachinePorn,2pl4an,gitgat,3,Wed Dec 17 18:59:26 2014 UTC,Any idea on how the vacuum is supplied in the torpedo? Almost seems like it'd have to have a vacuum cylinder and a pressure cylinder.
MachinePorn,2pl4an,BlackholeZ32,2,Wed Dec 17 20:49:59 2014 UTC,"not sure, probably similar to that of an airplanes method using a vacuum pump driven by the motor in the back. but here is more information I found on why they run in vacuums https://books.google.com/books?id=LS4fAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=torpedo+gyroscope+vacuum&source=bl&ots=SSSAwdy-Zf&sig=Voco4heIS-WRv9p4Pwzigc92BuE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xfKRVKqoKqfasATchIHgBQ&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=torpedo%20gyroscope%20vacuum&f=false"
MachinePorn,2pl4an,gitgat,2,Wed Dec 17 21:18:59 2014 UTC,I like how they have to specify that the petty officers are competent.
MachinePorn,2pl4an,DashingSpecialAgent,5,Wed Dec 17 23:49:37 2014 UTC,vacuum would be horrendously inefficient though. blowing air transfers much more force than suction.
MachinePorn,2pl4an,Doxin,17,Wed Dec 17 19:13:56 2014 UTC,"it is, but they also want to remove as much air from the chamber as possible to minimize drag.  I just looked it up (it's been like 10 years since I took flying lessons) http://flighttraining.aopa.org/students/presolo/special/gyroscopic.html   Most modern airplanes use engine-mounted vacuum pumps. They are simply ellipsoidal chambers into which is fitted a circular drive hub. Protruding from this hub are a number of carbon or aluminum plates, or vanes. They are free to move inside the hub's slots, drawing in air from one port and forcing it out another. Typically, the pneumatic system is connected to the port that is drawing in the air, hence the name vacuum system. Some airplanes do the reverse, providing pressure to the gyros on the panel; this is called a pneumatic-pressure system.>"
MachinePorn,2pl4an,gitgat,7,Wed Dec 17 20:04:42 2014 UTC,"oh right, the device is under vacuum, but the movement is still done by a positive pressure differential. that makes sense I guess."
MachinePorn,2pl4an,Doxin,13,Wed Dec 17 20:11:48 2014 UTC,"You suck out of one side of the box, but the air coming in the other side goes through a nozzle pointed at the gyro. From the gyro's perspective, it's getting the same as a blown stream, just in lower ambient pressure."
MachinePorn,2pl4an,P1h3r1e3d13,-2,Wed Dec 17 22:18:48 2014 UTC,"yep, someone else explained that the entire device is under vacuum, I inferred the rest myself already. thanks though."
MachinePorn,2pl4an,Doxin,4,Wed Dec 17 22:24:28 2014 UTC,I think you are correct considering early torpedoes where powered by compressed air

MachinePorn,2pl4an,ihateusedusernames,6,Wed Dec 17 16:11:56 2014 UTC,"Forgive me for not googling, but were these used to correct the direction of travel?  If so, does that mean that there is some sort of mechanical or electrical output that causes course corrections?  Is that interface visible in these photos?"
MachinePorn,2pl4an,Veto13,11,Wed Dec 17 20:58:55 2014 UTC,Those gyroscopes were used to keep the direction of travel. It's basically just something heavy that's spinning really fast and will help keep the direction by resisting to any changes of direction due to preservation of angular momentum. Basically the thing wants to keep spinning and if anything changes the direction of the spinning it will exert a force in the opposite direction (Newton's Law).  You can try this at home with a spare bicycle wheel to see how powerful a simple spinning wheel actually is.
MachinePorn,2pl4an,ihateusedusernames,4,Wed Dec 17 21:25:35 2014 UTC,"I've done the demonstration where you hang a spinning bike wheel from one side of the hub. If it's suspended from a rope or something that's free to twist, then the wheel assembly will slowly rotate. Very odd.  But the conservation of angular momentum is apparent in that the wheel can only be suspended like that once it's spinning... It's very hard to change the orientation of the axis of rotation.   I still don't understand how a gimballed mass would have a stabilizing effect on the torpedo, but I should probably read up before saying much more."
MachinePorn,2pl4an,swen83,2,Thu Dec 18 01:21:48 2014 UTC,"Hold the axel in your hands with the wheel spinning at the highest RPM you can manage.  Try tilt the axel, feel that resistance? That is how."
MachinePorn,2pl4an,P1h3r1e3d13,2,Fri Dec 19 23:50:30 2014 UTC,"You're correct. I'm no expert, but I've seen a couple of these. They could just have a pulley or an arm on the gimbal that actuates the fins. Or a potentiometer that, via some simple analog circuitry, actuates servos for the fins.  There was a teardown of a V2 rocket around here a while back. It had a pretty sophisticated electric gyro system. I can't find it right now."

MachinePorn,2pl4an,aswan89,3,Thu Dec 18 01:48:16 2014 UTC,It was most likely a simple clockwork engine that would have a angle and time clocked in when the torpedo was launched. See the Torpedo Data Computer for more info about WW2 era fire control systems.

If you look at the rear shroud, you can see at the base there are holes drilled in it. This creates a venturi effect. The more holes drilled in in, the more water ingested by it and ejected out of the back to make counter thrust. The one we used had a lot more holes drilled in it and your actually had to hold it off of what you were working on."
MachinePorn,2ph0bn,Gasonfires,2,Thu Dec 18 00:23:37 2014 UTC,That makes sense. Really rather brilliant.
MachinePorn,2ph0bn,Cobol,3,Thu Dec 18 06:14:47 2014 UTC,"How often do these need to be cleaned? Are you doing maintenance every time you hit a port stop, or is it more of an annual thing?"
MachinePorn,2ph0bn,udoubleudoubleu,3,Tue Dec 16 21:46:50 2014 UTC,"I honestly don't remember the schedule for it. We were working of different ships every week and from the bottom in nearly zero viz, they all start looking the same. The company I worked for held contacts with most cruise lines and a lot of the big cargo carriers and as far as propeller polishings went, it was roughly every three months and they stayed pretty clean if the ships maintained that schedule."

MachinePorn,2ph0bn,Arealentleman,3,Tue Dec 16 18:11:33 2014 UTC,"For testing under water they would run air through the system since you could see the bubbles under water, they use water in drydock so they can see the streams coming out."

MachinePorn,2ph0bn,CoveredInKSauce,18,Wed Dec 17 15:11:42 2014 UTC,So what's going on here?
MachinePorn,2ph0bn,Flyboy_6cm,34,Tue Dec 16 15:20:33 2014 UTC,It's a system of air/water to block the noise of the propeller to prevent easy identification of the ship by other warships.
MachinePorn,2ph0bn,Beerificus,7,Tue Dec 16 15:22:37 2014 UTC,"Also to expand, the 'noise' from the propeller is generated at the blade edge/tip, so this is why the streams are right at the edge there. Break up the water being distorted right at the blade edge.  Another way to do this is to add a circular band that connects all the blade edges together, however, this dumps a lot of the performance of the prop & also wouldn't work for something that has variable pitch blades (like what's pictured here)."
MachinePorn,2ph0bn,Vepr157,4,Tue Dec 16 17:03:56 2014 UTC,Another way to do this is to add a circular band that connects all the blade edges together   Interesting.  The 688Is have exactly this type of screw.

MachinePorn,2ph0bn,trav110,4,Tue Dec 16 18:32:30 2014 UTC,Is the one on the right the one with water spraying out of its propellers?
MachinePorn,2ph0bn,Vepr157,11,Tue Dec 16 22:19:54 2014 UTC,The ship on the left has Prairie-Masker.  OP's title is slightly misleading as the system for the propeller is called Prairie.  There is another system called Masker that consists of belts of perforated tubing around the hull that emit bubbles.  So the air bubbles in this photo are from both the hull and propellers.
MachinePorn,2ph0bn,kiwican,4,Tue Dec 16 23:21:32 2014 UTC,"I believe it is actually the one on the left, and it has air spraying out rather than water."

MachinePorn,2ph0bn,misterpok,8,Tue Dec 16 20:02:53 2014 UTC,"They were on most American post-war diesel submarines (GUPPY, Barbel, Tang classes), but they only used them while snorkeling (running underwater on diesels).  A snorkeling diesel submarine is actually much louder than a surfaced submarine running on diesels because all the noise is transmitted to the water.  Prairie-Masker eliminated much of the noise while snorkeling, but it took up a lot of space (some GUPPY submarines had one of their four diesels replaced with an air compressor for the system) and it was maintenance intensive.  Modern AIP and nuclear submarines snorkel very infrequently and are extremely quiet.  The noise of the Prairie-Masker system is much louder than the noise put out by these submarines as well."

MachinePorn,2pcwxw,MasterFubar,4,Mon Dec 15 21:56:16 2014 UTC,"That thing looks ugly. It's ugly because it's badly designed.   By the time of World War I, experience had shown that the ideal length of a cannon was something between 40 and 50 times the bore. This gun here is too short to be effective. Compare it to properly designed 305 mm guns of the same period."
MachinePorn,2pcwxw,lediablerouge,14,Mon Dec 15 20:25:29 2014 UTC,"This gun here is too short to be effective.   Isn't this the reason that it's called a howitzer?:   A howitzer is a type of artillery piece characterized by a relatively short barrel and the use of comparatively small propellant charges to propel projectiles at relatively high trajectories, with a steep angle of descent. Until fairly recently (about the end of the Second World War) such weapons were characterized by a barrel length 15 to 25 times their caliber."
MachinePorn,2pcwxw,cybercuzco,-2,Mon Dec 15 20:55:19 2014 UTC,"I don't know the exact specifications for that gun, but judging from the photo it seems to have a ten calibers or so length. I could be wrong, because it's hard to judge from a photo that's not exactly aligned.  Anyhow, look at the huge chassis they needed to carry the gun around, that thing doesn't seem to be practical. Larger caliber guns were used in ships and fort batteries. Field guns that have to be dragged around off-road become unwieldy if the bore is over 100 mm.  There's no sense in a gun that needs a railroad to be transported to the battlefield, because railroads are routinely destroyed in battles."
MachinePorn,2pcwxw,rinnhart,4,Mon Dec 15 21:07:55 2014 UTC,"The Isonzo front was even more stationary than the western front it wasn't until 1917 that significant movement occurred there were no fewer than 12 or 11 battles of Isonzos depending on how the last one is termed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_the_Isonzo     It was very common to have large caliber guns be railroad based.  They had no problems retreating and advancing was seldom an issue as most of the war was not one of maneuver and were key elements in breaking down heavily fortified lines. This one was captured most likely in 1917 when the Italian army was routed at the Battle of Caporetto also known as the 12th battle of Isonzo.  For the caliber yes it short I would say somewhere in the 20s, but that  wasn't uncommon either in large land based artillery especially among older pieces that were pressed into service."
MachinePorn,2pcwxw,vonHindenburg,4,Tue Dec 16 00:21:03 2014 UTC,makes no sense to have a gun mounted on a railroad   Makes sense when your alternative is having it dragged through the mud by dying horses at 3 mph and the front is moving so slowly that you have time to build a railroad there in the first place.

MachinePorn,2pc26g,nschubach,3,Mon Dec 15 16:00:01 2014 UTC,"Steam engines have a pressurized cylinder with a series of small tubes inside them.  You can see this in old steam engines as the main large cylinder distinctive in the older trains.  Behind this pressure chamber is where the fire is burning to heat the water. The tubes inside transfer exhaust heat from the fire to the water/steam to be used for propulsion.  Those small tubes are kind of like the exhaust in your car.  They go right through the boiler and to the smoke stack up front.  If the main pressure cylinder is weak or punctured, the steam flash boils causing an explosion.  Here is a pretty good image of what the design is (I have not seen the video, but I'm sure it goes into detail.)"

From Wikipedia   Construction on project no. 10521 started on October 4, 1989 at the Baltic Works in Leningrad (currently Saint Petersburg), USSR. Originally the ship was named NS Ural. Work was halted in 1994 for lack of funds, so that the actual fiftieth anniversary of Victory Day, in 1995, found the ship in an abandoned state. Construction was restarted in 2003.   ...   She was finally completed in the beginning of 2007, after the 60th Anniversary. The icebreaker sailed into the Gulf of Finland for two weeks of sea trials on February 1, 2007."

Even 3 mile island was pretty tame when you compare them to the reigning champions of nuclear screw ups, the russians/Soviet union.  Using more nuclear power in vessels is usually a tactical decision. Obviously being able to go years without refuel is very important for a military ship, but nuclear power in a surface ship is also very expensive and requires some very serious engineering.  One great example of a nuclear incident on a CIVILIAN surface ship is the Lepse. The ship was transporting some reactor waste in rough seas and the waste escaped the containment equipment and contaminated the inner cargo hold of the ship. The ship was docked for about 2 decades while they tried to find a way to decommission it without releasing enough radiation to give chernobyl a run for it's money.     Moral of the story. Nuclear power for ships is awesome, but only if you are not the USSR or Russia."

MachinePorn,2p7z6y,sourbrew,2,Sun Dec 14 05:17:13 2014 UTC,Its far far more expensive to run vessels off a reactor than fuel oil and thorium was not useful in the 50s because it dint make bombs and is not going to be in wide scale use anytime soon because it lacks the 60 years of experience conventional reactors have. at the moment the investment is not worth the benefits and the huge corrosion problem has not been solved.

It also lacks an active cooling system e.g. water being pumped around. The reactor on Curiosity produces a miniscule amount of power compared to terrestrial or marine designs. The MMRTG on Curiosity lacks moving parts entirely.  I'll edit with power numbers.  EDIT: Look at this. It's like comparing a candle to a car engine."

What you're seeing is the board edge-on, with ten layers, each with a variety of connections and non-connections as the circuits require.

A resistor can be made by taking advantage of how traces have, well, resistance, and the longer/thinner the trace is, the higher the resistance. You can also make inductors or heck, even full blown transformers, on the internal layers of the PCB.  People who work in the extremes, like doing very high frequency boards such as RF (radio basically), high current, and high voltage, all deal with such ideas often.

MachinePorn,2p5kkc,Shit_Lordstrom,9,Sat Dec 13 12:12:23 2014 UTC,"You da real MVP. I used to draw the schematics and give it to our CAD guys. This one old timer always said ""NO! It can't be routed! I need more layers!""  Then I come back a few hours later and he says, ""oh yeah it's done I moved onto something else."""
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,falcongsr,8,Sat Dec 13 12:24:13 2014 UTC,He is padding your expectations based on experience. It's good practice since if he misses that target and needs more layers because at the last minute you added something his commitment is shot. You are his customer and he wants to ensure you are ready. Mine do it too. The dreaded day he says it didn't fit we are typically shit out of luck. Happenned once b UT it was my fault. Added a fpgas last minute
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,falconPancho,5,Sat Dec 13 14:18:34 2014 UTC,at the last minute you added something   This is the single worst thing you can do to a PCB layout person
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,Shit_Lordstrom,3,Sat Dec 13 14:22:16 2014 UTC,You know how it is shit rolls downhill. Why do I add a fpga with crazy high speed signal integrity requirements to the layout last minute? Of course because the image processor can't deliver because vender a promised some spec and forgot to mention oh yeah no one has ever tested that portion of the processor. It worked on the last one so we assumed it did on this one.
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,falconPancho,3,Sat Dec 13 22:23:54 2014 UTC,"The best one I had was our spec called for a particular micro to be in a BGA package, which aren't really fun to route in the first place. But, I got it done and all was well. Then our purchasing officer got a notice that the BGA was going to be discontinued in 2 years time and the engineers could only find a suitable alternative in a gullwing. Completely no-ones fault but goddamn that was annoying. On the bright side, changing to a gullwing meant I could get rid of an internal signal layer."
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,Shit_Lordstrom,1 point,Sat Dec 13 22:44:19 2014 UTC,"Oh I know, but this guy always said NO! to the simplest request and he always got my stuff routed.

MachinePorn,2p5kkc,falcongsr,2,Sat Dec 13 23:00:24 2014 UTC,Mechanical Engineer here who generates MCO's for PCB's a lot. EE's and PCB layout people always claim they need more space. I start out with half of what I think they need and gradually bump it up as they attempt to place the components. Usually around the 60%-75% point they make it work.
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,addictingSmile,-6,Sat Dec 13 16:01:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah cute, but if you do a complex PCB for something like an iphone or motherboard or flight computer you do not do that by hand."
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,sirus20x6,5,Sat Dec 13 17:06:10 2014 UTC,yes you do even the super expensive $11k+ pcb routing software routes worse than a middle schooler with no training
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,hwillis,6,Sat Dec 13 17:06:18 2014 UTC,"A combination of both.  Its called autorouting and usually is for space more than anything else.  First the components are laid out in space and considerations are made for heat and proximity (short traces reduce interference).  Then you can autoroute, but its not always incredibly good.  Sometimes on smaller boards you will reroute a significant part of the board to cut it down a layer or something.  I'm sure more expensive programs are much better though."

MachinePorn,2p5kkc,hak8or,8,Sat Dec 13 19:50:59 2014 UTC,"As others said, at points. Those points are called VIA's, or places where a hole was drilled and metal put onto of the PCB material to connect the layers.  For example, here is a blown up image of where the layers are connected indicated by the lines going from layer to layer. http://www.fedevel.com/welldoneblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PCB-stackup-screenshot.png  Or another example, here are one of my designs showing the copper (metal, or a layer where signals are going) top layer and copper via's.  http://i.imgur.com/zOFngIG.png  And when you look at it from the side, you can see how the copper tubes (VIA's) connect the copper from the top layer, to the copper (grayed out) on the bottom layer. http://i.imgur.com/PofH84X.png  This is just a 2 layer board, you can also have a 12 layer board with via's going not for the full length of the board, but instead from specific layers to other layers inside the PCB."
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,420__points,3,Sat Dec 13 16:18:44 2014 UTC,What about in cpus?
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,hak8or,3,Sat Dec 13 20:25:06 2014 UTC,"Modern day CPU's are somewhat different and vary in implementation, but taking a modern day desktop processor you tend to have the CPU die (the actual circuitry containing your processing guts) and a piece of material acting as the interface between your motherboard and die.  The die itself can be many many many many layers, 24 and up. You have your transistors on a base layer and connect the transistors together with layers above the base layer composed of various forms of metals. So, kind of like a PCB but much smaller and components in the form of transistors on the bottom. http://m.eet.com/media/1083463/athlon.jpg http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Cmos-chip_structure_in_2000s_(en).svg/1000px-Cmos-chip_structure_in_2000s_(en).svg.png  That die gets put on a package which acts the interface. Here you can see the bond wires (very thin strands) connecting the die to the package. http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2CX32dzXEWc/maxresdefault.jpg https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4024/4230347287_75eef77e12.jpg  And the package itself http://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2014/01/14/227504/3c48b2eca242ae8881c3ec8f5f9b4360.jpg  How many layers are on the package I don't know, but I would assume using layman knowledge maybe just 4 or even two.  More modern CPU's have even more complex die's with more necessary connections, so you have a die that looks like this http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Cell-Processor.jpg  going to a package which with the die looks like this http://wimages.vr-zone.net/2013/05/ivy_die.jpg"

VERY fascinating.  http://youtu.be/DO104aoscxw  This is likely a chip on board where the bare die is glued to a pcb, wire bonded, then covered in epoxy.  For those at home, that's the black blob you see on some electronics with lots of traces going under it."
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,dunkm1n,2,Sat Dec 13 20:44:33 2014 UTC,"Only at select points. The idea here is you save space by having one board with layers rather than a bunch of 1-layer thick PCBs.

MachinePorn,2p5kkc,APSupernary,7,Sat Dec 13 17:13:16 2014 UTC,"Nice picture, it's cool to see a pcb cross section on here. Here's some general pcb cross section tips based on the photo.   When grinding and polishing a substrate, the uneven depth of the way the cutting plane falls across the vias (the vertical tubes) suggests  that you need to polish the bottom right end of this device further to make it even with the more deeply polished top left side.   Additionally, next time start your polishing further away from your target plane so that you can first align your edges evenly, then plan to also be on a finer grit by the time you reach the vias, at least 800. By doing this then changing polishing direction occasionally, the scratches will be shallower and the solder bumps will have cleaner edges."
MachinePorn,2p5kkc,falcongsr,3,Sat Dec 13 17:17:36 2014 UTC,"Nice, someone who knows how to make coupons. The via barrels had me worried at first until I realized it wasn't a perfect cut and polish."

On the left- and right powerhouse generators 120 rpm results in 60Hz AC power).   Edit: Thats for the older turbines in the first two powerhouses (Left and Right). The newer and larger turbines shown by the OP in powerhouse 3 spin at 72 RPM: http://c2cwtnd.net/states/washington/wa_coulee.html   Going down further in the plant we got to see the turbine shaft.

Original boilers literally were nothing more than a kettle - large tank of water with a fire underneath, and gradual improvements (starting with Richard Trevithick) saw the fire tubes added. The idea is pretty simple - fire at one end, fire tubes through the boiler giving a larger surface area, then the chimney at the other end. This creates a draw, which fans the flames of the fire, making it stronger and hotter, and puts more heat into the water, ultimately giving you much more steam, much faster, and at a higher pressure."

MachinePorn,2p2aok,kbox,8,Fri Dec 12 15:18:11 2014 UTC,"It's actually very simple.  See /u/RyanSmith's post above.  On the left is the firebox.  The fireman on the engine would shovel coal from the tender into the firebox - heat was controlled by airflow, just like a home barbecue.  The tender was a giant coal-filled car with a sloping floor so that coal kept sliding towards the engine's cab; this was later replaced with an automatic tender that just moved coal in when the engineer needed more fuel.  Smoke, from the fire tubes, exited through the smokestack.  The heat and smoke from the fire passed through the boiler, which is to the right, via tubes (obvs you don't want the water and fire to be directly exposed to one another).  The boiler was a (generally) closed system, and so the pressure from the steam in water drove giant pistons on the drive wheels, shown here next to two full-grown men, via the steam chest. The driving wheels provided locomotive force, and their direction could be controlled from inside the cab with the use of a reverser.  By increasing the amount of steam in the steam chest the engineer controlled the speed of the locomotive (more steam = more force on the pistons = faster train).  If the water level in the boiler dropped too low, the superheated water would flash-evaporate, and the instantaneous increase in pressure would blow up the engine.  Thus, spaghetti tubes, like in the OP.  Alternatively, if the engineer ran the firebox too hot, the firebox might either crack (from too many heating/cooling cycles) or simply soften, especially at the joints where the fire tubes met the smokestack or the firebox, and high-pressure steam and water would cascade in the the firebox, causing a massive steam blast (and, again, a flash-evaporation and an explosion).  EDIT: I want to add that a boiler explosion MIGHT be survivable.  The hard walls of the cab, if the engineer could duck (presuming he recognized the signs of the steam explosion quickly enough), would protect the engineer from the pressure wave.  He might suffer some burns or some hearing loss, but would maybe be OK.  A steam evacuation/explosion through the firebox would NOT be survivable, because the engineer stood or sat right next to the firebox grate."
MachinePorn,2p2aok,shapu,1 point,Fri Dec 12 14:10:54 2014 UTC,"Just to add to your post, surviving one of these things going off depends on how the boiler fails. An overheated firebox failing (also known as a crown sheet failure) dumps the entire boiler's contents into the firebox, and out the open bottom and the coal doors. Its usually not survivable because the entire cab is flooded with super heated steam, and the resulting blast usually turns the boiler into a literal flipping rocket. The failure shown on this post was not that type of failure and would only harm anyone unlucky enough to be standing next to it, the crew most likely survived with damaged hearing."
MachinePorn,2p2aok,popawell,1 point,Fri Dec 12 20:16:36 2014 UTC,The boiler is filled with a lot of water pipes. It helps transfer heat from the fire.
MachinePorn,2p2aok,P-01S,8,Fri Dec 19 04:28:29 2014 UTC,"pretty sure this is a ""fire-tube"" boiler.  So the pipes carry the ""fire""  through the tank of water.  You can see the front of the fire tubes exit into the area to which the smoke stack is attached."
MachinePorn,2p2aok,schnoper,4,Fri Dec 12 16:59:30 2014 UTC,"For those interested, here's a cutaway view. On the left is the firebox, and the smoke (and heat) travels down the pipes, through the boiler, an on to the smokestack. At least, that's my understanding. It's been a while since I've read up on it."
MachinePorn,2p2aok,ksheep,2,Fri Dec 12 17:10:49 2014 UTC,You are correct.  Most steam engines are/were fire-tube rather than steam tube.
MachinePorn,2p2aok,shapu,2,Fri Dec 12 17:33:26 2014 UTC,Thanks for the correction. That makes more sense now that I think about it.
MachinePorn,2p2aok,P-01S,2,Fri Dec 12 20:02:12 2014 UTC,"I know there is probably some theory somewhere about which types of boilers are better as fire tube, and which as water tube.  I have ZERO idea what that might be, my guess is that this was the topic of PhD theses in like 1918 or something."

MachinePorn,2p2aok,Holski7,2,Fri Dec 12 20:21:40 2014 UTC,"Apparently, there were no fatalities from this mishap.

To justify programming an existing line for a new body style that uses substantially the same material handling and welding tooling, I would guess 250 to 500 bodies would be enough to justify it vs. hand welding, particularly for a high end car.

MachinePorn,2owmx4,CarbonGod,6,Thu Dec 11 08:36:58 2014 UTC,"Specifically, the edges have a system to eject air bubbles around the prop. This reduces noise somehow."
MachinePorn,2owmx4,flattop100,11,Thu Dec 11 13:57:08 2014 UTC,It reduced cavitation.  How I understand it is the prop creates a low pressure area which creates microbubbles of vacuum.  When these bubbles colapse they smack together creating sound.
MachinePorn,2owmx4,GrandaddyFarooq,14,Thu Dec 11 00:34:36 2014 UTC,"Prairie-Masker systems are designed to disguise a ship's sonar signature. While cavitation is extremely noisy (sound like chains wrapped around the prop, slapping the hull), it's not the reason for the prairie air bubblers on the leading edges of the prop. All ships' propellers and hulls are designed to prevent cavitation because the collapse of each bubble actually pecks out a small piece of the propeller and over time will lead to serious damage. I've seen giant cargo vessels where cavitation damage completely eats holes right through the blades in areas that are more the 150mm thick. Entire sections of blades can fall off as well as severe damage to the rudder can occur. Typically when a propeller is cavitating, it's because  the propeller was damaged from impact and the change in its geometry is causing it. Also hull damage forward of the propeller can cause cavitation due to turbulent  water stream. Some ships are fitted with wake modifiers forward of the propeller to clean up the water stream."

MachinePorn,2owmx4,MangoCats,10,Thu Dec 11 02:10:23 2014 UTC,Why bronze?  like a bell...
MachinePorn,2owmx4,1percentof1,20,Thu Dec 11 02:47:29 2014 UTC,"Bronze is a very hard metal compound which is resistant to corrosion by sea water. It is also relatively resistant to cavitation which occurs along the tips of the blades while in operation. It's easy to work with and can be machined and shaped in almost any way.   If you damage a single blade, repairs can be done fairly easily by a ship yard. Alternatively, I've seen ships that have had damaged tips smoothed off and corresponding parts cut off other blades in order to restore the balance of the prop and prevent vibration."
MachinePorn,2owmx4,Ileach,7,Wed Dec 10 23:50:42 2014 UTC,"Bronze is not very hard, but it has a high stacking fault energy, which keeps it from wearing as much, mostly due to the cavitation you mentioned.  Unhardened stainless and alloy steel is harder than bronze but only hardened steel resists wear as well.  The relative softness is actually an advantage because it lets it take a smoother finish, which helps it stay efficient longer (cracks propagate from surface irregularities) as well as making it more efficient in the first place.  Bronze also has a relatively low friction coefficient.    Another important fact is that molten bronze has a relatively low viscosity compared to alloy steel and can be cast easily, especially into the thin blade sections.  There's a reason large castings are made of cast iron (which is not called that just because its cast)- casting in alloy steel is much, much harder and much more expensive."
MachinePorn,2owmx4,hwillis,4,Thu Dec 11 01:04:44 2014 UTC,"I should have been more specific, phosphor bronze as used in ships props is a very hard alloy in comparison to other brass/bronze alloys.   What you're saying is absolutely spot on. It has a fine grain structure too so it's good for casting into complex shapes and also reduces the chance of any flaws forming within the casting."
MachinePorn,2owmx4,Ileach,2,Thu Dec 11 10:46:18 2014 UTC,It might be something like Monel. It is not like they'd cut corners here.
MachinePorn,2owmx4,HAL-42b,5,Thu Dec 11 11:43:46 2014 UTC,Monel doesn't lend itself to being used as a propeller material. It's not that easy to machine and repair. It does get used as propeller shaft material in some cases. Brass and bronze are much more suitable for propeller manufacturing.
MachinePorn,2owmx4,Ileach,2,Thu Dec 11 01:35:01 2014 UTC,Monel would probably be 5-6 times as much.  Bronze is hardly cutting corners
MachinePorn,2owmx4,hwillis,2,Thu Dec 11 01:48:26 2014 UTC,Do you know if they always used  bronze or is this a new design specification as of recent?
MachinePorn,2owmx4,iToastyToast,3,Thu Dec 11 10:50:12 2014 UTC,I'm not sure exactly but I know phosphor bronze has been used for all propellers on all ships I've worked on. The oldest of these was a ship built in 1968.

Oil is pumped into the nut which extends and forces the prop further onto the taper with enough force to ensure no slip will occur between the shaft and the propeller boss. In theory you could run the prop with the nut removed following installation."

MachinePorn,2owmx4,hoofdpersoon,2,Thu Dec 11 06:37:20 2014 UTC,"Well, if nothing else, the blades would need to be longer, which would mean that you'd need a deeper hull."
MachinePorn,2owmx4,vonHindenburg,1 point,Thu Dec 11 11:50:30 2014 UTC,"next question: if so, why not more blades then 5?"
MachinePorn,2owmx4,hoofdpersoon,1 point,Thu Dec 11 11:48:44 2014 UTC,"Well, we’re past the limits of my nautical engineering knowledge, but I’d offer a couple things:  Cost and complexity – Obvious.  More blades makes it more expensive to build.  One idea on efficiency, and this is spitballing, but having more blades would mean that each one is traveling closer and closer to the wake of the blade ‘in front’ of it.  This would mean that it’s moving through more turbulent water and cavitation bubbles.  At a guess, the negative effects of this increase exponentially with the closeness of the blades and 5 might be the cost/size/efficiency sweet spot.  I don’t know how big a factor this is on a slow-turning screw propeller, but one thing that I do know from my work in steam turbines and axial compressors is that a prime number of blades is to be preferred because it reduces the chance of vibration subharmonics that can happen when you have many equally-sized subgroups of blades."

MachinePorn,2or8z5,mike_pants,8,Tue Dec 9 14:27:47 2014 UTC,"Well, since nobody else has commented on this great picture, I'll throw my 2 cents in.  This is a winch, powered by a 2 cylinder, double acting, uniflow steam engine.  There're a few different makes of unilflow engine that look pretty similar.  Maybe someone else can determine the company.    Things to note:    Take a look at the massive brake shoes on the far right.  You can see the safety guard around the crank on the far side of the winch and can just barely make out the second piston in the upper left.  The twin poppet valves at either end of the piston are usually indicative of a uniflow engine.  This setup created greater efficiencies than a regular steam engine by introducing hot steam at the ends of the cylinder and having the spent steam exit at the center, rather than having inlet and exhaust both at the cylinder head.  This meant that part of the power in the newly introduced steam on each stroke was not wasted reheating the cylinder head.    The downside was that the ends of the cylinder got hotter and expanded more than the middle, meaning that the bore could not be perfectly cylindrical and that the engine only reached peak efficiency in a fairly narrow temperature band.  I can't say for sure if this is a simple (steam is used once in each cylinder and then exhausted) or compound (steam is run through a high pressure, then low pressure cylinder) engine without being able to see the piping, or compare the sizes of the cylinders side by side.  But, since uniflow was all about efficieny, there's a good chance that it is a compound engine.  The column in the center left most likely contains a readout showing how much of the cable has been winched in and a safety mechanism that stops the engine when the cable reaches either end of its run."

MachinePorn,2oodvp,witteknokkels,19,Mon Dec 8 20:41:18 2014 UTC,It's not all that complex. High pressure (~2000 psi) steam goes into a high pressure turbine on the left. The high pressure turbine exhausts to the inlet of an intermediate pressure turbine (~600 psi) which exhausts into that huge header at ~60psi into the three orange low pressure turbines. Those little orange things on the left parallel with the floor are control valves and the red part in the back right is the generator. Siemens' website lists the output of this turbine at 300-1200MW which varies by application and how many low pressure turbines are attached.    The small buildings over to the left are probably lube oil and hydraulics with some other auxiliary systems to keep the turbine happy while you're rolling 100 tons of metal at 3600 RPM.

MachinePorn,2on845,DrSquick,4,Mon Dec 8 13:39:49 2014 UTC,"Very neat, thanks for posting this!  Do you, or anyone else, happen to know how water pressurization is handled in a modern system?  I'm guessing with electric pumps up to water towers perhaps?  It seems impossible to directly pump into faucets without a water tower in the middle.  But this is a topic I have never though about!"
MachinePorn,2on845,just_an_ordinary_guy,7,Mon Dec 8 15:18:40 2014 UTC,"Water treatment operator here.  Depends on the system.  Many larger systems use variable drive centrifugal pumps that rely on a feedback of output pressure to maintain a constant system pressure.  Water towers also do help, but it's mostly for local fluctuations, especially during times of high demand.  It's also worthy of note that there are various types of storage, which is the main purpose of tanks in a system.  There are Below ground tanks, above ground tanks, standpipes (taller than they are wide, but typically the tank is ground level), and towers.  Also, some tanks have booster pumps, which negate the need for the tank to maintain the pressure, as the booster pumps do it for them.  All told, a lot of modern systems rely on the distribution pumps to provide most of the pressure.  System tanks are part of it too, but it mostly depends on the topography, piping length (due to friction losses), and system demand.  Firefighting is one main local factor that require tanks/booster pumps to provide local pressure control.  One other thing I almost forgot to mention is that pressure reducing valves (PRVs) are used to lower pressure.  Sometimes, it is more economical to put a PRV at the service connection, but if a large area requires pressure reduction, a larger system PRV (really, a couple PRVs in parallel, with smaller and larger flow PRVs) is used.  Smaller systems may rely just on a tower.  Sometimes these systems operate during the day, filling the system to capacity, and then shut down at night when water usage drops off.  This would be for very small communities of mostly residential and smaller commercial buildings.  Where people go home at night.  EDIT:  I forgot to mention altitude valves, as my system hasn't used them in a number of years.  These would be in place of some of the system booster stations.  His description is spot on as far as I can remember.  The AV just senses static pressure of the tank to determine level, and shuts the fill valve."

MachinePorn,2on845,DrSquick,2,Mon Dec 8 16:12:01 2014 UTC,"I guess I just never thought about how pressure gets to the individual homes. Do municipalities pump water to distributed water towers for pressure, or do they centralize towers, or do they directly pump straight into the mains that provide pressure to homes."
MachinePorn,2on845,nasadowsk,3,Mon Dec 8 16:42:49 2014 UTC,"Typically there's a few towers around a system of any decent size.  However...  Towers can be at different elevations.  Sometimes, a tower has an 'altitude valve', which closes when it's nearly full, the re opens as the tower drains.  Generally, one tower in the system (the highest) is 'open', i.e. it doesn't have an AV, just an overflow.  Many pumping stations today are driven by variable speed pumps, and can maintain a constant pressure or flow into the system.  The setpoint for that can be manually entered or automatically calculated, based on system conditions.  Also, a water system can be divided into 'pressure districts', which are different zones of pressure.  There can be booster stations that transfer from one district to the other."

There's a thing called a swashplate that handles differences in pitch throughout the rotation, and a the whole plate moves up and down, called 'collective', all the pushrods connecting a set of blades to a swashplate move.

I am a machine shop owner with about 15 years exposure to various marine turbo setups, gas and diesel. The box is a water cooled exhaust manifold. It is double walled in most places with a constant flow of sea water passing through to keep it cool, because in an engine room/engine compartment on a boat you absolutely cannot have 1000+ degree temperature anything exposed for fire hazards. Automobiles have the advantage of their engine bays being mostly open to the atmosphere allowing air flow to keep other things cool from the radiant exhaust heat. Marine engine compartments are basically stagnant air so the entire exhaust system is double walled for the most part, and near the exhaust tips they will simply blow water into the exhaust stream to cool the single walled parts of the tips, the water exits with the exhaust, this keeps everything under 200 degrees."

MachinePorn,2nxilw,drive2fast,11,Mon Dec 1 23:21:37 2014 UTC,"Are you kidding? It's called mass production. When you make 1.5 million parts, it costs 1/1000 that of making a low volume, custom run. I work on industrial machinery, and the cost of this shit would make your head spin. But when you only make 200 parts a year, you need to split that overhead of your giant manufacturing company into few parts instead of many.  Also, physics. When size doubles, mass cubes. Sometimes smaller parts are much easier to manufacture. Start building a giant turbo and you run into all sorts of manufacturing grief. Giant rotating assemblies have all sorts of crazy stresses and vibration. It's one thing to build a stationary machine where the answer is add massive amounts of steel to absorb vibration. Weight matters on ships and you can't build a 6 ton turbo housing."
MachinePorn,2nxilw,motoko_urashima,2,Mon Dec 1 23:59:49 2014 UTC,"Weight matters on ships and you can't build a 6 ton turbo housing.   Not nearly as much as on a car, and yes you can, when you're dealing with pistons you can stand inside. you do know they measure ship displacement in tons, and they usually only care to the hundred mark, right?  There are mass-produced larger turbos, as the diesel engines in tractor trailers are nearly always turbocharged, and they usually use a single large turbo for that. spool time and turbo lag are large, but as I said, the need for rapidly changing acceleration is unlikely on the open seas."
MachinePorn,2nxilw,volatile_ant,1 point,Tue Dec 2 02:14:06 2014 UTC,"There seems to be a middle ground between what you are talking about (displacements in kL) and dinghies (displacements in cc) where this would be applicable and preferable to a single large turbo.  Given the right circumstances, any engineering decision can be justified.  I don't doubt that in this particular case six smaller turbos were chosen over a single large turbo for some reason or another."
MachinePorn,2nxilw,motoko_urashima,1 point,Tue Dec 2 05:26:23 2014 UTC,"let's be honest here, with the size of the intake and the turbos, which I am assuming are about 30% smaller than a garret T-3, which is what my car has, and that this is a 1 stage system because the turbos do not feed into eachother so it's not a 2 stage, the pressure isn't going to be any higher than 3 bar (or around 50 PSI). however... engine displacement /must/ be over 12 liters for this to make any sense. that's a pretty big engine by itself, and using a big turbo off a diesel rig would be easy.  the only reasons I can think of for the many turbos are spool speed in a racing boat, but it's not really practical for anything else. However, if I had a shipping container of small turbos that I /had/ to use for tax reasons or something, I'd use a small yet reinforced engine, then run a two-stage turbo on it. superdinghy or something."

MachinePorn,2nxilw,Acidlips242,2,Mon Dec 1 16:20:20 2014 UTC,"no, the exhaust gas from the engine turns the fan in the turbochargers. its not a matter of preference towards heat, just that turbos have a 'hot' side, and a 'cool' side. the exhaust turns the fan which pulls in air from the atmosphere and forces it into the engine's air intake"

MachinePorn,2nxilw,2500ak,4,Mon Dec 1 19:00:03 2014 UTC,"It looks like the low pressure turbos are in parallel.  I see a few potential advantages.  Small low pressure turbos would stay spooled up most of the time and cut down on the lag of the larger turbo.  A smaller primary compressor is more likely to salvage every last bit of energy that can be had from still-expanding combustion gasses. Especially at low rpm. A turbo can't add thermal efficiency, but it can salvage some energy that would have been lost out the tail pipe.  The high pressure turbo would have less thermal stress to deal with than it would if driven directly off the exhaust. In addition, depending on the compressor/turbine ratios I'll bet the shafts of all of them are moving more slowly than one big turbo would have to.   You'd have better heat rejection on the outlet side to the manifold. Less heat soak on the compressor that actually feeding the engine. Air heats up proportional to how much you compress it, and it becomes harder to compress and takes more shaft work. The exhaust can only supply so much shaft work, so the aftercooler and a cooler charge coming off the high pressure side probably helps increase pressure and reduces the back pressure from shaft work. That's more speculation."
MachinePorn,2nxilw,voucher420,1 point,Mon Dec 1 19:55:55 2014 UTC,Looked like some kind of coolant passage on that one in the link. It looks like that entire chamber could be flooded with some kind of coolant. This is a pretty clever design. I think I'm having a nerdgasm. Thanks for the info. Now I want to go find a Honda....
MachinePorn,2nxilw,capn_untsahts,3,Mon Dec 1 21:20:53 2014 UTC,"At least in cars, series is often used with different sized turbos, since small turbos spool up quickly (because the turbine is small and light) but big turbos move more air. So you run them in series so that at low RPM, the small turbo is going, and at high RPM the big turbo is running. More power across more of the tach."
MachinePorn,2nxilw,HAHA_goats,2,Mon Dec 1 19:34:23 2014 UTC,"Radial compressors can't boost as high as axial flow compressors in a single stage.  But axial compressors are a hell of a lot more expensive to manufacture, so if you need more pressure, placing turbos in series makes sense.  You see that configuration a lot in diesel dragsters.  Three turbos all the same size, two in parallel as the low pressure stage, and one in series with them as the high pressure stage.    Getting higher boost pressure and then aggressively cooling it effectively takes a lot of work out of the compression stroke, improving engine efficiency and power output.  So it's worthwhile.  Lots of manufacturers are experimenting with it, even if they aren't selling engines that way currently.  And in some applications the turbos will be different sizes--like Caterpillar's C15 ACERT platform--which has the benefit of enlarging the efficiency islands on the composed compressor map."

MachinePorn,2nxilw,BeerPowered,2,Tue Dec 2 03:25:18 2014 UTC,"Nope. The opposite, actually. More turbos => less lag (for the same boost). Of course that wouldn't matter...the car housing the engine and 8-16 turbos would weigh about 3 tons (instead of 2t it does now).  I'd much rather see 2 gigantic turbos with electric motors on them (like F1 has). No lag AND massive boost."
MachinePorn,2nxilw,LynxHope,1 point,Mon Dec 1 23:23:37 2014 UTC,"Several small turbos are less laggy than a big one, yes.

You can see a few feet of the red stripe the whole way down.  I am not an expert, but I think that most icebreakers work by actually riding up onto the ice and breaking the ice with the weight of the ship (as opposed to actually ramming the ice, as most people believe). So the hull shape likely has a much sharper angle at the bow to help the ships get up onto the ice. That is probably what gives it the appearance of sitting high in the water, if you compare what the bow normally looks like with ""typical"" ships we are used to."

MachinePorn,2nv18d,Raptorpowered,3,Sun Nov 30 23:14:53 2014 UTC,Most of the thrust in a rocket is reacted through the injector face.
MachinePorn,2nv18d,Sluisifer,3,Mon Dec 1 03:09:10 2014 UTC,"A decent amount of thrust comes from the expansion of the exhaust, so I believe that portion of the thrust will be transferred through the nozzle.  However, the majority of the force is going through the injector plate, which is further up.  Also note that this is a second stage engine, so the thrust typically isn't that huge.  You don't need TWR greater than 1 (though that will often occur toward SECO).  The large nozzle is there to efficiently expand the exhaust for better performance in a vacuum."

MachinePorn,2nrugb,floodo1,11,Sun Nov 30 03:57:57 2014 UTC,"Well to transport that large lattice boom crawler it would require probably about 20-30 loads on flat bed trailers. Each trailer can carry about 40,000lbs or two sections of lattice boom. A trailer just for one track, one for the super-structure, on for the house, ext.  I'm not sure of the exact weight of each slab of counterweight but it should be around 10ton each so that means only two per truck.  The telescopic boom crawler is a decent size crane too, and if I had to guess its probably a 250-300,000lb machine. With this crane on the job, you save ~15 loads at ~500$ a load. Plus you need a crane to set up the crawler so it's just a lot more efficient.  Liebherr but obviously this is just a presentation of a new system."
MachinePorn,2nrugb,OldMadGoat,11,Sat Nov 29 20:43:40 2014 UTC,from youtube:  Liebherr has developed an innovative concept for erecting LR 1600/2 crawler cranes with long wind power boom systems efficiently and safely:  Using the mass of an LTR 1220 telescopic crawler crane as the counterweight significantly reduces the amount of ballast that has to be transported and eliminates ballast handling on site.
MachinePorn,2nrugb,MTBDude,5,Sun Nov 30 00:40:06 2014 UTC,So it seems like they only do that just to get the big crane up and ready to go?

MachinePorn,2nrugb,oldaccount,3,Sun Nov 30 07:27:41 2014 UTC,I can't tell if that's just the boom bending or some lens distortion from the camera too.  Edit: I see in the video now the boom itself has major curve on it. Probably becomes much straighter under load.
MachinePorn,2nrugb,MTBDude,6,Sat Nov 29 23:44:29 2014 UTC,"The boom is actually under load as it's being raised off the ground.  If the crane isn't configured correctly, with the proper midpoints, the boom can actually buckle as its being raised."
MachinePorn,2nrugb,augmaticdisport,2,Sun Nov 30 02:26:21 2014 UTC,"It only does that on initial raising while the boom is still mostly horizontal. Once it is in operating position, most of the load travel vertically through the boom and there isn't nearly as much bend."

MachinePorn,2nrcf3,dangerchrisN,3,Sat Nov 29 16:17:46 2014 UTC,Yes they absolutely can. Excess centrifugal force caused by high RPMs can easily grenade motors. Larger industrial DC motors have always been susceptible to this and large AC motors not rated for high speed when run high above rated base speed (at mains frequency). Many PWM controllers will allow you to provide voltage at up to 400 Hz. This means a motor rated for 1800 RPM @ 60 Hz has an approximate speed (discounting slip and other losses) of 12000 RPM.
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,BMFochouno,1 point,Sun Nov 30 05:20:54 2014 UTC,"This motor however looks far too old to have had a speed controller alongside it. The rotor shouldn't stick out to the end if the windings to cause that level of damage anyways.   Side note: AC induction motors are speed controlled with a variable frequency drive (VFD), it's only the brushed DC stuff that would use PWM."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,Thermodrama,2,Sun Nov 30 06:41:02 2014 UTC,"What? VFDs use PWM technology to control voltage/frequency supplied to motor. The converter side of them converts AC to DC then the inverter side controls the RMS voltage/frequency to the motor through PWM. The PWM allows for weighting of the DC ""pulses"" that result in a pseudo-AC sign wave ultimately provided to the motor. AC drives have used PWM since day one..."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,BMFochouno,1 point,Sun Nov 30 14:56:06 2014 UTC,"Sure, they do use PWM, but it's not the whole picture. It's like saying your car is powered with a crankshaft. It is an essential part, but it's not going to work alone."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,Thermodrama,1 point,Mon Dec 1 03:10:10 2014 UTC,"I was simply trying to provide you some insight/clarification as your response sounded like you did not understand that AC VFDs used PWM technology for control. I didn't feel the need to explain the internal signals, components, and control blocks necessary to get the inverter section to generate the RMS voltages using PWM."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,BMFochouno,1 point,Mon Dec 1 12:57:09 2014 UTC,"To be frank, I did forget that fact at the time of reply. However I thought that saying an induction motor were run solely by PWM to be slightly misleading (as there is an inverter clumped in there as well), whereas a VFD is a more accurate portrayal. Sorry about that."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,Thermodrama,3,Mon Dec 1 13:57:41 2014 UTC,"Motors definitely can explode.  There are special categories of motors called ""explosion proof motors"" that, despite the name, don't really stop the explosion, but contain the explosion within the motor housing.  Electric motor explosions usually occur when vapors or flammable dust are in the vicinity of the motor."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,Bradm77,23,Sat Nov 29 18:48:37 2014 UTC,"You sure ""explosion proof motors"" doesn't just refer to motors that are enclosed so they pose no threat of igniting a flammable atmosphere? Similarly, there are ""explosion-proof lights"" that are encased in a thick glass surround, so if the bulb breaks they won't ignite any fumes."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,BikerRay,7,Sat Nov 29 19:13:34 2014 UTC,"No, there are explosion proof motors that are built to certain standards so that they can be used in hazardous locations.  See, for example, UL standard 1203 or 1836.  Source: I design electric motors for a living."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,Bradm77,7,Sat Nov 29 19:21:44 2014 UTC,"I think that's what I meant. The previous poster implied that ""explosion proof motors"" just meant they didn't blow up, not that they didn't cause ignition in a flammable atmosphere."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,BikerRay,2,Sat Nov 29 19:28:27 2014 UTC,"There are different categories of ""explosion proof"" that can include both/either explosion from within and from outside."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,Bradm77,6,Sat Nov 29 19:38:51 2014 UTC,"They don't contain the explosion, they just ensure the gasses and flames that do escape are below the ignition temperature of the hazardous atmosphere."
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,swen83,4,Sun Nov 30 00:50:35 2014 UTC,Explosion proof doesn't mean they will survive an explosion. It means they won't create an explosion.
MachinePorn,2nrcf3,FrenchFryCattaneo,2,Sun Nov 30 06:39:32 2014 UTC,"That's exactly what they mean.  I program industrial automation and deal with Ex and Class 1 Div 1 ratings at times.

MachinePorn,2nrcf3,FoxtrotZero,3,Sun Nov 30 22:51:26 2014 UTC,"Depends on your definition of explode. There's no pressure in an electric motor, so no, it can't really. They do contain a lot of energy, though, and put a lot of parts under stress, so it's theoretically possible for one to catastrophically self-destruct. I would imagine this would require operating outside of rated capcity for an extended period of time, with no regular maintainance."

Nothing that has mass can move at speeds greater than or equal to the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, the light propagates slower through mediums like air, water, and glass than it does in vacuum. It is therefore possible to accelerate particles faster than the speed of light in that medium. This is akin to travelling faster than the speed of sound, in that instead of a sonic boom, there is a sort of ""photonic boom"", where light is emitted. The light is generally high energy, since it still takes a lot of energy to accelerate particles to those speeds, hence the blue color of the light.  edit: accidentally a word"

MachinePorn,2nn4n4,Regimardyl,23,Fri Nov 28 11:37:44 2014 UTC,"The reactor itself starts up and shuts down instantly. Nuclear reactions are quick. That's why a nuclear bomb can generate hundreds of thousands MWh of energy in the span of a few microseconds (before it evaporates and thus loses the ability to generate more energy).  It's all the external machinery in a power plant that takes a long time to get online. You can't just slam a gigawatt of steam into a cold, house-sized turbine and expect it to spool up in a second (or survive).

This is very bad for neutron economy because you lose a lot of them to absorptions in the coolant. Heavy water isn't as good at scattering, but it absorbs much fewer neutrons. Of course the absorptions that do happen create tritiated water which is a pretty big problem itself.   TL;DR light water is a better moderator, heavy water is a more efficient moderator"
MachinePorn,2nn4n4,OrigamiRock,2,Fri Nov 28 18:59:21 2014 UTC,"I'm guessing it's an issue of nuclear stability, that it's easier for protium to take a neutron (making deuterium) but the energy required to take yet another (to tritium) is much greater, and then quaternium (4H) is impossible or decays <1µs. Why is tritium a big problem? And do neutrons bounce off heavy water and back into the fissile material?  I've read a bit about fission, and scientists would use stuff like carbon allotropes (specifically graphite) and cadmium salt solution to absorb neutrons or rapidly halt fission. I don't recall reading anything about how neutron moderation is controlled to affect fission."
MachinePorn,2nn4n4,OrigamiRock,2,Fri Nov 28 21:04:47 2014 UTC,"You have the physics mostly down, just a few engineering notes.    Tritium is undesirable because it's radioactive. It decays by low energy beta with a half life of ~12 years. Generally betas aren't that bad from a biological damage point of view (unless you ingest or inhale them) but tritium for some reason does more biological damage than an average beta emitter. To my knowledge there isn't really an accepted explanation for this.  The way (thermal) fission reactors work is that U235 (or Pu239 or U233) fission when hit by a slow (called thermal spectrum) neutron and release 2-3 new neutrons. Fast neutrons have a much smaller chance of causing fission in U235 or U233.    However the neutrons created by the fission process are fast (high energy) and need to be slowed down if the chain reaction is to continue. This is why (thermal) reactors need a moderator, which is a low Z material which neutrons will collide with. The neutrons will slow down with each collision until they are slow enough to cause fission.   The most common moderators are light water, heavy water and graphite. As mentioned before, light water is the best moderator and requires the fewest number of collisions to slow a neutron down. Since a protium is light itself, it takes a larger portion of the incident neutron's energy in an elastic or inelastic collision. Heavy water needs more collisions to do the job but much fewer absorptions occur in the meantime.  This means that a reactor moderated with light water has poor neutron economy and you need to enrich the fuel to maintain criticality. Conversely, a reactor moderated with heavy water is more efficient on neutrons and doesn't need the fuel to be enriched. This is why heavy water reactors (i.e. CANDU) use natural (unenriched) uranium fuel.   The cadmium rods you mentioned are used whenever you need to reduce power or shut down the reactor because they absorb much of the neutrons and reduce the number of neutrons available for fission, thus making the reactor subcritical.   I hope this explains it.   EDIT: I should also add that there is a class of reactor designs called the Fast Reactors. These don't have any moderator at all. These are generally fuelled with Plutonium, because Pu239 and Pu241 don't have any problems with fissioning from fast neutrons. They actually fission more from fast neutrons."
MachinePorn,2nn4n4,GoldenKaiser,1 point,Fri Nov 28 22:45:00 2014 UTC,"That's very well-written and understandable, and it helps a lot with understanding neutron economy. I didn't know that all neutrons are emitted fast, only that slow ones are required for fission in certain isotopes. It all makes sense now.  Thank you SO much for writing that out! You're awesome :D"

On the UH60 they use an intake barrier filter (IBF), which is basically a few big ass cotton air filters, IE K&N, which are coated in oil.

But then it's often just more feasible to use lots of security cameras.  Did you ever find a solution to the blueforce tracking issue? For the system to truely work on its own it needs to be able to differentiate between threats and non-threats. It won't do to have the robot calling the police whenever someone comes into work in the morning. A few things have been proposed, but they each have failings. Facial recognition needs to be near-perfect and gets tricky at a distance. Pass phrases are not secure. And marker badges or what have you are vulnerable to forgery.   What did you do that brought you close to robots?"
MachinePorn,2nf8ub,HumidNebula,1 point,Wed Nov 26 18:07:29 2014 UTC,"Agreed, completely autonomous is still a ways off. Besides unless you have a direct response force, at best you have a roving security camera that can just as easily be avoided or disabled, and no one has seriously considered giving UGV's weapons yet.  Our system worked by looking for differences in an environment between subsequent scans, and was mainly used to scan a perimeter fence and look for things that had moved or holes in the fence. It used some off the shelf SLAM type software with some custom coding to basically just continously map the enviornment, it could operate GPS denied but didn't need to.  We never ""solved"" blue force tracking but it wasn't an issue, it would ping when it saw a disturbance above a set threshold and security personal would look at video and determine if it required further human observation.  It was not meant to interact with large amounts of people, just augment existing security forces.  Probably more troublesome was things like tarps or trees which move regularly and can make noise and would ping the system.  They could be squelched or suppressed but then you had virtual holes in your system where the rover really wouldn't detect anything.    Still it was infinitely better than foot and vehicle patrols which are limited based on personnel requirements. It was just a fancy set of extra eyes that constantly moved around. It was also used for when there was detection of door opening events or just to confirm that someone left or arrived, on a 100 acres+ campus you can't always be everywhere at once.  strangely enough my engineering discipline has nothing to do with robotics. I originally worked on a project that used the exact same UGV to detect low level chemical and radiological signals to basically be a first alert for a chemical spill or environmental disaster.  It was specifically useful for this as you could do a very labor intensive task (searching with a detector for a chemical that was hazardous) 24/7 with virtually no overhead.    I was the project manager for that, and part of our evaluation was ""hey it already has a camera and SLAM"" we can basically tweak the software and just let it look for changes in the physical environment.  I'm sure there are groups way ahead of us, we never got into the UAV side.  Honestly I'm always tempted to start a company, but there's holes in the legality and it's not my strong suit on the engineering side. also the per unit costs are still a little too high.  Give it 5 more years and you'll start seeing more UGV's doing domestic security."

MachinePorn,2nav3z,BrowsOfSteel,9,Mon Nov 24 21:56:48 2014 UTC,There was certainly color photography in 1948.  I think the reason it looks odd is due to the lighting with some coming in from outside and the rest from industrial lights.

MachinePorn,2nb5rf,Dongo666,1 point,Tue Nov 25 20:03:05 2014 UTC,Why is it smoothbore? Is it like modern tanks and ships having smoothbore barrels so they won't damage the different and complicated shell rounds they use?
MachinePorn,2nb5rf,professorbooty25,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"Rifling would cause too much friction. Barrels can withstand short burst of say 50-100 rounds. But when you are firing thousands out of each barrel in seconds, the barrels would be destroyed instantly.  As in they would cook off the rounds stored in them as they are in this system. You would get a pipe bomb instead of a gun."

MachinePorn,2n9ah3,Fingermyannulus,8,Mon Nov 24 18:24:42 2014 UTC,"I doubt the system is accurate enough that parallax matters.  With such systems, the reason you are using two guns at 9,000 rounds per minute is to put a huge cloud of flying metal into the expected path of the missile.  A small bit of spread kinda helps, like with shotguns and skeet shooting."

MachinePorn,2n9ah3,fts902,4,Mon Nov 24 18:57:21 2014 UTC,"GSh-6-30, actually. The GSh-30K is a twin-barrelled autocannon, the 6-30 is a gas-operated Gatling gun.   And the thing I'm basically required to post every time the GSh-6-30 comes up:   On the Mikoyan MiG-27 the Gsh-6-30 had to be mounted obliquely to absorb recoil. The gun was noted for its high (often uncomfortable) vibration and extreme noise. The airframe vibration led to fatigue cracks in fuel tanks, numerous radio and avionics failures, the necessity of using runways with floodlights for night flights (as the landing lights would often be destroyed), tearing or jamming of the forward landing gear doors (leading to at least three crash landings), cracking of the reflector gunsight, an accidental jettisoning of the cockpit canopy and at least one case of the instrument panel falling off in flight. The weapons also dealt extensive collateral damage, as the sheer numbers of fragments from detonating shells was sufficient to damage aircraft flying within a 200 meter radius from the impact center, including the aircraft firing."

MachinePorn,2n8sdp,SirLanceOlong,5,Mon Nov 24 10:25:46 2014 UTC,Is there currently any research being done to make these more powerful?
MachinePorn,2n8sdp,maxout2142,15,Mon Nov 24 14:49:12 2014 UTC,Of course but its very difficult because the force comes from accelerating a tiny mass to a very high speed. (F=ma) the whole point of a hall thruster is that it carry's a very small mass of propellant so it can be used for deep space missions. Also it doesn't take very much force at all to move a small probe in microgravity.
MachinePorn,2n8sdp,dsvii,2,Mon Nov 24 16:02:31 2014 UTC,"Part of the problem is this: there's a trade-off between efficiency and power.  E=p2 /2m  So for each particle ejected from the rocket, you want the greatest p/m ratio. However, this implies that each particle has a high kinetic energy. Double p/m, and E quadruples. Therefore, rockets with high specific impulse have high power at low thrust. High thrust requires very, very large amounts of power."
MachinePorn,2n8sdp,misunderstandgap,2,Mon Nov 24 18:54:02 2014 UTC,"I'm sure that its a matter of discovering more efficient ways of converting the power, no different than a 1940's engine burnt many times more fuel for far less power than a modern engine on similar ground."
MachinePorn,2n8sdp,maxout2142,3,Mon Nov 24 21:16:54 2014 UTC,"No. You'll never get more efficiency out of an engine than Carnot efficiency, you'll never get more power/area out of a solar panel than local insolation, and you'll never get more specific impulse out of a rocket than the energy you put in. I don't know what inefficiencies remain in Hall-effect thrusters, but the equation I gave is a hard upper limit on the efficiency of a rocket.  p/m will never be greater than sqrt( (2*E)/m )"
MachinePorn,2n8sdp,misunderstandgap,2,Mon Nov 24 21:46:30 2014 UTC,Not these but VASIMR plasma rockets are a good alternative
MachinePorn,2n8sdp,DrStickyPete,9,Mon Nov 24 16:20:20 2014 UTC,Not yet. I was at a conference this weekend and their chief engineer said they think vasimr becomes better when total power exceeds 50 kW. That is according to their estimates for a system they have not finished developing yet.   There aren't any fiscally possible missions on the horizon with that kind of power.
MachinePorn,2n8sdp,Lars0,0,Mon Nov 24 16:49:49 2014 UTC,"Define fiscally possible. Within NASA's current budget or within our nations GDP potential? Not to be political at all, but the amount we were/are spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, if I were dictator, we'd build one of these."

As a matter of fact, they're already moving away from that. Also, the development of the C-803 had quality control as one of its primary objectives, so I would be careful not to overstate the quality issues of Chinese military equipment."

MachinePorn,2n2xz1,Vepr157,2,Mon Nov 24 00:46:13 2014 UTC,Both the Harpoon and Exocet are around 40 years old and the C-803 (a 15-ish year old missile) doesn't seem to outperform either.  It's production is being limited because it is already obsolete and better missiles are on the way.

MachinePorn,2mwhkv,BaconSunday,13,Thu Nov 20 22:21:40 2014 UTC,"It's called a crosshead, makes the whole shebang more efficient and such."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,SeraphTwo,19,Thu Nov 20 23:29:32 2014 UTC,"It basically allows for such a long stroke. Without it, the conrod would hit the botton of the liner before the piston had reached top dead centre (TDC).  There is a seal on this rod called the piston rod gland seal or stuffing box. It allows the crankcase to be isolated from the scavenge space which in turn means that there will be no contamination of the crankcase and lubricating oil by products of combustion. That's why the oil in these things is always very clean.  They also run a dry sump system. Oil is pumped by electric powered motors to the various parts of the engine. It then drains to the bottom of the crankcase through some gratings into the sump/tank below the actual engine.  The crosshead is actually quite difficult to lubricate and as such (on Sulzer engines), is fed from crosshead lubricating pumps which pump at a higher pressure than the main oil pumps and feed the bearing via an articulated arm.  If I remember right, the MAN engines don't have these pumps and instead use telescopic oil lines which force in oil on every stroke when the line is compressed."

MachinePorn,2mwhkv,bettorworse,2,Fri Nov 21 01:00:42 2014 UTC,So Im wondering. Is this the most cost effective/efficient way to create the power need to drive the ship its in? Just take a diesel piston engine and make it huge?
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,smokumjoe,8,Fri Nov 21 07:35:48 2014 UTC,These engines are the most efficient internal combustion engines in the world that are mass produced. Most have a thermal efficiency in excess of 50%.
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,Ileach,2,Fri Nov 21 08:45:17 2014 UTC,"So,, yeah?"
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,smokumjoe,5,Fri Nov 21 08:46:20 2014 UTC,"Yes, very efficient. Take oil tankers; there is no cheaper way to transport oil other than via a pipeline. Yes, a 300,000 tonne cargo of crude oil on a tanker may need an engine that burns 70-90 cubic meters of fuel a day but it would cost so much more to transport it any other way."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,Ileach,2,Fri Nov 21 08:52:16 2014 UTC,"The best way to look at it is that it costs only cents/barrel to transport oil. Economies of scale. I don't have the exact numbers, but shipping on a foreign tanker costs $.05/bbl, and shipping with a Jones act ship is somewhere around $.09/bbl."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Fri Nov 21 17:08:29 2014 UTC,"You could probably make turbine engines that were more efficient, but only at certain specific power settings."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,Ileach,1 point,Fri Nov 21 14:54:24 2014 UTC,"Not really viable for this kind of ship. Even the gas (LPG) carriers which burn off the cargo residue as fuel use these engines which are modified to run on gas. Steam turbines were used when fuel was cheap. After the oil crisis, many massive steam powered ships were scrapped after being built due to them being so uneconomical to run. Steam is still used to power things like cargo oil pumps and tank heaters but for ship propulsion, nothing is more efficient and reliable than a large 2 stroke crosshead engine."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,diesel_stinks_,1 point,Fri Nov 21 19:58:57 2014 UTC,"I mean turbine internal combustion engines, probably with some kind of heat recovery system. In stationary power generation systems, turbines can get up to around 60% efficiency with some kind of waste heat recovery system. In this case, the turbine would be driving the prop instead of an alternator."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,Ileach,1 point,Fri Nov 21 21:48:24 2014 UTC,"There would be massive transmission losses through the reduction gear required to reduce the speed of the turbine to a suitable propeller speed. These engines to incorporate waste heat recover by means of an exhaust gas economiser. When on passage, these can allow the vessel to run without firing the main boilers. Water is fed through the economiser and is used to power any steam ancillaries."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,diesel_stinks_,2,Fri Nov 21 21:55:21 2014 UTC,"There would be massive transmission losses   I wouldn't say massive, but certainly enough to eliminate any gain from using a turbine engine. If the prop could be run without a transmission, a turbine could certainly be more efficient."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,Ileach,1 point,Fri Nov 21 22:12:41 2014 UTC,"I used to work on a ferry that ran alongside the largest high speed ferry in the world. During that time, our old vessel was the one making the profit while the other ferry which was gas turbine powered (4x Kamewa water jets), continually ran at a financial loss. The only reason it was there was to get the passengers to book with the company. Eventually it became completely uneconomical and was sold along with all the others in the fleet. (Look up Stena HSS).  While the theory of directly coupling a propeller to a turbine may result in a more efficient propulsion system, it just wouldn't have the torque required to turn the necessary prop required to drive a ship with 300,000 tonnes of cargo. The size of prop that could cope with 3600 rpm would also be so small that, again, it wouldn't propel the vessel."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,jdmason,2,Fri Nov 21 22:33:37 2014 UTC,"Ok so maybe somebody could explain this to me.  I understand how engines work, and I understand that combustion in the cylinders drives the pistons which in turn drive the crank. In normal engines (car, bike, etc), these explosions are fast and the rpm's are high. However, in these massive ship engines, the rpm's are significantly lower. What I don't understand is how this is possible. Doesn't the combustion typically occur quickly (think, explosion)? If so, how do fast explosions translate into slow rpm's?"
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,schnoper,1 point,Fri Nov 21 14:40:04 2014 UTC,"It's not really the explosion that drives the piston.  Though it's often described that way.  It's really the increased pressure caused from a combination of the increased temperature (which increases pressure via PV=nRT ) and the conversion of long chain hydrocarbons into mostly small C02 and H20 (more molecules, e.g. the n  in PV=nRT )."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,chevelle1258,1 point,Fri Nov 21 16:57:36 2014 UTC,"My guess is that the momentum from the pistons is what allows it go to so slowly. I don't remember exactly how much it weights, but i remember it was in tons. If you got enough fuel to explode to get that moving i think it should be enough momentum to continue the engine's rotation. That is kinda how a smaller ICE works after all."
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,Ileach,1 point,Fri Nov 21 18:32:34 2014 UTC,"I worked on the smaller Sulzer 7RTA-84 TB and it produced 39960 hp while weighing in at about 960 or 980 tonnes. We could run at 84 rpm maximum and as slow as 20-22 rpm. Momentum helps a lot. Not only do you have all the moving parts of the engine and flywheel, you also have the massive propshaft and propeller too."

MachinePorn,2mwhkv,The_Fortune_Soul,2,Fri Nov 21 02:16:08 2014 UTC,That's awesome. I'm in awe of that engine.
MachinePorn,2mwhkv,Ileach,5,Fri Nov 21 02:19:26 2014 UTC,"Almost all vessels of this size are powered by large 2-stroke crosshead engines; large tankers, bulk carriers, container ships (box boats), and some car carriers.  This one is a big engine but they do make some relatively small 2-strokes too with cylinder bores of 300mm.

MachinePorn,2mwdvz,simoneb_,10,Thu Nov 20 20:51:00 2014 UTC,"Well the F102 and F106 could fire the Genie which was a nuclear anti aircraft rocket.  The theory was that a genie would neutralize a sector of sky (IIRC) 1mile in diameter (possibly bigger).  This theory assumed that the russkies would charge their bombers over the north sea in huge formations to overwhelm the US and Canuk air defences with numbers at high altitudes.  I assume that the Bomarc was a similar (ground launched in this case) concept. Overkill for one aircraft, perfect for ten, or twenty, or more!  It also took care of the problem of precision intercepting moving targets at long distances."

MachinePorn,2ms02a,mdp300,1 point,Fri Nov 21 16:22:37 2014 UTC,They weren't the first to go wings but they were among some of the first to go with adjustable wings. They had a car with a huge rear wing and the angle of attack was controlled with a foot pedal. The driver 'opened' the wing by bringing it to flat during the straight aways for less aero drag.

MachinePorn,2ms02a,ZeosPantera,32,Wed Nov 19 15:44:35 2014 UTC,"Well, they didn't. It's actually even more interesting than that. The engines on the rear (snowmobile engines btw) drove fans which created a partial vacuum underneath the car which was sealed all around with plastic skirting, giving a downforce greater even than the weight of the car itself. In fact, when debuting the car, they reportedly considered doing so with the car upside down on the ceiling. An all around amazing machine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral_Cars#2J"
MachinePorn,2ms02a,vanished_again,21,Wed Nov 19 15:59:24 2014 UTC,"They don't.  The fans are driven by a two stroke 45hp engine.

It would be impressive to get any plane around a racetrack, keeping up with even modern F1 cars would be something else. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's a long way away and till then we could have quite a lot of fun making unlimited cars. We need tech that can pack a whole lot more power into a much smaller vehicle, and maybe a couple decades of unlimited cars will get us there sooner."
MachinePorn,2ms02a,P-01S,1 point,Thu Nov 20 00:52:47 2014 UTC,"Hmm... Perhaps use an F1 style car body, but propel the car with a turbojet engine (afterburning might require too much fuel?). Draw intake air from under the body, and include active aero and thrust vectoring to maximize grip... Actually to keep from roasting following cars, the exhaust would need to be directed slightly upwards, anyway."
MachinePorn,2ms02a,qm11,2,Thu Nov 20 01:10:10 2014 UTC,"It doesn't matter how much technology you have, you still have to obey the laws of physics. If you suddenly lose a few thousand pounds of normal force on your tires midcorner at 150mph, you're going to end up off the track and/or in the wall no matter what. It's the same reason relying on traction control, stability control, ABS and 4wd when driving in snow is a bad idea. The car will do it's best to help if you make a mistake, but it still doesn't have the ability to turn, accelerate or brake quicker than available traction will allow."

MachinePorn,2mp9l6,garethashenden,5,Wed Nov 19 05:18:03 2014 UTC,It's a pattern. You use this to make the mould and then cast the actual propellor in metal.
MachinePorn,2mp9l6,unautre,2,Wed Nov 19 09:41:43 2014 UTC,"I always assumed foundries just had reusable patterns on hand.  Why this intensive process? Is each propellor specific to a ship, or are the patterns destroyed in the manufacturing process, or...?"
MachinePorn,2mp9l6,rtwpsom2,6,Wed Nov 19 12:21:57 2014 UTC,"The wood prop blade and hub you see are the reusable portion.  The molds are sand casts impregnated with something that holds them together as long as they are handled carefully.  Once the brass alloy is poured and has cooled down the mold is broken apart.  During the war factories would produce hundreds of the same prop, especially the ones in the 9 foot to 18 foot range. Destroyers used a 9' screw so there were literally hundreds of each made just for US production. Cruisers and most Aircraft carriers used 16 foot screws so there were fewer but they were all the same design.  However the most common by far was the 18'3"" screw of the Liberty and Victory ships.  It saw some modification as time went by but the design was used for several thousand ships and was manufactured by at least fifteen different companies."

MachinePorn,2mlz9t,plaidzebra,1 point,Tue Nov 18 18:27:32 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, it really helps you understand what you're asking the machine to do, if you've worked the handles yourself. Same goes for CAD. You should have to read manual prints first. We have people who have no idea how part geometry works and how tolerances stack.  I also think you should have basic computer literacy before you start doing programming. We had one guy who had no concept of folder and file structure and his folders were a mess. He often fucked up my stuff, too. (On the plus side, I set up the CAD program the way I wanted it and then write protected the INI file so he couldn't change it.)"

MachinePorn,2manip,Zebba_Odirnapal,2,Sat Nov 15 06:57:50 2014 UTC,"Hi,  I am not sure how other companies do it. In our case, the menthol cigarettes were same as the non-menthol brands. Same paper, same filter, same perforated plugwrap. The only thing that changed was adding molten menthol as the cigarette rod was being made (i.e. tobacco meets paper and glue to produce a continuous rod of cigarette before the filter is attached).  Regarding menthol, they had it in crystalline form and they used a container to warm it slightly above room temperature to become liquid. Then they pump it through a small applicator on the paper as the rod is formed. It dries after some time but the flavour is still there in solid particle form, I guess.  Regarding fibreglass in the filters. All the filter in the Karelia cigarettes were made from cellulose acetate (machine operators called it ""artificial wool"").

This machine allows a private individual to buy tobacco and cigarette tubes separately, paying only regular sales tax, and manufacture their own cigarettes, thereby skirting the manufacturing tax. They rent the machine after buying the tobacco and tubes and when it's all said and done, you have a carton of smokes for less than $30."

If you grew up in the era where doctors advised smoking, endorsed certain cigarette brands, whatever, then sure, I can see you having a claim that the companies should have made it be clear how dangerous their product was. I'll even give you that people who became addicted at that time and haven't quit, some of them probably just can't quit even if they wanted to. But the later someone started smoking, the less that applies."
MachinePorn,2manip,ErniesLament,2,Fri Nov 14 21:16:35 2014 UTC,"Yes, but people don't demonize people who commit suicide.  People who kill themselves don't do it because they're stupid or lazy or think that somehow they will survive.  They do it because they have something wrong with their brain and they think that killing themselves will fix it.  So why demonize smokers? Especially those who want to quit? Smoking fills a niche in many people's lives.  It provides a small boost of chemicals that makes people feel better.  The same goes for alcohol.  Some people start using these chemicals to get through their day, but in the case of tobacco, it is very very difficult to quit due to the addictive nature of nicotine.  You can't blame the tobacco industry 100%, but you also shouldn't vilify people who smoke.  They're victims to their addictions.  Less than 15% of smokers are able to kick the habit cold-turkey."
MachinePorn,2manip,rainbowlolipop,2,Sat Nov 15 00:31:20 2014 UTC,"people don't demonize people who commit suicide.   Yeah they do.   They do it because they have something wrong with their brain and they think that killing themselves will fix it.   More like the experience of mere existence becomes intolerable... Mental illness is usually but not always a factor. A commonly used analogy is people jumping out of burning buildings. They don't want to die, but they don't want to burn, either.   So why demonize smokers?   Some people like to feel better about themselves by looking down on others.  Aside from that, economic impact (leading preventable cause of death in the US, for example), and non-smokers generally dislike the smell of cigarettes. Second hand smoke isn't much of a concern these days, thanks to laws that make smoking in public buildings illegal.  The tobacco industry is more deserving of the blame, though."

MachinePorn,2m9sfb,MasterFubar,10,Fri Nov 14 11:32:47 2014 UTC,"The rotor goes into auto-rotate mode once the aircraft was up to speed.

This gave the aircraft the ability to take off with little to no runway, but cruise at speeds similar to a fixed wing (slightly slower in general).  Consider it a predecessor to the Osprey."

Or think of it as a really fast helicopter.  The turboprop engines divert some exhaust up through the mast and out of jet tips at the ends of the rotors.  The weird thing to me is that it has collective and cyclic controls like a helicopter. One of the big advantages of a typical gyrocopter rotor is that it doesn't need blade pitch controls...

The scows are then brought here to Poplar Island, where the Vicksburg unloads them. Basically, the Vicksburg uses those nozzles to inject water at fairly high pressures around that large suction head called the ""snorkel"". The snorkel pulls the material up into the dredge where it is then pumped to the dump site, more or less filling a large hole with mud to rebuild an island.   The island is a terrapin sanctuary, and conveniently completely free of predators."

He's a smart guy overall but believes that only the stuff he buys, like Chevy cars, are still superior than anything else. I once argued with him that a Lamborghini Diablo was faster than a Chevelle but he flat out refused to concede.  I think deep down he knows he's wrong but thinks this way to justify his self. He also believes that only the stuff he personally buys is worth getting and anything someone else buys is sub par and a waste of money."
MachinePorn,2m506v,costanza_vandelay,4,Thu Nov 13 14:53:34 2014 UTC,"I too was like that once. I'm a classic car guy; someone who grew up lusting after Mopar muscle cars even more so than the fairer sex. I would have sworn that there was nothing faster on the road than a 1969 Dodge Superbee w/ 440x6. So I know the feeling. . . but I was also 15 at the time. Mid-30s? He should know better.  Instead, your friend should argue about the spirit of the car, and what it represents.  A Diablo is faster, sure. But a Chevelle, when it was new, was something a steel mill worker could aspire to own, work on and modify. If they were music, a Diablo was a symphony, perfectly refined art, but a Chevelle was rock, it was Metallica's Black Album; nothing short of pure, unrefined, brute force on four wheels (the mechanical embodiment of the cracked and weathered hands of the man that owned it).  Joe America, on a blue collar job, after a lot of blood sweat and tears, could build that Chevelle into a street machine which could come close to, and maybe even beat, a '95 Diablo VT (the slowest iteration) in a straight line (let's be real after all, taking a corner in a blown Chevelle could kill you). Look at the figures:   1995 Diablo VT 0-60mph @ 4.6sec, and 1/4mile @ 13.0sec 1970 Chevelle SS 0-60mph @ 5.3sec, and 1/4mile @ 13.6sec   Stock? No way.

That's over 100 horses per litre, which is no small accomplishment for a naturally aspirated road car engine. Show me a GM small block that can do the same without a blower.  Now that might sound like a distinction purely of engineering merit, but it has its merits for a driver. That kind of power from that little capacity means you have to go up high to get, you're not relying on Torque. Now low end grunt is nice for a lot of things, but round a race track, you don't wanna be spinning your wheels every time you accelerate.   It's the reason this seasons Formula 1 cars are causing problems  for drivers known in the past for their smoothness—Vettel, Button, to an extent Kimi. They aren't used to so much torque at low speeds when they don't have the downforce to control it."
MachinePorn,2m506v,TomShoe,2,Thu Nov 13 16:02:08 2014 UTC,"Not saying that it's not impressive but the whole power per liter thing is blown way out of proportion. If it's not for a racing league where displacement is limited then all that matters is power to weight of the engine and power curves. Something that looks engines do very well in. However that isn't to say they are better, just different. Not everything has to be a competition on what's better or worse"
MachinePorn,2m506v,asshatnowhere,0,Thu Nov 13 17:42:55 2014 UTC,"Okay, but if we're comparing too performance cars, of course competition is important, and in that context, track handling matters."
MachinePorn,2m506v,TomShoe,1 point,Thu Nov 13 18:48:03 2014 UTC,"yeah but handling is mainly down to weight and centre of gravity. an LS has very low weight (relative to it's displacement and output) and a low centre of gravity (thanks to pushrods). furthermore it is a very small engine despite it's relatively large displacement. here is a 6L ls3 next to a 3.8 liter v6. now would I take a LS over a s65? nope. I would probably be able to drive a car with less torque and more rpms better on a track, however that's just me, there could be another driver which would prefer more low end torque to suit their driving style."
MachinePorn,2m506v,asshatnowhere,0,Thu Nov 13 19:23:59 2014 UTC,"Depends a lot on the car, and just as importantly the tire, but all other things being equal, most people will have an easier time higher revs, and less torque down low. Power's only good if you've got the grip to put it down, and on a road car the sort of grip you're likely getting from the tires isn't going to stop you from spinning the wheels occasionally if you're developing too much torque down low."
MachinePorn,2m506v,TomShoe,1 point,Thu Nov 13 19:48:49 2014 UTC,"Specific output for one thing. It produced 414 hp, from a hair over 4 litres. That's over 100 horses per litre, which is no small accomplishment for a naturally aspirated road car engine. Show me a GM small block that can do the same without a blower.   From what I remember, 7K RPM in the Z06 427 was tough enough for an factory OHC valvetrain with a warranty.  The counterpoint to this is that the same 427 engine develops more torque at 3K RPM than the S65 does at its peak.   Now that might sound like a distinction purely of engineering merit, but it has its merits for a driver. That kind of power from that little capacity means you have to go up high to get, you're not relying on Torque. Now low end grunt is nice for a lot of things, but round a race track, you don't wanna be spinning your wheels every time you accelerate.   It almost sounds like you're arguing that the S65's relative lack of low end torque is an advantage compared to an engine with more low end torque. Driving styles vary, but that sounds like a problem I'd get used to."
MachinePorn,2m506v,mschaef,1 point,Thu Nov 13 20:43:16 2014 UTC,"Fun for burn outs around town but high round a track, I'll take high peak RPM over low end torque unless I've got the grip to use all of it, across my rev range. Most of the time on a track you'll be running it pretty high anyway, but the last thing you want is to be spinning your wheels through a corner."
MachinePorn,2m506v,TomShoe,-1,Thu Nov 13 20:18:51 2014 UTC,"No one is gonna argue against the LS3s power/mass, but if we're looking at the whole package, lets talk usability. I guarantee you the S65 is an easier engine to live with around town, and for most people, will be easier to extract the best results from on a track. The engine won international engine of the year in the its category something like five years in a row. They don't give that award out just for being impressive from an engineering standpoint. It's a damn fine engine.  As for economy, is it really fair to compare a car that ceased production in 2013 with one that began production the same year? Especially given how big a goal efficiency was for the new LT engines.  I'll give GM credit though, at least they've stuck to their guns with the new small blocks. I'd way rather have an LT1 in my car than an N55. Never been a big fan of turbos."
MachinePorn,2m506v,TomShoe,2,Thu Nov 13 20:38:40 2014 UTC,"Advantages over, say, the LS3? Similar power from 30% less displacement. Higher efficiency, reduced emissions, DOHC allows greater control of variable timing, and oil changes are easier thanks to the filter being at the top of the engine. There's honestly not much between them, as they weigh roughly the same and mileage figures are similar between the M3 and the LS3 powered Camaro. The M3 is quicker to 60, though.   But the original point of the joke is not that the LS is a joke, but that every time there's a thread about a European engine, some LS fanboy comes in and shits all over it because the LS is the best engine in the history of ever."
MachinePorn,2m506v,trainspotting2,3,Thu Nov 13 19:43:31 2014 UTC,"Similar power from 30% less displacement.   Why is this an advantage, given that the weight and fuel efficiencies are so similar?   Higher efficiency, reduced emissions,   It's difficult to find any documentation that supports these claims   DOHC allows greater control of variable timing,   GM includes camshaft phasing in the current LT1, and the Viper v10 can independently adjust the timing of the intake and exhaust cams. Aside from varying lift, OHV has a great deal of potential for VVT. This not to mention the packaging and cost advantages of a single camshaft in the center of the block.   and oil changes are easier thanks to the filter being at the top of the engine.    Yeah... this is pretty nice."

MachinePorn,2m506v,trainspotting2,2,Thu Nov 13 20:35:06 2014 UTC,"The BMW engine is definitely an impressive engine, but the LS has some very good things going for it as well; they have a lower center of gravity, a lower weight, smaller physical size, superior gas mileage and it costs a fraction what the S65 does.   Comparing an 08 Corvette to an 08 M3 the Vette gets 16/26 with 430HP from a 6.2 LS3, which GM will sell you as a crate engine for right around $6200.  The M3 gets 14/20 with 415HP from a 4.0 S65, which BMW will sell you as a crate engine for 15K.  Again, not saying the S65 isn't an impressive engine, it is, but the LS has a lot going for it too...They're different design philosophies and different price ranges; just the fact that a pushrod truck engine can compare whatsoever with a DOHC, dual VVT 8300RPM V8 says a lot."
MachinePorn,2m506v,SnapMokies,0,Thu Nov 13 19:46:51 2014 UTC,"And I'm sure if someone posted a pic of an LS7, someone would show up with reasons a BMW engine is better.

MachinePorn,2m3gcs,asimovwasright,11,Wed Nov 12 18:33:20 2014 UTC,"The Raumer S (Selbstrantrieb) was a heavily armoured minesweeper developed and built by Krupp for Germany during the Second World War.   Weighing over 130 tons, this behemoth was effectively two sections articulated in the center, and moved by massive steel wheels that were 2.7 m in diameter. The vehicle was 15 m long and 4 m high.  The track widths differed between the front and rear to encourage a wider sweep path. Each section of the Raumer S was powered by a Mayback HL90 engine generating 360 hp and 3600 rpm.   Although armaments were not placed on the prototype which was created, there were plans to mount 7.92mm MG-42 machine guns for both anti-personnel and anti-aircraft roles.  At the end of the war the existing Raumer S prototype was captured by the US Military; although what happened after it’s capture is unknown.

MachinePorn,2lzucz,Tonka_Tuff,1 point,Tue Nov 11 23:56:57 2014 UTC,"Well I'm not sure about the build specs of this bike but it is already on mountain bike rims from the look of it.  The reason I was mentioned 29ers is that they would be more stable at high speeds,  but maybe it is true that the smaller rims are better in this case.  If you went with a tubeless carbon wheel set they would be incredibly light and very strong.  Switching to disc brakes would allow you to have a lighter and stronger wheel set as it eliminates the need for a braking surface on the side of the rim.  Also then you are not relying on rubber brake pads which would be useless at slowing you down from even moderate speeds where wind resistance is going to have less of an effect and the added weight of the jet engine would increase the load in the brakes.  I would also be worried about the small conventional axles and wheel bearing overheating and failing at those speeds which is why I mentioned through axles.     I'm no bike expert though and also not a rocket scientist so I could be wrong.  The bike side of the project just seems under built."

From the Wikipedia page:   The US Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) was a 2.5 MW thermal nuclear reactor experiment designed to attain a high power density for use as an engine in a nuclear-powered bomber. It used the molten fluoride salt NaF-ZrF4-UF4 (53-41-6 mol%) as fuel, was moderated by beryllium oxide (BeO), used liquid sodium as a secondary coolant and had a peak temperature of 860 °C. It operated for a 1000-hour cycle in 1954. It was the first molten salt reactor. Work on this project in the US stopped after ICBMs made it obsolete. The designs for its engines can currently be viewed at the EBR-I memorial building at the Idaho National Laboratory."

On a large steam engine, it's used to rotate the main engine into the proper position for starting, or to move it when maintenance is being performed.    You can see a smaller version HERE on one of the shafts on the USS Olympia, which is on display in Philadelphia.  Steam turbines also have jacking gears and motors.  For them, though, the purpose is to keep the rotor turning slowly after it has been shut down.  When heated, while in operation, a turbine rotor will bow slightly.  If it is not kept slowly rotating while it cools, it will 'freeze' with a permanent slight bend in the shaft, which will throw off the balance thereafter."

MachinePorn,2lqjxc,WRno7,5,Sun Nov 9 20:31:20 2014 UTC,The global hawks application is more of a wide area high altitude reconnaissance whereas the predator operates in a lower ceiling and engages ground targets as well as recon

MachinePorn,2lqjxc,SabreJD,2,Sun Nov 9 23:58:38 2014 UTC,It's likely.  Global hawk is also a considerably larger and heavier airplane so a jet engine might make more sense in that respect.

The cheaper predator drones have been much more successful in their role.  The reason the Global Hawk didn't get axed is because they were meant to replace the retiring decades-old U2 manned spy-plane.  It's been a troubled rollout.

MachinePorn,2loud6,kallekilponen,8,Sat Nov 8 22:59:48 2014 UTC,Those belugas are awesome! I was working in the UK for a few months this year at a place where Airbus wings are made and these took off from there every few hours. My normal office overlooks an airfield where the dreamlifters take off from as well and in my opinion the belugas are way cooler.
MachinePorn,2loud6,Speedyq24,27,Sat Nov 8 23:05:34 2014 UTC,"Those are turboprops.  That is where you take a jet engine and connect a propeller to the turbine, so the prop is producing say ~80% of the thrust and the jet engine is only producing ~20%.  They usually fly between 300 and 600 mph, but burn significantly less fuel than their jet counterparts.  The trade off is that the high bypass jet engines on say a Boeing 747 are able to fly higher and faster.  So engine decision comes down to various factors including initial cost, operating parameters, and operating costs.  For this specific airplane, turboprops were chosen as the most logical propulsion method.    Example:  An F-22 uses low-bypass afterburning turbofans so it can go very fast with a low profile.  Fuel consumption is not an issue, maintenance costs are not an issue, and initial cost is not an issue."
MachinePorn,2loud6,CorporateNterest,7,Sat Nov 8 19:53:04 2014 UTC,"More like 8% thrust, most of the power comes from the prop, it may pull about 4000 shaft horse power and only get about 800lbs of thrust from the exhaust. There is not a direct equivalent between thrust and horse power but it can be assumed that 1hp equals about 550 ft-lbs per second."
MachinePorn,2loud6,whaleoil_beef_hooked,6,Sat Nov 8 20:21:44 2014 UTC,"You can make the thrust ratio anything you like depending on the gearing of the prop transmission and the dynamics of the rest of the engine.  If we want to be pedantic, then I would say 8% is a number that only applies to a certain engine(s).  Ultimately the point I'm trying to make is that a turboprop is both a jet and a prop engine."

The Super Guppy has turboprops making almost 4700 hp a piece. So the turboprops are a huge upgrade for that airframe.  So what /u/martinky24 said still holds true for this particular aircraft. The original engines were inadequate after the guppy modifications (and barely adequate when the B-29 was converted into an airliner). So what do you do to keep it flying?

MachinePorn,2lhzhz,gordongraham28,16,Thu Nov 6 22:28:35 2014 UTC,"In 2012, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,837 kWh, an average of 903 kilowatthours (kWh) per month.   In one hour, the 3512C generates enough power for 1.35 homes for a month. Wolfram Alpha kindly informs us that the instantaneous power is sufficient for 200-400 American homes.  So, yes, 500 is a stretch, but not by as much as you'd think."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,obsa,3,Thu Nov 6 22:36:24 2014 UTC,"That's not really how electrical power sizing works.  This genny, at its full rated load, creates enough power for the average consumption of 2-4 hundred homes. But it needs to be able to handle peak load. That would be many times the average, and this genny would be completely undersized. You would probably find the distribution panels shedding load as soon as everyone comes home in the evening, also when they get up in the morning.  There's also distribution losses and power factors that would mean that the actual load 'at the plug' so to speak, would require higher power at the genny end.  If I had one of these machines only, then I wouldn't connect it to 200 homes, I wouldn't even connect it to 100 homes. At 500 homes it would be comically undersized and i would be expecting a lot of angry phone calls if people were still able to charge their phones! Think about it this way. This thing is about 1.2MW, with losses lets call that 1MW. For 500 homes that means it has 2kW per home. An electric kettle is around 2kW.  Peak load is a key driver in sizing power supply. You might find the phenomenon of tv pickup an interesting read on this general topic."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,burketo,7,Fri Nov 7 18:02:52 2014 UTC,"I dunno what your average power consumption is where you live (USA someplace?), but my Norwegian house (we're two people living here) has an average power consumption of 36.81kWh per day (calculated over a year).   Our house consumed 63.28kWh yesterday (it's autumn, and getting a bit chilly, so we're using electric heaters), and I can also see this number on my energy meter... it would mean that our house consumes (on average) 2.63kW continuously throughout the whole day at this time of year.  1.225MW / 2.63kW = ~466 homes.  I do realize peak consumption in a neighbourhood would vary quite a lot as a day progresses, but I was speaking figuratively. So the math checks out.  EDIT: Cat's website says this unit maxes out at 1.5MW, though. Not 1.2MW like the title says."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,demux4555,8,Thu Nov 6 23:04:52 2014 UTC,"Depends on the load factor design. Prime power vs standby vs emergency.  An engine designed only to be used as emergency backup is allowed to run a lot ""hotter"" and thus much more available power. An engine designed to run continuously at full load is required to have a lot more safety margin and so the power available is much reduced."

You may well have a regular supply by tanker or bowser, or it can be connected to a larger external supply.   We had a similar unit on an oil rig. It was hired to power the rig while it was not working and mothballed. Rather than put hours on the rigs engines and running them on low load (diesel engines don't like that), they hired a containerised gen-set like this. We just plumbed in a fuel supply and return from our own system. Although the hired generator had a smaller capacity than our main generators (1.3 MW vs 2.2 MW per generator), the small generator actually used more fuel per day than the big units. We usually burn 7000 ltrs of diesel per day. The smaller Cat generator used 9000 ltrs."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Ileach,5,Thu Nov 6 22:35:50 2014 UTC,Easy to estimate: 1225ekW -> assume 92% generator efficiency -> ~1332bkW flywheel power figure ~205g/kwhr BSFC -> assume 0.849kg/L -> ~322L/hr at full power    at 50% power figure ~250g/kwhr * 666bkW  -> ~196L/hr at half power
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,drewtam,6,Fri Nov 7 00:50:58 2014 UTC,Or you could just check the cut sheet.  100% Load = 236.9 L/hr (89.0 gal/hr)  75% Load = 262.2 L/hr (69.3 gal/hr)  50% Load = 185.0 L/hr (48.9 gal/hr)
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,nemoid,3,Fri Nov 7 16:04:50 2014 UTC,"Looks like the sheet has some typos in it. 89gal/hr does not equal 236.9. 89gal/hr equals 336.9 The 75% load fuel L/hr is higher than the 100%. Besides, 236.9L/hr is way too low, the efficiency would be unrealistic."

MachinePorn,2lhzhz,gordongraham28,7,Thu Nov 6 22:27:47 2014 UTC,"Often these machines come with removable ""walls"" the size of the radiator they fasten to the outside to make a box to protect it when its being used. These generator's boxes are removed because either they were recently built and sitting in the factory yard, or at a caterpillar service center being worked on.   Example: http://www.equipmatching.com/uploads/images/1g1114op9ct.jpg"
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Casualbat007,3,Thu Nov 6 23:09:58 2014 UTC,Covered to stop any foreign objects getting into places they shouldn't. There would usually be air filter boxes and silencers attached when operational.
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Ileach,3,Thu Nov 6 22:37:36 2014 UTC,"As is the exhaust system.  I agree its done for transportation, but not sure this one goes in a ""box"" like suggested. In industry, parts that may be easily torn off resulting in contamination of the engine, are often packaged separately and installed after delivery.  I've not worked on this particular style unit, but I have seen similar units installed in shipping containers, or due to the big skid, this one may even just sit outside as is.  Not saying this is exactly whats going on, but i've seen it a number of times."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,swen83,1 point,Fri Nov 7 03:13:50 2014 UTC,"I have seen this, at work we use the 200kw models for our systems. That is the exhaust port and is closed for transport. When you actually put it into use you take the cover off and connect it to where you want the exhaust to go.  This will probably go in an factory, large machine or even a marine ship. Where the piping will be connected later on."

MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Ileach,3,Thu Nov 6 22:44:30 2014 UTC,Why.
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,W360,14,Thu Nov 6 23:21:06 2014 UTC,"It's popularly known as the o-ring engine. Instead of designing a block with actual channels for oil and water it has piping running around it everywhere with o-rings and gaskets that constantly fail.  Its electronic unit injectors randomly decide to not work for no reason at all, only to work again the next time you start it up. They are non-user-serviceable and the only way to repair them is to send them in. If you open one up Cat will get mad and start talking intellectual property laws.  They run at 1800 rpm which is practically self-destruct mode for an industrial engine. Compared to a proper engine running at 720rpm or less, their lifetime and service intervals are ridiculous.  Their filter housings are idiotically placed, seemingly in order to fit in a tight space rather than with serviceability in mind.  tldr it's a train engine, and it should stay in trains. It has no place in a power station or onboard ships."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,wartzilla,6,Thu Nov 6 23:28:51 2014 UTC,"The one we had on our rig (mentioned elsewhere in this thread) required us to shut it down every 8 days and replace fuel, oil and air filters. It took about 4 hours to do and was a total pain in the arse."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Ileach,4,Thu Nov 6 23:34:25 2014 UTC,"Ours are nowhere near that bad yet, but they're only two years old.  Oh, I forgot to mention how much they suck ass at partial loads. They do. Suck ass at partial loads, I mean."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,wartzilla,3,Fri Nov 7 00:33:07 2014 UTC,"We had to do it as it was apparently part of the lease agreement for the engine. I'm not sure if it was on request of the lease company or if it was an official service schedule. Whatever it was, 200 hours is a bit short in my eyes."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Ileach,3,Fri Nov 7 00:41:44 2014 UTC,"I know of some 3516 Cats sold as continuous mains parallel machines, but running at standby rating, with a 12 month guarantee at this power level. The poor customer thinks they are doing well, getting standby power at continuous power price, but in a few years these engines will crap themselves and be out of their guarantee period, and the customer will be up for some horrific bills. Cummins have also just done a public release of their 16 cylinder QSK95, a 95 liter engine pushing 3500kVA at 1800RPM with a 25000 hour between overhaul and up to 1000 hours between service. Big money in big high speed diesels, and fierce competition."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Kawarau,5,Fri Nov 7 00:56:43 2014 UTC,"Well, it looks like it is made for trains, doesn't mean anyone is dumb enough to buy one for their train!"
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,wartzilla,4,Fri Nov 7 08:48:07 2014 UTC,They are what we at sea would call medium speed engines. Up to about 150 rpm is slow speed (large crosshead 2 stroke engines). 150-950 would be medium speed and anything over 1000 rpm would be considered a high speed diesel. These aren't set-in-stone figures but they are a good guideline.
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Ileach,3,Fri Nov 7 00:49:07 2014 UTC,"I seem to recall that the back-up diesel-generator on the US Navy submarine I was on 1977-81 ran around 750-RPM. 10 cylinder, ran 10 years before an overhaul. Ran fine, didn't need it, was just scheduled so lots of bits replaced."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,spinningmagnets,3,Fri Nov 7 01:11:06 2014 UTC,"If you were on an SSN or SSGN, how many hours per year were you using the generator? Surely you use the reactor while at sea and hook up to the local grid while in port?"
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,misunderstandgap,2,Fri Nov 7 01:02:55 2014 UTC,"We ran it for short periods on a regular basis for training and also to verify that it still works as designed, and ensuring that it starts easily.  You are correct that we used ""shore power"" when next to the pier, and nuclear generated steam underway for main propulsion."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,spinningmagnets,3,Fri Nov 7 01:40:06 2014 UTC,"See, as a heavy equipment mechanic I see the external oil and cooling lines a plus. Easier access for service and repair.   In my world there caterpillar engines and machines are a solid first for performance and up-time. I'm familiar with this engine as the powerplant for 785 haul trucks though. Almost a totally different application. The beating those things take is brutal."
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Tennessean,3,Fri Nov 7 03:18:34 2014 UTC,If the 'lines' were built into the block like in any serious marine engine design there wouldn't be any need for service or repair of them.
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,wartzilla,1 point,Fri Nov 7 23:57:21 2014 UTC,"It's never really a problem though. Usually they end up getting resealed when the engine is rebuilt. So on your marine engines the oil goes from the pump internally into the block? Not a bad idea, I'm not sure about caterpillars reasoning there. What about turbo lines and aftercooler lines?"
MachinePorn,2lhzhz,Tennessean,3,Fri Nov 7 02:07:54 2014 UTC,So what you're saying is nothing stops a Caterpillar except for itself?

MachinePorn,2lhzhz,nutral,3,Fri Nov 7 11:14:59 2014 UTC,"I have no experience with MTU, but they are high-speed engines so I wouldn't be surprised.

MachinePorn,2lih0b,jonathanrdt,2,Fri Nov 7 18:43:18 2014 UTC,"I was kind of hoping for more specificity than that.  The price is whatever, maybe they haven't set one yet, but greater than $500k?  You might as well have just said ""It's a new airplane"". There are different classes of pilots licences, I'm wondering which one you'd need for this. The manufacture's page also talks about grass strip capability, and I know you can put a Cub or similar down on whatever uninhabited patch of open land you feel like.  I also know farmers and crop dusters sometimes put down on rural roads, so I'm wondering what the regs surrounding that are in conjunction with this thing's capability. If getting into that stuff isn't your cup of tea, that's cool, but that's where I was trying to go."

MachinePorn,2l9lsi,hexapodium,6,Tue Nov 4 16:02:47 2014 UTC,It's time to remind the world that nobody but MTT is making turboshaft-powered motorcycles and that this needs to change yesterday.
MachinePorn,2l9lsi,IronMew,15,Tue Nov 4 17:13:00 2014 UTC,"There's a reason why, though - on a bike you generally want a wide power band with a fair amount of low-end torque, which is better delivered by a reciprocating engine than a turbine (which in general are designed to offer a variable power output at a constant RPM, the dependent factor thus being exhaust temperature). I have no idea why the turbine bike only has two gears; presumably it's a size or engineering issue related to their operating RPM being much higher than  rather than a design choice, since ideally you'd want as many gears as possible (as with diesels) to make the best use of your power band. You also have possible problems with clutches and starting, since a turbine can stall much, much more easily than a piston engine.  On the other hand, if you're after sheer numbers of angry horses for minimal weight outlay (and with very high power:volume ratios) then they're great. Also, you get to be the only maker of insane turbine-powered bikes, but the dirty secret is that they're not very good except on very long, flat, high-speed tracks."
MachinePorn,2l9lsi,hexapodium,3,Tue Nov 4 19:00:49 2014 UTC,"All perfectly good reasons not to make a turbine motorcycle, but the mindblowing amount of sheer condensed awesomeness is reason enough to make it."
MachinePorn,2l9lsi,IronMew,2,Tue Nov 4 19:11:35 2014 UTC,"Sounds like a good fit for a turbo generator, software control, and DC motor combination."
MachinePorn,2l9lsi,Realworld,1 point,Tue Nov 4 23:19:38 2014 UTC,"Weight and size become problems with that option, though. The MTT is already a very long bike by sportbike standards, mostly because the turbine is much longer than a twin or 3-cylinder.  If we were to be uncharitable, and just go ""right, slap a high-current turbogenerator on the power shaft and an AC (much more appropriate in this scenario) motor where the transmission is, and cram some VFDs in there for control"", we still have a bike that's likely to be 6-12"" longer in the critical section for geometry, and now has much bigger heat management issues (control electronics and power electronics are both a serious cooling issue). They will also add substantial weight - perhaps another 20-30kg all told, or ~10% of the weight of the bike.   If we are more charitable, and we go ""money no object, custom designs, but strict series hybrid with no storage"" then we could probably come up with a turbine which integrates the generator into the free turbine rotor design for added compactness and weight saving, and go to a hub motor design for size reduction at a cost of some additional unsprung mass on the rear suspension - a hub motor of appropriate power might weigh 5-10kg but that's manageable, on the order of the difference between a shaft and a chain drive. You still have to deal with the heat issue, of course.  The best option if you're desperate for a turbine bike is a radical departure: a microturbine (perhaps 50-100hp) plus some ultracapacitors, paired to a drivetrain as discussed before. The microturbine is much lighter and smaller and sips fuel rather than glugging it down like a full-size one would, and provides enough power to cruise at up to the top speed, plus perhaps 10% for charging the caps, while the ultracapacitors provide power to accelerate, which is the only time a sportbike needs the throttle to be open very much at all. Regenerative braking on the rear wheel also helps to charge the capacitors and maintain a power reserve for coming out of a corner, though this is less of a benefit than in a car as ~70-90% of brake energy comes from the front brake in a bike. The turbine stays at maximum efficiency almost all the time. This is, of course, vaguely what F1 is doing as well with the MGU-K and MGU-H. Unfortunately, at these power levels you're better off with a small, computer-controlled piston engine again rather than a turbine; microturbines are still firmly on the drawing board and test bench although they do promise better efficiency in theory, once the kinks are worked out."

MachinePorn,2l5tk0,speedofdark8,5,Tue Nov 4 03:34:46 2014 UTC,"I grew up about two miles from here. One of my coolest memories of the dam was following the floods of '97(?). A bunch of trees and debris got washed into the lake and took something like three years to drift from the river inlets to the dam. They were worried about a lot of it getting sucked through the hydroelectric turbines and damaging them, so once a lot of debris started to pile up they opened up the spillway at the top and let huge amounts of water and debris flow over the dam into the river below. Watching a bunch of fully grown trees and logs flying down a waterfall that made them look like toothpicks was something surreal.  For a sense of scale, try to find the people walking across the yellow footbridge over the river."
MachinePorn,2l5tk0,beer_is_tasty,4,Mon Nov 3 20:53:28 2014 UTC,It's pretty impressive that there were such huge infrastructure projects like this and Grand Coulee being constructed in the middle of WW2.  I don't think any European countries had that luxury during the war.

MachinePorn,2l5tk0,KosherNazi,5,Wed Nov 5 22:28:55 2014 UTC,How can they build a dam with the river still flowing through the site?
MachinePorn,2l5tk0,oldaccount,15,Mon Nov 3 16:42:19 2014 UTC,"You build what parts you can, including a bypass for when you need to plug up the river.  When you are ready, you damn off the river and let it flow through the bypass/overflow.  Then you finish the dam, close off the bypass and let it fill up the lake.  You can either block all water downstream (which I imagine is not usually done since some places rely on water from the river) or you cut the flow downstream and let the lake fill slowly over time."
MachinePorn,2l5tk0,nschubach,2,Mon Nov 3 17:27:42 2014 UTC,"That makes sense. Most other dam projects I'm familiar with, the river is diverted at the very beginning of the process to make site preparation a lot easier. I guess in this case they waited until everything was mostly done on the sides before they diverted to finish the center section."
MachinePorn,2l5tk0,oldaccount,2,Mon Nov 3 17:35:12 2014 UTC,The Southern Pacific Railroad ran through an area next to the damn. They decommissioned the railway line after they built the new line and used the existing train tunnel to divert water through. The dam then had a coffer dam built to divert the water and complete the infill. Most dams have water flow through for a portion of the project so you dont have to wait for the temp river diversions to be complete before you start.

My point is that in the picture you still see the river flowing through the work site so there was no coffer dam in use at the time. Perhaps they just waited to divert the river at the very end of the project when the center section needed to be poured.
MachinePorn,2l5tk0,oldaccount,3,Mon Nov 3 17:31:32 2014 UTC,"They're building it in sections.  Each section probably gets it own coffer dam, and they'll divert the river at the very end for the last section."

Two questions, was the space outside the pressure hull around the sonar dome free flooding or part of the boat's trimming mechanism? And you mentioned one that was experimenting with slippery chemicals to reduce drag. Did you mean the chemicals were painted on the hull or released into the water under power?  Thanks"
MachinePorn,2kzf41,kuznec82,4,Sat Nov 1 17:04:33 2014 UTC,"The sonar dome was free-flooding just like the ballast tanks and the vents were closed when the submarine submerged.  To my knowledge, the only US submarines not like this were the Seawolfs, which had sonar domes always open to the sea to avoid going over a displacement limit set by the Secretary of the Navy (they might have changed it back to normal after Seawolf went on active service).    Polymers are released from pipes on the hull so to control the boundary layer, the thin layer of slow-moving water that is what actual causes drag on the submarine.  Both the US and USSR experimented with them, as it could make submarines faster and quieter at high speeds.  However there was only enough polymer for a few hours of use, so it never went beyond the trials stage for both navies.  It might make a come-back if the technology improves."
MachinePorn,2kzf41,Zoltar23,3,Sat Nov 1 17:11:25 2014 UTC,I'd imagine environmental concerns and regulations would also play a factor today.
MachinePorn,2kzf41,Totschlag,2,Sat Nov 1 20:03:44 2014 UTC,"To my understanding, it would probably be used primarily for emergency situations, as it is a consumable. Still, while releasing polymers into the ocean is not a good thing, it depends heavily on the polymer. We already release tons and tons of polymers into the ocean today (albeit not in dilute form), in the form of litter."
MachinePorn,2kzf41,IQBoosterShot,1 point,Sat Nov 1 21:16:17 2014 UTC,"So the polymers were low-MW polymers which increased the viscosity? This makes the boundary layer thicker. Naively, this seems like it would make submarines slower."
MachinePorn,2kzf41,ipoopbycandlelight,4,Sat Nov 1 19:42:03 2014 UTC,"If I remember correctly they were very high molecular weight, something like 100,000.  They inhibit vortex formation and keep the boundary layer laminar, which reduces drag.  Look up ""submarine polymer ejection"" on google and there are a few interesting articles."
MachinePorn,2kzf41,just_an_ordinary_guy,2,Sat Nov 1 19:45:58 2014 UTC,"That makes sense, although I would be curious as to how they cause a polymer with a MW that high to dissolve and mix rapidly enough with seawater.  Ah:  ""Diluted polymer solutions."" That makes sense."

MachinePorn,2kzf41,rristuccia,4,Sun Nov 2 00:56:13 2014 UTC,"This is the ELI5 version: I served on a fast attack submarine. Basically the rear half of the submarine was the reactor compartment and engineroom. The reactor is the energy source for generating steam to run the main turbines (they turn the propeller), and the turbine generators to generate electrical power. In the engineroom is a small control room that contains the Reactor Plant Control Panel (RPCP), the Electric Plant Control Panel (EPCP), and Steam Plant Control Panel (SPCP). The RPCP controls the operation of the reactor and supporting systems. The EPCP controls the electrical generators and power distribution systems. The SPCP controls the steam flow to the main turbines to control the speed and direction of the propeller. Out in the engineroom are several watchstanders who monitor and control various pieces of equipment related to: propulsion, electrical power generation and distribution, air conditioning, making fresh water, hydraulics, reactor plant support, etc... The link below has some really good information on nuclear submarines:  submarines"
MachinePorn,2kzf41,sabanin,3,Sun Nov 2 01:26:32 2014 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to write back.   I have a pretty good handle on the theory of sub design, but not much practical knowledge on how to actually run one.  What I don't understand is the lack of automation. Eg, when the Officer of the Deck orders 20 knots, instead of manually setting the steam and coolant flow rates to get the desired number of turns, why not have the helmsmen (now pilot/copilot) simply turn a knob and have a computer actuate all the valves?"
MachinePorn,2kzf41,maxout2142,3,Sun Nov 2 01:47:07 2014 UTC,"Something to remember is that submarines are weapons of war and are built to withstand some of the conditions they may see in combat. Simple, manually operated systems are more likely to withstand battle damage. Steam flow increases or decreases directly impact the reactor, only people who are nuclear trained can perform operations that impact the reactor."
MachinePorn,2kzf41,ubermason,2,Sun Nov 2 14:40:30 2014 UTC,"This is simply a guess, but I imagine it is so that someone with knowledge of nuclear propulsion is the only one to directly interact with the reactor in order to avoid any issues or danger."
MachinePorn,2kzf41,Kawarau,1 point,Sun Nov 2 07:26:10 2014 UTC,Correct. Basically anything that can impact the operation of the reactor can only be done by a properly trained person.

Why don't US submarines use reactor scoops for their coolant water like the Soviets?  I understand SUBSAFE was the main driver for their removal, but why weren't they ""safe""?"
MachinePorn,2kzf41,vtjohnhurt,3,Sun Nov 2 00:08:11 2014 UTC,"Counter-props are hard to design, build and maintain.  The Soviets were better than US in making counter-props (I have no idea why) and they used them on most SSNs and SSGNs made from the late 60s to early 80s.  They were phased out because they are louder than seven-bladed skewback screws at high speed.  The idea behind the scoops was that there was a large pipe open to the ocean that lead into the machinery spaces so that water could be easily sucked into the boat just by the motion of the sub through the water.  I don't think it was unusually dangerous or anything because they didn't remove them from Narwhal, but it ran counter to some regulation about the size and number of hull penetrations.  Scorpion also had them too, apparently.  I've tried to find photos or drawings of them, but I haven't found anything."
MachinePorn,2kzf41,jorsiem,2,Sun Nov 2 00:15:41 2014 UTC,Counter-props...   I think you should throw that up on the /r/WarshipPorn FAQ. The question gets tossed around a fair bit.
MachinePorn,2kzf41,ClarenceBoddickerr,2,Sun Nov 2 00:28:39 2014 UTC,"Ahh, okay, thanks!  Follow-ups:    Counter-rotating screws may have fallen out of favor, but aren't modern day pump-jet propulsors just counter-rotating screws and a cowl assembly?  IIRC, pump-jets have quite a few moving parts.  Given the divergence in submarine design between the US and USSR (now Russia), is hydrodynamic shaping even more important today?  I remember you mentioning how modern US subs caused more turbulence when compared to their counterparts..."
MachinePorn,2kzf41,nighthawke75,3,Sun Nov 2 00:28:58 2014 UTC,"Pump jets have a non-moving part (stator) and moving part (rotor), so you don't have to deal with coaxial shafts, which makes them a lot simpler.  The cowl adds some drag and the weight of the pumpjet is a lot more than a regular screw.  It can also be less efficient than a regular screw at some speeds.  But it's much quieter.  Hydrodynamics is very important today because of non-acoustic ASW.  I believe you asked me about it a few months ago, but suffice it to say that hydrodynamics is very important for stealth as well as speed."

MachinePorn,2kvi5c,Zenben88,15,Fri Oct 31 16:02:37 2014 UTC,"From the wikipedia article on subsea cables:   Cables can be broken by fishing trawlers, anchors, earthquakes, turbidity currents, and even shark bites.[32] Based on surveying breaks in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, it was found that between 1959 and 1996, fewer than 9% were due to natural events. In response to this threat to the communications network, the practice of cable burial has developed. The average incidence of cable faults was 3.7 per 1,000 km (620 mi) per year from 1959 to 1979. That rate was reduced to 0.44 faults per 1000 km per year after 1985, due to widespread burial of cable starting in 1980.[33] Still, cable breaks are by no means a thing of the past, with more than 50 repairs a year in the Atlantic alone,[34] and significant breaks in 2006, 2008, and 2009."
MachinePorn,2kvi5c,ProfessorPoopyPants,6,Fri Oct 31 16:08:08 2014 UTC,"I'm guessing it's a cost comparison between replacing the cable without burial, and replacing the cable, with burial, which breaks 10x less since it's buried."
MachinePorn,2kvi5c,ProfessorPoopyPants,1 point,Fri Oct 31 19:34:09 2014 UTC,Yes. Thats true. These are not the kind of cables you want to break. The Warranty surveyor will demand trenching of the cable.
MachinePorn,2kvi5c,HMS84,4,Fri Oct 31 20:17:27 2014 UTC,"keep in mind you have to pull these cables all the way to the surface, route around them, splice and put back every time they break.  that's huge.  compared to having to dig them out of a few feet of sediment, reducing incidences of cable breakage is well worth it, let alone reducing it 10x."
MachinePorn,2kvi5c,kspacey,1 point,Sat Nov 1 00:40:40 2014 UTC,"Nothing, but a lot of water isn't deep enough for that. Out to the edge of the continental shelf you're in danger of the cable being caught by boat anchors, trawl nets etc. They don't bury the cable out in the deep ocean."
MachinePorn,2kvi5c,mollymoo,6,Fri Oct 31 20:44:44 2014 UTC,Thanks. Holy shit that is complex.  Lets take guesses on what it cost to build.  350 million...uneducated guess.
MachinePorn,2kvi5c,Webonics,5,Sat Nov 1 09:35:57 2014 UTC,"The entire system, maybe. I expect the crawler/trencher itself is probably sub-$50mm"

MachinePorn,2kvi5c,THE_CENTURION,-4,Fri Oct 31 17:08:58 2014 UTC,Doubtful. Even the most blinged out M1A2 Abrams is sub-$10m. People frequently overestimate the costs of things when they get into the millions and beyond.

MachinePorn,2kvi5c,jvnk,1 point,Fri Oct 31 20:14:48 2014 UTC,"I would guess $50 million is about right.  It takes a lot of specialized equipment to operate at the pressure of the deep sea and the extra cost for a one-off vehicle raises the price.  Operating expenses alone for the ship and a rig like that are probably close to $100,000 per day."

I spoke with historians when I visited over the summer and, from what I'm told, all Fresnel lenses were ground to specification in France and shipped to the light stations. The lens at Point Sur was shipped around Cape Horn and installed in 1889. It is made up of 580 separate pieces, stands 9 ft (3m) tall and weighs 4,330 lbs (~1970kg). The entire mechanism including the pedestal and brass clockwork weighs 9,500 lbs (4318kg).  The light was supplied by four wicks that burned whale oil. The lens was able to project the light 23 miles out to sea.    Another fun fact. The light stations along the west coast of the US are all timed at different intervals so mariners can pinpoint their positions. The time between the flashes at Point Sur is 15 seconds."

On a rear loader you have some of the same capabilities, except for being able to move the whole truck quickly. This way you can move the chute side to side, up and down, as well as forward and backward by moving the truck.

The only downside to them is they dont mix as well, and generally because of the weight they can only haul 9 yard loads vs 10 yards on butt dumps depending on the location.

MachinePorn,2kpie0,lowbee,2,Thu Oct 30 02:28:08 2014 UTC,But why? Surely it's way over engineered since rear loaders are just trucks with a different tail end. Is there any benefit apart from the driver can see were the concrete is going? And what's the pod on the back do?

MachinePorn,2kpyzg,amayernican,26,Thu Oct 30 01:51:41 2014 UTC,"I can help!  A Pitot tube is used to to measure wind (or any fluid) speed.  How it works: There are two holes, one at the tip, and one on the side of the wall (you can see it on the underside in the picture).  The two holes are connect by a bit of liquid (kind of like in a p-trap under your sink). Due to some effects of fluids (Bernoulli equation), you can measure the movement of the liquid that's connecting the holes to get the wind speed.  Schematic here  There's also a design that uses a membrane pressure sensor. Here's what that looks like."
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,rudolfs001,3,Thu Oct 30 04:46:02 2014 UTC,"Neat! I know how to fly (very novice, mind) and I never knew how a pitot tube worked. I figured it was connected to the airspeed connector somehow, but I had a membrane in my head more like your second example.  Very cool how much about flying, even this, is explainable with Bernoulli's work."
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,lachryma,1 point,Thu Oct 30 06:50:17 2014 UTC,"Actually, Bernoulli's Principle is not the proper explanation of how airplanes generate lift... The truth is much more complicated than the brief explanation that people are usually given."
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,P-01S,3,Sat Nov 15 08:25:13 2014 UTC,"To add to /u/rudolfs001's awesome answer and explain what you do with that measurement ability, this thing is on most aircraft, from your uncle's Cessna on up, and is the input to the pitot static system. The key measurements you get from the pitot static system (the other half of which is a hole somewhere on the aircraft for measuring ambient pressure) are airspeed, altitude, and rate of change in altitude. These manifest on an airspeed indicator, an altimeter, and a variometer. That's about half of the primary instrumentation to drive an airplane.  In this picture, they're top left, top right, and lower right. Not from a MiG 29, but this is what most look like (I imagine the MiG's is electronic and on displays with backups that look like these).  http://i.imgur.com/wEULe44.jpg  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitot-static_system"
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,lachryma,2,Thu Oct 30 06:59:57 2014 UTC,"It is pronounced pee-toh. Also, it is the intake for the airspeed system. That is the extent of my knowledge."
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,card797,4,Thu Oct 30 02:01:33 2014 UTC,IIRC the pitot tube measures your total pressure (dynamic pressure + static) then you subtract the static pressure you get from your static ports and you end up with dynamic pressure which is converted to airspeed.
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,mjbaker474,1 point,Thu Oct 30 02:56:05 2014 UTC,"Actually, the pitot tube measures both pressures and reads out the dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure is useful because it is equal to 1/2 x density x velocity2.  The tip has a small hole, and so long as the tip is pointed into the flow, there will be a point of zero velocity (stagnation point) which will produce a higher pressure (total pressure). The holes on the side are perpendicular to the flow direction, therefore, they will only measure the fluid static pressure."
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,Doublerob7,2,Thu Oct 30 06:01:53 2014 UTC,I assume density is estimated by barometer + thermometer?
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,XNormal,2,Thu Oct 30 06:54:45 2014 UTC,Altitude. There are approximately gradient regions in the atmosphere and two approximately constant regions w.r.t. temperature. Density is derived from ideal gas law.
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,mckrayjones,2,Thu Oct 30 15:43:47 2014 UTC,"If I understand your answer correctly, no thermometer is required because the atmospheric model is enough to estimate temperature by altitude (pressure).  I assume this is slightly less accurate but more reliable than adding more failure modes."
MachinePorn,2kpyzg,XNormal,2,Sun Nov 2 08:58:05 2014 UTC,It's accurate enough for almost all flight envelopes. The math model that helps you approximate the temperature as function of altitude is what drew this graphic.

Funny enough, we were always taught via pass-down info that torpedoes have 'counter-rotating' screws. Which now reading the description of both, is not correct.

Then there was the Tu85 prototype which was an improvement of the Tu80 again based on a Tu4 fuselage.

MachinePorn,2kiqsg,fernguts,6,Tue Oct 28 06:39:20 2014 UTC,"It's just a thought but could some of the extreme noise be attributed to the fact that both props on each engine have the same number of blades? In effect, the thrust from each blade of the forward prop will be interfering with the after prop blades.  I've seen boats with contra rotating propellers and usually one prop has 4 blades while the other has 3 or 5. This reduces the amount of resonance noise and vibration."

They came out within months of each other.  EDIT:   The big problem for Tupolev was the engine choice: the Tu-4 showed that piston engines were not powerful enough to fulfill that role, while the fuel-hungry AM-3 jet engines of the proposed T-4 intercontinental jet bomber did not provide adequate range.[4] Turboprops offered more power than the piston engines and better range than jets available for the new bomber's development at the time, while offering a top speed in between these two alternative choices.   It has a range twice that of a B-52."
MachinePorn,2kiqsg,Viper007Bond,7,Tue Oct 28 09:14:08 2014 UTC,"It has a range twice that of a B-52.   Not at all.  Depending on the versions, the b-52 has an extra 1000 miles more range averaging between 8000 for the bear and 9000 for the b-52.  The Boeing bomber also has a ~50000lb advantage which helps with extra fuel carrying capacity."

MachinePorn,2kiyjl,oldaccount,2,Tue Oct 28 21:48:01 2014 UTC,Cool. So it is 100% manual? Could a person ride it by pulling their own weight?
MachinePorn,2kiyjl,SicilSlovak,1 point,Tue Oct 28 21:51:10 2014 UTC,"It is 100% manual.  I'm not sure if I completely understand the second question, but I've ridden it up and down before, but as you can see in this picture, the rope you need to pull hangs too high from the basement to use it comfortably. It's much more efficient to use it from the upper level.   The brake pulleys do hang down low enough in the basement to use them."
MachinePorn,2kiyjl,ZeosPantera,2,Tue Oct 28 21:56:58 2014 UTC,I was just wondering if you can stand on the elevator and easily pull yourself up. I guess the short rope ensures no one will try.

MachinePorn,2kejxx,Triviaandwordplay,3,Mon Oct 27 04:28:41 2014 UTC,"no, machines designed for the 50Hz market have higher power ratings due to the larger blade diameters they can utilize because of the lower blade tip speeds. 50 and 60 Hz machines are designed to run at 3000 and 3600 rpm respectively. A 50Hz machine would have its components overstressed at 3600rom.   These machines are designed with the fluid mechanics of the specific operation speed in mind."

MachinePorn,2kbto4,vw209,1 point,Sun Oct 26 19:34:32 2014 UTC,"there's less air pressure up high so the available power of an engine goes down as altitude increases. Turbos compress the air, giving you more power at higher altitude."

MachinePorn,2k9urq,ZeosPantera,19,Sat Oct 25 13:25:39 2014 UTC,"The banks of the river are really low so they needed the bridge to be high enough to allow ships to go under the bridge, but that would have meant they needed a large ramp on each side of the bridge to get over the river without blocking the ships path.  So they decided to go with this design, they required no extra room for sloped ramps & could enter the bridge from the riverbank on each side.  They also had to go for a bridge instead of a small ferry because at low tide, a ferry couldn't run.

Was the plane's size used as a consideration in its design whatsoever?"
MachinePorn,2k82dk,Dirty_Socks,3,Sat Oct 25 06:59:59 2014 UTC,Slight hangup with that idea.  This is a Saturn I segment.  The I version looks to be a bit more than 10 ft smaller in diameter than the V so that would already put it out of the league of this plane.  It does appear however that it was used with the Gemini project and some smaller parts of the Apollo project.    I dont know enough about the Saturn rockets but I would hazard a guess that things as large as the first stage would be assembled relatively close by the launch facility mostly because of them being difficult to move.

MachinePorn,2k6x6i,desrosiers,2,Fri Oct 24 18:04:37 2014 UTC,"I'm still not clear as to the purpose, why this is the shape it is and why it's so heavy-duty.  Was this designed to be used as a wind tunnel at different atmospheric pressures?  IE, super-low pressure?  Is that why it's so heavy duty?  Why is it shaped like a pill?  Doesn't there need to be a high volume of air in and out being as it is a wind tunnel?"
MachinePorn,2k6x6i,MGStan,10,Fri Oct 24 15:50:22 2014 UTC,"The wiki article OP linked did a good job explaining the purpose:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Density_Tunnel  Essentially, to model the behavior of an aerodynamic object, you don't have to match the size of the object- you don't need a full-scale plane. You can reduce the size of the model, but you have to match what is called the Reynolds Number, which is Re = rho * V * D / mu, where   rho = air density V = air speed D = some characteristic 'size'. Basically can think of it as a scale factor. mu = air viscosity.   So they want to decrease the size of the plane/wing by, say, a factor of 1:10, and be able to make a wind tunnel to model its behavior. Then they have to up rho or V collectively by 10x, or decrease the viscosity by 10x. You can't necessarily change the viscosity of air by that much (warning: assumption), so you increase the pressure (pretty easy), and increase the wind speed (pretty easy). I believe that some tests actually do increase the viscosity by changing the fluid used for tests, i.e., substituting out air for water or glycerin to easily increase the viscosity of the fluid. e.g.  I think one thing you're missing is that it's a closed system. Air doesn't go in and out- they place a scale model inside there, then pressurize the tank to the operating pressure, then use fans/blowers/whatever to create the flow inside the tank.  The reason it's shaped like a pill is that spherical surfaces handle pressure much better than box-like ones."
MachinePorn,2k6x6i,desrosiers,3,Fri Oct 24 16:44:32 2014 UTC,Jumping in here. You also can't always increase the free stream velocity because the various (non-dimensionalized) properties of the wing are functions of Reynolds number and Mach Number (fraction of speed of sound in the medium). This isn't a problem at less than about mach .3 but scaling the velocity of a wing 10x could easy put you over mach 1 and in that regime you will definitely be seeing shock effects.  Scale fluid experiments require matching both Re and Ma often making compromises.
MachinePorn,2k6x6i,DavidPx,1 point,Sat Oct 25 01:55:24 2014 UTC,Very good point and a bad omission on my part.
MachinePorn,2k6x6i,chargen2,8,Sat Oct 25 13:35:38 2014 UTC,I found a photo album on NASA's site that contains a diagram showing how a model airplane would be positioned.

The air is contained within the capsule and circulates outside an interior chamber for the return.  :-D  Thanks DavidPx!"
MachinePorn,2k6x6i,Socky_McPuppet,6,Fri Oct 24 17:51:26 2014 UTC,"It's designed for high pressure. 21 atmospheres is about 300 psi, which is quite high. Rounded surfaces perform better under pressure, as they reduce surface area while maximizing volume.   They use it to create higher viscosity of air so they can match the Reynolds number, which I don't entirely understand. Apparently how fluids or gases flow across in object creates certain patterns or turbulence, and the scale of the object matters. So if you want to test a large object in a small windtunnel you have to build a model and adjust either the density of the air by putting it under pressure, or increase the speed of the air. It is easier to get high pressure air rather high speed air."

Between 1951 and 1954, 6,000 construction workers made it happen building the power development – dam, tunnel, powerhouse, transmission line, smelter, and town. By 1954, Alcan would harness one-half million horsepower of electricity, at great cost.  Every item for camp living and construction had to be transported in – by air, barge, and overland. Fourteen Sikorsky S-55 helicopters were used as workhorses and load carriers during construction and took men and materials to otherwise inaccessible spots. Without these helicopters, Project engineers would not have maintained the construction schedule.  Workers had to endure isolation and hardship. The magnitude and complexity of the “nuts and bolts” was staggering. Parts of it – the smelter’s deep-sea caisson dock, the aluminum transmission tower – were invented for the Project. All were major feats of engineering and construction.  source: http://www.kitimatmuseum.ca/happen-history  other pics http://www.kitimatmuseum.ca/images/BCDC_photos_highres/P00075.jpg http://www.kitimatmuseum.ca/images/BCDC_photos_highres/P00046.jpg http://www.kitimatmuseum.ca/images/BCDC_photos_highres/P00023.jpg http://www.kitimatmuseum.ca/images/BCDC_photos_highres/P00025.jpg http://www.kitimatmuseum.ca/images/BCDC_photos_highres/P00036.jpg http://www.kitimatmuseum.ca/images/BCDC_photos_highres/P00050.jpg http://www.kitimatmuseum.ca/images/BCDC_photos_highres/P00048.jpg http://www.kitimatmuseum.ca/images/BCDC_photos_highres/P00063.jpg"

That and they were correct that dive bombing was the only way to achieve meaningful accuracy at that time. They never embraced carpet bombing mostly due to the lack of sufficient forces and material to carry out such indiscriminate bombing campaigns.
MachinePorn,2jxzhb,plaidzebra,11,Wed Oct 22 21:13:32 2014 UTC,"There would seem to be three problems with this. Firstly, lack of control authority until flying speed is achieved. I'd wonder how well it coped with side winds and wind shear. Secondly, you have to get the aircraft to the launch site by road. There's no way for it to land at the site. Thirdly although the Soviets could not hit all the launch sites, they could much more easily take out the landing sites. The second and third points make this essentially a one-shot weapon.  The Harrier was developed to address these problems. It has reactive control which works down to zero air speed, and can land on site. However it has always had problems doing a vertical take-off with a full fuel and weapons load, and in practice is always used as STOVL - short take-off, vertical landing - or as STOL. I wonder if anyone looked at combining the systems - RATOG strapped to a Harrier to allow a full-weight zero length take-off?"

The clamp itself is for adding/removing drill rods during operation. its different to the style im familiar with, but Im fairly sure it works on the same principal: 2 clamps, bottom holds last rod in place while new one is threaded on/off, top one is either; (in this case it appears) a clamp for the section of white thing in the picture (a style of support I think) or on a hydraulic swivel to grip and tighten/loosen the last rod on/off.  Apart from this, its fairly barebones, it seems to be manually operated hydraulics and nothing else.

MachinePorn,2jsle0,Palivizumab,11,Mon Oct 20 19:26:08 2014 UTC,"The inertia of spinning objects is really weird. The best IRL example of this is a motorcycle wheel. When you want to turn the wheel to, say, the left, you push it to the right. Pushing it to the right causes all the momentum of the wheel to tilt it back to the left and also sideways.   It's a very hard force to explain because it's a very hard force to understand. People at NASA didn't really know about it until fighter jets like this one had terrible problems.   Basically, someone would roll the jet, and then the jet would violently flip upwards and sideways. It's the same principle of the motorcycle wheel. The rapidly spinning jet would have rotational momentum, and a little bit of air current would be pushing it up.  But because of rotational momentum, that would cause it to spin outward and sideways too. Though a normal plane doesn't feel this force very much, this plane is extremely tail-heavy, which means the plane rotates about its center of mass (about 5 feet forwards of the back end).   Now imagine that, every time you roll the plane, it suddenly violently jerks to the left and upward, and the whole front of the plane is pointing upwards and also spinning, all this while hurtling through the air at 500 mph.   Bad day."
MachinePorn,2jsle0,Dirty_Socks,10,Mon Oct 20 20:22:48 2014 UTC,"People at NASA didn't really know about it until fighter jets like this one had terrible problems.   The Explorer 1 satellite completed its mission despite unexpectedly tumbling end-over-end.  From Wikipedia:   The elongated body of the spacecraft had been designed to spin about its long (least-inertia) axis but refused to do so, and instead started precessing due to energy dissipation from flexible structural elements. Later it was understood that on general grounds, the body ends up in the spin state that minimizes the kinetic rotational energy for a fixed angular momentum (this being the maximal-inertia axis). This motivated the first further development of the Eulerian theory of rigid body dynamics after nearly 200 years—to address this kind of momentum-preserving energy dissipation.   Conservation (and non-conservation) of momenta can be fun. The same sort of interactions are why natural satellites like the moon, which are naturally squishy, tend to spin more slowly over time while gradually orbiting more distant from their parent body."

MachinePorn,2jsle0,HAL-42b,7,Mon Oct 20 19:13:57 2014 UTC,"April 1, 1954) This NACA High-Speed Flight Station photograph shows a side-view of the X-3 Stiletto research aircraft on the ramp at Edwards Air Force Base in 1954. The X-3 Stiletto was a single-place jet aircraft with a slender fuselage and a long tapered nose, manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company. The X-3's primary mission was to investigate the design features of an aircraft suitable for sustained supersonic speeds, which included the first use of titanium in major airframe components. It was delivered to the NACA High-Speed Flight Station in August of 1954 after some Douglas and Air Force evaluation testing. The Douglas X-3, known as the Stiletto, was built to investigate the design of an aircraft suitable for sustained supersonic speeds. The X-3 was intended for sustained flight research above Mach 2, but was hampered by use of underpowered Westinghouse J34 turbojet engines which could not power the aircraft past Mach 1 in level flight. This aircraft was built by the Douglas Aircraft Company. The X-3 had, perhaps, the most highly refined supersonic airframe of its day as well as other important advances including one of the first machined structures. It included the first use of titanium in major airframe components. Its long fuselage gave the Stiletto a high-fineness ratio and a low-aspect ratio (the ratio of the wing's span to its chord; in other words, it was short and stubby). Despite this refined configuration, the maximum speed it attained was Mach 1.21, during a dive. The general consensus was that the aircraft was sluggish and extremely underpowered. The X-3 also demonstrated coupling instability during abrupt rolling maneuvers, which could cause it to go wildly out of control, as happened on a flight on October 27, 1954, with National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) pilot Joe Walker at the controls. The principle contribution of the X-3 was its data on inertial coupling (roll divergence)--a tendency to diverge from the intended flight path. The aircraft also shed its small tires routinely, leading to a revision of the design criteria for tires used on high-speed aircraft. This aircraft flew 20 times between 1954 and 1956 at the NACA High-Speed Flight Station (predecessor of NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California). Joe Walker was the pilot for all 20 of these missions. The X-3's first flight was in October 1952 with Douglas test pilot Bill Bridgeman in the cockpit. The Air Force completed a brief evaluation of the airplane in 1953 and 1954 before turning it over to the NACA in the summer of 1954."

They were exceeded in length, displacement, and cargo mass by the former Seawise Giant, and they are currently exceeded in displacement, and cargo mass by the TI class supertankers.    From the wikipedia page."
MachinePorn,2joxm4,zynix,6,Sun Oct 19 23:36:42 2014 UTC,"I thought modern freighters followed in similar fashion to diesel train engines ( The diesel engines are hooked up to dynamo's which power an electric motor ).  For trains, electric motors have better torque and for ships they can stack everything on top of each other for a much smaller foot space requirement.    In the picture essay linked by /u/nawitus, the dynamo's and electric motor seem absent.  edit:   One of the class's main design features is its dual 32-megawatt (43,000 hp) ultra-long stroke two-stroke diesel engines, driving two propellers at a design speed of 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph). Slower than its predecessors, this class uses a strategy known as slow steaming, which is expected to lower fuel consumption by 37% and carbon dioxide emissions per container by 50%. The Triple E design helped Maersk win a ""Sustainable Ship Operator of the Year"" award in July 2011. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maersk_Triple_E_class   Apparently direct drive systems with no intermediate dynamo to electric."
MachinePorn,2joxm4,Ileach,6,Sun Oct 19 22:57:00 2014 UTC,Direct drive is still the most efficient propulsion method. Even the most advanced high voltage diesel-electric systems are not as efficient as a direct drive setup.
MachinePorn,2joxm4,RockYourOwnium,5,Mon Oct 20 06:33:16 2014 UTC,"As far as efficiency goes, would you agree that nuclear power is the real winner? Why or why not?   I'm asking that in all sincerity."
MachinePorn,2joxm4,Ileach,3,Mon Oct 20 07:27:43 2014 UTC,"I'm a marine engineer. My licence only covers me for diesel propulsion, so I'd be out of a job.  Seriously though, I would imagine that guys working on nuclear plant would require much more training, vetting and certification. I also think that there would be a requirement for a much larger crew as well as security contingencies.  Engine room crew on diesel ships such as there can consist of a relatively small number of people. One vessel I was on, with a similar setup to these container vessels, had a Chief, second, third and fourth engineer, one electrician, a motorman and a mechanic. That was it. Quite a small crew for a large engine room."
MachinePorn,2joxm4,vonHindenburg,3,Mon Oct 20 07:39:52 2014 UTC,"Well, you’re mixing questions of two different aspects of efficiency here:  Power source efficiency and drive train efficiency.  Whether a ship is powered by steam, (generated either from the burning of fuel oil or the ‘burning’ of uranium in a reactor), or by an internal combustion engine burning either bunker fuel or diesel, or even by a gas turbine, this is a choice independent from the type of drive train that hooks that engine to the prop.  Any of these can be hooked by direct drive to a propeller, run through a mechanical gearbox, or be hooked to an electric generator that powers electric motors, which actually turn the screws.    In terms of raw, mechanical efficiency in moving power from the engine to the prop, a direct drive is always best.  However, there are mitigating circumstances.  Engines may run at their most economical speed at RPM’s far in excess of what you want the prop spinning at.  (This is especially true of gas and steam turbines).  Therefore, they can be run through reduction gears that reduce the speed of the engine to that needed by the screws.    Finally, even though it’s slightly less efficient, there are benefits to electric drive.  Specifically, it allows for more flexibility.  With a mechanical connection between the engine and prop, you have to place everything in very specific spots so that it all lines up.  You’re also faced with the decision between locating the engines, which are one of the heaviest components of the ship, near the stern (and requiring some counterbalance to maintain trim), or having a big, honkin’ tunnel carved out of your cargo/fuel/ballast space to carry the drive shaft from the ship’s center of gravity all the way to the stern.  Types of cargo or specific docking facilities can also affect the decision of engine placement.  Electric drive allows you to put your primary power plant anywhere in the ship and then run that power by smaller, flexible cables to the relatively small electric motors near the props.  This even allows for more exotic styles of propulsion such as azipods where an electric motor is slung in a small pod with a propeller under the ship.  This pod can rotate 360 degrees to provide greater maneuverability.  In terms of your question about the economic efficiency of nuke-powered cargo carriers, a person connected with the design of the EEE did an AMA a few months ago wherein he said that, yes, we’ve passed the point where nuclear would be cheaper.  However, many cities and countries will not allow nuke boats to dock, thus greatly limiting their capabilities.  I’ve seen this claim elsewhere.  In naval design, the very rough rule of thumb is that nuclear is cheaper over the life of the ship over 40,000 tons.  This limit would be higher for a merchant vessel, but we’ve still surpassed it by a large margin."
MachinePorn,2joxm4,AyCarrumba,2,Mon Oct 20 12:10:50 2014 UTC,"It's also a space issue. Nuclear reactors are huge, and over-powered for a ship which does not need high speed or manouverability, just incredible efficiency. A diesel takes less room, less running, and less maintenance, which means more cargo and ultimately more profit."
MachinePorn,2joxm4,randomfact8472,1 point,Mon Oct 20 12:09:17 2014 UTC,It would be cheaper in the long run. It would actually be smaller. Reactor from a nuclear sub would be big enough.   Proliferation/licensing and port of entry concerns prevent nuclear from being popular for large civilian vessels.
MachinePorn,2joxm4,AyCarrumba,1 point,Thu Oct 23 20:33:16 2014 UTC,"I really don't think it would. You've got the costs of the Reactor itself, which aren't cheap. They aren't smaller than even a big diesel engine room, even when fuel is taken into consideration - they fit in subs and large warships because they don't NEED a lot of cargo space. Then you need specialist crew to maintain and run a reactor safely - fine on a military ship with a large crew, problematic on a ship which will run with as few as a dozen men. Then all the logistical problems of servicing, fuel procurement, etc, none of which there is civilian capacity for.  The liabilities involved can be considered 'costs', and lets face it, if it worked out cheaper, they would already be doing it."
MachinePorn,2joxm4,biosloth,2,Fri Oct 24 00:32:19 2014 UTC,Plus nuclear propulsion is seriously fuck out expensive.  And nuclear power plants aren't allowed in many ports.
MachinePorn,2joxm4,zynix,3,Mon Oct 20 18:34:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I found too.  Started digging into diesel-electric wiki & publications, for trains it makes a lot more sense due to torque.  With larger ships, and especially the Maersk, the space savings from diesel-electric wouldn't be enough to justify a 7-9% efficiency loss over the life of the ship."
MachinePorn,2joxm4,Ileach,3,Mon Oct 20 06:44:23 2014 UTC,"It's also much easier to maintain. Some vessels like these do have shaft alternators/generators but these just provide power to the rest of the vessel, nothing to do with propulsive power. They allow the much smaller diesel generators to be shut down while the vessel is on passage. I'm not sure if these vessels are equipped with them though."

MachinePorn,2jirkw,caskey,1 point,Sat Oct 18 02:31:09 2014 UTC,"I think you mean frequency (wavelength) but all of wavelength, source signal strength and need for precise directionality can affect dish size.  E.g., DVB-S satellite TV broadcast (big dish kind) occurs from a series of satellites that are only 2 degrees  apart in the sky and so you still need a large dish to focus the aim point and avoid picking up signals from nearby transponders.   DBS is the newer small dish satellite services."
MachinePorn,2jirkw,HawkUK,1 point,Sat Oct 18 02:56:13 2014 UTC,"While I have no idea about military use, in the commercial world the tendency has been to move to shorter and shorter wavelengths which can carry more data. Smaller dishes are used these days."
MachinePorn,2jirkw,vodenii,1 point,Sat Oct 18 09:42:52 2014 UTC,So it's wavelength that determines dish diameter?
MachinePorn,2jirkw,HawkUK,2,Sat Oct 18 14:58:50 2014 UTC,"Pretty much. The longer the wavelength, the greater the tendency of the signal to diffract. With a C-band transmission you're usually going to want a bigger dish to reduce that diffraction than if you were using Ku band. IIRC the diffraction is proportional to [wavelength]/[dish diameter].  However, satellites are more powerful now, so all antennas on the ground are smaller than they used to be."

MachinePorn,2jirkw,ctesibius,5,Fri Oct 17 17:30:40 2014 UTC,"Dodging and burning are photographic terms. As I understand it, burning is selective over-exposure of part of the image when you make the print, and dodging is the reverse."
MachinePorn,2jirkw,badaimarcher,3,Fri Oct 17 18:10:30 2014 UTC,"Correct. When creating a print, a negative is projected onto photosensitive paper for a given amount of time.  The more light you allow to reach the paper, the darker the print will be. Now, you can allow the entire negative to be projected onto the paper, or you can block some of the light by cutting a hole in a piece of paper and projecting certain areas of the negative for longer amounts of time (ie darker).  You can see in the picture above how this technique was applied to ""burn in"" the lighter areas around the dome and bow, while creating a halo effect behind the ship by underexposing and blocking those areas of the negative."

MachinePorn,2jc7vb,RyanSmith,13,Wed Oct 15 18:10:33 2014 UTC,"Kiwi-A Prime is one of a series of atomic reactors for studying the feasibility of nuclear rocket propulsion, in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Developed by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the reactor underwent a highly successful full-power run on July 8, 1960, at Nevada Test Site in Jackass Flats, Nevada. Kiwi was a project under the National Nuclear Rocket development program, sponsored jointly by Atomic Energy Commission and NASA as part of project Rover/NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application). The main objective of Rover/NERVA was to design a flight rated thermodynamic nuclear rocket engine. Kiwi was a prototype for a nuclear rocket reactor that could be used in space travel. Gaseous hydrogen was used as a propellant on the Kiwi-A tests that began in 1959. Kiwi-A served as a learning tool to test specifications and to discover changes that needed to be implemented in the next phase of study, the Kiwi-B series. This project began in December 1961 and used liquid hydrogen as a propellant. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, the Nixon Administration cut NASA and NERVA funding dramatically. The cutbacks were made in response to a lack of public interest in human spaceflight, the end of the space race after the Apollo Moon landing, and the growing use of low-cost unmanned, robotic space probes. Eventually NERVA lost its funding, and the project ended in 1973."

He filed a patent for the stepped drum mechanism that allowed the calculator to fit into such a small package in 1938. In 1943, he was interned in a Nazi concentration camp. Up until then, he had not completed any design work on what would be known as the Curta. While in the concentration camp, he talked to the camp's leaders about his idea for a handheld calculation machine. The Nazis recognized the potential such a machine could have in helping Germany win the war and allowed him to work on designing and manufacturing the device. This saved Curt's life. After the war, Curt founded the Contina AG Mauren company to manufacture the calculators. Until the advent of electronic calculators in the 1970's, the Curta was widely considered the best portable calculator available.   This is how they work."

Most of them were based on the very simple principle of an Odhner Pinwheel, a gear with a variable number of teeth.  Here is a nice demonstration."

In case someone is wondering, that's a special ship used only for that specific task. For almost any other use, a ship of that size would be more efficient with a single hull."
MachinePorn,2j7hr3,Doormatty,5,Tue Oct 14 21:10:02 2014 UTC,a ship of that size would be more efficient with a single hull.   Why's that?
MachinePorn,2j7hr3,MasterFubar,7,Wed Oct 15 01:56:06 2014 UTC,Because with two hulls the waves impose different forces on both of them. Those forces tend to separate the hulls. You need a strong structure to hold them together. That structure is dead weight. It's contributing nothing but the force that keeps both hulls together. With a single hull you don't need to carry that dead weight around.

However I may imagine that they could have been kept idling and percolating while not in use on a constant rotational basis.  There are steam engines with quickly and automatically starting boilers, like the Doble steam car. This however requires a flash boiler (low water volume, usually a coiled copper tube), and a liquid/gas fuel burner."

MachinePorn,2irrc1,bradhuds,15,Thu Oct 9 17:45:16 2014 UTC,"Ok seriously though, what is the aluminum foil (or whatever it actually is) for?"
MachinePorn,2irrc1,XenoRyet,26,Thu Oct 9 18:32:55 2014 UTC,"Ok seriously though, what is the aluminum foil (or whatever it actually is) for?   You cover it in aluminum foil when you're going to heat the chamber while evacuating it. This is done after pressurizing it, e.g. opening it and letting in ambient air.  Ambient air contains water and the water prevents you from reaching ultra-high vacuum (UHV). The fastest and best way to get rid of the water is to heat the chamber. And the aluminum foil helps distributing the heat of the electric heating wires as well as providing some insulation to keep the heat on the chamber.  Trivia: Scientific aluminum foil is thicker than normal housefold foil and costs several hundred times more. One roll of laboratory aluminum foil can costs $200-300 which is why many laboratories often resort to household foil with the drawback that the household foil tends to tear much easier. But many scientists rather deal with foil tearing than paying for overpriced laboratory aluminum foil."
MachinePorn,2irrc1,cbmuser,13,Thu Oct 9 21:47:02 2014 UTC,Another important drawback of household foil is that it is often coated with a thin layer of oil on one or both sides and this oil tends to have a fairly high molecular weight making it a pretty detrimental impurity if it somehow makes it into the vacuum envelope. Since foil is often used as a substrate for laying out vacuum components for cleaning the household stuff can get you into a lot of trouble with contamination and achieving ultra high vacuum.
MachinePorn,2irrc1,saprophyte,5,Thu Oct 9 22:15:53 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure those huge tools we used when I worked in the dining halls at my college didnt have any coating.
MachinePorn,2irrc1,RexFox,1 point,Thu Oct 9 23:34:14 2014 UTC,That is entirely possible. Typically the obvious giveaway is that one side seems to have more of a sheen than the other.
MachinePorn,2irrc1,saprophyte,12,Thu Oct 9 23:42:40 2014 UTC,"I recently learned that the difference in sides is due to the manufacturing process. The foil is so thin that they have to roll two sheets at the same time, thus the shiny side is created by the rollers, and the matte side is from where the two sheets were together.   Here's the wiki."
MachinePorn,2irrc1,KargBartok,2,Fri Oct 10 02:16:19 2014 UTC,That would make sense as a thin layer of oil would help in subsequently separating the sheets. I also do seem to recall being told the matte side is the oily one.
MachinePorn,2irrc1,saprophyte,1 point,Fri Oct 10 05:11:03 2014 UTC,"Scientific aluminum foil is also sold by companies like Fisher, VWR, and the like who bend you over the barrel every chance they get. Literally every non-science product they sell is marked up at least 2x the price elsewhere."
MachinePorn,2irrc1,UROBONAR,11,Tue Oct 21 04:52:56 2014 UTC,"On/near parts that get cold, it can help prevent condensation. So, insulation."
MachinePorn,2irrc1,Kevindeuxieme,6,Thu Oct 9 19:05:35 2014 UTC,"To add to this a little: it's not the foil so much as the air, because if you have a few layers of crumpled up foil you end up trapping layers/pockets of air and this is what allows you to have larger thermal gradients (ie have a good insulator)"

This whole thing isn't actually the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) but a complete UHV chamber with pumps, various detectors and an STM.  The actual STM is very small and basically consists of a piece of platinum wire which is attached to piezo and precision servo actuators. The wire is sharpened on the sample side and hovers over the sample at a distance of just a few nanometers.  Wire and sample (which has to be conductive) are connected to a high-sensitivity amplifier which feeds into a DAC and eventually a computer which also control the actuators rastering across the sample. The computer calculates a topography from the scanned surface of the sample."

MachinePorn,2io9bg,oldaccount,3,Wed Oct 8 23:01:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah, from what I've heard this is just about the largest issue with this design. Many parts of it are less complex than a normal ICE, but having those rotating seals is going to be a problem, they're going to wear out fast"
MachinePorn,2io9bg,THE_CENTURION,7,Wed Oct 8 23:33:36 2014 UTC,This kind of setup works well for creating high-pressure waterjets (as an example).  The rotary motion from the input shaft from an electric motor drives pistons up and down and with an appropriately strong casing/valves can produce fine streams of very high pressure.
MachinePorn,2io9bg,0xD153A53,2,Wed Oct 8 19:04:27 2014 UTC,So the power would come in the top shaft? I was under the impression that the pistons were doing the work and thus turning the the output shaft on top. Maybe I completely misinterpreted the design.
MachinePorn,2io9bg,oldaccount,7,Wed Oct 8 19:45:28 2014 UTC,It can be either.
MachinePorn,2io9bg,ctesibius,2,Wed Oct 8 20:49:41 2014 UTC,"That's entirely possible, too.  The reciprocating motion of the pistons can be used to create the rotational motion of the output shaft.  However, the process can be just as easily reversed, depending on the application."

MachinePorn,2io9bg,PrimeLegionnaire,14,Wed Oct 8 17:34:47 2014 UTC,"no, its not.  Axial engines and pumps have existed for over a century.  They are large, inefficient, and become dirty and break.  The ""argument"" for them being more efficient is that they have fewer parts and less friction, and in practice it is not true.  The device is very difficult to lubricate.  There are also several other reasons its less efficient- bad valve timing and high leakage being to large ones.  They vibrate a huge amount and are much louder than conventional engines."

MachinePorn,2io9bg,PrimeLegionnaire,0,Wed Oct 8 21:32:57 2014 UTC,"It definitely doesn't.  Its hundred year old technology and it isn't any better now than it was then just because a company says it is.  It is a basic mathematical fact that it will be louder, and it is a fact of engineering that it will be less efficient."
MachinePorn,2io9bg,hwillis,2,Wed Oct 8 22:54:42 2014 UTC,"I'm with you on this one. Compared to traditional swash plate engine, that design has the ""advantage"" of rotating the cylinders around the shaft. More moving mass anyone?  That should mean less efficiency and less responsiveness to throttle. And it requires larger counterweight. And as the ports are fixed to the frame, it also can open those ports as fast as the heavy cylinder moves to position. Light weight poppet valves should give you more time with port fully open. Hence better efficiency.  So the only real advantage seems to be less spark plugs.. But they wear faster because they need to do some ignition for every of those pistons. So you get to change spark plugs more often!  This ""less moving parts"" is becoming a plague of mechanical engineering."
MachinePorn,2io9bg,jokoon,-1,Thu Oct 9 14:06:22 2014 UTC,more efficient   where did you read that ? who told you that ?  it's crazy that even in science and engineering there are myths.

MachinePorn,2io9bg,ABusFullaJewz,8,Wed Oct 8 20:52:21 2014 UTC,"Cool concept, but what is this actually good for other than having lots of bearing surfaces and stress risers? Looks like it would only work in a sort of high rpm, low torque, really low load scenario."
MachinePorn,2io9bg,FrenchFryCattaneo,6,Wed Oct 8 19:00:39 2014 UTC,"This design is how most air conditioning compressors in cars work. It's called a swash plate compressor. Here is a picture of one I have apart right now, you can see the pistons connected with ball joints. The whole thing is driven with this wedge shaped piece which is connected to the input pulley."
MachinePorn,2io9bg,0xD153A53,4,Wed Oct 8 22:07:15 2014 UTC,"Reverse the process:  Rotary motion from an electric motor turns the swashplate, causing pistons to rise and fall.  Now, provide a water inlet to each piston, with a strong valve at the base of each piston into a pressure vessel.  As the swashplate turns, water is pressurized in the vessel, and with a suitably strong output valve/narrow nozzle, can produce ridiculously high pressures of fluid for, say, cutting, washing, etc.  Can also be applied to high-pressure hydraulic systems for lifting, etc."
MachinePorn,2io9bg,ABusFullaJewz,2,Wed Oct 8 19:06:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah I could definitely see that working. The more I thought about it I realized that as a combustion engine it doesn't really work since it'd need to either be 2 stroke or stagger the firing order, but then runs just like a 2 or 4 stroke 4 cylinder and it's nothing more than a fancy alternative to a crankshaft.   As a pump though it makes sense cause each compression stroke is actually moving fluid, not every second stroke. Wouldn't it be ill-suited for pressure though cause of the flimsy design and more appropriate for volume?"

I mean, we're at 12/14nm currently and the size shrinks so quickly (relatively speaking) that we're bound to be butting up against the constraints of the laws of physics rather soon, right?"
MachinePorn,2ikxq4,driscoll42,7,Tue Oct 7 22:47:36 2014 UTC,"The goal is to hit 5 nanometers by 2020. As for smaller:   Continuing the pattern of halving the surface area of each node (or reducing the square sides by 1.4) every two years, it can be expected that 4 nm technology will appear in roughly 2022, 3 nm in 2024, 2 nm in 2026, and lastly 1 nm in 2028, which may be the limit for current lithographic semiconductor silicon technology as presently implemented. As a result 2030 and beyond may see a shift in technology to enable smaller components in the form of silicene or silicon nanotubes."

MachinePorn,2ikxq4,Cannibalsnail,2,Wed Oct 8 19:14:54 2014 UTC,Even e-beam lithography is hard to scale due to the need to reposition the beam or the photoresist. X-Ray would be extremely inefficient. I expect to see some sort of nanoscience based development before then.

MachinePorn,2ikxq4,spiker611,4,Wed Oct 8 17:43:06 2014 UTC,"The ""nm"" number isn't so accurate anymore.  There are many other measurments that matter.    The first point to make is that the process name is “14nm” as opposed to the “22nm” process that preceded it. What are those numbers? In the past they referred to minimum drawable feature size but that world is long gone, Intel says it hasn’t been the case since the 90nm days or so. If the nm in the name does not refer to a physical dimension, what does it refer to?  Process naming is and has been for quite a while a reference to the shrink factor of the new node compared to its predecessor. In short this means if a 130nm process has a minimum drawn feature size of 130nm and a cell size of X, a shrink is going to be half the cell size. This means a 90nm process should have a feature size of 90nm and a cell size of X/2.   http://semiaccurate.com/2014/08/11/intel-talks-14nm-process/  EDIT: In response to your question, I'm convinced that the future is die stacking.

MachinePorn,2ikxq4,Hexorg,3,Fri Oct 10 21:48:22 2014 UTC,There's a limit as we reach one angstrum (1A = 0.1nm). That's a size of a phosphorus atom. Can't go smaller then that since phosphorus is a dopant used on a silicone die. But perhaps by then we'll have quantum computers of sorts.

MachinePorn,2ikxq4,gadorp,4,Tue Oct 7 22:56:52 2014 UTC,The size of the die/litho process hasn't had anything to do with clock speed for over a decade. Intel released their 3GHz P4 in 2002 (iirc) and we're still hovering right around there for the average mid-high CPU. The i5-4590 I just bought sits right around 3GHz normally.
MachinePorn,2ikxq4,eskimopussy,6,Tue Oct 7 23:01:13 2014 UTC,"You're right, die/litho process hasn't given us faster clock speeds, but it's the reason the i5 destroys the P4. It's the result of a smaller process that allows for more circuitry on the die and more/better logic. But now this is kind of circling back to your original question, what happens when we can't make things smaller.  I think the point I was trying to make is that we are going to be coming up with novel solutions that don't involve just making things smaller, just like we've been coming up with solutions that don't involve increasing clock speed. What those solutions are, I do not know, which is why I said I'm curious to learn more. So, frankly, I'm out of my element and will now shut the fuck up."
MachinePorn,2ikxq4,lvl7hound,2,Wed Oct 8 01:17:45 2014 UTC,"Semiconductor fabrication isn't my area of expertise, but I remember studying a bit about materials, such as gallium arsenide, that had certain advantages over silicon. Do you know if alternative semiconductors like this have any realistic potential for the advancement of computers in the future?"
MachinePorn,2ikxq4,theholyraptor,6,Wed Oct 8 00:13:35 2014 UTC,"Yes and no.  Right now silicon is king for mass market semiconductors, and will probably remain so until it is no longer economical to do so.  Silicon itself is cheap to manufacture compared to other components on a per part basis, so even though modern fabs are whopping expensive (TSMC is paying for a 9.3 billion dollar fabrication plant in Taiwan), most of that cost is offset by the large amounts of cheap products you can manufacture.  Materials like Gallium Arsenide offer numerous advantages over silicon, such as higher electron mobility and wider bandgap.  Indeed it has found a niche as a material of choice for microwave circuits and may power the amplifier chips in your cell phone.  However it's not all rosey.  Gallium Arsenide is difficult to create fast P-channel FETs on due to low hole mobility, which are required for CMOS circuits.  That limits Gallium Arsenide to high power applications compared to Silicon, in which CMOS structures are very much commonplace.   Gallium Arsenide does not have a 'native oxide' like Silicon, so it's difficult to grow insulating layers on integrated circuits like Silicon.  Silicon has Silicon Dioxide as a 'native oxide layer', which is basically glass, making it really easy to grow an oxide layer on a silicon part to insulate and protect the IC.  Gallium Nitride is an up-and-coming material that has some promise for displacing silicon, especially in power electronics and microwave applications.  Gallium Nitride has a very high breakdown resilience to strong electric fields, high electron density, good electron mobility, and high saturated electron speed.  It can also be grown on top of a Silicon substrate, meaning it can be processed similar to silicon devices.  I haven't heard much about GaN for digital integrated circuits, though I don't see why it wouldn't be a possibility.  http://www.rfglobalnet.com/doc/gan-the-technology-of-the-future-0001  EDIT: My understanding is Gallium Nitride processing is what the recent Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for, which led to the creation of Blue LEDs.  As a semiconductor material it's being used for much more than Blue LEDs these days.  The most likely candidate for replacing silicon integrated circuits in the near future for computing is probably graphene, though I have it on the authority of a former college professor of mine they have lots of problems to work out before they are remotely ready.  It has excellent mechanical and thermal properties, and its electrical properties are tantalizingly good (high carrier mobility).  It has been explored as a medium for integrated circuits at length, and at least IBM considers it worthy of a very substantial capital investment."

MachinePorn,2ifw43,sebwiers,20,Mon Oct 6 14:26:36 2014 UTC,"The steering angle isn't vertical.  Its a girder fork.    The shape / angle of the upright that supports the wheels can be fairly arbitrary, and since it needs to run from the forward pivots down to the wheel, tends to be vertical.  The important angle to consider is the one formed by the line through the headset to the front axle, which is quite conventional.  In fact, Magpul INCREASED the trail (the distance between where the above line would touch the ground, and the point directly below the axle)  by 13mm, which would tend to make the bike MORE stable at high speed (but perhaps less responsive to steering input)."
MachinePorn,2ifw43,tomparker,3,Mon Oct 6 16:02:47 2014 UTC,It's likely the correct rake. Some recent hot mods have extended the rake which would probably make anything but straight-line riding treacherous.
MachinePorn,2ifw43,chrisgedrim,3,Mon Oct 6 14:38:40 2014 UTC,"It's all about 'trail', which I'll attempt explain but if anyone knows better, shout up.  Project a line (A) vertically from the centre of the front axle. Project a line (B) that intersects the rotational centre of the neck. The point at which B touches the ground should ideally be within the range of 4""-6"" forward of the point where A touches the ground."

MachinePorn,2ifw43,sebwiers,2,Mon Oct 6 15:13:40 2014 UTC,Buells have a reputation for being twitchy; they are made for twisty canyon carving and race track riding.  That's probably why Magpull bumped up the trail by 13mm.

If the front end is as light as they say it is (comparable to conventional forks) then you will pay the price in exotic materials.  Having the footpegs cast into the battery box is a bad idea too. Pegs should be designed to snap off before they take the rest of the footrest hanger with them. A lowside on this would mean replacing what looks like a very expensive cast part (and let's not forget the non-adjustability).  Overall it's not my cup of tea but I do admire them for going for it and hope there's enough customers for them to keep going."

MachinePorn,2ifw43,sebwiers,-6,Mon Oct 6 13:38:40 2014 UTC,That design looks so bad. And how come the front disk is so darn huge?
MachinePorn,2ifw43,249ba36000029bbe9749,12,Mon Oct 6 18:49:39 2014 UTC,"how come the front disk is so darn huge?   for two good reasons:  1) Its one disk doing the work that would normally be done by two (dual disks are standard on the fronts of sporting motorcycles).  As such, it needs to have the same mass as two normal sized disks to avoid over heating (since brake rotors absorb kinetic energy as heat, then radiate it as a heat sink).  2) It is bolted to the perimeter of the wheel instead of the hub, so it just makes sense to make it large in diameter (and from there, required mass & swept area dictates width and thickness).  Bolting it to the wheel perimeter means the braking force doesn't pass through the wheel spokes (no torque on the hub) so the wheel itself can be lighter construction, while the rotor is no more massive than typical.  The result is the bike has lower unsprung mass, which is good for handling.    Number 2 is is the reason Buell uses such a design (the bike's wheels and brakes are stock).  There's no point using it in the back, since the wheel is already designed to take the torque from the drive sprocket."
MachinePorn,2ifw43,sebwiers,0,Mon Oct 6 13:10:33 2014 UTC,"As such, it needs to have the same mass as two normal sized disks to avoid over heating (since brake rotors act as heat sinks).   Is it mass or surface area which is the determining factor?"
MachinePorn,2ifw43,DC12V,2,Mon Oct 6 14:09:22 2014 UTC,"Mass is critical in the short term (for a single brief maximum braking effort going into a turn, or fast full stop braking effort) since it determines how much KE the braking system can absorb before getting so hot that the brake fluid boils (or other failure modes occur), assuming there's not time to dump much / any heat into the air.  If you can come up with a design (materials, fluids, etc) that tolerate higher temps, or can absorb more energy without increasing in temp, you can get away with less mass, but mass is a critical factor.  Surface area (and airflow, etc) can be important in the long term (such as a full lap in a race, or a long hill descent), because it determines how fast the brake cools down between max braking efforts.  Various designs (such as internally slotted rotors) used in performance cars aim to increase surface area and air flow without requiring large diameter / multiple rotors, but on a motorcycle just using relatively thin solid rotors is a simple and effective option.  So the answer is both, determining different things, and balanced by what your design priorities are.  Same as any heat sink that deals with transient loads."

MachinePorn,2ib9qz,Mr_Cavendish,19,Sat Oct 4 22:44:55 2014 UTC,Did you know that there is a difference between boring and drilling? Boring is much more accurate and involves feeding a tool bit attached to a boring bar the depth of the hole. The resulting bore can then be measured and the bar moved and run through again until the desired bore size is reached. I highly recommend Ox Tools for anyone who wants to see this kind of stuff in action.
MachinePorn,2ib9qz,Flonkers,2,Sun Oct 5 02:13:52 2014 UTC,"I was going to say, this looks much more like drilling. Boring bits have straight flutes mostly, right?  Edit: I was thinking of a reamer... Thanks everyone!"
MachinePorn,2ib9qz,8Complex,9,Sun Oct 5 02:46:40 2014 UTC,"Boring tools look nothing like drill bits, they don't even operate like them.  They're not even called bits, they're called boring bars. They have a cutting tip on the end of a steel bar, and they cut the inside diameter at a single point as it rotates (drill bits cut at two points). Here's a bit of video showing lathe boring from the (as /u/Flonkers said) fantastic Ox Tools on youtube.  Ninja edit: What you're thinking of is called reaming. A reamer is a drill-bit like tool that, as you say, commonly has straight flutes. But some do have a slight twist. Reamers will enlarge a hole to a precision size and roundness, and leave a very smooth finish. But unlike boring, they won't correct for misalignment. If the drill that made the original hole went crooked, the reamer will go crooked too. Boring will remove the crookedness because it doesn't follow the existing hole."

Also, is there a difference between boring and line boring or is all boring just line boring?"
MachinePorn,2ib9qz,zymase,2,Sun Oct 5 06:01:31 2014 UTC,"I'll pick you out some of my favorite videos from that site if you like,  line boring is when the work is held stationary and a boring bar is held in the lathe chuck at one end and supported in line at the other by a live center and the bar is rotated so that a tool bit cuts away the metal. The tool bit can be adjusted in and out to get a precise bore size.  Also done in the field with a special machine for things like earth movers and cranes. I'll find you my favorite line bore video. Two years ago I started watching this stuff on YouTube, which led more or less directly to studying engineering as a mature age student."
MachinePorn,2ib9qz,Flonkers,1 point,Sun Oct 5 11:33:56 2014 UTC,Here's how line-boring is done in the  field:  And on the lathe:
MachinePorn,2ib9qz,Flonkers,1 point,Mon Oct 6 06:18:38 2014 UTC,"Drilling is normally used for roughing operations, just getting material out. If tolerance is lose and you dont really care where the hole is on the part, you can just drill.   If you care only about the hole size, and the hole is small enough you can use a reamer. Reamers are slightly self aligning,  thats why they are used. They will bend slightly, aligning to the middle of the hole as opposed to the tool holder. You will get a precise hole  and a nice finish.   You use a boring bar when either the hole is too large, or the drawing calls for a hole with a tight roundness tolerance. Because it is a single point, and the part is concentric to the spindle, the bored hole will be concentric to the part."

MachinePorn,2i6qfa,peen_was,15,Sat Oct 4 03:12:01 2014 UTC,"This is the Boeing tour at their assembly plant in Everette Washington. The building is so large in square feet that it can hold Disney Land within its walls.  Parking is an issue as you can imagine.  The tour is so worth it. It's in the Future of Flight facility and is open to the public all year.  The plane that you see there is probably toward the front. There are probably 4 planes or so build on a sort of stop and go assembly line.  Across from this bay are giant pain boths that are equally as not as large but much more impressive from an engineering stand point.  My favorite fact: When being assembled, the engines are put on last and massive weights have to be hung from the wings to prevent the plant from tipping backwards.  This is just assembly of the plane. Boeing fabricates most of the individual part itself through out the country. While this facility is impressive in its size the fabrication process is, IMO, much much more machine porn worthy.   For example, acid baths are used for the  wings that contain 80,000 gallons of fluid. A 3 story, 50 yard x 20 yard autoclave that is used to manufactur composite wing. Milling machine the size of small office building. Ovens the size of 3 story apartment building. Everything is massive."
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,everythingchanges,7,Fri Oct 3 16:24:52 2014 UTC,"The planes won't tip over without the engines, the weights are just to stress the wings in the same way that they'll be stressed when the actual engines are hung, so that all the rigging adjustments won't get thrown out of whack.  And just to add: those green and orange rails on the ceiling support transiting cranes which carry airplane body sections, wings, and other stuff around. The cranes run on track segments (the yellow beams on the left) which run up and down the green & orange rails, and the cranes can run off of one segment and onto the adjacent one, so they can carry a load anywhere in the factory. (Once a plane is assembled it's too heavy for the cranes.)"
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,Neurorational,5,Fri Oct 3 21:11:45 2014 UTC,Correction: For the 787 Boeing does not fabricate most of the parts. Most of the parts are fabricated and assembled in sub-assemblies throughout the world by suppliers and shipped to Boeing via the Dreamlifter.  Only final assembly of the sub-assemblies is done at Boeing facilities.

Everything is massive.    For clarity to everyone else, chem-mill tanks aren't used for composite wings. Aluminum panels, and fueslage skins, expecially. Autoclave dimensions in stories aren't aren't a great description for a circular pressure vessel.  BCA South Carolina's clave is technically the largest in the world right now, if memory serves. Functionally 30' in diameter by about 80' long for 787 barrels. MHI's wing claves are like 24 or so feet in diameter and probably close to 110' long, working size.  Though the clave for 777X wings will have slightly more internal volume than both, though being not as wide SC's. They're welding rings together at Paine Field right now for the future factory.

MachinePorn,2i6qfa,mb79,3,Fri Oct 3 18:02:36 2014 UTC,"Good question.  They were anal to say the least about not having cameras or cell phones when I went on the tour back in July.  Apparently it's due to Boeing's union contract as it would not be in the employees' best interest to be photographed by outsiders while on he job.  Great tour and well worth the time and money, though."
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,PrinceXizor,3,Fri Oct 3 17:41:44 2014 UTC,"Interesting, I actually didn't know they had tours in Everett. I wish Charleston would open final assembly for tours, such a cool facility."
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,Neurorational,2,Fri Oct 3 17:58:24 2014 UTC,"Did they tell you that on the tour? I don't see anything in the IAM contract about cameras or photos:  http://www.iam751.org/pages/IAM_751_Contract_eff_010314.pdf  Boeing has always had a no-cameras (including for employees) policy for ""security""; they used to prohibit cellphones with cameras but they had to add an exemption once it became nearly impossible to find a cellphone without one."
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,mb79,2,Fri Oct 3 21:28:53 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. They did not give the reasons as part of the official tour. I asked our guide afterward and she stated it was part of some type of agreement between Boeing and the workers and because they obviously don't want to be on an outsider's video or image at all times particularly when a mistake could be made. I don't recall whether her exact words included ""contract"" or ""agreement"" so I'm definitely not 100% sure on that detail."

MachinePorn,2i6qfa,RedOctShtandingBy,10,Fri Oct 3 15:48:28 2014 UTC,"The 787 line is pretty quiet since no riveting takes place. The 747, 767, and 777 lines can get loud."
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,An0k,3,Fri Oct 3 16:31:01 2014 UTC,No riveting at all? Even with all this composite this seems unlikely.
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,Neurorational,6,Fri Oct 3 17:21:09 2014 UTC,There are many metal fasteners in the 787 but few or no rivets. The structural fasteners are various types of bolts.
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,An0k,5,Fri Oct 3 21:20:32 2014 UTC,"Ok so this thread on airliners.net seems to be full of competent people and the general consensus is that there is no rivets on the outside of the skin but they are still used on the aluminum stringers and such.  And this article claim they saved 50,000 rivets by going with composites."
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,Neurorational,7,Fri Oct 3 21:32:09 2014 UTC,"The stringers are CFRP (""composite"") and are integral with the skin. The frames are CFRP and titanium and are bolted to the skin. Various fittings are aluminum or titanium and are bolted in. There are various small aluminum parts used on the 787, nearly all held together by bolts (including Hi-Loks and LockBolts - those are brand names but they're used genarically).  I've worked extensively on the 787 and offhand I can't think of seeing a single rivet, although there probably are a few on small aluminum assemblies.  Aerospace rivets are generally aluminum, and aluminum hates being in contact with carbon (where aluminum parts contact CFRP, special coatings and sealant have to be used between them)."
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,everythingchanges,8,Fri Oct 3 21:49:51 2014 UTC,"Very! Over 120dba.  Since it's an assembly plant there is a lot of riveting parts together. You can imagine how loud that would inside a hallow, aluminum structure. Imagine doing it for a 40 hour work week.   Hearing loss is strictly monitored to prevent as much as possible and hearing protection is heavily enforced. Generally you wear double hearing protection, in the ear buds and over the ear protection. You also limit how much noise a riveter is exposed to in a day."
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,sheravi,5,Fri Oct 3 16:31:35 2014 UTC,Have they solved the random fires issue these have had?
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,everythingchanges,1 point,Fri Oct 3 15:51:02 2014 UTC,Yes!  The battery was caching fire. They built a box around the battery to starve the fire of oxygen.
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,airshowfan,10,Fri Oct 3 16:32:42 2014 UTC,"It's a lot more complicated than that. The box is not ""the"" solution, it's a last resort in case the redesigned battery (redesigned to be much less likely to catch fire) catches fire. See here, here, here, here, here, and here."
MachinePorn,2i6qfa,sheravi,3,Fri Oct 3 16:47:17 2014 UTC,"So, now the battery won't catch fire or it will just be contained if it does?  Edit: Nevermind, /u/airshowfan already answered this."

MachinePorn,2i60jw,mckrayjones,1 point,Fri Oct 3 08:40:11 2014 UTC,"Not due to the size, but the way it makes power, yes?"
MachinePorn,2i60jw,oldaccount,3,Fri Oct 3 14:51:19 2014 UTC,Both usually make power via an engine running an alternator. I think the difference is how the engine's power is used. If 100% of the engines power is used to power the alternator then the whole thing is called a generator. If the engine also powers things other than the alternator then it is usually referred to separately as engine and alternator.
MachinePorn,2i60jw,fatcat2040,4,Fri Oct 3 11:48:25 2014 UTC,"An alternator generates alternating current, while a generator generates direct current. That's more what I was meaning."
MachinePorn,2i60jw,Duckbilling,5,Fri Oct 3 12:15:38 2014 UTC,"A generator is a combination of a mechanical power source (engine, turbine, etc...) and an alternator that converts that mechanical energy into electrical energy. Alternators produce alternating current. If a generator is producing direct current it is because it also has a rectifier to convert the alternators output."
MachinePorn,2i60jw,mynameisalso,3,Fri Oct 3 13:23:19 2014 UTC,"I think he meant a dynamo, which on older cars is called a generator and was used instead of an alternator. Mk1 Beetles have generators rather than alternators."

MachinePorn,2i3o58,littlefield20,5,Thu Oct 2 16:16:17 2014 UTC,"I recently learned something new about steam engines. Douglas Self's archive is something quite monumental and highly recommended.  So, the last decade of steam power was actually after the advent of the diesel engine. The steam industry made one last push in order to stay competitive, they called it The High Speed Steam Engine. Among many other refinements this technology also included forced lubrication just like the cars of today. In order to keep the oil from splashing around the crank case had to be completely closed, again like the cars of today.   Once all the moving machinery was closed it was almost indistinguishable from its contemporary diesel brethernand and so was lost all the allure of the steam engine.   As somebody once said, a running engine is just an engine, a running steam engine is an event. I guess he liked seeing all the moving bits."
MachinePorn,2i3o58,HAL-42b,5,Thu Oct 2 19:21:44 2014 UTC,"The high speed steam engine is actually not ""the one last push"" as you would imply. Neither was it a push ""in the last decade of steam power"", as such a decade is impossible to define, traditional steam engines are still being used and even built for industrial purposes. The concept is quite old, the same as the concept of enclosed crankcases. However the statement can be make to work the other way around - some of the most modern steam engines were and are high speed. This is because it brings the thermodynamical processes occurring inside the cylinder closer to adiabatic (it reduces the transfer of heat between the cylinder and the outside, as there is simply less time for transfer to occur). The reason for why it only became practical later is most probably the advancement in material technology. The refinements that happened in reciprocal steam engine technology (remember after all that steam turbines are in common use) happened too late to save them from being phased out in most of industry. This is mostly because of the fact that they were for the most part products of craftsmen and empiricist rather than engineers and scientists. This is of course with certain exceptions, like the German engines, huge machines with camshaft activated valve gears, which according to literature from the 50's I have at hand reached the efficiency of around 20-something to about 30%, comparable to 40% for turbines. And make note of the fact that the reciprocating engine is more versatile for most tasks, and able to keep efficient at lower pressures. Germans, and others in fact often utilized a different technology to reduce 'wall loses' (the losses i mentioned before, caused by losing heat to the outside of the cylinder) by keeping the cylinders in steam jackets - larger cylinders filled with steam, to reduce the temperature differential. This was of course only possible on the larger engines. Almost ironically, the form of steam engine that is still widely manufactured and used is one of the most basic, and inefficient ones. That is the Worthington Duplex pump. Those machines hardly even let the steam expand. However - they are simple, and often work as back-up boiler feedwater pumps."

You can hold that up with a 5"" wide 4130 steel wire.  Or six 2"" wires.  Engineering!  On the other hand, balancing on top of an explosion is very difficult.  Also, the inside of the rocket is 90 kelvin, and the outside is 3600 kelvin.  My car works from around -40C to 100C.  Three saturn V rockets could pick up this machine and hold it in the air for two and a half minutes.  There are five engines on the saturn V.  The fuel pump on one of those engines operates at 41 MW.  Thats a decently sized power station.  Theoretically, thats enough to send this miner upwards at 3m/s if that power was applied with perfect efficiency.  Instead its applied to a 3 foot turbocompressor, again operating at 90 and 3600 kelvin on each side, and spinning at 5500 rpm, which isn't that fast except for how the tips are moving at two thousand miles per hour aka three times the speed of sound.

My honda civic has 8 year service life on a cam belt. I replaced it when it ws 8 years old...and 60,000 miles on the clock. I think the mileage interval is 75,000 miles. By comparison, my suzuki v-twin motorcycle has chain driven cams (two chains).

MachinePorn,2hy85o,chaosintestinal,1 point,Wed Oct 1 20:34:30 2014 UTC,Yes you are right. I never heard of the touareg w12. Just the v10 diesel with a tone of torque.
MachinePorn,2hy85o,ElectricWraith,-12,Thu Oct 2 14:45:23 2014 UTC,"Am I the only one seeing that that engine is a V12, not a W12? Awesome clip, just being a bit pedantic.  If you guys like watching stuff like this, check out How It's Made either on the site or on Discovery's Science Channel. Some the episodes are a bit boring, but many of them have really cool, detailed looks at automated manufacturing processes. They did a series of episodes focused on supercars a while back, it was sweet. They do an awesome job of showing high-speed machines in slow motion, some of the ways things are produced are mind-blowing."
MachinePorn,2hy85o,trainspotting2,4,Thu Oct 2 16:02:31 2014 UTC,"Yes, you are. It's 4 banks of 3 cylinders each, not 2 banks of 6."
MachinePorn,2hy85o,ElectricWraith,-1,Fri Oct 3 01:53:28 2014 UTC,"I only see two banks, not four. So how is two banks of two rows of three cylinders a W configuration and not a V? A true W12 is three banks of four cylinders, isn't it?"
MachinePorn,2hy85o,trainspotting2,2,Wed Oct 1 12:13:50 2014 UTC,"Looking at it from the end of the crank, 3 banks of 4 looks like a V with a post in the middle. 4 banks of 3 looks like a W. make sense?"
MachinePorn,2hy85o,ElectricWraith,-2,Wed Oct 1 14:45:07 2014 UTC,"Not really, and that Bentley engine isn't a true W. From what I've just looked up, given that I wasn't familiar with it, it's technically a VV design.  I consider a bank of cylinders to be a group of them, each forming a leg of the particular 'letter' in the engine type. Two banks in a 'V', same in an 'L' (Ducati, for example), one in an 'I'. So, that's what led me to think that the Bentley is a V, not a W."
MachinePorn,2hy85o,trainspotting2,4,Wed Oct 1 17:49:05 2014 UTC,"'VV' looks an awful lot like 'W' to me.  Besides, the engineers who built the thing call it a W. Why are you arguing the semantics of it on the internet?"
MachinePorn,2hy85o,kliff0rd,2,Wed Oct 1 17:59:46 2014 UTC,"What you consider to be a W engine, and what the entire industry thinks is a W engine are different.  Two V blocks put together is a pretty common way of describing what a W engine is to people who are unfamiliar with the design.  Out of curiosity, what letter do you give to a boxer engine?"
MachinePorn,2hy85o,ElectricWraith,1 point,Wed Oct 1 18:06:16 2014 UTC,"It's not a question of what I alone consider to be a W engine. Nor do I think 'the entire industry' thinks the Bentley W12 is the standard for a W layout. Again, not being familiar with that particular engine, it took a bit of research for me to understand that that's essentially two 15 degree V6 engines in each leg of the very obvious V that they make. I had never seen that thing up close, and I've learned something today. To me, a W engine is something like '\'|/ (ignore the single quotes because formatting).   Boxer engines commonly have an H designation, but that's because they're horizontally opposed, much like I engines are so-called because they're inline cylinder arrangements."

MachinePorn,2hwpvw,gingi_chipmunk,6,Wed Oct 1 02:07:34 2014 UTC,"Actually you never really stop to think about how much america depends on a diesel engine. Think about it. If you buy something at a supermarket, how did it get there, diesel powered trucks. That is just the tip of the iceberg. You can pretty much connect any product in america with diesel powered vehicles."
MachinePorn,2hwpvw,drewtam,10,Wed Oct 1 02:51:30 2014 UTC,"Diesels are the workhorse that build civilization...  The online order went first through a Google search, and then Amazon logistics system, which each have huge farms of servers supported by hundreds of large diesels ready to provide emergency power in case the grid ever fails. After all, 1 hr of server outage could be millions of dollars lost in sales revenue.  The diesel powered step-truck brought the goods from the UPS logistics center to the buyers doorstep. The logistics center sorted the packages which were offloaded from a diesel powered class 8 tractor trailer. In turn, this truckload came from the inter-modal rail yard or nearby warehouse, which brings in goods by rail to a central distribution hub. The trains are a mix of large high speed diesel (shunting) and large medium speed diesel (line-haul). The warehouse was built, the rail was laid, and the roads were graded and paved by a plethora of diesel powered heavy equipment from bulldozers, excavators, wheel loaders, motor graders, tracked loaders, to cranes, telehandlers, scissor-lifts, and specialty paving equipment and track laying equipment.   The goods arrived from a natural gas and coal powered factory. The factory also had diesel / nat gas industrial engines to power certain machinery or just for back up power. The coal for the power plant was mined by very large diesel mining trucks, shovels, wheel loaders, and bulldozers and was shipped by diesel powered locomotives (the coal mine has a continuous line of trains running through getting loaded). The natural gas for the power plant was pumped by diesel powered frac engines and line pump engines that run both diesel and field gas.  Much of the intermediate processed materials used by the factory were brought from China/Japan/EU/So America by oceanic shipping running very large slow speed 2-stroke diesel, which achieve an amazing 50% thermal efficiency. All those other heavy equipment use high speed diesels, but still achieve very high thermal efficiencies of 40 to 45%. The intermediate processed materials were made from plastic/iron/misc metals harvested from the earth by the same kind of diesel powered mining and well service equipment mentioned for the power plants above. [The recent increase in US shale oil is shipped mostly by diesel powered locomotives.] The intermediate processed materials were shipped to the factory from the international port via diesel powered train and truck.  Lunch for all the workers in the entire economic stream was planted, irrigated, and harvested by diesel powered tractors, industrial pumps, and combines. Or if they ate fish, was harvested by fishing trawlers powered by large high speed diesels. (The beef and chicken eats the field corn and oats or whatever by those same crop farms.)  Unfortunately, some of the men were injured during all this work. So they were sent to a hospital constructed by all the same diesel powered heavy equipment, and has the same large high speed diesel generators for backup power. The building was constructed using materials mined and quarried by heavy diesel powered equipment.  After a hard day's work, they drive home on roads built by diesel powered construction equipment. And enter their houses and apartments built using diesel powered small and medium sized construction equipment."

MachinePorn,2hwpvw,naughtykittyvoice,5,Wed Oct 1 03:47:09 2014 UTC,"If you only have one kind of fuel on the battlefield, it's much easier to supply.  Most military vehicles now can run on jet fuel (tanks, diesel trucks, tractors, armored vehicles, etc) so we see the same thing happening.  During WW2, nearly all military vehicles ran on gasoline, so you only had one supply line for fuel.  Gasoline engines were much more advanced than diesel engines in WW2 as well, so it made sense to use them here."
MachinePorn,2hwpvw,mynameisalso,2,Wed Oct 1 05:38:27 2014 UTC,"The U.S. did not have the capacity to produce high precision machined parts like injection pumps in the huge volume needed. We could do mass production, but not nanometer precise mass production. By the end of the war we were getting there, with direct injection on late R-3350's, but we just couldn't build fuel injectors and injection pumps in the quantities needed to feed the war."
MachinePorn,2hwpvw,mynameisalso,2,Wed Oct 1 06:50:27 2014 UTC,"Not to mention the supercharging if you want any sort of power or even start if it is a two stroke.

Instead of just a huge gas engine the only disadvantage is the gasser chugs fuel."

MachinePorn,2hv12p,Usuallyfaded,7,Tue Sep 30 10:59:54 2014 UTC,"Yes, you're right.  When the plane was first designed, they knew that the Corsair had plenty of horse and torque - so they designed it with a huge prop to give the aircraft the speed it became well-known for.  When they realized that there wasn't enough ground clearance, they invented the ""gull wing"" design to push the landing gear down toward the ground and solve the clearance problem.  Longer gear couldn't be fit into the wings and would have interfered with everything from the fuel tanks to the in-wing machine guns."

MachinePorn,2hv12p,RacerX09,11,Tue Sep 30 13:37:29 2014 UTC,"That's partly true. The pilot did ground strike the prop but the accident occurred when he braked too hard while taxiing, nosing the plane forward. All four blades were damaged but only one was ruined and was replaced with a scavenged white blade. 57 went on to win the trophy with this odd prop color scheme so now it's retained for authenticity.

Glenn has to call up the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (as FirstEnergy) and Cleveland Public Power whenever they are thinking about firing this sucker up -- as it messes with their transmission-level (not just distribution-level) power flow and generation dispatch, and they have to make adjustments at regional substations before they let it rip to prevent brownouts.  edit: For scale, if they were to power it locally, they would need a gas turbine like this."

MachinePorn,2hsld6,vonHindenburg,2,Mon Sep 29 18:27:51 2014 UTC,"Most likely some sort of labyrinth seal as can be seen on the left side of this image.  The seal works by creating a series of small air pockets of continually declining pressure.  The gas has to follow a twisting path from one pressure level to the next.  This is more effective than a single, large pressure drop from inside to outside.  Axials like this would not have seals between each stage of the compressor (each row of blades) because the pressure differential from one stage to the next is fairly low.  They do, however, add up over the length of the rotor."

In the 1980s the Romeo Vickers consortium were developing nuclear power stations and equipment for Trident submarines. For part of the work they required a large pipe-bending machine and so a joint venture was set up between Romeo Vickers and the British Steel Corporation at Tipton to develop a suitable machine for the purpose. The design and building work for the machine was contracted out to four companies by the project managers at B.S.C. as follows: Babcock Power Limited, Research Centre, Renfrew carried out design and development work. Bigwood & Company of Wolverhampton carried out the mechanical, structural and hydraulic work and did the final assembly. Lightwood Engineering produced the electrical layout. Radyne of Wokingham, Berks designed and built the necessary electronic control equipment. The machine has an impressive specification. It is capable of bending a 36 inch diameter pipe with 4 inch thick walls and can equally handle a 6 inch diameter pipe with quarter inch walls. The machine includes an induction heater to heat the pipe and a water and air cooling system to cool the pipe after bending. The temperature is accurately controlled and the water system filters and recycles the water for reuse. There is a triple axis movement of the rolls and coils, with forward, backward, up and down control of the pipe and independent adjustment of the heating coils.

MachinePorn,2hlzxw,notthisfuckingguy,16,Sat Sep 27 12:55:30 2014 UTC,"That's the stab plate for the HFL/EFL (hydraulic or electrical flying lead, basically a subsea extension cord) to hook up to it. As you can see there is also an electrical hook up. There are also the four hydraulic cylinders around the circumference that lock the stab plate into place so it doesn't fall out on the sea floor. I actually work for Aker so feel free to ask anymore questions."
MachinePorn,2hlzxw,Phototropically,3,Sat Sep 27 17:22:21 2014 UTC,What does it do?
MachinePorn,2hlzxw,notthisfuckingguy,2,Sat Sep 27 19:56:03 2014 UTC,Anything that could be done with it topside. From moving earth to ensure equipment is anchored in all the way (sand in this case) to performing work that an ROV can't preform. I would assume it usually performs more complicated repair work for the subsea equipment that an ROV can't accomplish.
MachinePorn,2hlzxw,ringmaker,2,Sun Sep 28 16:44:14 2014 UTC,"I actually work for Aker so feel free to ask anymore questions.   I have a bunch of questions for you then!   Do you have any pictures of the cable/umbilical? What does the other end of the plug look like? Is the connection done ship board or at depth? What kind of syntactic foam do you use for that kind of depth? Where can I get some? Is the power cable lowered from the ship, or is there a subsea power hub it can connect to? What are some challenges you have to deal with when building/designing for such depth and extreme working pressures? That thing looks clearly overbuilt compared to normal above ground machines. What kind of power cable do you use for such deep, high pressure work?"
MachinePorn,2hlzxw,notthisfuckingguy,2,Sun Sep 28 08:03:06 2014 UTC,"1)  This video kinda gives you a good idea of a subsea field layout: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ-1POs_i7M  For pictures of umbilcals, I would just google ""subsea umbilicals."" There are so many I could give links for days. The only real difference between an umbilical and an HFL/EFL is the the HFL/EFL has quick connects on both ends. The umbilical is terminated with a distribution block attached at both ends, or a distribution block attached to one end and a topside connection (for the oil rig) on the other end. The HFL/EFL is typically a shorter length for quick jumps between subsea equipment where as an umbilical is made for long runs between fields or a topside connection to the production equipment (oil rig).   2) You can see several views of the mechanism here: http://www.technip.com/sites/default/files/technip/publications/attachments/DUCO_stab_plate.pdf   3) It can be done on the ship, or by an ROV at depth  4) We don't do buoyancy usually, we most likely would have contracted that work to Trelleborg or Balmoral  5) Either way. Although I would assume it comes from the ship. I would doubt they would free up lines from an umbilical, through a distribution center, then to the Crawler.  6) Like I said in a previous comment, I don't work on this actual machine. I have done some looking around the web and it looks like Aker built it for above ground use, then sent it to another company for subsea retrofitting.  7) The power cables are nestled inside the HFL/EFL/umbilical. It's not as damaging as you would imagine. They're pretty standard 6-16 mm2 cables with a usual count of four conductors  aramid braided cover and sheathed with a PE jacket. For this machine, and most subsea stuff, most of the heavy stuff is done by hydraulics. The electrical cables are more for communication with the equipment."

MachinePorn,2hlbo2,FoodBeerBikesMusic,10,Sat Sep 27 10:18:34 2014 UTC,"A little overstated, yes it to up a lot of the internal volume but not quite that much. The turbo was behind the pilot but that diagram is exaggerated."
MachinePorn,2hlbo2,spoonified,5,Sat Sep 27 06:03:57 2014 UTC,"But what you got was altitude, which was really the name of the game at the time."
MachinePorn,2hlbo2,wintertash,2,Sat Sep 27 07:56:45 2014 UTC,Exactly. The boost regulation system was designed to maintain sea level pressure in the manifold up to high altitude. The throttle on the injection carburetor would not open fully at low altitudes to keep manifold pressure from going too high. The wastegate was used to control turbo RPM.
MachinePorn,2hlbo2,naughtykittyvoice,24,Sat Sep 27 10:58:02 2014 UTC,The turbo-supercharge system should not be confused with an ordinary forced induction. It is actually middle ground between forced induction and a turbo-compound system which is basically a jet engine with combustion chambers swapped with an internal combustion engine. Reference  Also a moving picture
MachinePorn,2hlbo2,HAL-42b,8,Sat Sep 27 06:00:24 2014 UTC,"There isn't really a resemblance to a jet engine. Your description would be a little more accurate(but still not very much so) if you stated it was ""basically a jet engine with out the combustion cans and turbine section."" In a jet engine the turbine section is used to produce power to the rotor (shaft). Ultimately though this engine has virtually no resemblance to a jet engine.   Source: I track components for an entire gas turbine fleet."
MachinePorn,2hlbo2,QuattroStig,8,Sat Sep 27 15:48:06 2014 UTC,"There's definitely misnomers about forced induction.  From what I can tell about this engine, it was a force-fed turbocharger in series with a centrifugal supercharger powered from the crankshaft. (according to this diagram)  1) A compressor raising the air pressure above the external air pressure is forced induction.  2) Compounded boost is one compressor feeding another  3) Twin-charge is a stupid term. It should mean two equal charges from two equal compressors."
MachinePorn,2hlbo2,Erve,7,Sat Sep 27 09:10:33 2014 UTC,"""Turbosupercharger"" is an old term for a turbine driven supercharger; ie, what we now call a ""turbocharger"". In the diagram you linked you can see that the turbo is labled ""turbosupercharger""."
MachinePorn,2hlbo2,Neurorational,2,Sat Sep 27 14:13:34 2014 UTC,"The first supercharger in the line is definitively what we call a turbo. Its driven by the exhaust gases.  As for the second one I agree with what you said, it is definitively a centrifugal supercharger."

MachinePorn,2hlbbc,subhumann,3,Sat Sep 27 09:58:40 2014 UTC,"By prop clearance, you mean for the machine guns right?"
MachinePorn,2hlbbc,slime_master,5,Sat Sep 27 13:35:13 2014 UTC,"No I mean the propeller - being a tailwheel aircraft, on takeoff the nose will lift up so the fuselage is parallel to the runway/carrier.  This brings the proper closer to the ground. The propeller was large enough that the clearance was very tight, so rough  runways/bump/pilot error etc. would cause a prop strike. Normally you would just raise the landing gear so they were longer but this caused issues with the folding wing design, hence the crooked wing."
MachinePorn,2hlbbc,subhumann,5,Sat Sep 27 14:13:38 2014 UTC,"Clearance to the ground. The largest prop used on Corsairs was 13' 4"" in diameter. The bent wing raised up the nose to give additional ground clearance to the prop."

They quickly earned a reputation as being indestructible. Unfortunately the steel has been replaced by plastic from the late 1980s onwards. What are you looking to get out of them?""  You: ""Hmm, that's interesting, i have done my fair share of research and if i were to sell these on ebay i could get upwards of $100 per truck. I was looking to get a few hundred for the lot.""  Rick: ""Well, if these were new, and they came with the original packaging then maybe i could do half that. unfortunately Their condition plays a large role in their value, best i can do is $3 for the set.""  Old Man: ""Rick, back in my day this is how good american toys were made, the steel construction and lead paint were all part of the experience. These things were made to take the abuse, I think you should cut him some slack.""  Rick: ""Pops, you were born in the stone ages, they didn't have steel toys back then.""  Rick in the back room: ""I had this exact set when i was a kid!!! I would love to have these in my shop! in fact, i may just purchase them for myself!""  Rick in the shop: ""I have done some thinking, considering the history of the product and the condition they are in, im going to cut you a deal. I can do $3:50 for the set.""

After some thinking, you decide to have these fixed up by the american restoration guy with the frosted highlights. His bratty son decides to do some ""Extreme"" paint job on them and gets chewed out by his dad, the dad then sands it down and does the job properly and charges you $200 for a quarter of a can of spray paint and a half hour of labor. You then come back to the pawn shop with them restored properly by their expert.  You: ""hey loser, im back""  Rick: ""I thought you were going to ebay? Corey, take care of this guy for me""  Corey: He picks up a truck and looks it over, he pretends to find things interesting about the markings on the bottom, but in reality he has no idea what he is doing. he picks a random number between one and two hundred to use as a starting point and offers you $150  Rick overhears this ""outrageous offer"" and rushes over to help his clueless son.  Rick: ""I'm sorry, but there is no way im going to pay $150 for these, they have been ruined. Collectors are going to want something with the original patina, best i can do is $2.50 for the set.  You: ""I thought you said they were more valuable when they were in good shape?!""  Rick: ""Yes, well this is not always the case, how does $3:50 sound?  You: ""I saw these going for much higher than that, but you guys are the experts so i guess that's a fair deal.""  Rick: ""Great! $3.00 it is, Chum-lee write the man up""  You both shake hands, feeling good about the deal.

If you ever have to open up a vacuum chamber like this, to be able to get it back down to vacuum ever again, you have to bake it for 8-24 hours after you've closed it.

MachinePorn,2hfpoe,Mike312,5,Thu Sep 25 18:14:57 2014 UTC,"Since you seem like you know what you're talking about, I've always had a question about laboratory machines like this: why do they always look like they're massively overbuilt? Like, bolts every 1"" around the diameter of fittings, and all this steel that looks like it was machined down from like, solid 8"" tubes and 1' blocks"
MachinePorn,2hfpoe,zonky85,9,Fri Sep 26 05:34:24 2014 UTC,"Because they are... (Not a lab guy, but a mechanical engineer... Lumbering Jack, please confirm/refute...)  I suspect there's a few things going on here.   First, pressure can be very powerful, regardless of direction. When force it's applied to any object, it deforms like a spring. I expect that getting accurate measurements with a machine like this is dependent on repeatability. So make the spring as stiff as you can, so it deforms very little, almost no matter what you do to it.  Second, fatigue. This machine probably cost a few hundred $k. You may want to use it (or major parts of it) for 20 years or more. Boilerplate (overbuilt) parts have lower stress when loaded, so their useful life is longer.  Lastly, something like this sees lots of continual development. You're not going to spend time optimizing the shape of something unless it's significant to the experiment, so stuff looks blocky."
MachinePorn,2hfpoe,lumberingJack,4,Fri Sep 26 06:34:17 2014 UTC,"You're certainly right on your second point, and point one isn't wrong, although in the grand scheme of things, 1 atmo pressure isn't all that much if you compare with the pressure differentials you get in compressed gas systems and submarines etc. But, the main reason is each joint on the system has a copper (other materials are available, but it's always been copper in my experience) gasket between each section, and the flanges have a machined knife edge that cuts into the gasket to make a good seal. It takes a fair bit of force to make this seal, and it has to be evenly distributed around the flange, hence big flanges and lots of bolts."
MachinePorn,2hfpoe,zonky85,4,Fri Sep 26 18:33:25 2014 UTC,"Agreed, still don't under estimate it... Also, there's the stability issue (collapse) that generally shows up at lower differentials than bursting...  Didn't know about the gasket though. Thanks."
MachinePorn,2hfpoe,buckett340,2,Fri Sep 26 19:28:07 2014 UTC,"Part of the reason for all of the bolts too is to make a proper seal. The gaskets are flat copper rings, sandwiches between knife edges, the torque must be applied evenly around the flange to ensure an even cut and proper seal. Also, this machine will likely operate at 1x10-9 torr or lower pressures, which is equivalent to 0.0000000001 psi.  Because of this ultra low pressure, Earth's atmosphere is trying to crush this chamber to equalize the pressures."

MachinePorn,2hfwrk,asad137,2,Fri Sep 26 02:13:06 2014 UTC,"Pretty much any outer planet mission would benefit from RTGs.    I wouldn't argue the benefit part because of the efficiency of space and weight and the power is very constant, but is it feasible at all the have a Voyager type probe visit Jupiter using only solar panels?  http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/didyouknow.html  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panels_on_spacecraft   The electronics and heaters aboard each nearly one-ton Voyager spacecraft can operate on only 400 watts of power, or roughly one-fourth that used by an average residential home in the western United States.   So running with 400 watts as a minimum...   Gallium arsenide-based solar cells are typically favored over crystalline silicon in industry, because they have a higher efficiency. The most efficient solar cells currently in production are multijunction photovoltaic cells. These use a combination of several layers of both gallium arsenide and silicon to capture the largest spectrum of light possible. Leading edge multi-junction cells are capable of nearly 29% efficiency under ideal conditions.[5]   and let's go with 29% efficiency, at 55W/m2 , we get about 16 usable watts per meter, 400/16= 25 m2 of panels needed, minimally speaking.   http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/quick_facts.php  The Hubble space telescopes generates 2,800 watts with two 25 ft panels (I couldn't find the sq.ft.). So it seems to me that getting to Jupiter on solar panels should work just fine, although the RTG would be more efficient for other reasons, but possibly more dangerous.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight  In fairness, in space around Earth, solar panels would have the relative luxury of ~1,400 watts per sq meter.  But fun fact, the 75 to 90 kilowatts of power for the ISS is supplied by an acre of solar panels."

The arguments they lay out in the paper are for the Cassini mission specifically, but the points raised about solar cell size and fragility at increasing distance from the Sun can be generalized to give the reader an understanding of the costs and benefits of the two power sources.

Solar panels won't necessarily last very long on Mars, at least not compared to an RTG where your pretty much guaranteed to have enough power for 14 years (14 years being NASA's figure - but you just need to look at the Voyager probes to see how long it could last).   The RTG on Curiosity also has it's waste heat circulated through the rover to keep the temperature stable."

This ship, presumably, would never have to continue underway for 6 months during wartime (where you might not have access to cheap/easy diesel). Nuclear propulsion is one of those things reserved for the incredible corner case where the ship MUST operate for 5+ months at a time and not have to refuel to transit around. Getting food to the people operating the vessel is secondary to the vessels ability to travel in wartime.... sadly so.  Newest submarine, the Virginia Class will never refuel the reactor for it's entire life, 30+ years. The cost of that is much more than if it were a diesel sub with easy access to fuel, but nothing when you factor in range of the vessel, speed (constant) and the ability to project that vessels weapons/surveillance anywhere in the world.

MachinePorn,2hd8lj,Dannei,5,Thu Sep 25 12:09:59 2014 UTC,"Pre-nuclear submarines were diesel-electric, meaning they had electric motors running on batteries which were in turn charged by diesel generators. Diesel generators require oxygen to operate, which means they can only be used when surfaced. The prime advantage of a nuclear sub is that it can go long periods of time without surfacing. So, it's just not as much of an advantage on a non-submarine vehicle, where access to surface air is never a problem. Furthermore nuclear technology is much more strictly regulated than conventional means, for obvious reasons.  More: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-independent_propulsion"

Even the biggest ULCC tankers ""only"" had a dwt of about 580,000. I sailed on 300,000 dwt tankers. Those hulls were essentially full of oil.

Could be that this was the concept ship and the one that actually got built was smaller.

How can something only a little larger and twice the hull, even filled with fuel oil, couldn't possibly be nearly 10 times the tonnage. It's completely unreasonable."

They could hardly believe the ship.I had spent 4 months on was more or less the same dimensions as the Nimitz. (We were 332 meters long, 58 wide with a draught of 22-23 meters), and yet could carry 300,000 tonnes of crude. The also couldn't believe we had only 19 of a crew.

MachinePorn,2hd8lj,randomfact8472,2,Thu Sep 25 21:58:09 2014 UTC,Interesting. I suppose it makes sense when you consider that virtually the entire volume of the ship is filled with something consisting of more weight than a few people and a lot of air.

MachinePorn,2h2zjo,_Gizmo_,40,Mon Sep 22 00:46:18 2014 UTC,"Interesting info about the B-36 landing gear:  ""The XB-36 featured a single-wheel main landing gear whose tires were the largest ever manufactured up to that time, 9 feet 2 inches (2.79 m) tall, 3 feet (91 cm) wide, and weighing 1,320 pounds (600 kg), with enough rubber for 60 automobile tires. These tires placed so much weight per unit area on runways, the XB-36 was restricted to the Fort Worth airfield adjacent to the plant of manufacture, and to a mere two USAF bases beyond that. At the suggestion of General Henry H. Arnold, the single-wheel gear was soon replaced by a four-wheel bogie. At one point, a tank-like tracked landing gear was also tried on the XB-36, but proved heavy and noisy and was quickly abandoned."" More info here"
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,Treats,21,Mon Sep 22 00:47:08 2014 UTC,How noisy it too noisy for landing gear?
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,Neurorational,52,Mon Sep 22 02:08:17 2014 UTC,"As a rule of thumb, when you can't hear the jet engines, the landing gear is too loud."
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,lilyputin,5,Mon Sep 22 05:42:53 2014 UTC,First versions had six piston engines only and they were pushers! Then they added four jet engines for good measure giving it 10 engines in total. O_o I would imagine that the air crew couldn't hear much else... Not to mention it likely gave the soviets engine envy.  Really was one of the few times the USAF outdid the soviets in pure bat crazy bomber design.
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,robosubrosa,44,Mon Sep 22 21:04:43 2014 UTC,Found a related discussion  And here's what they looked like with a view of the whole plane
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,Warthog10,28,Mon Sep 22 01:04:28 2014 UTC,Ha! Looks like an RC plane!
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,sheravi,8,Mon Sep 22 02:06:40 2014 UTC,I'm guessing these weren't a success given that we don't see them today.
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,Shockwave8A,17,Mon Sep 22 01:44:12 2014 UTC,"They weren't a success but the idea is sound.  Tracks reduce surface pressure so a heavier object can operate on softer ground.  If your brand new strategic bomber can only operate from 3 airfields, you can pretty well guess what to attack and where they'll attack from.    Now take that brand new strategic bomber and make it able to operate from a dirt field.  It can be practically anywhere, making attacking it or defending against far more difficult."
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,P-01S,6,Mon Sep 22 02:49:12 2014 UTC,"The tracks would have high rolling resistance, though."
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,Saphiric,3,Mon Sep 22 12:26:58 2014 UTC,One of the interesting things about the B-36 was that it had both piston engines and turbojets. The jets were added later on to aid takeoff performance and sprint speed. Maybe they thought it was worth it since they had power to spare.
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,P-01S,2,Mon Sep 22 20:01:43 2014 UTC,"JATO is less fun than RATO, but it is still awesome."
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,kowalski71,1 point,Mon Sep 22 20:47:08 2014 UTC,"That may have incidentally been helpful for landing, maybe it would have acted as a braking device?   Probably not a very efficient one though"
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,uberyeti,8,Mon Sep 29 14:32:48 2014 UTC,There is development if small electric motors in aircraft landing gear (for taxing without needed to use more power from the engines) so maybe that's a modern interpretation of this minus the threads. I can't really see many benefits to this as it is so heavy and aircraft landing off airports have been able to with conventional landing gear without any issues.
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,BangkokPadang,12,Mon Sep 22 01:50:35 2014 UTC,The reason was more load bearing area for incredibly heavy planes like the B-36. It might also permit landing on softer runways like small aircraft runways or even grass fields.
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,zaphodharkonnen,11,Mon Sep 22 02:50:35 2014 UTC,"incredibly heavy planes like the B-36   Particularly with the payloads like the two 43,600lb Cloudmaker bombs..."
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,HughJorgens,8,Mon Sep 22 03:08:56 2014 UTC,"Not really; skis will have very high friction against earth compared to a wheel and you risk stopping the plane a little too quickly. Like, explosively quickly. Of course they're perfect on snow, but if you have a plane fitted with skis it's going to be completely unable to land on asphalt so it's only useful in snowy environments.  Lots of big, soft tyres are what you want. Like on the C-130. I can see the track idea coming back though, which if fitted to aircraft like the C-130 might enable them to operate from even shittier, muddier runways than they already do."
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,TacoMeatFromHell,-11,Mon Sep 22 09:57:38 2014 UTC,"Because, ""Let's put an army tank tread on our airplanes!"" Thats why!"
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,P-01S,5,Mon Sep 22 12:00:12 2014 UTC,I'd argue they were a success. They did the job they were built for which was to allow the B-36 to land at more airstrips.  However at the same time mutiwheel bogies were invented that could carry the weight of such a plane. And while the multiwheel bogies couldn't be used to land on dirt strips they were a lot quiet and a lot less maintenance intensive while still increasing the airstrips the B-36 could use by a large number.
MachinePorn,2h2zjo,huskorstork,2,Mon Sep 22 02:04:07 2014 UTC,"They were gigantic heavy airplanes, these heavy tracks probably impacted range and payload more than they were willing to give up."

MachinePorn,2h2zjo,SomethingWonderful,-5,Mon Sep 22 12:08:18 2014 UTC,"Airplane wheel bearings tend to have a near 0 drag coefficient so although they would have had more friction from the multiple wheels turning in symbiosis, they would have been able to take off"

If you really need to keep it quiet, a subsonic round can be fired through a suppressor without any ear protection.   Typically, that cartridge would be .300 blackout. It throws a 220 grain bullet just under the speed of sound. It's a very niche application. Think super duper covert ops or hog hunting.   I've heard a .300 black out bolt action fired with on of these suppressors and it was impressively quiet."

MachinePorn,2gqxac,IamWiddershins,6,Thu Sep 18 10:12:33 2014 UTC,What's the significance of the interrupted thread on the connection?
MachinePorn,2gqxac,BikerRay,13,Thu Sep 18 12:13:11 2014 UTC,4/5 actually!
MachinePorn,2gqxac,argeri,6,Thu Sep 18 13:10:59 2014 UTC,Looks like some impressive machining to accomplish that.
MachinePorn,2gqxac,reallifedog,8,Thu Sep 18 13:56:14 2014 UTC,"When you're firing things at 17,000 mph, the forces involved are immense. Would you trust a standard breach plug to hold up against something like that? Especially when you consider that if the equipment failed, it would fail spectacularly and catastrophically, likely resulting in loss of life and/or property?  If I were in charge of the designing, I would make damn sure that the breach plug fit as securely as possible, regardless of how much a pain in the ass it would be to manufacture."
MachinePorn,2gqxac,nighthawke75,2,Thu Sep 18 14:26:14 2014 UTC,"I'm merely speculating here, but perhaps for a more stable seal?"
MachinePorn,2gqxac,walrus99,9,Thu Sep 18 14:27:55 2014 UTC,That it is necessary and that it is so large (its much larger than most breaches) shows just how much force is applied.
MachinePorn,2gqxac,dawrg,5,Thu Sep 18 15:35:32 2014 UTC,"I'm assuming that 1 foot is the bore size. The length of the tunnel is 7 foot in length and is specific made to the task. It was not part of a gun assembly.  The tunnel is operated and maintained by General Applied Science Laboratory, now GASL."
MachinePorn,2gqxac,Buck-O,4,Thu Sep 18 14:56:13 2014 UTC,"I worked at NASA for a contractor at Moffit Field a few years ago. Right next to us they had a project very similar to this, they were using actual cannons from a battle ship for their work."
MachinePorn,2gqxac,Buck-O,5,Thu Sep 18 18:05:06 2014 UTC,"I would be extremely surprised if this was not built from an actual battleship cannon. They probably got it from some government garage sale and repourpsed it to suit their needs. Why reinvent the wheel? If these people are smart enough to get to the moon,  they should be able to make something useful out of junk. I wonder if they said,  We need to build a hypersonic wind tunnel; what can we make it from?  or, We have this old battleship cannon; what can we build with it?"
MachinePorn,2gqxac,Lighter22,5,Thu Sep 18 14:27:58 2014 UTC,"Can't be from a battleship cannon the bore is too small (though the Alaska large cruisers a 12"" cannons.  The barrel thickness is much to thick and too uniform (no tapering), 'if they used a preexisting cannon from a ship and built it into this it would have variable strength and they would have had to add layers, none of which would be a good thing... It might be possible, I just think it is very unlikely, I'm not sure when it was built either.   Edit: I think it might actually be a repurposed naval cannon now after some further research, see my following comment..."
MachinePorn,2gqxac,xcxe,1 point,Thu Sep 18 12:30:30 2014 UTC,"While it may not be an actual gun barrel, it is most certainly repurposed technology from a naval cannon. There is no denying that is a large bore breach mechanism, and I would imagine it was likely manufactured by a cannon manufacturer, as they would be the only place capable of actually performing the kind of precision machine work required for the pressures and durability needed for this kind of testing."
MachinePorn,2gqxac,rtwpsom2,2,Thu Sep 18 16:54:31 2014 UTC,"Most definitely. This went into operation in 1957 (its under the ""shock cannon section).  I've done some more digging and I think it is one of the USS Hawaii's 12"" guns three of which were removed from her in 1947.  The breach is very very simlar to the 16"" breach.  I wasn't able to find a pic of the 12"" breach.  It is missing a set of screws that appear in the all the images of the 16"" breach's barrel. These should be about half way between the inner sleeve and the outer sleeve and there should be at least 4 of them.  If it is from one of those guns its upside down, but that would explain the weld at the top of the barrel that would have been where the breach attached swinging down, and the pit to the bottom left of the barrel."
MachinePorn,2gqxac,75_15_10,1 point,Thu Sep 18 18:17:57 2014 UTC,"Great work, nice find!  It makes perfect sense to over duty the breech, especially for this kind of application. Though I don't think its inverted. Looks to be the same way up as the pic of the 16"" you posted. THey are keyed the same, and in the same orientation. I wonder is there is a sleeving of some sort around the barrel, and this is one of the attachment welds? Were the weld mark is, is where the breech clasp was located on the 16"" breech. So maybe its just filling a hole? Dunno...  Still damn fascinating to dig into it, and find out what kind of parts bin sourcing they used to make it all work for what they needed."
MachinePorn,2gqxac,rtwpsom2,1 point,Thu Sep 18 18:48:56 2014 UTC,"I actually think it might be one now.  I did some more digging (I'm a warship geek as well).

The Ground Systems Development and Operations Program completed testing of new traction roller bearings on crawler-transporter 2 (CT-2), on two of the massive vehicle’s truck sections, A and C, in late January. The new roller bearing assemblies that were installed on one side of the crawler are visible in this Jan. 31, 2014 image. CT-2 returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center, where work continues to install new roller bearing assemblies on the B and D truck sections. For more than 45 years the crawler-transporters were used to transport the mobile launcher platform and the Apollo-Saturn V rockets and, later, space shuttles to Launch Pads 39A and B. Upgrades to CT-2 are necessary in order to increase the lifted-load capacity from 12 million to 18 million pounds to support the weight of the mobile launcher and future launch vehicles, including the SLS and Orion.  > Read more  Photo credit: NASA/Kim Shiflett"

MachinePorn,2ghan6,jaynone,3,Mon Sep 15 23:24:46 2014 UTC,"The older pre-90's elevator systems used DC motors and controllers.  Some buildings are converting to AC powered lift systems due to the energy efficiency.  Unfortunately that means they don't operate as smooth as DC systems, and oftentimes, break down twice as often.  Just ask a company that uses KONE Ecodisc units. They love to cog and are not smooth operating as DC drives.  Plus their electronics SUCK!"
MachinePorn,2ghan6,nighthawke75,4,Tue Sep 16 00:40:04 2014 UTC,Thanks.  That kind of explains why the old elevators are smoother!  Why are newer freight elevators painfully slow compared to older ones?
MachinePorn,2ghan6,jaynone,3,Tue Sep 16 00:46:03 2014 UTC,"Once again, AC vs DC drive systems.  They operate slower due to the pulley and gear ratios they specify for the weight rating for a given car.  AC systems have to run faster to prevent cogging and lockups, DC drives can run slow and solder on.  There are a few other reasons, but the big push towards AC drive systems is energy efficiency."
MachinePorn,2ghan6,nighthawke75,4,Tue Sep 16 00:51:09 2014 UTC,cool!  thanks  Any trick to get a freight elevator to level itself after a big load has been added? We often have to move scissor lifts in elevators and they'll bounce an inch higher after the lift is removed and we still need to load things in to the car.

Hydraulic elevators tend to have a springy tendency due to the fluidics involved.  Just make sure it is centered in the car before starting out or it may put it in a serious bind."
MachinePorn,2ghan6,MrGrazam,3,Tue Sep 16 00:59:54 2014 UTC,I usually try to centre it but lots of guys like to put it all the way on one side for some reason!

It's not as pleasant as it appears to be.  I got stuck between floors in a glass-fronted elevator and it was surprisingly claustrophobic and I don't have that phobia.  Took all of 15 minutes for a maintenance to pop the doors open so I could squeeze thru."
MachinePorn,2ghan6,MrGrazam,2,Tue Sep 16 01:08:37 2014 UTC,Naa.   If they wanted the day off the would find a way into the machine room and bend 1 finger of a relay back at 90deg...then sit in front of the elevator till the on call service tech made it there.   Used to happen at the Domino's Sugar plant in Baltimore once a week.    Or they would run crash a forklift in the back wall of the 42k lb freight car so it caught on the hoistway wall.
MachinePorn,2ghan6,MrGrazam,2,Tue Sep 16 06:38:23 2014 UTC,"Well dc motors have dol control as it is the voltage that defines the rpms, where as an ac motors rpm is controlled by frequency. This gives several options for lifting purposes such as a gearbox at a set speed or by using an inverter system, this takes the ac sine wave and breaks it up and puts short bursts of voltages into the motor which can be programmed to mimic a dc voltage curve giving the illusion of a smooth acceleration. This does shorten the life of an ac motor and the cost of the inverter and extra components to control this is fairly expensive but how often do you find dc power supplies these days anyway? If you have any questions about electric motors I will try and answer them, another thing is that an ac motor has it's max torque at 50hz and that is where it is designed to run for cooling, speeds as low as 35hz are acceptable for short periods of time in well ventilated areas ( not a boiler room)"

MachinePorn,2g96hd,zynix,10,Sat Sep 13 11:36:19 2014 UTC,So it went in straight and when the nose was almost to the wall they started to turn it ever so slightly then forward then in and kept doing this until it was all the way in. They had to lower the loader once all the weight was on the plane to prevent the tail from hitting the side railing of the loader.

MachinePorn,2g8dyd,dan4daniel,8,Fri Sep 12 23:12:07 2014 UTC,"Nope, harvesting head.  A feller-buncher does just what it says, it ""fells"" and it ""bunches"" so you can cut multiple trees and keep accumulating then you dump, but the feller bunchers don't cut the tree again other than the initial cut from the stump, unlike the harvester that can cut to length."
MachinePorn,2g8dyd,minideezel,2,Sat Sep 13 00:01:12 2014 UTC,"I'm under the impression that feller-bunchers are a lot more popular than harvesters in North America, and vice versa in e.g. Europe. If that's true (anecdotally at least, you never see FBs logging here in Finland), I wonder why?"
MachinePorn,2g8dyd,laziestbarnacle,3,Sat Sep 13 01:35:24 2014 UTC,"Feller bunches are more often used for hardwood species as they often do not have straight trunks like softwoods, and the branches are too strong to easily delimb with a harvester head. Aditionally the rollers that pull the tree through the harvester head have spikes on them to grip the trunk, and they can cause damage to the trunk, which is more important with hardwoods that have twice the value and are likely to be used in finish applications as opposed to framing or pulp. For softwoods, cut to length harvesters work great, since that is what they were designed to work with, and are more efficient than feller bunches and have lower impact on the forest since you aren't dragging out whole trees, instead you can use a forwarder to haul logs instead of a skidded to drag trees, and you leave your slash in the woods, not on the landing."

I do however mourn that we raped all the forests of this size long ago.   Modern farm forests are fine, the problem is that they're all comprised of only a few types of desirable trees which are good for lumber and other uses. The 'junk' species of trees are not replanted, or encouraged to grow in the areas they were removed from to farm more useful to humans lumber. Biodiversity goes to shit when you do this. I live in an area that farms christmas trees. Miles and miles of billions of the same little fluffy cone shaped pine trees in place of a rather diverse forest landscape that used to be there.   It's not a 'wake up sheeple' thing, it's just human nature. We fuck up everything around us to make ourselves more comfortable for the time being. I can't change that, you can't change that, it's simply what we do and will keep doing as a species till we run out of easy ways to do it, then we'll figure out new ways to make ourself comfortable at the expense of the world around us.

The solar arrays are deployed in the configuration they will assume when in orbit. IRIS is scheduled to launch on June 26, 2013.  Understanding the interface between the photosphere and corona remains a fundamental challenge in solar and heliospheric science. The IRIS mission opens a window of discovery into this crucial region by tracing the flow of energy and plasma through the chromosphere and transition region into the corona using spectrometry and imaging. IRIS is designed to provide significant new information to increase our understanding of energy transport into the corona and solar wind and provide an archetype for all stellar atmospheres. The unique instrument capabilities, coupled with state of the art 3-D modeling, will fill a large gap in our knowledge of this dynamic region of the solar atmosphere. The mission will extend the scientific output of existing heliophysics spacecraft that follow the effects of energy release processes from the sun to Earth.  Image Credit: NASA/Lockheed Martin"

MachinePorn,2g4sa5,Sanspareil,12,Fri Sep 12 00:11:01 2014 UTC,11 kV is a bit low to be used for bulk transmission.  Edit: apparently it's for connecting water based generators to step up transformers.
MachinePorn,2g4sa5,Sanspareil,1 point,Fri Sep 12 00:16:24 2014 UTC,Exactly - the same goes for most generation. It usually stays at a lower voltage from the 4160 to 13.4kV range at the area of generation. The generators get synchro'd onto a low voltage bus and are then stepped to a nominal transmission voltage such as 115kV.
MachinePorn,2g4sa5,nickthenutter,4,Thu Sep 11 21:14:55 2014 UTC,"To a power engineer, no. Voltages mean different things to a lot of people.   To a telecom guy, 120/240 is high voltage and low voltage is anything over com cables.  To an automation/plant guy, 600 is high voltage and low voltage is 24/48VDC(PLC control voltages).  For a power engineer, distribution voltages(7.2kV-15kV) are relatively low compared to say medium voltages(ex; 46kV), high voltages(115kV-345kV) and especially ultra-high voltages(1MV DC or 765kV AC).  Anything <240 might as well be our ""control voltages"" because they belong in the control house."

Sick reference, I love mike holt's site - very good resource for the National Electrical Code.  I believe the IEEE reference from mike's website is from the IEEE Color Book series on Power. Pretty close to what I said but with general disregard to sub-600V circuits. Aside from the actual design, construction and testing of the substation, analysis of the ""low voltage"" system(120/240) itself is limited aside from short circuit and voltage drop for longer wire runs.  At high voltage on the line, there's harmonics, stray line capacitances & inductances, higher short circuit currents, protection schemes, protective & insulation(arrester) coordination, protection metering.  Not sure what you do for work, so forgive my long windedness - haha."

All generators that I've seen will have an output voltage of 10 to 20kV. This is then stepped up to 69 to 500kV for transmission.  Even a nuclear reactor will have a fairly low voltage.

This mean some corrosion will show on the connector, this is manly prevented with sacrificial anodes.  So the wet-mate part has been taking care of by another company, the challenges was to do it underwater with very little gear(ROV and divers). That why the cradle is there, its part of the mating process and not only for show.  We are making a cheaper version of this, that is not wet mate and needs to be taking on deck to be mated.

MachinePorn,2fy7hy,apestate,10,Wed Sep 10 03:47:34 2014 UTC,"The term is high speed machining.  It's just a shift in speed and feed and depth of cut based on the performance of new cutting tool coatings and materials.  Think about a grinder, very high speed, very high feed, and minuscule depth of cut.  Inconel is nickel based high temperature alloy.  These materials are tremendously tough, generate high heat from cutting, and are really awe inspiring to work with.    You are right in the assessment about heat, high speed machining aims to remove the heat with the chip.  Also, machines these days are increasingly built with linear bearing ways instead of box ways, so they excel at rapid movement and suffer a reduction in rigidity, although this horizontal shown is probably box, scraped ways.  Either way, modern machines plus modern tools makes it faster to go high speed, high feed, low depth of cut.  Plus, the machine moves around more and people like too see it look like it is doing so much.  With high temp superalloys, high speed machining is the only fast way to do anything.  I could do the same pathing with tialn coated carbide, coolant, and everything would be the same except 1/25th the speed.  You can't just hog out Inconel, no tool can withstand the force."
MachinePorn,2fy7hy,iride,2,Wed Sep 10 05:45:05 2014 UTC,"Well said. The key, as you said, is that the part/tool don't heat up (hence no water/coolant) because the heat is in to the chips that are cut leaving the part. *as far as I understand."

MachinePorn,2fy7hy,apestate,3,Tue Sep 9 23:19:47 2014 UTC,Tool life is measured in minutes.  This setup probably cuts 30 or 45 minutes before change out.  In the shop that might be an hour or a few hours before insert swap.  http://www.kennametal.com/content/dam/kennametal/kennametal/common/Resources/Catalogs-Literature/Industry%20Solutions/SuperAlloys_material_machining_guide_Aerospace.pdf
MachinePorn,2fy7hy,AnIndustrialEngineer,1 point,Wed Sep 10 01:20:29 2014 UTC,Also worth noting that the 30-45min life of a ceramic insert is 5-10x what can be gotten from carbide tooling used with productive cutting data.

MachinePorn,2fnsyu,MGStan,17,Sat Sep 6 19:47:41 2014 UTC,"The clockwork is real and works but it's just for looks and doesn't have anything to do with the actual drawing. Here's an article about Dick George the prop designer talking about the design inspiration:    George looked to one of his old toys for a method of getting the automaton to draw. ""When I was a child — I think I was either 6 or 7 — I was given a very odd toy for a Christmas or birthday present. It was a table football game, English football, and you had these little sticks, each of which had a magnet in it. You put the stick under the table, and the little football figure attached itself to the magnet. And you slid the stick around, and the football player followed the stick. It occurred to me that possibly this might work because we had a table that the automaton wrote on. And in actual fact, that's what we ended up doing. So it's a computer-controlled system that drives the mechanism under the table, but the hand is connected to the mechanism via a series of magnets.""   There are some real automatons that have been programmed to draw an image though."

MachinePorn,2fg0qi,Lele_,4,Thu Sep 4 23:21:21 2014 UTC,"A large part of the noise comes from the propeller hitting the air. One important thing to remember is that an automobile does not have the  weight restrictions that an airplane has. Cars can support excess weight on the ground but an airplane relies on air for lift, and have to be much lighter. So there usually aren't excessive muffler systems or sound dampening modifications on an airplane. I'm sure the design specifications for airplanes aren't as strict on sound either, in many cases."

Before entering the racetrack, the EFIS screen along with the PVI tells the pilot his actual speed, so he can adjust the entry velocity.   I'm still unsure of what it actually does and how it works.

MachinePorn,2fd4bp,TOO_DAMN_FAT,9,Wed Sep 3 20:25:44 2014 UTC,It's 540ci. The confusion with 390 is that there is also a 390ci engine in the Thunderbolt range.

MachinePorn,2fd4bp,Kiwibaconator,12,Thu Sep 4 02:14:45 2014 UTC,"2700rpms for a 390ci motor is nothing. Total displacement means very little concerning rev range. The geometry of the cylinder (bore vs stroke ratio) is a much better judge of rev range. There are oversquare (more bore than stroke) 400+ ci V8 automobile motors that can rev to 8000+rpms with a proper valvetrain and cam setup. Undersquare motors (more stroke than bore) usually have a lower rev range due to higher peak piston speed and crankshaft problems that begin to occur. There are tradeoffs, as undersquare motors tend to produce more torque at lower RPM's and oversquare motors produce more torque (and thus horsepower) at higher RPM's. Due to the power undersquare motors make at low RPM's, they are almost universally used for aircraft engines.  These are just general principles and there are exceptions to the rule.  Edit: Undersquare motors used to be universally used for aircraft, such as the Rolls Royce Merlin, but most engines these days are oversquare."
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,AlaskaTuner,6,Thu Sep 4 00:18:23 2014 UTC,"Due to the power undersquare motors make at low RPM's, they are almost universally used for aircraft engines.   No, they're usually oversquare to keep piston speeds low. Bore to stroke ratio has very little effect on engine torque, that's a misconception that keeps getting passed around."
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,TheBrokenWorld,2,Thu Sep 4 04:43:46 2014 UTC,good to hear someone else understands torque.
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,TOO_DAMN_FAT,1 point,Thu Sep 4 07:44:19 2014 UTC,"Yup, the limiting factor in engine rev's is generally mean piston velocity, which has nothing to do with bore-stroke ratios."
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,nerobro,1 point,Thu Sep 4 15:55:16 2014 UTC,"Well, it has everything to do with stroke, so if you want to achieve a certain engine displacement with a certain number of cylinders, and want the engine be able to achieve a certain rpm, bore to stroke ratio does become important."
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,dingman58,2,Fri Sep 5 04:16:28 2014 UTC,"Yes, but we're not talking hi-po engines here. It actually requires a huge amount of effort to make a 400+ cube engine turn 8000+ and stay together, and even then the life of engines like that are very short.   This is an airplane engine where safety/robustness of power plant is far, far above all other concerns. You throw a rod at 8,500 rpms on the race course, worst thing to happens is what you see is on NASCAR. No one dies. When an aircraft at one of those racecourses comes of of the air from a thrown rod and smashes into a commercial building... yeah..."
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,nerobro,11,Thu Sep 4 02:24:52 2014 UTC,"Displacement is not the thing.  I don't care if your motor is 1ci, or 14 cubic feet, 8000rpm is nothing.  So long as the piston speeds are low enough.    The limits of RPM on airplane motors really relates to propeller tip speed.  If you're limited to 2700rpm, you only need to make an engine that can handle 2700 rpm.  That means the valvetrain can be ""weak"".  The head and intake designs can be ""fairly poor.""  The cam profiles can be conservative.  And you can use really big bearings in the crank.    Big bearings on a crankshaft make the crankshaft vulnerable to oiling problems.  It's not a good thing.  However, big bearings, means you can handle heavier props, and their associated gyroscopic loads.    If you throw a rod on an airplane engine at 2500rpm, the engine won't survive.  But airplanes dont' fly into buildings like you're suggesting.  When engines quit, the plane becomes a glider, and you have seconds, to minutes, to point it in a safe direction.  In the case of the red bull air races, they're usually over water, so all you get is a splash.    Sadly, as engines go, airplane engines aren't all that reliable, or robust.  They're built using (mostly) 1930's materials and metallurgy.  The thing that makes them safe, is the magneto (losing the battery won't kill ignition) and the maintenance people do to them.  If you stay on top of a motor, they shouldn't ever spontaneously pop.    While we're on reliability.  The weak part of nascar motors, is the valvetrain.  The valvetrain is heavy, and that's the biggest limiting factor on those engines.  A stock, factory, smallblock chevy, could handle 9000rpm, excluding the valvetrain."
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,dingman58,4,Thu Sep 4 04:06:31 2014 UTC,"Piston stroke speed is correct, here's a little more for those interested.   It's essentially about piston acceleration and mass. High revving engines use a high bore-to-stroke ratio and as many pistons as possible. High bore-to-stroke means the piston shape and movement is fat and wide like a pancake, and only strokes up and down a little bit. A lower bore-to-stroke ratio would be more of a small coin moving up and down a lot further, like a column. The less the stroke, the less the piston has to move up and down and thus it doesn't need to accelerate or decelerate as much getting from TDC to BDC. The lower acceleration means lower forces on the connecting rods, wristpins, crank, etc.   High numbers of pistons (V10, V12) means each piston can be smaller than a V6 or V8 of the same displacement. Smaller pistons mean less mass, which again means lower forces on the bottom end."
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,Fastpony58,1 point,Thu Sep 4 05:01:30 2014 UTC,"A lot of that doesn't really relate closely to each other.  I mean, they're all things.. but ... well.  Lets look at each bit independently.    Piston speed is a good way to represent how stressed the bottom end of a block is.  With bigger pistons, you can use bigger rods, and longer bearings, and for the most part, make up for whatever size piston you want to run.  So the bore to stroke ratio really doesn't factor in.    But bore to stroke ratio DOES matter when it comes to breathing.  The bigger the piston, the more head area you have to put in valves.  Bigger valves mean you can move more air.  However, bigger valves, and a short stroke also leads to a really screwy combustion chamber shape.    Piston count comes from a lot of things.  It doesn't directly relate to piston speed.  It comes mostly from cost, emissions, and packaging.    Cheap pistons are simple pistons.  Simple pistons tend to be heavy.  Simple pistons can be strong, and fairly light, if they're small.  Big pistons that are strong, are expensive.  But.. can still be slung around at rather high speeds. (Check out 450cc dirtbikes...  They're essentially single cylinder F1 motors!  With a wear life to match.)  So, if you want to have a big displacement motor, you'll get the biggest cheap piston you can get.    Cylinder heads are expensive.  They have lots of parts, lots of precision holes, and have many critical surfaces.  The fewer cylinder heads you can have, the better.  This balances against the cost of pistons, and the manufacturer has to make that choice.  This is also why cheap motorcycles, and cheap cars tend to have engines with a single cylinder head, and a smaller piston count.    I said emissions, I probably should have said ""combustion factors."" The limit you're most familiar with, is emissions.  There's an optimum piston size for emissions.  This is why most engines end up with larger and larger piston counts for larger displacements.  The Viper, R8, and Ford GT ended up with 10 cylinder engines due to that piston size limitation, much more than any desire for faster crank speeds.    Piston size also relates to ability to handle detonation.  A reason why airplanes are flying on 100LL and silly low compression ratios is that they have big pistons, and big combustion chambers.  Big combustion chambers don't handle detonation conditions well, and tend to detonate early.  Changing the shape of the combustion chamber helps.  Smaller combustion chambers help too.  Smaller combustion chambers also keep more heat in the combustion gasses, so you get more work out of the fuel you put into the engine.  (Airplanes would benefit greatly from say.. mazda skyactiv style heads..)    Now, on airplanes, you end up with high piston counts mostly due to packaging.  You want the smallest frontal area you can get, with the greatest displacement.  That either gets you an inline engine, but inline engines have a huge weight penalty.  Or you get a flat engine.  Until crankshaft and crankcase weights push you towards a radial design."

MachinePorn,2fd4bp,things_most_foul,16,Wed Sep 3 16:55:46 2014 UTC,With such high Gs oil starvation seems like a much more likely issue. OHCs require oil to be farther away from the crankcase.

MachinePorn,2fd4bp,GurnZawarsky,1 point,Thu Sep 4 04:37:41 2014 UTC,I would imagine they do. However translating from cars (which are primarily only concerned with lateral Gs) to planes (which have lateral and vertical Gs) is a mechanical concept I generally don't comprehend. Even in dry sump systems there is still a sump (although shallower) that is dependent on gravity for the oil to collect.

MachinePorn,2fd4bp,TheBrokenWorld,2,Wed Sep 3 22:41:02 2014 UTC,There are a bunch of car engines that are used in ultralights.  Suzuki's G series is a fairly popular choice and they are all OHC.
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,That_Frog_Kurtis,2,Thu Sep 4 01:45:44 2014 UTC,"Also keep in mind the placement of the engine in an ultralight, above the cockpit (either front or back of wing) so it can be an inline (OHC) engine without getting in the line of sight of the pilot. For a regular single engine aircraft, an inline engine is generally too tall for an aircraft nose so a flat 4/6 is the usual option."
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,TheScriptKiddie,5,Thu Sep 4 03:49:46 2014 UTC,"Some kit-type airplanes will run Subaru motors such as an EJ22, and often turbocharge them. EJ22's are SOHC.

Edit: In other parts of the article you can read about the mistakes that were made in the design of the engine cooling system. The cooling system was designed to support 1,000 hp engines burning gasoline. The engines made around 600 hp and ran on methanol (which burns cooler than gasoline) so the oil never really got up to its proper operating temperature, making it difficult for the engine to pump.    This was just because the builders didn't know what they were doing, not because of a flaw in the engine design. There are more modern aircraft engines starting to come around that will likely more more reliable and better performing than these old Lycocontisaurus engines ever could be.  Also, a Lycoming engine of this size couldn't even come close to making 600 hp, those little Nissan engines did great considering the amount of power they were making."
MachinePorn,2fd4bp,LightningGeek,3,Wed Sep 3 20:37:23 2014 UTC,Oh no. No. That's not the reason sonny. They stick with it because it is so damn expensive to get anything new certified and the returns on that investment would be so small due to the fact that only GA and very entry level commercial operators run anything piston driven these days that it's just not worth it. Turbines get updated every year. There is money in turbines. Piston engines haven't moved on for the last 60 years because there ain't no money in them.

MachinePorn,2fd4bp,AldenM,7,Wed Sep 3 18:18:39 2014 UTC,Generally the races aren't about how fast the plane can go but how fast the pilot can fly. That's why they now use standardized engines and propellers.

MachinePorn,2f5b1z,kallekilponen,18,Tue Sep 2 15:05:17 2014 UTC,"Trajectory. Regular tanks aim relatively straight towards their targets, whereas a howitzer fires high up in the air to achieve a long arch to the target. Thus avoiding obstacles that may be in the way (among other benefits).  Source: Former artilleryman.  EDIT:  There are actually several types of self propelled field artillery. (In addition to the typical main battle tank, that isn't typically considered an artillery piece as such.)Leopard 2 A4 pictured Here are a few examples from my country:  • Tracked field cannon 152 TelaK 91 - Elevation: 2.5° to +58° Range: 27,5 km • Armored howitzer 122 PsH 74 - Elevation: -3° to +70° Range: 15 km • Armored mortar AMOS-FIN (XA-361) - Elevation: -3° to +85°  Range: 10 km"

MachinePorn,2f5b1z,ALoudMouthBaby,33,Mon Sep 1 22:08:56 2014 UTC,"What's the difference, really?   The difference is huge.  A self-propelled howitzer is designed to fire on targets beyond visual range. Its armor is much lighter than that of an MBT since it is only intended to protect its crew from counter battery fire and small arms. These weapon systems are designed to operate behind the front lines, delivering fire support and rapidly moving to avoid counter-battery fire.  A main battle tank on the other hand is heavily armored, and carries a gun designed to directly engage other tanks. The two may look similar, but they have vastly different purposes and designs."

MachinePorn,2f5b1z,ctesibius,7,Mon Sep 1 17:39:24 2014 UTC,"Self-Propelled Gun, or Self-Propelled Artillery, typically have lighter armor than tanks. Some don't have turrets, some don't have treads, they typically have longer range, and they typically rely on indirect fire instead of line-of-sight. Basically, a tank is supposed to be able to directly engage the enemy, while sell-propelled guns are more of a support weapon."

MachinePorn,2f3ehe,gtr427,1 point,Sun Aug 31 23:58:34 2014 UTC,I am currently of the opinion that holes make the breaking force greater on steel disks. I may have made this up. Have I?
MachinePorn,2f3ehe,Kenny_Dave,6,Mon Sep 1 00:07:16 2014 UTC,"Slots and holes serve the same function, which is moving hot air, gas, or water away from the rotors.   Cross-drilled holes weaken the rotor somewhat, so they're not often used in racing situations because they can crack under stress. Performance cars tend to have holes rather than slots.   Slots use up more surface area than holes do, and the rotors wear more quickly. Race cars tend to use slotted rotors, carbon-ceramic takes a long time to wear out.  Holes don't increase braking force, but they help keep the brakes working when you need them to."

MachinePorn,2ex74c,long_time_lurker2,3,Fri Aug 29 19:03:35 2014 UTC,"For anyone interested, the solitaire employs a method of pipelay called 'S-lay'. As the pipeline is installed off the back of the vessel, the shape as it extends down to the seabed looks like a stretched 'S', hence the name.   As other people have mentioned already, each joint (or sometimes double joints) are welded onboard the ship. A number of stations are setup for performing tasks such as - weld preparation, welding (might be manual or automatic welding), testing of the welds (ultrasonic testing typically), weld repair (if required) and application of field joint coatings and anodes. Due to the cost of these vessels, everything is geared around making the whole process as fast and efficient as possible. I would imagine this vessel would cost in the region of $1.2M USD per day.   Not surprisingly, the process of laying the pipeline onto the seabed is a closely monitored process. 'Dropping' isn't quite the term I would use. The 'S' shape as it is laid, also known as the catenary is most critically loaded as it comes off the stinger (overbend) and at the touchdown point (sag bend). The key to making this work is to maintain sufficient tension in the catenary, such that the curvature and hence strain in the pipe is kept within a safe working limit. The tension is controlled by a set of rollers (tensioners) positioned at the start of the stinger which grip the pipe and feed it through, as required. The position of the vessel itself is controlled by a number of thrusters around the hull and these are controlled using a dynamic positioning (DP) system, all computerised of course.   Just a bit of a brain dump there. The whole thing is quite interesting really. Typed on my phone so sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes..."

Its strong enough to just be heard and when demodulated the signal is encoded with location and an id. The frequency used is regulated so few if anything is interfering which makes the satellites orbiting job easier. Its sorta like tuning into a radio station from far away except no one else is on that channel. Radio wave line of sight also makes things easier.  Anywho after they pickup the alert they send out SAR which then homes in on a lower power local frequency.

Compare that to a modern GPS II satellite that has a power budget of 700 watts.  It's really combination of things, though.  The drastic improvement of computer power is probably the biggest thing.

Its dimensions were limited by what would fit on one of NASA's Delta rockets. Telstar was spin-stabilized, and its outer surface was covered with solar cells to generate electrical power. The power produced was 14 watts.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_satellite#Initial_Block_II_series   Two solar arrays supplied 710 watts of power, while S-band communications were used for control and telemetry.   http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/GPS_Space_Segment   The upgraded Block IIF satellites will produce 2450 watts."

The number of nested identifiers and layers of effectively tunneled data in 3G seemed a bit mad to me. 4G is more efficient at using bandwidth because ditches the idea of timesliced 8khz voice circuits which use bandwidth whether there's anything to send or not and replaces it with guaranteed minimum bandwidth packet based connections where no bandwidth is used if there's nothing to send.

It would have two shafts at least with one running inside the other, and the end of the shaft is wrong for what a gas turbine shaft would look like. This is far to big to be a gas turbine one one shaft. Plus the blades are shrouded and those are normally seen in turbine sections if gas turbine engines, not the compressor section.

At-speed (operating speed) testing for vibration is done in concrete-lined pits with all the air sucked out.  This allows for better readings and protects the operators from the failure of an un-tested rotor.  EDIT:  Here's the best public image that I can find of the test pit where I work.  (Guy in blue off to the right for scale)  The concrete lid that says ""Elliott"" is mounted on rollers.  Once the rotor is set up, the lid rolls over the pit and all of the air is evacuated."

They were effectively killed off by gas turbines - turboprops were smaller, lighter and more powerful."
MachinePorn,2ermza,Erve,4,Thu Aug 28 04:34:57 2014 UTC,"Not so much a dead end as the logical conclusion of ultra-high powered piston engine development possible for that era, in my opinion. The coming of jet turbines did indeed render all this irrelevant, although the Constellations were actually quite a bit more fuel efficient than the jets that replaced them and this remained true for some time.   You're right about the complexity thing though... mechanics at the time nicknamed them Parts Recovery Turbines, as they had to be opened up often and generally little bits of engine and turbine where rattling about inside. This is also why virtually no Constellations had second lives as bush planes, tankers and freighters, unlike the DC-4/6/7 and why they are very difficult to keep on the air show circuit.   Lockheed actually tried to make a prop-jet Connie, the L-1249/YC-121. It was, by all accounts a superb aircraft with 40% more power on tap than the piston version and a lighter empty weight. Test pilots called the prototypes ""Elations"" because of their insane take-off and climb performance. The airlines, however demanded a completely new airframe, as it seated too few people and the cargo area was tiny compared to barrel fuselaged competitors. They also feared consumers (who had been sold on the idea that jets=safety), who were used to Constellations, would not fully realize the new technology at play unless a new shape accompanied it. Lockheed nevertheless ordered all airframes still on the line to be strengthened and readied for turbo-prop mounting, even though they were to be shipped with piston engines, hoping that there would be a secondary market for conversions."

The long black cylinder attached to the compressors is the heat exchanger chamber where water circulating through the building is chilled by the compressors. The copper piping is the suction lines for the compressors, where refrigerant vapor is being carried back to the compressors after absorbing the heat from the building.

It looks like reverse osmosis is currently running at about 7 kiloJoules/liter with 50% recovery. That MIT demonstration looks cool because it is solar powered, but we would be better off with just using solar panels to power pumps in a reverse osmosis plant, if the goal is just desalination."
MachinePorn,2ems1r,MsChanandalerBong,2,Wed Aug 27 01:09:41 2014 UTC,I wonder what would happen if we rise the pressure to the critical point where there is no hidden energy for evaporation.
MachinePorn,2ems1r,HAL-42b,2,Wed Aug 27 01:32:52 2014 UTC,"You still have to heat it up over 370 C, and get the pressure up to over 250 atmospheres. That's a lot of energy. Plus, who knows what kind of damage the salt does to the equipment at those temperatures, and some of it stays dissolved in the supercritical water."
MachinePorn,2ems1r,MsChanandalerBong,2,Wed Aug 27 02:04:51 2014 UTC,Make it a closed system with a pressure release valve set at 250bar. You still need to pump salt water against all that pressure but the vacuum created by the condensing steam could be used to drive a pump just like a Watt engine.
MachinePorn,2ems1r,HAL-42b,4,Wed Aug 27 02:14:52 2014 UTC,"There is a thermodynamic limit to how little energy you can get away with using to separate salt and water.  From here it looks like the theoretical limit is 2780 Joules / liter, and given the numbers here it looks like they are using 7132 Joules / liter, with only 50% recovery.  So that gives us about 20% efficiency. At $0.10/kWh, its only .02 cents per liter. That seems a reasonable price to me, but of course that doesn't take into account equipment costs. Assuming we could build a perfect filter, we could drop the energy costs 80%, but good luck designing a better water pump. We've pretty much pushed the limit there. Any idea how much those filters cost? It looks like they are consumable.  Man, those unit conversions are a bitch. kWh/kGal? What the fuck? Engineers be trippin.

Anyway, I find the ending of that album quite interesting. It seems like the Soviets invested everything in one huge WW3 conflict with over 700 subs and ignoring carriers as sub-food. Looking back that seems like such a bizarre choice, considering WW3 was going to be decided nuclearly and in the mean-time Russia's boat-load of subs just sat around being useless. Contrast American carriers which have been a huge asset in conventional conflicts since the day they launched."
MachinePorn,2ek6n2,AlienSpaceCyborg,14,Mon Aug 25 22:58:40 2014 UTC,"If you haven't already, you need to submit that to reddit as its own thread.   How exactly does one go about this?  You make some very good points about aircraft carriers' usefulness during conventional war, but Soviet submarines would have definitely played a part in a conventional war (for however long it stayed conventional).  Of course the SSBNs like the Typhoon would have stayed back and kept up their patrols, but the SSNs and SSGNs would have definitely fought NATO units either while trying to kill American/British SSBNs or NATO aircraft carriers.  Nuclear war was always on the minds of the leadership of the US and USSR, so spending all those rubles and dollars only seems crazy in hindsight.  In recent years, the US has tended use its submarines for more missions than the Russians (land-attack with TLAMs, SEAL insertion ect.), but both navies get a lot of use out of them as surveillance platforms."
MachinePorn,2ek6n2,gooddarts,5,Mon Aug 25 23:17:41 2014 UTC,"I'd recommend submitting it to other subreddits of similar theme that allow albums. It really deserves more attention than it's going to get in a comment.  I said conventional, but I really should have said something more like low-intensity. All those soviet subs didn't really help the Soviets when they entered Afghanistan, but the US carriers were able to provide great aid (even inventing a fun term) to the US Veitnam war. The Soviets plans made sense in a conventional WW3 - but it strikes me as kooky to imagine WW3 staying conventional long enough for great naval clashes to play out. Contrast the US plans which acquired war assets useful no matter what happens - well, useful at the time no matter what. Modernly, it depends on how A2/AD turns out."

Yes, the American Navy's strategy has definitely benefited the US during conventional war and peacetime.  The CVNs and LHDs have proven to be quite useful for foreign aid.  To play devil's advocate, the US didn't get much out of its carriers and subs when it invaded Afghanistan other than a few tomahawk missiles and maybe maybe a few jet sorties (not really sure about that last part, but suffice it to say, the US Navy's ships haven't been of that great a use in Afghanistan).  In the Vietnam war, the Soviets sent an Echo SSGN to intercept one of the American carriers.  Whether or not she was going to fire her missiles, US aircraft and submarines harassed her so much that she returned to base.  Certainly the Soviet Navy including its subs would have played a big part in Vietnam if the USSR was more directly involved, but like you say, it's unknown how long a war between the superpowers could stay conventional."

MachinePorn,2ek6n2,PromptCritical725,2,Tue Aug 26 04:20:18 2014 UTC,"Wasn't their utility limited by US attack subs constantly shadowing all of their SSBNs at the time, waiting for the order to sink them if war broke out?  Please bear in mind that my primary source of cold war knowledge is Tom Clancy novels, so it's entirely possible I have no idea what I'm talking about."
MachinePorn,2ek6n2,PromptCritical725,3,Tue Aug 26 15:54:44 2014 UTC,"In the beginning and middle stages of the Cold War, yes.  The Hotels, Yankees and early Deltas had to patrol in the middle of the Atlantic.  They would have been easy prey for American attack submarines, which trained them frequently, although they couldn't and didn't have an SSN behind every Soviet SSBN continuously.  In the late 70s, the missile ranges of Soviet SSBNs became great enough so that they could patrol in waters near the Soviet Union, guarded by layers of surface ships and aircraft.  These were called boomer bastions and they were a problem for US attack submarines.  Although American SSNs could and did penetrate these barriers, it was difficult and in wartime might be impossible.  The chapter or two in Red Storm Rising where the American submarines have to launch tomahawks from the Barents sea is a good illustration of how heavy the Soviets defended the Barents and the bastions.  Even their aircraft carriers were designed to protect the boomers.  The American Seawolf class, designed specifically for penetrating the bastions, was quieter, faster and more heavily armed than its predecessors.  Still, the Seawolfs were only made well after the Cold War was over and only two SSNs of the class were made.  So the Soviet SSBNs were relatively safe during the Cold War.  The Typhoons were especially safe because they could hide under the ice where it is almost impossible to track submarines."

The Carter is a special-projects boat and therefore is an AGSSN or auxiliary nuclear submarine even though her hull number is SSN 23.  For a submarine to be an SSN, ability to do combat with other ships and submarines must be one of the top requirements.  Carter and her spec-ops predecessors, Seawolf (575) and Parche, had very little combat capability.  They could defend themselves if necessary, but they would never be intentionally placed in combat, and therefore are AGSSNs."

Probably why I volunteered for sub duty in the Navy.  Seeing a Typhoon IRL is on my bucket list.  I'm not too optimistic that it will ever happen, but surely the largest submarine ever constructed merits some sort of museum treatment instead of scrapping.  At least one boat dammit.  BTW:  You got any good high-res ""hero shots"" of my sub, USS Helena (SSN-725) or another 688 Flight II VLS boat?"
MachinePorn,2ek6n2,RexStardust,1 point,Tue Aug 26 20:18:44 2014 UTC,"Seeing a Typhoon IRL is on my bucket list.    You and me both.  I've heard that they are going to do.....something to one of the Typhoons.  You can submit plans for something that features a Typhoon class submarine (of course sans reactor compartment).  The application talks about creative use of the submarine, which worries me deeply because a straight-up preservation isn't particularly creative.  I hope they don't turn it into a hotel or something.  I'd rather they scrap it than the boat meet that inglorious fate.  I think K-3 Leninskiy Komsomol, the Soviet's first nuclear submarine, is going to be a museum.  I also hope that the Narwhal becomes a museum ship along with a 688.  It's such a shame that all the great US submarines besides Nautilus have been scrapped.   BTW: You got any good high-res ""hero shots"" of my sub, USS Helena (SSN-725) or another 688 Flight II VLS boat?   By hero shot, I assume you mean a high-speed surface run.  In that case I have one of the Newport News (you could probably get away with passing this off as Helena because there are no hull numbers on operational boats, haha).  Here's also a cool one of Chicago.  Also, check on Navsource as they might have some neat photos of your boat.  Can I ask you a question about the 688s?  Feel free to not answer because the topic is somewhat sensitive in terms of security, but not classified to my knowledge.  I've heard that there are two types of screws that the 688s used: a ""speed"" screw and a ""quiet"" screw.  Is this true, and if so, how are they different?  I know there are three types (at least) of 688 screws: standard 7-bladed, 7-bladed with vortex attenuator (mini-propeller on the prop hub) and 7-bladed annular screw for the 688Is (presumably for reducing cavitation)."

MachinePorn,2ek6n2,teuchuno,8,Tue Aug 26 01:22:56 2014 UTC,"It stems from a time when submarines were very small, like Holland's submarines.  Even the WWII U-boats were under 1,000 tons of submerged displacement (case-in-point: Das Boot).  Big nuclear submarines are a fairly modern development, so the archiac name has stuck.  Personally, I like it."
MachinePorn,2ek6n2,teuchuno,5,Tue Aug 26 02:03:34 2014 UTC,"In the album you said this:   [...] hydrodynamic signature, a disturbance in the water which the Soviet could detect from space at the end of the Cold War (that's a topic for another time).   Could you elaborate on this?  Some searching suggests that it might be possible to pick up an undersea wake by imaging the surface water somehow.  Do you know any more about how this works?"
MachinePorn,2ek6n2,Decimus86,6,Tue Aug 26 04:16:39 2014 UTC,"Most of this was copy-pasted from something I wrote in /r/WarshipPorn:  All submarines produce a wake, but different submarines produce different size wakes.  The biggest contributor to the detectable wake of a submarine are vortices that are produced by objects like the sail, control surfaces and screws.  American submarines have square sails (the Seawolf and Vriginia class have a fillet on the sail which helps) and relatively square control surfaces, which can produce vortices.  With a normal propeller hub, the screw produces a vortex too (some Los Angeles class SSNs have vortex attenuators on their screws).  Russian submarines have vortex attenuators everywhere and their sails and control surfaces are usually carefully faired into the hull.  It is firmly established that the Russians have this capability and our submarines are very vulnerable to it because they are not designed with hydrodynamic stealth in mind. The first use of non-acoustic ASW by the Soviets was in their Top Pair radar, fitted on some large cruisers and anti-submarine ships. This radar was able to detect atmospheric convection cells produced by the wake of a submerged submarine interacting with the air-water boundary. The second use of non-acoustic ASW was the SOKS sensors fitted on Soviet SSNs since the late 1970s. Victor III submarines with these sensors have tracked our SSBNs for several hours without the use of sonar. The latest use of non-acoustic ASW was the launching of maritime surveillance satellites that could detect the scars produced on the surface of the ocean by a submerged submarine (there is also the older and established technology of looking for thermal signatures of nuclear submarines). The US confirmed this technology as viable when they detect a submarine wake with special equipment from one of the space shuttles. Recently, several American universities have validated the physics behind the Soviet method. There are limitations. A very slow-moving submarine that is down deep (over 1,000 ft) is more difficult to detect and weather and night can affect the performance of the system. It is still very real and very dangerous. It does not, however, make submarines obsolete. Soviet submarine designers anticipated the developments in non-acoustic ASW and designed their submarines to leave as small a wake as possible (I think my album on the Akulas goes into more detail about this). Their submarines are very difficult to detect using the satellite-based ASW, but ours aren't. Although the pumpjet and fillet on the sail of the Seawolf and later American SSNs helped their non-acoustic signature, these boats are designed primarily for acoustic stealth, which is approaching the point of diminishing returns. The Ohio Replacement was supposed to have a design that would make it more hydrodynamically stealthy, but it was cut to save money. Many in the US submarine community regard non-acoustic ASW as a myth, but it's not, unfortunately. The Brits have wised up and their Astute SSNs incorporate some measures to make them more hydrodynamically stealthy.  I know this sounds a little far-fetched, but I have a friend (a noted naval historian) who's having a book published about ASW.  He's done quite a lot of research into this topic and seen some classified stuff and he assures me it is true."
MachinePorn,2ek6n2,cavetechman,3,Tue Aug 26 12:07:48 2014 UTC,"this is just awesome:   This radar was able to detect atmospheric convection cells produced by the wake of a submerged submarine interacting with the air-water boundary.   Do you have more information about how these atmospheric convection cells are produced by an submarine 1,000 ft under water?"
MachinePorn,2ek6n2,TheRumbleBelly,4,Tue Aug 26 12:40:25 2014 UTC,"The ocean can transfer a lot of heat to the atmosphere.  I took a summer course in marine biology and oceanography a few years ago and we went out on small boats every day to sample the water or collect organisms.  One day we went out to sea a few miles to collect chlorophyll samples and came back through an inlet in the barrier islands.  When we were about a quarter of a mile away from the inlet, the temperature went up 10 degrees F as if someone had flicked a switch.  It was absolutely instantaneous.  This is partially due to the presence of land, but mostly because the water in the shallow inlet was a lot warmer.  What I think a lot of people don't realize is 1. How much heat the ocean can give or take from the atmosphere and 2. How little large water masses mix.  So for the case of the submarine wake, the submarine imparts a lot of energy into the deep, cold waters where it's cruising, which makes essentially a 3D version of a surface ship's wake, an expanding cone.  This is what I think happens: This wake in the shape of a cone brings cold water to the surface, which is a lot warmer than the deeper layers.  Since large water masses mix so little in comparison to small amounts air or water that we encounter in our day-to-day lives, the cold water doesn't just cool down the warm surface waters, it replaces it.  This cold mass of water now sitting on the surface then takes in heat from the atmosphere.  This produces a cold and heavy mass of air that sinks, while the warmer air around it rises to fill it's vacated space.  This motion produces large convection cells that can apparently be detected by radar.  Of course, the effect is diminished as the submarine gets deeper, so a sub at 1,000 feet might not make a large signature.  Keep in mind that this is conjecture, as I only have a small amount of experience in oceanography.  Edit: Goodness, two gold in one day?!  Thank you!"

There are similar photos of the older US Navy boats, but ironically security is a lot tighter in American in terms of submarine photos.  For example, USS Parche was converted from a standard Long Hull Sturgeon attack submarine to a dedicated spec-ops boat with the addition of a 100 foot section.  No photos exist of her out of the water because they would put an opaque curtain around her even before the water was drained out of the drydock."

MachinePorn,2ekxmm,XNormal,3,Tue Aug 26 00:29:27 2014 UTC,"Turbopumps can definitely achieve better power/weight ratios, but the XCOR design philosophy favors reliability and price more than the usual aerospace approach of ""performance at all costs""."
MachinePorn,2ekxmm,HAL-42b,1 point,Tue Aug 26 05:10:00 2014 UTC,Usually the highest performance part is the cheapest one to fly. Even a liter of water costs 10000$ to fly to the ISS so they want to cram maximum utility in every single milligram.   What this design achieves is cheaper R&D which is a performance benchmark in itself.
MachinePorn,2ekxmm,EvanDaniel,3,Tue Aug 26 23:44:22 2014 UTC,"This is for a suborbital vehicle, not orbital. Mass ratio in the low single digits.  XCOR favors reliability. Their approach is that the way to get high performance high reliability, is to start out with high reliability and moderate (but profitable) performance, and work up from there.  This approach of reliability first also shows in the HTOL vehicle design, which is highly favorable to incremental testing and tests that fail non-catastrophically."
MachinePorn,2ekxmm,XNormal,2,Wed Aug 27 04:01:18 2014 UTC,Usually the highest performance part is the cheapest one to fly.   In an aircraft that will fly for a couple of decades lifetime fuel consumption overwhelms other costs so weight/performance is a top priority. In a multistage rocket every gram in the payload or top stages is very precious.  But in lower stage rocketry this conventional wisdom does not necessarily hold. Fuel cost is not (yet) a major item in rocketry. Tankage is also relatively cheap. Total liftoff mass by itself is not a strong predictor of total price.

A lot of the released photos are sanitized, via careful camera angles and photoshop. Or you just see photos of the assembled pump, when all the magic is happening under the covers :)  I only spent maybe a day or two helping out with that pump; most of my time was on the 40K stand and the 5M15 engine and associated support hardware."

MachinePorn,2edi2j,badaimarcher,5,Sat Aug 23 20:03:03 2014 UTC,"So, on each leg one piston only has one port, while the other one has two. Is that one port intake or exhaust? I'm guessing exhaust..."
MachinePorn,2edi2j,dcormier,8,Sat Aug 23 21:38:56 2014 UTC,"That one port is the exhaust, and the two are the intake. Having multiple intake ports helps scavenge the exhaust gases."
MachinePorn,2edi2j,AVeryHeavyBurtation,4,Sat Aug 23 21:59:10 2014 UTC,Can you explain what you mean? I'm not sure I understand.
MachinePorn,2edi2j,beaverjacket,15,Sat Aug 23 22:06:23 2014 UTC,"The way a two stroke engine works... After combustion, the piston(s) uncover(s) the exhaust port first, so the high pressure exhaust gases in the cylinder rush out of the exhaust port. Then the piston as it keeps moving uncovers the intake ports and fresh fuel/air mixture is pushed into the cylinder. The exhaust gases are not completely out of the cylinder at this point, and the fresh fuel/air mixture ""scavenges"" the remaining exhaust gases out of the exhaust port simply by pushing the exhaust gases out.  two stroke 102: usually, some of the fresh fuel/air mixture is lost out of the exhaust to ensure that all of the exhaust gasses have been scavenged from the cylinder. The exhaust pipe can be tuned to a specific RPM so when the engine is running at the RPM that the pipe is tuned for, a pressure wave pushes the little bit of air/fuel mixture that made it out of the exhaust port back into the cylinder where it can be combusted.  TL;DR: I love this gif: http://www.vespamaintenance.com/engine/primer/twostrokeact.gif"
MachinePorn,2edi2j,AVeryHeavyBurtation,7,Sat Aug 23 22:21:20 2014 UTC,"Worth mention is that the Deltecs were diesels and used direct injection, so no fuel/air mix i the charge air and exhaust tuning was not needed."

MachinePorn,2edi2j,AnnoyingMoFo,2,Sun Aug 24 02:15:45 2014 UTC,The gears are there to link up the 3 crankshafts so that the pistons move correctly in relation to each other
MachinePorn,2edi2j,thegnomesdidit,8,Sun Aug 24 06:04:32 2014 UTC,Here is the best explanation I could find
MachinePorn,2edi2j,GillicuttyMcAnus,5,Sat Aug 23 23:40:51 2014 UTC,"Its a 2-stoke engine   One feature of the engine was the way that crankshaft-phasing was arranged to allow for exhaust port lead and inlet port lag. These engines are called ""uniflow"" designs, because the flow of gas into and out of the cylinder is one way, assisted by mild supercharging to improve cylinder exhaust scavenging.   Scavaging is the exchange of exhaust gasses.   For just a few degrees of crankshaft rotation, both the intake and exhaust will be open at the same time. This lets the exhaust gasses escape, and new air to be taken in. This pleases the cylinders."

However I think he meant mechanical precision. In the tri-axial tourbillion mechanism, there are 140 parts.  It's a little over half an inch across  (13.78mm) and weighs 0.04oz.  To design, craft and assemble something on those scales is more impressive than stamping out plastic shells and adding an IC (which are fascinating in their own right for complexity)."

MachinePorn,2e9shm,ziryra,3,Sun Aug 24 21:41:06 2014 UTC,How do these affect drag? I imagine a big hole in the side would create some turbulent flow...
MachinePorn,2e9shm,Sandy-106,5,Fri Aug 22 17:09:09 2014 UTC,"I'd imagine that, relative to the size of the ship, the hole is pretty small."
MachinePorn,2e9shm,ziryra,3,Fri Aug 22 18:14:06 2014 UTC,Fair point. But keep in mind that large ships like this value fuel efficiency more than anything. Even some barnacles increase drag enough to reduce performance.   I imagine they could have some kind of swinging door that closes during normal operations.
MachinePorn,2e9shm,Sandy-106,3,Fri Aug 22 18:50:30 2014 UTC,Some commercial aircraft have exposed landing gear. I would think this would be similar to the exposed bow thrusters and efficiency in aircraft is pretty important. I suspect a door's complexity negates any added efficiency.
MachinePorn,2e9shm,Imacad,2,Sat Aug 23 01:44:46 2014 UTC,Exposed landing gear hardly has any affect on the efficiency. There's a slight drag penalty but it is mostly offset by the loss in weight from removing the gear doors and all the hydraulics needed to operate them. Exposed gear on the 737 only loses ~3% efficiency at normal cruise.
MachinePorn,2e9shm,HAL-42b,3,Sat Aug 23 02:17:27 2014 UTC,Ok. Are you saying that exposed bow thrusters would be create more than 3% efficiency loss?
MachinePorn,2e9shm,Imacad,2,Sat Aug 23 02:24:26 2014 UTC,Not really sure honestly. Aerodynamics and hydrodynamics have a lot in common but there are some things different that I wouldn't know about. Considering how big those ships are and how small those thrusters are though I'd be surprised if it was more than a 2-3% loss.
MachinePorn,2e9shm,ParticleSpinClass,2,Sat Aug 23 02:28:55 2014 UTC,They don't have doors.  It is just designed so that there are fairing on the hull which minimise the effect that the hole has on water flowing over the hull.

MachinePorn,2e9shm,sarcasimo,1 point,Fri Aug 22 22:54:36 2014 UTC,"LAkers do value efficiency, but since they're designed to fit within the confines of a set of locks it was decided the slightly increased efficiency of really any hydrodynamics was actually less efficient due to the resulting loss of cargo space."

MachinePorn,2dzrrh,idrinkcoldcoffee,1 point,Wed Aug 20 09:50:29 2014 UTC,"Can you shed any light on the configuration? Is it steam with a central input and exhaust out both ends? Seems kind of odd, but that huge central inlet isn't right for a gas turbine, right?"
MachinePorn,2dzrrh,desrosiers,2,Wed Aug 20 11:12:48 2014 UTC,"It is a steam turbine and, you're right, the inlet is at the center and the outlets are at either end.    The reason for this is load balancing.  Aside from the tangential push that spins the rotor, the steam also imparts a push along the axis of the rotor from inlet to outlet.  Obviously, you try to avoid this in design, but the basic concept of the turbine makes this impossible and the force will add up to sevral tons on a large rotor.  To counter it, you need a massive thrust bearing which, basically, keeps the rotor from shooting out of the casing like a spear gun.  This bearing is expensive, maintenance-intensive, and knocks a few % points off the efficiency of the turbine.    The other answer is what you see above.  This is a balanced rotor.  Rather than have a thrust bearing take the axial load, you just have, basically, a second turbine pulling in the opposite direction, to balance things out.    This also allows you to get more work out of a given amount of steam under certain conditions that I don't understand :)"

MachinePorn,2dygzx,HAL-42b,28,Tue Aug 19 08:44:39 2014 UTC,There is a video of everything
MachinePorn,2dygzx,JesusWantsYouToKnow,13,Tue Aug 19 09:46:16 2014 UTC,"What he failed to mention is presumably Toyota modulates MG1's speed to actually at as a CVT. You should be able to hold the engine RPM at an optimal point (HP, efficiency) and drive (or charge) MG1's stator to balance wheel speed.   Mechanically compared to an auto transmission it is actually beautifully simple."
MachinePorn,2dygzx,MattKronik,7,Tue Aug 19 12:35:06 2014 UTC,I am waiting for some company to realize that they could provide a manually-controllable CVT and completely revolutionize driving.
MachinePorn,2dygzx,Cj145,1 point,Tue Aug 19 18:32:56 2014 UTC,"I would think it's more efficient than a conventional automatic since there's no loss of energy in the torque converter, correct?"
MachinePorn,2dygzx,BeerPowered,5,Tue Aug 19 17:00:27 2014 UTC,"There is a lot of loss in the process of converting mechanical energy to electrical energy, and then back to mechanical energy however.

MachinePorn,2dygzx,hwillis,1 point,Tue Aug 19 18:41:31 2014 UTC,Neat.
MachinePorn,2dygzx,2delta,5,Tue Aug 19 10:47:33 2014 UTC,"still watching that video, but explaining it as simply as possible:  the idea behind a transmission is to keep the motor at a certain torque/rpm no matter what the speed of the car is.  An electric motor doesn't need a transmission because torque is constant regardless of the rpm.  The ""gear ratio"" between the two motors can be varied electronically with ~95% efficiency by changing the frequency of the driving voltage.  That keeps the engine at a constant, optimal RPM."
MachinePorn,2dygzx,GavChap,1 point,Tue Aug 19 12:19:47 2014 UTC,I'm wondering as well!
MachinePorn,2dygzx,h0uz3_,18,Tue Aug 19 09:35:26 2014 UTC,This isn't the cvt transmission. It's the motor for the hybrid drive.
MachinePorn,2dygzx,oldaccount,1 point,Tue Aug 19 09:48:33 2014 UTC,The CVT is in between the two electrical motors.
MachinePorn,2dygzx,HAL-42b,15,Tue Aug 19 09:54:12 2014 UTC,"Not really, that is just the planetary gear set. The way the engine and the two motor-generators are connected plus the computer that controls it all allows the whole assembly to act as a CVT.   At 40+ MPH both the engine and MG2 are providing power at a fairly constant rate and MG1 controls the final drive speed by varying the amount of electricity it send to the battery."
MachinePorn,2dygzx,TheBrokenWorld,4,Tue Aug 19 11:46:48 2014 UTC,The electric motors and the planetary gears together form a differential with a continuously variable ratio. The gear set set in itself is not variable.
MachinePorn,2dygzx,GavChap,2,Tue Aug 19 12:43:22 2014 UTC,"The gear ratio isn't variable, the speed is. To me, that still qualifies it as a CVT, but I think what GavChap is saying is that this transmission doesn't have any way to vary torque other than to vary the output from the two motors."
MachinePorn,2dygzx,HAL-42b,2,Tue Aug 19 17:22:05 2014 UTC,Ohhhh. OK

MachinePorn,2dygzx,minichado,4,Tue Aug 19 16:40:53 2014 UTC,"They are more complex and, as a result, more expensive than even an automatic transmission. Because they are more complex they are more expensive to repair so if anything major starts to go it's usually cheaper/better to buy a new one (see #1) There are usually friction driven connections in cvts which results in wear and a finite lifespan shorter than an automatic transmission.1  Think of it like a clutch, but instead of being on the order of hundreds of dollars to replace its on the order of thousands.   Given 1-3, in most cases the advantages that a cvt gives you doesn't out way the risk/cost of owning one.  They are usually only used in situations where efficiency is the highest design criteria.  For example, wind turbines use them.  1 This is an educated guess.  I'm a mechanical engineer, but have never worked with/designed cvts."

MachinePorn,2dygzx,Pariel,1 point,Tue Aug 19 18:05:11 2014 UTC,"The older designs for CVTs couldn't handle a lot of power but there are recent advancements that are allowing them to do quite a bit. Just like with electric cars, advancements had to be made to make them as efficient as other methods that do the same type of things. When things don't catch on quickly they are shelved and their opponent methods are used instead. A new CVT called NuVinci is getting a lot of ground because it is simple and apparently can run with any kind of loads you throw at it: http://www.overdriveonline.com/allison-to-produce-gearless-transmissions/"

For some of the more recent Ford engines, they don't even sell parts for independents to rebuild the engine. (The view is that it's just better to sell complete short/long blocks, etc.)  For that matter, I had somebody tell me that just yesterday about something as simple as a garage door opener. At $200 to repair or $300 to replace, it's harder and harder to justify the repair on economic grounds."
MachinePorn,2dygzx,nschubach,1 point,Tue Aug 19 12:57:09 2014 UTC,People couldn't get used to and grasp the concept of a transmission that didn't shift. For passenger vehicles cvt's can be made smaller and lighter than automatics.
MachinePorn,2dygzx,Pariel,-2,Tue Aug 19 13:20:55 2014 UTC,"For someone called corvettecrazy I would be curious if you've driven a CVT vehicle... Maybe it was wrongly tuned, but when I had a loaner that was a CVT, I got out on the highway and hit the gas to have the engine wind up for nothing fun to happen.  I wasn't pushed back in my seat and it didn't feel like I wanted when I pushed the pedal.  I just felt like I was burning gas for no real benefit."
MachinePorn,2dygzx,FrenchFryCattaneo,5,Tue Aug 19 13:30:54 2014 UTC,"There is noticeable lag with a CVT (I own a 2011 Outback with one).  You get used to it, and I honestly couldn't tell you how long the lag is (fractions of a second).  But if it's lacking power that's the engine, not the transmission.  As others have said, they're more common on economy cars, which tend to have relatively low power-to-weight."
MachinePorn,2dygzx,mschaef,1 point,Tue Aug 19 11:40:38 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't say they didn't catch on, many cars are produced every year with them. They just aren't as practical as a simple traditional transmission especially with more power so you pretty much only see them on econoboxes."
MachinePorn,2dygzx,GSpotAssassin,0,Tue Aug 19 12:02:09 2014 UTC,"They aren't completely mainstream, but they're more common than you might think: Nissan, Chrysler, and Subaru all currently make CVT transmission cars.  That said, they're fighting an uphill battle. Under high load, a CVT will keep the engine at its peak, optimal engine speed. This sounds odd, and a little off-putting to drivers used to engines that continually vary in speed. Some CVT's actually simulate conventional shift points to a degree, so that they sound more 'normal' and have slightly better drivability. There have also been reliability issues. My impression from the research I've done is that they're mechanically very simple in terms of the number of parts, but they're complex to get working right. (eg: hydraulic pressures can be over 2K psi, etc.)  Combine that with advances in the field of conventional automatics, dual-clutch gear boxes, and hybrid drivetrains, CVT's have lots of competition. My guess is that they're do best in the long run as a cheaper, low end option for cars with a high focus on fuel economy."

Towards the end one of the guys actually dragged it out into the main shop and attached it to one of the lift arms from a car in the air and did pullups on it.   After that I was told you better put em back before someone breaks something, but anyways these things are really pretty neat. They're very simple and it looks like other than a short in a coil or something there's not much that can go wrong.

China basically ruined all other mining operations for rare earth elements, and then cut off the shipments. Luckily mines are opening back up for neo, but dysprosium, which is much more rare and difficult, has not been found in large quantities outside of China. Dysprosium is needed in neo magnets to hold magnetic charge when the magnet gets warm. SmCo magnets are better at higher temperatures, but are not as strong.   I don't know much about lanthanum, because magnetics is my industry. But for an example of the crisis we face: china jacked up the cost of neo 800% for a few years. All aircraft and most smart weapons use neo, and we are at the total mercy of China. Think on that for a second.

It really gives an idea as of how heavy this thing is. Either that or the two flexures are used to preload each other.   Here the flexures are referred to as blade springs. Assembly detail here.  It seems there were several competing designs for the suspension system.

The tractor almost certainly produces more hp and torque, as well as being 50-60+ tons lighter.  Assuming that that tractor weighs 5 tons (which is probably an overestimate) and assuming 4500 HP (to again be on the safe side), that thing puts out 900 HP/T. By comparison, a modern M1 Abrams puts out 1500 HP and weighs 68 tons, for a paltry 22 HP/T.  I get the feeling the tank would be demolished.  On the other hand, the tank can also just shoot the tractor, so I think it wins by default. High explosives win again!  Edit: I want to see it against a sled with one of these things: RS-24 (SSME). 186000 HP/T!"

MachinePorn,2dqyy3,jutct,6,Sun Aug 17 02:00:53 2014 UTC,HP is great and all but if you are trying to pull something heavy you want torque then horsepower. Do you happen to have an estimate on the torque rating?
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,gingi_chipmunk,5,Sat Aug 16 23:00:52 2014 UTC,I'm kicking myself now for not asking. I just saw the engines and my first thought was horsepower.
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,jutct,1 point,Sat Aug 16 23:02:21 2014 UTC,I guess i am weird because my first thought for large engines is what kind of torque can that thing put out. Maybe it is because I deal with vehicles that push and pull 747s around all day.
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,jutct,1 point,Sun Aug 17 04:35:46 2014 UTC,You're actually correct. Horsepower is a function of torque. They are directly correlated.
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,atomicthumbs,4,Sun Aug 17 11:56:30 2014 UTC,HP is work done over time. (T x RPM) /5250 = HP  If we guess they run around 7000 RPM we can figure it out. By my math it's around 3750 ft lbs. Divided by three it's 1250 ft lbs per engine.
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,imautoparts,2,Sun Aug 17 02:36:47 2014 UTC,That is actually pretty good.
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,gdnws,6,Sun Aug 17 04:38:32 2014 UTC,"No, you need horsepower. You can make as much torque as you want with the proper gearing."
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,ziryra,3,Sun Aug 17 00:50:35 2014 UTC,"Yes you are right. The most powerful tractors in tractor pulling use helicopter turbines, which have very low torque (but insanely high RPM)."
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,W123133,-5,Sun Aug 17 08:02:21 2014 UTC,No not really. You can multiply torque to a point but without the engine producing a certain amount of torque you aren't going to get what you want. It really is a balance between the two and finding that balance is the constant challenge in todays market.
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,dutchbag,2,Sun Aug 17 04:34:03 2014 UTC,You don't seem to understand what torque and horsepower are. Horsepower is torque plus how fast that torque can be applied.
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,Perryn,0,Sun Aug 17 21:37:05 2014 UTC,"Do you understand what torque is? Torque is the force x the length of the lever     T=FxL lb/ft  If you are using the standard measurements, if you are using metric then it come out to nm (newton meters).   One imperial horsepower is about 550 lb/ft per second or 746 watts."
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,W123133,1 point,Mon Aug 18 02:15:14 2014 UTC,"You just confirmed exactly what I said. Torque is useless without a comparable horsepower measure. You can have 1 billion lb/ft of torque, but moving so slowly that it won't even rotate once per year. How is that useful? You need horsepower to speed it up."
MachinePorn,2dqyy3,Perryn,1 point,Mon Aug 18 14:32:14 2014 UTC,want torque then horsepower   You always want high horsepower. Horsepower is the measure of torque plus how fast that torque can be applied. You can always increase torque by gearing down and sacrificing RPM.

MachinePorn,2dlvnt,CephiDelco,14,Fri Aug 15 15:44:40 2014 UTC,"At the time, the British aerospace industry was the most advanced in the world. This means they were making a lot of Firsts, so had to be original. It's from their work that the likes of Boeing learned from and refined.  But in this case, it's a nuclear bomber. It has small windows to better survive a nearby detonation. Its engines and wings are designed to deal with the shockwaves. Etc."
MachinePorn,2dlvnt,listyraesder,1 point,Fri Aug 15 18:08:39 2014 UTC,"It is true that the British were jet pioneers... I guess that technology was pushed by the war.  I think I may have been speaking out of the stereotype that British engineering = unnecessarily complicated.  I think maybe this might have come from their auto design. (?)  But yea, whatever the reason the Victor is one wildass looking aircraft.  Guess its no wilder than the F-117 or B-2, but it is obvious as to why those look the way they look."

MachinePorn,2dlvnt,scarabeetle101,4,Fri Aug 15 17:31:13 2014 UTC,"Not entirely sure why you got down voted as it's a good question to ask.  If you're trying to suggest American jet's are less complicated... well funny story.  Sometime in the 1970's, the soviet union built the MiG-25 which was from the outside a fairly scary interceptor as it was extremely fast and it seemed to have a tight angle of attack ( how fast you can turn ).  This freaked out the US and it's allies so the F-15 was built.    Now there's nothing too wrong about the F-15 ( I worked for several years with F-15 squadron's ) but it was beefed up tremendously to act as a counter to the MiG-25.  When a soviet pilot defected with his MiG-25 to Japan ( ultimately to the USA ), aerospace engineers got their hands on the airplane and they realized how insanely simple it was ( just some really powerful turbines and a lot less over-engineering ).  Defecting pilot basic w/story- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Belenko   Meanwhile there's the abomination F-22.  It's really cool but insanely expensive and complicated.  Made worse by the fact that it has to fit the needs of the USAF, USN, and USMC who have overlapping but also unique mission parameters. (Edit - lumped the F-35 and F-22 together in my mind).  Additionally, this movie The Pentagon Wars https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F8zVyv3t1U does a disturbingly good job explaining how military equipment programs get screwed up, real fast."
MachinePorn,2dlvnt,zynix,6,Fri Aug 15 17:55:36 2014 UTC,"I love the mig-25.  How fast will it go? Well, we got it up to mach 2.8 and the engines went so fast they ate themselves (Tumansky R-15, sounds so SciFi).  Well how's it handle? Don't turn at speed, the airframe will survive...just more u-shaped.  Airframe? Well titanium is expensive, so let's just make it from steel.  Avionics? Open box, vacuum tubes and turnips fall out."

Our designers have consistently come up with things that look like they're from the future (see: the TSR-2, Concorde, every Aston Martin ever). We're also very good at scrapping things without having much idea of why or how we'll replace them.   Some history: the Valiant was quickly retired because it was never intended to serve for much longer than it would take to get the Victor into service, the Victor was a great high-altitude bomber but was ill-suited to low-level penetration and so was basically doomed by circumstance (they were eventually turned into strategic reconnaissance jets and then tankers, eventually retiring in 1993), and the Vulcan turned out to be overall really good (particularly in the low level role) and flew as a bomber and marine recon plane until the mid-80s."

They got the letter in saying ""design the fastest aeroplane ever, it has to stop a nuclear bomber at 60,000ft in three minutes or less"" and then ticked exactly that box, as conservatively and carefully as anyone pursuing such an insane goal can. Swept-but-not-delta wings, conventional tail surfaces, truly weird nose intake rather than s-ducts, etc - compare it to the TSR-2 ten years later and it's like they're almost from different centuries (though in fairness those ten years were probably the biggest leap since designs swung away from biplanes, so...)  Not that Lightnings aren't amazing, mind."

Teeth are offset to reduce non-uniform stress on gear teeth. Later engineering solved this problem with double helical (herringbone) gears."
MachinePorn,2djkk1,Giacomo_iron_chef,2,Thu Aug 14 15:52:30 2014 UTC,It could be to prevent or reduce gear lash as well.
MachinePorn,2djkk1,Antiquus,3,Thu Aug 14 16:41:07 2014 UTC,"Double helicals are in modern usage separated by a band of space - a function of the equipment used to make them now. You don't see them often as they are expensive to make, all the ones I've worked on went into aircraft. Herringbones are understood to mean the gear teeth meet in the middle - an obsolete design needing a lot of hand work where they meet.   Not only do you eliminate non-uniform stress with a double helical, but also the end thrusts of the helicals cancel each other out and double helicals are self centering."
MachinePorn,2djkk1,Realworld,2,Thu Aug 14 22:12:50 2014 UTC,"Was wondering about manufacturing practicalities of herringbone gears; a double helical / band of space makes sense, and keeps the end thrust balanced. Hadn't thought of self-centering advantage."

In the case of the F135 engine and the F119 engine for the F-22 (which the F135 was derived from), the engine internals have actually also been designed to reduce radar signature.  What that entails isn't fully known, but at least one public feature is that both engines do not have conventional spray-bars / flame holders (that's from an F110 engine) used to perform afterburner.

MachinePorn,2dc0ko,lpvishnu,3,Tue Aug 12 17:20:01 2014 UTC,No most modern vessels are diesel-electric or use gas turbines.  My ship is old and uses turbines.
MachinePorn,2dc0ko,Rangourthaman_,3,Tue Aug 12 17:22:25 2014 UTC,"I don't know the specifics of this turbine, but I've seen some (single-flow) main steam HP turbines for electric power generation that operate at 1000 F and 2400 PSI.

MachinePorn,2dc0ko,tamman2000,1 point,Wed Aug 13 04:17:31 2014 UTC,"For turning a generator @ 50 or 60Hz.  The main advantage of this type of rotor design vs a unidirectional flow is that there is very little thrust load to deal with. Thrust bearings and loading can be a pain in the ass sometimes, so eliminating this requirement makes the rotor easier to set up initially and less downtime adjusting thrust in the future. The downside is that you need to collect steam on both ends which necessitates two heavy  exhaust scrolls, making the unit heavier and more expensive."
MachinePorn,2dc0ko,Avilator,5,Tue Aug 12 18:29:11 2014 UTC,I take it the high pressure air/steam(?) gets in from both sides and gets collected in the middle?
MachinePorn,2dc0ko,tamman2000,39,Tue Aug 12 15:14:23 2014 UTC,"Quite the opposite! The steam enters in the middle of the shaft, and exits at each end, balancing the axial force. Reducing the need for very heavy duty thrust bearings on on side."

MachinePorn,2d9k7q,ANAL_ANARCHY,7,Mon Aug 11 23:33:02 2014 UTC,"I used to work at an airport and we had this guy coming in for a while who worked for the power company pulling power lines through new poles. While the job was different the flight pattern he was flying is very similar to what this pilot does all day. One of the days he was working he fueled up 22 times. It wasn't much fuel every time, he was fueling up while the ground crew set up his next line, but at the end of the day the bill was in the neighborhood of $800, around 120-130 gallons. Way cheaper than having it done by hand. This guy did 8 miles for a few grand a day, where a ground crew would cost almost as much and only do a fraction of that distance."
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,caughdog,6,Tue Aug 12 00:01:35 2014 UTC,I used to do estimation for similar clearing work.   Holy god the savings.
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,Cubejam,3,Tue Aug 12 00:42:53 2014 UTC,$800 to fuel a helicopter for a whole day is really cheap too.

MachinePorn,2d9k7q,cyberst0rm,17,Mon Aug 11 20:49:41 2014 UTC,The lead attaching it to the helicopter is solid (pipe perhaps?). Watch the video in the comments and you can see it is rigid.
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,chriszuma,6,Mon Aug 11 21:09:42 2014 UTC,It could even be a hose filled with fluid that gets pressurized when they take off
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,everylittlebitcounts,16,Mon Aug 11 23:13:32 2014 UTC,liquids under pressure generally don't stop torque.
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,silentkill144,10,Tue Aug 12 01:22:50 2014 UTC,"No, but rigid walled beams do. In any case it would be silly and much heavier."
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,everylittlebitcounts,5,Tue Aug 12 01:34:21 2014 UTC,Spin the saw blades in opposing directions? I would think this would negate the gyroscopic effect and keep it somewhat steady. Just a guess.
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,mck1117,3,Mon Aug 11 23:40:22 2014 UTC,Wouldn't you want the gyroscopic effect to help keep it stationary?
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,everylittlebitcounts,6,Tue Aug 12 01:53:12 2014 UTC,"The way all the saw blades are facing the same direction would mean they would all try to torque the entire assembly along the shaft/rope/thing that connects to helicopter, like a gyroscope on a string, and if there is equal number of blades spinning in opposing directions my theory is that they should all cancel out each other's torque forces."
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,nill0c,2,Tue Aug 12 04:02:00 2014 UTC,But you want it to turn with the helicopter so that the blades point front/back.  That would mean that the blades stay oriented the same way if you decide you want to cut in a different direction.
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,silentkill144,1 point,Tue Aug 12 05:51:24 2014 UTC,Yea exactly and if all the blades are rotating say clockwise then this will happen which would mean it wouldn't stay oriented so I'm saying that one possible solution would be to have half the blades spin clockwise and half the blades spin counter clockwise so they cancel each other out.
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,everylittlebitcounts,1 point,Tue Aug 12 11:37:38 2014 UTC,This is correct! Also you could vary the speeds of some of the blades to steer the whole assembly. This is essentially how quad copters fly.
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,silentkill144,1 point,Tue Aug 12 14:22:31 2014 UTC,"Yes, but if you loose the gyroscopic stabilization, wouldn't it be a lot easier for the blade assembly to spin in a direction that will not cut the trees."
MachinePorn,2d9k7q,everylittlebitcounts,1 point,Wed Aug 13 00:39:07 2014 UTC,The stabilization created by the gyroscopic effect will not keep it pointed along the same path but would make the entire assembly spin around the pole which would be counter intuitive.

I can't remember the model, but I do know that he was running 600+ Horsepower in a plane only slightly larger than a Cessna 172. As a kid I would watch him dust. He would do a row and then fly straight up. He would reach a certain level, kick his rudder hard over, Flip end for end in the air, fly straight down toward the ground, and then flare out perfectly lined up for the next row.  This is a maneuver called the ""Hammerhead stall"". Most pilots only do it a few times, if at all. A bush pilot might use it in an emergency if they've accidentally flown into a box canyon. And they usually have plenty of altitude just in case. This guy did it all. Day. Long. With 30' tops of wiggle room."

I'd seen the slug before but the cbs report was the first I'd seen of the dart variant I wonder why their are two different rounds.  It would actually be pretty easy to calculate the kinetic energy of the dart I would say it probably weighs maybe 30lbs (13.6kg) based on how it is being handled then at mach 7 (2382.03 m / s) (maximum muzzle velocity is probably more that just the released speed.

MachinePorn,2d4zys,testmypatience,1 point,Mon Aug 11 01:02:02 2014 UTC,"5800m/s on future models   That's mach 17. The range would be 1000 nmi (+/-). I don't think that's suitable for warships. Even if you could fit (and afford) one on a ship, it'd make more sense to build them on overseas bases--it's easier/cheaper, and you'd still be able to hit everything.  228 MJ isn't that much. A Nimitz's catapult delivers 95 MJ; EMALS 122 MJ."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,Occamslaser,17,Fri Aug 15 22:02:48 2014 UTC,I'm curious how they have gotten around the rails being melted problem. It's much like an stick welder striking a line down a piece of metal. How do they get around this issue? I have a theory that they could cool the rails by making the rails piping and running water through them although that may create flash steam and create a whole other set of problems. Ideas on how they solve this problem if they actually have solved it at all?
MachinePorn,2d4zys,Chadman108,6,Sun Aug 10 17:18:53 2014 UTC,no idea why you are being down voted. Last i heard they are constantly having to replace the rails in the lab and have not solved the issue.  However this is still in testing as they said who knows if they have or have not solved it yet or if they ever will.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,testmypatience,11,Sun Aug 10 18:04:08 2014 UTC,It's all top secret but from what I have seen in armchair general forums they are using some sort of magnetic effect to keep the round from actually touching the rail except for specific controlled points.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,testmypatience,2,Sun Aug 10 18:04:47 2014 UTC,From the round they show in the videos it looks like it would have to contact something. Would there be any way that two metal contacts could stay contacted without leaving a melt trail? Someone said something about dielectric grease but dielectric grease does not conduct electricity and is used to prevent corrosion. It seems two companies are building large versions usable for military usage. I assume they could perhaps float it using magnetic fields but not sure how they would accomplish this while keeping contact to provide the thrust. It seems that the method of use for a rail-gun requires contact of the projectile with the rails. It also seems that the back of the projectile is the armature that is u-shaped and is discarded at the end of the rail as well as the casing that holds the projectile.   Hm...
MachinePorn,2d4zys,testmypatience,5,Sun Aug 10 21:25:43 2014 UTC,It's an aluminum sabot if I remember correctly with a tungsten dart.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,l1ghtning,1 point,Sun Aug 10 21:45:55 2014 UTC,Yeah I was gonna say I could have sworn I saw a sabot leave the spike after it exited the barrel.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,testmypatience,0,Sun Aug 10 23:57:47 2014 UTC,I know there is a sabot. That doesn't really answer how it doesn't leave the rail with issues. The sabot is just to get it to go down the rails without wobbling funny as far as I can tell. The back part of the thing is what they said causes it to fire down the rail. The armature they call it. So how it connects without leaving the rails in need of repair is the question.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,gaddra,1 point,Mon Aug 11 01:20:02 2014 UTC,Yes. The armature is what the Lorentz force is acting on. The question however is how to not get the plasma that is created by the electricity flowing through the armature to not fry the rails out of usable condition.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,randomfact8472,1 point,Fri Aug 15 02:59:43 2014 UTC,Could you point me to documentation saying this? I was told for a long time that the rails getting scorched from the plasma arc was a big reason rail guns were not an idea that most would go and try to use. Coil guns on the other hand are extremely easy to operate and not have fucked up rails or barrel since it uses magnetic forces in coils versus a setup that torches the rail as the projectile shoots out of the barrel.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,testmypatience,3,Fri Aug 15 03:01:48 2014 UTC,"It could use a plasma (an arc) as a ""conductor"" on either side of the sabot. The rails could then be iridium/osmium coated copper which would offer excellent resistance to the plasma temperatures and also fantastic heat dissipation via the bulk copper. But what would I know."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,jaqq,0,Fri Aug 15 03:03:30 2014 UTC,That sounds like a reasonable concept. How much heat can those coatings take?
MachinePorn,2d4zys,Upward_Spiral,1 point,Fri Aug 15 03:10:13 2014 UTC,That makes no sense. The core idea behind a railgun requires a continually flowing current. Otherwise you just have dead zones which would serve no purpose but to increase losses.

MachinePorn,2d4zys,Ographer,-1,Tue Aug 12 18:01:10 2014 UTC,Corrosion of the rails? How is the plasma connection made? I'm guessing just small gaps between the armature and the rails so it will jump the gap to the armature. Why is heating not the issue considering it is what causes the rail to get metal scarring along the surface that the electricity jumped to the armature? I'm guessing that plasma would end up causing more heat scarring issues on the surface of the rail than if the metal was touching surfaces.

MachinePorn,2d4zys,TheNeckbeardCrusader,3,Sun Aug 10 15:57:44 2014 UTC,"You might be surprised. Compared to the Harpoon missile the railgun shot is expected to go at least twice as far and ten times as fast. $25,000 vs $2,000,000 is  steal.   The Harpoon flies just above the sea and I assume the Railgun would have to follow a ballistic trajectory.  But there would hardly be enough time for the target to prepare countermeasures for the railgun shot."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,robotnikman,6,Sun Aug 10 17:04:09 2014 UTC,At mach 7 it's traveling 1.5 miles per second and reportedly will have onboard flight correction. Not much chance of dodging it.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,l1ghtning,6,Sun Aug 10 16:15:27 2014 UTC,"While technically it does have a ballistic trajectory, when you're hauling ass at that speed, the actual arc is pretty minimal."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,Upward_Spiral,1 point,Sun Aug 10 17:24:05 2014 UTC,"I completely agree, twenty five grand for a single shell is eye watering. Even with modern targeting systems, I don't think there's any way an unguided projectile could be as accurate as a missile, especially over the horizon.   Missiles carry a payload as well, and at the moment I believe that railguns are just firing slugs with kinetic potential only."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,956,3,Sun Aug 10 19:19:33 2014 UTC,"To be fair, its kinetic potential is more than half the energy of the same mass of TNT. What fraction of a typical shell is TNT? And the energy per unit volume is higher than it would be if you replaced some of the metal with TNT."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,l1ghtning,2,Sun Aug 10 19:46:36 2014 UTC,"While you are correct about TNT, an important thing to consider is that as the slugs are effectively solid tungsten, and moving at very high velocity, their ability to ""squash,"" and transfer a majority of their energy into a target is severely diminished. As you probably noticed in some of the videos posted above, the round travelling at 15k m/s passes through 8 centimeters (inches?) of steel like it isn't there. As modern surface warships are ""soft,"" ie: have very little armor worth mentioning, there's a good chance that a round could punch through an entire vessel, which is wasteful in terms of destructive potential.   There are also several much more energetic explosives available than TNT that would make more sense. An effective alternative to a warhead might also be a superheated jet of liquid metal, but that's total speculation, and probably outside the realm of technical possibility at the moment."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,FoodBeerBikesMusic,3,Sun Aug 10 20:59:33 2014 UTC,I'd still rather not be on a warship that has a couple of holes punched clean through it.  I'd put the odds of the shell missing all important systems to be roughly equivalent of hitting a golf ball through a tree.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,iamDa3dalus,4,Sun Aug 10 19:40:45 2014 UTC,"I'm not disparaging the seriousness of a boat having holes in it. What you might consider, though, is that a for the price of a missile that can single handedly cripple a warship, you're putting eight, four inch diameter holes (if all of them impact) in a ship that is likely both heavily compartmentalized, and many hundreds of feet long. The same ship also has redundancies in many, if not all of it's systems.    I'd put the odds of the shell missing all important systems to be roughly equivalent of hitting a golf ball through a tree.   If what I think you're saying is correct, then why leave it to chance? If shells detonated/disintegrated upon impact they would definitely damage critical systems, not probably damage critical systems.   In reality, I'm not really qualified to make speculations about the relative cost effectiveness/damage potential of weapons systems. There's a lot of arm chair expertise going on."

So it would be a while before it could be mounted compact land based platform like a tank.  This is why the new navy ships have been designed with so much generating capacity.  To make it work on a tank sized platform you would need a generator, the turbine of a M1 would do ok at this, but then you would also need to store the energy and store enough of it that you could fire a number of shots in rapid succession.  The most likely potential land based deployment would be similar to artillery as it would need at least one other vehicle in addition to the one it is mounted on to carry the generating capacity it would need to operate.  edit:spelling"

MachinePorn,2d4zys,0_0_0,1 point,Sun Aug 10 20:12:29 2014 UTC,Its accelerated along the rails. A single pulse would be one of loading [discharge] of energy.  Accelerating along rails means that the energy has to be maintained over a t function. This is why they are using special built capacitors rather than off then generic capacitors.  They will also have to recharge extremely quickly as they want to achieve a fire rate of 1 round every 6 seconds.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,primordialblob,1 point,Sun Aug 10 17:58:55 2014 UTC,"Charging capacitors can be very quick. It depends on your power source and capacitance. Going by other comments on this thread - if you want to fire a round every 6 seconds and give it 40MJ of electrical energy it would take 8,000,000 watts of power to provide that much energy every 6 seconds - I don't imagine your railgun was operating at those kind of powers, I'd guess maybe a few kilojoules at most. Whole different kettle of fish.   Also, off the shelf capacitors probably could provide that much current - you'd just need a hell of a lot of them to do it."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,roboticWanderor,1 point,Sun Aug 10 12:19:29 2014 UTC,"the main issue with putting one on a vehicle is power supply... So it would be a while before it could be mounted compact land based platform like a tank.   Well... not THAT long of a while. The Army actually did a fair amount of research into a railgun-armed tank. They never quite got it compact and light enough for an MBT, but for ship-based gunnery it's plenty light and small. An operational naval railgun would probably borrow quite a bit from the Army's research, particularly the compulsators (the power supply).  The amount of stored energy is actually pretty modest and is easily stored, not so much the power supply and auxiliary equipment."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,jokoon,0,Sun Aug 10 12:29:00 2014 UTC,"That's what I don't understand about railguns... what's the point? It's a clever way to weaponize electricity, but good, old-fashioned gunpowder stores just as much energy in the more versatile chemical form."

MachinePorn,2d4zys,uberyeti,1 point,Sun Aug 10 15:02:00 2014 UTC,The round uses internal guidance so it could in theory use its fins to maintain a flat trajectory but this would require it to bleed its velocity.  Its just better if it uses a ballistic trajectory as opposed to flat one.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,SP-Sandbag,1 point,Sun Aug 10 19:25:45 2014 UTC,"Indeed plus for the ranges they are planning for this gun a ballistic trajectory makes sense. During testing they claim they where having trouble keeping the range down even with the crappy non-aerodynamic version of the projectile. If they want to test full-range, aerodynamic ballistic shots they better be really out there (probably one of the many reasons to get it quickly on a test vessel).  This is building up to be an amazing weapon. It can hit sea and air targets, has a high rate of fire, they can carry tons of it. This thing could be knocking out anti-ship missiles out of the air while peppering enemy ships with a barrage of hard to stop darts."

MachinePorn,2d4zys,Occamslaser,2,Fri Aug 15 21:06:10 2014 UTC,They seem to be taking a general purpose approach to this saying it will do a little of everything but most importantly is its ability to provide direct fire highly accurate ground support.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,Thornaxe,2,Sun Aug 10 22:05:14 2014 UTC,"Smaller version would probably make an excellent AA gun with how fast the shell travels, it wouldn't have too hard of a time with fast moving targets, provided that its on a proper mount. Probably wouldn't replace AA missiles, but would be a much cheaper alternative which complements them and performs multiple other roles"
MachinePorn,2d4zys,neomagtyler,1 point,Sun Aug 10 17:50:04 2014 UTC,"I guess it's like a replacement for the old 5"" guns, which had an all-around sorta goal of shooting at both land and air targets while being specialised for neither."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,trainspotting2,1 point,Mon Aug 11 01:07:13 2014 UTC,"Rail guns down scale down very well. The math is complicated as hell but the tl;dr is that a lot of the parts have to be the same size regardless of whether they are on a massive railgun or a small one. Rail gun range and velocity is also related to the square of the length of the barrel, so cutting the barrel in half to fit into an AA mount would cut the range and speed of the round to 1/4th the original."
MachinePorn,2d4zys,TheSelfGoverned,1 point,Mon Aug 11 01:45:45 2014 UTC,"Probably would be great as an inexpensive antiaircraft weapon as well. One of the reasons large caliber flak guns are no longer used (except on naval vessels) is because by the time the shell reached the altitude of the aircraft being targeted it would already be gone. Because of the large window between the shell reaching the altitude of the aircraft was so big, firing ahead or 'leading the target' just wasn't possible at the aircraft could easily move out of the way  With how fast the shell from a railgun travels, it would mostly negate this disadvantage, and combined with a proximity fuse it would be a cheap and probably efficient weapon against aircraft, especially when you consider they would probably be used in batteries of 4 or more on land. Also would be a nasty surprise for any tank which got too close as well"
MachinePorn,2d4zys,AliasUndercover,1 point,Sun Aug 10 16:40:23 2014 UTC,"Yes, these could be useful for short-range air defence on land but at sea they'd be useless. Air combat simply doesn't happen at close enough ranges for guns any more. If aircraft were attacking ships they'd do it from hundreds of kilometres away, well over the horizon, with cruise missiles. There's nothing to hide behind at sea and guns are of little value against moving targets at extreme range, whereas on land aircraft can get much closer to you by hiding behind terrain before they become visible.  To put a little perspective on the railgun's muzzle velocity, the APFSDS shell from a modern 120mm NATO gun is fired at 1,500 to 1,600 m/s. The railguns so far demonstrated can increase that by 50%. They could double it in further generations, I think. Now, even at those speeds a tank shell takes about two seconds to travel to maximum range (~3000m), meaning they must lead their targets quite significantly even when firing at other vehicles moving at 50 kph. Now an aircraft can travel twenty times faster, and do it while jinking and weaving. You could feasibly use railguns for point defence, but for medium range work missiles would still, I believe, be king. And I'm not convinced that railguns would do the job better than rapid fire autocannon and short-range SAMs that we currently use.  but they would be freaking cool"
MachinePorn,2d4zys,Thornaxe,1 point,Sun Aug 10 20:03:54 2014 UTC,The problem looks like the railgun projectiles punch through everything like an icepick.  http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/us-navy-unveils-high-speed-rail-gun/  Someone posted this video: the projectiles go through concrete and steel and don't appear to actually destroy anything.
MachinePorn,2d4zys,Douglust_Quaids,8,Sun Aug 10 21:28:41 2014 UTC,"That's just because those are the targets. If the target is a tank with some actual mass to stop the rod, then the energy of the round starts to do something."

Almost everything that has carried their name have been stunning works of art as well as functional machines. They didn't sacrifice aesthetics in the name of speed. They found a way to make the two synonymous.   I love Lamborghini and they look, sound, and perform like the amazing machines they are. Ferrari however just has that extra something that makes their machines sexy as hell on top of having the performance.   It's a shame that Ferrari has not been on the sharp end of the F1 field for the last few years. If they didn't have Fernando Alonso they would be much farther down the field. His super human ability to get more from a car than anyone else has kept them looking somewhat competitive when they really aren't. If Alonso had been on a team with a good car he would have a few of Sebastian Vettel's world championships. The fact that he almost got it a couple of years ago in a terrible car just shows his ability.   Ferrari is just on another level when it comes to functional design."

I remember seeing a show when I was younger saying that if anything ever happened to one of our 100,000ton aircraft carriers that disabled it similarly, there are contingency plans to use both the Blue Marlin and Black Marlin(Sister ship) to lift it out of the water and take it back to the United States in tandem. But since that's obviously very dangerous and very slow, we just try to make it a point not to let that happen to our carriers. As for stability, she would remain stable using the same methods all very large ships do. Stabilizers, ballast tanks, and  routes that only use the most calm seas. She's probably also flat bottomed, which just adds to that stability."

I believe it's the venturi effect (bernoulli's principle. thanks /u/VTMech) , but it might be another hydrodynamic principle. effectively, blowing air in one direction causes the air around that air to move as well, because it gets dragged along creates a low pressure area. The huge amount of gases that rocket is ejecting is dragging air along with it as it leaves.  and psst... That rocket isn't being launched, just run on a stand."

The HTP decomposes violently (exothermically!) like this: 2H2O2(l) -> 2H2O(g) + O2(g) which then reacts (burns like hell) with the solid fuel to add a whole f**kton more enthalpy to the mixture, which then gets ejected from the nozzle at a rate that might best be described as ""fast"".

MachinePorn,2cpras,Ken-the-pilot,2,Tue Aug 5 19:13:42 2014 UTC,"The Pennsylvania Railroad's I1 Class were the largest 2-10-0 ""decapod"" type locomotives ever built in the United States. With a tractive effort of between 90000 and 96000 pounds depending on the model, the locomotive was designed specifically by the Pennsy, for the Pennsy, who needed an engine for heavy drag freights (low speed, high tonnage loads like coal) through Pennsylvania and around the Great Lakes. However, the I1s were considered a nightmare by their crews as they were rough-riding and their small driving wheels and lack of counterweights made them prone to slipping. Despite this, almost 600 would be built between 1916-1923 and would remain in service as one of the more dominant freight locomotives until the railroad ended all steam operations in 1957.  This website is where I got the image from. It has tons of pictures from the PRR's Altoona Works throughout the era of steam and into today as the area is still being used by the Norfolk Southern Railroad.  EDIT: words"

MachinePorn,2co0mc,iwancoppa,5,Tue Aug 5 13:07:25 2014 UTC,Truthfully this is hardly different from a helicopter in the basic concept - a turbine engine powering a set of blades that provide lift.
MachinePorn,2co0mc,oldaccount,7,Tue Aug 5 13:30:35 2014 UTC,"Ask any pilot of a VTOL aircraft and they will tell it it is nothing like flying a helicopter. They both can takeoff vertically, but the physical behavior of having thrust under you is completely different than hanging from a rotor."

MachinePorn,2co0mc,subhumann,2,Tue Aug 5 16:02:05 2014 UTC,The flying aspect too. Remember that a helicopter has a powerful tail rotor - in the harrier or any jet VTOL there is no such device so yaw becomes critical - they actually fitted rudder shakers to the harrier to stop pilots from tipping them over in gusts etc. It's nothing like a helicopter at all  more info for anyone interested: http://www.pprune.org/archive/index.php/t-339323.html

MachinePorn,2cm4dr,captainJmorgan,10,Mon Aug 4 22:00:38 2014 UTC,I believe the electromagnetic launch is just easier to maintain and more efficient than the steam version. You're still going to have parts that break. You still have massive chunks of metal hauling an aircraft across the deck that will need maintenance.
MachinePorn,2cm4dr,dewknight,8,Mon Aug 4 22:10:52 2014 UTC,"Of course.   Electronics are cheaper too, and easier to swap than freaking Pistons.  Also it won't heat up like steam powered"
MachinePorn,2cm4dr,captainJmorgan,5,Mon Aug 4 22:30:58 2014 UTC,indeed. Plus you have whole areas that don't need to be dedicated to holding steam anymore.

MachinePorn,2cm4dr,changetip,1 point,Tue Aug 5 02:47:29 2014 UTC,"The big advantage of the EM catapult is that its power can be throttled to launch UAVs. The steam catapult is efficient and relatively cheap, but its settings are 'off' and '11'; it's too powerful for the lightweight composite airframe of a drone."
MachinePorn,2cm4dr,trainspotting2,2,Tue Aug 5 12:49:30 2014 UTC,"Not sure if you're correct. The pilot and catapult officer verify weights before launch, to determine the strength of the shot."
MachinePorn,2cm4dr,base935,1 point,Tue Aug 5 13:27:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I misspoke a little bit. They can adjust the pressure behind the piston, but it's the way it operates - build pressure behind the piston and release it all at once - that puts a huge amount of stress on the airframe. The electromagnetic catapult allows for more gradual acceleration so it's easier on the frame. It's a progressively-accelerating push instead of a kick in the back.  The EM catapult can also launch heavier aircraft than a steam catapult can handle."
MachinePorn,2cm4dr,trainspotting2,2,Tue Aug 5 13:42:35 2014 UTC,"I'm not a catapult officer, but my understanding is that the steam cats can slowly open their valves to gradually accelerate aircraft. My 250 cat shots felt pretty gradual. The older hydraulic cats sound like what you're talking about - instant max accel that would really fatigue metal and pilots!"
MachinePorn,2cm4dr,kwehfweh,1 point,Tue Aug 5 14:25:10 2014 UTC,"There's not really a way to accomplish that with steam; the valves open with the piston locked in place until pressure is appropriate for the aircraft, then the piston is released and it slams forward.   It's that initial release that loads the composite airframe of a drone in a way it's not designed for, and shatters it. There is an experimental UAV that can be launched from a steam catapult, but it's not clear whether that will ever see service."
MachinePorn,2cm4dr,trainspotting2,1 point,Tue Aug 5 14:52:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's more like off, and 9, 10, or 11. Still massive stress on an airframe."

MachinePorn,2cgeyf,kallekilponen,12,Sat Aug 2 23:20:37 2014 UTC,Depends on the targeting system. Modern systems can compensate for pretty much any movement the tank makes. Not sure how advanced the system on a T-90 is though...
MachinePorn,2cgeyf,TheBrokenWorld,7,Sat Aug 2 23:57:37 2014 UTC,I think the whole point of this being done was to show that the tank could actually hit a target while being driven aggressively.
MachinePorn,2cgeyf,ALoudMouthBaby,-2,Sun Aug 3 00:37:26 2014 UTC,Not in the least. There was no way the turret would be able to compensate for that rapid a movement.

MachinePorn,2cgeyf,TheBrokenWorld,2,Sun Aug 3 22:58:47 2014 UTC,"There's just nothing rapid about the movement. The target is far away, the change in angle necessary for the turret to stay on target is fairly small and slow.   If you watch this footage, you can see that there's nothing rapid about the movement of the tank until it hits the ground. Every modern tank will be designed to track its target accurately at speed on rough terrain if it's expected to be competitive."
MachinePorn,2cgeyf,ALoudMouthBaby,-2,Sun Aug 3 23:00:02 2014 UTC,"There's just nothing rapid about the movement.   Compared to the speed at which a turret can rotate there is.

MachinePorn,2cgeyf,TheBrokenWorld,2,Sun Aug 3 23:09:28 2014 UTC,"Why would jumping affect the rotation of the turret? Jumping is a vertical motion, the turret provides horizontal tracking.  Flying through the air is a smooth motion, it's hitting the ground that's rough."
MachinePorn,2cgeyf,ALoudMouthBaby,0,Sun Aug 3 23:13:55 2014 UTC,"Why would jumping affect the rotation of the turret?   Look at how the tank pitches and yaws in that video.

MachinePorn,2cgeyf,TheBrokenWorld,2,Sun Aug 3 23:39:32 2014 UTC,"It's just moving the cannon, not the turret.

Source:  Bagger 258 is a bucket wheel excavator, or ""schaufelradbagger,"" built by the heavy machinery company Lauchhammer. First put to use in East Germany in 1964, Bagger 258 was one of a series of such machines whose task was to assist in intensive mining operations.  This motorised excavator featured a total of 10 blades, cutting to a depth of 15m into the earth as it removed spoil from the layers of coal beneath. The buckets, each designed with a capacity of roughly 1,500m³, would also collect a thin layer of coal during the process.  This was sifted mechanically and diverted to feed the machine's coal-burning engines. With a length of 171.5m and reaching a height of 50m, the 3850-tonne Bagger 258 rather resembles a factory; although this factory was mounted onto tank-like tracks and able to move at a speed of six metres per minute. Bagger 258 was abandoned in 2002, for no better reason than that it had simply run out of things to dig. By this point the behemoth was showing its age, and the cost of dismantling it wasn't justified by the tired mechanisms on offer.  Instead the area around Bagger 258 was replanted, and redeveloped as a solar park. These days, Bagger 258 stands desolate in a field in Germany. Its blue paint job - now chipped and fading - had once earned it the nickname, ""Blue Wonder."""

There are so many things that can go wrong mechanically, and controlling the metallurgy is an art of it's own, so it's a wonder that these things work at all.  Richard Preston's book ""American Steel"" about Nucor's first CCM is a fantastic read, and a good primer on the subject, despite the advances in the technology since it was written.  While the technology has advanced, the challenges the technology overcomes are still the same, and are formidable."
MachinePorn,2c02wc,Lusankya,3,Tue Jul 29 15:49:38 2014 UTC,"I'm certainly not saying it's easy to maintain these machines.  I have experience with extruders ranging from food to steel, and I'm very well aware of how persnickety they are.  You're entirely right that it's a wonder they work.  Thanks for the recommendation!  I'm looking for something to read with an engineering case study bent to it.  Now to find a copy that isn't $100 on Amazon...  Fun tangent: I once saw a rubber extruder lose part of its bourrelet screw and pass it through the dye.  The controller dialed up the screw torque to compensate for the loss of pressure.  Somehow, the dye managed to warp the bit of broken screw enough to pass it out onto the line.  Nothing went out of limits, so the machine kept merrily chugging away and just put a dab of tolerance paint on the screw blade as it passed the marker.  That client now has metal detectors after the extruder, instead of only before."

MachinePorn,2c02wc,synapticrelease,2,Tue Jul 29 16:00:44 2014 UTC,"These are all steel products, and CCMs are used for all of them.  The CCMs put out various sizes of plate/billet, which are then usually reheated for hot rolling.  Usually the billet is cast and cut to length and then either cooled and stored, or conveyed to a reheat oven and then rolled on a separate line.  I've only seen one plant where it went straight from the CCM into a rolling line.  Most of the rolling lines I'm familiar with feed backwards and forwards multiple times, so this would get in the way of the next cast.    The sheet metal at Nucor's Crawfordsville, Indiana plant uses CCMs to produce plate billets around 2"" thick (if I remember correctly).  These are then reheated and rolled several times to produce the coils.  Some of these are then further cold-rolled, galvanized, etc.  I've seen rebar CCM billets cast at about 150mmx150mm, then reheated and rolled/drawn down to size.  I haven't personally seen railroad rail being produced, but I've seen promotional videos of it, and would guess the CCM billets start at about 12""x10"" and are then rolled down to size and shape."

MachinePorn,2bvngq,morcheeba,6,Sun Jul 27 19:57:03 2014 UTC,Why is the entire engine complete with the exception of one of the turbos being a cutaway?
MachinePorn,2bvngq,OGHamToast,8,Mon Jul 28 00:25:04 2014 UTC,"They're really proud of the turbo location in this engine and wanted to show it off. It's called a ""hot inside V"", where the exhaust is in the center of the engine instead of the outside. From the press release:   Biturbocharging with 'hot inside V'  Unlike the previously conventional approach, both exhaust gas turbochargers in the new M178 are located inside the 'hot inside V' configuration rather than on the outside of the cylinder banks. The advantages of this layout are that the V8 engine is considerably more compact, which enables optimum weight distribution between the front and rear axle, as well as the low installation position. The 'hot inside V' also optimises the supply of fresh air to both exhaust gas turbochargers. Electronically controlled blow-off valves ensure a very immediate and direct response. The maximum charge pressure is 1.2 bar; the turbochargers have a maximum speed of 186,000 revolutions per minute. For combustion purposes, 2.3 times more oxygen atoms are pressed into the turbocharged engine as would be the case in a naturally aspirated engine. The two firewall catalytic converters in thin-walled ceramic material positioned down from the exhaust gas turbochargers respond very quickly due to their close-coupled configuration. In conjunction with two metal, underfloor catalytic converters, the M178 delivers effective emission control."
MachinePorn,2bvngq,mck1117,3,Mon Jul 28 01:37:17 2014 UTC,"Makes sense. Thanks for the info! Interesting read :)  EDIT: After a second reading and some critical thinking, I imagine this would provide all the benefits they claim, however also raise the temperature of the turbo significantly, thus raising the temperature of the cold side and lower overall performance gains. They had better include a really nice intercooler if they want to get serious performance increases down the road. I wonder what kind of EGT they get with this setup."

Have you seen the new Mercedes F1 engine that is currently dominating? It has another innovative approach where the Motor Generator Unit (MGU - used to spool the turbo avoiding lag) is located between the Vee of the engine. The compressor is at the front of the engine, and the exhaust turbine is at the rear, connected by the MGU in the middle.

Still, in a mid-engined sportscar a flat-6 is much more appealing IMO. Also, you could argue that the first Porsches were just using 4 cylinders because they were based on the VW beetle's engine and Porsche wasn't able to build their own engines from scratch in the beginning."

MachinePorn,2bn3jk,unhedged,2,Fri Jul 25 15:01:25 2014 UTC,Why is there no tread on the wheels?
MachinePorn,2bn3jk,Beerificus,6,Fri Jul 25 07:50:37 2014 UTC,"Tread is necessary to evacuate water from under the tyre, or to bite into slurry like gravel or snow. In the case of salt plains, the surface is usually a dry crust of salt over a hard, compact dried-mud lake bed. So in this case, treads are of no use.  Furthermore, some current land speed record machines use rigid alloy discs as wheels. The edge of the wheel cuts into the crust of salt and sits on the dried mud. This gives the vehicle good straight line stability, as the wheel is cutting and sitting in its own groove.  A heavy vehicle will benefit from this approach. The alternative is to make a wheel that lets the vehicle sit on top of the salt crust. This wheel will need to be wider (in order not to sink into the salt crust), and consequently cause more aerodynamic drag."
MachinePorn,2bn3jk,Jonboy87141,3,Fri Jul 25 09:35:22 2014 UTC,"Not a wheel expert, but I'm inclined to think that it's to keep a higher integrity (read: tougher) wheel surface.

However it does have a retractable bow thruster (azimuth aka 360°) aswell as two tunnel thrusters in its bow.   The hull itself isnt designed so much as to reinforce itself front monster sea conditions, but rather to allow the ship to more efficiently move through waves. Instead of conventional bow design where the ship rises over each wave, X-bows allow the vessel to pass through the wave, reducing the upwards motion and increasing the efficiency of the ship ( and reducing the effects of swell)   source; Marine engineer."

MachinePorn,2bn2eu,Ileach,8,Fri Jul 25 04:42:07 2014 UTC,It will be retractable thruster pods. Lots of supply ships and other vessels such as anchor handlers have these azimuth pods. These pods help it hold position and manoeuvre very accurately but they swing up into the hull when the vessel is on transit as they are no use over about 4-6 knots.

This vessel also has the retractable bow thruster. This is used to help the vessel maintain position when in DP mode ( dynamic positioning). This allows it to accurately stay alongside an oilrig. However, this protrudes from the hull, which increases the vessels draught and therefor to come into harbour it would be fully retracted. Also, they arent really designed ( the retractable type) to be used whilst under way. As they are not designed to be streamline.   TL;DR: Retractable thruster is there for increased maneuverability while holding one position or slowly moving using satalite and various reference systems. Without permanently increasing the vessels Draught."

MachinePorn,2bn7zu,Perryn,3,Fri Jul 25 09:24:58 2014 UTC,"It should.  It was designed simply to go fast, and those same design elements made it unstable at high speed and gave it a stall speed of 90mph.  It was prone to aileron flutter even after several revisions, and the small wings intended to reduce drag made it easy to over maneuver into a stall.  The idea of managing that line between keeping speed to stay up and turning delicately to not spin and crash reminds me of driving snowmobiles on water."

Standing about five feet high at the radiator cap, the frighteningly top-heavy car was referred to as The Beast of Turin.

MachinePorn,2bkq57,MangoCats,11,Thu Jul 24 11:21:30 2014 UTC,"Much less likely to tangle in lines.  Also, the bearings are huge (relative to a rotation on shaft bearing), making tolerances a bitch to maintain.

MachinePorn,2bkq57,fernguts,2,Thu Jul 24 16:19:22 2014 UTC,"The size of the bearings and the difficulty of maintaining it is probably why it's only good for low speeds, but I wonder how well it would compare to a conventional propeller without those factors?"
MachinePorn,2bkq57,Threedayslate,4,Thu Jul 24 16:25:43 2014 UTC,"The rim along the outside is the main reason that they're only good for slow speed.  The rim, or shroud, adds to the efficiency of the propeller in two ways.  Ideally, they are shaped like an airfoil in cross-section and can be use the higher speed flow inside the propeller disk area to create additional lift.  They also reduce induced drag at the tips of the propeller.  They will increase the efficiency of a propeller at any speed, however, at high speeds, the cost paid in frictional drag becomes too high for such a system to be workable."
MachinePorn,2bkq57,MangoCats,1 point,Fri Jul 25 00:26:24 2014 UTC,"If this is like the smaller (thruster version) I have seen, the outer rim does not move, the blades are rooted in the inner rim and don't meet in the middle.

MachinePorn,2bkq57,HAL-42b,11,Thu Jul 24 08:38:39 2014 UTC,The first page of this article gives some interesting points about why these are better than conventional props.
MachinePorn,2bkq57,FinnG,10,Thu Jul 24 08:46:48 2014 UTC,"The bearings of the RDT are designed to eliminate the need for lubrication oil and there are no dynamic seals. Hence, the bearings, which are both magnetic and hydrodynamic bearings (with patents pending), are designed to minimise maintenance costs and eliminate any oil pollution.   The bearing has been the main problem for anything rim driven so far. This needs long term testing in salt water to determine feasibility but hydrodynamic solution seems like the only one that could possibly work."

MachinePorn,2bhosb,sumnlikedat,12,Thu Jul 24 00:54:49 2014 UTC,"Copied from a user named Robo on Shorpy.com: ""a slurry of pulverized copper-bearing ore, water and surfactant chemicals is introduced into each of these centrifugal machines. A bubbly froth containing the valuable mineral component is whipped up and skimmed off for further purification. It's like a Copper Cuisinart.""  I believe this is a cascade of the units, so it gets more and more concentrated as it flows down from one to another."
MachinePorn,2bhosb,syncrotic,8,Wed Jul 23 13:10:11 2014 UTC,Definitely not a cascade - not all 150 of them anyway. The eight cells in each column are probably a cascade though. Source: I'm a mining engineer.

MachinePorn,2bhosb,syncrotic,2,Wed Jul 23 21:36:58 2014 UTC,Yep. Centrifugal force doesn't scale with radius.
MachinePorn,2bhosb,sumnlikedat,6,Wed Jul 23 15:54:27 2014 UTC,"These aren't centrifuges. The motors are impellers that stir the froth. Air is also injected through the rotor - the shaft is hollow. The tanks contain stators to keep from forming a whirlpool. The point of these things is to maximize mixing of air, water, and solids: the principle behind flotation is surface chemistry, so you want as much surface-to-surface interaction as possible.  Modern flotation cells are a lot bigger."

MachinePorn,2bgidd,FoodBeerBikesMusic,5,Wed Jul 23 10:26:40 2014 UTC,"One of the assessed practicals on my college (UK) Aero Eng course was to remove and replace a brake pressure sender from a Jetstream T1.  So we'd hop into the cockpit and cycle the brakes on and off until they didn't hold, then (following the AP) continue with the procedure. However, every single person that did this got covered in oil. The accumulators still had some pressure left in them when the brakes were inoperable, and there were some relief valves that could be operated from inside the nosewheel bay (where the pressure sender was), but the information about them was in a different section of the AP and wasn't even referred to by the bit we were using for the job.  I spent most of the year seeing people come out of there covered in oil. By the time I got to do it, I just cracked the seal on the line when undoing the nut and let it dribble (about half a litre or so) into a drip tray. Then my lecturer showed me the relief valve and the page in the AP when I said ""why the hell would a standard maintenance procedure waste so much oil and drown people, is there no valve?""  (all the other documentation was fine, it was just that one bit that was weird! If I was working on that thing more often I might've happened across the valve instruction beforehand and known about it.)"

I would have loved to see them mine the iron ore and coal, produce coke, smelt the iron, build the mold, cast the block, mill the cylinders, forge the crank shaft, etc. etc. and then, 3 hours later, bring the finished engine block to the plant where they mount it on the lawnmower. A man can dream..."

MachinePorn,2b9tai,troop357,6,Tue Jul 22 14:07:38 2014 UTC,"FYI the press shown in the video was build in 2008/2009 for Saarstahl in Völklingen, Saarland, Germany and it cost about 450 million Euro with everything surrounding it . It is located on land of the Völklinger Hütte whereas  parts thereof are a World Heritage Site. The press is one of the most advanced Freeform presses worldwide. I live not far away from there and someone working in a higher position at Saarstahl once told me ""What China considers good steel is considered trash at Saarstahl and will be recycled"". Saarstahl and the nearby located Dillinger Hütte are considered to produce some of the worlds best steel.  The ""Sendung mit der Maus"" never showed how a engine block was built but I think I found the video you're referring to.

If the brakes are too hot in a race there is a lot they can do: Change brake balance, adjust energy harvesting for the hybrid power system, stay out of other cars' hot air or lift and coast before braking (from high speed the aero drag gives 1G deceleration on its own).  Data is huge in F1. You'll often hear the pits instructing drivers to alter brake balance, fuel mixture, driving style and other things they can adjust to keep tyre temperatures, brake temperatures, fuel consumption and various other parameters at optimum levels. Plus there's the actual racing to do.  The electronics can break though, so maybe they have a sticker too."
MachinePorn,2b7p9z,mollymoo,2,Sun Jul 20 17:44:34 2014 UTC,"This is last year's red bull car, the engines were not full hybrids last year.   While it is true that they had the kers system that did harvest power from braking, it was severely limited in its capacity to provide both power and braking compared to this year's hybrid cars.   Additionally the kers system had to be deployed manually and it was not available to assist in braking if fully charged.   Not to mention that red bull was notorious for kers system failures."
MachinePorn,2b7p9z,thegreybush,2,Mon Jul 21 03:23:43 2014 UTC,Maybe the sticker is there so a mechanic can verify that the brake is save to touch before working on it.
MachinePorn,2b7p9z,phaeilo,7,Wed Jul 23 11:36:00 2014 UTC,"Hey, could you or anyone else explain what's going on when brakes fade?  I understand it is caused by heat and the effect is poor brake performance, but the how part I am ignorant of."
MachinePorn,2b7p9z,RexFox,2,Mon Jul 21 02:13:02 2014 UTC,"I dunno why you were downvoted. Here's a vote.   Emm, brake fade is just your fluid getting overheated and I think it starts to evaporate. You'll start feeling like your brake lines are not bled properly, that squashing feeling where the brake application loses it's responsiveness under hard braking. Just drain teh fluid and replace it and you're good to go.   Another thing that you might (hopefully) never encounter is brake glazing. This is when you have drums and you go out and rail your motorbike way too fast. You end up with your brake shoes actually get a glaze on them. You can fix it by just scrubbing that off with sandpaper. Then you have to wrestle the bastards back into the drum with that monster spring."
MachinePorn,2b7p9z,MacStylee,3,Mon Jul 21 03:07:55 2014 UTC,Thanks friend!  I figured I could learn something. I don't get it either.   I appreciate it!
MachinePorn,2b7p9z,RexFox,2,Mon Jul 21 03:24:36 2014 UTC,"Brake fade occurs when the brake fluid, itself starts to boil. This could be from simply being too hot, water in the brake fluid or both.  If the fluid boils, it is going to make pockets of gas (just like boiling water). So now, when you are pressing the brake pedal, you are just compressing that gas instead of transferring all that force through an (almost) incompressible fluid.  The result of this is a 'spongey' feel when you brake. It feels like the brake pads just won't 'bite'. In severe cases, you can (literally) push the pedal all the way to the floor and the car simply will not stop in any kind of hurry."

MachinePorn,2b7p9z,WillR,1 point,Mon Jul 21 15:31:41 2014 UTC,"They definitely have a sensor that relays brake temperatures from the car to the team.  For example, on the formation lap it's common to hear the team relay information about the clutch bite point, the tire temps, and brake temps to the drivers so they can trust the car will go and stop properly at the start of the race.  Keep in mind while the team can read the sensors, they cannot make any changes to the car remotely, the driver has to do that from the wheel."

MachinePorn,2b6qjt,ParticleSpinClass,10,Sun Jul 20 12:11:21 2014 UTC,"It does.  There's a gun barrel in the center of the prop which is why this plane was deigned that way.  Like the A-10 it was designed around a gun.  This time it's just a 37mm cannon, though."
MachinePorn,2b6qjt,monkeyfett8,3,Sun Jul 20 12:39:38 2014 UTC,"I am currently playing War Thunder, a game with airplanes, and this is in it. Description said they moved the landing gear to the front and also added a 37mm cannon, compared to other plane designs, which I think fires through the propeller hub.

MachinePorn,2b6qjt,Aquilo_,3,Sun Jul 20 12:20:32 2014 UTC,"I don't remember what plane it was, but a lot of them during WW2 had machine guns firing from right behind the propeller, so they had to include a neat mechanism to fire bullets only when the propeller blade was not in front of the barrel"

MachinePorn,2b6qjt,Aquilo_,3,Sun Jul 20 18:20:06 2014 UTC,Having the engine in the middle of the plane reduced the lever effect of having a massive motor cantilevered way out in front of the plane's center of gravity. The centrally mounted engine made it extremely maneuverable for its time.

MachinePorn,2b6qjt,jerrbearr,3,Sun Jul 20 14:58:15 2014 UTC,"The P-39 would have benefited greatly by retaining the turbocharger it had as a prototype. Altitude performance was abysmal with the single stage, single speed gear driven supercharger it shipped with. The twin engined P-38 had superb altitude performance with its turbochargers but it had its own issues.   Maybe its moot though, the P-39 was put to good use by the Soviets at low altitudes where supercharging didn't matter.   I really like the Allison V-1710, its just too bad Army brass had a fetish for turbocharging and didn't dedicate any funding to supercharger development. Even when they got around to putting a better supercharger on the Allison it was still inferior to the setup used by Rolls Royce for the Merlin."
MachinePorn,2b6qjt,Asmallfly,3,Sun Jul 20 16:22:25 2014 UTC,"The Merlin actually ended up with a supercharging system from Wright and a pressure carburetor (basically a mechanical throttle body fuel injection system) from Bendix, both were American. Why that same supercharging system wasn't adapted to the Allison is beyond me. In all honesty, I think the Allison just wasn't as capable of an engine.  The P-39 was originally designed with a turbocharer (another reason the engine was placed where it was) but the NACA didn't like the drag the cooling system created and nixed the idea. The P-63 Kingcobra (a development of the Airacobra) was being developed to use a turbocharging system, but the development was stopped because it was no longer needed. It can be seen on the very last page of this PDF."
MachinePorn,2b6qjt,TheBrokenWorld,2,Sun Jul 20 21:39:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks for this! The turbo-compound Allison was a beastly machine. One of my favorite machineporn subjects.  By that point jet technology was eclipsing the high performance piston engine in aviation, and it didn't make it out of the prototype stage as you said. Wright implemented a turbo-compound setup with some of their post war 3350 radials that served well, and continue to serve. An aerial firefighting outfit out of Greybull, Wyoming still flies turbo-compound 3350s in some of their firefighting planes.  Advanced high performance aviation piston engines and their systems are fascinating machines.   You probably already know this, but 2 great books any gear head should own are:  Vees for Victory: The Story of the Allison V-1710 Aircraft Engine 1929-1948  and  R-4360: Pratt & Whitney's Major Miracle  Both books are meticulously researched and will melt your brain if you read them for too long.

MachinePorn,2b6qjt,Asmallfly,2,Sun Jul 20 21:55:44 2014 UTC,And that also pretty much relegated the P-38 to the Pacific Theater because it could not operate at high altitudes.
MachinePorn,2b6qjt,nighthawke75,1 point,Sun Jul 20 17:51:22 2014 UTC,Russians had their far superior low altitude plane the Ilyushin IL2.

The advantages of P-39 were its tricycle landing gear and the slim nose which gave it great forward visibility.
MachinePorn,2b6qjt,HAL-42b,2,Sun Jul 20 19:38:55 2014 UTC,"You're very much mistaken; the two planes served entirely different roles, and the Soviets adored them both.  IL2s were purely ground attack planes, and Me-109s regularly tore them to pieces when they were caught without fighter cover.  P-39s were low-level fighters, hunting Stukas and 109s, they weren't used for ground attack, even though they surely strafed targets of opportunity."

MachinePorn,2b06u4,FoodBeerBikesMusic,2,Fri Jul 18 16:53:22 2014 UTC,"They still are.  I've been in several plants over the last 15 years, and they've gotten better, but are still pretty rough.  Electric arc furnaces are better than blast furnaces, and both are better than open hearth, but that's not saying much."
MachinePorn,2b06u4,FoodBeerBikesMusic,1 point,Fri Jul 18 17:03:17 2014 UTC,"When I first got hired, before I started, I told two friends - who don't know each other - separately. They had both been in the mill; one as a contract welder the other working for a company that did stack emissions testing.  They both said the exact same thing: ""That place is a shithole!"" - hence my use of the term.  I actually got used to the filth, once I developed coping strategies. I changed out of my street clothes, bought used work clothes from the uniform company-when they got too dirty, I tossed them- and I showered every night before I went home. Working in the machine shop wasn't as bad as the rest of the mill, either. (Plus I didn't really do all that much...)  The thing I remember from my two years there was being absolutely gobsmacked at the level of theft that went on! Everyone from the CEO to the janitor was raping the place."

MachinePorn,2b0hdr,Asmallfly,14,Fri Jul 18 02:35:15 2014 UTC,It is amazing to watch at speed.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRTYNxtbnjI
MachinePorn,2b0hdr,OGIVE,3,Fri Jul 18 13:26:04 2014 UTC,"Holy shit, those wheels go fast."
MachinePorn,2b0hdr,squeezy_bob,4,Fri Jul 18 13:35:53 2014 UTC,"I worked out the math on what the RPM is. The wheels of UP-844 have a circumference of 20.91 feet. Traveling at 60 mph the wheels spin at 252 RPM. Traveling at 70 MPH the wheel RPM is 294. The locomotive was built with to a design limit of 110 MPH, and then a safety factor on top of that so it is well within safe operating parameters. At 110 MPH the RPM is 463.  Another interesting thing to explore is the mean piston speed. This gives a general indication of how ""wound out"" an engine is. Until recently the Honda S2000 sports car had the highest mean piston speed of any production car: 25.2 m/s or 82.6 feet per second.  The formula for mean piston speed is 2 * Stroke * RPM / 60  UP 844 has a stroke of 32 inches. At 60 MPH the mean piston speed is 6.8 meters per second or 22.4 feet per second. At 70 MPH the mean piston speed is 26.18 feet per second. At 110 MPH the mean piston speed was 41 feet per second. That is roughly half that of the S2000 sports car.  Because high RPM puts a lot of stress on parts, steam locomotives designed for high speed service like UP-844 had large driving wheels. These tall wheels keep the RPM and piston speeds to manageable levels for the materials they were working with.  They are amazing machines."
