amateurradio,3e0pr7,Lifeguard2012,6,Tue Jul 21 07:02:16 2015 UTC,"RF is not ionizing radiation and isn't going to alter your kids DNA.   Actually there's been a recently published study (which I can't find at the moment, it was posted over in /r/science), which adds some sound science to it. It boils down to the following:   DNA is an electrical conductor the ohmic resistance of DNA correlates with strand breaks the repair mechanism detects defects by measuring the voltage across a piece of DNA; normally that voltage happens due to electrons being applied on one side of repair mechanism and the other side chemically counts the current coming through In an RF field the DNA acts like an antenna and the RF induced currents are detected by the repair mechanism, that mistakes the RF currents for its own measuring current → hence the repair mechanism can be made skipping over defective parts of DNA in the presence of RF.   However any measured effects in-vitro required quite strong fields. So strong, that already thermal effects began to kick in."

He was also always in the living room with his laptop resting firmy on his lap (right over the balls)  Additionally, he said phones produce too much RF as well, so he bought a bluetooth headset that he kept on his head constantly, since I guess constant bluetooth is better than occasional phone signal.

I want this to be readable by the layman and once you dive down that rabbit hole you realize, that it's actually not a trivial matter to convey what separates pseudoscience from actual science.  What makes matters worse is, that science itself has a cargo cult problem. Feynman already warned about it in 1974 in his lecture that coined the term cargo cult science; that people in science should be honest and communicate their failures just as any discoveries. In fact the failures are even more important.  But then I'm in science as well, and with each and every paper I've been on the authors list it's been the same ""struggle"" how to sugarcoat anything that's not a breakthrough or something new¹, because every kind of these flaws is cause for rejection. Recently we were playing paper ping-pong because all we presented was a new promising technology, which would allow new kinds of studies, but no actual study in that direction at all, but just replication of previous studies. And reviewers were constantly bouncing this, because it wasn't something totally new, we were just repeating old experiments with new equipment.  On insight I had collecting ideas for that essay was, that IMHO much of the current surge of pseudoscience (""scientifically tested products""), quackery (homeopathy, anti-vaccers) and baloney (esoterics, creationism) so many currently fall for also in parts stems from the fact, that those people who should do proper science actually fail to meet their own proclaimed standards.  And then you're thrown a curveball where the only (scientifically) honest answer will likely not satisfy the layman. Like when I recently tried to point out, that the sun is bombarding us with 1.4kW/m² of nonionizing (for the most part, down here under the atmosphere) electromagnetic radiation and got back, that this is ""natural radiation² and not artificial one"". How do you even tackle that problem, explaining that the process a photon was created by has no effect on the possible interactions that photon can undergo later on, that the only things that matter are its frequency/momentum, spin/polarization and orbital momentum.  IMHO it boils down to that the only way to educate people on that is to, well du'h, scientifically educate them. In today's world we must educate for scientific literacy (and mathematical and logical literacy, also some humanities, but focused on understanding not memorizing ""facts""). Unfortunately school systems all over the world are terrible in doing so; it's an ongoing problem for >40 years.

amateurradio,3e0pr7,r0wla,2,Tue Jul 21 13:27:37 2015 UTC,"I got to the note about autism before I gave up trying to read it.  The biggest reason more kids are being diagnosed with autism is because they're basically diagnosing it more. Kid has a behavior problem? Used to be he's ADHD, now they tend to label it as a form of autism.   That's where I pretty much walk away...trying to use autism as a reason to scare people is silly considering there's no proof of the connection. They don't want to hear more people are being diagnosed with it because the standards have changed...it's like they've had the same level of diagnosis for years.   If I had been born in the modern world; I would likely have aspergers or some form of autism attached to me...because I do exhibit some of the traits that could be connected with it. I grew up thinking I just needed to ""straighten up and deal with it"". But it seems a big problem is parents don't want to take responsibility for not correcting the kid's behavior...and when they get that autism label attached to them...god forbid you try to correct something they can't control.  The issue is....I've worked with autistic kids; I know the difference between a child who's genuinely autistic...and one that just acts up under that claim. When your child will begin to cuss you out, and laugh at it; that's not autism...that's a behavior problem you were told was autism...and there's zero reason to allow it to continue.  Average people don't listen to science, they want whatever allows them to be lazy and accept no responsibility.  There is zero problem with RF; period. If anything, VHF frequencies are absorbed by the body easier than 2.4ghz; and I don't recall anyone ever complaining about the 49mhz baby monitors...or the 900mhz monitors...but all of a sudden you break in to that 2.4ghz region and everyone loses it."
amateurradio,3e0pr7,coppertech,3,Tue Jul 21 16:03:36 2015 UTC,"There certainly are people out there who have made up their minds to be paranoid in spite of the facts. However, I think many more people are simply ill informed about these things and will change their minds once they understand the science. It's helpful to make comparisons to things people are familiar with. Visible light is a handy one that people see (literally) every day.  The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to it's wavelength. 2.4GHz RF is about 12cm. The sun puts out a variety of wavelengths, but the peak output is around 500nm. This means that average photon from the sun is carries around 240000 times as much energy as a photon from a wifi signal. This is about like comparing being hit by a house fly to being hit by a brick.  As most people know, the sun also outputs ultraviolet (UV) light. This is just high enough energy to actually damage DNA - lower energy photons don't carry enough energy to damage DNA. This threshold is around 300nm, or 400000 times as much energy as a wifi photon.  A 60W incandescent light bulb is about 10% efficient, giving off about 6W or 12 times as much energy as a 1/2W wifi transmitter.  A 1/2W wifi transmitter at a distance of 3m gives an energy density of about 4.4mW/m2. The energy density of sunlight at sea level is around 1050 W/m2. That's a ratio of about 2100 times as much energy per area from the sun as from a wifi signal.  Human body absorption is a complex topic, but I think it is fair to say that the human body is much more likely to absorb most sun photons (visible light or higher energy) than RF photons (lower energy). I say this because radio frequencies can pass right through people, people are not visibly transparent. This means that of the photons that encouter a person, many of the RF ones will tend to pass right through without interacting at all.  In summary:   The only difference between visible light and RF is the energy of the photons (determined by the wavelength/color) and the number of photons (determined by the power and the wavelength/color). The radiation from visible light (from either the sun or artificial sources) caries 240000 times as much energy as wifi The radiation from the sun that is high enough energy to start causing damage caries 400000 times as much energy as wifi The total amount of energy given off by a light bulb is about 12 times that of a wifi transmitter The total amount of energy in a given area from sunlight is about 2100 times that of wifi (at a distance of 3m)   Conclusion: If you are afraid of wifi, you should be extremely afraid of sunlight or any other visible light sources. The only sensible solution in this case is to lock yourself in a pitch black room deep underground.  If I'm off on any of these estimates, please feel free to correct me."

amateurradio,3e00h8,i_love_beats,18,Mon Jul 20 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, so to start off with, my qualifications:  8 years as a radio and radar systems engineer dealing with currently employed communications and radar equipment.  Secondly, a disclaimer. I will not discuss anything classified, or that I am unsure as to it's classification. Let's talk general theory, not hardware or specific systems.  So, what you're asking is kind of a nebulous question, because you're using terminology like ""superior technology"", and it just isn't that cut and dry. Communications systems are incredibly variable not just based on how new they are, but because a given system can be employed in almost infinite different configurations. Jamming technology is a little more easily defined. It comes in two broad forms, passive, and active, and can then be broken down further from there.  Passive jammers generally have no clue who or what they're jamming. They make noise, on lots of frequencies, either all at once or jumping around. Their job is to make communication difficult in a broad sense. They're as likely to piss off SATCOM as they are to jam ground to ground or air to ground communications, cellular networks, or wifi systems operating in a similar frequency range. Encrypted, in the clear, they don't care. Their sole job is to decrease the SNR across a given chunk of the spectrum.   Passive jamming systems are pretty easy to work around though, as we hams can demonstrate with PSK or CW. While SSB degrades quickly in the presence of an AM broadcast station on 40m, for example, PSK31 or CW can very likely continue on the same frequency long after SSB has been rendered useless. This is due to characteristics of the mode that give it noise immunity, which makes it difficult to just overwhelm it with broad spectrum noise. The wider the frequency range your system can utilize, the tougher it is to jam passively, as your jamming system has finite output power. The more frequencies you want to cover simultaneously, the less power you can put on each individual frequency.  Different characteristics that can provide noise immunity include multi-carrier or multi-frequency simultaneous or sequential transmission, forward error correction, time or frequency domain spread spectrum, extremely rigid standards for when and how data is transmitted (allowing noise to be easily detected and discarded) and super narrow, low bitrate modes that have substantial efficiency advantages over broader transmission modes. Interestingly, nearly all of these are used to some extent and in some form on the ham bands. JT-65 in particular is very good at what it does because it uses several of these, namely the spread spectrum (in a very narrow window), its very predictable structure, and its very narrow instantaneous bandwidth. Pactor II/III offers FEC, and true spread spectrum is possible on the ham bands from UHF and up, in most countries at least.  Active jammers tend to have a very particular system, or set of systems in mind. They are constructed in such a manner that they either independently attempt to replicate a particular communication system's protocols, for instance, jumping frequencies at a rate and in an order that a particular spread spectrum system is known to use, or it listens across the spectrum it can operate on, and then plays copy cat, waiting for a signal to appear on a frequency, and then flooding that particular frequency with noise, or even with what might look like valid data.  Active jamming varies in sophistication from some dude listening on a receiver and then tuning an AM radio transmitter manually to follow the transmitter, to exceedingly sophisticated systems that can attempt to, for instance, inject fake targets in to a radar system by mimicking a valid echo, or doing something similar with spread spectrum communications systems to generate invalid data that degrades the decoded signal.  Active jamming can be harder to defeat in the short term, because if they know how your system works, you may be quite limited in what you can change as far as timing systems and frequency ranges on the fly. In the long term though, a relatively subtle shift in the function of the communications system can create quite a lot of work for the jammer to catch up to.  It is very much a cat and mouse game, and how effective a given communications system is in the presence of jamming, and how effective a particular jamming system is against various communications systems varies wildly depending on how they are employed, and to what end they are employed.   A sophisticated, agile, OTP encrypted, time and frequency domain spread spectrum communications system using highly variable timing across a broad range of frequencies, with good noise immunity, that is used infrequently for only high priority traffic, can be nigh on impossible to effectively jam with any consistency, even if you know quite a lot about how the communication system works. Each time one of these qualities is modified for ease of use, convenience, or hardware degradation though, that resilience is reduced. An example would be using the above described system constantly for days on end, letting the enemy get a good long look at it.  Similarly, a highly sophisticated active jamming system that is narrowly targeted at just a few, or perhaps only one system, with good knowledge of the system to be jammed, and that is subtle in it's operation (relying on data  injection rather than brute strength, for instance) can be rather difficult to detect and/or evade, particularly in the short term (on a time scale of a single day or infrequent events scattered across several days, for instance), and even more difficult to nail down as far as capability, so countering it can prove to be a lengthy trial and error exercise.   EDIT: Rephrasing and grammar, mostly. No factual changes."

amateurradio,3e00h8,123x2tothe6,7,Tue Jul 21 06:57:12 2015 UTC,"Have a look at ""spread spectrum"" radio systems https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum If you scatter your energy over much more bandwidth than it normally needs, using a ""secret"" spreading method, the receiver can ""de-spread"" the signal and get it back. The jamming signal must occupy a huge amount of bandwidth to degrade your signal to noise ratio. The jamming signal must be huge to cover up a spread spectrum signal. Look at the concept of ""spreading gain"" CDMA cell phones use direct sequence spread spectrum signals. Did that help? 73"
amateurradio,3e00h8,RFtroll,5,Mon Jul 20 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"Also, the jamming signal itself becomes a huge target.

amateurradio,3e00h8,cyan_and_magenta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"If the jammer has little or no knowledge of the enemy's spreading details, they must ""noise up"" all the bandwidth where they could be. When the spread spectrum receiver unspreads the signal it correlates it into very narrow effective bandwidth, but the jammer isn't coherent with the traffic signal, so only the very small part of the jamming signal, that is the same as the traffic signal, gets through. The vast majority of the jammer's energy is jamming where the signal is not, and is wasted, so to work, it needs to run a shit ton (technical term) of power. Also, remember radio signal strength declines by 1/distance2 if you aren't close to the receiver, it takes a mega shit ton of power to be louder than the SS signal where it matters. It would be easier to show this on my bench with a couple signal generators and a vector signal analyzer..... was that any help?"
amateurradio,3e00h8,RFtroll,3,Tue Jul 21 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, right. Thanks!"
amateurradio,3e00h8,cyan_and_magenta,4,Tue Jul 21 21:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm familiar (to a certain extent) with SS and the requirements necessary to sustain a strong jamming operation. What I'm not getting is how jam proof radios which use ECCM to ""intelligently"" counter-jam, would be able to sustain their ability to successfully prevent signal jamming if the enemy is using these sophisticated jamming technologies in the first place, which are designed to defeat ECCM counter-jammers.  Also, the requirements, while high, have the potential to become feasible once you're dealing with multiple jamming devices.  TLDR: What happens once the jammers and the counter-jammers go to war with each other? Is spectrum dominance still feasible at that point by either warring faction?  btw, All of this info is available (and easily accessible) in the public domain.

amateurradio,3e00h8,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:49 2015 UTC,Another thing to bare in mind is that with modern technologies jamming is merely a reduction in data rate.  A highly robust protocol like JT65 will likely still be able to get through.

The act of making info outing classified information doesn't automatically declassify the information. It's still classified information, it's just classified information that is now no longer under the control of people entrusted to use it in a responsible way.  Additionally, sometimes unclassified information can fall in to the classified realm if certain connections are made. For example;   XYZ island is know as a military testing ground.

Use your fundamental knowledge of advanced math and signal theory to calibrate your BULLSHIT detector. If it were obvious Marconi would have used spread spectrum. It's like any other military technology thing, the smart guys will figure it out for real, most will operate on partial knowledge, and not really get it, we exploit them. It takes a while to get up to ""grad school"" level signals and systems theory, but it's not impossible to understand. A well conceived spread spectrum com signal is a problem to jam, and a problem to detect. Tactics are hard to guess if you don't have plenty of knowledge of your enemy. An example that comes to mind is that it's a bad idea to jam an enemy signal that you're using as a homing beacon for an air strike. Radio direction finding is just as fascinating as secure radio systems... go look at  ROHDE & SCHWARZ and L-3, they want to sell this stuff, their web sites are fun to study.... no exact details, but a hint at capabilities.

amateurradio,3dzgz8,jagged2600,3,Mon Jul 20 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"It provides better decoding of packets than soundmodem. I haven't performed any serious test side-by-side yet, but in my experience soundmodem is usually deaf. Extmodem provides three independent decoders running in parallel, and while it uses more CPU, it can better decode packets. On the Raspberry Pi 2 with a 900 Mhz CPU is using 50% of it, just a single core of the four it has.  The lacking feature of extmodem yet is, in Linux, to provide a KISS kernel interface like soundmodem.   edit: if you can trust different sources, the author of the algorithm published some tests in his QEX paper and got around ~960 decoded packets, and this other test with soundmodem got 412 packets, both using the same test source."
amateurradio,3dzgz8,jagged2600,3,Tue Jul 21 01:07:14 2015 UTC,I've found volume settings and soundcard properties to have the most effect on soundmodem.  You cant filter out overdriving the input of your soundcard...

amateurradio,3dx4mw,killingRadio,29,Mon Jul 20 06:59:12 2015 UTC,"I'm running into the same thing here.  My only option is buy a home in a rural area.  People have become so inured to the seemingly mandatory and ubiquitous presence of the HOA, complete with outrageous fees ($250+/mo. on a $350K property isn't uncommon here and I know that probably seems reasonable to some people), that they don't complain.  I'm not sure how this happened in the first place, because certainly people got along just fine without HOAs and CC&Rs prior to the mid-90s when this trend really got rolling.  I blame realtors.  They seem really good at pushing things on customers that nobody in their right mind would want or accept, relying on the opaqueness and intimidation factor of the home buying process.  HOAs seem like a solution in search of a problem and classic rent-seeking behavior.  On a more macro level, these extra-governmental authorities are really mucking up peoples lives.  There have been stories of absurd degrees of corruption within them, cases where homes have been taken from homeowners and sold to cronies for pennies on the dollar because of late HOA fees in the hundreds-to-low-thousands of dollars.  Under the best of circumstances, they seem to be filled with busybodies who awaited the beginning of every school year as an opportunity to be a hall monitor, under the worst of circumstances, they're cabals.  Regardless, they operate with no oversight on the margins of the law.  However, I suspect that although congress is going to pay lip service to passing legislation to provide relief for amateur operators, little is going to happen.  The passage rate for bills, any bills, is under 10%, and few of our elected purchased representatives are going to be willing to actually sign off on a bill that interferes with the contractual rights of businesses actively involved in making money, even if their business is essentially a protection scheme.  I'd say that we're going to have to learn to love our attics as I have, start assembling clandestine antennas outdoors, and be prepared to ask forgiveness rather than permission.

But they can put a lien on it which would prevent you from selling it, or would require that they get paid out of the proceeds of the sale before you do.  You're not wrong though.  Almost no one really owns their homes.  Almost every home in America is held on a fee simple title, not an allodial title, meaning that just like in royal England, the land is owned by ""the state"" (or in the UK, by ""the Crown"") and if you, as the vassal, fail to pay your property tax to your feudal lord (the gov't), he will take ""your"" property.

If there's a park in the development, it makes sense to have an HOA to maintain it.  Likewise, if you're a multiple-attached-units condo, it makes sense for things like replacing the common roof.  In a single-family residence community with no significant commonly held property, no private roads to maintain, or anything, HOAs are nothing but an infringement on private property rights."
amateurradio,3dx4mw,K7LAG,12,Mon Jul 20 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"Funny story.  I was a property manager for about 5 years.  In 2008 when the construction industry stopped, I went back into IT.  I learned a lot about the industry and reading by-laws, decs and such.  Around that time we moved from our townhouse.  It sat empty for almost 2 years because nothing was selling.  We started to run out of money and I either defaulted or rented it.  The problem was the units were to be solely owner occupied.  I went to the association and made my case and I was promptly told to ""Fuck off"".     The association was hemorrhaging money and didn't have a pot to piss in.  From the amount of foreclosures not paying dues and shit we had to fix from the developer who did the conversion, there wasn't any money.  So they started to foreclose on units to rent out.  Which is a great, if the units weren't specifically to be owner occupied.  The town we lived in required landlords to be licensed.  It was a $30 annual fee and then you were allowed to rent.  The town also demanded that the ""owner occupied"" be added to the titles of the properties when they were converted from apartments.  When they denied me the ability to rent my unit I called the city.  Their response was ""They paid the fee, they can rent.""  At this point I went fucking nuclear. I could have simply ignored the rules and rented the unit, but I didn't want to deal with that hassle when it was found out that I had a renter.    So I called the village attorney and asked him ""Why are you willingly and knowingly breaking the law?""  PRO TIP:  Never ask an attorney this, their heads literally explode.  After he calmed down, I explained the situation, the restrictive covenants that HE HIMSELF made the developer add to the deeds, but you're allowing the association to rent, essentially making the city and association ""above the law"".  I thanked him for his time and said I'm going to contact a lawyer to check what my recourse is in this situation.  I let it sit for 30 days just to see what happened.  I believe the association had 5 units that they were renting out.  I'd drive through every week or two just to check on my unit and that 4th week all the rented units had sheriff notices of evictions on them.    Turns out the association told the city to fuck off as well, they were going to rent the units. The city had to take the association to court and evict the renters to enforce the deed.  I feel bad for the renters, but it felt so good to win and make that fucking board lose money.  You can fuck with associations, but it's hard and you have to be smart."
amateurradio,3dx4mw,ShittyFieldTech,24,Mon Jul 20 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"My tactic to fuck with associations was to join the board and be a hardass about making the rules reasonable.  We completely revised the Rules & Regs document, and I made sure that there was a sunset clause in it.  The rules & regs have to be reapproved by the membership every 3 years or all the rules go away.  And it took 4 tries to get quorum just to elect the board, so it'll never happen for the reauthorization of rules that no one really wants.  In July 2016 that neighborhood will become a free-for-all despite the existence of the HOA.  :)  It was my parting gift to the neighborhood right before I moved out."

The current mass trend towards HOA's has absolutely nothing to do with realtors or with people wanting to live in cookie-cutter houses.  When a parcel of land is re-zoned for residential use, a very large fee is required for the installation and more importantly the maintenance of utilities like roads, water, sewer, etc.  One way to avoid this fee is to set up an HOA which will be responsible for all of these costs.  The city/county management loves this because they will still be able to collect property tax for all eternity on all of these parcels, but will never need to spend a dime in maintenance.  They can then use this extra money to repair the failing infrastructure in older neighborhoods.  Developers love it because their up-front costs are dramatically reduced, and since their investment costs are reduced they can pass this reduction on on the cost of the houses.  (I guess you could say that realtors like this because the houses are easier to sell because of the lower prices, but that is only an indirect consequence of the situation.)  Typically the HOA is managed by the developer and not turned over to the community until a certain number of lots have been sold.  Once of the reasons they do this is so they can keep the HOA fees artificially low to prevent that from turning away customers.  Now, if you are the initial purchaser of the house and are not planning to live in the neighborhood for a long period of time this can be a great deal.   They key is getting out before the HOA fees rise and it becomes difficult to sell as a result.  Because oh yes, as soon as the community HOA realizes just how expensive long-term maintenance on the utilities really is the HOA fees will start rising.  TL;DR:  If you live in a HOA and are fretting over your antenna, you are worring about the wrong thing!"
amateurradio,3dx4mw,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:53 2015 UTC,This isn't universal.  My HOA has no responsibilty for any utility installation or maintenance.
amateurradio,3dx4mw,caller-number-four,3,Mon Jul 20 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, of course not.  The original HOA concept was designed for completely different purposes, and it has only been in the past 10-15 years that the raison d'etre of HOAs has evolved from one of protecting property values to one of cutting costs for developers."
amateurradio,3dx4mw,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Mon Jul 20 21:51:08 2015 UTC,"Now, if you are the initial purchaser of the house and are not planning to live in the neighborhood for a long period of time this can be a great deal. They key is getting out before the HOA fees rise and it becomes difficult to sell as a result. Because oh yes, as soon as the community HOA realizes just how expensive long-term maintenance on the utilities really is the HOA fees will start rising.   Not every state is like this, but in my state, our HOA had to have a reserve study performed every few years, to ensure that we are adequately funding the reserves for the repair and replacement of the common areas (incl the private roads in the community) at the end of their projected lifespan.  About half of people's assessments ended up in this reserve fund so that when the road needs to be replaced down the line, the money is there.  But not all places have to consider total long term cost of ownership, and so, just like the US government, they spend everything they have today, and will just raise taxes/fees when the road breaks."
amateurradio,3dx4mw,K7LAG,5,Tue Jul 21 00:04:20 2015 UTC,"Same problem.  Can't find what I want that isn't in some HOA controlled development and land is crazy expensive.    The neighborhood I currently live in is still under the developer/builders for the 'hood, i.e. they control the board.  The developer put it in the HOA contract that they have a ""class A"" vote and home owners have a ""class B"" vote.  Class B is always 1 vote per household.  Class A varies.  The first phase was four votes per lot the developer owned.  I think it stayed that for the second phase as well.  then it went to 8 votes per lot in the third phase, and 16 votes per lot in the fourth phase.  not hard to see they don't want home owners to have control until the last few lots are left, and there are quite a few left, plus they could just open another phase.  So getting control of the HOA and making a change is impossible at this point.    That being said, i did get approval to put a 25ft tower in for a tv antenna, since the only spot i could put it was the front of the house or the fence line due to the huge house next door blocking the TV signals.  I ended up just putting the antenna on a 10"" metal pole and it worked.  I have an S9v18 that is pretty stealthy."

amateurradio,3dx4mw,Hoshnasi,4,Mon Jul 20 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"In 2009, my (then) GF and I found out that the ""junior townhouse"" (another fabrication of the realty industry...it was a two floor condo that had an apartment below it) we were renting was in foreclosure.  I did some research and found out that it was purchased for $590K in 2005, but it's tax valuation in 2009 was $179K.  We decided to try to buy it.  As part of this, I found out that the HOA fees in the development (Summerfield at Brambleton in Ashburn, VA) ranged from $200-300 per month.  They would have literally been more than 10% of our mortgage payment.  Even at the $590K original selling price, if you got a good interest rate, they would have been a disproportionate amount of your monthly nut.  The only thing that offset this was that it included basic FiOS Internet and TV, which would probably set you back about ~$70.  (I'm sure the bulk price they got from VZ was less.)  But, in exchange for that, all of the other providers were shut out of the development (not that any sane person would want Comcast cable instead of FiOS, but still...)"

amateurradio,3dx4mw,ljheidel,5,Mon Jul 20 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, many people like to point out the sacrosanctity of the 2nd Amendment without considering that that our forefathers couldn't have possibly conceived the size of the country today, or the advancements in firearms.   Up until some time after WW1 it was perfectly legal for both civilians & private companies in the US to own whatever armaments they wanted. I am not just talking guns here but artillery and explosive devices.  So it is hard to say what the founding fathers would say about people buying military-grade armaments today. It was certainly normal & common place in their era.  Now obviously their era did not have biological or nuclear weapons, so there's that.  Interestingly the ARRL was founded by a guy named Hiram Percy Maxim. You know how he got his education in science and wealth to tinker with radio, right? His father & uncle were US civilians who spent their time experimenting with guns and explosives at home, eventually parlaying that into vibrant careers in military contracting. Try doing that today and the ATF would come visit you in a hurry but it was completely legal & common for the first 150 years or so of US history.  Strangely the 2nd amendment is only thought of in relation to guns when during the 18th century ""arms"" was a more generic term including blades, artillery, and explosives. One of the side effects of this change in word-usage is that it is easier to carry a gun for self defense in much of the US than a pocket knife, since the laws on guns are so well understood & relatively consistent. But a knife's legality is subject to all kinds of variances on a local city level, county level, and state level, and this is enforced by police who generally don't know what these laws actually say. It is probably not coincidental that the big Baltimore race riot of this year started with a dispute over whether the deceased's pocket knife was legal or not (turns out, it was)."

With that said, I always looked at 2a from more or less the point of view as the people being the deadly weapon.  We citizens of the United States can bear arms to protect ourselves from violent people.  Both my neighbor or my elected officials.   The gun just becomes a variable.  Since both sides will be incentived to obtain the most effective weapons regardless of the laws."

I agree with where the blame goes, and there's more.  I know realtors that will tell people that ""HOAs protect your home value"".  I'm fairly certain there is no proof of this and no study that's been conducted.  They just all (well most) believe it like sheep.  If it was written, they could be sued to the moon and back, so they just say it.  The worst part is that I think the OPPOSITE is true - I think HOAs are destroying home values because there has been a critical mass of stories like those you mention.    And to make matters even worse, a lot of associations have community-owned property that the local government does not want to take over (because each one has at least a park, so we're talking about a lot of additional maintenance)."

I explained to my realtor that no property with an HOA or any form of CC&Rs that would restrict antennas was acceptable.  I was expecting him to look at me like I was some sort of kook, but he actually took it in stride.  He said that it wasn't all that uncommon these days for buyers to insist on an HOA-free property.  Seems that people who buy homes these days tend to have spent many years renting before they could afford to buy, and they don't want CC&Rs that are indistinguishable from the last lease they signed.

Yeah, sure, and it would have been on the market for about 7 hours, like all the rest. I was fortunately able to find a reasonable hoa that was old enough to be run by people who were chill, and it had no antenna restrictions so they were inclined to accept just about anything.

I don't want to be told why that isn't what I want to buy.  As it happens, I didn't have to go this route with my realtor, for which I am grateful.

She explained to the Realtor real estate agent that she wasn't interested in becoming a landlord at that time, and just wanted to own something outright.  She was often out of the country, etc. and didn't want the hassle.  Once the Realtor real estate agent saw that she wouldn't be able to talk her into the fat payday from not just $1m but $3m in sales, she dumped her.

amateurradio,3dx4mw,threeio,2,Mon Jul 20 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"As the son of Realtors, I can tell you that not all of them love HOAs. When I was a kid, my dad fought the terrible, unreasonable sidewalk superintendents and won big.   Mom has since passed, but Dad goes out of his way to warn buyers away from homes under the control of HOAs. Admittedly, this is becoming more and more difficult, but he still makes the case to each buyer.   When they ask why they might be so bad, he regales them the tales of his fight against the HOA nearly 20 years ago.   When buyers are properly informed about how pervasively awful HOAs can be (our HOA didn't provide discount utilities or anything like that-- it just empowered a bunch of jerks to force you to keep your shutters, shingles and mailboxes all within 8 Pantone shades of each other), all generally without much genuine benefit, buyers walk- as they should. Unless they have a pool, but even then- you can buy a nice pool for $400 a month (our previous do-nothing, no benefit HOA dues) and not have to share it with jackasses.  HOAs don't protect anything other than the visual conformity of the neighborhood and do little beyond perpetuating their own existence, empowering hard-asses to make their reasonable neighbors hate them. Screw HOAs.  Much of the supposed protections that HOAs were envisioned to provide are already handled by local zoning and blight ordinances. That's why I enjoy living where I do, far from the city lights.   Heck, my county does not even have a zoning authority.   If I want a tower, I erect a tower. I don't ask for permission from people who really don't figure into it. Permits? What are those?  If I want to start digging for minerals on my land? Where's the excavator?  I want to harvest timber without restriction? Where's the saw?   On the off chance that I decide to raise livestock (I don't), I could without any sort of government or regulatory intervention.      /rant TL;DR: I hate HOAs. My realtor father does, too. They're largely useless and exist only to enforce ridiculous uniformity (one of us! ONE OF US!!!) Forget that noise. Move 25-30 miles into the country. Fast internet, no regs."

The topic of HOAs and their jerkish tomfoolery causes my blood pressure to spike and my face to redden. Much like snakes, I've never met an HOA that I liked. Sure, they probably exist, but not in my state. That was precisely why I chose to move a bit further out.   Do I regret the additional costs of travel and whatnot to afford such a ""Whatever, I do what I want"" style attitude (while keeping things classy)? Absolutely.   For me, the decision came after living in four neighborhoods with HOAs. This was before I was a ham and even remotely concerned with antenna restrictions. I just grew so tired of people telling me that my lawn was 1cm too long (that actually happened once!) or that my wife's marigolds or impatiens weren't in-line with the ""established beautification standards and regulations"" that I reached my limit.   Don't get me wrong, I'm all for people taking pride in their property/things and, by extension, people caring that their property looks decent, but placing a lien on my property because white impatiens were the standard and we opted for pink is just clown shoes. But I digress... again...  Sorry- the average HOA lunacy takes me from a mild-mannered Bruce Banner and makes me want to tear shirts.   Unrelated, I grew up not tremendously far from where you live now, albeit on the other side of the river, where each week was another adventure dealing with the HOA with their tape measures and loops of paint swatches.

Fines for non-compliance with community standards increased sharply to $50/day with no cap. I couldn't sell my house fast enough.

In wealthier developments dues is a plus because it acts as a filter to keep out those belonging to lower classes. People will pay extra knowing that no one else can move in next door unless they're fairly wealthy. Bonus pts if the money from the dues is put towards private security and/or upkeep on a fenced off, gated perimeter.  But anything middle class or lower it will limit the pool of potential buyers so much that it will probably be counter productive to some degree."

I was a newspaper editor at the time the realtors announced they had trademarked the word and it should be used as a cap R followed by the encircled R symbol. I refused to use the word as described because I don't believe any affinity group should be able to trademark a common word and it never appeared as anything but ""realtor"" in any newspaper that I edited.

Case and point: when I wanted to put antennas on the roof of my house, I politely asked them to put them up. Of course and predictably they answered with a ""nope"". My next, still very friendly letter in response to the denial was that I asked them to review: a) the federal guidelines in regards to commercial tv and radio antennas (and I provided the URL for them) and b) I asked them to review my application.   What do ya know, a few days later I had a letter in my hands stating that I now can put antennas on my roof.   I believe sometimes people want to be deceived and by declaring the antennas ""for the reception of commercial tv and radio"" they have a hard time denying  Edit: And who said you cannot use a 2m antenna for the reception of commercial radio?

amateurradio,3dx4mw,MyrddinWyllt,7,Mon Jul 20 21:42:51 2015 UTC,"It is worth fighting restrictive HOAs - most are run by amateurs, and go far beyond their legal authority. Remember that it wasn't until the mid-70's that the last of the ""no black people allowed"" language was scrubbed from HOA agreements around the country.  Colorado law has a good example that you may be able to draw support from: http://www.cohoalaw.com/from-capitol-hilllegislation-new-legislation-supports-homeowner-use-of-alternative-energy-devices.html  In 2008 we passed a law preventing HOAs from restricting the installation of ANY energy efficiency or renewable energy system on a home in Colorado. This means clotheslines, solar panels, swamp coolers, lighter color roofs when installed to reduce cooling loads, etc.  The law still allows them to require a review period prior to installation, and allows them to make rules and request changes to the installation as long as it doesn't a) reduce the effectiveness of the system, or b) significantly increase the cost. So they could ask ""can you center the PV system on the roof so it looks nicer lined up with the door"" but they can't say, ""move it to the north side of the roof so no one can see it"".  It was a big win in CO, and proof that HOAs aren't as powerful as they think they are."

The best I've heard about them is ""well, they aren't too annoying and it's difficult to find a place to live without one around here."" Most people agree they suck, from radio operators to gardeners and more.  I think it's also dependent on where you live. Places with lots of newer construction tend to be HOA controlled, where older neighborhoods aren't."
amateurradio,3dx4mw,MyrddinWyllt,14,Mon Jul 20 15:25:02 2015 UTC,"I have yet to find anyone that actually likes an HOA.   I have come across quite a few people who do. The one thing they all have in common is that they are control freaks who are only truly happy when it involves telling other people what to do & how to live their life.  They're the same people who expect a sense of hyper sterility everywhere they go and will complain to corporations demanding they fire any min wage employee they come across with a visible tattoo no matter how tiny or tame it is. A small military tat on someone's arm no exception.  The same kind of people who ask their local school districts to role out uniforms, even if they don't have any kids.  Even cemeteries aren't exempt from this nonsense. The independents & nonprofits are being bought out by big national conglomerates, who in turn immediately role out content & appearance/size restrictions on the headstones and refuse to cooperate with genealogists, historical researchers, friends of the deceased, or sometimes even family members when they come looking for a specific grave and ask the office for help finding it.  Usually the response is something like ""we can't due to privacy concerns,"" which is of course expressed orally and not written because it is a legal fiction.  My personal theory is that our society is switching from seeing individuality as an asset to seeing it as a liability, and that is why so many things that are benign but different/unusual are being put under a microscope (such as ham radio operators' homes, car enthusiasts who want a project car in their garage to wrench on, reptile breeders, artists, etc). I stopped believing in the ""its just people concerned about their property values"" lines when I realized how many neighborhoods no longer allow you to have a project car in your garage, where no one will see it while the door is shut to know its even there. If its not visible its not effecting property values, this is simply a matter of controlling people."

Arresting parents who let their kids go outside alone (become so common that now they've coined the ""free range parenting movement"" to describe rare decenters). Rolling out new dresscodes or uniforms where they previously did not exist. A thriving niche market of products designed to spy on kids (GPS trackers, keyloggers, spy cams etc). Standardized testing (where students only succeed by selecting the best answer, not by selecting the correct one). The widespread belief that people have a right not to be offended, no matter whether that offense was rational or not. Dumbed-down devices like smartphones that discourage tinkering, moving consumers to an environment where everything is controlled by the brand (see: Apple's iWatch, iPhone, iPad etc). A widespread vegetative state of narcissism brought on by the mass media as it advocates for consumer fundamentalism (see: the made-up word ""selfie"" and how it was brought into the mainstream). The throw away society in general.    Someone born in the year 2002 would be 13 years old today. They are used to the security theatre and they are used to the list I give above.

I've also heard them limiting the types of fertilizers you can put down, preventing you from composting, the whole antenna restriction, etc etc etc.  Part of the problem that you probably ran into is that people expect the stricter rules in an HOA to make the neighborhood ""look nicer,"" which is the argument for better home resale values.

This weekend we found a home built in the late 70's with plenty of RV's parked in the yards. I'm thinking this is great, no CC&R's. Wrong, the CC&R's exist, but RV's are allowed as long as they are behind a fence. Unfortunately antenna's are allowed only if they can't be seen from the street, so no tower and a vertical may be too tall. The language of the covenant from 1977 reads, ""No exterior radio, short wave or television antenna or other reception or transmission facility shall be permitted that is visible from any site across the street or from the streets."" This covenant is written in a way that using a cordless phone or cell phone use is not allowed from the driveway. Just insane.  As far as real estate agents being aware of CC&R's that is a lot to ask of profession with such a low barrier to entry. In this instance the CC&R's were filed in another county, I have seen some that are filed in another state. CC&Rs can be a very difficult to research.

amateurradio,3dx4mw,ai6aj,2,Mon Jul 20 19:21:59 2015 UTC,"I get to be the ignorant guy here.  Since §97.15(b) states that you can't preclude amateur radio reception, wouldn't this fall under the same guidelines as OTARD?  I mean, yeah, it's murky, and I would imagine some HOA could pull out a pack of lawyers and rake somebody over the coals for it, but has the guideline been legally tested yet?  That is, are we asking for HR 1301 to pass because it might be interpreted wrong, or is there some kind of ""stare decisis"" (<- fancy legal phrase of the day) that exists that necessitates HR 1301?"
amateurradio,3dx4mw,IamNabil,3,Mon Jul 20 19:31:06 2015 UTC,OTARD only applies to television broadcast reception. It never has covered the amateur radio service. The FCC has asked for congressional guidance when applying PRB-1 to private use contracts. HR1301 provides that guidance.

He cannot change the colour of his roof, the style of fence, colour of the front and garage doors...he can't even change the type of plants in the garden!   Recently they were involved in a class action lawsuit over the type of shakes on the roof that were mandated by the developer and the City that later rotted and leaked only after a few years.  The payout covered less than 1/4 the replacement cost (and shakes aren't cheap!).  He does nothing but bemoan the HOA.  They seem to spout about the benefits of the setup in preserving the house values, but then houses in his development seem to take months to years to sell under asking price where others in surrounding non-controlled areas sell in days to weeks over asking price...seems like way too much trouble for what it's worth.

The other 99% of the population doesn't give two shits whether or not they have an HOA or whether a potential HOA has antenna restrictions.  Amateur radio operators have to yell loud to be heard over the din of chatter from the 99% that don't care.  We, as a group have zero influence on housing prices, that's why we have to take the conversation to congress.  There are many places where buying outside of an HOA isn't an option.  People still have to go to work, and kids still have to go to school.  HOA's are moving into areas they weren't in previously, and residents are being outvoted by their neighbors.

I don't ever want to own property that I am mandated to pay dues, this isn't a dickish PnZ enforcement but a voluntary agreement, that was agreed upon purchase.  No HOA takes up so much land you can't buy elsewhere.  They are very localized and distributed.  If I am a dick for pointing out the facts and considerations you or others should have thought about before plopping their life savings or taking out a huge loan it isn't my problem.  If you want to buy into such an idiotic agreement then bitch about it I can't be so sympathetic.  Sell your house and buy one that does not have idiotic restrictions."

amateurradio,3e0c09,molo1134,2,Tue Jul 21 02:17:50 2015 UTC,"I believe the real question here is whether the presence of the ferromagnetic material will have any significant effect on the value of the inductors in the radio.  I think a static magnetic field will have no effect, thus there will be no difference between whether there is an unmagnetized chunk of metal next to your radio and a magnetized one.  I'm not 100% sure about this and it is something I have occasionally wondered about, so a comment on this from someone who really knows RF engineering would be appreciated."
amateurradio,3e0c09,FullFrontalNoodly,4,Tue Jul 21 01:17:44 2015 UTC,"Not an RF engineer, but have done some power electronics. Static fields will have an effect on ""magnetics,"" which are inductors, transformers and the like.  Infact, devices exist that exploit this effect. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_amplifier  As far as magnetic density in ferromagnetic materials go, a magnetic field is a magnetic field, no matter what caused it.  To answer the question, yes, if it's a ferromagnetic cored transformer or inductor, placing a magnet near it will lower the inductance. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_%28magnetic%29 for an explaination. This is not a good thing, and could let the magic smoke out. This is the same reason why big CME events are a danger to the electric grid--they lower the inductance of mains transformers, and then they'll go over-current because they're out of design spec. Also lets the magic smoke and oil out of the transformer.  Additionally, there are other electromechanical devices inside your radio that could be affected. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_switch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder#Magnetic_absolute_encoders Come to mind.  TLDR; use adhesive."
amateurradio,3e0c09,andthebatman,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:34 2015 UTC,If you are able to stick magnets on your radio then it is essentially a magnetic shield as it stands. ;) Sure it's steel not soft iron or Mu-metal but it will still shield.   http://my.execpc.com/~rhoadley/magshield.htm
amateurradio,3e0c09,va3db,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:38 2015 UTC,"Aah, I had not thought about saturation.  I tend to think you would need a rather substantial magnet (or get it close to the inductor core) to saturate it.  So to clarify my comment, so long as the total magnetic field (generated by the coil and the external magnet) does not drive the core into saturation I do not believe there will be any effect."

amateurradio,3e0c09,FullFrontalNoodly,0,Mon Jul 20 23:55:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've wondered about this. The thing about CRT's is that they make lots of X-rays. If you got a big, beefy magnet and started moving and concentrating the electron beam, maybe you could get some leakage, potentially by creating a hole. There is a fair amount of power in one of those things, relatively speaking. It's like a magnifing lens in the sun."
amateurradio,3e0c09,andthebatman,3,Tue Jul 21 02:15:24 2015 UTC,"The reason why you don't want to place a magnet near a CRT has nothing at all to do with safety, it has to do with permanently damaging your TV.  Color TVs have a metal screen in their face, and this screen will become magnetized if you place a magnet near it.  I discovered this the hard way as a child -- the trippy color patters made by the magnet deflecting the electron beam don't fully go away when the magnet is removed!  Sure, you can call out a TV repair man (at least, when they still existed) to de-magnetize your TV (at fair expense) but you'll never be able to completely remove all of the effects.  On the other hand, if you happen so spy someone getting rid of a working color CRT TV, you can have some fun doing this before sending the TV off to the recyclers."

amateurradio,3e0c09,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"isn't this why there's a degauss button?   If you have a degauss button, yep, exactly.   Is there a point where degauss will not work?   One way to demagnetize things is to apply an AC magnetic field to the object and gradually reduce the field strength, until you are left with just a tiny residual field.  The built-in degauss has a coil around the CRT.  These were usually fairly simple circuits -- when you hit the button, the coil would be attached to the AC input, in series with a thermistor.  As the current flowed, the thermistor would quickly heat up, and the current would decay.  If you've ever played with that feature, you probably remember that hitting it again wasn't anywhere near as strong.  That's because the thermistor hadn't completely cooled yet.  With something like a fridge magnet or a speaker nearby, the built-in degauss could handle that fine.  But if you got a neodymium magnet really close, the residual field would be very high, meaning you need a large field to counteract it to successfully demagnetize it.  Running the built-in degauss cycle many times would probably eventually get it reduced down, but it'd take a lot of cold starts.  The big handheld degaussing coils would be much more effective for a really strong residual field because they have a larger field to begin with and the process can be repeated several times back to back.  TL;DR: Yes, degauss button will not fix a CRT after being near an MRI."

amateurradio,3dykxq,radio_dx,5,Mon Jul 20 16:16:02 2015 UTC,Easiest way? Get a QRP CW kit and build a wire dipole from some scrap wire around your house. Everything you need to make QSOs would fit in a zip-lock bag.
amateurradio,3dykxq,redoctoberz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:46 2015 UTC,"Unless you mean ""easy on the wallet"" or ""easy on the shoulder,"" I don't think I'd agree with this, particularly for someone just starting on HF. Inexpensive and portable, sure, but QRP, CW, and kit building are, on their own, more challenging than many newcomers to HF are prepared to tackle. Putting the three together at the same time is very likely to be a recipe for frustration.    I'd think a better starting point is a mid-range, portable all-mode HF rig (I like the KX-3 and the FT-857D myself) and starting out with SSB. This isn't as cheap as the QRP/CW/kit approach, but in my view it's much more appropriate for the OP's criteria of ""best"" and ""easiest."" This will present the easiest transition from someone who is already licensed and likely already familiar with phone operation. It also provides avenues for growth in multiple dimensions, including other bands and modes, with a much gentler learning curve than a new rig.  I prefer QRP/CW myself, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone just starting out in HF."
amateurradio,3dykxq,radioidol,3,Mon Jul 20 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"I mean easiest to build, easiest to operate, simplest design, cheapest on the wallet, easiest to carry, easiest to setup,etc. It will probably never break, it takes only a couple AA batteries to operate, and is just plain simple to operate on."
amateurradio,3dykxq,redoctoberz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:37:39 2015 UTC,"While I don't disagree with some of those, I don't think most of those are germaine to the OP.   My FT-857D was easier to build than any kit ever. I put all the pieces together and was on the air in about 5 minutes after unboxing. I don't think any QRP kit is easy for a non-CW-literate user to operate, much less easier than one of the rigs I suggested.   It seems that we are reading different OPs. If a newly minted General asked you this question after passing his exam, you'd recommend a QRP-only CW-only kit as his first HF rig? That might well be his last HF rig!"
amateurradio,3dykxq,radioidol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:53 2015 UTC,"QRP-only CW-only kit as his first HF rig? That might well be his last HF rig!   All depends on budget.

If the budget permitted, he could get a All mode 160-70cm rig as well as the QRP CW rig, as the CW rig is pennies in comparison."
amateurradio,3dykxq,redoctoberz,3,Mon Jul 20 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"All depends on budget. He asked for easy, something like that is the easiest you can go on your wallet.   That isn't what most people mean when they say ""easy."" They usually mean something along the lines of ""operationally simple"" or ""with a minimum of fuss or pain."" Neither of these describe QRP CW kits for the newcomer.    I'd have no issues recommending a QRP CW rig to a new general, or even a tech (for 15/40/80m).    I think you do them a disservice if you offer up QRP CW as the opening suggestion when you don't know that their budget is limited to pocket change and have no reason to expect that they're interested in taking on several additional (and IMHO unnecessary) challenges at once.  A new HF operator already has to learn how to use a rig, learn the proper etiquette, learn the band plan, etc. I don't think a ""sink or swim"" approach is the best way to encourage newcomers to get enough experience in HF to learn what they're really interested in.     Creating things from scratch and playing around with fun electronics projects is the core of this hobby.    That might have been the history of the hobby, and might even have been why you got into it, but most people are not getting into amateur radio these days primarily because they want to build a radio. Most are getting into it because they want to use a radio. There's enough challenge to be had for a newcomer in setting up and improving upon antenna systems without also heaping on QRP, CW, and DIY radios from the beginning.    If the budget permitted, he could get a All mode 160-70cm rig as well as the QRP CW rig, as the CW rig is pennies in comparison.   Then the relatively inexpensive all-mode DC-to-daylight or HF+6m rig (i.e., not something like a FTDX-9000) should be the opening suggestion. If that's too expensive, or not enough of a challenge, or too heavy for ultralight backpacking, or whatever, then a discussion of QRP CW kits--with the appropriate caveats--may be appropriate."

amateurradio,3dykxq,MyrddinWyllt,2,Mon Jul 20 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, that's about 1200 in 'MURICAN money. You're probably not going to want to go for a single band radio at that budget, and QRP is probably not the best option. My vote would be for a Kenwood TS-480SAT, the 100W version. Multiband, multimode, made for mobile operation. It doesn't have as much menu tomfoolery as the FT-857 does. Should be well within your budget.  Avoid QRP for now. It's frustrating for new ops and with the solar cycle fading it's getting harder and harder.  Change the power connectors out for anderson power poles, run a fused connection direct from your battery to your radio with power poles as well. This will let you bring the radio in and out of the car as needed."
amateurradio,3dykxq,MyrddinWyllt,3,Mon Jul 20 17:32:49 2015 UTC,A FT450D is also a good rig for that price range.
amateurradio,3dykxq,Aegean,2,Mon Jul 20 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 857 and 480 are a little better for mobile but the FT450D is one of the most recommended radios for beginners on this sub and is likely a better radio overall."

It does look like the ts480 has a similar menu style system, so that comment may have been worthless anyway.

amateurradio,3dwl5w,VA7EEX,8,Tue Jul 21 01:43:22 2015 UTC,"FT-101EE's were frequently run on 11m in the 1970s both in and out of band.  Using one on 11m is obviously illegal.  D&A was one of many manufacturers of sweep tube-based amplifiers that catered to the CB crowd around the same era.  Most accepted a few watts in for a few tens to a few hundred (usually very dirty) watts out depending on the tube complement.  At some point, they tried to skirt the law by adding a small crystal oscillator to them and marketing them as ""CW transmitters"" (this is still done by CB amp maker Texas Star as well).  If it has a crystal socket somewhere on it, that's why.  Those usually are on the front, though.  They could have been ran together.  Some of those amps had a driver stage that could be turned off and driven with a higher wattage rig.  Hams have reworked them to work on HF in the past, but they're better off as a conversation piece or a source of parts.  The 101EE is a pretty decent rig if it hasn't been golden screwdrivered too badly, which is a good chance if it was used on 11m."
amateurradio,3dwl5w,VA7EEX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:08:19 2015 UTC,"This one has a couple sockets on the back so... But I did figure out how to get it powered up and was met with 8 glowing tubes. I'd be lying if I said I'm not going to try it. Maybe on 10m locally after sundown just to see how dirty it is. If nothing else clean it up and throw it on ebay. I gave less for the whole lot than I've seen the amp or radio sell for.   That mono band amp is a D@A Raider, not another Maverick. Tubes all glowing in it as well.  The band selector on the 101EE was on 11m when I got it. You're not making me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Guess I won't know for sure until I key it up. Still want to get someone that knows a lot more than me to give a good going over."
amateurradio,3dwl5w,rriggsco,2,Mon Jul 20 05:33:58 2015 UTC,"If the tubes are still good and you're able to clean it up, you could likely get some decent cash for it.  Maybe recap it before you put it up for sale if it seems like the original electrolytics have gone south.  In the case of some of those amps, the tubes are worth more than the actual amp itself since they're no longer made.  I'd imagine there are some of the less scrupulous CB folks running those old boxes but at the same time, it seems like some people are starting to collect them instead for show.  I collect old CB base station tube amps myself to add to the extra pile of crap that I'll never use on the air, but for obvious reasons tend to keep that part of my interest in radio stuff quiet.  There's some good information out there on the FT-101 series and this is one place to start: http://www.qsl.net/nw2m/ft101.html.  I think there's also a Yahoo group for them as well.  There were, IIRC, some other ham rigs (and even ham-lookalike rigs like the Siltronix 1011 series) that were popular around the same time that likely had the same fate as a lot of FT-101EEs but I think some people who repair them keep that in mind when taking on a project.  I wouldn't be surprised if some FT-101 gurus can tell you exactly where to look for signs of 11m op abuse and tinkering, along with how to fix any issues that come with it."

A guy I work with brings me a box one day with an item in it saying he has no idea what it is, but though I might know, and wondered if it was worth anything to sell. I knew it was a keyer but not much else. The box just randomly got delivered to him. I told him no one but a ham would have any use for it so a pawn shop wouldn't likely give him anything for it. I convinced him to let me track down the owner and get it back to him. Turns out its a prototype iambic paddle by a guy that passed away a few years ago. Someone was cleaning out his stuff and just mailed the key back to the address that was on the box. Just so happened to be my co-workers house.

For the head unit placement, I have a 2007 Hyundai Sonata Limited Ed and I was able to fit the detached head in the storage compartment under the HVAC controls.  Not sure what the layout is on your car, but the install was easy using a block of wood wedged inside the compartment.  The only holes I had to drill were inside the compartment (all hidden).  For running the power, the easiest route I found was to bring it through the firewall on one of the rubber blanks that are just need to be punched through the grommet.  Then I ran down to the trim work under the door, straight back and then used the folding rear seat to make it into the trunk.  Unless you fold down the seats you can't see any wires.    Used a trunk lid NMO mount and can't be happier.  Antenna tip is a few inches below the shortest parking ramps I have been in.  Only take off the whip when I go through the car wash.

Another option: http://newsuperantenna.com/ $230 or so for a full portable vertical setup, not a bad deal."

If so there are a number of options out there BuddyPole, CrankIR, Packtenna, wire in trees, etc.   Right now I'm using a HamStick (MFJ Hamtenna) Dipole mounted to a 32' painters pole that is erected in a PVC tube partially driven into the ground. The downside is that it's only one band at a time, has limited wind usability and requires a choke. On the upside it was only about $100 total to setup, it keeps the GF happy, is less than 20' long and breaks down small enough to store in the corner of my office when I'm not using the radio.   As for more permanent installs if you have some tall trees and a tuner you can do a random wire antenna, or if you find a place with an attic w/o metal you can have any antenna you want to stuff in the attic including folded dipoles. I've even heard of people connecting to their metal gutters through a tuner (though it would seem like an ill advised plan to me)"

For the coax feed, go for the direct connection. What I'd do is this: Buy two jumpers. One with an SMA male to SMA female, six feet or so, and then a three foot SMA female to whatever. This one doesn't matter because you'll cut the end off and attach it to the beam's driven element. You can then permanently affix this short piece to the boom of the antenna. Don't buy RG-174 or really thin jumpers; RG58 or RG8x or LMR240.  Then the six foot piece screws into the end of that short piece, and the far end into the radio.  That way you can take the big ugly coax off and roll it up, but you aren't messing around with having to solder a coax jack straight to the driven elements."

I've been able to do DX with wire dipoles hanging out my window to nearly the other side of the planet, SSB and Digital modes. I work contests, hit up HF net, rag chew etc, Basically everything you could possibly do besides Sat and EME. But this only happened because a) I knew I was going to want to do everything and wouldn't have the money to buy a lot of different radios and b) did some investigation and spent some good money.  Part of me thinks the HT route is a good one for most because it is super cheap. $35 HT plus a cheap home made ground plane antenna in your attic works great (thats how I hit up all my local VHF/UHF nets).

amateurradio,3dw9wf,Phreakiture,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:47:45 2015 UTC,"A 2m HT is your basic minimum kit.  With just what comes in the box, you can get on the air.  A dual-band HT is a better choice, however, if your budget forces you to pick between dual-band and reasonable power, pick the power.    2m is much more heavily used than 440.  I have heard near-zero 440 traffic in my area recently, and most of what I have heard has been from cross-band repeaters.  A number of Chinese brands have come onto the markets recently . . . Baofeng, Wuoxin, Jetstream, etc.  Some hams gripe mightily about these radios, but the truth is that they work pretty well and sometimes have a few extra tricks up their sleeves.  I own a Jetstream mobile radio, and I like it quite a bit.  Bandwidth function is not usually relevant.  Most FM operaiton on ham radio is wide (i.e. 5kHz deviation).  If you are operating simplex in an area with high congestion, moving to narrow (i.e. 2.5kHz deviation) might make some sense, but this is generally not going to be an issue.  It is more relevant if you want to use your radio to (ahem) monitor what is going on outside of our bands.  Narrow-band FM is becoming increasingly popular on VHF, and, for instance MURS radios are required to operate narrow-band on channels 1-3."

I am a bit bummed because this one image would have been perfect if it weren't for whatever happend with the transmission (assuming that's what it was). I'm further bummed because the one time I forget to record the audio of the pass I need it. You can change settings and run resync/slant correction options if you have the audio but not if you don't. If you have the audio you should try that. I was using MMSSTV too. I did have the audio from a video I was recording but it has background noise which gets picked up and makes image noise, but you can see what I was able to achieve with the resync option in MMSSTV:  http://i.imgur.com/IDSxMHj.jpg  With that said I still got two basically perfect images on the earlier passes.

amateurradio,3dv96z,Frogging101,2,Sun Jul 19 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"""Tuning up fine on all bands"" doesn't mean a whole lot if you haven't actually checked the SWR on the antenna itself from your rig.  A tuner will make anything look like an SWR of 1:1, but it doesn't do anything about the inefficiency of a high-SWR antenna.  If this were my setup, the first steps I would take is to buy/borrow a decent SWR meter and actually measure it.  High SWR will inhibit both transmit and receive capabilities.  I find using something like WSJTX and pskreporter invaluable for checking how well I'm doing (I run QRP most of the time).  Also, as another commenter mentioned 20m has been iffy.  It comes and goes...sometimes the band will appear to be ""dead"" then 5 minutes later it will light up."
amateurradio,3dv96z,kz5q,3,Sun Jul 19 23:17:54 2015 UTC,It's not just you.  I'm running an Elecraft K3 with a KW into a 2-element SteppIR at 30'.  It's sucked for the last few weeks.
amateurradio,3dv96z,verygeeky,4,Sun Jul 19 20:27:50 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at the numbers. Typically, Kp has been good, solar wind's been slow, geomagnetic field has been quiet, 10.3 cm flux has been above 100. So, what gives? Why are the bands no good?   It's like there's a full tank of gas, even the windshield washer fluid's topped off, but the car won't go."
amateurradio,3dv96z,andthebatman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:34:36 2015 UTC,Bands have been bad. Also depending on the way you have wrapped the wire it may make the antenna very directional.  Is there any other places you could put an antenna? An end-fed out in the yard over a tree or something?  Hit me up if you need a hand with anything.
amateurradio,3dv96z,Quantis_Ottawa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:45:56 2015 UTC,"Bands are kind of Meh. So it's kind of hard to gauge right now.  Tuning the antenna is more like fooling the radio into thinking it has a near perfect 1:1 match. Are you running a internal tuner? If so, what may be happening is that you are losing power as soon as it enters the coax. If you need to stay with this kind of set up, you might want to consider a external tuner that is located at the feed point of the antenna. This would allow you to transmit more of your power. I also believe that it would help in reception as well. Heck would you could also try is a loop in your attic, fed by normal coax, and then  terminated into an external tuner. Just use some sort of method to hang it with insulators or heck, even string."
amateurradio,3dv96z,cqmaps,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:35 2015 UTC,In which direction is your antenna oriented?

amateurradio,3dw0xy,heavymetalcat1,2,Mon Jul 20 00:21:23 2015 UTC,"Previous answers are correct. It's a case of Two Wrongs Actually Do Make a Right. It's a matching harness for using two quarter-wave CB antennas on one radio. Feeding them with the proper feedline -- like RG-58 variety through a TEE connector on the back of the radio would result in a 2-to-1 mismatch and an unhappy radio...maybe not unhappy enough to cause a catastrophic failure, but if the radio did fail the antenna manufacturer would be blamed, for certain. So, companies like Hustler and others developed a harness using precise lengths of the wrong impedance cable to fool the radio into seeing a proper load. At the same time,mounting these antennas about a quarter-wave apart (conveniently, about the distance from one 18-wheeler West Coast mirror to the other) results in a figure-8 radiation pattern -- up and down the highway...and it looks pretty, too. Balanced.  73"
amateurradio,3dw0xy,KenTenTen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:31:58 2015 UTC,"The whole figure 8 pattern only comes about when the antennas are spaced by a quarter wave (~9 feet at 27.285MHz iirc) out of curiosity I modeled the pattern in matlab with different spacing. At 6 feet it's an elongated oval and at 4.5 feet you may as well not try.   Knowing this, I always get a chuckle when I see two CB whips on a pickup like an S10. It looks pretty but that's about it."

(if you're on a 440 HT and crossbanding through a mobile, and the mobile is repeating the 2m signal back to you on 440, you have to ID through the 440 side! Any transmitter has to ID.)  So what he did is take an mp3 player, loop an audio track that was 9:55 of silence and then an ID, feed that into a Baofeng set to VOX, low power and transmitting on the 2m RX frequency. Every 10 minutes, it'd TX and the crossband would ID out the 440 side."

DXEngineering has them for pretty cheap.  For field day thats all we used to wire the entire house for future events.  I opted for the expensive cutter/crimper/stripper kit, and I have to say its worth the money vs using a pair of side-cutters and a pocket knife.  I also have solder-on Amphenol PL259's but I rarely use them.  Takes some practice, a good wide-tipped high-wattage high-mass iron to get good flow.  The DXE cutter I've had mixed results with.  It gets the outer coating great but cutting the dielectric its pretty hit and miss (cutting vs mangling.  If you square off the center conductor it works better).  /u/Kilocycles showed us how to strip and crimp at FD without using the fancy cutting tool (and a whole lot faster) but it takes some practice with the channel-lock parrot-beak looking coax cutter (if you cut coax, they are well worth the investment)."

amateurradio,3dqzp2,Kilocycles,6,Sat Jul 18 23:57:57 2015 UTC,"Amateur radio is the only facet of radio that I know of, that still is stuck in the mud about using solder and clamp connectors. Every other industry that is involved in RF has made the switch to crimp or captivated pin style. Yes, there are some connectors that you solder but those are ""specialized"" to a certain extent and require a skill set that is generally above hobbyist amateur operators. It would be a great skill to have, so don't let the fact that some connectors are hard to solder dissuade you. :)  Any time a new ham asks ""what PL-259's should I get?"" the answer should unequivocally be ""high-quality crimp""."
amateurradio,3dqzp2,Kilocycles,3,Sat Jul 18 17:17:51 2015 UTC,"My question would be ""why PL-259"" ;) but yes, you'll need at least one for the rig side."

amateurradio,3dqzp2,Galen_dp,4,Mon Jul 20 14:32:21 2015 UTC,"I have not used anything other than PL259 style connectors. I understand why someone would use the N connector.  What about RCA, F, TNC, and BNC. What are the benefits and drawbacks to these?"
amateurradio,3dqzp2,adx,3,Sat Jul 18 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"RCA were originally audio connectors. Unless you get very good quality connectors don't even think of using them for RF. They have been used by builder (Solder smoke etc.) for interconnect instead of BNC or what the pro's would use, SMA. They will pull out if you just look at them funny. Nonetheless RCA were used on older radios. BNC are nice but careful to use only 50 ohm type for 50 ohm cable. The pins are a different size and cause problems if interchanged.  Type F. inexpensive. Cheap. TV. Cheap. Older HT's (Wilson 1402) used them. horrible."

amateurradio,3dqzp2,PriusPilot7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:41:23 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly shocked that it seems everyone is recommending crimp over solder. I'm the opposite and don't want a single crimped connector anywhere near my gear! Why, because I've had so many crimped connectors fail and have yet to have a single solder PL-259 fail. When I first got into HAM radio I ordered some RG-213/U assemblies for my initial home VHF/UHF base. The connector on the antenna, which was not under any stress, failed some 6 months later. I also ordered quite a lot of the SuperFlex LMR400 clone jumpers about 24"" long and have had 3 of those fail as well. The failures are always the same where the outer jacket of the coax starts slipping out of the connector. Also don't get me started about the SMA crimp connectors on tiny coax..... even worse.  Simply put no matter how high quality your crimp connector and tool are it's still crimping onto a very slick outer jacket on the coax. I'll stick with a bit of extra work and keep the solder smoke rolling and know that my connections will hold up."
amateurradio,3dqzp2,ke4ke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:50:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is, crimping is better from a mechanical and electrical viewpoint, but only if you own the proper crimper and only if you know how to use it properly. For one or two connections either borrow someone who knows how to use a crimper properly (hence owns the crimper) or solder. If you are going to solder at least use quality connectors. Personally I'll go through an adapter to type N then use type N before I solder another horrible PL-259."

I think it has a one minute resolution, so if you use a different grid more than once a minute, you'll end up having to log the wrong time.

amateurradio,3dp9sl,DuffLab,11,Sat Jul 18 03:31:24 2015 UTC,"What you are describing are actually already in orbit as AO-27, AO-50, SO-50, etc. Fox-1A and Fox-1C are going to be flying repeaters when they launch later this year/next.  I am professionally an electrical engineer that works on launch vehicle and spacecraft avionics. I design circuits/PCBs that go into space.  Let me dissect your comments to give you an idea of the world we live in regarding satellite design.   Would it be possible to mount a 2m or 70cm antenna ""inside"" a CubeSat, maybe one that could be deployed using a spring mechanism after launch?   Yeah, but that's a lot of complication for a satellite if you don't need it. Most amateur satellites are volunteer built and therefore time/resource limited. Keep it simple because if you don't/can't test it you are taking a lot of risk on. Keeping antennas folded and deploy by just cutting/melting a hold-down mechanism is the way to go..   How much power would be required to transmit back to Earth, would it be 250mW, or up to 1-2W? Yup, 250mW works but a watt or two makes it easy.  What kind of repeater hardware could be used, could it be some Motorola or Icom equipment, or would it have to be custom built?   Custom. You can (and people do) fly off the shelf radios. But this is assuming a LOT of risk that is unecessary and if you're spending $100k+ on a launch you best know how to make it reliable (assume another $100k for the satellite design/build). Icom and Motorola radios are not designed for the harsh environment of space and pose a real risk of failing during launch due to vibrations or in orbit for radiation/thermal cycling.  Space is Harsh  When I'm designing for a flight rated circuit I have to design for the following realities.  Launch  The harshest part of a satellites life is often the first 10 seconds and closely followed by the first 10 minutes. When a rocket engine turns on near the ground the vibrations rattle the rocket and all electroncis severely. Sound waves (strong enough to literally shred your internal organs apart) bounce off the ground and hit the rocket also coupling in causing more vibrations. This is strongest in the first 10 seconds or so. After that it get smoother but these vibrations can break harnesses, shear components off PCB's, crack copper traces, etc. Later on, stage seperation and payload deployment often impart shock events onto the satellite with forces easily reaching 1000g's momentarily. I've seen components, soldered down properly, rip right off PCBs.  Orbit  In Low Earth Orbit the sun rises and sets 16 times per day. The electronics must usually be rated to withstand MIL1540 specs (space is really hot and really cold in light/dark) so the inside of the satellite, while protected, can swing from -34C to +61C or at least must operate there fine. It does this 16 times per day and that stresses parts with thermal expansion and contraction causing fatigue and eventual failure. Radiation is another issue, programs can have bits of memory randomly flip, a radiation hit to a MOSFET can cause it to avalanche into failure and short the power system too.  Heat  All head conducted from the sun into the electronics as well as heat generated by the electronics MUST be extracted by conduction and radiation. You do not have convection in space so air cooled heatsinks and fans are useless. Extreme effort is taken to make sure parts are getting head pulled away through the PCB's or heatsinks to a part that can then radiate the heat into the cold black of space (very cold).  So yes custom. Space is hard and no one can fix parts in orbit. We often keep our parts designed into circuits such that they are ""derated"" and therefore extend the mean time between failure (MTBF) such that the bottom of the ""bathtub curve"" is elongated. This means all early mortalities (workmanship defects) are removed but normal wear and tear is minimized and the rate of failures after infant mortalitity and before the end of life time is as low as possible."

This antenna design provides a very wide frequency range, determined only by the range of sizes of the dipole arms, with a good match to the LNA. The antenna is constructed using bent wire, which has been shown to give excellent performance in our testing to date. The manufacturing technique leads to a minimal use of material and is inherently low cost. Prototypes are easily manufactured on CNC wirebenders, with a clear route to SKA volume manufacturing. Although the choice of materials will be finalised in the design phase, stainless steel has survived very well in the Australian site conditions and represents a low risk, but at slightly higher cost than mild steel. A groundplane may not be required as it supports only the lowest frequency of operation, where the system in any case operates in a very high sky noise regime. At all the other frequencies the log-periodic provides its own “groundplane” via the lower frequency dipole arms. However, an integrated groundplane can be considered to give system predictability in different environmental conditions."

In this picture, these are deployed in a geographical location in which all man-made radio signals are ""banned"", so as to create a ""quiet"" zone, because the signals are pretty weak.

You'd use a grinder to scrape off corrosion and fire protection and attach it and the wire. Use #4AWG stranded wire up to the roof to the mount.  Since you're penetrating a steel roof you would be best to install a roof jack with a PVC pipe that can be sealed up. You don't want to use steel conduit as it makes the install more complex. Put one directly next to the antenna mount so the mount can be bonded down directly and immediately to the structural steel, and one where you want the line to enter so you can put in the coax.  Once inside, route the coax over by the beam and install a lightning arrestor there and bond it to the structure with #6awg stranded. Now you are done and can do as you wish."

Any instabilities in the crystal/oscillator get correspondingly divided down.  Or, if you want to avoid the digital section, there are 200 KHz crystals you can build an oscillator / driver around, though you'll have to look harder for them.   Either way, you're basically building a small crystal-type transmitter with an output not intended to ever see an antenna.

Since you're generating a signal in a computer you can do what elecraft and I think the other manufacturers do, which is generate a signal using DSP at 15kHz, or a little more and that moves the opposite sideband and carrier further from the intended signal, this makes the job of the IF filter easier."

The unit is probably wired for 220 plus has a high voltage section that would literally go off with a bang if there is an issue. Best bet is to be up front and tell the buyer its history and where you found it, unless the local club takes care of it for you, they probably have more expertise. Those are some true gems."

amateurradio,3djnij,MyrddinWyllt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:34:01 2015 UTC,How do I check if the tube is intact. Sorry for the noob question.
amateurradio,3djnij,mwilliams,2,Thu Jul 16 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"on the Swan, you can see them inside through the grates on the top. They look like lightbulbs, sorta. You may need to open the linear. Look for empty sockets, though those look like they are in really good condition considering. It's hard to tell any further without powering them on or having a tube tester, and powering on can be risky in tube stuff.  If you crack it open to look inside, be careful. It's pretty unlikely, but there's still a chance of high voltage remaining even after it's been unplugged for a while."
amateurradio,3djnij,jkstark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:24:43 2015 UTC,"You would have to open it up and see if they are present and look unbroken.  To really test it, you need a tube tester with sockets that match the kind of tubes you have."

That's a really stellar radio, the Cadillac of radios in its day.  It was also my first radio that I got from a member of a local club.   For what it's worth, mine had issues and I still got around $400 for it.  If that amplifier is working as well, you've got a killer combo."
amateurradio,3djnij,sticky-shorts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:35:38 2015 UTC,"when you say it has a built in power supply, does that mean it doesn't need to be connected to an outlet or anything else? If so, I just hit the power button and nothing happened."
amateurradio,3djnij,VA7EEX,3,Thu Jul 16 20:47:36 2015 UTC,"Ah, apologies.  Typically, ham radios need an external 13.7V DC power supply.  But the TS-940S has one built in (which contributes to the weight!).  Here's an image of the rear of the radio - does yours have a power cable coming out of it like that one?  I think it's a pretty standard power cable, similar to the one that modern PC power supplies use.  So you'll need a power cable like that plugged into the radio and the other end into an outlet.  And hopefully, you'll see it come to life like this one.  If you get it powered up, the next step can be getting an antenna for listening.  Do you have any interest in amateur radio, or are you just looking to understand what's on your hands?"

amateurradio,3djnij,Tymanthius,2,Thu Jul 16 23:55:17 2015 UTC,"Please accept my belated condolence for the passing of your father who you say became a Silent Key about 10 yrs ago. You never asked what became of his ham shack and your Mom never said? That's so strange, but not for me to speculate upon and so I'll stick to offering you my advice that you asked for. First, you need to understand that all these years later what you have there is still nice equipment, and is still worth considerable money even if not all in perfect working order (which I have a feeling it all is). Bear in mind that when people offer to ""take it off your hands"", they are doing themselves a big favor, not you. I know you've heard some tempting pricing in response to your query, but before you dispose of it at any price, you might take pause to give the value of what you have received for free into emotional as well as financial consideration. Your dad's prized equipment has been waiting patiently for the right someone to come along and return it to life for a decade. I say it would be in your best overall interest to delay what would surely be an irreversible sale until after you have checked out a couple beginners' books on ham radio and shortwave listening from your local library, and read about ham radio and shortwave listening on the internet, and maybe find yourself a friendly ham or two (there are many) who will give you an in-person guided tour overview of the hobby as it exists today. (Are you even aware that Morse code is no longer a daunting requirement for any license class? And today there are communication modes and activity niches in the hobby that either didn't exist in your dad's time or were in their infancy.) By comparison to what your dad had to demonstrate competent knowledge of in order to get his ham license, today's ham licensing requirements are a joke! If you don't believe me, download for free and take a good look at the Technician Element 2 test question pool. Look, I'd understand if it didn't have any appeal or sentimental value to you, because Arnold Palmer himself couldn't have convinced me to take up golf merely because I came into possession of my late father's clubs. What I'm trying to say is, gone is gone forever, and were you to later regret that, it would take a lot of money to set up a station as nice. So, again, bottom line: know for certainty that disposing of it at old used pricing is the right thing to do, before you do it. If it is, count me among those who will gladly help by taking it off your hands. Source of council: Old fart, Extra Class, and knows a thing or two about regret."

Above this speed (standard on the bands is ~20WPM) there's no time to do that. You won't succeed while thinking about dits and dahs.   When you hear DAH-DIT-DIT-DIT and start to think: ""uhm that was -... which means it's letter B"", it means you've just missed another three letters.

amateurradio,3dmyov,MyrddinWyllt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:33:57 2015 UTC,"For an antenna, you can build one pretty easily with parts sourced mostly from whatever the Canadian equivalent of a Home Depot or Lowes is (hardware stores).   Mic is easy on eBay, or you can use a standard XLR mic with a PTT button wired in (will need it to be converted to whatever pinout your radio uses for mic, heil makes cables for a lot of radios that do XLR -> radio with built in PTT connector).  Power supply can be eBay, or QRZ or one of the Ham suppliers - may be a bit different in Canada, don't know if you have anything like HRO up there. Worst case, you can use a deep cycle marine battery and find a battery charger for it. Just operate until the battery gets low, go QRT and then recharge it.  Either way, it's do-able if you want it, you'll just have to squeeze here or there. What radio do you have?"

amateurradio,3dluxm,phpman,6,Fri Jul 17 09:12:37 2015 UTC,"With a ham license, you're not allowed to use your ham license for work.  If you talk to your coworker about non-work things, that is cool.  If you talk to your coworker about work things, that is prohibited. That is the licensing rule for the business band, which has nothing to do with amateur radio. GMRS has its own license, which is $85 per family. No exam.  Getting a ham license has nothing to do with GMRS, so the technician exam doesn't apply at all. This is generally considered unenforceable as the signal is identical on the air.  There have been no enforcement actions of this to date AFAIK.  But FCC fines start at $10k, so you should do some research and weigh the risks yourself.   I think you are confusing the amateur (ham) service, the GMRS service and the business band licensing. These three services have no overlap.  See the wiki for a comparison of ham and other two-radio radio services.  I hope this helps."

Sounds like you want a different (GMRS perhaps? I'm not knowledgeable) license if you want a work radio service, which requires certified devices. Unless you're a hobbyist, then in that case, Amateur radio would be perfect."
amateurradio,3dluxm,Redzapdos,2,Fri Jul 17 13:36:11 2015 UTC,"molo has this covered pretty well.  Public amateur band repeaters are usually open to whomever is licensed to use them, not just limited to the clubs. It's considered polite to join a club, or donate to them at least, if you use it regularly to help support the maintenance costs of the repeater.  I believe that the business band licensing is for certain frequencies in a certain area. This is separate from ham/amateur radio.  No exam for GMRS is required. I actually was under the impression that GMRS was illegal for business use, but some googlage suggests otherwise, TIL.  It's illegal to use the baofeng on GMRS. Do they care? Probably. Will you get caught? Unlikely, though the cheaper radios have been known to cause spurious emissions, which can get certain parties interested. It's a ""risk vs consequence"" type thing. Low risk of getting caught, but if you do it's a significant fine. Personally, I won't use non-certified devices on part 90 or part 95 services. I think that some UV-5R radios are part 90 certified, so can be used on business band, but check for the label."

In all honesty I will not be using my radios daily or even weekly. I think its worth the risk on FRS. I plan on using them car to car, so staying in one area will not be long, on vacation, or on a cruise. I think ill be safe :) If i was going to use daily i would not be using BaoFeng and would go the GMRS route.

amateurradio,3dkzy5,MegaCityBore,4,Fri Jul 17 03:24:35 2015 UTC,"I have the points of my inverted V pointed east and west, so it should be radiating in those directions.   FYI, this is backwards.

amateurradio,3dkzy5,Aegean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:48:07 2015 UTC,"Yes.  One thing to keep in mind though, is that the short path to some distant places like east Asia is over the poles from the US.  Even much of Europe is at at 45 degree bearing or less from the US east coast.  So you can certainly work good DX with an E-W dipole from here."

amateurradio,3dkzy5,ineedateam1,3,Fri Jul 17 22:54:28 2015 UTC,"Nobody's mentioned ""Sporadic E,"" so I will. So we are on the downhill side of the last sunspot cycle, and daily 10 meter openings won't be happening. Last summer and fall were actually pretty awesome on 10 as the last cycle had a 'second peak' that was pretty good.  For the next 5 or 6 years, we'll be left with Sporadic E, which doesn't depend on the sunspot cycle. It has it's own semi-annual cycle, peaking around the summer and winter solstice (June and December - guess when the 10-meter contests are scheduled). The E-layer is lower than the FM layer - it's about 60 miles up - so distances are shorter - 500 to 1500 miles. Double-hops are possible.   Away from the solstice peaks, Sporadic E can happen, but it'll be rare.   The 'Sporadic' part of the name is apt. It's unpredictable. Signals can be very strong, then disappear in seconds.  10 isn't the only band with E skip. It's hard to tell on 20, because ordinary F-Layer skip on 20 can cover mostly the same territory. On 15, 'short skip' - 500 - 800 miles - is more likely to be E than F. E hits 12 meters and 6 meters really well, too. It can happen on 2 meters and has been seen at 220 MHz (1.25 meters... nobody calls it that), but it's rare. I worked a Milwaukee repeater direct from North Carolina once, and everyone thought I was coming in on IRLP.   In the 'doldrums,' 10 meter fans try to gin up some local activity, and some areas get good local participation, usually around nets. Our club occasionally starts a 10 meter net following the nightly 2 meter net.   And I probably wouldn't call CQ-DX, unless you really only want stations outside the US (assuming you're in the US). If the band is open, domestic stations won't answer you, and with Sporadic E, you're more likely to reach domestic stations.   I use CB channel 19 as my propagation indicator (the beacons below 28.3 are good, too). If 27.185 is full of strong signals, 10 meters is open (and you should hear a few beacons). BUT, you might not hear any hams! Contest weekends prove that 10 is open more than we think,  but nobody's using it. Call CQ on 28.400. Some hams monitor it, waiting for activity to pop up.... But nobody transmits!  73, Gary KN4AQ"

The fact that you're hearing nothing may just mean the band is dead, but it's worth checking things out. I have the same radio, and I called cq for a long time before I realized the Mic was really almost dead (apparently a common issue with the stock Mic). So, I'd do some troubleshooting just to be reasonably certain you're getting out."
amateurradio,3dkzy5,KN4AQ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:44:41 2015 UTC,"Dead key of 0 watts (that seems wrong from my CB days, shouldn't I be getting a few watts of carrier? Or is it different because it's SSB?), swinging up to 20ish watts.  SWR is under 2 on all areas from 28.3-28.5. Didn't check in the CW/digital range."
amateurradio,3dkzy5,billybobwillyt,2,Fri Jul 17 15:48:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, on ssb you have no carrier so it only outputs power when it has a signal. Whistle into the mic when transmitting and you will see the meter swing."
amateurradio,3dkzy5,billybobwillyt,2,Fri Jul 17 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"On SSB, there should be no power - zero watts - if you're not talking. The carrier should be completely gone. That's true on CB, too, though some radios had some kind of hybrid ""reduced carrier"" mode. Ham radio doesn't use anything like that.   Many radios also don't put out a carrier in CW mode by keying a mic. They need a key connected. My ICOM 756 and 7000 (and 706) are all like that. To get a full-power carrier from a mic-keyup, I need to be in RTTY mode."

amateurradio,3di521,abacon15,32,Thu Jul 16 13:40:01 2015 UTC,"Take a look at this surface analysis. Remember that configuration. In the summer in the eastern US, that's the configuration that will give you great tropo openings. A big northern ""cut off"" high pressure system, another high over the gulf, and a long, strung out stationary front in between. Along that front, there's an extended, continuous temperature inversion were warm air is climbing up on top of cold air.   That's where tropo likes to happen, in those elevated warm layers of air. You'll see tropo during similar configurations during the winter, but not as frequently, because surface heating  and radiation cooling is moderated by snow cover and precipitation. If you see a big ice storm in the forecast, assume you'll have a good tropo opening during the storm, as ice storms are almost always the product of a thermal inversion.  There's additional tropo north of that front because the northern high is a Canadian airmass, so it's cool and dry, but it's also fairly large and not especially intense, so winds across much of the airmass are relatively calm. This allows for maximum radiation cooling of the surface over night, but the air a few thousand feet above the surface can't cool nearly as quickly. This forms a pool of cold air right at the surface, and an elevated warm layer, an inversion.   Sometimes, when the sun comes up and the surface begins to warm again, you end up with a sandwich, warm air at the surface, cooler air a few thousand feet above the surface (because the cool air right above the surface can't warm up as fast as the surface), then that original layer of warm air left over from the inversion the previous night, then cooler air on top due to normal atmospheric cooling.  The intensifying warm layer at the surface can push up on the layers above it, increasing their elevation, and making them prime candidates for tropospheric ducting.  EDIT: Cool teaching opportunity! If you click here, it will take you to the weather model for 8am EDT today (2 hours ago). Click anywhere on the map that you also see reports of tropospheric ducting in OP's original link, and you'll notice a common feature.  What pops up is called a SKEW-T, and it's a plot of wind, temperature, and dew point with height. It's what a weather balloon produces. The red line on the right is temperature, and the green line is dew point. The right side of the scale is warmer (and wetter) the left side is cooler (and dryer).   You'll notice a common feature in nearly all of the areas that are reporting good tropospheric ducting: A bulge, which I've circled in the SKEW-T from central Indiana. This bulge is at about 2,000 meters, or 6,500 feet above sea level, and it indicates warming air with height, and shows a layer of warm, dry air trapped between colder layers. It's most pronounced there in Indiana, but you can find it to some degree across a huge swath of the Great Lakes and eastern US in the model I linked to.  Once you've clicked on a point and found an inversion in the SKEW-T, you can click on the arrow above the image that says ""[+01]"" to see how the inversion evolves with time, or go back in time a couple hours to see how it started.   If you want to go way back in time even further, you can click here to go to a model run from 8pm EDT last night. You can drag the little pointer around on the map and click ""Plot New Sounding"" to change locations, and you can see how the airmass will evolve between 8pm yesterday and about 2pm today, where that model run stopped (it calculates 18 hours of weather at a time)."

Part of the actual research that was going on at HAARP was related to this.  The idea was to use the upper atmosphere to propagate encoded signals globally in case communications satellites went down.  Obviously some huge differences but a similar idea.
amateurradio,3di521,molo1134,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:34:02 2015 UTC,"ULF signals go right through the earth and oceans.  The wavelengths are too large for tropospheric ducting.  Using the upper atmosphere to propagate signals globally is what we call 'skywave', and it mainly works on HF, not ULF.  I think you may be thinking of the Schumann resonances?"

Hamwan is ~2000 miles away, requires special hardware and a ham license. You also can't use encryption. Hamnet's map is down, and again, it requires specific hardware and software.   I want to contact people (or have them contact me), not join a network. Those mesh networks are limited because they have special requirements that no one 1) knows about and 2) cares to meet.

Also, it's not just hamwan that restricts encryption, it's the FCC, so you couldn't use it if you're using your Part 97 privileges either.  If you're staying in the Part 15 rules, have at it, just stay under 1W EIRP.  If you want to make a true qso on 2.4GHz, build a modulator for that band and do voice or CW.  Having someone connect to your AP and hit a webpage is pretty much identical to what BBHN does.  If you're just looking to build a publicly accessible access-point, again, have at it, you may get some interesting results, but I don't know that I would call it a qso.  I do something similar in that I provide free internet access to my neighborhood via a 4' tall 9dBi antenna in my attic connected to a Cisco 1242 AP, so that all the kids that have tablets can get together outside but still enjoy their games (it's also the same reason I run a Minecraft server for them).

You need two things:     Micro JST 1.5 ZH 6-Pin   5v TTL USB-Serial adapter   The JST connector is available from eBay (from Hong Kong) with cables already crimped in. You can get regular connectors from Digikey but crimping sucks. Hong Kong seems to only sell them in 10 packs but it's only $6.  I used a Sparkfun FTDI breakout because I had some laying around. You can use whatever you want.  The place you plug in to on the radio is on the bottom under the rubber circle thing. You'll have to pry it off (it's lightly glued on) and plug in to the exposed JST connector. It's kind of sloppy but CAT control was a new feature when the radio was made.  I'll have to dig up the pinout. I have it written somewhere. You can probably find it online."

If you pay attention to the labeling (RXI, TXO, GND) on the purple FTDI breakout you can trace the cabling back to the radio and get an idea of the pinout.  edit: The TS-50 doesn't have much in the way of CAT control. You can change freq and mode but I don't think you can ""auto tune"" and activate the antenna tuner. You still have to do that with the button on the radio."

amateurradio,3dhxfi,CyFus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:58 2015 UTC,Even when the first VHF TV was coming out they'd use twin lead especially for budget installs. My grandma ran her TV setup like that well into the 90's... wasn't great reception but it worked.

amateurradio,3dhxfi,CyFus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:26:54 2015 UTC,how would putting that 300ohm twin lead in a metal conduit affect it? wouldn't it sort of act like a coax cable but with two wires instead of one inside?
amateurradio,3dhxfi,CyFus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:32:01 2015 UTC,WIth coax the shielding is also the ground - if you ran twin lead up a metal conduit you'd have your ground running inside the conduit as well. So for reception it would probably work just fine but if you used it for a transmitter the conduit would couple or become a parasitic radiator... unless I suppose you impedance matched the output on the antenna side of the conduit.
amateurradio,3dhxfi,avtomatkournikova,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:36:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was common here.

amateurradio,3dedrd,LegoGuy23,34,Wed Jul 15 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"Re: Report  Rule 4 in this sub was not violated. It's understood that license data in the US is public record and can be easily searched. OP knowingly associated their callsign with their username in this subreddit. OP also posted their callsign in the body of this thread.   When it comes to violating the general rules of reddit, according the admins, it's still allowed because the information is not being used to harass or harm people or places. We've talked about this subject with the admins and they allowed it unless it's used to harass.   However, If someone other than OP was releasing information with out the permission of OP then it would be in violation."

amateurradio,3dedrd,OffissaPup,2,Wed Jul 15 22:45:15 2015 UTC,Do not know how many countries can select their own call sign. In Australia you can put down a few preference with the most preferred as #1 when you apply for a license but it costs an extra $20 compared to taking the next sequential.  Some do a search on the acma web site sometime for the testing session. Last time I drove someone to be tested all preferred call signs where checked to see if they were free or not while the final paper work was being filled out. As far as I am aware all people who tested that day got their preferred call signs.

amateurradio,3dh44l,Shadyman,2,Thu Jul 16 06:11:40 2015 UTC,"I sent IC an email already, I should probably do the same with RAC to cover my bases.  The ARRL basically says 'you can operate in Canada without an additional license, but you have to abide by Canadian regulations', which seems harmless enough at first glance but is certainly not untrue.  The RAC page on CEPT permits restates the 'donut hole' in current IC regulations word for word.  While the US isn't covered under CEPT in Canada, I did notice that while Canada did sign the amended CEPT regulations that dropped the Morse code requirement and consolidated all permit holders into one class, the relevant Industry Canada regulations on CEPT have not been updated to reflect this.  So if you take a look at page 8 of the CEPT guidelines PDF, you'll see this footnote after Canada's entry:   17 The requirement for Morse code proficiency was removed from T/R 61-01 on 15 September 2003. Since then, the equivalence between the CEPT Licence and the national licence of this country is in the process of being re-established. (emphasis added)"

This means the little slice of 10m for Technicians, and the General band edges. IIRC we're not allowed to operate outside the US band limits despite being in Canada, so make sure you're legal."

Please do note that RBR4 3.1 isn't specific to amateurs visiting from the USA, it's for ALL foreign amateurs, and not every country dropped morse as a requirement at the same time. I am surprised not to see a separate document specific to Canada & USA giving a US-to-Canada licence grade conversion chart though.  Do also note that Industry Canada doesn't give a rat's behind about the amateur service because it makes them zero money and they have suffered such cutbacks that they just don't have time to bother with what they see as non-critical.

amateurradio,3dgvja,molo1134,2,Thu Jul 16 05:07:26 2015 UTC,"You're correct that 6m on a HT antenna is a big compromise.  You're definitely warming up the antenna.

Keep in mind that your submersion rated radio is still going to sink like a stone if you drop it into the water, meaning you'll ideally want to tether it to the kayak or yourself.  In that case, there are plenty of radios that are dust and weather resistant that will handle being splashed with water just fine."

Based on the JA-model (no 220) VX-8DR I own. 6m is FM (@5W-0.05W) and AM (@1W). APRS is built-in, no getting around it. The GPS unit is optional, buy the add-on module if you only want it."

amateurradio,3dg5pl,zeryl,4,Thu Jul 16 00:39:35 2015 UTC,The CAT control will work because it's just a serial UART. What is less guaranteed to work is any built in USB audio CODEC.  I have an IC-7200 and can confirm that it's USB->UART chip and USB audio CODEC work out of the box with no problems (and on Debian with no configuration).

I don't contest so I don't know if there is some miraculous auto logging software that runs on windows that uses cat. you might be able to run it with wine.

amateurradio,3df1pb,monkeyhamsandwhich,9,Wed Jul 15 19:35:33 2015 UTC,"It may well be a cellular jammer. The transistors in line with the antenna appear to be BT09VG GaAsFETs, which are wide band, low power RF amplifier transistors that can operate from 5MHz-4GHz. The two antennas makes me think it may be aimed specifically at Wifi or cellular systems. Range will be quite limited, as they almost certainly are putting out 250mW or less. It might be loud enough to render cellphones within perhaps a 300 meter radius deaf, assuming good line of sight to the device, and poor line of sight to a cell repeater.  Without a frequency counter, there's no easy way to know where it's transmitting, though you could always just power it up and see if your cell service dies.  Please be advised, it is entirely illegal in almost all circumstances to use this device in the United States. Folks have been hit with enormous fines, and I believe in at least one instance, even got jail time for malicious use of these devices. Cell providers (and other users who have spectrum near the cell bands) can see degradation from those jammers, and they will try and track it down if they can."

It was also jamming some first responders communications too and I seem to recall that he was tracked down and first asked politely to stop, but refused citing safety concerns.  Then the FCC came down on him like a ton of bricks and he's now either in jail or paying a fine for the rest of his life... I can't recall exactly, but that was the gist of it..."

amateurradio,3df8ev,ke4ke,9,Thu Jul 16 15:37:09 2015 UTC,"/AE  Full story, in March/April I started getting really excited about building a quadcopter. I've dabbled in R/C before, fixed wing and single rotor, and finally decided I'd give a quad a shot. I start doing research into it and look at the FPV (first person view) camera systems for it, and start finding that some of them you need to be licensed for. ""What the hell"", I say and look into getting licensed. Take a practice test and got close enough I figured it would be no effort. Started getting bored with it, so figured I'd give general a shot. Same thing, was pretty much close enough I studied a little and got close enough I was confident.   I finish my prep for general a week out and realize I'm kind of bored and might as well give extra a shot. Oh, man. To say there's a big gap in terms of testing at general versus extra is an understatement. I cram and I cram. I take practice test after practice test varying between 70% and 80%, depending on the questions. I watch videos on YouTube, the whole thing. I cram and cram until the Friday before the test I basically say ""screw it, I know what I know"".  So I walk into the test site on a Saturday morning, sheepishly mention I'm definitely going for my tech and general and underplay my prospects of extra (""yeah, might give it a shot, who knows, it's no extra cost!""). I take tech, breeze through it. They ask if I want general. Of course, I'm ready for this. Breeze through it. No big deal. Get to extra. Oh man, those 50 questions are a lot, there are some things I don't remember or never learned. ""What do the different diodes do?"", I can never remember. Sheepishly hand it in.   After grading they kind of shake their heads. ""You missed it by one question. We have another form, so you can take it again if you want. You're close enough, you might as well try"". I say sure, why not. I put enough effort into it at this point, why walk away empty handed.  Second test, I feel like I know most of them, but there are still some that I just don't quite understand, that I didn't prep, and some of the more esoteric math formulas I didn't get. But I had this, I knew I got it.  I turned it in. I hear a chuckle from the VEs. They pull me outside and explain that I missed it by one question and they don't have another version of the test so I won't be able to do it again that day.  Crushing.  At Field Day, I ended up meeting with the club and partaking in the festivities. They mention testing again and I realized they were doing it again in two weeks. So with the combined efforts of studying and actual experience on the air and operating, I was able to take the test this Saturday and score a 90.  So now I just get to wait for ULS to update and then submit for a vanity. There's no way I'm sticking with a 2x3 after I went through that effort.  tl;dr Got my extra on the third try after the first two attempts were 1 question short."
amateurradio,3df8ev,KE0EHK,2,Thu Jul 16 00:01:57 2015 UTC,"Nice job! Extra is definitely more intimidating than General and a lot harder to cram for, I know I personally spent the most time relearning some of the math/physics concepts I hadn't used in over a decade when studying. I even went out and bought a scientific calculator for the test because in flashcards and practice tests I was still having to pull out my phone to work through something. Went through the whole test, missed only one or two and never even  turned the calculator on once. (It did replace my old $2 staples calculator at work) That feeling you get when you realize that you really understand the material and test goes from scary to easy is almost as good as getting to use the new privileges."

The only think I really planned to do was work some of the SKCC Weekend Sprintathon since I had lawn and garden items to attend to.    Saturday morning, coffee and made a few contacts on the WES. After weekend chores, decided to arrange my back porch antenna and hook it up to my analyzer to find the best settings. Idea was to bring out my portable setup and work the sprint, have a beer, and watch the sun set. A nice relaxing evening was what I had in mind. Imgur Pic When I sat down to operate 20m, it was all signals from the IARU contest (that I totally forgot about.) Swapped my straight key for my bug and made 44 qrp/portable contacts over about three hours. Bleeding ears and a headache resulted. Sunday, recovered from the headache and did more WES. And... yesterday was the NAQCC sprint - did that too and got 34 qrp contacts.   Spread out amongst the week was a contact to St. Pierre & Miquelon and one to the United Arab Emirates.

Got two ATNOs: OH0X, Eastern Aland Islands (between Finland and Sweden), and E51RAT, South Cook Islands. Got the latter just by blind luck during a S&P jog up and down 20 meters, and caught him just as he was coming on the air before being spotted. Got him first try. Shortly afterward, he was bombarded by pretty much the entire Americas. SO-50. Did one pass on Saturday night at 11:40 pm local time, in which I got my first DX QSO via satellite (DS1BWU in Korea). Afterward, there was literally no one else on the bird, so I turned it into a practice session to see how long I could stay locked onto it by calling CQ over and over. I had it full quieting all the way to LOS. The next day I worked it again at midday and got two more contacts, although both of them I've already worked before. There seem to be a bunch of weekend regulars I hear almost every pass. 2m SSB. Worked a guy in Okayama Prefecture 76 km (47 miles) mobile from my truck. That was a bit unexpected, usually I don't get such distances with a vertically polarized antenna. Must have been a tropo event that morning. 6m SSTV.

Must put that thing back up sometime. The SSTV decode was done with the 20m doublet, which as you might imagine is a mess of nulls when tuned for 6.  I also have 6m mobile with a vertical antenna on the truck I switch out, but that's not going to get far."

You have to run the separate speaker cable to the Signalink since there is no audio out on the mic Jack but it's a fair trade-off for me to be able to use both the signalink and CAT control simultaneously.

Kenwood TM-710A with the Green Light Labs GPS module:  http://imgur.com/z0duQZR  Radio Jesus truly smiled upon me when routing power through the firewall.  There was a big grommet on the passenger side right behind the glove box.  The weird thing is that there was that, in addition to the normal nipple on the grommet that was occupied, there was a mutant nipple off to the side at a bit of an angle with nothing in it.  Only had to cut a tiny bit of the tip off to get the wiring through it.  On the passenger compartment side, it was located just above the outer passenger side floor trim, so it was really easy to dip in to that as well.  For the moment I'm running with a mag-mount antenna, until I can figure out how to get through the headliner and not set off any of the many airbags.  Even with a compromise antenna, it's still night and day compared to running one of the cheap HTs!"

I had to make my own grommet hole, it was a bit scary. Luckily someone else in the Subaru Outback forums found a great / easy to access spot to drill through.   I used a lip-mount antenna with small-pass-through wire on my hatchback. My radio is ""mounted"" under the driver side seat (since the power comes through under the steering wheel area)."

Sometimes it pays to stare and crawl around for awhile before you decide on how to route the power, as it took a good bit of time before I found it.  Funny enough, I used to install vehicle tracking systems in EMS vehicles, so I went in thinking that this would be pretty easy.  Boy was I wrong.  There's a huge difference between installing in an ambulance with giant areas for access vs a late model passenger vehicle with barely any room!

amateurradio,3dc2yk,kawfey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:54:15 2015 UTC,"If this spacecraft's hardware and software could be instantaneously updated with today's technology, would there be obvious design changes?   The software does and has been updated. That is a huge advantage to building a SDR-based architecture. There are many instances of missions being salvaged by clever software engineering.  Did you know that both of Voyager 2's radio receivers failed a month after launch? We are still talking to it today thanks to clever software engineering, and it was built with 70's tech.  More recently, the Galileo mission suffered a failure to deploy the main antenna and was salvaged by software updates to the radio driving the low gain antenna, increasing its datarate by a factor of 10. That one we crashed into Jupiter though.  I cannot really speak for the hardware side other than to speculate; we certainly have ADCs and DACs that are higher performance than the ones selected for this hardware. We have clocks that are more reliable; computers that are more powerful, etc. Not to mention the advancements in rugged solid state storage - something of huge importance for flybys where you have to do data collection very rapidly. I understand that New Horizons only had 8GB of storage; it seems to me that they could have added more had they needed; most probably this was more than enough to hold the complete set of data their instruments could generate through the encounter. But we certainly could have produced and stored more data with current tech."

There are a lot better options today. You can get a low power ublox module that gives the same level of data and using much less power for similar pricing ( < 10$ )"
amateurradio,3ddgds,DeathByFarts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:28:59 2015 UTC,APRS is certainly an obvious use. However if you can crack it open and tap out a 1pps (one pulse per second) signal then it would be possible to build a GPS locked oscillator around it.
amateurradio,3ddgds,VK2DDS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:24:51 2015 UTC,Might be better to get a 10 MHz signal out of it.  Easier to build PLLs for RF use at that frequency range.  And some chips produce the 10MHz output.
amateurradio,3ddgds,molo1134,2,Wed Jul 15 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"The 1pps signal typically goes into a FLL, the multiplication factor is way too high for a PLL. Typical homebrew solutions involve gating a frequency counter and adjusting a PWM signal if there's an error. The PWM gets filtered and fed into a varicap diode that trims up a crystal oscillator. Whole thing can easily be done on any old cheap microcontroller :).  1ppm accuracy is easy to get. Longer gate periods can be used for higher accuracy. It's very poor compared to a commercial GPSDO or rubidium oscillator but it's also very cheap and easy to build."
amateurradio,3ddgds,VK2DDS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:24:33 2015 UTC,Some of the satellite (and probably VHF+) ops use GPS units to activate two or sometimes even four grid squares at the same time. I think you have to have a GPS to do document (via pictures) that you were on the right coordinates. VHF and satellite stations collect grid squares for awards.
amateurradio,3ddgds,JBstrikesagain,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"Back before i joined the Navy I worked for a coal mining engineering firm in Eastern KY (this was back in 2000-2002).  We had handheld GPS units like this one, and we used them to go out to gas wells in the field up in the mountains of eastern KY, get their coordinates, and then bring the coords back to the office and plot on our maps via Auto-CAD.    Back then in the early 2000's, there was still error placed in GPS signals by the government so if you wanted precise (within a few feet) Lat and Long, you had to stand in the area you needed the coords, and let the little handheld GPS ""average"" the location for several minutes.  Not a ham radio use for the device, but it did bring back memories of when i was a young guy fresh out of college in my first job :)"
amateurradio,3ddgds,HealzFault,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:09:23 2015 UTC,Even with the accuracy of modern receivers unless you have RTK (or other name brand service) correction you still want averaging if precision matters... Last summer I was in the field for a work project and had to survey the path of an irrigators swing arm wheels around a field. Since we were studying the viability of different survey methods I got to walk the path with a survey handheld using only DGPS and Mark every 10 paces using 20 measurement readings (the luckier guy got to walk the same path using a proper RTK rover receiver which takes readings with greater speed and accuracy)

amateurradio,3dfkos,hobbycollector,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:25:48 2015 UTC,"nah this is a good baseline beginner setup. I don't think dummy loads are critical any more. More of a boatanchor/tube radio thing.  Also I dislike antenna analyzers because they encourage people to chase the match, not the efficiency.  I would like to suggest, if you are going to crack a radio and align or adjust, to pick up a full set of the non-conductive, non-magnetic adjustment sticks. Basically plastic screwdrivers with various heads for twiddling inductor cores and trimmer caps. Very useful and saves you a bunch of time and cussing with chopsticks and X-acto knives."
amateurradio,3dfkos,jonny290,3,Wed Jul 15 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"Also I dislike antenna analyzers because they encourage people to chase the match, not the efficiency.   I think you mean antenna tuners, in which case I agree.  I like dummy loads because you can use them to check cable. Continuity isn't nearly enough for a good cable. If you connect one end to the dummy load and the other end to the antenna analyzer, you can check that you get 50 ohms and 1:1 swr across the band of interest."
amateurradio,3dfkos,MyrddinWyllt,2,Wed Jul 15 22:27:31 2015 UTC,Solid point. Reversing my opinion.
amateurradio,3dfkos,dan_kb6nu,2,Wed Jul 15 22:36:59 2015 UTC,"Guess it depends on your goals. External SWR meter isn't really required, nor is the dummy load. If you're doing work inside the radio, yeah a lot of this would be nice."
amateurradio,3dfkos,MyrddinWyllt,3,Wed Jul 15 22:14:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree 100% about the dummy load. If you run into a problem where you just don't seem to be transmitting, hooking a dummy load up to your radio is the quickest way to determine if the problem is with the radio or the antenna system. And, as someone pointed out above, they can also be used to find bad coax/connectors. They're inexpensive, too."
amateurradio,3dfkos,molo1134,2,Thu Jul 16 02:47:47 2015 UTC,You should get one eventually. Not something you need just starting out. HF is expensive enough as it is.
amateurradio,3dfkos,gorkish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:01:10 2015 UTC,I bought a swr/power meter and dummy load in order to test used HF radios before purchase.  Very worthwhile.
amateurradio,3dfkos,molo1134,2,Thu Jul 16 13:51:15 2015 UTC,"I use a dummy load very often, and I assure you I am working with extremely modern gear. If you are going to build, test, or repair anything you will need 50 ohm loads. They are helpful for many things other than tuning up tube finals.  Edit: plus they are pretty cheap. You can get a lot of bang for your buck here."

The FX4 had issues and when they fixed it, they made so many compromises and it's a poor looking radio that's meant for CW but has no built in filtering and they ship it with a filtering kit (unassembled) from another vendor.  I think the LD has DSP filtering, but it's bizarre moves like that which make me wonder about the rest of their radios.  And the mountain topper, their most popular, isn't their design.

amateurradio,3dc4ui,ODuffer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"Well the USB is 5 volts, the battery is 3.7 volts and it needs a charger circuit so it doesn't overcharge. The protection circuit on the battery is sort of worthless so its not safe to just throw voltage on it without some kind of logic. And the radio is 7.4 volt so it won't work on a single cell.   I can't find a circuit that can take 5V and directly turn it into 7.4 with a battery charger circuit so i'm experimenting with the converter however the converter's power requirements stop at 3.2 volts so it seems like it may not be able to handle the full discharge rate of the cell.  But i'll find a solution eventually"

amateurradio,3dcnpx,scubascratch,5,Wed Jul 15 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"Modifying a Part 15 device would void its certification so operating it would be questionable. Selling it in that state would definitely be illegal without re-certification. But as long as it's a one-off device operating in a Part 15 spectrum I can't imagine much harm being done. I think there's an exemption for small number of devices being used as prototypes/testing but you'd need a lawyer to determine whether this particular use qualifies.  Basically, in the context of Part 15 ""unlicensed"" refers to the operator not the device. In other words, Part 15 lets your grandma use an off-the-shelf certified wifi router without a license. The device has to be certified, but grandma doesn't.  Meanwhile Part 97, the amateur radio service, allows licensed operators (hams) to use potentially uncertified devices.

So I guess you can call it a sniffer. I'm a network guy by trade and I have only tuned these repeaters a hand full of times. I'll find a pic of one being used for you.

Take a look below and tell me if there is anything I am missing.   My HT, Kenwood D72a and a UV-5r backup. ""Easy Digi"" box. iPhone plus SSTV app. Going to build the Tape measure Yagi tomorrow.   For those that have done this, should I bother with Tripod mounting the yagi?  I'm concerned I will not be able to get the articulation I need throughout the contact.  But I'm also worried about trying to change channels to account for the doppler if I'm holding the antenna and monitoring the iPhone.    Any recommendations?"
amateurradio,3da3vc,Chillyhead,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:34 2015 UTC,"How does the ""Easy Digi"" box work? I looked at this: http://forums.qrz.com/showthread.php?309374-The-KF5INZ-quot-Easy-Digi-quot-digital-mode-interface-for-sound-card-modes  ""Nothing new about this technology, it consists of two 600 ohm line transformers for audio input and output from your pc to your transceiver, and an opto-coupled push to talk circuit that works off of an RS-232 port on your computer.""  But if you're using an iPhone, not a PC, how does this help at all?  I just take the audio out of my radio and put it directly into the line in/mic input of my PC and record/decode it right there. No need for this box since I'm only receiving and not activating a TX circuit or sending audio to the radio. If you have it, and you know it works, fine, but I still don't see how you're using it with an iPhone.  As for doppler, you will only need to account for that if it's a near overhead pass, and even then, when I adjusted for it it didn't seem to affect the SSTV decoding. If it's a big worry about managing all this stuff at the same time I would just leave the radio on the center frequency. Alternatively you can just record the audio and decode it later.  I would say the ability to change the antenna's orientation might not be as important when they do SSTV than when they do voice contacts or packet contacts. The radio they use for SSTV puts out 25 watts while the radio[s?] they use for packet/voice usually are 5 watts. And again, for lower elevation passes you don't need to compensate for doppler at all.  I would spend most of your time working on building that tape measure yagi. It will help a lot. Then test it out by listening to packet tomorrow on 14.825. It's on almost 24/7 and it's 5 watts so if you can hear it well you'll be fine for the SSTV."

On the other hand, signal strength depends on the ability of the antenna at that frequency.  The antenna gain compares to a resonant half-wave dipole.  An HF dipole receives a lot more photons than an X-Band dipole.  This signal on the feed line will be a lot less.  Assuming it's proportional to wavelength squared [ref], it'll be about a factor of a million less, so include -60 dB.  That puts the signal at comparable to -144 dBm @ HF, way less than S1.

Am I going to have to choose a carrier light for only one mode, or insert three leds, each running from different chips??!?!!  Step 3:  The picture in my post shows the 10489 chip in the top left corner, and this page shows where a discriminator tap is located for this model.  http://www.discriminator.nl/ubc9000xlt/index-en.html  The big white connector at the bottom of this image...   http://www.discriminator.nl/ubc9000xlt/location.jpg  ...goes to the actual squelch knob.

Step 5: Still not knowing if it is indeed even possible to get a carrier light led that works on all modes, but at least knowing what part of the circuit board it will be if such a tap location exists, I get my multimeter and try a bunch of places.  Step 6: Success at finding a place right in the middle of my playing area that is 0V when scanning, and 5V when squelch is broken.  Insert led and test to see if there are any adverse consequences. None found.  Appears to work on WFM, NFM and AM equally well.  Drill hole in front of cabinet, insert led, tidy things up, close box, do more testing for 24 hours, figure I should mention it on the net in case anyone else wants to do the same in the future.  The volume control is also attached via that white connector. We're in the audio part of the radio at that location.

I added a 400W A/C inverter and hooked up a little 5v regulator into some USB ports... so I have 120VAC, 12VDC and 4x 5VDC USB ports.  Nice work on your build!"

amateurradio,3ddyb0,MyrddinWyllt,-2,Wed Jul 15 14:59:37 2015 UTC,I've posted a comment on my original post for you to view
amateurradio,3ddyb0,hamsterdave,6,Wed Jul 15 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"You won't get a lot of support from a community of relatively tech-savvy folks with nothing but a hand wave and a ""I've got a great idea, email address please!"".  I'd also point out that, considering there are more hams now than at any point in the history of the hobby, and it's growing at an unprecedented rate, and technology is progressing at a similarly unprecedented rate, claiming you can offer a rebirth/revitalization with an app is a big claim. Backing it up might be tough."
amateurradio,3ddyb0,hamsterdave,-4,Wed Jul 15 15:05:27 2015 UTC,"Perhaps this group is not the right audience, but I am looking for an audience. I certainly can understand that giving your email seems like a difficult thing to ask so I will consider other options.  I am glad to hear that the hobby is growing. My goal is not so much to take over the hobby, but to provide a newer version that the younger generation would use similar to the current hobbyist. The younger generations could find a use to this style of communication; however, they are probably less likely to take in the hobby of becoming tech-savvy since each year kids are becoming more and more impatience.  What do you think?"
amateurradio,3ddyb0,jakkarth,11,Wed Jul 15 15:14:43 2015 UTC,"My complaint is not with your goal, but with your presentation. Put together a project outline, a slide show, something that gives at least an inkling to where you want to go. Then people might be willing to pony up their email address and some of their time to help.  However, in regards to your proposal, I think you're working from an old (and very stubborn) paradigm, in large part. The hobby is rapidly becoming younger, and evidence seems to suggest it is currently seeing one of the largest influxes of young people since the late 40s.  It is my personal experience that the perception held by many hams that kids today are simply too impatient and disinterested is inherently and wildly false. I think most hams are bad at public speaking, most groups who attempt to recruit are using outdated materials, and they're out of touch with the current youth culture. They're also often working from a model of school that they know from their youth. This is not how successful schools operate any more.  This shouldn't be surprising, it happens to every generation.  When you get people who have good interpersonal skills, are good at public speaking and at teaching in an engaging fashion, and who are young (mentally) enough to relate on some level, I've found that kids today are very interested. I've had spectacularly good luck working with the Boy Scouts of America in two different regions in the last 8 years, bringing more than 2 dozen teenagers in to the hobby in that time. You put those kids on a radio during a contest, and they'll work most of us OMs under the table. They are perfectly capable of focusing on something they are interested in.  Our problem is not the kids. Our problem is us.  We all got old while we weren't looking."
amateurradio,3ddyb0,ShiftBit,-2,Wed Jul 15 15:35:23 2015 UTC,"Where I want to go, is where voice communication is encouraged over text and images. I am searching in a few different groups to see where is the interest in helping shape this future. You alluded to the fact that hams are bad at public speaking. I would guess this is because a lot of the time speaking is behind a mic so its not comfortable being out in the open. If you this is true, then the youth culture to be on facebook, twitter, instagram all day... no talking involved will mean we increase the chance that the future generations struggle with talking cause they're behind their smartphone social media accounts."
amateurradio,3ddyb0,jakkarth,5,Wed Jul 15 15:56:44 2015 UTC,"No offence, but without knowing what your idea is I'm not going to give you my email address or spend my time filling out a survey."

I wanna know more about what you love and hate about HAM and CB Radio so that I incorporate your ideas into the app.  What do you think? Or do you have any questions?"
amateurradio,3ddyb0,molo1134,5,Wed Jul 15 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"The main draw of ham radio, from my point of view, is that it doesn't rely on telephony infrastructure. I can talk to people on other continents with gear I can make myself and carry in a backpack on a hike. A cell phone app to do much the same thing is included with every cell phone: it's the phone app. Hams that want to do ham-like activities on their phone can use one of many echolink apps already available. Your idea doesn't sound like it would interest me at all, and I don't see how it would help spark interest in ham.  I don't use CB, but I'd imagine they're mostly in the same boat. There's nothing I particularly dislike about ham radio, so I can't be of much help to you there.  Sorry to be so blunt. Thank you for clarifying your position. Good luck with your project!"
amateurradio,3ddyb0,molo1134,-1,Wed Jul 15 15:12:54 2015 UTC,"I'm grateful to get your feedback. Using a phone app is not quite the same as using a HAM radio, but I can understand that the use of radio network over telephony/data is appealing to the current HAM radio users.  My main goal is not to spark interest in the HAM radio hobby, but to help grow the community of users who would rather talk to real life people through a radio-like app versus typing on their phones and viewing pictures (like Facebook, Instagram, Twiiter).  Thanks again for your feedback."
amateurradio,3ddyb0,MyrddinWyllt,5,Wed Jul 15 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"So, you're uninterested in 95% of what ham is about? Ham radio is about learning how radios work and signals bounce around the globe. It's about learning the basics of electronics and soldering up your own kits. It's about learning how to talk via satellites and space stations. It's about picking the right frequency for the job at hand, tuning the radio to make out the faintest signal. It's about talking by voice, and by Morse code, and transmitting digital information and pictures. It's about making reliable internet links across hundreds of miles into the middle of nowhere. It's about building your own antennas and trying out new designs. It's about packing your radio gear into a backpack and climbing a mountain to see who you can contact. It's about tracking weather balloons and near-space photography experiments. It's about providing communications for events, like festivals and marathons, and for disasters like storms and earthquakes. It's about building groups of people that are active in their communities. It's about the excitement of seeing how many different countries you can contact in a single day, and seeing what the furthest station you can reach is. It's about making human contact over hundreds of miles on a single AA battery.  And yeah, sometimes it's about chatting with your friends when you're in a geographically similar area. That sounds like all your idea is interested in. Since we already have 2-person communications on our phones, it sounds like the only benefit to using your app would be to A, talk to strangers, or B, have a group of people voice chatting at once. Group voice chat apps already exist, so I guess what you're going for is Omegle but voice-only?  As for getting kids interested in stuff like this, I think that ham already fulfills that goal quite well, and as a bonus it includes the 95% of stuff I barely scratched the surface of in my first paragraph. Cell phones aren't new technology. They're built on top of the foundation of basic radio principles that ham radio pioneered, and use the same circuit designs in many cases. Innovation in voice communication technology is largely driven by ham radio operators who are experimenting with new ideas.  Again, I'm not trying to talk you out of your idea. I wish you much success with your project. I just feel it's a bit misguided when ham has so much more to offer in my opinion :)"

amateurradio,3d8ooa,experiential,4,Tue Jul 14 11:04:31 2015 UTC,"I have a Yaesu FT-8900R attached to a cheap, multiband magmount installed in my daily driver (2003 Civic).  I specifically wanted a transceiver with a removable control head so I could locate the actual transceiver component in the trunk and mount the control head in the empty stereo DIN slot (JVC stereo replaced junky Honda stereo).  I've had it installed this way for over two years and haven't encountered any issues.  My club operates a fairly extensive repeater system in GA and SC.  While mobile, I can communicate through our primary repeater from just about any location within the area encompassed within Elberton, GA; Greenwood, SC; Barnwell, SC; and Wrens, GA.  We get a lot of stations using that repeater from well outside of that area, as well, so there usually several interesting people with whom to speak during my travels within that area.  During my frequent road trips up and down the Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard, I've found many people to speak with through the various repeaters along those routes and simplex frequencies.  It's been useful to learn about road construction well before I've come across it, what restaurants and fuel stations are good when I stop in an area, and just to have a few minutes of ragchewing while traveling.  I also encounter a lot of 6m and 10m repeaters in the areas I visit, so having that capability is nice.  The 8900 is also interesting since it enabled me to listen to the aviation band, business band, and public safety band.  Although many departments use trunked digital systems now, there are many which don't, particularly in rural areas.  Overall, while it certainly isn't the best mobile radio available, I've thoroughly enjoyed it while driving.  A SDR transceiver that's integrated with an embedded mobile platform would be incredible.  I already have a great deal of fun with my RTL-SDR dongle and HP tablet.  A handheld, QRP, two-way communications platform would be even more fun."
amateurradio,3d8ooa,agentace,3,Tue Jul 14 11:47:14 2015 UTC,"who do you talk to while driving?   Here in Wichita, Ks, there's a simplex ""net"" (I use the term loosely) every weekday afternoon from 4:30 to about 6:30.  A local ham with a really nice 2m base station runs it.  Anywhere from 2 to 15 people check in daily.  Some are base, some are mobile, at least one is out on his afternoon walk, every time.  Not everyone can hear everyone else of course, but Jeff does a good job of keeping things sane.  Other mobile fun: The K-Link and KanOkla repeater networks, APRS, ragchews with friends either via repeater or simplex, talking on simplex while on road trips.  Listening in on the weather nets.  So, who do I talk to? Anyone willing to talk to me.  As for features, I've had two mobiles with cross band repeat.  Neat in theory, great when you need it, but in 14 years, I've never once needed it.  I can see use cases for it, but they're in the realm of things like disaster response, search & rescue, that sort of things, where you need to be able to set up a mini-repeater on the fly."

amateurradio,3d8ooa,jasmuz,3,Tue Jul 14 15:48:39 2015 UTC,"I just finished my mobile installation, although I dumped a bunch of money into it. I drive a Dodge Ram 1500, and removed the centre console / seat and installed a Ram-Mount console box in which I installed my CB (Uniden Bearcat 980) and a bunch of switches. On the top of the console sits the control head of an ICOM IC-7100, with the main unit hidden underneath.  The ram-mount box accepts adjustable arms, and I have one of these installed holding an Android smartphone running RepeaterBook. This connects via Bluetooth to a BlueCAT interface connected to the radio, so I can select from a list of the nearest repeaters on the phone and configure the radio with a single touch. I also have a Garmin GPS-18 LVC connected to the data port of the radio to supply GPS information.  The truck has a canopy on it, on which is mounted a Yakima MegaWarrior cargo basket. I have my spare tire up there, and Yakima sells these accessory brackets for mounting off-road lights, but I am using these as antenna bases, running a Wilson trucker 5000 for the CB and a Diamond SG7900A for the ham VHF / UHF.  The only thing I haven't done yet is install a HF antenna and antenna tuner, but I'm going to play with it for a while before spending more money.  Anyway, I got it originally as a comms option for greater range and less idiocy than CB (which I only have because it's a requirement of the local off-road club), so I run simplex when travelling with friends, or monitor the local repeaters when in town."

You'd either need multiple antennas or some kind of sophisticated switching scheme to use one antenna... But multiple antennas might be a better option for efficiency on different bands...   When I really think about it, I think these issues might be why they don't build the radios with more than two radios... The compromises get complex. Now, a single or dual band radio to connect to an android device could be interesting..."

amateurradio,3d72b0,billybobwillyt,0,Tue Jul 14 03:14:26 2015 UTC,"Yup.  That's absolutely correct.  But remember, you've got to track the person back through TOR first to the WiFi hot spot.   Then you need so send someone out to the WiFi hot spot to find the user -- and in most cases you are going to expect to find someone sitting in the cafe.  It's going to take some time to realize that, and bring in a team to locate the remote link.  Now, an intelligent person will only keep this link active long enough to make a transmission which could be anywhere from a few minutes down to a few seconds.  At that point it is going to be very, very difficult to make a trace back to a person."

I could have connected to tor, done something I didn't want traced to me, and been gone hours before someone showed up to investigate. Other than the increased search area, I don't know what this would buy you.  Edit to say that I'm not trying to be a pain in the rear.. I really think I must be missing something.

amateurradio,3d89f1,lodc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:08:10 2015 UTC,"Well, club members already have RPi and we've already taken receipt of extra Pis and PiTNCs.  You race with what you brought to the track.  Honestly, if I had said to the club ""let's buy tinytraks,"" then I'd have nobody doing the project, anyway, because there'd be limited appeal.  At least 2 of the 4 people doing this with me are doing it because ""let's play with an RPi"" was part of the project.  As someone mentions below, there's likely a way to just script the launch of Xasitr in an X virtual framebuffer, which is probably just fine.  Given that putting the thing together an proving it out only took an hour or so last night, that's not so bad at all.  There are guides for RPi APRS; they just rely on Dire Wolf."

The primary goal here was to make APRS trackers...so, something that beacons.  But the other goal was to get club members excited in a hacking project that ends up also making a good platform for further VHF/UHF digital experimentation."

It's also not reusable for other projects, and since ""let's do something fun with a Pi"" is the leading reason half the members elected to do the project, that's just meant engagement, which is pretty important to me.  In either case, it's the hardware we now have, so it's worth finishing out the project as-is and finding new ways to expand once we're done.  I reckon few of us will end up keeping the thing purely an APRS tracker for all that long.  It's just odd to not find more headless options out there in Linux-land is all.

amateurradio,3d74f0,NewOldStockCard,3,Tue Jul 14 02:42:46 2015 UTC,"I use a lot of APRS on long motorcycle rides. It is fun for me because it automatically generates a map of my rides. APRS saves your data for about 2 years according to APRS.fi. It is fun to go back and have a log of my rides. It also let's friends and family follow along witch is fun for them.  I use Yeasu FT1D 5W HT for APRS including sending messages over the APRS system. I picked it up for $309 at HRO. It works well for local and around town rides but 5W won't make the digipeater out in the middle of nowhere.  If I am going on a real long ride I use aprsdriod on my Verizon smartphone. You can use a TNC with it but on long rides I choose to use my cellphones data instead. The drawback is I use mobile data instead of radio waves so you might consider it cheating. But, I still have all features of the APRS network and as long as I have cellphone coverage I know I will be reporting to the APRS network. No more stress over having enough watts to make it to the digipeater.   Aprsdriod is a $4 download on the marketplace or it can be downloaded for free off of the developer's website! That's right, as soon as you get get your call sign you can start using APRS for free on your smartphone!  That is how and why I use APRS. I just enjoy using the system and I like having the my rides automatically mapped for me. Congratulations on passing your test! You may not fully realize it yet, but will soon find out it is a entirely new world.  73!"
amateurradio,3d74f0,charliemic5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"I've been doing something similar (not APRS of course) with my iPhone and occasionally an inReach. The use case for me, is that I end up spending a couple of days in areas with little to no cell phone coverage. The inreach is ok...but service is expensive and I don't trust the messaging app to work because the last time I tried to use it, it didn't actually send the message for 2 days. It was a low priority, but it never gave me any indication that it hadn't sent, so I worry about it's ability to actually get me in contact with help if I really need it. I think APRS would be more reliable (and cheaper, if I'm already going to buy a radio anyway)."
amateurradio,3d74f0,kb5prz,3,Tue Jul 14 22:44:20 2015 UTC,"http://www.byonics.com/mt-rtg  I use this device to record tracks while driving or motorcycling.  I would recommend against solutions which incorporate smart phones--more setup, more complexity for power sourcing, etc., though some folks have those solutions figured out and have great success.  The Byonics devices are nice because they are purpose built for APRS--no need to dual purpose any other equipment.  Their function is largely transparent and you can focus on other things (operating voice while driving).  A separate antenna and transmitter means no concerns of splitting functions in one radio."

I'm really not interested in choosing a side in the proprietary format war for my first radio.  My thinking was ""I want to do APRS stuff"" but the 710 is my upper price limit for a first radio that's not HF. If I can do APRS in a functional useful way without spending ~$700 on just the radio I'd rather do that, but I see the appeal in the 710 of being a complete unit (gps/TNC/2-band radio with a nice legible control head)."

Unless you are going to link a display (AVMap) to the 710, a lot of the functionality you have is lost on the limited display.   Programming the 710 is a PITA as well.  I've owned both, ran both mobile, and the 5100 is the way to go.  You can find a 5100 pre-owned pretty reasonably..."
