fatpeoplestories,3e29gx,WallyMcWalrus99,12,Tue Jul 21 12:03:51 2015 UTC,What makes this even more upsetting is the fact that the gluten free cake was awful  There are certain kinds of gluten free cakes that are goddamned amazing. Arguably better than normal cake. The best red velvet cake AND angel food cake I ever had were gluten free. Bitch needs to step her fake-celiac-having game up.
fatpeoplestories,3e29gx,Guenhwyvere,5,Tue Jul 21 16:21:48 2015 UTC,"Best red velvet cake I ever had was GF and vegan. Fucking outstanding cake, like if the cake was a person, you'd hang out with it."
fatpeoplestories,3e29gx,MrZev,6,Tue Jul 21 16:39:56 2015 UTC,"Fuck yeah. I definitely recommend trying out GF angel food, too (if you're into that kind of thing). I seriously can't tell the difference, which makes sense - angel food cake is leavened and supported by sugar and whipped egg whites (that's why you need to bake it in a special pan. With no gluten, the cake needs help to ""climb"" the sides of the pan. An angel food cake pan provides more surface area. More surface area = more climbing capacity). The flour included in it provides texture and caramelization, but the cake itself requires no gluten for its structure, like a meringue. Thus, you can use virtually any flour mix for it without degrading the flavor or texture."

I dated a guy in high school that was celiac, and I remember even finding information about flour substitution and such wasn't exactly easy. You had to do a fair amount of looking, and experimenting. These days there's more information that's easier to access, and more GF options than ever. Long gone are the days of weirdly textured and flavorless GF baked goods!"

I've been taken to some fairly nice restaurants.

In July 2012 I was slide tackled by a teammate during practice, it was a dirty tackle. She tore the labrum in my hip.  I went to a doctor and he went in and did a labrectomy and osteoplasty. I didn't know at the time that labrectomys are a no no now a days. I was still having a lot of pain. So I got another MRI and it was decided that I needed more surgery because the labrum was still torn and there was some other odd things showing up.  Second surgery: I had a second labrectomy done, a psoas release, more osteoplasty, calcification fragment removal (the bones calcified from the first osteoplasty that I had and then chipped off within the joint) as well as scar tissue removal.  Still was having a lot of pain, even more so than before the surgery. My doctor told me I was imagining it. Went to a different doctor and he immeadietly reffered me to a doctor in Colorado.  Turns out my hip has basically been destroyed by the injury and the surgeries. So this last surgery they went in, removed just over 7cm of my IT band and then reattached it in my joint as a labrum (I was missing 70% of my labrum), the osteoplasty wasn't done well the first two times so it didn't heal smooth so they did more osteoplasty. They also performed microfracture which is where they drill a bunch of tiny holes into the bone. The ball of the femur was also more oval than round so they shaved that until it was round. They also physically restructed the socket of the hipjoint. Finally, my bursa sack had been destroyed by the previous doctor and so they got a donor one and grafted that in there.  I'm happy to say this is the first time I have been pain free in several years."

What you're reading could be the 'daytime population', which basically included all the people who travel into Osaka during working hours, but don't actually live there.

fatpeoplestories,3dxwro,Lowawesome411,5,Mon Jul 20 17:43:50 2015 UTC,NZ has a higher percentage of Asian's than America so it would be understandable for an American Weeaboo to go a long time without meeting a Japanese person.  Also it is not uncommon for a Japanese restaurant in NZ to have more Japanese menus than English ones and to have servers who will give you the dirtiest look ever if you order in English. From what I'm told that is pretty unheard of in America. Weeblyn has had opportunities to eat Japanese food other than Sushi. Honestly given where we live if she hung around the right areas she would probably pick up some better Japanese than what she knows now.
fatpeoplestories,3dxwro,Treascair,4,Mon Jul 20 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the clarification. Also, depending on where you are in the states that can happen too.

She missed at least 1 day a week for the entire time she worked there. (We were allowed 4 every 4 weeks on a floating scale)  I was in the room when she finally got fired. She had skipped on a holiday which was double penalty. There was a reason they fired her in a room with nothing on the desks to throw. The complaints about discrimination, how her modeling and acting career was so much more lucrative, and how it was a privilege for the company to have her as an employee, etc... I was actively laughing as she stormed out the door.  We actually had a mini party the next morning. She was a drama filled ball of hate."

fatpeoplestories,3dqm5h,Bunny_ofDeath,32,Sat Jul 18 16:33:14 2015 UTC,I found that as I was transitioning from teen to women's sizes that maternity tops fit me perfectly.   I was a 17 pant size that was only found in teens/juniors and my shirts needed to be a women's large or so. (Boobs exploded at 10 overnight into c and then d cups)    I was no more than 13 years old when I needed to start finding clothes in the women's section. Nothing in women's really fit me well and it was all old people style. Maternity fit great with lots of extra room in the front and they had cool and hip styles.  I did get lots of looks as a teen shopping in maternity but fuck the judgey people. I did what worked. I wish my mom had given me better eating habits. My grandmother really is to blame since it started with her raising me.   Ive only just recently got my portion sizes in order and I don't eat like I used to. Sucks to be forced into those sizes when you are young and don't know better.   As an adult I really didn't know anything about nutrition and mostly was given haes by everyone except my doctor.   Just now losing weight after the birth of my son by exercising and limiting caloric intake. It's so easy to do. I always just assumed genetics and thyroid.

fatpeoplestories,3dqm5h,internetwife,13,Sat Jul 18 16:28:16 2015 UTC,"I have to say that it isn't just larger people that maternity tops fit well. I've always been fairly small. Right now I'm 5 feet tall and 125. But my breasts are really big for my frame so regular tops either squish everything flat and weird or, if my boobs fit in fine, it hangs off the boob shelf and looks like I'm wearing my dad's clothes. I have the same problem with a lot of dresses- buy for boob room and I end up with enough body room to smuggle watermelons. Maternity tops work great. Lately, you can find really cute tops that have room for large boobs but are usually made of a stretchy material so they still fit better around my middle. I've bought several when I've found nice tops (like dress tops that look good with slacks or skirts). I don't care at all. My sister is built about the same and also finds tops that work better in the maternity section."

fatpeoplestories,3dn2jp,isaviolinist,3,Fri Jul 17 17:07:04 2015 UTC,"Claiming something is an ""excuse"" is stupid. An excuse is something like, ""oh, well the cat's sitting on my textbook so I shouldn't bother to study"" or something realistic like ""Well, all my mom ever buys is junk food, so I shouldn't make an attempt to educate her about nutrition or pick out food myself.""  You gained weight because of stress and daily life. Not an excuse. It's an explanation for why you became that way. The excuse would be, ""well, i'm already fat. Might as well get fatter/do nothing."" You can't think of this all as excuses/justifications/whatever. They are explanations. The good thing is you have realized your mistakes and improved yourself."

I thought aesthetics were a huge deal in South Korea  (I'm assuming you mean South Korea)  Maybe it's the kpop and the Korean tv shows they played at the place I used to buy bubble tea in college, but that was just the impression I got. I can't really imagine a little fat kid porking out on two ice creams like it's  the Midwest America."

I'd imagine obese children like hamchild would be teased quite a lot in school, though.  I don't think hating fat is as extreme as westerners think, but it does exist to an extent. But still, fat kids have friends and whatnot. I think it's more our parents' generation who do the little passive aggressive thing with saying ""Oh, you've gotten fatter, dear!"" etc.   Also, as /u/llamalily said, most plastic surgery is just double eyelid surgery, then probably things like jaw fillers, nose fillers.

fatpeoplestories,3dkfzj,jupfold,20,Fri Jul 17 01:54:23 2015 UTC,I KNOW. I can barely manage half an entree from there-- when I worked there I usually stuck to their soups and salads and breadsticks. Occasionally the chicken fingers... but that's besides the point!  I've seen some pretty nasty eating at the OG. She's probably second place for ate the most food. I had someone ask for two helpings of the tour of italy once...on the same plate. He ate everything. It was disgusting.

We get out to a lot of kink events and there's always (WHY is kink such a ham-magnet?) several large women crammed into corsets.  The thing is... Corsets aren't magic. All of those curves have to go somewhere. Where do they go? Out the top, spilling into their armpits until their shoulders aren't aligned correctly, and up to their chin, threatening to smother them if they try to look down. The rest pours out of the bottom of the corset, creating an innertube that they have to grease in order to squeeze their leather skirt over to contain the chaos.   I don't know how they do it. I was fitted into a 20 once, being overconfident with our local corset maker. These corsets are the real deal- double steel boning, they'll break your ribs.

My boobs are not at all what they were 20 or even 15 years ago so trying to wear a regular corset just doesn't look right to me. But they will stuff themselves into anything.

I also had hip surgery, and a woman came up to me screaming at me in a parking lot once about me not looking disabled. Now, this was literally my first trip out alone post-surgery, and what she didn't see was me hobble on crutches to get a cart, then hobble back to my car to put the crutches in, since I was leaning on the cart instead, and she just came up and started yelling at me, and accused me of stealing my grandma's (???) Handicap Tag.   Well, I made this woman feel like shit. I pointed to the tag, and to my crutches, and told me not everyone has a visible disability, and frankly, it wasn't her damn business. I asked her how proud she was of verbally assaulting someone for no reason, and how things looked from up their on her high horse, and I basically just made her feel like an asshole. She apologized, and told me that she thinks healthy people steal handicap spots all the time, and I told her that she should call the police instead of harassing someone in a parking lot - you can get a hang tag for all sorts of issues like heart problems, invisible illnesses, etc. and it wasn't her job or place to go around making people feel bad for not being ""sick enough"". I actually think she left the store because she went back to her car after she apologized, and I never saw her in there.   Honestly, people suck. And frankly if I were you, I'd call that office and talk to management because no one should be made to feel bad about their REAL illness or disability."

Ketogenic diet means dropping your carbs down to 20 - 50g and replacing it with fat. Your body changes from burning glycogen for energy to burning fat for energy, which means if you keep calories to a deficit your body burns your fat stores.  I have never been able to lose weight, and I've tried all the low fat, count calories, spend hours at the gym diets. This month I lost 5kg from eating ""low carb/high fat"" ketogenic diet. I eat bacon, steaks, creamy sauces, cheese, cream, eggs, butter and dark green veggies. I lose weight and I'm not hungry. Keto is excellent."

If you're still losing for the time being it might be okay to have something slightly ill fitting but when you reach your target goal get a proper measurement and fitting done and pickup a few pieces that you like. You'll feel a lot sexier and give yourself a confidence boost especially if you have low self esteem.

I had to try on every single 36C in the store [18 of them] before I found one that was like a 95% fit, which is the one I ended up getting.

I had decided to give myself a splurge day to feed my beetus and low blood sugah and satisfy muh condishuns. Tomorrow I will return to my shitlordful ways.  My very, extremely, unimportant NSV during today is that I actually follow my faith's recommendation and stop before I actually feel full. I eat lots of curried chicken and meat with only little rice, and when I feel I could cram in a bit more, I said to myself, ""Nah, later on I could munch on some nice sweetmeats."" So I didn't, and I didn't touch any food for an hour. I didn't feel shitty and sad for overeating, in fact my tummy feels OK. Huzzah for the Fathead documentary! I do end up with quite some sweetmeats, but I eat those sparingly and fill my time with asking my grandpa about his police days.  Of course, this splurge isn't a very good practice at all, thus I will not continue celebrating in this manner for the rest of the lunar month. Malaysians are keen to continue celebrating for that long, since they toiled in tiredness during the Ramadan. I could not do the encouraged six days of fasting after Ramadan though, I feel too weak to do that. Maybe next year."

Been dealing with various health issues and decided to stop crappy eating -- fruit instead of candy, lower cal/smaller snacks (like if I want cheetos I get one of the little bags, it's a portion all in one), and so on.   I went to my internist a week ago, had no idea how I was doing weight-wise but had just been able to start walking more  after not for a while. My weight is DOWN, AND MY A1C is down to 5.1. I am still processing this 0-0- my doc called and said, 'your A1C is great, you need to stop taking this pill"". I didn't process what he was saying and said, 'so I should start taking the metformin again?' and he said, 'no, stop taking all the meds and still monitor your sugars once a day, you seem to be on the right track.'   It is the first positive health thing in a while, so it is encouraging."
fatpeoplestories,3dkszv,Kohsmos,3,Fri Jul 17 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"Until a few months ago, I would only think about food.   I'd eat breakfast and then think about what I'd eat for lunch (take out food). After I was done with lunch, I'd think about snacks. You catch the drift?   I wasted a lot of time thinking about food, getting the food, eating it, loathing that I ate a lot of calories, feeling regret, hating my protruding tummy, et al.  Things are different now.   I do productive stuff and not think about food unless it is lunch or dinner time. I have easy recipes handy and cook food when I'm hungry. Ofcourse I haven't completely stopped eating restaurant food.   I've lost a lot of fat and feel pretty good about myself.   I don't need food to feel happy. [exceptions included :P ]"

I must have walked 4 miles of the 10.5, but I made it.  Did 5 mile training run a couple of nights ago even though it was hot and muggy and I really didn't feel up to it. My time sucked royally, but at least I went. Another training run yesterday went like crap, but it's not going to stop me.  Hopefully it will be cooler the day of the race.  On a vanity note, my size 4s now fit like my size 10s did about 8 months ago. I'd like to keep it that way."

Also get a set schedule whether it's before work or during a noon lunch break or after.  BTW I think going to the gym just for cardio is kind of bullshit, you should get your moneys worth by using the equipment that would otherwise be too expensive to purchase by yourself. You can do cardio outside in the fresh air (even in the winter if you so desire). Why go spinning when you can ride a bike for real? why run on a treadmill when you can run on the street and see the sights? That said, at my house my treadmill only gets used like 3 months of the year when it's too cold to go outside and run. If you ever desire to purchase a treadmill though, the best time to buy used is around February or March, I got a $3000 machine with a lot of bells and whistles for like $1500."
fatpeoplestories,3dkszv,lindseywitt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"The problem with outdoor cardio is that I'm in Texas.  So from May to October, outdoor cardio is suicide unless you're super in shape.  I think I might start doing 20 or 30 minutes of light cardio in the gym after lifting, just so I get it all done.  Besides.  The gym has rowing machines :3  I am in love with rowing machines now."

The disorder is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and it presents (in me) mainly as chronic joint pain and bursitis in my elbows, shoulders and especially my knees.  It also can cause somewhat severe bouts of heart palpitations.  Oh, and it also makes me almost entirely immune to pain and anti-inflammatory medications.  Yesterday, instead of making a snack to feel better about myself I worked out for the first time since high school.  Instead of letting the all-too-common ""genetics"" and ""condishuns"" excuses get in the way, I worked out until I dripped sweat.  It hurt, a lot actually, but it feels very good now.  Guys, I miss long distance running.

I assume you're not in America, or I'd tell you to try to get one at Target, because I bought mine there for fifteen dollars. I've had it six months and it's still blending strong! I've saved so much blending my own smoothies and coffee that it sort of paid for itself!  I was getting coffee drinks laden with unnecessary calories at 22.50 a week, and now I pay around ten bucks for two weeks of soy milk and chocolate protein powder (and instant coffee, because I cannot live without it some days). I have saved over four hundred dollars in six months by making my own drinks, not to mention all of the calories I've not been eating in that time.  Jesus Christ I sound like a commercial, but I really do love my Oster this much. I'm drinking a breakfast smoothie right now. It took two minutes to blend, including taking it off and shaking it to make sure my berries and ice were getting mixed up properly."

I had never in my life made any effort to be physically active or anything, no sports or anything (my parents bought me a Wii and I would bowl or play tennis sitting down because I'm so extremely lazy).   Honestly it doesn't really seem like I would eat ""that much"" since I wasn't out at McBeetus buying and downing 4 cheeseburgers for every meal, it was mostly my lack of actual protein so I was never full and my snacking was out of control as a result- the list below is a description of my typical day:  Breakfast: Medium Mocha Frappe with extra chocolate drizzle and a bagel or a donut  Snack: Bag of chips  Lunch: Pasta of some sort loaded with Parmesan cheese with a salad (cus I thought it was healthy despite using iceberg lettuce, a handful of shredded cheese and lots of whole fat ranch dressing)  Snack: Bag of chips and some cookies  Dinner: Garlic bread and a whole box of Kraft Mac and cheese (made with whole milk, half a stick of butter, 2 slices of American cheese, extra cheese powder I bought from Winco, and garlic salt)  Dessert: Piece of cake or a half dozen cookies (about 2 times a week washed down with some kind of fruity alcoholic beverage)  Note: To my credit, I never drink soda."

fatpeoplestories,3diczm,Muntjac,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:40 2015 UTC,"Most of my food labels have this at the bottom:  Daily values based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Your values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs.  Even the government statements will say 2,000 is for an average person. So find out your country's average- height, weight, activity level- and then point out the differences between her and the average person. I'm shorter, lighter and much less active  (because I don't count things like vacuuming or checking the mail as exercise like some people do, lol) so I don't even have to look it up to know my needs are well under 2000. As far as I know it's never been made a standard, just a kind of midpoint that people could work off of."

fatpeoplestories,3dga5x,icepudding,3,Thu Jul 16 09:48:23 2015 UTC,All I got out of this story was wanting FroYo.  Are fat people stories supposed to make you fat?

fatpeoplestories,3dga5x,BeetusBot,2,Sat Jul 18 17:42:43 2015 UTC,"Do they charge you for toppings? The froyo places over here charge by weight, the more toppings you pile on the more they charge. And gummies are actually quite heavy...learnt that the hard way."
fatpeoplestories,3dga5x,Treascair,6,Thu Jul 16 08:05:40 2015 UTC,"It's the weight of the toppings and yogurt combined. Like, you get your yogurt, put the toppings on and then get charged for the total weight of the thing, regardless of the yogurt:toppings ratio."
