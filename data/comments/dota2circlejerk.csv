You tell your team that you will split push. You do this in a nice way because you are Lycan picker and you want to win. You buy stout, quelling, tangoes in that exact order. You go jungle. You get: level 7, 4-0-2-1 skill build. You have: vlads, quelling, stout, smoke. You smoke and take rosh before 10 minutes. You time that motherfucker. You buy brown boots. You go push a lane or take ancients if there is no safe lane to push. You repeat until game is won. You never fight with your team ever. You never fight without your team ever. Wolves need no armour. Why do wolves need no armour you may ask? Wolves need no armour because wolves never fight; wolves split push. This is why wolves need no armour. Your team dying 4 mid? You do not fight with them. You do not teleport to them. You do not flame them. You are Lycan and you want to win. You have teleportation scrolls but you use them to get to lanes as far away from danger as possible and push. You tell your team to fight under tower. You tell your team not to come to your lane. You do this in a nice way because even though wolves need no armour wolves want to win games. If you are getting ganked (you should be looking at the mini map and not be in a situation where you’re getting ganked) but if you are getting ganked you know what to do: you listen to Lycan and Lycan tells you what? That’s right you sonofabitch: Lycan tells you that ""the wolf runs"". You pop that ultimate, you back off and you TP out. You push another lane or you farm jungle/farm ancients/smoke roshan. If you don't know what to do then what do you do? That's right; you listen to Lycan again and Lycan tells you that ""the wolf runs"" and that ""wolves need no armour"". This does not mean ""the wolf fights""; it means that the wolf go split push. You are on a lane preferably furthest away from danger. You are in the jungle or at the ancients farming. You are at roshan getting that aegis timing that shit. You get necro 1, 2, 3. You upgrade your brown boots into boots of travel. You do it in this exact order. You keep that split push going. You smoke rosh whenever he's up. You keep telling your team not to be with you or come to your lanes. You are Lycan. You are nice about it. You are split push. You are objectives. You are win. You remember that ""wolves love to battle"" against structures because then wolves will need no armour and wolves can run in circles around the structures. You never fight. You end the game with 0-0-0 and the highest building damage ever conceived by man."

As part of compLexity, ppd finished second at both DreamHoN Winter 2012 and DreamHoN Summer 2013 before deciding to transition to Dota 2.  Playing on StayFree with zai, ppd was invited to play with ComeWithMe and sneyking on Super Strong Dinosaurs after TI3. While there ppd helped lead Super Strong Dinosaurs to a 2nd place finish at Bigpoint Battle #8 against none other than EG. A few short months later, ppd would be the new Captain of EG.  ppd's impact was immediate; with ppd taking over drafting and shot-calling duties, Fear returned to his comfort zone as NA's most devastating carry. But more importantly, ppd quickly established himself as a true support star in a region with historically weak support play. With ppd and zai forming a support backbone like no NA team had ever had before, EG's talented cores could finally flourish and EG had a meteoric rise into the elite ranks of professional Dota 2.  Now hailed as one of the best drafters in the game, ppd has led EG to the top of the Western DotA. Under his steady hand, EG's accomplishments include first place at the Summit, second at ESL Frankfurt, third at TI4, first at WEC 2014, second at ESL New York, first at StarLadder Season X, first at DreamHack Winter 2014, and first at DAC 2015.  With the Radiance in EG's grasp, ppd leads EG onward to the next International in pursuit of a shield to accompany its sword."

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you better stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realised exactly what was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My Mother said to me- ""Don't smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed and at 21 I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this post gave me cancer anyway."

The mango is a juicy stone fruit belonging to the genus Mangifera, consisting of numerous tropical fruiting trees, cultivated mostly for edible fruit. The majority of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes. They all belong to the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae. The mango is native to South and Southeast Asia, from where it has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics. The center of diversity of the Mangifera genus is in India.

dota2circlejerk,3bnn5f,MrTheodore,8,Tue Jun 30 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I believe Dota's gameplay serves not only as the means of competition, but also as the platform upon which we learn and delve into the beautiful worlds behind the individual heroes.  The gameplay mechanics and the spells that the heroes use in their battles serve to give us small glimpses into their personality traits, as do their dialogue lines when passing by either friends or foes.  Akasha, the Queen of Pain, is a perfect example of this.  By analyzing her spoken dialogue and spell descriptions we can conclude that she is a hot slut with big ol' titties who likes to shake them.  Based on this analysis, I will be personally voting for her in the upcoming election."

dota2circlejerk,3bl677,dopeboymagic23,3,Tue Jun 30 10:54:42 2015 UTC,"Hey retard, I'm the famous 11.5k player named aim fire cog.  Lemme tell your autistic ass how you dominate the game outside of mid, pick clockwerk, yea dud, fucking clockwerk, just do it. Put a point in stats for extra survivability, open battery assault lvl 2 and go for the triple kill, since everyone who plays this gaem is mentally challenged it's ez, you're now lvl 5, if you farmed the lane and jungle correctly it's 5 minutes in and you already have blademail and aghs, and maybe some 2k to spare, considering you stole last hits from other lanes with rocket.  Your goal is to have 300 cs in 8 minutes, and dominate the game from there, later retard, maybe one day u can be as good as me or sheever."
