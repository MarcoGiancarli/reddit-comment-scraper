I'd disagree about your point that feminism is obsolete in the U.S just as I'd disagree with someone saying there shouldn't be a men's rights movement, both sexes undoubtedly experience some form of sexism, whether it be over sexualisation of women or women being favoured over men in deciding child custody."
Equality,3e1vnu,theephors,2,Tue Jul 21 12:26:33 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing, Feminism claims to be about equality, why should men have to have their own movement if Feminism has it covered?"
Equality,3e1vnu,searchingfortao,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:25 2015 UTC,"Feminism does ""have it covered"" as you say.  There are loons in every camp, but on the whole, feminists advocate for equal rights, including those championed by men's rights types.  These issues include:   Paternity leave Treating men as equal partners in child rearing   This extends to things like child custody bias  Dispelling social biases that insist that:   Women are natural care givers Men are naturally violent Men are incapable of emotions other than anger Women are weak and irrational    etc. etc.  Honestly, when you look into what feminism stands for: eradicating a broken paradigm (patriarchy) that hurts everyone, you realise that opponents of it tend to oppose it for any of three reasons:   They don't know what feminism is, or are letting a few crazy man-haters represent the position. They have a problem with the word ""feminism"" and would prefer a less gendered term.  I refer these people to words like ""mankind"" and politely suggest some perspective. They actually hate women   So in closing I want to say that men don't need their own label, because ""feminist"" applies, and don't let anyone tell you that men don't share common cause with other feminists.  We're all victims of the same system and most of us are working to get out."
Equality,3e1vnu,elmental17,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:27:12 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing, as I said below in another comment;   Ultimately what we want is the same; equality. We just believe in different things that would bring it to fruition. I see the Feminist group as a group who claims to know the way to true freedom and equality, but everything about their organization just seems.. off. Just take the name for example, Feminism. That can be taken so many different ways, where if it were called ""Equalism"", there's only one way to perceive it. For example, some people believe that Feminism is the rise of Women to dominate, forcing men to be second class citizens just as women were, a sort of revenge. Some people believe that Feminism is about turning males to be more like women, as they believe that that is the only way society can work. These are actual things people believe. Hell, anyone who's ever set foot on tumblr knows, real people believe that death to all men is the only way a truly good society can flourish.  This ideology needs to stop, feminism needs to stop. In order to promote a truly equal society, we can't run under some name that promotes one side of the partnership, we need to run under Equalism, otherwise the only ones who will benefit from this global equality realization will be women.   Pretty much for me it's both number one and number two. All I see when I think of Feminists are a group of men-hating women who want to tip the balance into their favor, punishing men for all the years women were treated as second class citizens. People I talk to always claim that the Feminists who hate men are a ""Vocal Minority"", but you have to see that that's all the world sees. Every media post about Feminists are about those Feminists, and it's ruining the true goal. Instead of allowing those ""Feminists"" to control the media, you have to take them and push them out of the driver seat, otherwise they're going to crash the car. Hell, even some of my friends who started off as reasonable Feminists when we started discussing it turned into the men-hating person as we talked. Let me pull up a conversation.   Her: ""NAME ONE F***ING COUNTRY WHERE MEN ARE TREATED LESSER THAN WOMEN -- NAME ONE""  Me: ""Is that what you want? For men to be treated less than women? That's not f***ing equality.""   She then insulted men saying   ""It's like, you think we don't know how f***ing stupid men are?""  Me: ""There it is. Not once did I insult a feminist.""  Her: ""Okay but men are legitimately stupid. You're the sole reason behind this nation, scratch that, world, being in such a terrible state.""  Me: ""There we go.""  Her: ""MEN HAVE OPPRESSED US FOR SO LONG. you: you can't call hitler stupid because you're a Jew like, he has feelings too""  Me: ""Men are hitler?""  Her: ""Yes exactly. You act above us. You oppress us.""  Me: ""There's the all-men-must-die feminist. You just said that not all feminists are like that, but in the span of 10 mins you turned into one""   And I used to date this girl too. I don't know, but the Feminist teachings of those who are the ""vocal minority"" are actually turning women against men and it's going to end badly."

Here is a prominent feminist, lauded by pretty much every reasonable media outlet as a bridge builder and advocate for equality.  The stories weren't about ""how refreshing it is to hear such a positive view on feminism"" but rather how brave she was, in the face of the well documented hate for women in our society.  And you have to get over the name.  Feminism started as a means to liberate women.  As it grew though, it became obvious that all sexes are oppressed by the same force.  If you seriously have a problem with the name, then this is not a serious conversation.  I again refer you to ""mankind"" and other uses of ""man"" as the ""default human""."

Lol I don't even have a Tumblr account. Seriously though, go to google and type in ""feminist"" and go to the news tab. This is the kind of stuff I found immediately, a story about a guy who has children with a woman talking about how they have an ""open marriage"" (though he never states that he's ever cheated on her), basically admitting to be a cuckold after his ""feminist"" wife told him it was fine.  And listen, I didn't come up with the name ""mankind"", and quite honestly, that needs to change too. Genders need to quit fighting and realize that we're all people. Change the name of mankind, I won't have a fit, only people who might are scientists. We need to come together under a common name in which we all can agree upon.

Equality,3e1vnu,noaz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"Oh I see the problem, it's not selection bias, it's personal bias.  There's nothing wrong with that article.  In fact, I'd say that it's a wonderfully progressive view on female sexuality and the needs of individuals within a marriage.  Where you see a poor guy being cuckholded by his wife, I see a couple who's accepted that both sides have needs and wants outside of their marriage partner.  The whole article in fact is about the man's journey toward this understanding.  This, coupled by the fact that it does explicitly mention that he steps out on his wife (albeit less often than she does the same) tells me that you skimmed the article at best and applied your own bias rather than listening to what what was said.  So it sounds to me like you need to take some time and really consider your own prejudices here.  For me, it was starting with the possibility that feminism wasn't misandry in disguise.  After that, I made the conscious choice to avoid Tumblr, Jezebel, and TheMarySue, all common echo chambers for man haters.  Finally, I'd suggest monitoring your own language, taking note of when and why you use ""he"" instead of ""she"", ""man"" instead of ""woman"" and vice versa.  You might even try using ""she"" instead of the default ""he"" whenever you're talking about someone for which the gender is irrelevant.  It's jarring at first, but as a thought exercise, it can be revealing.  In time, if you make an honest effort of it, you'll come to recognise your own biases and (hopefully) correct for it.  And maybe one day,  a magazine story about a man who loves his wife for who she is won't feel so threatening."

Equality,3d3mwf,nonsensepoem,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:59:45 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you on about? The intermarriage rate for Jews is exceptionally high - more than 70% of married American Jews who don't identify as Orthodox are married to non-Jews. When you separate out the Orthodox, numbers are comparable around the world, Israel excluded. The issue, of course, is what percentage of the Jewish community is Orthodox. In the US, for example, only around 10% of Jews are Orthodox. I've never seen a reliable breakdown for Mexican Jews, but my understanding is that very nearly all Mexican Jews (probably more than 90%) are Orthodox. Nowhere in the world do Orthodox Jews accept intermarriage, since it is an absolute violation of Halachah (Jewish law). So the effect you see in Mexico is not particular to Mexico, but to Orthodox communities, who happen to dominate in Mexico.  As an aside, it's worth pointing out that the children produced from these intermarriages are either not Jewish (if the father is the only Jew) or are otherwise being raised in an unsuitable household without a proper Jewish identity (if only the mother is Jewish), such that at least exclusion of their progeny from parochial school makes sense. And if indeed the progeny aren't Jewish, why would they be entitled to the in-group selection benefits of a Jewish identity (as all in-groups have for their members)?"

Equality,3bta34,aaantoqj,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"Do you feel women have more beneficial advantages over men?   I think it's impossible to quantify like that, because everyone places different weightings on each situation depending on their personal circumstances. For example, I know gay men who don't care about paternity rights because they don't see it ever affecting them directly. So everyone will quantify it differently. I don't think it should matter who has it 'worse', we should use our resources to help anyone who needs it. Sometimes it sucks to belong to one group and you wish you could choose. Other times you count your stars that you don't have to deal with shit the other group gets.   I like how you described that there are the two different types: circumstantial and institutional.   Not sure if they're the correct terms academically - i've long since lost faith in sociology as a legimitimate field of science. But to me they are completely different. If a women who is the best mechanic in town can't get work because her potential employer doesn't think women can be capable of mechanical work, then absolutely she is being discriminated against. But it's not men as a group nor society as a force that is enforcing the disadvantage; it's the actions and biases of one person and not representative of society as a whole.  Compare that to a situation where a laws exist that prevent women from working as mechanics or fail to punish those who unfairly discriminate during the hiring of female mechanics. In this case, it is society-wide and enforced by society.   The first case still happens, but it is against the law and the individual has the right to seek justice against those individual(s). The second type is condoned by society, and individuals are powerless to do anything about it.  Getting back to the video, all the examples given belong in the first catagory; any women who experiences those things will have support from the majority of people and has the right to get compensation or have the government intervene and rectify. I can't think of a single women's issue that better fits the second catagory and not this first. Can you?  This is in stark contrast to most men's issues, which exist in the second catagory. Hence why I think women definitely have the legal advantage in western nations, and also why I think it is impossible to describe western nations as 'patriarchal' without doing an awful amount of cherry-picking and question-begging."

Where's men tend to be stronger and more likely to protect the family. When war arrises I think people go back to their instincts. Equality talks more about societies that are more advanced where a man can care for a child and a woman can be strong. So they want that view to change.

Equality,3a8znn,UNMzoet75,25,Thu Jun 18 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"Here is the difference.  The real answer is because gender is not entirely a social construct despite what some college sociology majors might think.  Race, however, is.  Society throughout history has defined what it means to be a certain race.  If you take away the stereotypes, assumptions, traditions, etc that society has defined for being ""black"" you have nothing else left for racial identity save the color of your skin.  That is about as significant as eye color or foot size in shaping your identity (in other words, not important at all in the absence of society).  Black and White people are not mentally wired in significantly different ways.  The differences in behaviors between races are entirely a result of the society one lives in, including that society's definition of race.  Identifying with the black experience is a learned behavior, not something you are born with.  There is nothing wrong with that, but you cannot be a black person born in a white person's body.  Gender on the other hand is not entirely defined by society.  If you take away all those things society has placed on being a certain gender, you still have core biological and mental differences.  For example, females (of pretty much any species) are biologically and mentally wired for nurturing and motherhood.  This is a fact that exists regardless of society.  People can be born biologically having physical parts of both genders or having ambiguous parts that are not 100% one way or the other.  It therefore makes sense that people could also be mentally wired in a way where their gender identity is less clear to them, or does not entirely match up with their physical gender.  Society plays a significant role in shaping one's gender identity, but there is an important biological component as well.  You can feel like a female but have a male body and vice versa without the influence of society.  You cannot say the same for race.  Let's address the hypothetical white person claiming to be black (although this works for any ""races"").  As for why it is not okay to be ""transrace"" regardless of the above, it is because you have learned everything about that race from society.  You are appropriating their experiences without having lived them.  There is a difference between saying you identify with black culture and saying you are black.  There is no possible way you could have lived the experiences of a black person in whatever society you are part of.  There is no possible way you could feel like a ""black person in a white person's body"" without having first learned society's stereotypes, assumptions, and traditions surrounding the black ""race"", since the definition of any race is shaped entirely by society.  Claiming to be ""transrace"" can be offensive to those who actually have lived those experiences, especially if their racial identity makes their lives difficult (for example, being more likely to be a victim of racial profiling and police brutality)."
Equality,3a8znn,tsumeone,10,Thu Jun 18 10:14:54 2015 UTC,"This was very nicely put, however I think the last paragraph is wrong.   There is no possible way you could have lived the experiences of a black person in whatever society you are part of.   If race is entirely a social construct, then it is certainly possible for a person to experience society's stereotypes, assumptions, and traditions without having the skin color associated with them.  Or say a white person is raised in a society where thy are discriminated against and held to the same stereotypes as black people in american society.  I would say that person has a much better understanding of what it means ""to be black"" than a person born into wealth and privilege who happens to have black skin."
Equality,3a8znn,SaulsAll,3,Thu Jun 18 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"That is entirely true, and some races in other parts of the world will have experiences that closely analogs the experience of blacks for example in the US.  It won't be 100% the same, but they will be able to identify with the black race better than say a suburban white woman from the US.  When I wrote that sentence, what I meant was they could not have lived all of the same experiences that comes with being identified as a member of a certain race in their part of the world.  They could be from a similar background, but it wouldn't be exactly the same.  That would make them likely to identify with the black experience, but they would not be able to ""feel"" black."
Equality,3a8znn,tsumeone,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:41:32 2015 UTC,"So if I were to expand upon what your saying and mix in some of what /u/SaulsAll has said...  A wealthy privileged black person from Nairobi who moved to Harlem at 35 shouldn't be able to claim being black because their internal experiences don't match the societal narrative?  Yet we all know no one would deny that person the right to call themselves ""black"" because we do identify it as a skin color primarily and a cultural / social thing secondary.  Society may create the definition, but the definition isn't society.  So lets say tomorrow we invented a procedure that gave permanent pigmentation adjustment.  So we have a Caucasian individual growing up in the less wealthy areas of Nairobi, their trials and tribulations for arguments sake we will say are on par with the folks out in Harlem.  Before moving to Harlem they opt for this procedure to match their external pigmentation to their internal viewpoint to bring it into alignment with the narrative of the society they're moving to.  Are they wrong to do this?  Why do they not qualify as ""Black"" while the wealthy Nairobian with nothing in common with the average Harlemite except natural skin pigmentation does?  If the wealthy Nairobian opted to lighten their skin tone before moving, if their internal description now matches the external description their new society expects... who are we to tell them ""you're wrong for changing your race""?  Be proud of being Black!  When the definition for being Black is vastly different between the starting culture of Nairobi and ending culture of Harlem isn't in alignment with how they see themselves?  As a transhumanist things like gender and physical distinction among races are so superficial that the fact so much of societies energies are spent on saying yes to this or no to that sometimes makes me wonder if we'll ever get off this rock.  What the hell will all these shallow people think when we turn ourselves into something non-human because we find it beautiful and for no other reason than that?

I suppose I was thinking closer to a wealthy, privileged black person in Nirobe.  Because I feel what people really mean by ""feeling black"" is the feeling that at every moment the society a person lives in reminds the person they don't fit in, and that there's no way to hide from this ""otherness.""  Again, I think a person who is white could have this very same feeling, but I agree it isn't going to happen in the current US."
Equality,3a8znn,SaulsAll,5,Thu Jun 18 17:38:55 2015 UTC,The real answer is because gender is not entirely a social construct despite what some college sociology majors might think.

The good students can figure out the difference w/o the professor specifying.  What makes a theory (eg. 'gender is a social construct') important is its contribution to ongoing discourse.

You can't leave out the possibility anymore. Once an idea exists, it doesn't go away. Even gender dysphoria(then transexualism) wasn't even a thing people knew existed until the mid 20th century. You can't leave out the possibilities of Transrace's existence. Honestly I believe that no college, companies, or government should recognize someone's race, sexuality, or gender. Certain companies should only recognize sex and only if what their service is has a safety issue or safety guidlines for a certain sex. Like if your a Woman Male, and you have a penis, why do we expect you to have a vagina and need tampons or other female products. That's honestly the only exception for situations such as that.

Equality,3a8znn,shaim2,22,Thu Jun 18 05:23:38 2015 UTC,"Race isn't biological.   Our best scientific knowledge indicates that you are born with an inherent gender identity. (Whether that's genetic, epigenetic, hormonal, or what, we don't know. But we know it's inherent.)   The same isn't true of racial or cultural identities. Take a baby born in, say, Nigeria, and raise him in London, and he's going to speak with a London accent, and enjoy food, entertainment, and other cultural trappings of London. He won't be Nigerian, he'll be English.   Race isn't an identity, except in the way we've culturally formed categories. There's more variation among individuals of a ""race"" than there is on average between two different races. What makes you black or white isn't an inherent identity, it's having lived in your culture as a black or a white person. As a white person, I've experienced the world differently than my black neighbor. My biracial godson will experience it differently than either of us, both because he has one white and one black parent, and also because he will live in a different time frame.   A white woman deciding to be black is a bit like an American deciding to become Swedish. Even if you move there, you can't replace your American experience with a Swedish one. Gender identity is inherent. Racial identity is cultural."
Equality,3a8znn,emmster,5,Thu Jun 18 05:39:52 2015 UTC,"Of course race is biological.   Black people are black, born to black parents. White people are white, born to white parents. That's genetics.

You could argue that he is, but that doesn't really change that the social category we've put him in is ""black."" You don't experience half the racism or get half the stereotypes by having one white parent.   Or how about this pair of twins You don't get much more similar to anyone who isn't your identical twin, but, we'd classify one sister as white, and one as black. If race is such a biological fact, how is that even possible?   Human variation in appearance and ability is biological. Which I think is what you're thinking of.

Psychologist John Money oversaw the case and reported the reassignment as successful and as evidence that gender identity is primarily learned. Academic sexologist Milton Diamond later reported that Reimer failed to identify as female since the age of 9 to 11,  and transitioned to living as a male at age 15. Well known in medical circles for years anonymously as the ""John/Joan"" case, Reimer later went public with his story to help discourage similar medical practices.

Equality,3a16ec,7801927,3,Tue Jun 16 12:37:07 2015 UTC,"I've definitely noticed the same thing, though my situation is different, as my boyfriend and I make a near-equal wage ($.50/hr diff) but his supplemental income is considerably greater than mine. Unlike me, however, he is required to pay child support to his ex (though we have the kids half the week) and has some debt to payoff whereas I am debt-free.  We split everything 50/50, and will probably continue to do so even if he gets a substantial raise before me (likely). He is actually underpaid for his skills as he had to take a pay cut after a period of unemployment. My workforce experience and skills are substantially lacking compared to his, and I am compensated fairly for my work (it helps that 4/5 of my company are women, including the CEO and all the VPs). So for me, there is nothing for me to reconcile - the parts of the scale are tipped slightly toward him if you're looking purely at income, but when you factor everything into the equation, he is actually at an economic disadvantage, which I think in my relationship ultimately balances out the social disadvantages (eg the chores you mentioned) that I have.  I think the key is to be open with your partner. If you feel your contributions relative to your compensation (economic or otherwise) are greater than his, talk to him about it and see if you can find a way to compromise. He may not know your disadvantages unless you explain them.  It's important to remember that relationships and equality are both about much more than finances. Take a step back from household economics for a second and ask if your partner contributes in other ways, not just financially. And most importantly, communicate! If an equal relationship is important to you, you need to make sure he is on the same page.  It is exhausting, but if it's that important to you (and I imagine it is!) it's worth the work."
Equality,3a16ec,katielovestrees,3,Tue Jun 16 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"I think about it in terms of equity instead of equality. (This may not speak to your point of gender inequality since I'm a lesbian, but I think it works in any relationship where income isn't equal.)  When I lived with my ex we each put 70% of our income into a joint account to pay common household bills, dinners out, vacation saving, etc. When we started dating I was on unemployment and making more than she was working part time. We each put 80% of our income into a joint account for household bills, dinners out, vacation savings, etc. She was left with only about $20 fun money each pay period and I was left with a lot more, but I also put in more to bills.   Then my unemployment stopped and she made more than me. So I put in 0% and she put in about 100%. But I took on about 99% of household chores/cooking.   Then I started working and made more than her again. We moved back to each making a 70% contribution.  Then she got a full time job as well as her part time job, and was making more than me. So we moved to each putting in 55% of our income.  Then she quit her part time job, and was making less again.   I think you get it. Outside of systemic pay inequality there can be a myriad of reasons why partners make different salaries.   As far as the cleaning/time at home, we paid a cleaning person as part of the household budget. This was mandatory for me because I was the one doing the majority of cleaning (as she had never lived alone and really just never learned how one has to approach cleaning her own place). The most equitable way to split the cleaning when I was clearly putting in more effort was to have someone else do it. I tried making a list of all household chores and splitting them, but I was still having to nag about her doing her share (and I was the one with more extra-curriculars and out of the house more). The tangible splitting method may work for some.  I think the most important piece of this is both parties realizing there is an inequality and both parties being part of the solution."
Equality,3a16ec,jenzthename,3,Tue Jun 16 22:45:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm not understanding your question... You talk about equality between men and women as groups, but a relationship isn't between groups. You're not ""women,"" and you're not dating ""men."" Find a balance that works for the individuals in your relationship.  If you gravitated toward a lower paying job, or if your partner works tons of hours in exchange for higher pay (but less time and energy for chores), that's something for the two of you to sort out. I don't think you need to work more or he needs to do more housework in order to restore some abstract cosmic balance between the sexes. Ideally you're in a team, not a competition."

If the women went out for the same job as the men, they would be payed the same.  Ie: a mason earns more than a bus driver. The work is different. But more women would tend towards the bus driving job than working heavy, back breaking jobs such as masonry.  As for the house work division; my husband is way more neat and tidy than i. So he tends to do more housework than i do. It depends on the person in question."

Equality,3a16ec,iheartennui,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:05:01 2015 UTC,"Well in the same sense then, say that your partner wants to buy something for the household and you are not as excited about it as he is, he could contribute all of or the majority of the cost of that thing. I imagine your partner probably eats more than you (generally true due to physiological differences between genders) so it would probably be unfair for you to pay for half of all household food costs.  I'd say that, in general, he should pay more for stuff because he earns more. I would not say that that makes you unequal by any means: ""From each according to their ability, to each according to their need"" and all that. In my relationships, I am usually earning less than my SO, despite being the male. However, due to societal expectations, I find myself paying as much or even more for things when we are on dates than they are. I personally think the fairest is for those who earn the most to contribute the most when it comes to communal living situations, that is how I have always lived with roommates - supporting those who are financially less advantaged. Usually those earning less have more flexible jobs or are artists and can thus contribute to the household in ways that more money cannot, like by taking time to do more chores or decorating or looking after plants/animals etcetera.  To sum up: money is NOT distributed equally in this society. Different kinds of jobs are valued at different levels by the powers that be, regardless of time or skill committed to them. Therefore, paying for things equally in a household is not a way to achieve gender equality. Money happens to be something easily quantifiable which can give the illusion of equality but this is actually a much more subtle issue."
Equality,3a16ec,sirloin600,2,Tue Jun 16 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I never really noticed women getting payed less at my workplace (most of the few I've talked about compensation with get payed more then I, likely due to them having more experience) but you and your partner need to work out a system that works for you. There is no reason to expect them to pay more then 50:50 without talking about it with them. This may sound rude, but I dont mean it to be, but if your romantic partner making more money then you is such a big problem, get involved with someone who doesn't make so much money. You do have the ability to get involved with someone who is on equal financial grounds as you."

I'm referring  basically to the fact that women gravitate towards lower paying jobs.  I do understand that this is a choice but choice is complex in our society I think.   Maybe I havnt made wise choices, and I don't want my partner to subsidise me in anyway. I'm just wondering in general what people thought about how this impacts gender roles in the home really."

What I am saying is that each equality movement has been largely removed from the idea of human equality. Yes, there were many women's rights movements in the 70's, but what I don't understand is why was it just about women's rights? Would the movement not be more successful if all groups formed one movement to fulfill all of their respective lack of rights/equality?   I mean, their end goals don't have many discrepancies between them. It's just that the inequalities projected on various groups are different problems...

Equality,32s7cb,Selongb,3,Thu Apr 16 07:55:15 2015 UTC,"Socially, we have this thing where pair-bonded humans get together and form a mutual agreement to work together as partners. We call this partnership marriage and government helps keep it organized by recognizing certain legal rights. You can visit your spouse in the hospital, you usually each have legal guardianship of your children, you can manage your joint estate if your partner dies, and if things don't work out, you can break away from your partner, dissolve the agreement, and find a new partner.  Government is very interested in keeping marriage as a social institution, because there's so many things that would need to be entirely redone from scratch if they replaced marriage with something else.  Everyone is free to get married, regardless of their faith or lack of faith or which faith they believe in. The reason churches encourage folks to get married in their spaces is because they're interested in stable community members that will have positive ties to the church community. Look at the big moments in a Catholic's life: for birth, coming-of-age, marriage, and death, there's a corresponding sacrament that keeps you bound to the church from cradle to grave.  Now, on that point... Some faiths say that they only approve of certain pair-bondings, that those partnerships are the only ""correct"" ones... And they push to get their views backed, codified, and enforced by secular laws. Nevermind that many of these faiths either performed all-inclusive partnerships in the past, or the early members of their church simply didn't care about people's sexual orientation, welcoming all in fellowship... What matters to these people now is that their church says these pair-bondings are right and those pair-bondings are wrong.  And they could hold that belief just as long as they like, but since they're pushing it with secular law, now the laws that apply to everybody are bound by the views of a group that doesn't include everyone. In pushing for these ""religious freedom"" laws, these groups are actually denying rights and legal benefits to other law-abiding citizens, including members of their own faiths, and that is a problem."

Equality,322usy,werts334,9,Fri Apr 10 03:13:50 2015 UTC,"Universities try to do this. It's difficult for an admissions officer to determine who is the ""most promising"" when one student grew up in a significantly different environment than another. Universities attempt to normalize this difference through a number of initiatives, including affirmative action. The affirmative action programs also serve a number of other functions, including bringing diversity to the campus.   While your proposition initially sounds attractive -- and, in fact, roughly describes a system called a ""meritocracy"" in a nutshell and is the basis for a number of successful schema -- you cannot blindly adhere to an attractive philosophy without considering and addressing its drawbacks.   Assuming SAT scores are the best metric of a ""promising applicant,"" the the racial gap between scores indicates that, under your system, the top college campuses would be a rather homogeneous mixture of wealthy Caucasians with a significant Asian minority. This imbalance incurs innumerable, incalculable costs. The cycle is also self-perpetuating (e.g., parents who valued education as children are more likely to inspire their children to value education) and would contribute to America's wealth and racial divide.  On the other hand, adding in factors for college admissions other than pure ""merit"" (simplified, in this case, to SAT scores) has numerous benefits. I probably can't say it better than the U.S. Supreme Court:   These benefits are substantial. [. . .] [An affirmative action] admissions policy promotes ""cross-racial understanding,"" helps to break down racial stereotypes, and ""enables [students] to better understand persons of different races."" These benefits are ""important and laudable,"" because ""classroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting"" when the students have ""the greatest possible variety of backgrounds.""   [This] compelling interest [in diversity] is further bolstered by [. . .] the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity. [. . . N]umerous studies show that student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and ""better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and better prepares them as professionals.""  These benefits are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints.   Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 330 (2003) (internal citations removed).  As a side note, you seem to imply that universities currently set ""ethnic quotas."" Public universities do not, and, in fact, cannot under US law establish rigid quotas for minority students. I'm not sure if private universities can, but they generally wouldn't want to do so.   As a second side note, there are many other benefits to enforcing equality in our society. I focused my reply on why a pure meritocracy probably isn't the best system because that seemed to be the thrust of your question. Some proponents of equality may, for example, argue that we, as a society, are morally obligated to assist the less fortunate.   TL;DR: I guess this is a long-winded way, using higher education as a proxy for everything else, of explaining that there's no easy way to define ""the best"" individuals in an extremely heterogeneous group. Oftentimes, attempting to define ""the best"" results in a self-perpetuating skew towards the most privileged members of the society. This has negative consequences. Enforcing equality serves to oppose these negative consequences through a variety of pathways. One of those pathways is increasing and perpetuating diversity, which has a positive impact on our society."
Equality,322usy,noaz,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:02:45 2015 UTC,"I understand that a lot of the times when it comes to things such as education, there is an imbalance in the academic performance between rich and poor. However, this imbalance seems to occur because of a lack of ""equal opportunity"" in the first place, no? The Washington Post article you posted clearly highlights this by saying student ""who had the opportunity to take the PSAT in highschool"" score higher (Goldfarb 1). This shows that opportunity is clearly not equal because if it was then every child should be able to take the PSAT. I believe as a society we advanced so far as to eliminate, for the most part, many racial injustices (although many still do exist and should not be ignored). By following that train of logic, it would then make sense to establish equal opportunity that allows every student to score just as high as their peers as long as they work hard enough for it, which will then create a naturally diverse university based off of merit and advanced academics instead of one based off of diversity and social issues. I don't know. I'm just playing devils advocate. It's at least fun to think about though."
Equality,322usy,noaz,2,Fri Apr 10 11:51:46 2015 UTC,"In order to shoehorn a pure meritocracy into today's society, you're proposing that we establish equality across the board from birth until we can accurately measure a student's potential (again, I won't really address how one would propose to address a student's potential... this is a massive question unto itself that people with PhDs in education haven't been able to conclusively answer). As you might imagine, such an endeavor would be extremely difficult. Far more difficult than attempting corrections on the back end through programs like affirmative action.  The levels of inequality that you would seek to eliminate are incredibly deep (some might even argue that many social inequalities are inherent to the proper functioning of pure capitalism). They range from things like malnutrition and poor housing to systemic, pervasive racism and sexism. Society tries to level this playing ground through a variety of methods, including providing government housing, offering free school lunches, and educating the population on diversity. Clearly, these efforts have been insufficient to establish equality from birth 'til testing. Doing so would require a  monumental effort in terms of both a massive cultural shift and an incredibly large economic push. I'm not going to provide numbers because I don't want this to turn into a research project, but imagine providing an SAT prep class for every single student in the country...  You mentioned how the article demonstrated that students who took a PSAT prior to the SAT did better. This is a good example of something we could do to better prepare some students, but it's also a good example of conflating variables. Students that have the opportunity to take a PSAT, as you might imagine, often have other factors going for them, such as wealth or a generational interest in education. I'm sure taking the PSAT before the SAT is helpful, but I'm also sure that the factors allowing you to take the PSAT to begin with are going to be more determinative of your skill in taking the SAT.  This discussion of the merits of affirmative action in education has now, however, drifted from the initial question of ""is equality a good thing?"" because you've shifted to asking a completely different question: ""is how we enforce equality today the best way to promote it?"" Theoretically, almost certainly not. Practically, probably not either, but there are other concerns, like economics, politics, and dearly-held beliefs that hamper such enforcement.  Backtracking to the original question, equality is a good thing because it provides tangible and intangible benefits to society. In the context of your question, it allows for a system like a meritocracy -- in and of itself a worthy scheme for promotion and social movement -- to work with fewer drawbacks."

Equality,322usy,MuaddibMcFly,3,Fri Apr 10 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"I've always thought of quotas as being a good way to kick-start equality, because prejudice will naturally prevent the admission of the best and brightest. Give a leg up to some of the best and brightest among an oppressed class, and they'll gradually break down the prejudices by proving them incorrect, and getting other people used to having them around in an environment they were previously excluded from. Quotas probably shouldn't be hugely dramatic in scale, but they are a useful tool in the creation of a state of equality, which over time should become redundant anyway."
Equality,322usy,Selongb,2,Fri Apr 10 10:38:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, but how do you determine who is the brightest, most promising applicants?  Say you have two candidates applying to the most prestigious university in the world.  Both score in the 99.99th percentile in Math.  Both score in the 99.99th percentile in Social Sciences.  Both wrote an amazing, moving application essay.  Both were captains of their varsity sports teams (and they played sports all 3 school seasons).  Both were active in volunteer organizations, etc.  Now lets say that candidate A comes from Compton and Candidate B comes from Beverly Hills.

Equality,322usy,MuaddibMcFly,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:15:30 2015 UTC,"Neither, until you look at the home life of these student, let me present some hypotheticals;  Compton: Although he lived in what would be universally referred to as the ghetto, student A had parents who had big dreams for their son. They raised him to put education before everything else, his father took an extra job to pay for his athletic activities, and his mother stayed up with him, helping him to understand his homework. He rose to the top of his class and graduated valedictorian.  Beverly Hills: After a rough divorce, Candidate B never saw his father again. His mother became depressed and barley paid any mind to her children. Candidate B's own brother took to delinquency to try to call out for attention and dropped out of school at 16. Candidate B saw this and didn't want to go down the same road. He picked himself up and put his nose to the grind, raising his grades to the best in the school and with the addition of a weekend job, B paid for his Athletic activities. B graduated Valedictorian, despite the president set by his older brother.   In these scenarios, B is far more impressive than A, and race wasn't brought up once, which goes to show that the place of ones birth nor the color of their skin should matter, but rather how they were raised."

But I think that word, 'cis gender', as others have pointed out, is not intended to be offensive, merely descriptive. Was that all that upset you?   You also claim ""SJW's"" are making the struggle for equality worse. In what way? What exactly makes someone an ""SJW"" anyway?

Equality,310vlj,Aquamanic4,2,Wed Apr 1 06:27:18 2015 UTC,SJW is basically anyone that would argue that your life is automatically perfect if you are a) male b) white c) able-bodied d) straight e) cisgender. Yes the term cis is not offensive however the post did mention that the SJW in question said his life is perfect because OP is cisgender.

I don't really think there can be any debate over the legitimacy of that claim since study after study after study show it to be correct.   That said there are certainly people who believe that being a straight white man assures a healthy, happy, and prosperous life which is of course total insanity.  I think all that can be said for those people is that they lack the life experience to form a more nuanced world view.  That's something that comes with time.  It's good to know there is inequality in the world and better to understand some of the reasons for it.  However it's best to also have the life experiences required for that knowledge to be utilized effectively and empathetically."

It also incorporates a desire to censor and harass those who don't conform to what the person believes to be the right course of action, without discussion or argument. That's what SJW has come to mean to me, and you'd be surprised how many actually do describe themselves as that way. The term, I believe, was originally theirs after all.  Why does this make the struggle worse? In my opinion it's the total opposite of equality. How can equality come out of such intolerance? Their goals may seem to coincide with equality at the moment, but their methods can be used for whatever new goal they desire. If you shout down and harass a racist do you think you've changed their mind? Have you helped bring an understanding and acceptance? No, you've just muted their voice in the current situation. Their actions and opinions still exist in the real world and they still pass on their hatred. You cannot teach understanding by belittling and insulting, and equality cannot exist without understanding.  You are correct that 'cis gender' is just a descriptive term. However, so is black, gay, female, Muslim, etc. Any of these used to describe a person as though that is their sole identity can be seen as demeaning in the right context, no?"

Which is why i'm slightly saddened by your post:   It is quite sad to see this happen when if they want true equality for everyone then they need to learn to SHUT THE FUCK UP.   I strongly disagree! This quote right here really captures the essence of everything that is currently wrong with the equality debate - we have a lot of different opinions about what ""equality"" really is, and who it really is that's being opressed. The true problem is that people are unwilling to listen to people with a different point-of-view.

Friendship, if it means anything, means caring and attentive conversation, in equal measure, about the concerns, joys and sorrows of your interlocutor.   Equal measure. In the truest friendship both beings are equal. The conversation is balanced. Once this balance tilts the friendship becomes unhealthy and flawed.  I wish to be friends with all of humanity that will join me in friendship. Those who refuse are welcome to exist outside of my realm, but I will not interact with them.

Equality,2zr19f,pineapple_warhorse,7,Sat Mar 21 02:49:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think enough people realize how sexism in general, and misogyny in particular, hurt men, too.   Which do you think hurts men more: misogyny or misandry?  [Edit: phrasing]"
Equality,2zr19f,nonsensepoem,-1,Sat Mar 21 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"That's a matter of perspective, I think. Misandry and misogyny are both consequences of the same imbalanced sociocultural climate. I feel strongly that both are toxic toward our happiness and development as human beings, but it seems to me that a lot of the sexism directed at men can be attributed to cultural misogyny. As the link points out, most of the insults commonly thrown at men attack their masculinity and accuse them of being feminine in some way. This is mainly because there's a widespread, though often unspoken, cultural attitude that women are ""lesser"" than men; the worst thing a man can be is like a woman, basically. That's misogyny despite it being aimed at men, because it ultimately stems from a sexist attitude against women.   That's not to say that there aren't sexist attitudes toward men that aren't based in misogyny. The notion that men don't have control of themselves when it comes to sexual behavior doesn't seem to be rooted in misogyny, for instance. I take such exception to people who tell women they need to dress modestly because it will entice men to assault them, because that's basically saying men are animalistic and incapable of regulating their actions. That's such bullcrap- I have more faith in the male gender than that.   So, to attempt to answer your question, I think that misogyny is a larger systematic problem (in that it's more pervasive, not more important); accordingly, it's not unreasonable to conclude that perhaps more of the sexism men face is a reflection of misogynist attitudes. I think all sexism needs to be weeded out, regardless of the source. Both men and women suffer in society the way it is, and that's not ok."
Equality,2zr19f,pineapple_warhorse,6,Sat Mar 21 18:57:48 2015 UTC,You appear to be saying that hatred of women (misogyny) hurts men more than hatred of men (misandry) hurts men. Is that correct?
Equality,2zr19f,nonsensepoem,-1,Sat Mar 21 20:44:51 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. I think that, in terms of the quality of the pain, they're probably both equally painful. Sexism hurts, period, regardless of the source. I don't think misogyny is more damaging in its effects than misandry, just that it's more commonplace and normalized in society, and therefore it may be responsible for a higher quantity of the discrimination men face. Misandry is no less toxic or important than misogyny, and I in no way intend to minimize its impact. We absolutely have to recognize and strive to eliminate all forms of sexism.   I think it's also important to note that, just because misogyny is somewhat more systematically embedded in our (Western) society, it doesn't mean that men suffer less than women or that their struggles are less valid or difficult. My research has illustrated that, in the past couple decades, American men (American here, so I'll speak to what I know best) in particular have been grappling with a lot of shifting and often conflicting expectations and demands. What it means to ""be a man"" is in a state of flux, and it's been hard for dudes to deal with. They're told to be open about their emotions, then immediately admonished not to be emotional; they're still generally expected to be family breadwinners, but also to be super involved and caring dads who don't miss a single Little League game; they're presented with a very narrow spectrum of ""accepted"" physical attractiveness, then told they're somehow lesser men if they're not super confident regardless of appearance.   Bottom line, we're all (men and women) caught in this crappy social net of clashing expectations and demands where basically no one can win. The only way to make life better for everyone is a cooperative effort to fight discrimination and a willingness to reach across perceived divides and engage in constructive dialogue."

In order for objectification to be immoral 2 criteria must first be met: 1. Actual objectification and 2. Lack of consent  Merely being sexually attracted to another human being is not 'objectifying them'. People are attracted to people, not objects. If anything, it is personalizing them even more. There must be a deliberate effort to strip away personality and ideology in favor of the purely physical.  And then objectification can be mutually beneficial to all involved if the one being objectified agrees or even encourages this objectification.

Equality,2x85ot,Anonymous_Ascendent,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:02:48 2015 UTC,"Consent doesn't factor into objectification, nor does harm or victimization.  Objectification just means treating a person like an object.  The question is whether fictional characters should be counted as people, or whether they are objects to begin with.  I tend to think they fall somewhere in the middle.  Characters are objects in that they serve whatever story they're written into.  They're people in that they have their own thoughts and feelings within the story, and we often empathize with them.  We both agree that sexual attraction is not the same thing as objectification, but we disagree about the details.  Yes, people are attracted to people.  No, most of us aren't attracted to objects.  Objectification doesn't have to be literal though.  If I'm making one of those god-awful perfume commercials where two semi-clad models stare at each other on a beach and nothing happens, it's their bodies that are being used to sell the product, not their personalities.  That is objectification, and it may be financially beneficial for the models, the perfume company, and my production staff, but the ""characters"" are still being objectified.  Is this sort of objectification harmful?  Hard to say.  Obviously the characters don't care because they aren't real, but if watching these commercials changes your perception of men/women, it may be harmful to the viewer and their future partners (and there is evidence to suggest that what we watch effects our perception of real people).  If objectifying a character leads you to objectify your partner, you're both going to have a bad time."
Equality,2x85ot,Celestaria,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:17:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't say 'in order for their to be objectification there must be lack of consent', I said 'in order for objectification to be immoral there must be a lack of consent'. Objectification can absolutely exist completely independent from consent, or lack thereof. However, my position is that any individual should be able to chose whether they want to be objectified (so it's not always bad).  An analogy would be trading for a new car. If someone consents to selling you their car for $500 then nothing immoral has occurred, everyone wins. However, if someone did not consent to that but you shoved the $500 dollars into their mailbox and drove off in the car anyway that would be immoral.   I can see the argument of indirect oppression through publicized objectification, but again nobody is being forced to do anything they don't want. You can argue against that objectification, turn the TV channel or make your own TV anti-objectification TV show. What you cannot do is force those who are making choices about their own bodies to comply with your moral standards. This is the root of slut-shaming."

It's certainly something that content creators should be mindful off, if only because they might end up angering their core audience.  It's also fair for consumers to complain if they are angered by objectification, at which point the content creators will have to decide whether it's worth alienating one group to pander to another."

The reason why the pay gap myth is so widespread is because they take all people employed across every field, and average it out. So since there are more men in high paying science, engineering, and computer tech jobs, they get paid on average more than women doing human resources, or pre University teaching, for example. Not really as shocking as the graph would have you believe.  But if you were to take two people (1 male, 1 female). Both with 4 a 4 year degree, and both with 5 years experience in the field... If they have the same job, they would probably get paid the same. If they just got a new job.  However... Take those same people, and let's say that the woman took 3 years off to raise a child. Would you consider it fair that she gets a salary equal to someone with 3 more years of work experience?   You really need to account for these things. Which is why, in some deceptive studies, they forget to mention these things. So it makes it look like, even when both people have the same education, and same job... Why is the man getting paid more? It must be sexism/patriarchy/whatever.    edit: Here is a link that proves the pay gap to be a myth.

Hardly.    edit 2 PDF saying this...   Extant economic research has identified numerous factors that contribute to the gender wage gap.  Many of the factors relate to differences in the choices and behavior of women and men in balancing  their work, personal, and family lives.

Other factors are sources of wage adjustments that compensate specific  groups of workers for benefits or duties that disproportionately impact them. Such factors for which  empirical evidence has been developed include health insurance, other fringe benefits, and overtime  work.    It is not possible to produce a reliable quantitative estimate of the aggregate portion of the raw gender  wage gap for which the explanatory factors that have been identified account. Nevertheless, it can  confidently be concluded that, collectively, those factors account for a major portion and, possibly,  almost all of the raw gender wage gap.      This one shows how women in their 20s actually make 17% more than men in their 20s.    This graph using this resource states that as far as part-time work is concerned... Men earn 52% less than women."

We're all entitled to our opinions and I don't think it's fair to be downvoted based on mine, especially in this subreddit.   With that being said, I don't see a solid arguement that the pay gap is a myth. Your first link actually proves the pay gap does exist and on what levels to different groups of women. And regardless if it is a 4% pay gap or a 20%, that is STILL inequality.  I agree that it doesn't exist in all industries and it isn't as severe as it is portrayed.   Income graph at the end aside, I thought it was a great representation of the women who paved the way for equality. The graph at the end is hardly the point of the entire piece."

That would likely get knowing smiles from every other married person there. It's happened to half of them.  Married couples wouldn't be shocked at all.  There is a weird thing about respect and consent in long-term relationships - they get blurry. You dedicate your life to someone and then take advantage of them, use them, and happily let them do the same to you.   Those 10 women knew that. They'd done all sorts of things with their husbands and had no doubt that the other 9 had as well.   a lot of women who would judge men and call them pigs for such behavior are the same women reading this book and behaving the same way.

If my wife called me into the room for sexy times after reading lady porn, I'd be super happy about the sexy times because it's rarer for her to initiate, and because saying ""let's have sex"" is adequate foreplay for me. If I called my wife into the room for sexy times because I had been reading dude porn (why does lady porn sound normal, but dude porn sounds like dudes makin' out?) she'd be rightfully annoyed at me for not acknowledging that she has more in-depth arousal requirements than just a request.   There are double standards here, it's true. 50 shades gets read on public transport without a second thought; if I was reading Carl's Voyage through Vulvatown on the bus I'd get stares, not the least of which would be due to the fact that that's a terrible title for erotica. However, depending on the relationship dynamic, it's not fair to assume that it's a double standard for ladies to be allowed to call guys over for instant nookie.

I observe way more judgement towards a man who either posts similar topics or would bring this up freely in social situations.  Don't focus on the fact I used the word ""inequality"" just focus on the fact that if you observe this you will notice this silent double standard.  Men are judged harsher when talking about these subjects to strangers or unknown people in social situations, while women tend to be able to get away with it.    Keep it simple... If I go out with my wife's co workers that I do not know and start talking about soft/hard porn and how it makes me horny, I am pretty sure I would get negative judgement instantly. Yet they can freely talk about reading some book or movie with hot men in them that make them horny and laugh about how they then use their boyfriend/husband as sex objects. Some how this is acceptable conversation that the men that are there should be ok with while they are present, but that table turns if I start talking about these same topics about women while women are present.

The damage from those things has not only been done, but it's passed into normality according to larger cultural beliefs.  For every person who wants to examine those things and try to make things better, there's ten other people screaming that those problems don't exist, most of which are people who benefit from the privileges afforded to them by those systems and see the loss of those privileges as a kind of ""reverse discrimination.""

Most people in first world countries act like this if people are nice to them they are nice back. If all you do is look at stuff on the internet it is easy to think that your being 'oppressed' every group can find evidence of transgressions. I am not saying there are no problems every group has some disadvantage and yes that's right even white straight cisgender men face certain types of discrimination. Problem is some of today's 'activists' like to say only their group faces discrimination which cause people to think they should only work for their group and not equality for all groups. I'm fairly sure it isn't that bad in America but in Britain there is a tiny racist minority that no one takes seriously and only serves for people to make fun of them.   In conclusion every group faces discrimination, very few people think that discrimination is okay. Everyone just be nice.  P.S. Shitty society? are you kidding? this is the best life has been since it began on this planet! Society is great! a small amount of people are shitty but most are okay.

Equality,2vlxv2,Aquamanic4,6,Thu Feb 12 09:48:57 2015 UTC,"Sure!  Homosexuality is considered a crime in several countries, and in many of the countries where it is not, marriage benefits still do not extend to same-sex couples.  (these laws also discriminate against binary transgender people in heterosexual relationships)  I could give you a very long list of names of people whose deaths prove that people of color are still very regularly discriminated against, often with the blessing of the law.  (See: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, the Chapel Hill shooting that happened NOT EVEN TWO DAYS AGO)  Women are still fighting legal battles against countries and states that refuse to strike down laws violating their intrinsic human right to bodily autonomy, specifically around the issue of reproduction and abortion.  Gender identity is still in a very poor situation legally, with many countries requiring asinine and essentialist ""proofs"" in order to change someone's gender marker in official/legal systems. (certain places require proof of specific surgeries to do so, which fails those many transgender people who cannot or do not wish to undergo those surgeries)  ""Gender Identity Disorder"" still exists as a valid diagnosis in many mental healthcare facilities in the United States, and it is still legal for parents with gender-variant children to subject them to horrific ""conversion therapies,"" which applies to sexuality as well.  The thing is, there is a difference between discrimination and examples of systemic inequality like racism or transphobia.  That's why people keep saying that racism or sexism is ""prejudice plus power,"" which should not be taken to mean that people of a marginalized social class are infalliable and incapable of discrimination.  It underlines the very large difference between a man prejudiced against women, and a woman prejudiced against men.  The """"""reverse discrimination"""""" I was talking about was how some men complain that they can't flirt with women in the same ways or places that they could in the past.  Sexual harassment in the workplace is always unacceptable, no matter who is doing it to whom, but women have faced it (and still face it) disproportionately for a long enough time that it has been thought of as ""normal,"" so people are currently trying to enforce policies more strongly to correct for that.  That's not discrimination against men, that's men losing a privilege that they never should have had in the first place.  I will say that there are definitely a lot of people and places that may be over-correcting, but that's what comes with trying to change, and as things settle into a new normal with more inherently understood expectations of behaviour, the over-correction should likely dial back too.  Of course; western society is in one of the best places it's ever been in recorded history, but there are still a lot of problems for a lot of people.  We have a long way to go if we ever want to do any more than pretend we have an equal society."
Equality,2vlxv2,privilegeispower,0,Thu Feb 12 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"I am not wholly familiar with american law so I am sad to hear that is the case but it is the only example I have heard so far of actual institutionalised discrimination. Racism is not institutionalised any more even in the american police force as hard as it may be to believe; I am not saying that those deaths and the subsequent lack of punishment for the officers is not a travesty of justice but there is no reason to suggest that all courts and all police are racist so therefore neither of those institutions can be considered racist as a whole.   Don't misunderstand me I believe those killings were an outrage but were not due to just inherent racism in the police force of america but rather a number of factors including incompetence and gun control however it's a rather long explanation.  Again sorry to hear that is the case in America however I don't think abortion laws are discrimination so much as the belief that foetuses should be allowed human rights. For the record I do think abortions should be legal however I am just pointing out that sexism is not the reason they are illegal.  Gender identity is a tricky issues mainly because it makes it hard to classify people for a number of things and for records; medical ones especially will require knowledge of the persons birth sex. I agree conversion therapy is a disgrace however that is an america centric problem as most other western countries, including where I live, consider that highly illegal.  Unfortunately you cannot redefine a word to suit your movements end and prejudice plus power is ultimately untrue and also is impossible to apply. For instance if there was a female manager who fired a man for being male that would be sexist by this definition and so even with this incorrect definition you cannot apply it to just one gender, race etc.  The problem with over-corrections such as the university rape courts is that the worst ones tend to cause harsh punishment on people who really don't deserve it or are completely innocent which goes against the entire ethos of a just legal system. There is no difference between a women being bigoted towards men and a man being bigoted women because that argument would only work is women had no benefits over men but they do for example being given reduced or even acquitted of sentences that would have been much harsher for men. I am not justifying sexual harassment but rather saying that in today's society women are not as marginalised as you seem to think and are also men are actually a minority as far as sex is concerned. Women have advantages over men just the same as men have advantages over women and it is easy to say that men have had advantages for longer but that doesn't justify ignoring inequality's towards men we should focus on both sides of the issue rather than just one!  When people talk about 'reverse discrimination' (discrimination) they generally refer to things that affect only one group in your example a law that makes men flirting with women illegal but women flirting with men is still legal. This is of course a hypothetical by true to form example of how 'reverse discrimination' (discrimination) is actually an inequality in some cases. A true example is the fact that a man can be convicted of raping a women but in our legal system a women can never be convicted of raping a man and that man would have to pay child support if the women was impregnated when raping her. Both cases are just as bad but yet one isn't punished as much because of the persons gender this is discrimination.  You may notice I have talked about men's problems more than I have talked about women's and I mean to clarify that I by no means think they are more important but rather I am just trying to show how even a group considered to have more advantages can still be discriminated against and how women can be sexist. If you had been an MRA arguing that women's problems aren't as important I would have used more examples with women to try and show that they are equally important.  I believe unfortunately that you are judging western society by Americas standards which (and I don't want to start a 'my country is better than yours' argument) is generally a lot more radical and unjust than other western societies such as western Europe because many of your examples do not apply here. But even america does not constitute shitty society as a description."

You're missing the point, but you aren't American so its easy to see why.  Historical prejudice has placed a filter on how America views the black male as inherently violent, criminal, unintelligent, and a host of other NEGATIVE connotations. Police can (and often do) easily rush to these historical stereotypical fallacies and as a result, approach and engage black men as dangerous, untrustworthy, and often armed and dangerous.  Seriously, I can list close to thirty black men who were gunned down by policemen while being unarmed. Some even in OPEN CARRY STATES.   What does it say when many white men can open carry and even get approached by police in a peaceful manner (http://youtu.be/x7Gx73R3p1U, http://youtu.be/p1WIeV68Eeo, etc), but in repeated instances, black men are gunned down for the SUSPICION of carrying weapons they don’t even have!  Furthermore, Officer Darren Wilson’s (from Ferguson) portrayal of Michael Brown was a sickening and disgusting continuation of a historical depiction of unruly black men as animals, demons, and savages. (http://time.com/3605346/darren-wilson-michael-brown-demon/; http://www.npr.org/.../in-darren-wilsons-testimony...)   This just underscores the point that our society paints an unfair and unjust picture of black men, which serves to dehumanize them, and in times of conflict, it essentially makes it easier for others in power to cognitively justify their deaths.  Moreover, I will paraphrase from another blog… “Another issue at hand here is that the media describes White versus Black crime differently. For a quick, timely example, look at how Mike Brown is immediately vilified and described as “no angel” while Ted Bundy, a horrific mass murderer, is given way more than the benefit of the doubt (http://www.dailykos.com/.../-Comparing-How-The-New-York...) and even more examples here: (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/.../media-black-victims_n...). This isn’t just the media, though. The American Psychological Association reported that Black boys are seen as older and as less innocent than White boys (http://www.apa.org/.../rele.../2014/03/black-boys-older.aspx).”   This is the definition of institutionalized racism, and this one example of many is pointed at black men.  There are examples of this for many POC and minority populations.    Again, I don't expect you to understand because you don't *live in this world"" that is America."

There are also many articles about how unjust and what a horrific act the killing of Michael Brown was.   Why did you refer to society as a whole when you specifically meant the US?  I suppose the reason I felt I needed to talk about this was because a lot of people tend to paint europe with the same brush as america which is really annoying because in reality it is eastern europeans who probably get the most discrimination in the uk not black people .

Equality,2vlxv2,NateExMachina,2,Thu Feb 19 03:27:21 2015 UTC,"Feminist theory is inherently censoring and authoritarian. Women only spaces and trigger warnings are part of it. It's also strongly postmodernist, which is where the thought policing comes from; and based heavily on Marxism, which excludes libertarians.  The majority of feminist definitions are also anti-male. ""Power"" ignores the cost of responsibility. ""Sexism = power + prejudice"" erases male victims and the male experience. ""Patriarchy"" assumes a system perpetuates itself only for the benefit of men. Even the word ""feminism"" meaning ""equality"" is absurd, because a gendered word is antithetical to equality. It's made even more absurd when the same group who refuses to use a genderless label is completely obsessed with political correctness.  This is not the result of a few bad apples. This is the logical conclusion of feminist dogma. Sam Harris criticized religion saying ""the problem with fundamentalists is the fundamentals"". The same is true with feminism. The fundamentals of feminism are censorship, authoritarianism, and anti-male definitions."
Equality,2vlxv2,bilog78,3,Thu Feb 19 12:20:51 2015 UTC,"Given that I don't have time for a really long reply, I'm just going to put in the tl;dr, which is that my problem with this attitude towards feminism is exactly the same as my problem with Sam harris' attitude toward religion: categorically dismissing a heterogeneous value group based on an apparently homogeneous presentation by radicals.   Continuing the analogy, as an atheist I do not want my personal beliefs equated to those of Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins; yes, they have the same core belief about gods as I do, but beyond that we disagree on a wide range of topics. In my opinion they're radicals as well, and not representative of the heterogeneous majority.   I think we are arguing from different base definitions of what feminism is, though, which makes a lot of what we're saying pretty apples-to-oranges."
Equality,2vlxv2,NateExMachina,2,Thu Feb 19 15:35:10 2015 UTC,"Atheism is not a belief. Bald is not a hair color. Atheism does not have a holy book like religions do or a branch of unfalsifiable academic dogma like feminism does.  Secondly, you grossly misrepresented Sam Harris' attitude toward religion. He does NOT categorically dismiss a group. In fact, he specifically makes a distinction between moderates and fundamentalists, when arguing that moderates shield fundamentalists from criticism. He clearly knows that not all religious people are dangerous and has stated so many times. The point is: those that literally read teachings can become radicals. Being a radical is not a bad thing if the fundamentals are good. He gives the example of Jainists. A radical Janist is no harm to anyone around them. Why are there no Buddhist suicide bombers? What is it about the Quran that makes people do this?  I'll give my thoughts on this as well. I think religion largely functions to reinforce what people already believe. There are over 30,000 denominations of christianity. Surely people are picking and choosing passages, not based on what they think the author meant, but based on what they want to believe. But what happens when there's no way to make the book say what you want it to say? The quran is more dangerous than the bible because it allows a wider range of violence for those who want to believe in martyrdom.  I'm also going to take it a step further and argue that it doesn't matter what your definition of feminism is. I've never heard one that is justifiable, whether you're talking about ""feminist theory"", ""equality"", or even just ""women's rights"". He's a copy of something I wrote about why people shouldn't use the word ""feminism"".   A gendered word is antithetical to equality and absurd to use it as a synonym for that. It's especially absurd when feminists care so much about labels that some even want to use words like womyn and zhe.  The word ""feminist"" also suffers from the same problems as ""egalitarian"". The words are so broad that they are effectively meaningless. Why not find a more accurate label or describe your specific beliefs instead?  It also has a strong connotation. Studying equality is generally synonymous with learning how to be a good person. We already have a field of study for this. It's ""ethics"", a branch of philosophy. Note that how we treat the words ""ethicist"" and ""feminist"" are very different. They can describe both a person who studies how to be good and a person who is good. In practice, an ethicist only seems to describe a student of ethics, while a feminist describes a righteous identity. Imagine if you asked someone to describe themselves and they said ""I am a good person"". It would be condescending because it implies that others are not good.  With these three points in mind, each can be used in a dishonest way. Firstly, the gendered word makes it hard to criticize feminism, because its critics are often said to hate women. If the movement were simply about equality instead of equality for women, then this would not happen. This also presupposes that women do not have equality.  The second dishonest tactic is as Orwell described in my link above: ""meaningless"" labels are used to deceive the reader. When a writer uses the word ""feminist"" vaguely, the reader is forced to assume their own definition for the word. If this is done on a forum, it allows the writer to react to the reader. If the reader says ""feminism is good"", then the writer will agree, even though they know that their definition is almost certainly different from the reader. If the reader says ""feminism is bad"", then the writer will reveal just enough information to show that their definition of feminism is not the same as the reader's. This way, the writer can control the narrative by denying information.  The third way to deceive people is through the connotation of ""feminism"". Since ""feminist"" effectively means ""good person"", it can be used dogmatically. It means a person can give credibility to hateful ideas by parading them under the ""good person"" banner. Likewise, it can be used to bully people into accepting feminist policy. After all, if you disagree with a feminist, then you must be a bad person.  So in summary, the word ""feminism"" has three inherent problems:   It's a gendered word. It's a meaningless word. It's a righteous identity.    And this is just the beginning. This is an argument against even using the word ""feminism"". If you want to get into the details of feminist policies, that's an even bigger mess."

Ask anyone if the easter bunny exists. What will they say? The vast majority will flat out say ""no"".    The existence of the easter bunny, where the EB is defined as the creature that lays the painted chocolate eggs kids “hunt” for, can be trivially denied by remarking that the adults are the one placing the eggs for the hunt.    This is how things work in every area of our life.   No, this is how things work for well-defined entities whose existence can be proven or disproven on a logical/rational basis. This is not how things work for entities which are either not well defined, or which are well-defined but for which the definition doesn't provide hooks for proving or disproving their existence   Yet suddenly, when we talk about religion, both theists and atheists insist that we can't ""know"" that god doesn't exist.   No, that's not what theists and atheists insist on. That's what agnostics (be them theists and atheists) insist on. In fact, that's the very definition of agnostic: someone that believes that [whatever is being discussed] (or their existence) cannot be known.   I ask someone: ""Will the sun rise tomorrow?"" They say: ""Yes."" I ask someone: ""Does god exist?"" They say: ""I don't believe but I can't know for sure!! I really can't say! I'm a SKEPTIC!! :D""   Actually, the proper answer to the question “Does god exist?” is “What do you mean by god?”. Because the answer depends on how you define the concept of god. If whoever poses the question about the existence of god is referring to the God in the Bible, then the existence thereof can be easily denied on the basis of the logical inconsistencies of the properties the Bible assigns to the aforementioned God. So the answer would be “No, I believe such an entity cannot exist.” However, for more general concepts of god as supernatural/metaphysical entity that triggered the existence of the universe, the rational answer is “The question has no answer” (or a variation thereof).   And if you are an atheist, you will live your life as if you are sure a god doesn't exist, which is your default state.   Uh, no. If you're a strong atheist, you will live your life sure that a god doesn't exist, but if you're a weak atheist you will live your life without considering the existence of god. While under most respects the resulting behavior will be mostly the same, for the large part it will also be pretty much also the same behavior of a lot of people who do actually believe in some form of god. The belief in the existence of a god, the belief that no god exists (for any definition of god) or not having an opinion about it (which is actually the default state) tell us very little, in fact, about the individual.   Atheists have allowed religion to corrupt their dictionaries down to an epistemological level for this one topic,   What?   while the rest of the world lives at a metaphysical level.   What?   There is no god. That's not a belief.   Do you actually believe in what you write? If so, it is a belief.   It's just the practical conclusion when there's no evidence.

I mean, compare a random dude on the bus to you, a runner - you aren't going to have the same running abilities but I wouldn't consider the other guy ""at a disadvantage"" in LIFE in general. You'd just beat him in a race. In our general society, the outcome of a running race doesn't determine success or how you will be treated or anything like that. Since people aren't hunting down our food and running from predators, physical ability has little to do with societal hierarchy.   Also, if you're thinking that physical ability (like speed) has anything to do with equality, notice that the fastest people are Black men. History (and the present) has definitely NOT treated them as biologically superior or advantaged. If your thoughts about physical ability being related to equality were true, Black men would be at the top of the social ladder.

That said, there aren't many trans men (FTM) to begin with. Of those that exist, even fewer would be into athletics; fewer of those would be participating (or allowed to participate) on the professional level with other men, and even fewer good enough to win. I don't actually know any who are professional athletes. Many sports organisations still have issues with allowing trans people to participate with either gender.

Equality,2tftnt,Canuck85,3,Fri Jan 23 20:22:34 2015 UTC,"Well, the article does describe the three theories. But as a social psychologist, perhaps I can help to explain with a bit less jargon :)  Social identity theory is a complex theory that is difficult to explain concisely without leaving anything out. But essentially it describes the idea of ""ingroups"" and ""outgroups"", and suggests that people derive at least part of their own personal identity from the groups of which they are a member. Groups can essentially include anything, including gender, race, nationality, and religion, but also social clubs, schools, workplaces, etc. A core tenet of the theory is that people are motivated to obtain a positive self-identity, and as such, people gravitate toward groups they see positively (if they can), but also are motivated to perceive the groups they are a part of positively. This latter notion is known as ""ingroup favouritism/bias"", and can be accompanied by ""outgroup derogation"" -- both of which are just what they sound like. The theory also tries to describe various differences as a result of permeable vs. non-permeable groups (i.e., you can join a social club, but you can't generally ""join"" or ""leave"" a racial group), status differences between groups (e.g., rich vs. poor), the perceived legitimacy of those status differences (e.g., a poor capitalist might perceive themselves to be deserving of their place in society, while a poor socialist might fight against such status differences).  Social comparison theory similarly suggests that we tend to compare ourselves with other members of our ingroup in order to evaluate ourselves. However, one of the key features of this theory has to do with upward and downward social comparisons. Generally, when you threaten one's social situation (e.g., show data to White Americans showing that immigration may lead to Whites losing majority status), they tend to make downward social comparisons as a defensive reaction. In other words, instead of comparing with other people in your own group, you would compare yourself to people in a lower-status group. In some cases, people make upward social comparisons, but this tends to be threatening in and of itself, so it is not common; however, this can happen when people have the motives to self-enhance or self-improve. A basketball player comparing themselves to Michael Jordan might be encouraged to practice harder.  Optimal distinctiveness theory is quite simple: It suggests that people have a need to maintain a balance between their own self-identity and their group identity. When they feel too similar to the rest of the group, they tend to seek ways to become more distinct, while when they feel too isolated or unique, they tend to seek ways to assimilate with the group. There has been lots of research into personality differences and cultural differences that can influence to what extent people prefer distinctiveness over assimilation, but the idea is that everyone has sort of an ""optimal"" point somewhere along that continuum.  It should be noted that all of these theories are very broad and abstract, in the sense that it takes further work to turn them into concrete predictions. That makes them very fruitful for all kinds of research in a broad range of areas, but it does mean that the research tends to be somewhat scattered, and there are people who disagree over exactly what they might predict in a given situation. The first two theories in particular are at least 40 years old at this point, and were made in a time when psychologists tended to favour broad, all-encompassing theories. Psychology today has to some extent fractured into smaller theories that don't try to explain all behaviour everywhere, but as a result are more easily made into concrete predictions.  Hope that helps! If anything is still unclear, I'd be happy to answer further questions!"

So why is that when a women claims rape a man either has his life ruined or ends up in prison? innocent until proven guilty is it? Why is that we are legally all equal but more domestic  violence, homelessness, custody rights, and a bunch more are still overlooked? and we shouldn't just say let's focus men's mental and emotional health because that's like saying well a guy got beat by his girlfriend so it's not that important. we need awareness of EVERYTHING."
Equality,2teklo,opek,1 point,Fri Jan 23 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"Why is it that you don't seem to give a damn about any of the other things? If you really think more energy should go into false rape accusations than men's welfare, paternity rights, worker rights, and everything thing else, then you really don't belong on this sub. The public focus should be on raising the standard for men's health, mental stability, and recognition of those issues.  False accusations are always an issue, but the system for reporting rape in the States is usually so messed up that many victims recant because police told them that would be their best recourse.  Also, I feel that you were confused about the domestic violence issue. It handles both male victims and assailants, as well as potential assailants. By talking to individual men, helping them through one-on-one and group therapy, we are better able to prevent DV against others. There are a couple of interesting articles on various groups around the US, but they usually emphasize reform of former convicts."

Saying that one thing is unfair for one group does not necessitate that other things aren't unfair for other groups.  If you are for equality, you should be able to say ""in this case men are disadvantaged"" without it following that ""in all cases men are the ones who are disadvantaged"" or ""we need to stop fighting for equality for groups that are not disadvantaged in this single case""  As for child custody (at least as it applies to the US), when you take out the cases where men didn't sue for custody, men and women receive about equal judgements.  That probably doesn't mean much in your case, which may indeed be unfair and biased (and definitely must be frustrating and saddening).  My heart goes out to you."

In short, I think it's incoherent to claim you're an environmentalist and dogmatically oppose nuclear energy in the same breath.  So, no.  Thank you.  Source:    EN261 We will cancel construction of new nuclear stations and nuclear power will not be eligible for government subsidy; the Green Party opposes all nuclear power generation and is particularly opposed to the construction of new nuclear power stations, electricity from which is likely to be significantly more expensive per unit supplied than other low-carbon energy sources, and too slow to deploy to meet our pressing energy needs. Cancellation will avoid the costs and dangers of nuclear energy and waste being passed on to future generations long after any benefits have been exhausted.  EN262 Money earmarked for new nuclear plant research, development and construction will be reallocated to energy efficiency measures and renewable energy infrastructure, but sufficient funding for decommissioning redundant power stations, and for research into the safe storage or disposal of existing radioactive waste stockpiles will be retained.   Basically ""We think nuclear energy is too expensive and too hard to clean up, and we don't think we should be doing any research to fix that*"".  This is plainly counterproductive; nuclear has vast benefits as a carbon-free power source, causes fewer deaths per produced energy than any other power source, has extraordinarily low environmental impact compared to fossil fuels, high stability compared to renewable sources, and has visible potential to be cheaper than anything else - and even safer than it is now - with a small amount of targeted research.    But no.  We should stop everything to do with this largely good thing that has caveats - especially not look into how to mitigate or eliminate the caveats?  That has the appearance of dogmatism and cowardice and, if I may say, is shockingly anti-progressive for a supposedly progressive group.  Energy - how we make it, what the impacts of doing so are, and where  we buy its feedstocks from - is the most important question in politics today, reaching into environment, economy, military policy, trade, foreign policy, and societal stability.  I can't tie myself to any group that explicitly states at the outset that they plan to get it harmfully wrong.    * Yes, they want research into storage and disposal, but the way to dispose of transuranic elements it to destroy it in a reactor.  You don't get disposal without nuclear power.  You only get storage.  Frankly, I'd rather our trash do something for us, since doing otherwise is an environmental disaster."

Equality,2pxjhy,Novahill,4,Sun Dec 21 00:34:17 2014 UTC,"The notion that everyone has a stable ""gender identity"" that either ""matches"" their bodies or fails to do so has not been scientifically validated.   In contemporary psychology, normal development is contingent on the establishment of a coherent, universal, stable and unitary ‘core gender identity’. The present study assessed the perception of gender identity in ‘normative’ individuals in Israel using the newly constructed Multi-Gender Identity Questionnaire (Multi-GIQ). The Multi-GIQ includes 32 items assessing gender identity (Feeling like a woman, Feeling like a man, Feeling like both a man and a woman, Feeling like neither), gender dysphoria (Contentment with affirmed gender and the wish to be the ‘other’ gender, Contentment with one’s sexed body) and gender performance (Compliance with gender norms in clothing and language). Of the Men (n = 570) and Women (n = 1585) that participated in the study, over 35% felt to some extent as the ‘other’ gender, as both men and women and/or as neither. Although such feelings were more prevalent and on average stronger in Queers (n = 70), the range of scores for all measures of gender identity was highly similar in Queers and non-Queers. A similar pattern was obtained for measures of gender dysphoria and gender performance."

I honestly find the responses here to be very insulting. My gender is female, I don't care if my sex is male because of my genes or whatever, I will still call myself a woman.  You can't really understand what it's like to be trans unless you feel gender dysphoria. You don't what it's like to hate being seen and treated as a man, to literally hate your body so much and to complete freak out at the idea of a woman using your penis to be penetrated with it. I will never ever use my current genitalia to have sex because that would just be extremely traumatic to me. I could not have penetrative sex even before I understood that I was trans. All I knew was that it scared me like hell and it was not just normal male fear of not performing or whatever typical male sex problem. I didn't understand before why I hated so much seeing people treat women differently than me. I didn't understand why seeing me with a beard would freak me out so much. I didn't understand why I felt so much jealous of women. Now I know.   I was never mentally a man, I was just told that I was one and I have been born with male development so I just lived as a man but it wasn't right for me, it never felt right. I'd rather die than to go back to living as a man.  Btw, one last thing : Even if you feel like you have an androgynous soul or whatever, people are still going to treat you as they perceive you. So if you're a cis male, they are going treat you very differently than if you were a woman. Women will EXPECT YOU to penetrate them vaginally or anally if you have sex. Your life will be a complete different social and sexual experience than if people saw you as a woman. Hormones are very important because they help us trans look like the gender that we are. This way we get treated as the gender that we are rather than as our natal sex. Genital surgery also make us be able to have sex in the way that we feel comfortable with. It's a completely different life experience to live as a man or a woman. You can't just expect people who identity as a certain gender to be able to be content and live happily while being seen and treated as the wrong gender."
Equality,2pxjhy,leviathanxs,1 point,Sun Dec 21 15:38:05 2014 UTC,"I agree with you. I don't think there is a metaphysical essence of a man or a woman that can be ""born into the wrong body"" as a common narrative goes. The brain pretty much works with the impressions it is getting from the senses. Which is why in  people who are blind from birth, the part of the brain normaly used to process visual input is used for other things.  There are some people who experience intense stress over their physical sex though, and/or over the social roles associated with their sex. In the narrative that is prevalent these days, this is because they have a ""gender identity"" that doesn't match their sex. I'm sceptical of this, I think the truth is more complex. I also have never been able to understand what ""gender identity"" actually is. Every time I have asked, I get either ""it's the sense of being a man/woman"", which is so vague it's completely useless, or I get a bunch of sexist stereotypes.  I also find it very strange how this condition is the only condition where the supposed cure is to change the body rather than trying to ease the mind of the person suffering from it. I do think their distress is very real, I just don't agree that it's possible to be ""born in the wrong body"".

I'm baffled that people can feel this way, as a guy I don't think of my ""soul"" being related to any gender, I'm just an awareness inside a body that replicates using sexual organs, those organs shouldn't define my ""soul"" and I'm shocked that theres a vast number of people that feel that way.   I can relate. The thing is that a lot of cisgendered people also feel that way. It was when I started interacting with transgender people that I realized how common male and female gender identity is. That's how I came to realize I do feel an association with androgynous identity, until than I hadn't considered this was anything out of the ordinary.  Technically speaking your soul isn't human either, but you feel an identity in common with humanity. Whatever the soul is a large portion of our mind is rooted in the brain itself and the structure of the brain varies from person to person. Some people are more strongly gendered than others. The amount of gender dysphoria experienced by transgender people varies widely and likewise some cisgender people would be fine in an opposite body and others would be unable to handle it.  There is a spectrum of gender and also a variance in how gendered people are."

To clarify: you were born male, you unfortunately can't become female (develop a female anatomy), but you can develop a feminine form.  'Man' and 'woman' are social constructs; inasmuch as a 'woman' is an 'adult female' or someone who was 'raised as a girl', the radfems will tell you that you're not a woman; but I say that if you present yourself as a woman and are accepted in your community as a woman, then you 'are' a woman for all intents and purposes.  Screw politics.  So unless you're presenting non-binary, I'd say technically you're a 'woman with a male anatomy and a feminine body'.  Not that I want to tell you how to identify, but I've been thinking about this stuff for a few years and I think a lot of our problems would go away if we stopped fighting over these grossly overloaded terms."

To clarify, I'm a biological male, that is male in every single definition of a male, but I want to become a female in the following definitions: gender identification, personality and appearance. I'm aware that my biological nature can't be changed and I can't change the past, but I want to be seen to others as a women or at least a trans-woman.  The thing about this is that I don't call myself a women yet, I don't look like one, I don't act like one, I don't see myself as one and I think that saying that ""I'm a women borne in a men's body"" passes the wrong idea.

I can function as a male perfectly and my self image is male. The thing about it is that I hate this idea that I'm male, (no idea why, maybe that is what you re calling gender identity).   I'm transitioning to a female in order to become a female. I'm not a female yet, the only time I identify as a female is when I'm in a ""female state of mind"" (hard to explain). In my case there are 2 gender identities for me to chose (well sometimes is a choice, sometimes not), the thing is that I hate one and love the other. Gender identity in my experience has a lot to do with state of mind. If for example I'm playing violent competitive video-games and yelling at the screen with a deep voice I just can't identify myself as a female at that point. If I'm playing a calmer video-game that is not competitive, I usually can't picture myself as male.  Most people create assertions based on personal experience and they can't deal with the fact that other people might have different experiences. Just because you can't do something, doesn't mean it is something no one can do. When you say ""I'm female, there's absolutely no way around that for me."", it doesn't prove the conclusion of ""You can't just change your gender identity."". It is evidence that the conclusion couldn't be right, but that is not how logic works. I know you are not trying to make a compelling argument using logic and reason here, and there is nothing wrong with that. I'm just pointing out that there is a jump to a conclusion that is not necessarily true. If you could explain to me why do you believe that conclusion it would be an interesting conversation  Well, this is subjective as fuck, I'm just sharing my personal experience. Maybe that would make me ""bi-gender"" instead of transgender, but that is also subjective as fuck."

I understand some of it may not make sense to some of you (it doesn't seem badly written considering it had me thinking more about the subject than initially anticipated).  Yes, it's a good thing that women have been able to show that they are supposed to be equal just like men. No, it is NOT a good thing that many of the practices engaged by far too radical feminists have affected both men and women so negatively slowly over time. Men being overlooked in education in favour of women is not equality for all and you damn well know it.  Near the end, it basically sums up how men are expected to be a trillion things at once just to appease women by the standards of many radical feminists when that is obviously impossible and this breaks down many men mentally, emotionally and physically to the point where they no longer care to engage in any way, shape or form with women.   A world where men and women can't understand and balance the concepts of friendship, education and sex together is one that eventually breaks down. Simple as that. Like the last sentence of the article says, ""If that happens, it will be women who will suffer.""   Men and women (regardless of their sexuality) will always have the same innermost desires they've always craved (masculinity and feminist feelings are a biological part of ourselves that will NEVER go away no matter how much you, oddly, want them to) which is why we need to stop trying to beat and shame those desires out of them and instead educate ourselves more on them. That is the ONLY way we will succeed in better solving these issues. Education has been the only way we've ever progressed in everything life hands to us and it will always stay that way.   Women (and men) who say they don't want all women/gay people to suffer anymore by blatantly ignoring the REAL concept of equality between both the sexes will still suffer in the end and continue to lose until they start using their heads instead of constantly thinking they're right and everybody else is wrong.

This takes a huge toll on the African American community and is responsible for many of the issues they face like the wealth gap and income inequality.  When I say racial inequality is now a problem, I'm saying that during slavery it was just that: slavery. Of course it was inequality, but that is inherent because of their social and legal status. Racial inequality today is becoming more of a problem because African Americans are full citizens by right of birth. There is no more slavery, but now there is oppression, an oppression that not many people realize and comprehend. While many argue that blacks perpetuate their own existence as a ""second class"", they are kept that way because of the stigma associated with them by many white Americans. For example, if a white man kills a black man in claimed self-defense, most white Americans believe it to be justified until proven otherwise. However, if a black man kills a white man in claimed self-defense, many are quick to say it's just another race related shooting.   I'm saying that it is more of a problem now because they are citizens of America with inalienable rights that are being alienated in a ""legal"" manner."

As I said, feminists aim to give women everything men already have, without giving men any of the things women already have, and without giving women any of the negatives men have.  Egalitarianism to me, is more about leveling the opportunities to everyone. I never see egalitarian blogs/sites etc. Spouting false facts, or heavily one sided arguments like I see feminist ones time and again doing.  For that, I will never call myself a feminist.

They'll delay acknowledging the long list of men's issues as long as they can, and only talk about things like ""men also suffer because of patriarchy!!"" because they desperately need to maintain their core ideology. Egalitarianism is a threat to them because to have true balance you can't start out from a handicap like a victim/oppressor role. You have to acknowlegde both the advantages ánd disadvantages both have, and have to be willing to compromise. Since feminism due to it's core ideologies is incompatibly with egalitarianism, many egalitarian men and women are also anti-feminists."

Feminism might be more about equality now, but in the end, it is still women first.  This is why I dropped feminism in the first place, because I discovered mens rights and realized I had been ignoring one sex for too long.  As it stands now, almost all feminists seem to think that MRA's are a bad group and have a lot of wrong ideas of what they stand for.

Humanist seems to be the label that fits me much more. I have nothing against feminism and egalitarianism though because they're both great movements, like I said earlier. I would still have to learn more about humanism though.  I also read the comments on the article discussing whether someone has to pick either feminist, egalitarian or humanist and no more than two or they could simply choose to identify themselves two or all three of these labels and I couldn't agree more on the latter."
Equality,2m0ojc,bunker_man,2,Wed Nov 12 03:22:09 2014 UTC,"they could simply choose to identify themselves two or all three of these labels   It depends on the context.  Within a discussion about religion I would refer to myself as a humanist.  Within a discussion about gender equality I would refer to myself as a feminist.  If we were specifically talking about different theoretical approaches within that discussion about gender equality, I would refer to myself as someone who supports equity theory.  Humanism and feminism refer to entirely distinct concepts, so it follows that someone could be both a humanist and a feminist.  Within a discussion about gender equality, however, the term ""humanist"" is irrelevant.  Feminism actively disagrees with core concepts of egalitarianism.  Egalitarianism holds that people are equal and should be treated as equals.  Feminism holds that inequality cannot be solved by simply treating people as equals, because this denies and fails to compensate for the disadvantaged positions that many people come from and to treat them equally to those who are advantaged without first addressing their disadvantage only serves to perpetuate the inequality (ie. the bread distribution examples in the article).  As such, it follows that someone who identifies as a feminist could not also identify as an egalitarianist without raising internal contradictions. In the same way, I could not identify as both a socialist and a communist without disagreeing with myself re. the end-goal I'm claiming to support and the process required to accomplish it despite the overall ideals of both movements being the same (increased worker's rights, happiness and equality via public ownership of the means of production)."

I seen that word occasionally when I see discussions about feminism but I never bothered to google it until now and this is what Google said.   Patriarchy is a social system in which: males hold primary power; males predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property; and, in the domain of the family, fathers or father-figures hold authority over women and children.   Knowing the definition of it, I am going to be honest because it feels realistic. Yes, I do feel like patriarchy is real. It's mostly men that holds the power. I guess this is why some feminists are pissed that men mostly hold the power to everything.  Let's use the example of an election. I am going to vote for the next president for America when Obama leaves after his second term. I like the idea of a female president running the country. But overall, I would vote for the person whom I trust to run the country for the next four years regardless of gender or race.  I have a feeling there is an opposite term of patriarchy.

Equality,2lcrri,Zombefan,7,Wed Nov 5 09:52:52 2014 UTC,"As I've said before, all three of those movements have become too broad to truly say that feminism/MRM/egalitarianism is purely one way or another.  IMO, egalitarianism should transcend gender to also look at race, sexuality, religion, etc.  Feminism and MRM have their own sub groups, some of whom are egalitarian, others of whom are decidedly not.  Again, my take on this is that it's mostly okay.  Ideally we would all work together to solve everything, but sometimes we need niche groups to advocate for someone who's been overlooked.  You may completely disagree and I'm 100% okay with that, because egalitarianism to me means giving you the right to hold and express your own unique viewpoint so long as you don't attack me for holding and expressing mine.  What doesn't help is to make blanket statements: ""Anyone who advocates for one gender hates the other gender!""  ""That movement a lie and a scam!""  ""This group I don't like is full of irrational, self-entitled assholes and anyone who says differently has been brainwashed!""  (All arguments I've seen lobbed at both Feminism and the MRM, by the way)  When we do that, we're attacking the movement without refuting its ideas.  Now full disclosure, there are a lot of Feminist concepts that I don't buy into, mostly because they're too Neo-Freudian for my tastes.  You can count the number of men/women in nude scenes to see whether one gender is disproportionately represented, you can even measure levels of arousal when watching those scenes, but you can't support or disprove the ""(fe)male gaze"" being a thing.  Does that mean that the entire movement is wrong?  No.  No more that the Men's Rights Movement is completely wrong for embracing evolutionary determinism.  (I.e. ""Men have evolved to be more x so naturally we're better at role y."")  They may very well both be wrong, but that doesn't mean that women aren't experiencing prejudice in the workplace, or that men aren't struggling to get custody of their kids (though of course I've seen counter arguments to those claims too).  TL;DR Feminism & the Men's Rights Movement are too broad to categorize as egalitarian or otherwise.  Rather than refuting the movements as a whole, I believe we should pick and choose arguments within the movements because ultimately, both can do harm and good."

Feminism = ""the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social and economic equality to men."" (New Oxford American Dictionary)  The issue right now is that ""men's rights"" (not the activism, the rights themselves) are what's used as the barometer for equality; if we were truly to be equal, women stand to gain some things while men stand to lose some things- it is not necessarily women rising up to where men are now, nor is it men sinking down to where women are. It's men and women meeting in a common ground between the two. (The ""rising""/""falling"" metaphors are meant to reflect the opinion that many equalists have of the current social structure, not meant to insult anybody).  That being said, I completely agree with OP. I'm a male. I'm 100% for equality. I'm a feminist.

But I'll still try my best to give you a thoughtful, useful reply.    DIRECTION 1  The whole ""Why is it called 'feminism' if it's about equality?"" question is one that has been asked and answered many times, but is fine to ask as long as the person asking is genuinely looking to learn the answer.  A very short answer is that it started as a particular historical movement that pursued equality for women, and at the time, the ideas they were putting forward were very radical. This new set of beliefs was unique because by design, its normative proposals (conclusions about how things ought to be) for each demographic type are the same without pretending that each demographic type's current circumstances and needs are the same.  The particular historical group that came up with and advocated for this set of beliefs happened to be applying them to argue for basic rights for women, but as you know by now, this certainly doesn't mean that they were implying that they thought women should become more powerful than men or even that the needs of men don't matter. In fact, either statement would be decidedly unfeminist.  So why is it called feminism then if the set of beliefs call for all demographic types to achieve the same outcome? As with every other -ism, the particular historical movement that initially argued for it and the set of beliefs they stood for ended up being called by the same name.    DIRECTION 2  The whole ""It's called 'feminism,' so it must not be about equality!"" assertion is one that has been made and rebutted many times, and is not okay to make.  The problem I'll focus on has to do with academic rigor (and intellectual arrogance, to be frank). Because you don't see how a thing could make sense, does not mean you can declare that it doesn't make sense. With what you've provided, you can only say that it doesn't make sense to you.  Want to be able to say more than that? Great! First, do a literature review. This is where you research what others have already written about it, partly to demonstrate that you're familiar with the subject, and partly so that you can actually provide your assessment of the what you're reviewing. Traditionally, undergraduate students are only required to make it this far.  After you've provided a literature review, you can possibly do a thesis. This is where you add something to the subject's literature. It's no longer your conclusions about what others have written, like you've practiced from elementary school through undergrad. It's new knowledge that you're offering. It will probably still include judgements about prior theories, but what makes it special is that you're establishing a new position for others to review. Traditionally, graduate education is when people start doing this, and even then, they spend several years doing the research to back up a single thesis. It's really, really hard.  Is this way beyond what people typically expect here on the internet? Yes, obviously. But the reason I took it this far was to point out the absurdity of declaring so quickly that something doesn't make sense, especially without even providing any references for what you're making declarations about. You asked to hear opinions, so I can only hope that you meant reasoned ideas instead of unsupported bumper sticker shouts-outs.    So there you go. If you actually take the time to read either of those sections, then I think you'll be pleased.  tl;dr Don't be so quick to think you're the first person to have a thought. Pose questions in a respectful but firmly neutral manner and see what kinds of answers you get. Wait, research, and listen before you adopt a position.  tl;dr tl;dr Slow down there, ace."
Equality,2lcrri,ExpendableOne,2,Wed Nov 5 21:22:49 2014 UTC,"Ok so before you start trying educate people, maybe you should of done a little research yourself my friend. I did basically post the picture...maybe you should go back and look. I posted a link to the picture because I said I was new to reddit and screwed up. I've learned from the errors of my ways and I apologize it made an in convince in your day.   Just because someone didn't go to school to get a piece of paper doesn't mean you can belittle them. I have a done a lot of research on this subject. I already knew it ""WAS"" a historical movement. I'm not stupid.  What I'm confused about now is after reading your novel of a response, and after filtering through the bigotry and arrogance, I really got one answer since I believe the second one was more on telling me on how to do research:  1.) it started as a historical movement.  Ok so because women in the past were treated poorly means that today I get to be treated poorly and it's ok since it was a historical movement?  No. Abolishing slavery was a historical movement, and we pretty much did away with that. Prohibition on Marijuana, nope we are starting to do away with that as well. So I'm pretty sure we could do better now a days then the unequal word feminism and just simply call it equalist, a woman/man who thinks both sex's should be equals. Never get caught up in the past if you want to move forward.  If ""Feminist"" want to call themselves that, thats fine. I just think if you want to get someone's support you first off should not be downgrading the people you want to support you ""#heforshe"". That in itself is asking men to fix the errors of their ways for women. That's not really fair now is it? Asking one sex to change while the other reaps the benefits. If you maybe did ""#heforsheandsheforhe"", then I would have nothing to say because it would be equal. Not saying Emma Watson was men bashing, but I can't say I haven't seen others bash in the name of ""Feminism"".   If you want my support, take it seriously and be committed to equality. Not half ass it and say "" well guys, I don't think we should change the name since it was a historical movement"" by keeping the word ""Feminist"" over ""equality"" it gives women still that little bit of edge over men. So men who support feminism would then have to call themselves a female version of equality. That's fine and all, and some would then even say ""What's wrong with identify with females?"" That's not the point, the point is it's not equal then when obviously they are a male. If you paid any attention in school you might have came across a word problem like such:  Female is to Feminist Male is to_________  But no. The feminist would say, because the word feminist is already covering both sex's.  I'm just trying to figure out why we are fighting over a word.   I just think it's all very stupid. I wasn't asking for a history lesson, which honestly doesn't matter at this point. Things change. That's what the world is all about. I support feminism, well rather the idea...which again I can't  completely identify with since I'm male. Now you if you could provide me with a gender neutral word that I could proudly promote, that wouldn't make either sex feel lesser than the other that would be awesome! That word is ""Equalist"""

It details Reddit's history with trolls and how the admins interpret their roles.   Be sure to follow the links in the main article, as the linked articles are really good also. It's like going down a rabbit hole. This article, on former Reddit user Violentacrez, is especially enlightening.   Follow that up with the Reddit blog response in the wake of the ""fappenning,"" in which admin yishen describes Reddit as ""the government of a new type of community."" And explicitly states that there is no plan to change how Reddit is being run.   My own belief is that if the Reddit admins can draw a line in the sand regarding child pornography, they could also draw one based on the legal definitions of hate speech as codified by the UN. But they won't. These articles help illustrate why not.   Edit: I also think the joke's on them, so far as the name as the sub goes.

Equality,2k6i4m,Pelagine,5,Fri Oct 24 18:36:58 2014 UTC,"I think it's great Reddit doesn't censor hate speech. Free speech needs to be an absolute and ""hate speech"" is well on it's way to being a way to dismiss opposing arguments. People often just accept the labeling and don't even check the facts, since that would involve viewing the supposed hate speech.  The best solution to actual hate speech is to let people see just how stupid these people are and in fact to publicize it widely. They operate by dropping their ""truth"" in small doses much like Scientology, show the whole deal at once ruins their operation.  I mean how many people would know there are actually people supporting Ebola if we clamped down on this kind of stuff? They make their own bad PR."
Equality,2k6i4m,AnarchCassius,3,Fri Oct 24 22:06:58 2014 UTC,"The point of free speech is that opposing ideas are supposed to compete in a marketplace of ideas, where the beliefs which can't be backed up get pushed out.  The reddit admins like to trumpet about reddit being an idealized form of this, where there is a literal marketplace where people can upvote and downvote content.  However, in practice, people can just make their own sub, and thus don't have to share virtual spaces.  As a result, strongly opposed ideas rarely come up against each other and all kinds of hateful things can grow in dank corners, self reinforcing and networking with others who share those hatreds. And the outcome of that is not the triumph of reason over bigotry in a marketplace of ideas.  Rather, the bigotry announces its presence in a way which immediately renders it antagonistic to the very purpose of a subreddit or community, that comment gets modded and/or user banned, and then they go back to their dank circle, reaffirmed that the ""rest of the world"" doesn't see their truth.  Ultimately, in today's connected world, there's so much information and room for expression that you can completely tune out the information which doesn't pertain to your bigotry.  Nobody sees ""how stupid these people are"" until it gains a critical mass and overflows into the real world.  And when it does intersect with others who disagree, you get stuff like GamerGate sending death threats to every gamer who mentions gender on social media and the dregs of Tumblr screaming profanity at anyone who disagrees with them over the smallest minutiae of gender politics.  You get a large enough wave that individuals can't be addressed in any sort of efficient manner.  White supremacists used to be tiny groups of angry men meeting at some local tavern or church.  Now they can reach out and establish networks across the globe.  Perhaps in the long run, decades from now, once contemporary social experiments such as reddit have run their course, a net positive could arise from their ashes.  Ultimately, though, what affects people most is what happens in their immediate surroundings, in their daily lives.  We need to change those things - education, poverty, inequality - before things like reddit will reflect a better society.  TL;DR: reddit is not a democracy of ideas, rather it is an enabler of anything humanity is capable of, good and bad.  It is a collection of disconnected communities, many irredeemably antagonistic to each other, some of which are devoted to (and good at) spreading bigotry and hate."

It seems like most equality movements go through patterns, and eventually reach a point of over-correction. In the beginning, they have valid points. There is genuine inequality, they have a war to fight. But when they finally start to gain ground and make progress, rather than back off of their fight, the groups seem to shrink into a core that doesn't want to give up the war, and instead sees battles where there are none.  The 3 main examples I can see of this are the civil rights movements, feminist movements, and LGBTQ groups. That's not to say these groups don't still have battles to fight, but I've noticed some members of these groups reach a point where they see anyone not in their in-group as the enemy. (Unfortunately this is almost bound to happen, as it's been proven to be part of human nature. Hostility between sports team fans, etc) And become hostile even to people outside their group that are trying to help them.

Equality,2igc77,ThiaTheYounger,1 point,Mon Oct 6 19:10:40 2014 UTC,"That link posits an interesting question.  What I got from it is that rapists, or rather, a subset of rapists, look for passive and/or submissive targets. Evidently certain rapists will go after women who display those markers. Since concealing clothing is a mark of submissive people, concealing clothing may make one a target to a predatory person.  Now, the question this brings up is whether the different types of rapists choose targets on different bases, or whether there is a universal preference for submissive victims. Groth identifies 3 types: Anger, Power, and Sadistic.   ""Power"" rapists, which seek to ""compensate for their underlying feelings of inadequacy and feeds their issues of mastery, control, strength, authority and capability. The intent of the power rapist is to assert their competency. The power rapist relies upon verbal threats, intimidation with a weapon, and only uses the amount of force necessary to subdue the victim.""   Obviously this type prefers a submissive target.   ""Anger"": ""The aim of this rapist is to humiliate, debase, and hurt their victim; they express their contempt for their victim through physical violence and profane language. For these rapists, sex is a weapon to defile and degrade the victim, rape constitutes the ultimate expression of their anger. This rapist considers rape the ultimate offense they can commit against the victim.""   It seems (to me, a complete layperson wrt psychology), that the anger subcatagory would be diffused by submissiveness and inflamed by provocativeness (particularly if they are prompted by some kind of moralizing).   ""Sadistic"": ""For these rapists, there is a sexual association with various concepts, so that aggression and the infliction of pain is eroticized. For this rapist, sexual excitement is associated with the causing of suffering upon his/her victim. The offender finds the intentional maltreatment of his victim intensely gratifying and takes pleasure in the victim's torment, anguish, distress, helplessness, and suffering;[40] the offender finds the victim's struggling an erotic experience.""   Not a clue, can't even begin to get into the mind of these ones...  Also: What about all of the other types? The statutory, the one whose-date-has-had-way-too-much-to-drink?"
Equality,2igc77,gmano,8,Tue Oct 7 06:08:25 2014 UTC,"No one has ever made the argument that dressing sexy ""excused sexual violence"". Ever. No one has ever said ""you dressed like a slut, so it's okay that this guy hit you or raped you"" or ""she was wearing sexy cloths, so that rape doesn't count as rape"". People who perpetuate this myth are seriously misrepresenting the issue, and misrepresenting the people who try to offer basic safety advice to women.  Sexy clothing is designed to stand out, incite some kind of sexual response, attract more attention and convey a certain sense of availability/promiscuity. That means it will gain women more sexual attention/responses, which in turns puts those women at a greater risk.  Telling women that sexy cloths increases their chances of being targeted, or ending up becoming victims as a result of that attention,  is not even close to being the same thing as condoning rape because of clothing.  This notion is insulting to men everywhere."
Equality,2igc77,ExpendableOne,2,Mon Oct 6 17:25:05 2014 UTC,"The problem is that there's no real evidence linking promiscuous clothing to increased risk of rape victimization.  Advising women not to dress provocatively is a bit like advising parents not to vaccinate their kids for fear they'll become autistic: well meaning, but unfounded and probably harmful.  Why harmful?  For one thing, wearing conservative clothing is often seen as evidence of a submissive personality.  Since rape is about opportunity as well as sexual attraction, submissive women are more likely to be victimized than dominant women.  Any benefit you glean from not appearing provocative (and it's not clear there is any benefit) is lost because of perceived submissiveness.  Provocative dress seems to be a non-factor in rape risk, but highly increases the chance that the victim will be blamed for their own victimization.  By continuing to claim that sexy clothing is a risk factor, we perpetuate this cycle, with victims being characterized as irresponsible, naive, or negligent, all because they engage in a behaviour that had no significant effect on their victimization.  That's not to say that there are no risky behaviours, just that dressing sexy isn't one of them.  Frankly, heavy alcohol use is a much greater risk factor on both sides, since it makes both perpetrator and victim less conscious of social cues and reduces the rapist's inhibitions."
Equality,2igc77,Celestaria,1 point,Tue Oct 7 07:37:32 2014 UTC,It's a two fold issue psychologically speaking from my perspective.  *First and foremost nothing excuses rape. This is the internet so I must clarify that.  Provocative clothing does what the name suggests IMO. It arouses the type of feelings/sensations it is designed to. If those feelings are sexual in nature I suspect there is a correlative data point between increased sexual feelings and risky behavior. What's getting lost in the discussion is the hard link people are trying place between provocative clothing and the eventual action the viewer takes. Questionably this is proper when analyzing the chain of events it should be noted that the link isn't direct.

Whilst this is very laudable if there was never any intention to help men why bother mentioning the problems they suffer at all? Or is the idea is that men helping with women's issues will ultimately help men as well? If so it feels a bit like trickle down equality. I would prefer something a little more proactive.  Take for example the what the writer mentioned about genital mutilation of boys in sub-saharan Africa. Maybe once the UN has tackled female circumcision in all it forms people will start to think that we should prevent male genital mutilation like penile sub-incision as well. Or maybe we could just tackle them at the same time.  That's the problem with this. It's like Emma Watson did a lovely speech on banning genital mutilation for both genders then when you finally get to the petition it actually doesn't really care about men, it just wants them to help women.

While the inequalities we face in the Western world are suffered more equally between the sexes, in most countries of the world the majority of those inequalities target women, even if men do also suffer from them to some degree.  While most ""Western"" countries have already accepted as self-evident that men and women should be social equals, many other cultures do not even accept that at a philosophical level, much less a practical one.  In other words, within the context it makes sense for her to speak about inequality as primarily a women's rights issue, especially since she already spent most of the speech discussing how it isn't one-sided.  As a young (33) man in the US, struggling to make ends meet, and having been turned away outright more than once with some variation of ""we don't hire men here"", Watson's bringing up the ""same pay for same work"" line ruffles my feathers a bit - but again, given the context it makes sense.  Time will tell how effective HeForShe will be, but to accuse Watson's intentions of being one-sided on the basis of her speech is unfounded."

Besides, I don't see how men from the first world would be able to help women from the third world aside from donations?   And the only reason it draws in men from the first world is because the genders are more or less equal in the first world already. They can see the benefits of it and yadada. This will not be the case for those in the third world. And claiming to want to help both men and women and then turn around and say you're there for women's rights isn't going to make the men there very motivated to join in. I've said it a lot here, but it's such a basic mistake, it's truly a shame. It could have been great if that had been avoided, but now it's just the Xth women's rights movement."

Hell, even if you do see ""entitlement"" as the root of this scandal, you may still write the article off as overblown and extremist.  That said, I do applaud you for posting some feminist content to this subreddit.  Far too often, it seems like /r/Equality is becoming /r/Antifeminism in disguise.  I realize that there are probably a broad range of allegiances who sub here, from people who believe that feminism really is about equality to those who see feminism as suppressing men's rights, but the number of pro-male articles that get upvoted seem to far exceed the number of pro-female articles that get upvoted.

Equality,2gzm4o,Celestaria,2,Sun Sep 21 04:43:58 2014 UTC,"Interestingly, you are contesting the article.  You are right, but as the very first comment in response, you are contesting the article.  There are many options for feminists to spread more feminist ideals, though, and /r/Equality is designed to be based on equality not on feminism.  At its core -- even the most forgiving definition -- feminism seeks to advance the rights of women.  (Some would say it advances the rights of white women at the expense of the rights of men, minorities, and black women, but I am looking at it from a forgiving perspective.)  Even with this modest viewpoint, though, feminism is not about equality, and articles championing feminism do not belong here in much the same way misogynistic articles do not belong here."
Equality,2gzm4o,freebytes,2,Sun Sep 21 22:07:01 2014 UTC,"You're absolutely right in the first paragraph.  I am contesting the article, not because it's feminist, but because in my view, it's misandrist.  The second does present a problem though.  It's not that we should flood /r/Equality with feminist articles, but that the reception of masculist/men's rights articles tends to be much more favourable than those that address feminist/women's rights issues.  It is good to be skeptical, but if you're more skeptical of feminist articles than you are of masculinist articles (or if you see articles about male rape victims as more egalitarian than those about female DV victims) then you aren't really being egalitarian.  You're supporting men's rights while debunking feminism.  I'm not sure you can be truly egalitarian without reading the arguments made by both sides, which is why I think that feminist and masculinist articles do belong here.  To be truly egalitarian is to give equal weight to both sides, but not everyone aims for ""true egalitarian"" (nor should they).  It's pretty normal for people to be concerned about their own group, because they see and experience all of the problems that affect themselves.  They may be aware that people in other groups have problems too, but their own problems are more immediate since they're dealing with them day in and day out.  They're still good, empathetic people, and they'll help those other groups if they can, but their own group is their immediate concern.  It's one of the major complaints about both the feminist and men's rights movements, and you actually brought it up in your own post when you talked about feminism being mostly concerned with the rights of white women.  The thing is, that if most of the people who frequent a subreddit are concerned with men's rights, there's a tendency towards polarity, such that more and more pro-male articles get posted/discussed while fewer and fewer pro-female articles do.  This creates an imbalance, and egalitarian becomes a euphamism for masculinist.  Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with being a masculinist, but it's not what this subreddit is nominally about.  Hence my comment."
Equality,2gzm4o,Celestaria,0,Sun Sep 21 23:39:53 2014 UTC,"You have swayed my opinion.  You are absolutely right.  After all, equality is simply a midpoint between two extremes, and how can a person ever be expected to post only content that falls directly on the line?  And, as you said, we must be careful not to flood the subreddit with articles of one kind or another.  I am not sure such a balance can be maintained, though.  People like living in echo chambers.  People do not like hearing conflicting opinions, especially if those opinions may change their minds, but it is a noble goal for which to strive nonetheless."
Equality,2gzm4o,freebytes,1 point,Mon Sep 22 03:06:16 2014 UTC,"Feminism is a detriment, even an obstacle, to genuine equality.  For example, when you have leaked pictures of women on the internet, feminism suddenly jumps on this with arguments of ""It's her body, her choice!"", ""It's her rights to bodily integrity!"" or other attempts to brand this off as rape(and then use these distortions and prerogatives to actack and demonize men).  Yet, when men have parts of their bodies/DNA, used against their consent, ""rights to bodily integrity"", ""his body, his choice"" and ""rape culture"" is no longer an argument, and feminists will still actively defend the rights of women.  In feminisms minds, it is a worse crime to leak pictures of women naked than for women to use the sperm of unconsenting men to create a life.  Such a blatant double-standard and it is blatantly anti-egalitarian(despite the fact that feminism literally sells itself on this notion that they are the absolute egalitarian movement)."
Equality,2gzm4o,ExpendableOne,1 point,Tue Oct 7 14:12:49 2014 UTC,"In feminisms minds, it is a worse crime to leak pictures of women naked than for women to use the sperm of unconsenting men to create a life.   If the sexual act was performed without consent, it's rape.  If a woman rapes a man and gets pregnant, then he should absolutely have some sort of legal recourse.  The big issue is getting her tried and found guilty within 9 months of the act itself, but at the very least, the man should be permitted to give up full parental rights.  If the sexual act was performed with consent, you've got a weaker case. It may be your DNA, but it isn't really a part of your body any more.  It's within a fertilized egg within the body of another human being. Superficially, this sounds very similar to rape cases (You should have known that there was a risk!  Why didn't you cover up?) but unlike rape, pregnancy isn't a conscious choice made by either party.  You can both take steps to avoid it, but none of those methods are 100% effective.  She can choose to terminate the pregnancy after fertilization occurs, but she can't tell her body ""Sorry, we don't want a baby right now.  Maybe later.""  If and when we devise a surefire way to prevent pregnancy without rendering one of the individuals infertile, this may indeed be a thing.  Now, obviously there's a grey area between those two sides where one or both partners lie to each other about the risk of impregnation.  Maybe she tells him she's using birth control, maybe he tells her he's had a vasectomy.  In any case, one or both partners believe themselves to be safer than they really are.  That's the sort of thing you have to judge on a case-by-case basis.  There's a big difference between a person who lies about contraception and a person who later finds out their particular brand of contraception was ineffective.  If it can be shown that one partner manipulated the other into having unprotected sex, then again the injured party should be free to give up parental rights, but if they both mislead each other or if one partner made a genuine mistake, then it should be left up to a judge to decide."

A lot of that is because tradition says that guys pursue while women don't (with all the baggage around that).  Also, guys very much are taught to use ""volume strategies"", so I'd be curious as to how many of your messages on the female profile were copy/pasta or ""hey wanna bone"" messages.  But here's how I take that.  I feel as if I could ""let someone have sex on me"" fairly easily -- they'd put their dick in and out of me for a while, they'd get off, and it'd be over.  But I would not, in fact, have had any enjoyable sexual activity.  There would not likely be the things that make sex an enjoyable activity for me.  I am extremely unlikely to cum.  It would not be what I want when I want to ""have sex"".  That, combined with my perception that sex carries more risks for me as a woman, makes me extremely unlikely to pursue casual sex opportunities.  Perhaps different universes between the genders there, perhaps more differences in individuals.  But for that increased number of messages I might get on my profile, I still feel like my opportunity to have minimally enjoyable sex with any of them is exceedingly low."

Just because you got a lot more replies for a fake female dating profile doesn't mean that your test is scientifically accurate. It certainly doesn't mean that the people who responded to or approached you are actually sexually compatible or useful - and this is most often more important to women due to the (usually) more complicated nature of their sexuality.  Also, nothing in your experiment takes into account the perspective of women with regards to safety, which is more important than attractiveness or sexual compatibility.  Men don't generally have to think about safety when seeking sexual partners. Imagine trying to date people that are much stronger than you, who could turn violent or rapist on the very first date and overpower you, use you sexually and then just walk away with very little fear of legal/criminal repercussions, since police tend to not take rape and sexual violence seriously, especially if there's anything like a ""date"" involved.

What if the situation was this:  You have two male employees. Both are good people who work hard. One is straight and very attractive. One is gay and is constantly distracted by his colleague. The straight man is fired because his colleague finds him distracting.  It's not reasonable or fair. If it were, than the colleague who was distracted to the point of being unable to work (which, really, is just pathetic and shows a lack of ability to pay attention to his job in the first place) would have been the one fired.

Yes, equal distribution of resources is an egalitarian practice, but I'd argue that this is only if resources were equal to begin with.

If you are a white applicant who truly believes we live in a meritocracy and that the playing field is already level, you'd feel upset that you'd have an unequal chance of getting into a school compared to a minority applicant.

However, the internet doesn't forget. The internet cannot be wiped clean of them. In fact, I'd say modern people have a greater moral responsibility to not divulge private info due to the new, permanent nature of information.  Once things are out there, it's a permanent piece of information that can be found by anyone. To say that someone should not obtain that piece of information because the originator doesn't want them to, yet it is permanently in the public domain, is thought policing. It's the same logic (with a bit of an appeal for modesty thrown in) that record companies use to ask people not to share music. The changing nature of information causes the morality of the situation to change.   Now then, if you find a person who faps to illicit pictures personally disgusting, that's fine. I'd agree with you somewhat on that.  And finally, I have no idea why it would be considered an equality issue. Something illegal happened, it was wrong regardless of the victim.

Are you feeling an unstoppable need to masturbate when you look at pictures you know people do feel bad about being published? If you eat and your full, you're full. You can chose to put the rest of the food into the fridge for later, or throw it away. Sexual desire is a need we are able to control.

I would say throwing away food is waaaayy more horrible than masturbating to nude pictures of someone who didn't necessarily want you seeing the photos. Shit, over eating is worse still.   Desire is not something we are able to control. We are able to use different methods to quench desire, but desire itself is uncontrollable.

By not masturbating to a certain set of pictures you aren't some sort of hero. You aren't going to win anything and you aren't going to make any one feel better. ""Hey, Jennifer Lawrence, it sucks that those pictures got released, and everyone saw them. Just to let you know I didn't pleasure myself to those images though, so you can rest easy."" That's just silly. Nothing is gained and nothing is lost by not masturbating to these pictures.  Are these people hypocrites? Maybe. But at the same time I want to say no. They didn't take, steal, or distribute the pictures. All that happened was they were presented with an opportunity. An opportunity, which I might add, makes no difference one way or the other on the feelings of any one else, and does not change the fact that these people's privacy was invaded."

In my personal experience, there are two kinds of ""feminists"". The ones who fight for ""equality"", and the ones who fight for ""equality only when it would benefit women"". The latter aren't feminists, in my opinion, and are putting a black mark on the name of a movement that's done so much good so far. The problem is that this latter group is much more vocal and thus the average person sees that as what feminism is.

Aren't many MRAs actually former feminists who rejected that label after some disagreements with how many feminists treat men's issues? If I remember correctly, Warren Farrell got out of feminism because of its opposition to shared parenting.   Personally, I think it was wrong for the MRA movement to reject feminism altogether. Instead of that, they should try to reclaim feminism - there are many different kinds of feminism, some of them even opposed to each other, so an additional kind that's focused more on men's issues and supportive towards shared parenting, male victims of sexism, etc. would be quite useful. It could be a form of equity feminism. It would make it much easier for the whole movement to be more accepted among the general public, since the common definition used to describe feminism is the belief in gender equality (even though some forms of feminism are opposed to it!) so, to many people, opposition to feminism automatically means opposition to gender equality.  I think the situation with feminism and its different forms is quite similar to the situation with Christianity and its different forms. Both of them have their more conservative forms (not in terms of politics, but in terms of strict adherence to established dogma and ideas and not being open towards different views), and both of them can have their more unorthodox forms (such as liberal Christianity and equity feminism, which are more open to exploring different ideas, being inclusive towards more people, etc) Just like unorthodox Christians can reject a lot of established dogma among mainstream Christians while still defining themselves as followers of Christ, MRAs could reject the more exclusive and dogmatic kinds of feminism (that view men as oppressors, deny the existence of sexism against men, fight against the recognition of male victims of domestic violence, etc) while still defining themselves as feminists by the basic ""supporting gender equality"" definition.

If merely using a different name would actually change the world in the ways that our movement hopes, then I'd call it a good deal. So, I'm disappointed with the most common counterargument, which goes something like, ""It's not feminism's fault that people need to learn what the word means!""  Merely changing the word won't resolve the issues that feminism raises because the problems that feminism tries to address overwhelmingly happen in situations where the word 'feminist' is never uttered anyway. To change effects, you must first correctly identify their causes. The word ""feminism"" is not a cause of the problems, so changing it won't have the effects we hope for.  Also, surrendering the term would actually be a huge blow to the movement itself. The reason LGBTQ rights advocates don't just call themselves ""human rights advocates"" is because that identification doesn't actually call attention to any problems. Everybody already thinks of themselves as being for human rights, including homophobic bigots (edit: there are actually philosophical positions that approve of what human rights aim for, but feel that treating them as ""rights"" can unintentionally lead to very bad places... but that's a whole different story!). Likewise, everybody thinks of themselves as being for equality, so ""feminism"" as a term is needed to bring attention to a specific area where equality is not currently met. The confrontation may be uncomfortable, but it is necessary.  That being said, there is nothing stopping you from using multiple labels to identify where a person stands. I am perfectly happy to identify as a feminist, and am also happy to identify as an egalitarian, humanist, and a number of other things that imply or include the values of feminism.  tl;dr I think that taking away the term ""feminism"" would fail to deliver positive effects for our movement, and would likely have negative effects.

What we need is for everyone to acknowledge that some truly dangerous and insane people have infiltrated both sides of the gender rights struggle and they will inevitably do everyone more harm than good.  I think equality and egalitarianism should be pushed, not to replace existing movements, but to keep them honest and create and an actual intersectional movement as opposed to the constant lip service the concept gets.

Generally feminists are good people, who bring up reasonable points with reasonable evidence to give women rights that men have but they don't. There are also a few feminists though, who let other feminists down, the ones who are just plain man haters.  MRA - By definition it means, it my own words - once again, look it up if you really  must - fighting for equality through men and boys' rights.

There are also a few MRAs though, who let other MRAs down, the ones who are just plain women haters.  Do you see where I'm going with this? Both groups are the same just doing it for another gender, like the Breast Cancer organization and the Prostate cancer organization, they both want the same thing and act similarly just work for different parts.

I (and most feminists for that matter) agree that men do also have struggles, there is a lot of pressure on men to act a certain way and conform to certain stereotypes, but when you compare that to the cubic fuckton of shit that women have had to deal with its no wonder they see their issues as more important, the pendulum is invariably currently swung in our favour. If you talk to feminists and talk about what they want you will most likely see that the things they want (getting rid of rape culture, equal pay, etc) a lot of these things will benefit men, the things that objectify and hold back women also hurt men. Feminism is equality for all of us."

I am asking what makes these ads so sexist in the context of today's marketing tropes which rely on making the intended consumer feel superior to others. I am open to understanding why I am not seeing the issue.  Also, I think it is putting the cart before the horse to prepare female Pintrest fans to be outraged before even the first ad has been presented.

There is an atrocious hatred against female gamers in this world that I can not condone from my fellow male gamers, are you seriously so narcissistic that you believe gaming is only for your gender? Do you honestly believe that it’s ok to put down ANYONE for being of the opposite sex and wanting to game equally along side you? Why do men hate female gamers?   Shit... Well there goes that idea of objectivity.   Yes, games are catered to the male gender, why because we make up more than 50% of the market, so the developers are going to make testosterone filled games, that’s just the reality, does it have to be this way, no, will it stay that way, no.   Care to provide some statistics? And what do you classify as ""games""? Or are you just spouting the same tired bullshit that other ignorant people do? Cause the last time I checked, those ""testosterone filled"" games are not the majority of games available. And why are those types of games not suitable for females exactly? Isn't this about equality?   I’d like to see more female pro/antagonists in more games, lead and supports, it’s not hard (in looking at you UBISOFT) Assassins Creed liberation was about a Female protagonist, your seriously telling me it would be to hard to put female playable characters in ‘Unity’? …really.   That's like complaining that a specific painter didn't use enough geometric shapes in his surrealist painting. If you can't like a game simply because there's no female protagonist, then that says more about your/sexist attitude obvious bias, then some falsely perceived bias from the devs.   Back to all the hate, why all the hate to female gamers? What do you (males who do the bashing) get out of this?   Trolls will be trolls. And they will say anything to get someone upset. This isn't a gender specific problem. It's an asshole problem.

Such a common decry, yet it completely ignores the work that goes into creating a character.   Also, most RPG games are first and foremost about the story. Some stories are designed as to where gender is irrelevant (Mass Effect and Fallout for example), whereas others the main character is already fleshed out. Some of these are built from the ground up, but others are based on movies/novels/books/myths (such as Metro and God Of War) and even remakes or continuations of older games (such as Wolfenstein: New Order). In such situations it would be ridiculous to ask for the option of a female protagonist or similar. The story always takes precedence, imo. If you want to complain, go complain to the original creators of those stories.   I find female gamers refreshing, because simply(to me) it’s just right that they can play as hard as we(males) can.

Kind of ironic in this rant for equality that you treat women as completely foreign entities who will play the game entirely differently. In my experience this is not the case at all.    No female gamer should be pained, or should suffer anxiety before putting on a Mic, or picking up a controller, what self respecting male gamer has any right to put down any female gamer in any way? You should welcome them to the game with open palms, not closed fist.   Not sure why the focus is so heavily on ""female gamers"" throughout all this, though. If you've ever played a multiplayer game with voicechat you know that it's not an issue of ""omg a girl"" as much as a general bullying/bitchtalk against ""targets that can't do much back"". There's plenty of guys who get attacked like that, too, but people seem to ignore that or think it's fine somehow.   Food for thought: would you go to a house party that has nothing but dudes?

The entire point of this additional test is to desmontrate that society thinks that violence against men doesn't matter (Warning: TVTropes).   What if a significant portion of the reason that there are so few female villains/lackeys is that society actually gives a damn about things happening to women, they care about women, unlike men.   What if a significant part of the reason that even now plots have male heroes and male villains is that the plot requires violence to be done to the hero and the villain, and that would be abhorent to audiences if they were female?"
Equality,29q3b1,Celestaria,1 point,Thu Jul 3 13:24:11 2014 UTC,"First off, I agree that it's a problem.  What I disagree with is your interpretation.  Basically, you run into the problem of cyclical logic.  Character a's death is tragic because character a is female.  Character a was made female so that her death would be tragic.  And so on, ad infinitum.    You say that women are more valued and are therefore less likely to be the target of violence on screen.  I say that it's more complex than that.  In part, it's that women are less likely to be taken seriously in a physical role: we just don't believe that a woman can go toe-to-toe with a man or that she'd really want to try.  One of the reasons that female-perpetuated violence is ""funny"" is that it's often a result of the female character's ineptness: she accidentally hits a guy in the groin with her handbag and he's temporarily incapacitated but it was unintentional and there's no lasting harm done.  Somehow her inability to control her body is played off as cute rather than pernicious.  Or maybe she does get mad and throws a plate at him: chances are the plate lands woefully short and he's in no real danger.  This time, the violence is played off as an infantile tantrum.  It's not necessarily that women are more valuable.  It's that we expect female characters to act and react like children in any violent confrontations: violent by accident or desperation, not by choice, and woefully unequipped to enforce their position in a real confrontation.  Female characters refrain from violence because they're seen as worthless in combat, not because they are inherently more valuable.  As far as the ""disposable men"" theory goes, you first have to factor in there being fewer female characters in an action movie overall.  The death of a nameless foot soldier isn't as serious as the death of a main character, so when all of your foot soldiers are men, you're going to have a lot of senseless male deaths.  If you only look at the injuries/deaths of named characters, you see a lot of situations where violence towards men is considered senseless or bad, and not all of these are the deaths of a paragon of male heroism.  Obviously these examples contain spoilers.  In the first season of Game of Thrones...  By comparison, this season...  There's a lot of killing and maiming in GoT, but as a rule, violence against victims and non-combatants = bad regardless of the genders involved; violence against an abuser of power = good, regardless of the genders involved.  For an an alternate example, look at the ""victims"" on shows like CSI, Castle, or Criminal Minds.  It doesn't matter whether the victims are male or female because they aren't really characters; they're plot devices.  We watch because we're interested in the recurring characters and intrigued by the mystery, not because we want justice for the corpse who shows up at the start of the episode.  Then, there are the side characters who are killed off to garner sympathy for a main character.  Supernatural dramas are particularly bad for this, with male and female love interests alike being slaughtered to fuel the protagonists' angst.  These victims are usually presented as sympathetic, but not particularly memorable, and the character is usually replaced within a season.  At some point, this became sort of a ramble so I'll curtail myself here before I turn this into a full essay, but TL;DR sympathy has more to do with the victim and aggressor's character dynamics than their genders."
Equality,29q3b1,MuaddibMcFly,2,Fri Jul 4 04:20:05 2014 UTC,"Character a's death is tragic because character a is female. Character a was made female so that her death would be tragic. And so on, ad infinitum.    True.  You're conveniently ignoring the fact that despite the fact that both men and women are sentient human beings, for some reason a man dying is not tragic.  That's the entire point: somehow, for some reason, society doesn't care as much when bad things happen to men.  I mean, seriously, my point was that there is a reason behind most victims of violence being male.  Your explanation as to why that is seems to be ""well, yea, because.""  ...even as you explicitly acknowledged that a woman dying was seen as being more tragic.

Equality,29q3b1,Celestaria,1 point,Sat Jul 5 17:50:03 2014 UTC,"You're conveniently ignoring the fact that despite the fact that both men and women are sentient human beings, for some reason a man dying is not tragic.   I'm not ignoring it.  I'm denying it.  Whether or not a character's death is tragic depends on the character, not their gender.  If the character is written in a sympathetic way, people will feel bad about their death.  If they are written with no redeeming characteristics, people will be apathetic or even glad to see them die.  These reactions will happen regardless of the character's gender, because people are people.  If you have objective data supporting your opinion, I'd be glad to see it, but right now it's literally he-said, she-said.   my point was that there is a reason behind most victims of violence being male. Your explanation as to why that is seems to be ""well, yea, because.""   Well, yeah... because you're partially right.  I agree that most victims are male, but I don't agree with your explanation.  I'm offering counter explanations because of the purely subjective knowledge that I do not feel additional sympathy towards female characters.  Since neither of us have an objective fact to stand on other than ""male deaths outnumber female deaths in tv/movies"", we're stuck arguing about feelings and opinions.   This is completely undermined by your original comment   That's because you're misinterpreting what I wrote.  I started off by paraphrasing your opinion to show why the logic behind it is flawed. I'm not arguing your point, any more than you are arguing mine by citing me.  The death must be tragic because the character is female. The character is female because the death must be tragic. And so on, ad infinitum.  Or, in other words:  A because B, B because A  is circular logic.  It doesn't mean that what you're saying is wrong.  It just means that your argument is vulnerable to alternate explanations, which I offer in the rest of my comment."

Equality,29q3b1,Celestaria,1 point,Mon Jul 7 20:54:56 2014 UTC,"I had a very long post typed up, but I was basically derailing myself by debating all of your interpretations.  Long story short, while these demonstrate that American society shows some pro-female biases, they do not demonstrate that violence towards a female character is objectively worse than violence towards a similar male character, any more than statistics about rape or the sex trade would demonstrate that the objectification of male characters is worse than the objectification of a female character.  Now I'm actually curious as to whether there is any objective study that's been done on this topic specifically.  Edit: Got bored and spent way too long compiling a ""victims list"" for a bunch of CSI episodes, operating under the assumption that if female victims are more compelling, then episodes with a relatively high number/percentage of female victims should be rated differently than those with a majority of male victims.  For what it's worth, there was no significant correlation between gender of victims/perpetrators and IMDB episode rating, though it's very possible that this is due to a lack of statistical power rather than the absence of a trend."
Equality,29q3b1,MuaddibMcFly,2,Tue Jul 8 02:19:51 2014 UTC,"Long story short, while these demonstrate that American society shows some pro-female biases   In other words, there's clear and obvious bias towards accepting unpleasantness happening to men compared to women?    That's what I've been saying this entire time.  This is just a metric to demonstrate that fact, just as the Bechdel test (and Mako Mori) is designed to demonstrate that women are not treated as real persons in their own right in much of popular media.   they do not demonstrate that violence towards a female character is objectively worse than violence towards a similar male character   Of course not, because if you're actually being objective, you must concede that either violence towards any person has an inherent evil to it, or that that the person to whom it's more acceptable to subject to violence is not as meaningfully a person in at least one aspect of personhood.  But since there appears to be a default, objective acceptance of violence towards, helplessness of, and the death of, men in a way there is not about women, what does that say of society and it's attitudes towards men's vs women's personhood?    Regarding your edit: I'm not certain that that's a valid metric.  Does horror/disgust translate to ratings in any meaningful fashion?  To show that, you'd have to compare the levels of horror/disgust within samples first. And there are other confounds: Are the crimes against the victim shown?  To what detail to they show the details of the crimes?  Is it to the same extent for male victims and female victims?"
Equality,29q3b1,Celestaria,1 point,Wed Jul 9 04:06:16 2014 UTC,"You've been trying to tie this into some sweeping social statement and I'm still talking about movies.  The problem with grand social statements is that we're from different countries, each of which hold slightly different ideas about gender, violence, and the intersection thereof.  Violence is highly condemned in my country, even when it's in self defence.  That's not true of all parts of America.  We don't have a draft, we allow female soldiers to serve on the front lines, and we typically don't permit concealed carrying of a weapon.  We don't expect the man of a house to ""stand his ground"" against an intruder, nor we expect vigilantism in times of crisis.  We believe in supporting the victim, rather than escalating a situation through further violence.  You may have assumed that I hold different ideas than I do.  In reality, I simply have different ideas about what's acceptable in real life versus what's acceptable in fiction.  Violence is far more acceptable in a fictional universe because neither the targets nor the aggressors are real.  You're saying that there are more fictional male victims because it's more acceptable to be violent towards men in real life.  As someone who doesn't support violence in real life but accepts violence as a plot device... this is troubling.  It suggests that in order to reach a gender balance where female characters are just as likely to use/suffer violence as male characters, we'd have to make violence towards women more acceptable in real life.  In other words, we can't have more female action heroes until it becomes acceptable to hit women in real life.  As someone who draws a stark paralel between fiction and the real world, this seems like a groundless excuse because to from my perspective it's already unacceptable to hit real men, yet we see men cast as villains, heroes, and lackeys all the time and frequently the social unacceptability of violence is what makes those characters' stories engaging.  Now, a possible alternative is simply cutting out a lot of the meaningless violence in films.  I'm mostly okay with that, but I think we sometimes need violence in film to showcase the senseless waste that is violence in real life.  In terms of stats analysis, I did 2 different set ups: one that was on a per victim basis (gender of victim, gender of perpetrator, type of victimization, etc.) and one on a per-show basis (how many total victims?  How many men vs women?  How many male vs female perps?).  The issue is that the wiki I was using only has about 18 plot synopses that are full enough to provide meaningful data, and I wasn't willing to sit down and watch 15 seasons of CSI for the sake of an internet debate.  Even the meaning of the rating is up for debate since there's no way of knowing whether people prefer episodes that make them feel sympathetic towards the victims, whether they prefer watching ""bad"" victims get killed, or whether they simply prefer neutral victims.  We also know nothing about the people who rated the episodes or whether the same people rated every episode.  It's not a pretty sample, but I worked with what I had.  There actually was a correlation between the gender of the victims and the crimes committed against them.  Women were the only ones to get raped/sexually assaulted in those episodes and the perp was always a man, so they perpetuate the idea that men can't be the victim of sexual crimes.  However, women were also more likely to be the perpetrator of their own crime (e.g. pretending that they'd been kidnapped or injuring themselves and blaming it on a man), so the show also plays into the ""women make false accusations"" stereotype.  Men and women were equally likely to be the victims of violent crime (homicide and assault) but women were more likely to be captured/held at gunpoint.  On the other side of that coin, men were more likely to be the perpetrators of what I labelled ""psychological crimes"" (blackmail, extortion, etc.).  The only other thing I found was that male victims were significantly more likely to have provoked their own victimization (e.g. one male murder vic had been threatening the lives of a large number of people, another was a serial rapist).  Conversely, female perps were more likely to be shown attacking with provocation (One woman was killing her kidnapper, another was killing her rapist).  Trouble is that we have no way of knowing why the writers wrote it that way.  Did they specifically choose to make male victims unlikable because it's easier to do that to men, or did they have to make the male victim dangerous to justify a woman killing a man?  Maybe a female perpetrator makes the man's victimization more shameful?  We also don't know how the audience interpreted it because, again, there was no significant correlation between ""provoked victimization"" and IMDB rating.  There were actually a few correlations between crime committed and IMDB rating.  Episodes with rape and murder were rated highly.  Those that featured assault cases were rated low."

I'll just leave this here   Thanks to feminists, is it legal to rape men in India. Under Indian law, there is no punishing for raping men. Raping a men isn't even considered a crime, because rape laws only protect women.   This is because Indian feminists lobbied to have the laws written to only apply to women. In some cases, the laws were actually made to be gender neutral, but Indian feminists protested at had the laws made to only apply to women.  So, thanks to feminists, rape is legal.  Isn't that an example of defending gender roles?  http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newdelhi/only-men-can-be-booked-for-rape/article1-1021702.aspx  http://www.firstpost.com/india/rape-law-amendment-where-are-the-cases-of-sexual-violence-against-men-384227.html  Mumbai-based women’s rights activist and lawyer Flavia Agnes believes that rather than helping any community, the law will leave the judiciary confused. ""I oppose the proposal to make rape laws gender neutral. There is physicality in the definition of rape, there is use of power and the victim has a stigma attached to her. If made gender-neutral, rape laws will not have the deterrence value and it will make it more complicated for judges in court,"" Agnes told The Times of India.  In other words, raping men should be legal.  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/stoi/Can-a-woman-rape-a-man/articleshow/5733229.cms  To presume that women can rape men is rather outrageous,"" says Agnes. ""While women can sexually harass men, they can't sexually assault them. There have been no such cases anywhere."" In fact, rape is a ""deeply gendered construction"", with several social implications for women such as stigma, she adds.  So a feminist says that women cannot rape men.  So, can a woman ever do the same to a man? Agnes says rape is not just a physical assault, but an expression of power and control by men over women. ""As we do not live in a gender-neutral society, having a gender-neutral rape law will only make the situation worse for women, as many may get accused of rape,"" she says.  Oh my god....notice that line, ""because women may be accused of rape."" What does that mean? It's a problem that rapists are accused? Or wait...she means women may be FALSELY accused??

Equality,27qa5m,Tasonir,5,Tue Jun 10 09:54:30 2014 UTC,"Do women feel unable to get involved in mainstream internet communities and join feminist ones out of necessity, where they are radicalized?   IMO it's unlikely that anyone would become ""radical"" solely because they felt excluded from male-dominated websites.  This might be an issue if the women were also dealing with an abundance of misogyny in real life as well, but why radicalize if the only men who marginalize you are strangers on the internet?  There's no way to even guarantee that the stranger is male.   Why do the[y] feel unable to get involved? How can we fix this?   You're probably not going to like my advice, but... stop assuming that websites like Jezebel are full of ""vitriolic"" or ""radical"" women.  Obviously some articles are going to anger readers more than others, but the vast majority of the comments over there have nothing to do with feminism, let alone radical feminism.  Also, don't go to female-dominated sites with the sole purpose of finding ""vitriolic"" comments and posting them to reddit.  It's one thing to stumble across something ridiculous while reading.  It's quite another to go with the express purpose of showcasing how silly/misandrist those sites are.  Not only are you going to strengthen your own biases; but you can end up creating bad blood between reddit (a male-dominated site) and the women who frequent those sites.  Finally, talk about men's issues!  For the love of whatever deity you pray to, talk about men's issues, but remember how you feel when feminists blame the patriarchy and don't do the same in reverse.  It is very important for men/boys to have a place to voice their issues, but don't lose site of that issue in a debate about why feminists are terrible.   Are 'macho' jokes to blame?   If only it was that easy.  Macho jokes may be a contributing factor, but they're hardly the worst thing out there.  On a side note, in my experience women don't really ""attempt to put the opposite sex on some sort of divine pedestal"".  We're very aware that male sexuality is a thing.  Obviously all women are different, but for me, being the butt of the joke is a far bigger issue than the joke having racy content.   Why are women so rare on subs and forums which are used to find 1 to 1 (clean or dirty) conversation?   Personally, I don't have any interest in one-on-one conversations with an anonymous online stranger, so I don't seek out those sorts of subs.  I prefer this sort environment where many people can give voice to many opinions and conversations evolve effortlessly."
Equality,27qa5m,silverionmox,1 point,Tue Jun 10 02:47:29 2014 UTC,"I didn't mean that places where women don't feel welcome radicalize them but that by virtue of being unwelcome they are more likely to spend time in communities which welcome them but are also quite radical in their views.  I agree completely and am not the kind of person who would do any of those things. I'm sure sites like jezebel aren't entirely radical but I think that makes the suggestion I was making even more likely, they may relate to many articles on the site which makes them more receptive to the radical ideas that are (even if only occasionally) expressed there. I think if we were to work to create an environment where 'men's' topics and 'women's' topics are discussed then that would be good for everyone.  I personally am of the belief that in most gender related issues there is 'the other side of the coin'. Issues that women face often have a male problem associated and vice versa. As such I think we need to discuss these topics in conjunction rather than just saying 'women have X issue' and the men go I agree and 'men have X issue' and women agree."
Equality,27qa5m,silverionmox,3,Tue Jun 10 10:03:12 2014 UTC,"I think you'll have to do a lot more to show that simply joining communities with a heavy slant towards women participants leads to radical feminism.  It may be true in some cases, but I don't think it's as likely as you make it sound.  And if it were, then men would be rapidly radicalizing themselves in the 90% male communities, where you're trying to get more women to go.  Again, I'm not saying this isn't the case - but merely that it isn't as common as you might think.  A lot of those radicalized men (which a lot of reddit has taken to calling neckbeards) are looked down upon by the main community, even if they realize they have a little bit of the same tendencies in themselves.  I don't think it pushes all members towards becoming radical as a goal."

Equality,26xwvg,shouting_pony,9,Sat May 31 07:12:23 2014 UTC,"To me, feminism is a statement of both belief and of priorities.  It's saying you have a belief in equality and that you put a priority on women's issues.  If you think women are worse off in more ways, seeking equality on those issues is the biggest bank for your buck.  You don't have all the time in the world to solve everything, so you have to pick which issues go first.  The draft is effectively dead and I personally don't really care how many push-ups people have to do in gym, but I do really care about people being safe and successful in their jobs.  So to me, the pressing issues are sexual violence (against either gender), employment sexism (by either gender), and women being socialized in ways that hurt their careers.  There are some types of inequality that hit men worse, like custody battles.  I'd like to see less men losing custody in divorce settlements (in court, fathers do fine, but most couples settle).  But that's just lower on my list.  If my highest priorities got solved and the next equality issues on my list weren't mostly about women, I'd call myself something different."

If you're focused on some valid but not (to me) pressing issue between those extremes, then... meh?

So if you were falsely accused of rape, I'd encourage you to see the larger problem and work on that.  On the other hand, if your friend says they were falsely accused, I'd encourage you to be skeptical before rallying to that cause.  How do you know it's a false accusation?

Equality,26xwvg,daelyte,14,Tue Jun 3 02:04:27 2014 UTC,"There are two main movements in feminism: ""Equality Feminism"" and ""Difference Feminism"". The huge majority of feminists belong to the first one.  Most feminist (in my experience) acknowledge the problems that you mentioned and even think that they are feminist issues. Feminism is about the deconstruction of gender roles, even those that might seem to be a ""female privilege"".  I see your point though. It's hard to see why a movement about equality should be called ""feminism"". But after all it's just a name, most feminist are pointing out existing issues and it's important to support that movement. It's still true that women generelly suffer much more under social gender roles than men, and ""male privilege"" is reality right now.  That beeing said I personally think that Feminism is an out-dated term, since we have queer-theory now."
Equality,26xwvg,Legaladesgensheu,5,Sat May 31 08:54:50 2014 UTC,"I've always looked at the name ""feminism"" as promoting the idea that femininity should be equally acceptable to masculinity and have equal influence on the world, but that those terms apply to gender roles, not the specific sexes.  In other words, a woman can choose to be masculine and a man can choose to be feminine.  The idea of feminism is based on the belief that feminine roles are typically treated as inferior regardless of which sex is enacting them.  For example, a stay-at-home dad might be much more likely to be ridiculed for choosing a decidedly ""feminine"" life role, and men are encouraged not to show outward emotion or vulnerability as it is too ""feminine.""  Generally speaking, there has been a tendency in the past to equate femininity with weakness.    I think equality feminism is about putting that role on equal footing with masculine roles, or even about erasing the distinction between the two roles altogether and just having a society of people who are who they are without feeling a need to fit the stereotypes of either men or women.  In that sense, the movement shouldn't be viewed as placing womens' rights above mens', but rather fighting for the rights of both men and women to shed expected gender roles and feel free to assume the roles that have until recently been completely off limits to them.      The reason it is a movement started by women and consisting mostly of women is simply the result of two coincidental factors: first that femininity has been considered the subservient role, and second that women have been forced to take the role of the feminine in the past.  If history had been reversed, we could very well have a movement called masculism consisting mostly of men which would fight to elevate masculinity from a position of inferiority.  And it would include women who feel oppressed in their freedom to take masculine roles."

I would like to add my personal experience is different and I suspect it is because I am old and so I meet old feminists. As far as I can tell, lots of them are at least resentful if not flat out opposed to men.   My mother has run a business for nearly 35 years and in that time she has had dozens of employees but only one male. She uses that one man as a reason to never hire another man. Oddly the numerous useless women didn't make her feel like not hiring another woman.  My sister told me I deserved to be hit by my girlfriends because other women have had a harder time than I have, she doesn't know any of these other women but felt that it was useful to defeat me when I was asking for equal treatment from her.  I was caring for my best friends kids for a year after his wife left him and was told by a feminist principal that I was not allowed on school grounds to pick up Catharine because I was carrying a camera. Keep in mind I was standing in a group of women who were all talking or texting on phones that had cameras. Mine was on my neck with the lens cap on and the camera off.  Yet I was somehow enough of a threat to be banned from doing my job of caring for a child.  These are the feminists in my life and many more like them, the old maternal feminists protecting future generations from the evil men. So much for gender deconstruction.

It doesn't matter one bit if the inventor of the philosophy was honest or not.   There is, however, relative righteousness.   Subjectively, yes. And then we can get into a century-long debate, with no resolution, trying to decide who is the most subjectively relatively righteous.  This, also, does not seem a productive use of time.  If we could guarantee righteous judges, the entire legal system would be ""don't be a bad person"" and we'd figure it out from there. The point of a legal system is so people can be judged by others without the judge needing to be intrinsically more righteous than the person being judged.  There is no righteous. Just thousands upon thousands of forms of unrighteous, all arguing about what ""righteous"" means, most (but not all) striving to become better.  If we abandon the words of the unrighteous, we'll have no words left to make progress towards righteous."

Who is more likely to take leave for taking care of kids? Who is likely to work more overtime? WHo is more likely to work in dangerous and therefore high skilled jobs?

However where the gap exists is in the differences between what men and women ""choose"" to do for a living, how hires and promotions view gender, what parents and teachers and friends tell them they can and can't do, how their behavior is judged in the workplace, and so on.

Basically, this study demonstrated very clearly that men with the exact same qualification as women are seen as more competent, more hirable, more worth mentoring and worth a higher starting salary. This shows that (unconscious) sexism contributes to the income gap. Note that women are just as sexist as men.

Equality,25dh3u,i_fake_it,-1,Tue May 13 09:25:31 2014 UTC,"Hello. So I’m currently taking a woman’s studies class at my University and for the class we have to complete an activism project focused around the issue of feminism, women’s rights, and equality. For my project, I chose to do a blog series on the issue of the pay gap between men and women in the US.   While merely posting the blog is important, I feel the effect of the blog will be greater if more people see it so I decided to post a link to a few relevant subreddits here on reddit. I know it’s technically spam so if the moderators wish to remove this link, I understand but I thought I might as well try and share my blog with an audience that is interested in the topic I’m writing about.   I also recognize that’s not 100% germane to the focus of this subreddit but I figured it might be something that people who browse this subreddit might be fascinated by.   Enjoy. Comment. And any advice on how to improve the blog or insight on a Feminist perspective on the issue is much invited. It’s my first blog."
Equality,25dh3u,radeky,6,Mon May 12 17:27:41 2014 UTC,"So how is it that the average salary for men and women came to differ so much? It’s really not that hard to figure out. Anyone that has studied history in the slightest knows that women have played a subservient role to men in nearly every culture throughout history.    How does having no job = less pay when they do have a job?  You say the 1960s feminist movements made the largest strides, but what about WWII when women started working in factories and taking more jobs.  Why is there a pay gap for people with the same education level and same job, is it really because women have always been ""subservient"" or are there other factors?  Perhaps there are societal factors in what people want most out of their career (random site note: Random side notes are distracting and do nothing to further your point).  You come at the issue with this gung-ho fervor of ""women have been subservient to men, that's wrong and why the pay gap exists"".  When its  a far more complex issue than that.  Personally, I think the thing we don't focus on enough is, when people are negotiating for jobs.. what are they negotiating for?  Men tend to negotiate for higher pay with less time off, less flexible schedules.  Women argue for more flexible schedules, which naturally results in less pay.  So explore those.  As that's an important part of the discussion."

And since I happen to be a white male, I'll even use myself in an unfavorable light to make the point. And I'll use you in a positive light because storytelling.    One day, you and I are about to have a race. Before it starts, my family comes over and breaks your leg. To nobody's surprise, I win the race. As it happens, this is how the race has always been done. My family has a long history of winning the race. We used to break both of your legs, and before that we used to also chain you to the starting line. So at least the disadvantage that my family caused you is not as bad as it was. Sure, the racers from my family have still had to run, but it certainly helps that you've always started at a disadvantage.  Is that fair? Well obviously not. We might have the same amount of talent, but I'll win every time because of the disadvantage you've inherited (which happens to have been caused by my family).  One day, a clever and honest person is made referee. ""Hey, SquareBottle, do you think this is fair?"" they ask me.  ""I didn't do anything, and I didn't ask my family members to do it either,"" is my hasty, predictable response.  The clever judge continues. ""Okay, so then we shouldn't do anything to you, right?""  ""Right. It wouldn't be fair.""  ""Then we are in agreement. It wouldn't be fair to do anything to you since you didn't personally do anything, but TexasRanger1836 is being given an unfair disadvantage. So we won't do anything to you, but we will try to give TexasRanger1836 some advantage to try and compensate for the disadvantage.""  ""WHAT!?"" I shout. ""But that does affect me! TexasRanger1836 didn't do anything to earn that advantage!""  ""SquareBottle, that doesn't make sense,"" replies the referee. ""If the unfair disadvantages suffered by TexasRanger1836 were none of your business, then surely an equal but opposite advantage must also be none of your business. But if we're going to be honest, the fact is that even if you did not cause or even desire your family to heap those disadvantages on TexasRanger1836, you still benefited unfairly, and they still suffered unfairly. It would be better if their legs weren't broken to begin with, but since they are, we need to do something to make up for it so that they can have a fair chance at winning like they were supposed to.""    So in this metaphor, the broken leg stands for all the historical shit that has put minorities at a disadvantage. The way that wealth tends to stay with wealth is something that I benefited from. Having good schools in my community is something I benefited from. Being viewed as confident and authoritative instead of bossy or ""bitchy"" was something I benefited from. Yes, I still worked very hard and overcame a bunch of things, but I was privileged to not have to also spend resources, time, or effort on those other things.  And since the crimes of my ancestors are not mine, why should I hesitate to acknowledge them? Those unfair disadvantages have roots in the actions of my ancestors, but that's not really the point anyway because affirmative action is not a punishment for me. It's a compensation in the name of fairness and equality. for the minorities suffering unfair disadvantages.  And honestly, it still isn't really fair or equal. A few social psychology studies on prejudice should make very short work of any beliefs that prejudice is uncommon or insignificantly harmful. Shooter bias, quality of healthcare, stereotype threat during academic tests, how often landlords lie about apartment availability or inflate the price, the effect of objectification and self-objectification... ugh. Frankly, it's disgusting how widespread and harmful it all is. It's wildly unfair.

Maybe somebody just went through a terrible divorce, and now trembles with anger at the thought of marriage. Does that make him a bad person?"
Equality,24b2gx,Altiondsols,1 point,Mon Jul 28 21:32:33 2014 UTC,"Everyones always talking about womans rights, black rights, LGBT rights, but should someone talk about white/strait/male rights it would be abominable. Fuck that.    That's because the second group of demographic identifiers is the group that already has all of the rights, and phrases like ""white rights"" have, historically, been pretty names for segregation and superiority.   There are good and bad people from every walk of life, not matter what colour, sex, sexuality, religion they may be.    Agreed.   A man could be misoginistic just as a woman could be misandric. A white person ccould be racist against a black person, just as a black person could be racist against an asian. A Christian could discriminate agaisnt a Muslim, just as a Muslim could discriminate against a Jew.   All of these are examples of unjust discrimination, but they're not all the same thing.  Yes, a woman would be wrong to discriminate against men, but it's sort of an empty threat.  Societally, men are in a position of power over women, white people over ethnic/racial minorities (in the US), Christians over religious minorities (again in the US), so when a man discriminates against women, he's contributing to societal oppression.  Yes, both are wrong, but there's an added baggage that goes along with a person in a position of power committing discrimination.   Being against gay marriage doesn't necessarily make you a bad person and being for it doesn't necessarily make you a good person.    No, but condemning gay marriage is morally inferior to supporting it.  Saying that an idea, when espoused, doesn't immediately and solely make a person morally irredeemable despite all other factors isn't really the best defense.   There's more to people than just their political affiliation. There's more to them than the role society has deemed them to be born into. Tell me why I can't say to you what I want (even though it may not agree with your ideas) and why you can say to me what you want (even though it may not agree with my ideas) You want equality? Then learn what it means.   You're free to speak your mind, but you're not necessarily free to use someone else's resources to do it.  If someone bans you from a board for ""saying to [them] what [you] want"", then it's perfectly within that person's right.  Make your own community dedicated to debating whatever topic you please.  I'm sure that, if I went to a subreddit dedicated to requesting prayers for recently passed family members and ""said what I want"" about my views on religion, they would probably be a little upset, so I don't.  The whole world isn't your little debate playground.  There is a proper time, place, and manner in which to challenge a person's views."

Some of it can't, there is a lingering 5 to 10 cents, but saying women make 94 cents to a dollar doesn't have the same shock value.  There are some real interesting observations about this, and some real interesting causes.  For example, when women have entered predominately male fields in the past, it has had the result of driving down the average earnings in that field for both sexes.  This would suggest sexism, but basic economics would argue if the supply of workers suddenly increased, the price paid for those workers would decrease.  What I like about this New Hampshire equal pay act is that it seems to address almost all of the valid reasons why men might be paid more, and allows that exception to continue:   except where such payment is made pursuant to:   (a) A seniority system;  (b) A merit or performance-based system;  (c) A system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production;  (d) Expertise;  (e) Shift differentials;  (f) A demonstrable factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience.  I especially like that it doesn't exempt ""willing to negotiate for more money.""  An area where men have a distinct advantage, since a women asking for more money is looked upon harshly by her boss.  Men have no such handicap."

The blame is actually placed on the things the gender movement - and mostly the women's movement - does to keep men away. It's actually a substantially different perspective. I think it's true to say that collectively, as a culture, we are fairly homophobic. I suspect far more men are charged / sentenced with being gay than women are. And gay-male relationships are far more likely to turn up on telly as negative jokes. Do you not think that, in general terms, intimacy (sexual or otherwise) amongst men is less common than it is amongst women? Thanks for your comments."

It does, but I also see coggser's point. The article acknowledges that the ""gender equality"" movement has created an atmosphere that's almost perfectly hostile toward men, and that discourages men from participating. Great.   The article also says that ""men haven't arrived at the discussion table."" Excuse me, but I arrived there and stayed as long as I could tolerate being demonized and marginalized. When I got sick of it, I found a new discussion table; i.e. feminism isn't the only game in town when it comes to gender rights. The MRM has its own set of problems, but at least it affords me a voice with which to address them!  Maybe the years at that first table have rendered me hypersensitive, but I think there's a significant difference between saying ""men haven't arrived at the discussion table,"" which places the blame externally (arguably on the men themselves), and acknowledging that  ""we here at the discussion table have managed to render the place utterly inhospitable to half of the population.""  [Edit] on rereading, I don't think she dodges the blame completely. It's just that the opening paragraph sets a different tone from bullet point one. But I guess if feminism is her target audience, then it makes sense to ease them into the idea."
Equality,23r5ja,MuaddibMcFly,3,Wed Apr 23 18:04:44 2014 UTC,"I think your edit hits the nail on the head.  If the author started out by pointing out the fact that so much of their ideology is founded on doing to men almost everything that they accuse men of doing to women (or a corresponding evil), they would be dismissed out of hand and ignored.  It's possible the the author is trying to frame things in a way to get around the ""Beliefs first, facts iff they agree with my beliefs"" problem humans overwhelmingly have, by framing the facts in such a way as to mesh with the beliefs of their target audience."

In that it is biconditional, the connective can be likened to the standard material conditional (""only if"", equal to ""if ... then"") combined with its reverse (""if""); hence the name. The result is that the truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the other, i.e., either both statements are true, or both are false. It is controversial whether the connective thus defined is properly rendered by the English ""if and only if"", with its pre-existing meaning. There is nothing to stop one from stipulating that we may read this connective as ""only if and if"", although this may lead to confusion.  In writing, phrases commonly used, with debatable propriety, as alternatives to P ""if and only if"" Q include Q is necessary and sufficient for P, P is equivalent (or materially equivalent) to Q (compare material implication), P precisely if Q, P precisely (or exactly) when Q, P exactly in case Q, and P just in case Q.

I really do; I actually wrote under a gender-neutral name for 15 years, just so that people would take me more seriously.  It can be truly awful being male, and wanting to participate in the conversation.  (Thus, I guess, why I wrote the article). But the article isn't about you or I, or any of the other amazing men (and women) who have participated in the dialog.  By and large, men haven't.  Frankly, I'm tired of seeing men blamed for not turning up, so I wanted to articulate all of the things that are keeping men from turning up.

I would argue that homophobia has something in common with how society looks at rape, in that it is not so much a fear of male-male intimacy, as the article states, but a disgust felt about male sexuality as a whole.  In fact, the author even acknowledges that this is the case, with their 5th point (and, to a lesser extent, 9th); no one would have to ""Affirm, a hundred times over, that a man's interest in sex is perfectly valid and beautiful"" if we weren't currently told, hundreds of times over, that our interest in sex weren't unacceptable and disgusting.    In general, I really like this article.  It feels very much like it's written from the perspective of someone who kind of blames men for not fixing gender problems, and it doesn't really seem to look at any of our problems other than as those problems impact women (especially sexually), but it is also written from someone who is trying to understand our problems.

Humans are sexually driven creatures.  I think America just needs to lose their taboo on sex. A lot of BBC shows have breasts in them and it isn't considered a big deal. In Japan, breasts are shown in comics and they're still considered sexual. There's nothing wrong with people sexualizing certain body parts. As long as you don't disregard a person's being or their accomplishments in favor of their body, there isn't anything wrong with it, I don't think.

Failure to register of article  Selective Service System:       In 1980, men who knew they were required to register and did not do so could face up to five years in jail or a fine up to $50,000 if convicted. The potential fine was later increased to $250,000. Despite these possible penalties, government records indicate that from 1980 through 1986 there were only 20 indictments, of which 19 were instigated in part by self-publicized and self-reported non-registration.  As one of the elements of the offense, the government must prove that a violation of the Military Selective Service Act was knowing and willful. This is almost impossible unless the prospective defendant has publicly stated that he knew he was required to register or report for induction, or unless he has been visited by the FBI, personally served with notice to register or report for induction, and given another chance to comply. The last prosecution for non-registration was in January 1986, after which many believed the government declined to continue enforcing that law when it became apparent that the trials were themselves causing a decline in registration [citation needed].

On the one hand, the subjugation of women is by far the biggest human rights problem on earth, simply because of the numbers.  Putting heavier resources into correcting injustices towards women makes an undeniable amount of sense.   However, the intent is equality and, in my opinion when you try and rally equality behind an exclusionary term, you are going to have a bad time.    Gay rights was supposed to be a similar umbrella movement, we all came together in the 80's and 90's to push for equality, but once there was a certain level of main stream acceptance, many gay rights activists told the trans communities ""Fuck you, I got mine.""   This isn't to say our communities as a whole acted these ways, but it is a very real human way of thinking.  Many, many people who are focused on equality issues are nervous about the ""feminism"" moniker and I believe it really is the same semantic confusion my wife and I went through.  ""Feminism"" proponents think that detractors don't understand the severity of the oppression of women around the world or that they don't understand the history and current intent of the movement.  People who are unnerved by the ""Feminism"" label are usually more spooked by the dismissal of oppressed groups who do not fall under the protection of the term, even if modern feminism assures all that they are just as interested in the rights of others as their own.    To me, it is a problem for another day.  I do not consider myself a feminist in name, the term bothers me because there isn't a need for it to exist and still do the work we are trying to do.  However, modern feminism has done nothing to imply that it is self-serving or is less interested in total equality for all than for women in general.  I hope that we move towards terminology that is more inclusive over time, but it simply isn't harming anyone or any efforts right now.   My advice would be to fight the better fight.  If you have someone you care about and who is passionate about these issues, step back and ask yourself if it is worth putting a wedge between the two of you over this one term."
Equality,225pqj,searchingfortao,4,Fri Apr 4 03:16:54 2014 UTC,"As a man and a feminist, I'm the first person to point out that many of our should-be-allies are constantly shooting us in the back, and it can make any guy feel like ""feminism"" is another word for ""women first"".  The reality however is that feminism is best defined as the fight against patriarchy.  Patriarchy is that cultural pressure that claims that women are less important than men, best suited for ""feminine"" roles like child rearing and nursing.  It also states that men are all angry, dangerous, violent savages incapable of emotional interaction.  The byproduct of patriarchy is that women get the short end of the stick nearly every time.  They're actively discouraged from entering male-dominated fields, and are typically expected to be the one to take time off from their careers to raise children.  Religious teachings are particularly oppressive to women: they're forced to wear restrictive clothing, and are even banned from setting foot on some ""holy"" land.  Conversely, men are oppressed by patriarchy too: we're expected to distance ourselves from our children (and each other) emotionally.  We can't aspire to be nurses or homemakers without being subject to cruel mockery by... well everyone really.  Now here's why we call it ""feminism"" and not ""equalism"" or some such variation: If you go back over those last two paragraphs you'll realise one common thread: men are viewed as the powerful, the women are weak.  We're the ones with All The Things, and the women are the ones expected to make do with what they can get.  Think about what goes through your head when you see a man in a dress.  The man is mocked for ""dressing like a girl"", because being a girl is a step down.  We call it ""feminism"" because it's a fight against a system that actively oppresses women.  We may not get everything we want out of this arrangement, but lets not pretend that we're getting the shorter end of the stick.  We have the most money and the best jobs.  We dominate every organised religion in the world and nearly every seat of political power on the planet.  Any fight against patriarchy is a fight for the rights of women to be equals in the eyes of everyone.  When that happens, the other stuff that the men want, like the right to be a stay at home dad, will be perfectly reasonable, since that sort of thing will no longer be ""women's work""."
Equality,225pqj,cheesus-christt,7,Fri Apr 4 09:14:01 2014 UTC,"So, here's what in your argument I find wrong and problematic. You say the term feminist is biased and unbalanced, which I would agree with IF we were living in an equal society, which unfortunately we most certainly are not. We still live in a completely male-dominated society, where men on average make more money than women, are depicted MUCH more frequently and favorably than women in the media, have way more of a say in politics and social issues, etc. Feminism exists to hopefully eventually even the playing field so true equality can ACTUALLY happen and women and men are being given the same opportunities and being treated similarly in modern American society, but until that happens (which frankly won't be for a while) feminism needs to exist to ensure people's equality and rights."

If you're not, sorry for making assumptions BUT these cases are fairly few and far between. On the other hand, rape and sexual assault are still enormous problems for women everywhere, and a huge number of them, especially on college campuses, go unreported or nothing is done about them due to women being pressured by a society that is run by men.

If you believe in equal rights for all humans, which it looks like you do, you by default are indeed a feminist. It's not a bad word and it doesn't mean you favor women over men.

I think people need to learn that you can't have all the privilege, if you want to improve your privileges to be equal on one side ok you fight for equality, if you try to avoid any improvement for the others on the other hand you are a complete asshole.  Now a more personal point, as a withe male I do not care about feminism, I don't feel like I should involve in this movement, enough people are fighting for it and I don't think that in my country there is a high need of change. I just think there is more important things to change for me, and I feel like feminist in western countries are more fighting for they own little privilege than for equality and it hurt the credibility of the whole movement.  PS: Feminist are not the only to have this kind of reactions, many people only bother fighting for themself, I would say a majority of the population.

Women are payed less in Norway, which is the citadel of gender equality.  Men are depicted as retards in most pop culture.  Men as a group has no more say in politics, because men are not a group, they don't act together. Less women want to be politicians, so less women will be politicians. Choices, choices. No discrimination.  Equal OPPORTUNITIES is fair, and it's almost present (when not, it's in favor of women, like child custody and stripper jobs and some others).

A close friend from college was a soccer player who won the state championships for taekwondo. I was surrounded by football, wrestling, and soccer players for most of my life; and honestly, I was not a very masculine or athletic person myself. Despite your implication that sports matter, no man has ever told me that I'm not a man, nor have I ever felt threatened by a gendered insult. I do not believe my friends have ever felt threatened either. Thanks for femsplaining our experience to us though.  The threats only come when men interact with women. Proxy violence and creep shaming are real threats. Being insulted by women for your career or hobbies is a real threat. I continually observe that men are totally content being beta males until they start having problems with women. Most men don't even care if someone calls them a ""pussy"" for having emotions. It's just a word. What really stings is when a lover says it. That's when they truly realize what the word means.  Just look at Japanese herbivore men. It's no coincidence that they both stopped mating and rejected the male stereotype. Likewise, many gays and lesbians don't conform to gender roles either. Gender roles have absolutely everything to do with mating and raising a family. The argument that men are the primary reinforcers of the masculine role holds no water."

I've never felt threatened in the way you suggested and commented on what I felt was a misrepresentation of men's experiences. You seem to think this is about blame and turned this into a competition. To me, blame is a useless concept. It does not solve problems.  Which brings me to my next point: you felt the need to compare the genders in an oppression Olympics. I don't think either gender rules the world or oppresses the other across the globe. If you ignore the problems of one gender then it will certainly look like inequality. This is why feminists refuse to talk about men's issues or female privilege, intentionally rebranding it as benevolent sexism to silence the experience of men. The entire premise of feminism is blame, which is why the Care Bear types repeatedly say ""it's not your fault"" to men, in an attempt to backpedal out of a failed ideology.  Also, it would benefit you to be less passive aggressive. There's no need to sulk, blame, be ambiguous, or be sarcastic."

That's something that's actually true. To compare the relatively small discrepancy between male vs female in modern young adults to the gigantic one between white and black reveals to anyone trying to actually be honest how different an actual set in stone one sided account versus something that may go a bit more one way, but in individual cases could go either is. That's not to say there's not any problems, but that the historical situations that one sided movements exist for is something its hard to make an argument for in modern day.

Equality,225pqj,NateExMachina,1 point,Fri Apr 4 11:05:23 2014 UTC,"Well, its important to have some historical perspective when talking about this. Obviously the term feminism comes from a time when its absolutely made sense to use. Some people think that its offensive to the historical progression to ignore that that was ever the case. (Likewise, others think its equally as offensive to it to try to still use it at a time when it no longer adequately describes the situation. Especially since the modern people associated with the term bear little resemblance to their historical counterparts.)  The point is that as a term it signified a gigantic one-sided discrepancy. So as time goes on, less and less people use it in the explicit sense due to having different philosophies of how much of a discrepancy remains. And the people who still use it are by their nature those who think that there is still a larger one, which unfortunately means that as this progression happens, it will go from an ""everyone"" movement, to a kind of fringe one with extreme ideas. Some people think we already passed that time; others think that while those people exist, that the other ones still have a useful goal to perform.  However, the nature of feminism is kind of a more extreme version of the nature of humanism. Its a word that came into existence during a time when it seemed bizarre and new to most people. But in modern day, almost everyone in the west would profess to comply with its basic standards. So its something that to actively wave around is not a declaration of what the self is, but rather an accusation that other people are not one. So someone actively identifying as such, and rallying around a term that this has already happened to almost inevitably comes with the unfortunate reality that they are going to project their own specific ideology onto it that they assume any ""real"" one would have. They will alternate between demanding others see the term as its classical usage but them also using it to essentially project specific ideological goals that more or less they are trying to not actually have to justify. This is something that most people are familiar with already. The question is whether the amount that happens is low enough that the benefit from the term feminism as opposed to a more generally named thing is still a net positive. Most of society thinks we moved past that time. (even though they will admit that issues still exist obviously.) The amount of people who openly identify as feminist is something like 1/3d or 2/5ths the amount that did a few decades ago. (Keep in mind also, that someone saying they're something doesn't actually make their actual qualities any better, if one were to go to the question of whether everyone else sufficiently qualifies.)  On the personal level I think its more that its redundant to say. It comes off as pretentious, or arrogant to explicitly identify as a term that most people theoretically qualify with some version of, as if there was another option for anyone not explicitly a radical sexist. It would be better to just actually state what one thinks relating to anything at hand. One could technically point out that they technically qualify if anyone wanted to know, but that is wildly separate from the stigma associated with the postmodern usage. Words exist in social contexts, so people can't handwave the negatives of whatever they take on. They have to think of the full context and act accordingly."

Feminism is focus on patriarchal oppression and egalitarianism is about equality of all people. So technically feminism is part of egalitarianism.  However, feminism is jeopardizing itself by overlooking men issues. If you acknowledge that men have most of the power then you should focus on changing them - even if it's good to help the victim, it's not going to change the criminal.  As semantic goes, one can't just chose to believe the book that had the definition that suite their view. That's why we need and have a authority on what words mean; it's called the dictionary.

Civil rights include the ensuring of peoples' physical and mental integrity, life and safety; protection from discrimination on grounds such as race, gender, national origin, colour, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or disability;    and individual rights such as privacy, the freedoms of thought and conscience, speech and expression, religion, the press, assembly and movement.  Political rights include natural justice (procedural fairness) in law, such as the rights of the accused, including the right to a fair trial; due process; the right to seek redress or a legal remedy; and rights of participation in civil society and politics such as freedom of association, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right of self-defense, and the right to vote.  Civil and political rights form the original and main part of international human rights.  They comprise the first portion of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (with economic, social and cultural rights comprising the second portion). The theory of three generations of human rights considers this group of rights to be ""first-generation rights"", and the theory of negative and positive rights considers them to be generally negative rights.  The phrase ""civil rights"" is a translation of Latin ius civis (rights of a citizen). Roman citizens could be either free (libertas) or servile (servitus), but they all had rights in law.  After the Edict of the Milan in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion.  Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on religious doctrine. According to the leaders of Kett's Rebellion (1549), ""all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious blood-shedding.""   In the 17th century, English common law judge Sir Edward Coke revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed such rights. The English Bill of Rights was adopted in 1689. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, by George Mason and James Madison, was adopted in 1776. The Virginia declaration is the direct ancestor and model for the U.S. Bill of Rights (1789).  In early 19th century Britain, the phrase ""civil rights"" most commonly referred to the problem of legal discrimination against Catholics. In the House of Commons support for the British civil rights movement was divided, many more largely known politicians supported the discrimination towards Catholics. Independent MPs (such as Lewis Eves and Matthew Mountford) applied pressure on the larger parties to pass the civil rights act of the 1920s.  In the 1860s, Americans adapted this usage to newly freed blacks. Congress enacted civil rights acts in 1866, 1871, 1875, 1957, 1960, 1964, 1968, and 1991.

The report itself (http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2013/) is interesting, but this part is frustrating as an egalitarian:   the Index rewards countries that reach the point where outcomes for women equal those for men, but it neither rewards nor penalizes cases in which women are outperforming men in particular indicators   So if men are ahead in a metric, it's sexism and gender inequality, but if women are ahead in a metric, it doesn't count as sexism or gender inequality in these rankings?...  This means the report completely ignores any imbalance or sexism towards the male half of the planet. Males in many first world countries lag behind in life expectancy, health, homelessness, and higher education. Yet none of this counts for these ""gender gap"" rankings.  It's especially disappointing considering right before that part the report states:   Gender equality vs. women’s empowerment  The third distinguishing feature of the Global Gender Gap Index is that it ranks countries according to their proximity to gender equality rather than to women’s empowerment. Our aim is to focus on whether the gap between women and men in the chosen indicators has declined, rather than whether women are “winning” the “battle of the sexes”.    Which is excellent and just the kind of egalitarianism I want to see more of in studies like these. Pretty silly that they immediately do the opposite in the next sentence.  edit:  Elsewhere in the report they explicitly state that they chose the scale which doesn't give higher score for ""absolute equality"":   The type of scale chosen determines whether the Index is rewarding women’s empowerment or gender equality. To capture gender equality, two possible scales were considered. One was a negative-positive scale capturing the size and direction of the gender gap. This scale penalizes either men’s advantage over women or women’s advantage over men, and gives the highest points to absolute equality. The second choice was a one-sided scale that measures how close women are to reaching parity with men but does not reward or penalize countries for having a gender gap in the other direction. Thus, it does not reward countries for having exceeded the parity benchmark. We find the one-sided scale more appropriate for our purposes.   ""it does not reward countries for having exceeded the parity benchmark."" Are you serious? Metrics where men are worse off than women are ""exceeding parity""? No, sorry, that's called gender inequality and a report on gender inequality should not be ignoring it."

On the matter of maternity, she pointed out that Qatar’s Civil Aviation Authority has medical restrictions on flying while pregnant.   It's definitely super fucked up, but it seems like the company itself isn't necessarily where people should focus their ire, but instead on Qatar's backwards government.

If you must fly frequently during your pregnancy, discuss it with your health care provider. He or she might limit your total flight time during pregnancy.    So, yes.  Apart from that even non-frequent fliers should avoid flying any time even close to when they could go into labor.

Point is, you probably won't change how they think, and if you send a letter to the dean, you'll waste your time. There won't be enough ruckus to change something.  What you can do is what I do. I distance myself from those people, not laughing at their jokes and not hiding how bothered I am.

Equality,1z33de,Bascome,-4,Fri Feb 28 14:17:03 2014 UTC,"I am not following exactly, perhaps you can help me out and explain something. It seems to me you agree that there are not a lot of women in your classes. So why is it sexist to point out that fact again? You seem to have pointed it out yourself, are you being sexist? Is the sexist part where males admit looking at an attractive female would be nice?   I have to admit I like looking at attractive females, is it sexist to think it or just sexist to admit it in public, or just sexist at a school. I am a bit confused.  Do you not like looking at attractive men or women?  I am also not sure how saying watch out for transgender people if you are not transgender is sexist either. I appreciate when my gay friends inform me that we are going to a gay bar instead of a straight one, I also like it when they point out interest in me from a gay man. I have virtually no radar for that so it helps me be sensitive to a reality I usually totally miss.   Overall you seem to be upset at sex or any mention of it in public. This is not the same thing as sexism imo."
Equality,1z33de,Bascome,9,Thu Feb 27 17:12:06 2014 UTC,"I think the point the OP is trying to make is that her teachers/classmates refer to girls as something ""nice to look at"" but nothing else. Pointing out that there are almost no girls in a class is not sexist, but doing so in a way that suggests that girls aren't good enough and/or simply cannot be in that class, is sexist. Going by what the OP has written, this is the way in which her teachers/classmates seem to refer to girls (or the lack of).  Also, saying that the only girls who were there don't count ""because they were ugly"" is quite sexist imo, and it brings me back to my first point: these people seem to consider girls as paintings on a wall: they're nice to look at, but they don't do much else. This what I understand from the comment, but I might not be entirely right, as I am not familiar with the OP's situation."
Equality,1z33de,N3dr4,-10,Thu Feb 27 18:12:07 2014 UTC,"The comment about doing chores in a college class just sounds wrong to me. It sounds like this message is being washed a bit before it gets to us. I have never had to clean up after class have you ever had to clean under your chair or do some windows during a lecture. In Labs we all cleaned after ourselves.  I agree we need more information to be sure one way or another but the op is certainly trying to make it sound sexist.  I would offer that saying a woman is ugly is not sexist it is rude. Even desiring more attractive females in class is not sexist it is shallow. Stating that women are only good to look at is most certainly sexist. I didn't see that claim being made clearly by the OP.  How do you personally feel about being objectified sexually as long as it is not the only opinion being held? I love it when my gf treats me as a sex object personally and I know for a fact she loves it when I treat her the same. We also know we can build a deck or renovate a house or do sports or have a long talk on economics or the stock market or medical care for her mom. Objectification of women and men is fantastic as long as it does not lessen the person being objectified, only then does it become offensive."
Equality,1z33de,Bascome,6,Thu Feb 27 18:24:45 2014 UTC,"I have had to clean up after class on many occasions, especially after physics and chem labs, but for other classes as well. If the student who proposed to have a girl in the class did so only because he wanted her to ""do chores"" then that is sexist. Remember that this comes from someone who seemingly doesn't believe in a girl's capability to be in engineering (then again, since I do not the situation nor the person, I cannot be sure of this).   I would offer that saying a woman is ugly is not sexist it is rude.   True. But look at the context in which this was said: someone mentions there were girls in the class before, and a student replies that they don't count because they were ugly. Now this is downright objectifying, because going from this person's POV, a girl isn't really a girl unless she's pretty; she really just counts if she's eye candy for him. This is also clear in how it is mentioned that ""relaxing the eyes"" is one of the uses (yes, 'uses') a girl would have in class.   Nothing wrong with being sexually objectified consensually by people with whom we are intimate, but that isn't the case here. You talk about your girlfriend and how she enjoys objectification with you, but the situation is entirely different when in a formal context, with strangers or people who are not close to us and who do not know us. Because they do not know us (or know us little), it is hard to conceive that another opinion can be held.   I find the comments offensive, personally. Of course, it's not the end of the world, and I wouldn't be furious, but offended, yes. Especially if these had a tendency to repeat themselves, I can guanrantee, it can become tiresome. It can also be made worse when you are the only person to whom this is offensive, which makes it much harder to react."

I was told it was not possible to sexually harass a man and that I was a faggot if I didn't fuck her.

You can't talk about the good side of having a girl in class if you reduce her to be eye candy and a maid.   I don't think it's sexist to admit you like looking at attractive females, I think it's just redundant, people enjoy looking at beautiful people. The sexist part is making rude comments in public, following her with your eyes and body like you're a tiger hunting a zebra or cat whistling is.  Making a joke about transgender people and basically stating that those girls aren't exactly girls reduces the definition of gender to what's between your legs, this is especially true considering Carnaval is high tide for sexual contact.  I completely understand your POV, that's the main reason that these people aren't exactly abusive, these comments aren't as abusive as people notice, they are comments that pass as normal, comments we would see on TV because they are comments based on sexism that is innate to society -my society in special, Brazilians are famous for the whole suave latino sexism.  All I can learn from my OP is that there are things that won't be changed in my lifetime. These comments are seen and perceived as normal by most people.

First I would say that I do not understand in what the comment about the carnival can be sexist, this is a real problem he is kindly joking about it because if he was serious about it people in the class would not acknowledge it. This is oftenly used by teachers to teach things that are for out of the class, you make it a little joke and so people at the end would remember it because it was the only moment when they where not bored .  Then I feel you position yourself as a victim. Once again, people in engineer school make shitty jokes, 9/10 they don't think a word of what they say. I went there and I can tell you in our group of friend we were from different places (portugese, east of france, asia, africa) and we were making racist jokes about it all the time, if you were listening to use you would think we were a bunch of racist guys.  Now omen in theses classes are more bro than women because you see them everyday they dress casually and it is not what men search at this moment, so sometime men forgot that you don't understand shitty men jokes that can sound really sexist yes.  Now if you want to act against this, you know you can answer to theses people that say there is no women in class or that they should do the chores, just find a smart answer/joke. I don't know I don't know you kind of humour etc but I think you should try first to see if it is really sexism of just crappy jokes"
Equality,1z33de,TioTaba,1 point,Fri Feb 28 09:10:01 2014 UTC,"I have recently started asking all women I know if they mind being objectified as long as they are not only objectified. So far I have yet to find a single woman who minds being a sex object as long as she is not only a sex object.   The problem I have found is not in the objectification it lies in the reduction of a person to only that thing.  As a result personally I have no issue at all with limited objectification, as long as the nature of that objectification is not limiting of the individual.   I have an issue with the maid part, what college or university has students doing chores in a class they paid for? This seems like a bit reaching so I am not commenting on that part at all. If true is it still sexist if only the boys do the chores currently and they are complaining for more equitable treatment. I would need more information to have any opinion worth anything on that issue. It certainly sounds like if it is happening there would be a huge issue in class from the other women present. Personally I know very few women who would take a comment like that in stride.   I am still unsure if we are talking about sexism or just assholes."

Equality,1z132p,wooq,6,Thu Feb 27 01:22:28 2014 UTC,"Do I disagree with your guess based on incomplete information?  I don't know if I do or not, because I haven't made a similar guess.  Here's a thing that says historically there's a 70-30 split (trending downward) between male-female applicants for a prestigious screenwriting fellowship.  So if 30 percent of applicants for a fellowship are female screenwriters, but only 9 percent of scripts sold are written by females, there's a bit of a disparity.  So with a bit more information, I guess, yes, I do disagree.  Though again it's only a tiny point of data informing that guess."
Equality,1z132p,wooq,4,Thu Feb 27 04:36:56 2014 UTC,"The key word here is ""SOLD"".  If you are talking about TV (which is what you'd be going for if you wrote a spec script, usually), you are facing producer and network exec numbers too.  Those also need to be addressed, though the producer numbers, at least in television, are intrinsically linked with writer stats.  (Most TV producers come up through the ranks in the Writers' Room and many simultaneously write and produce for the show they are working on.)  I think if you address the number of female writers on staff and on the network executive track, you will, in short order, see a dramatic increase in both the number and quality of roles for women."
Equality,1z132p,quigonjen,1 point,Thu Feb 27 04:55:13 2014 UTC,"I don't think that women aren't writers.  The numbers cited are addressing the number of scripts that are SOLD.  If you are dealing with an industry bias, the sales are not representative of the number of scripts submitted or the number of writers who went out for a staffing season.  I can only hazard a guess, but I think that the numbers would be a little higher.  Not much, which is a problem, but a bit.  But I agree with you--there need to be more ways into the Writer's Room for women.  Organizations like Women in Film are phenomenal.  Women need to be hired as Writer's Assistants (traditionally the first rung on the Writer's Room ladder, and essential to moving up to Story Producer, etc.) and staffed as Writer/Producers.  It also would help to have more female showrunners.   I also stand by my assertion that more women need to be in Network Development and Executive roles--eventually, these people have the final say about what will and won't go on TV.  If you put women in these jobs, they are more likely to air content with more balanced female roles, which will also encourage more women to write for said content--there's an element of symbiosis at play."

I think it is due to society, movies are made of action, anytype of action but something has to happend in it (if not it is french movies and nobody goes to see them) until recently the society was about men. And as all the old and rich companies, movie company have a hard time to change. They are still old style.  On the other hand, movies that earn the most are action based movies involving shooting/fighting and even nowaday there is no 50/50 in the army so if they want to be a little bit realistic you can't have 50/50. I find the 28.4% extremly low but when you really check some top movies .. the  avengers ... Django ...

Either way, the point is that things which can easily have huge unintended effects cannot be summed up as ""My principles say this should not be a big deal."" IF it turns out it's fine, it's not because of an abstract rule in the universe about how the fact that it seemingly should be allowed means that therefore there's no consequence.

But I think selling sex is not necessarily any more harmful than giving it away, and so it's rather different than those items you mentioned.  In particular, I think sex workers would flourish within an environment where sex work was steadily established in its legality, and where sex workers were prone to collectivize to reduce risks-- the overall net effect would be one of much less harm than occurs with sex work prohibition-- and quite likely, a quality of life (if not also reputation) boost to those involved in the trade.  Surely, you can see how certain cultural values found among those not participating in the sex trade can bring much misfortune to bear upon sex workers and johns, misfortunes that would otherwise never exist.  Every STD problem that a sex worker may have also exists among swingers, yet swinging is permitted.  Every drug use problem that a sex worker may have also exists among those in other professions, yet those other professions are permitted.

Legalization and collectivization, sans pimps, is the only way (that I can see) that the sex work business can even begin to be optimally improved.

In modern Western philosophy, sentience is the ability to experience sensations (known in philosophy of mind as ""qualia""). For Eastern philosophy, sentience is a metaphysical quality of all things that requires respect and care.

They were little plastic bricks that you could build stuff out of. It never mattered who was building what with them, and frankly, it still doesn't.  I guess the point is that if you assume that they're wrong for making ""girly"" LEGO sets, it implies that all of the other LEGO sets are ""boy"" sets, and that's just plain untrue.  They're just sets. They're just little plastic blocks.  The problem isn't LEGO, the problem is that a lot of parents still seem to believe that building things with blocks ""isn't for girls"". That's not LEGO's fault, that's the fault of every parent that allows their child to be brainwashed into thinking ""it's not for girls"" instead of encouraging their child to be free to play with whatever toys they want.  I'd never refuse to buy my son what would traditionally be viewed as a ""girl's toy"" if that's what he wanted to play with, but a lot of parents would, and so to appeal to the 50% of their target age demographic, LEGO makes toys marketed to girls based on the common perception of the parents.

Equality,1y36q6,Pelagine,1 point,Mon Feb 17 05:59:48 2014 UTC,"To me, the author seems to be applying his own preconceived notions of gender inequality to a children's toy. I personally don't see anything inherently wrong with girls and boys gravitating to different types of toys. If these differences are the result of ""unnatural forces"" I am more inclined to believe what other people in this thread have brought up; parents are the ones influencing what their kids play with, and steer girls away from Legos to more traditionally ""girly"" toys. Saying that Lego is the one driving gender imbalance is such a tail wagging the dog scenario.  with regards to the author saying this:   The girls in my son’s first-grade class? Only the tomboys play Lego—all the rest “used to.”   I think it's completely reasonable to wonder that what the author is seeing is a completely organic process of girls and boys forming their own identities that are reflected in the toys they want to play with.  Similarly, I find his accusation that gender imbalance is ""awful"" in the STEM industry a little problematic. If we were accept that women's career choices are increasingly free and unhindered by discrimination (a position i'm pretty comfortable taking), yet the entrance of women into the STEM industry has largely plateaued over the past 20 years, maybe it's just the result of the ""average"" woman just not being all that interested in engineering and/or computer science (80% of total STEM workforce).  I don't deny one bit that institutional gender discrimination has and does exist, but i also am 100% certain that it has improved astronomically from just 40 years ago. If that's the case then maybe the imbalances still present between gender are increasingly the result of free and rational choices, and not systemic discrimination."

That's literally what the word means (trans + vestitus).  There does not need to be a sexual component for transvestism.  As I have expressed, I am fully supportive of your desire to wear women's clothing, for whatever reason.  If anything, your denial is perpetuating the problem.  There's no shame in transvestism."

I want to be able to dress formally on a hot day and still be more comfortable.  Just because ""uncomfortable"" isn't as bad as ""possible death"", that doesn't invalidate it as an existing problem.  Problems can exist that aren't the worst problem ever conceived.   Transvestism = wearing the clothing of the opposite gender.   First off, ""transvestite"" has a negative connotation now.  If you were more familiar with the community, you'd know that ""cross-dresser"" is the preferred terminology these days.    Secondly, when I am wearing a skirt, it was bought by a man, for a man, and worn by a man.  That makes it, by definition, a man's skirt.  Ergo, it's not women's clothing at all.  Heck, I even own skirts that I, myself, sewed.  I am not wearing clothing of the opposite sex, I am wearing a skirt.  Thank you, though, for any support you offer."

I was reading through their 2003 policy document regarding same-sex students and here's what they laid out:  Who you feel desire for is not a choice, but who you engage with romantically is. For Catholics, this is where the conversation begins. Sex is intended for two married people, and the marriage is valid in the eyes of god when it is a covenant between a man and a woman. Any romantic behaviour must fall on the path from courting to marriage for it to be acceptable and not sinful. Since any romantic behaviour between homosexual individuals cannot lead to marriage as recognized by god, then it is an act of sin. So their view is that there is nothing wrong with being gay, as long as you live a life of chastity.   This is not my view, just reporting on what I read.  You're seeing the issue as a born this way / chose this identity conflict, but it's really all about the religious definition of marriage as between a man and a woman, combined with the idea that any romantic or sexual behaviour is wrong outside the context of marriage.  If you're interested in the document, here's the pdf:  http://acbo.on.ca/englishdocs/Pastoral%20Guidelines.pdf  (The good news is that we implemented Bill 13 to override this even in Catholic schools, and ensure that they allow things like a gay-straight alliance, etc. The bad news is that we still pay for religious education with tax dollars.)"

One might argue God creates handicapped people and they are at a disadvantage but the disadvantage does not come from us. We do not disparage them , in fact we do everything we can to make life easier for them and accept them as God's creatures. I see homosexuality the same way, they might be different than most other people but they are no less important or special or deserving in Gods eyes and shouldn't be in anyone else's either. By choosing to believe the man-written bible you are basically admitting the God you believe in intentionally creates people that will suffer at the hands of others who follow his message.

Equality,1x6324,barsoap,4,Thu Feb 6 18:02:09 2014 UTC,"The evolutionary -- and military -- reason for military being primarily men's business is men's expandability: The prime doctrine is protecting the existence of the tribe, and men dying doesn't hit the tribe as much as women dying. For the exact reason that ten women and one man can produce ten kids in nine months, it doesn't work the other way round.  That, OTOH, doesn't necessarily apply in the same black and white way to a modern people of millions than it does to a stone-age band of a hundred, on top of that, especially regarding Germanic tribes, women always also played a military role. Everyone did. The old motto of ""Better dead than a slave"" involved first the men fighting and dying, then the women, then the kids and elderly, until noone was left. It's a rather effective way to dissuade other tribes from raiding you and selling you as slaves to the Romans, the risk is just too high, all for spoils of possibly a couple of babies, which weren't worth a lot on the market.  Then there's the fact that militarily speaking, female biotruths also have their perks. While lacking in raw strength you get generally better coordination, which also translates to reaction speed, and often superior mental resilience. Then there's psychological and sociological reasons why mixed groups are superior.  So, yes, of course woman do fit into the military. Why wouldn't they, they're no less the most dangerous predator on earth than men."
Equality,1x6324,evilpoptart,1 point,Thu Feb 6 11:17:46 2014 UTC,"Those last two paragraphs are not entirely correct.  Western culture has trained men to protect women at all costs, so having mixed units can seriously compromise command and control within a squad as men fight their cultural urge to protect women in order to put the welfare of the entire group as first priority.  Then there is the issue of training requirements that are lowered to accommodate female soldiers.  There are ~3 main ways this can play out: First, women are simply not trained as rigorously as men which can lead to resentment by the men for getting the same pay and advancements for more work.  Second, they can all be trained at the same lower level which will lead to more combat deaths because the soldiers are not as well trained as they could be.  Third the standards can be put at the top level and almost all the women will not be able to hack it, which is political Cryptonite for the military these days.  And as for women having better coordination, that is simply not true.  We've been selecting men for hunting and fighting for many thousands of years, not women and recent studies show that men are better at those specific tasks.  Along the same lines is the fact that the male frame is stronger for many physiological reasons such as bone and muscle structure.  If you don't believe that, find me the strongest man and strongest woman in the world and have them compete in strength contests; it will be a blowout.  That's why sports are divided by sex because no one wants to see a 250 pound woman get absolutely crushed by a 400 pound male linebacker or have Usain Bolt regularly beat every female comer at the Olympics.  Furthermore there is the fact that men are hardwired to enjoy fighting to a much greater extent than women.  You need only look at how many first person shooter games (or really any war games for that matter) that are entirely male dominated to see that.  I'd go through and site more, but I'll just link to the book I got most of this from in case you're interested.  The first part is pretty ho-hum anthropology but the rest is fascinating.  edit: I forgot to say my conclusion, which is that I think women should be in the military if they want but certain front line jobs where physical strength and coordination are of the highest importance should probably be for men since they are better suited for those specific tasks.  If you wanted to replace every sailor, tank driver and pilot with women though, I'm fine with that."

Speak about yourselves...  A properly female woman can strangle a sabre tooth tiger, with an umbilical cord, with the baby still attached, without making it cry. It's this last quality that sets them apart from men :)   And as for women having better coordination, that is simply not true.   You say that and then speak about strength. It's my experience from martial arts training that women do tend to have better coordination and kinaesthetic sense than men. Possibly because they have to work it harder, because they can't power through lifting something heavy, they actually have to align everything properly and thus train those circuits early on. At the end of training they might not pack the same punch, but they might get you into a lock faster and more securely than any man. None is inherently superior to the other, you just have to adapt to get the most out of every talent people have.   We've been selecting men for hunting and fighting for many thousands of years,   Men tended to be away for long times back in the day (see persistence hunting), women needed to defend themselves and the kids.

It's my experience from martial arts training that women do tend to have better coordination and kinaesthetic sense than men.   It's fine that you think that, you are entitled to your opinion, but the science does not back up your opinion.  Also, only the most basic martial arts moves are practical on the battlefield in full kit.  That's why martial artists wear clothes that allow for free motion.  One more thing, being a soldier is not about being a one man martial arts killing machine, it's about working as a unit and fighting together to overcome an enemy that may or may not be as organized as you.  That's why women in front line combat units complicate battle; If a man is concerned about protecting the women in his unit more than protecting the whole unit because he's had chivalry drilled into his brain since childhood he puts everyone in his unit at risk.  In battle you cannot let emotions control your actions.   Men tended to be away for long times back in the day (see persistence hunting), women needed to defend themselves and the kids.   Convincing a wandering predator your group is not worth the effort of attacking you is not the same as chasing a Mammoth off a cliff or tracking and stalking prey, which are what fighting is really all about: finding your enemy and eliminating him.  That is why in Afghanistan the Taliban started using roadside bombs because our soldiers were far better at a conventional battle.  Then there is the fact that at the camp there is fire, which makes it very easy to scare off animals.   The thing about training requirements is, they're rarely actually based on actual actual needs.

As a side note, one woman actually managed to qualify (in 13 years).   Training is never as rigorous as actual war, that is why you have to train soldiers to the maximum possible while graduating enough soldiers to be effective in the field.  When you lower standards just to be politically correct you are essentially demanding more soldiers die just to satisfy politics at home, and that's just cruel.  Fighting a battle well is about being ruthlessly efficient and anything that hinders that (like pandering to politics) will make the battle harder to win.   Roughly speaking, a requirement that will enable you to drag one and a half soldiers out of danger isn't worth a thing, either drop it to one or raise it to two.

Of course a soldier means a soldier with gear, and, yes, two might, at least in principle, drag three so 1.5 still makes sense. Hence why I said ""roughly"". However, that wasn't my point.   When you lower standards just to be politically correct    ...the point is to have the standards be based on actual requirements, actual tasks, instead of just selecting the top whatever percent of what the general population can do. If the standards are too high for the vast majority of women, so be it. However, you can't justify them being arbitrarily high when there's no actual military reason.

There are good military reasons for the training soldiers do, which is why lowering them for politics puts all the soldiers in danger.  The people who train soldiers know that they could train them 10x as much and it's still not enough to be equal to live combat.  That means less training = more dead soldiers because the deficit in training still has to be made up in battle before a soldier is really combat effective and that deficit is made of dead and wounded soldiers.  They're already asked to put their lives on the line every day they're deployed and it makes no sense to add more weight to that request just so we can include women in combat.  Then there is the fact that the women who are added to units are themselves at greater risk of death and injury so arguing for them to be included is really not doing anybody any favors."

That's a yawning gap that could very easily have an affect on combat effectiveness as well as causing men to work extra hard in other activities like moving and camp, which happened consistently in the Gulf War.  Also you can't know what type of exertions you will be asked to do in combat, so it's not fair to say what is and is not a necessary level of training.  The instructors have at least been in combat usually and can use their experience to try and make the best training regime that can be made.  The training must be intense enough to prepare soldiers for as many different exertions as possible, including pull ups.

Equality,1x6324,Quazz,1 point,Fri Feb 7 20:35:58 2014 UTC,"I served in the United States Navy. I saw women in every career path in the entire squadron, and they did just as well as men in everything (for the most part). We had female medical personnel, aircraft mechanics, electricians, supply staff, logistics personnel, pilots, you name it. In fact, while there were plenty of women in what would be stereotypically labeled as ""men's jobs"" (mechanics, electrical work), there were very few men in any of the ""comfy jobs"" (desk work). There were very few men working these positions who hadn't started off turning a wrench.  Correlation does not equal causation. I'm not trying to make a claim about WHY women had more of the ""comfy"" jobs than men. Perhaps men didn't feel like applying for those jobs. Perhaps my squadron was not representative of the greater Navy. I don't know.  What I DO know is that, regardless of the disparity between the jobs men held and the jobs women held, women were capable of (and very skilled at) every job they took. In fact, the lead supervisors in the electronics and mechanics divisions were both women, and they were the best, most skilled people I knew in their shops.  There were plenty of times when I couldn't figure out how to solve a problem, or couldn't physically manage to fix it. Sometimes there were small spaces and my abnormally huge hands wouldn't fit. Sometimes there would be a nut that seemed to be irrevocably stuck on a bolt, but my supervisor would come along and she'd find a way to get it un-stuck. (Sometimes she just used brute force! She's a very strong woman.)  Bottom line is this: I've seen women excel in every area of military service that I've observed. And while I haven't observed EVERY area of military service, what I have observed is enough to tell me that women are more than capable of serving, even leading, in the military.  Some people follow this whole white-knight idea that women shouldn't be in combat for whatever reason, but I gotta say, there were plenty of women in boot camp with incredibly good shooting scores (better than mine). If we were in combat, I'd be the one holding people back, not the women. I'd choose any of them to watch my back, any day."

They aren't.  I should that is fairly evident.  There's a difference between mean spirited ignorance (I don't care/they have it coming) and honest ignorance (unawareness, making light of a dark situation as she was doing).  Since this story emerged, I've seen so much surprise from people within the gay community, myself included, that ""tranny"" is now considered a slur.  It's great to highlight this issue and say, ""hey, guys, this isn't okay anymore.  Please stop.""  But what I keep seeing is folks acting like she and other people who are indisputable allies are being deliberately and spitefully ignorant.  It is an opportunity for conversation and education.

I've often heard people say that intent doesn't matter, but, to me at least, it most definitely does.  It's important to differentiate between whether or not someone said something out of hate or said it out of ignorance (not knowing).

Equality,1w9hjj,BenjaminGeiger,3,Mon Jan 27 08:37:50 2014 UTC,"I'm really tired of that 'privilege' bullshit I've been seeing around the internet lately.  Why is it that people try to invalidate other people's opinions and points of view because of their race, sexuality or social status or whatever? Because I'm a white straight male, I can't empathize with anyone that's different from me? That's ridiculous. Seems to me that this is a teenager's attempt to win an argument when they just can't argue anymore. So they pull the ""privilege card"" to shut people up and come out on top.  Their basic point is that if you never went through what insert any minority here have been through, then you can't possibly understand them. Hell, I've never been a dog, but I can't stand the sight of an abandoned one. See, I have feelings, and I have a brain, so even if I never went through this or that, I can still be sympathetic toward my fellow human beings (or animals, as in my example) because I don't want them to suffer, or have their rights denied to them. To try to disprove someone's point of view because they've never been through some kind of situation is just absurd.  So, you wanna know why I belive gay people should be able to get married, adopt kids, and live their lives as normally as anyone else? Because there are a lot of them that I love (that includes you, /u/johnnybigoode ), and I want them to be happy and safe. I want them to do anything they want, and I don't want them to be discriminated because they love (and the key word here is 'love') someone from the same sex. And even though I can't say I have queer or trans friends, I do wish them to be happy as well, because I know that the people I love want that for them too, and if they're happy, I'm happy. So it's very plausible for me to pick up that fight. I want to take my kids to visit their two uncles or two aunts and I want that to be ok for them.  Speaking of kids, I want to be a father someday, and I sure as hell won't tell them they can't love someone from the same sex (or that they are obligated to identify to their gender and all that stuff). So I want THEM to be happy too, I want them to be safe. And above all, I want grandkids too, so if they're gay, they should be able to adopt.  So do not come and tell me that I can't voice my opinion because I'm white, straight, male and I have some money on my pocket.  I concede that I don't know what it's like to be gay, and all the struggles that comes with it, but that doesn't mean I can't understand someone that went through this. Besides, I've been a target of prejudice as well, and even if I didn't I'd still want to voice my opinions. My point is, you can't judge anyone because you'll never know their full story. What I do is, when I don't understand something, I ask my gay friends to educate me, and I think that this is something all allies do. I mean, if someone is considered an ally, it's because they want to understand, they want to help, right? Gay people shouldn't pick their allies. And if they are doing something that doesn't match the cause, they should be educated, not shunned. That's why I come to LGBT subreddits whenever something picks my interest.  The same goes for Macklemore. It's very stupid to discredit him because of his status. You don't know why he's doing this, you don't know where he's coming from and what he has been through. Besides, it's not like he's hurting the cause. He may not be talking about everyone that's under the LGBTQ umbrella, but I'll bet he's singing about what's real for him, his reality and what's familiar for him. For that alone he should be respected.  Recently I learned that there are a lot of narrow minded gay people, and there are even a lot of prejudice among them, and this baffles me. This is something very hard for me to understand, because it doesn't make any sense. And all that Macklemore bashing is proof of that. That's a personal opinion, but I think gay people should be the last kind of people to be narrow minded.  These people need to get off of Tumblr a little bit and check their reasoning."

Also, half your arguments make you look like Kanye West defending Kim in the season ending of South Park.   Did you even try to read half of the criticism towards that particular track? Or do you think that anyone who is supportive we should simply accept without thinking twice? Or even trying to make an argument against it is enough to here is just HATE HATE HATE, OH GROW UP YOU!   So let's try to add some context to this discussion, especially about the arguments you made:  It's alright when allies make music to support us.  The problem comes when their lyrics are not exactly aligned with what we spend so many years trying to defend. (this guy made a bunch of decent arguments on this matter http://michaeljkruger.com/macklemores-same-love-and-the-incoherence-of-postmodern-morality/ )  He's white, hetero and had that funny thing going. He has the hipster indie appeal. There is nothing is the track 'Same Love' that was a risk towards his career. Also, his song BARELY explored stereotypes. And even if it DID it was gay male stereotypes.   What disgusts me is when people don't stop to think about the shit being fed to them. It's about a rich straight white boy making this 'ANTHEM FOR LGBT PEOPLE' and anyone who goes against are plain hatters. Macklemore has a lot of good points, but if you wanna talk about 'gay', 'rap' and 'career', there are plenty of gay rappers who got way back in their career when they got out of the closet, Cazwell comes to mind.   Above all, what really pisses me off is that stupid mofo video. It's so straight normative it sucks. It's your basic closeted gay couple that can pass as straight. You wanna really help the 'cause'? Make a video with drag queens, with gender fuck, with queers, with ladyboys, with hard lesbians playing pool.   There are good things related to the track, and the video and blablabla, but simply saying that anyone who criticizes is a hatter, is just closing your ears to any kind of argument."

He recognized the fact that he has privilege (which he also recognizes in regard to his race, btw), and he used that privilege to bring attention to our cause. He created a platform for himself using raw talent, dedication, a fuckload of luck, and, yes, his straight white boy privilege. You know what he did with that platform? He fucking shared it! He made it useful. He offered it up to people who were denied his easy access.  It's not his fault that black and queer artists don't get the recognition they deserve. He was born into this society, same as the rest of us, and he's doing his best to help bring it down. He's not singing from the perspective of drag queens, or lesbians, he's singing from the perspective of a straight white boy who's trying to understand, and those are the same people he reached. Sure, we can argue that queer musicians should have a bigger audience, but he's bloody well helping with that! You think Mary Lambert is sitting there thinking 'fuck, I've lost so many sales because I collaborated with this guy""? Hell no! She's done really well out of it. He's not responsible for her success, but he certainly helped raise her profile. He's not bringing down queer artists just by existing, quite the opposite. He's done exactly what we argue allies should do, and he's taken a lot more shit over it than he would have taken for doing nothing. Hell, I've heard more outrage over his not-perfect lyrics than I've heard over Eminem's borderline-homophobic ones. Which kind of behaviour are we trying to encourage again?  Seriously, can't we give the guy a break?  Edit: Also, you might like Angel Haze's version  Edit edit: Um. Is your link actually arguing that homosexuality is immoral?

The Holly Hobbie line has made tremendous efforts to Disney-fy their products. I grant that they're not giving children credit (for imagination) in providing less and less diverse toys, but their idea might be that it's easier for a child to relate to a young girl than a patchwork doll, and therefore a more profitable business strategy to market less creative toys. Parents likely have the same idea, which then perpetuates the cycle; it's not the kids buying the toys, after all.  I don't agree with companies making this move, and I don't agree with six, ten, and twelve year-olds idolizing short skirts and Valley Girl slang as if those are the true markers of femininity. I think American toy companies should view this article and try and find out where they fucked up in the lives they're marketing to little kids, but I think the economics behind it will prevent them from giving a hoot."

Equality,1vhl8s,nonsensepoem,1 point,Sat Jan 18 09:17:12 2014 UTC,"Whenever I see articles like this, they irritate me. Not because their evidence isn't all true, because usually it is. But because I strongly disagree with the implication that this is being done by companies to influence children.  To understand the mind of a corporation, just imagine that you have absolutely no ethics and only one driving force of your existence: profit. There's no room in there for nefariously plotting to change social dynamics. This is not saying advertizers don't influence children. They do! And in ways so insidious you can barely imagine them! But the purpose is to make the kiddies into lifelong consumers. I genuinely believe that's the only thing that most businesses care about at all.  I think we're looking at these things backwards. I don't think companies are conditioning kids to want gendered toys: I think we should be asking ""Why do these toys sell?"" I don't think you can force someone to want what they don't want in the first place. But I definitely think you can run a gazillion focus groups and scientifically narrow down the most efficient ways of targeting what kids want. We should be asking why aggressively masculine or feminine toys make money. That's the most important thing to keep in mind: companies wouldn't be doing this type of thing unless it brought in profits.  I really think we often blame corporations for exploiting a societal symptom, rather than examining why that symptom exists in the first place. To give an analogy, do you think cereal companies put a lot of sugar in cereals because they're trying to make kids want sugar, or because they know kids already want sugar, so they're trying to out-do the other brand in putting the most sugar in?"
Equality,1vhl8s,AlexReynard,0,Mon Feb 3 02:49:51 2014 UTC,"I agree with you. 100%. There's an idea that floats around that if you consider a ""corporation"" in terms of human psychology, they are ""psychopaths"" for the lack of empathy that they express.   However, I think you miss the point of this post if you believe it's just about blaming the company.  It's exposing the nature of society through the behaviours of a social construct (the corporation).  Having said that, I think if you were to go so far as to say that it's reasonable that corporations behave this way and that the sole responsibility is on the consumer, this is where I might disagree with you. (If that's what you might argue).  The thing is that we already have injected some ethics into corporations by the laws that we set in place. There are limits on how advertisers can advertise to children as an example. Your sugar cereal is an interesting example of that actually. Things have changed over the years.  I think it's reasonable to apply social pressure on these corporations and call out this blatant perpetuation of sexism by publicly calling them out in social media so that it encourages them to change. It's also good to make other people aware so that they too can share this information and the idea can go viral if enough people agree.  Corporations want to appeal to society so that the turn a profit. Video game companies like EA appeals to the LGBT community with their addition of gay characters not because it appeals to their demographic  (or even a substantial new demographic) and would directly make them more money, but because when they appeal to a broader demographic, it enhances their image. It makes them look better in broader society.  Lastly, this kind of perpetuation of sexism hurts society. We are seeing changes made. Some toy companies are showing boys and girls playing with trucks and dolls collectively. Some are refusing to segregate content into ""boys toys"" and ""girls toys""... because in the end.. They are just toys that can be enjoyed by both genders.  However, I think my point can be best summed by a letter written by a 7 year old girl"
Equality,1vhl8s,AlexReynard,1 point,Mon Feb 3 03:06:50 2014 UTC,"Pretty much a ton of agreement here too. It definitely helps to understand how corporations behave to think of them as a psychopathic superorganism. and I'm absolutely in favor of consumers making it clear, ""We're not gonna accept this behavior from you."" But I wish more people would realize, like you say, corproations don't do anything out of the goodness of their hearts. So if you want a company to change its ways, you've got to think of a way to frame what you want so they'll end up making money from it.  I also thought, after I posted, to point out that sometimes companies do do things which are unprofitable. Like sticking with stereotypes in their marketing. This is, I think, most often caused by fear of change. ""This worked before, so we're gonna do it again because it's a proven formula."" People don't wanna rock the boat for fear of getting fired. Often, corporations have to see a reduction in profit to reluctantly try new ideas.   Lastly, this kind of perpetuation of sexism hurts society.   I'll certainly agree with that, in the sense that eating too many desserts hurts your teeth. Meaning, I do think that there are hard-coded gender differences in boys and girls, and I've seen scientific evidence to back it up. But we have the choice to conform to them or not. Just because our genes tell us something, doesn't mean we have to listen. So, yes, these companies are basically giving consumers what they want on a gut level, though that may not be good for them. So, girly things are fine sometimes, boyish things are fine sometimes, but not every boy toy has to be a warrior and the girl toy aisle should be other colors than that eye-gougingly bright hot pink.  Going off memories of my own childhood, I think it's stigma from other kids, more than anything else, that keeps us playing with the 'correct' kind of toys. So, while I'd love to see more gender neutrality in toys and kids' shows (and I'd especially love to see The Smurfette Principle dwindle away) it also has to come with some kind of change in society too. for the past few decades, I've seen a lot of messages of ""Girls can do anything boys can do!"". Now I think it's high time for ""Boys can do girl things and still be boys.""  EDIT: ""I think you miss the point of this post if you believe it's just about blaming the company."" No, but I did think the article was a bit simplistic. Addressing advertizing people and saying, 'This should change' and, like I said, not looking at it from a business perspective and giving them a reason why it might be more profitable to change."

If we both start with $100 and using the same rules I end with $1000 and you end with $10 - is that equal?  Not an equal result, certainly, but an equal chance at a result - yes?  How about the other one?  What if I start with cultural privilege and you get discrimination, but we just make a rule that whatever I earn, you get the same amount?  So it's easy for me to get a job while no one will hire you, but when I earn $1000 you are given $1000 in welfare (and called lazy and without work ethic when you accept it).  That's equal, right?"

Equality,1vau23,CommunistLibertarian,2,Wed Jan 15 21:11:57 2014 UTC,"Cultural privilege is a rather nebulous term IMO.  It can be anything from concrete examples of discrimination (such as women not being hired as often for orchestral seats) or a conglomeration of innocuous items that provide the sense that you are outside of ""normal"" and must struggle to be accepted in society.  One example being the default pronoun in the US is male, thus if we were to think of an imaginary person, the next time I refer to this person with a pronoun, it will likely be ""he"" instead of ""her.""  This doesn't even get into the ""privilege"" of being able to identify with a binary sex classification as opposed to being transgendered or genderqueer.  Cultural privilege is in a sense all the ways a person can benefit from sexual/racial/ancestral/physical/religious discrimination in a society without actively supporting or pursuing that discrimination.  It's a nice term, but it can be overused by those with a victim mentality to turn ""because you are X, you get benefits even if you don't try for them"" into ""because you are X, you are the reason my life is bad.""  Which we can clearly see is just another form of discrimination."

A move which could itself qualify as sexual assault/harassment, by the way.

Perhaps I'm wrong to dislike modern Feminism based on simply on it's less appealing traits, but personally I think it's naive to define a movement based only on it's ""more recognized and highly rated"" qualities. For example, Christianity is all about acceptance of others, and yet has some of the most bigoted racists, sexists and homophobes of the world.

The same for your argument on feminism - I don't think that any part of your argument is necessarily representative of feminism and I'd be extremely concerned about anyone accepting your points based solely on the argument that you have heard or read these things (as yet unsourced).  I would contend that my position that Wikipedia has an accurate (and sourced) definition of feminism is a better place to start debate. My position therefore opposes some of yours, yes."

I have no doubt that there are definitely some very progressive Feminists out there that work for a better future for both men and women. What you have to consider is the overall effects of the people who adhere to various parts of that group.  You seem to be strongly associated with TheBluePill and SRS so I'll use an example you can hopefully feel for: TheRedPill. The definition is simply:   Discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men.    Which seems fairly harmless to me. The problem is that it is a haven for many men who have become disillusioned by women and/or society's treatment of men. This men often harbour hatred towards not only the specific women or situations in which they were burned, but ALL women and the very system itself. There are also many men who simply feel demonized by an overly feminized culture and hope to regain some self esteem and better understand how to be happy and successful. I could claim that TheRedPill is more focussed on self improvement and growth and that anything that is bigoted or hate filled is just trolls, satire or misunderstood. I could say that TheRedPill is a good group and is simply poisoned by people who do not understand it or wish to destroy it. I would only be partly correct. There are many negative aspects of TheRedPill (I'm sure I don't need to list them for you) and overall the community is abhorrent. A similar attitude can be given towards modern Feminism. Yes, at it's core the definition of Feminism is admirable. But there are many situations, this article is a perfect example, where Feminism is as abhorrent as TheRedPill. Some examples of the type of Feminism I dislike is pretty much anything from jezebel or huffington post, Anita Sarkeesian is another good example, a lot of the twitter and youtube feminists, there are many incidents like this, and ofcourse the disgusting circlejerk subreddits that you frequent such as blue pill, SRS etc."

It's not so much that IQ tests and education discriminate against people in poverty, so much as poverty makes it difficult to succeed in education and score well on IQ tests. That is to say, poverty stricken people may well be much more intelligent than can be measured by simple pen and paper tests, but the stressors of living in poverty force the mind to focus it's powers on other types of problem solving. That is what the article is about.  The hands down largest inequality in today's society isn't gender, sexual orientation or even race, but simple class difference. The gap between first world and third world countries is astonishing, and even within first world countries the gap between the poor and the rich is overwhelming.

As it stands, in those fields affirmative action laws apply the same as everywhere else with regards to things like race, but where gender is concerned, where'd the fight go?  I certainly agree with you that in principle, dealing with the issues affecting women should, in theory, also resolve the problems men face. The problem is that in practice, feminists of today are much more concerned with fighting to gain the advantages that men have than fighting to gain the disadvantages that men have.  How many feminists do you think would really spend actual time and resources campaigning that it's unfair that only men are eligible to be drafted by the army?  Look, I mean, I don't blame them for maybe trying to save that argument for last, because clearly there are benefits to putting that particular fight off when there are other issues which would help the gender rather than hurt it. But the point is that when recently the agenda has been to rally and fight against gender disparities which benefit women, and ignore the gender disparities which would be to their detriment, it's hard to say that calling yourself a feminist means you're equally concerned with both genders."
Equality,1ssekh,Quazz,8,Fri Dec 13 12:31:25 2013 UTC,"That may be the intention, but how it works in reality is many feminists mocking people who try to discuss men's issues by parroting 'WHAT ABOUT THE MENS' :/"
Equality,1ssekh,Kimsels,-2,Fri Dec 13 17:55:29 2013 UTC,"That meme is about situations where women are discussing a feminist issue and men come in and try and take over the conversation, yet again. I've yet to hear it about a genuine men's issue.  And it's spelt menz."
Equality,1ssekh,Red_player,2,Fri Dec 13 18:00:46 2013 UTC,"No. It's also meant to silence legitimate criticism. You cannot analyze gender issues by talking only about women's experiences. Most people who identify as feminists do so because they believe women have it worse than men. That necessarily demands that we discuss men's issues for comparison. Since they blindly assume this, men often cite counter-examples because their perspective is being ignored. For example, Sarkeesian keeps making videos about damsels, without once mentioning what it feels like to have a societal obligation to protect women and how men live in fear of proxy violence. Her analysis is only powerful if you pretend men do not have feelings. She describes the portrayal of men in a cold, violent, and hateful way that completely dismisses all hardships they face.  You say you've never heard it about a genuine men's issue? Check your privilege. Part of traditional gender roles is protecting women and shaming men for expressing their emotions.  In fact, every day is ""what about the wymenz"" day. For example, today 120 Kurds were kidnapped in Syria. The headline of every article felt it was important to note that ""at least six women were captured"". Oh? Women, you say?! I guess we care now! Fuck those 114 other... things... whatever they are.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/syria-al-qaida-rebel-group-kidnaps-kurds  http://rt.com/news/syria-kurs-qaeda-kidnap-218/  http://news.yahoo.com/qaeda-rebels-seize-120-syrian-kurds-near-turkish-175636962.html  http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/12/13/339826/militants-kidnap-120-kurds-in-nw-syria/  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=3f3_1386984575  This is a common phenomenon: http://youtu.be/6ZAuqkqxk9A  Imagine what kind of effect this has on how society views women's issues vs men's issues. Maybe men do ""come in and try and take over the conversation, yet again"" in your precious ""space""; but women's issues have always dominated the conversation and heart of society."
Equality,1ssekh,NateExMachina,0,Fri Dec 13 16:02:46 2013 UTC,"Most people who identify as feminists do so because they believe women have it worse than men.   No, this is a straw man. They believe that women have specific problems because of their gender, and that they need to be dealt with in order to achieve equality. This says nothing at all about men's problems one way or the other.  Some feminists certainly think that men have it easy. They are wrong. Men that find all the stereotype man stuff they are expected to do easy and enjoyable have it easy, as do many women who find all the stereotype woman stuff easy and enjoyable. There is just a bias toward men being in power so women's issues tend to get overlooked.   In fact, every day is ""what about the wymenz"" day. For example, today 120 Kurds were kidnapped in Syria. The headline of every article felt it was important to note that ""at least six women were captured"". Oh? Women, you say?! I guess we care now! Fuck those 114 other... things... whatever they are.   This is merely a matter of perspective. You say this is about women being prioritized, I say it's about women being patronized and belittled, and not seen as equal beings with their own agency. We can both agree this is wrong. Coming in and arguing about it is just derailing the issue.   women's issues have always dominated the conversation and heart of society.   And that is just utter shite."
Equality,1ssekh,hp0,-1,Fri Dec 13 21:11:32 2013 UTC,"There's a lot of misrepresentation of men's issues out there. Don't get duped by the so-called ""Men's Rights Movement"". It's more about leveraging the few issues that men face as a weapon against feminism."
Equality,1st2nd,AcidentallyMyAccount,3,Fri Dec 13 17:27:11 2013 UTC,"This is, of course, like any study only indicative of a trend and the paper itself pushes for further research in areas it may have missed. However, this compounds with previously linked papers on the global gender disparity in science. Additionally, the conclusions this paper did reach are strong:   Those of a misogynistic bent might read this study as confirming their view that women's research is weaker than men's and there is less of it. Such a simplistic interpretation dismisses the vast implications embedded in these data. Our study lends solid quantitative support to what is intuitively known: barriers to women in science remain widespread worldwide, despite more than a decade of policies aimed at levelling the playing field. UNESCO data show that in 17% of countries an equal number of men and women are scientists. Yet we found a grimmer picture: fewer than 6% of countries represented in the Web of Science come close to achieving gender parity in terms of papers published.  For a country to be scientifically competitive, it needs to maximize its human intellectual capital. Our data suggest that, because collaboration is one of the main drivers of research output and scientific impact, programmes fostering international collaboration for female researchers might help to level the playing field.  That said, if there were a simple solution or programme that could improve matters, this issue would already be solved. Unfortunately, behind this global imbalance lie local and historical forces that subtly contribute to the systemic inequalities that hinder women's access to and progress in science. Any realistic policy to enhance women's participation in the scientific workforce must take into account the variety of social, cultural, economic and political contexts in which students learn science and scientific work is performed. Each country should carefully identify the micro-mechanisms that contribute to reproducing the past order. No country can afford to neglect the intellectual contributions of half its population.   Emphasis added. I think it's a pretty reasonable request if you take the view that all humans are created equal and each one has a potential intellectual capacity they can contribute to a particular field. Maximizing this capacity isn't just beneficial to women, it's beneficial to all those who live in a technologically and scientifically advanced era."
Equality,1st2nd,AcidentallyMyAccount,4,Fri Dec 13 17:31:07 2013 UTC,"There is no consensus on the reasons for these gender differences in research output and collaboration — whether it is down to bias, childbearing and rearing, or other variables.   This is the most important line I read. There are a few things to consider here, firstly that taking a global stance is problematic in that many countries and communities still openly discourage women in science. I would find that if there was no significant global gender imbalance then you could assume that some countries are inherently favouring the female research to counterbalance the misogyny in other countries, arguably engaging in misandry. Secondly, as stated in the above line, any statistics that take in the whole group will be subject to the fact that women much more likely to take at least several months and often several years off to raise children. Interruptions in research like this will lead to a natural decrease in quality and quantity of publications. So again, if the statistics were even then one could assume that women were being favoured. Finally, and most importantly, as quoted, it is unclear how much of this disparity is due to my first two points and how much is to do with:   local and historical forces that subtly contribute to the systemic inequalities that hinder women's access to and progress in science   I see the article claims:   It should serve as a call to action for the development of higher education and science policy.   In regards to supporting women in science. However I see that in several countries the females (despite my point about child rearing) actually have higher publishing rates and there seems to be no claim that there is anything wrong with that at all. Overall I found this to be a highly feminist article highlighting gender disparity to be a 'women only' type problem. This reminds me of the campaign to have more women in universities, but there's no problem when women eventually start outnumbering men. Gender equality is important, but when articles like this focus so specifically on one gender I get the feeling that they aren't so concerned with equality, but more concerned with empowering a single gender.  As a sidenote, thank you for submitting this, lately a lot of submissions have been lacking any quality, and although as stated Nature.com isn't the best source, it's a huge step up from other anecdotal or self report studies submitted previously."
Equality,1st2nd,AcidentallyMyAccount,2,Sat Dec 14 17:06:07 2013 UTC,"You wrote:   I would find that if there was no significant global gender imbalance   There was no evidence for this except in countries with extremely low publication of scientific studies like Turkmenistan.   Only nine countries had female dominance in terms of proportion of authorships, and five of these (Macedonia, Sri Lanka, Latvia, Ukraine, and Bosnia and Herzegovina) had more than 1,000 articles in our analysis. In other words, female authorship is more prevalent in countries with lower scientific output.  Countries with more than 1,000 papers and high degrees of male dominance include, unsurprisingly (in order of output): Saudi Arabia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Cameroon, Qatar and Uzbekistan. US states with more than 1,000 articles with a gender assigned and high male dominance include New Mexico, Mississippi and Wyoming. The US states and Canadian provinces that are closest to achieving gender parity (and have more than 1,000 articles) include Vermont, Rhode Island, Maine, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Quebec. Again, some of these states and provinces are among the lowest ranking in terms of scientific output.   Overall, their research indicates a gendered bias.   Globally, women account for fewer than 30% of fractionalized authorships, whereas men represent slightly more than 70%. Women are similarly underrepresented when it comes to first authorships. For every article with a female first author, there are nearly two (1.93) articles first-authored by men.   You wrote:   any statistics that take in the whole group will be subject to the fact that women much more likely to take at least several months and often several years off to raise children. Interruptions in research like this will lead to a natural decrease in quality and quantity of publications   This is one of the problems with the way academics is structured now. The publish-or-die model not only disadvantages researchers committed to long-term and careful analysis, it also disadvantages women who must take maternity leave. A few European countries have attempted to reconcile this with longer paid maternity leave but it is imperfect. That this model currently exists indicates an institutional blindness to the needs of women in professional studies along with a blindness towards to research and publication of good science.  In any case, I also don't understand why there is a pushback against Nature in the Equality subreddit. Nature and other large academic journals are disliked not because they publish biased or flawed studies but rather because they are a symbol of the publish-or-die model. These journals are hated by those advancing the open-access model and this study provides evidence for why we should move to open-access models. It's sort of punk in how it sought publication in Nature of an article generally critical of big journals. If you object to Nature being posted on the grounds of favoring an open-access model, fine, but the criticism of Nature does not extend to good/bad science except as an overall historical trend. Individual studies deserve to be criticized individually; if this were coming from some small, unknown journal without much credibility or history, I could see the issue. But this is Nature; their impact factor is high which means the studies published must stand up to much more public scrutiny.   No worries about my submitting these articles. I'm glad you're reading them and I hope they're as fruitful for your intellectual growth as they are to mine.  edit: added a few links, clarity"
Equality,1st2nd,AcidentallyMyAccount,1 point,Sat Dec 14 18:44:17 2013 UTC,"I'm not an expert on the matter but I'll do my best to explain why I find studies published in a journal that is part of the publish-or-die model to be an unfavored source. As you seem to already know, part of the reason the publish-or-die model exists and is problematic to modern science is to do with funding. To get funding for current or future research you need to show that your research is worth investing in through publishing. That means that anything you do research and publish has to appeal to people who would further fund you, otherwise your career will suffer. This means that you have a huge incentive to deliver specific results or conclusions from research rather than remaining completely impartial. You can hopefully understand my skepticism when I read the article about the kinds of conclusions they drew from the data. If I had my whole career on the line I would tell the apple company that an apple a day definitely keeps the doctor away, and would want it published in a journal of high popularity and esteem. I would not want to be the guy who published that apples cause cavities in some lesser journal. As a third party, when I read that apples are god's fruit in Nature while an independent study found that apples are practically candy, I have a natural suspicion towards apples. I wholeheartedly agree with you that the current academic model is flawed. I simply found this article to be not entirely 'equal' when it approached the issue of gender imbalance."
Equality,1st2nd,AcidentallyMyAccount,2,Sat Dec 14 19:15:53 2013 UTC,"I did post a few studies previously that showed that funding for women was similarly skewed here.  That said, yes, grants and funding do introduce bias but this is a problem with any study done under a capitalistic system. The question, then, is what studies would you regard as sufficiently objective? If we were to take your worldview, we would be incapable of drawing any conclusions from any science-related studies but for the publicly funded ones put forth by the CDC and NIH and even then it's arguable whether or not there are biases there. So the question becomes 'are there any sources of information that you can trust'?  I understand a certain amount of skepticism but the paralysis of belief in the face of an otherwise transparent and methodologically sound study seems a little too much."
Equality,1st2nd,Quazz,1 point,Sat Dec 14 19:23:58 2013 UTC,"I also commented on the top comment of that thread.  I didn't put the whole study into doubt, simply some of the conclusions they drew. Like I quoted from the study, there still remains no clear consensus on exactly how much of the gender disparity in science is natural and how much comes from male preference bias. Yes, I am constantly skeptical of all studies done, but the more consensus there is amongst academics, the informed populous and my own reasoning the more credence any claim has. Likewise when there seems to be many differing claims, I am quick to point out the issues. In this case, the article completely ignored one half of the gender disparity as a problem to be addressed simply because it was a small minority, exposing a potential bias of the conclusions they had about the majority."
Equality,1st2nd,Quazz,2,Sat Dec 14 19:39:58 2013 UTC,"They did not ignore gender disparity for males, not when they separated by disciplines.    Our disciplinary results confirmed previous findings and anecdotal knowledge about fields associated with 'care'. Specialties dominated by women include nursing; midwifery; speech, language and hearing; education; social work and librarianship. Male-dominated disciplines include military sciences, engineering, robotics, aeronautics and astronautics, high-energy physics, mathematics, computer science, philosophy and economics. Although disciplines from the social sciences show a larger proportion of female authors, the humanities are still heavily dominated by men.   However, their analysis shows that overall women are published far less frequently than men despite having higher impact measures. This study exists only to argue the point that the disparity exists like many of the previous studies they've cited (1 2 3 4 5 6 7). They do not reach a consensus for the reasons of the existence but this does not obviate the fact that it is there and that it favors men.   There is no consensus on the reasons for these gender differences in research output and collaboration — whether it is down to bias, childbearing and rearing9, or other variables.   From what I understand of their research, it's that they started with an objective, gender-neutral data set and then separated them by gender. More statistical analysis was applied to the impact factor and to differentiate between countries and this analysis demonstrated that there was not parity between the sexes. Taken as a whole, it seems to largely favor men. Broken into disciplines, there are some fields that favor men but predominantly men are still published far more often than women. The study also addressed the presumption that women would not work in risky fields and that this precludes women from being published (due to in-field competition) but this was not shown to be the case when broken down by discipline."
Equality,1st2nd,Quazz,1 point,Sat Dec 14 19:54:13 2013 UTC,"What they have done is assume that because the global science academic is dominated by males that there must be something actively stopping women from dominating these arenas, something that is unnatural and needs to be addressed. At the start of the article they talk about how females already have started dominating males in universities and later they also mention that several countries have females dominating in academia, and that this is natural and has no need to be addressed. They don't actually show or prove in any conclusive manner exactly what causes this disparity, they simply show that it exists. But then they claim, unabashedly, that there are barriers to women in the form of local and historical forces that subtly contribute to systemic inequalities. They don't disprove the 'misogynistic' view that women's research is weaker than men's, nor do they even offer up any other probable causes such as less drive for success and funding, less time or effort spent on research, or bad focus on high demand research. They don't actually mention any specific barriers or forces that they claim exist to stop women, so they can't even begin to prove that they exist. That is what irks me about this article, it takes a study and draws complete horseshit conclusions from it."
Equality,1st2nd,KHJohan,2,Sat Dec 14 20:16:53 2013 UTC,"Their conclusion isn't necessarily biased considering how much academically rigorous research has been done on this topic already. Also, like I said above, suggesting that the publish-or-die model of academic publishing leads to a subtle gender bias is one that can be drawn from their analysis which shows a global disparity.  You wrote:   They don't disprove the 'misogynistic' view that women's research is weaker than men's, nor do they even offer up any other probable causes such as less drive for success and funding, less time or effort spent on research, or bad focus on high demand research.   They refer to this as misogynistic because biological determinism has been proven fallacious. Gender is not a good determinant of individual drive or capability, far less so than other factors such as socioeconomic status. Even so, a previous study did measure the impact of women's work in a male-dominated, risky field and find it to be higher, on average, which could indicate anything from the idea that women are better at research or that there exists barriers for less impactful studies authored by women.   Our analysis unambiguously shows that for all ranges of number of publications, female faculty members in ecology published research with higher impact than their male counterparts, whereas for faculty in chemistry we found no significant gender-specific differences in impact.   The study we are discussing is not conclusive nor does it seek to be so. The points it makes in the conclusion and in the section leading up to it are merely suggestive, not conclusive, and itself indicates that more research should be done to establish what the reasons for this disparity are. If you find this irksome then you may find every scientific study to be irksome. After all, the model of science is uniform and gradual and theories emerge after repeated trials and experiments build on each other. As far as I can tell, this study does not conclude in excess. It's further proof of disparity and indicative of why they might exist."
Equality,1sqzmi,mdoddr,13,Thu Dec 12 22:15:32 2013 UTC,"There is no mention of what proportion are actually seeking funding for studies. If we knew this, the final figures would have some kind of context. For example, we might discover that massive amounts of women are not actually being denied funding, but are not seeking it to begin with. With this information we might actually be able to understand the true nature of inequality."

Or they have more prestigious titles. Some of it could simply be legacy problems (not enough older female scientists), some could be problems in the grant process, and some could be difficulties women have getting promotions (which attracts more funding)."
Equality,1sqzmi,JustinJamm,1 point,Fri Jan 3 14:50:07 2014 UTC,"To add to this, there was a gender study done that said that males naturally requested more money/resources than females in any given situation. The reasoning seemed to be that men requested, or even demanded, as much as they thought they could get, while women often simply requested as little as they thought was fair or required. This could have a large effect on scientific funding when men are openly demanding as much as they can get, while women might be requesting only as much as they need. In this case it is no fault of the funders to only provide what they have been convinced to."
