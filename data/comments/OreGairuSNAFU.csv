But to put it briefly, it's a story about self growth, finding one true self and conflicting ideals, it's way too long to just put it in one comment, if you mentioned a specific topic then we could go with that.   On Haruno, her motives are not clear, some argue she's mean because it's the only way that Yukino will ever be independent, since she always keeps an eye on her and is interested in what she does, you can actually see she cares about her a couple of times and how she was happy she found ""friends"", even more, she wanted them to be actual friends, and that's where the Valentine's thing comes, she mentions how they're slowly becoming a superficial group just like Hayama's, the exact same thing Hachiman despised and wanted to avoid in S1."
OreGairuSNAFU,3e0uux,DaniSenpai,2,Tue Jul 21 02:35:24 2015 UTC,"Seconding this.  OP, you can find tons of discussion by browsing the threads back to the start of the season.  A lot of good discussion happened on anonymous imageboards as well, but that's mostly lost to time now.  As a further thought, a lot of the people who ""get the joke"" relate to the series and understand it because it resonates with their experience.  I don't want to know how old you are, but it's possible that you might be lacking the perspective that life experience gives which older fans of the series bring to bear in their discussions.  Even so, it's not as though Oregairu is especially esoteric.  Maybe you'll pick up on more with subsequent viewings."
OreGairuSNAFU,3e0uux,socalso,2,Tue Jul 21 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"I used to be in the same boat as you. Something that really helped was looking through all of the episode discussion threads and other discussion threads I found on the sub, as well as rewatching from the beginning. You should have a pretty solid understanding after that. There are also some episode reviews on YouTube that have been posted on this sub that also go pretty in depth into the show.  As for Yukino's sister being mean to her, it is also discussed in the threads and this review, but I think it comes down to her trying to fix Yukino's dependency issue. Yukino is completely dependent on other people, and she has been since she was a little child following in her sister's footsteps. Haruno noticed this and continues to try to push her to make her own decisions and be independent. This is why she often comes across as mean. In reality, she is probably the person who knows Yukino the best. She can evaluate a situation very quickly and understand the mechanics of a group from a little observation. This is exemplified in episode 12 of Zoku. Haruno also pushes Yukino in episode 13 of Zoku). I think Haruno does care for her sister and is trying to help her, but has grown exasperated at Yukino's inability to solve her core problem for several years. Anyway, I hope that helped."

Subs weren't the best thing on earth (commie's known for ""meme-fying"" their subs), but did the job for most. I mean, the alternative was waiting a day for Crunchyroll subs, which had some odd translations. Not unwatchable, but still bad.  Series ended a while ago, though. That means you have more sub options. Great translation groups often take their time, so I would advise you to ignore Commie and check for other groups.  Oh, before I forget. Camilla. That's why commie's popular."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dvwl6,txchr15,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer* I'm not trying to be an ass. I am asking a genuine question.  What made CR's subs so bad? That is where I watched Oregairu and Zoku, and I thought the subs made sense for the most part (there may be parts that I don't remember, but I thought it was ok). I just genuinely want to know what makes CR subs bad and Commie's good, and if you have any comparisons I would like to see them.   I always see people hating on CR subs in particular, but I think they are fine. Obviously I don't know if the subs are always accurate, because if I did, I would know Japanese and therefore not need subs in the first place.   What I do think, is that people tend to bandwagon even if they do not know whether or not something may be correct. This is the reason why I ask why commie's is better and not CR. Because people like to bandwagon without thinking for themselves, and I tend to take most things with a grain of salt.  That being said... Personally, I don't like people adding memes to anything that isn't supposed to have them, so you saying that Commie added memes makes me glad I didn't watch it using their subs (other than the batman mask op for the last episode, which I only found mildly amusing)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dvwl6,sbailzy,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"I watched both versions of Zoku and Commie just did a better job during some of the more impactful scenes imo.   For example, Commie ""I want something genuine"" vs CR ""I want the real thing"". Looking at the nuances between genuine and real in context, I believe genuine to be a better English interpretation.  Another one I really preferred Commie for was Yukino's conversation with 8man at the end of EP 7. 8man gave Hayama a piece of advice back in EP 2, which both CR and Commie translated to something along the lines of ""if that's enough to tear you guys apart, maybe you weren't all that close to begin with"". Yukino more or less echoes his own words back at him here but CR kinda just went with something completely different, which really diminished the strength of her words. Commie pretty much mirrored the previous translation so it was easy to tell why Yukino's words had the effect they did on 8man."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dvwl6,TheEliteNub,0,Mon Jul 20 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for the reply. After rewatching the ""I want the real thing"" scene, I am on the fence. ""Genuine"" sounds better, but ""real thing"" sounds like something Hachiman would actually say, imo. So that one is kind of a toss up.  For your second one, I still felt what Yukino was saying, seeing the effect on Hachiman, was still good for CR.  Thanks again for your reply, it just seems that the differences are just from different people nitpicking at the nuances, and not necessarily the quality. Sure there are going to be hiccups for both sides, but they don't seem to be as big a deal as people make them out to be."

That's why Oregairu is very loved, it takes the basics of any cliche romcoms and subverts them starting with the classic self-insert main protagonist and instead adding a pessimistic loner.   For example, Haganai is related a lot to Oregairu but the only real reason why most people say that is because both MCs are loners and the plot happens because of a school club. But those two series are very VERY different from each other.   You can still find other good romcomes like Noucome (the guy who makes the choices) but if you liked Nisekoi then I honestly can tell you to watch any cliche romcome. You're probably gonna like them too."

Anyway I'd say Yukino and Yui and Hachiman have at least that, some love.  Do they really want steady relationship?  I think Hachiman is undecided as Yui is, and Yukino needs to get straightened up a bit and then she won't be afraid or hesitate.  I'd pity the fool Yukino fancied then, she'd hunt him and take down like a jaguar, crushing any and all opposition.   Raawrrrrrr!"
OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,RalphZiggy,8,Fri Jul 17 14:47:21 2015 UTC,"This. While it is very important to choose wisely, it is also equally important to understand that the one Hikki will chose...will not necessarily be his life partner. They are still growing, and trying to learn, and very possibly, fail with their relationships. I believe that that's what the ""boyfriend-girlfriend"" phase is.    As such, as much as a Yui lover I am, I think whichever route Hachiman chose (Yui / Yuki / hitori) would be fine, as long as all three of them are able to be honest with each other. And I can't wait to (hopefully) see that kind of development in the final volume."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,albert_2mb,11,Fri Jul 17 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"The one Hikki will chose... will not necessarily be his life partner.   I know they're not adults yet but they still have more values than most real-life adults. Hachiman, for instance, seems like the engaged kind of lover. Just look at how he treats the only person he truly loves. If he were to chose one of them as his love partner, he would never betray them or let their relationship die that easily, it would mostly depend on the girl and if she returns his affections.  However, both girls are also the same engaged lover so I wouldn't worry too much about their relationship once they start. In conclusion, OP is making a good question since it all depends on how they start it. The most important part is to ensure that what they're feeling is real. Once they pass that, the rest will be way easier."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Fri Jul 17 21:12:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points regarding the three of them being engaged lovers, and they must ensure that what they're feeling is real. Hopefully they will be able to achieve that understanding before going into the relationship.     I personally think that there are certain elements that can only be understood after going into a relationship. However, with Hikki being able to understand personalities, Yui being able to know what she wants, and Yukino trying her best to understand her feelings, hopefully they can find out what's best for them before the ""decision""."

OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,Xervicx,2,Fri Jul 17 21:54:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I really like the way the relationships are handled here. Yukino, I feel has dependency issues, so second guesses her relationships as being fake, especially since her sister keeps making that claim. Also, her sister seems to be trying to push her (kind of like how 8ballbro often tries to be the bad guy for the sake of others) so that Yukino will be honest with herself and quit doubting.  As for Yui... her feelings seem less genuine. She almost seems to be forcing herself to have those feelings, or at least to have them as much as she does. I think there are some genuine feelings there, but she obsesses over them too much and seems to be too focused on making sure she feels those feelings.  Iroha is just insecure and wants people to find her attractive, both so she can validate herself and so she can manipulate them. She respects 8m8 more due to him being not as easily fooled.  And all of them need a lot of growing. 8senpai I think finds them all attractive, but feels some for Yukino that he seems to finally have noticed and admitted in the latest episode. As for Yui, I think he had some sort of crush, but it also might have been from his desire to be nice to her (as he even thinks of how he goes so far to protect his sister and make her happy prior to him agreeing to go on dates with Yui)."

If that's the case, perhaps the feelings that were trapped inside, the answers too will change. Supposing. Supposing if. If those feelings became anything special."" This is from the LN regarding Yui. I would argue that Hachiman still doubts Yui's intentions.   However, either way, it will resolve the love triangle issue. Yui/Yukino realising their feelings for Hachiman being not genuine will solve the whole thing and tie in nicely with what Hachiman says about ""the problems were certainly linked"" ""it is not definite that they (Yui and Hachiman's wishes) cannot become one."""

I can understand it though... am I the only one who thinks that she seems to act guilty all the time for no reason? Beyond the whole ""feeling responsible for holding the group together"" thing. So I wonder if her feeling that way has something to do with it.  But yeah, love triangles are really weird. I just wonder how they'll resolve it. A lot of stories like this end without anything being resolved, but the way this one is structured there's just no way they can leave it open ended. ToraDora is similar in that respect, because they couldn't have ended it without the complicated love triangles (or rectangle or whatever you'd call it) being unresolved.  While their feelings not being genuine and both of them realizing that would solve everything, I feel like the series has already made a habit of showing that people's feelings will get hurt, regardless of what works best for everyone. Maybe that could happen with one of them, I suppose, but both of them feeling that way would be a bit too convenient yeah?  And I wonder where that'd leave Hachiman. Would all three of them have false feelings? I do want at least some sort of confession to happen.

OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,Fruitsy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:27:28 2015 UTC,"Well Yukino can lose but I dont want it to be a situation where its like ""Sorry Hikigaya-kun, I was just using you as a crux for the past 4 volumes or so and thus I am going to drop out of the 8bowl) and never have her give her chocolates/cookies to him (her giving her treats to Hachiman is a big deal in the future I think unless Watari just wants to crush Yukinofags)"
OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,LadWatcherIsHere,0,Fri Jul 17 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry Hikigaya-kun, I was just using you as a crux for the past 4 volumes or so and thus I am going to drop out of the 8bowl   Considering this is Yukino we're talking about, that's entirely possible. How she comes to realize if her feelings are real or just another semblance of dependency is what's important and if she actually concludes that her feelings are not real, she would still feel grateful to Hachiman for helping her to achieve what she's been chasing this entire time: Change.  That's what really matters here. At least, that's what matters to them the most."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,Fruitsy,4,Fri Jul 17 21:02:42 2015 UTC,I guess. I suspect Yukino's request will tie into Hachiman's genuine one and it will be this that determines everything  Romance has always been a secondary problem for Hachiman and Yukino while its a primary issue for Yui. Though Yui's relevance towards the story has been dwarfed by Yukino and 8man (their relationship and interactions take precedence over pretty much everything else)
OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,razor150,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Yukino not being in love with Hachiman doesn't stop her from developing something genuine with him. It would just mean they are friends who understand and accept each other, and that she has grown as a person.  To be honest, if this is what happens it instantly solves Yui's problem since she doesn't want to lose Yukino or Hikki."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,Yamigosaya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:33:33 2015 UTC,"Well since its rom-com its impossible for anyone to fall out of the 8bowl but also since its Yahari, things might be different.   also this is all but a speculation nothing has been confirmed yet also dont misunderstood me, i dont hate yukino."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,razor150,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"The think Hachiman has to understand, and I think he showed that he was stating to at the end of the season finale. Something genuine takes time, and effort. The one genuine relationship he has is with his sister, they understand each other, accept it, ad still love each other. They had time to get to that point. Yui, and Yukino haven't really known him that long but both are willing to try and find something genuine, so they are halfway there. The longer you are friends with someone the more likely it is genuine.  You also can't have true love without it being genuine.   If you wanted to rate whose love for Hachiman is more genuine right now it would easily be Yui. She now knows what Hachiman is like, has some understanding, and is accepting. Her problem is is that she would accept a lie if they could all remain friends together, to move on she has to accept that to have something real and worthwhile that may not be possible. She may be making progress, since she did know her proposal would be turned down.  Yukino's feelings are too confused right now with her dependency issues. You could say much of the same things about Yukino getting to know Hachiman as Yui, but she has allowed her getting to know to know him to turn in to a reliance in him to help her get going, to help her make decisions. She has no sense of self, so she can never truly love someone if she needs them to give her a sense of identity.  Of the two, Yui is the one who has the easiest problem to solve. Does that mean she will be first to resolve it? Not necessarily."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dmktw,socalso,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:24:27 2015 UTC,"The only girl who has ""earned"" the full 8 inches is Komachi.  So I think talking about ""love"" and ""deserving"" is a small case of missing the point, at least from a Western metaphysical perspective - in which love cannot ever truly be earned, but is a gift given freely or not at all.  I think we can all say at this point that what the Service Club is doing - willing the Good of each another - is a demonstration of a very genuine kind of love.  Everything else is simply incidental to that.  edit: guess you guys aren't having a little cheekiness on the endless waifu shitposting, huh"

As of right now, I feel there are a few pieces missing, the ones that really put the whole picture together and in perspective.   What is Hayato's purpose in the romance? I feel his backstory is super important, and I can't tell if he's crushing on the older or younger Yukinoshita, or if there's a dramatic element in the past that has been omitted for a big reveal.  What is the Yukinoshita mothers plot in all this? It almost feels like there might be an arranged marriage or something down the line?  Also, maybe the 'something genuine' will only come out when they all break out of their shells? I feel like lots of tears and feels will come out, and they will all have to break through that wall to actually confront the truths we have been building up to."

Some parts were left out like the cookies that they are not well made yet and Yui tried her best in making them. Edit: in the anime I mean, they didn't add them and cut them.    Yuigahama gave us a small lonely smile. ""If we find out about each other's feelings, I think we won't be able to stay the way we are now. That's why, this is probably our last consultation. Our last request will be about us.""   I'm pretty sure I didn't hear this in the anime, this is exactly like everyone discussed.    “And, one more thing.” Yukinoshita offered a smile, and turned her ever beautiful face towards us. As I waited for her to continue her words, she took a step. A step towards us. One gentle step. “My request, will your hear it?” In between bouts of embarrassment, Yukinoshita said those words, to which Yuigahama smiled broadly.   Hachiman with her beautiful face line made me smile, haha.  and the infamous cliffhanger which makes the wait more unbearable."
OreGairuSNAFU,3dhm33,paladinmahdi,3,Thu Jul 16 10:49:24 2015 UTC,"Wtf, I could've sworn I typed them out >< will add them in later.  Probably mobile deleted them somehow while I was editing it.  Edit: added it in, I believe you meant this?  The cookies that I could see from the cellophane bag were irregularly shaped, or had traces of burn marks or had an unusual hue to it. I could not honestly say that it was pretty. However, one could tell from a glance that it was homemade. From this result, one could tell the effort and seriousness she put into it despite her being bad at cooking. Yukinoshita gazed blankly at the cookie in my hand and let out a mixed sigh. “Handmade cookies? This, is made by you alone?"" ""But it is a bit of a failure isn't it?"" Yukinoshita shook her small head as though that didn't matter at all whilst Yuigahama brushed off her embarrassment with a smile. ""Yuigahama-san, you are... amazing."" Her voice seemed like she was trying to be kind, or perhaps there was a sense of longing to it. Yukinoshita looked shyly at Yuigahama. Yuigahama returns her look with a happy smile. ""I said that I'd try it on my own. I said that I would do it my own way. And this is what I came up with."""

A lot of people seem to forget that after a number of rejections Hachiman is very unlikely to be able to discern niceness and true affection or flirtatious behaviour.   Source: Me, after being rejected by girls during my 7th - 9th year of schooling, I had lost the ability (or never had) to detect whether a girl was into me. At graduation I found out from a number of friends that a few girls who were flirty with me actually had a crush/were into me.   If the author has been as spot on with Hachiman as he has been in the past. I have no doubt that Hachiman is suspicious, but is unsure."

Yui wants all the things you mentioned, but behind all those things, her true main desire is the trio being genuine with one another (like your theory suggests). This is why she cries when 8man sees what she's doing and stops her. They are tears of happiness, not because she's been rejected through reprimand, but because she is glad 8man wants the same thing as she does enough to stop her actions, that something genuine.

It's been pretty enjoyable so far: the S1 anime definitely had the more relaxing slice-of-life elements that nonetheless has a lot of underlying depth, and I've noticed through the S2 LN that the written word is a really, really effective vehicle for a series like Oregairu, especially considering all the subtlety and recurring themes.

OreGairuSNAFU,3daoua,Yamigosaya,2,Tue Jul 14 23:39:16 2015 UTC,There's no Iroha in the first OP. So I guess they wanna keep it free of spoiler til she actually shows up for her debut.

OreGairuSNAFU,3d9vxf,FatFluffyFish,4,Tue Jul 14 17:10:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know when does this scene play out, so my interpretation might be off, but if we take the last few moments of the anime, it's not that hard to interpret.   Yui's wish is that they all remain stagnant and preserve status quo, as seen in the last episode. Hachiman throws it off as it wouldn't be genuine.    However, the shape that they take differs slightly and they will not perfectly overlap with each other.   So my guess is that his wish is also for three of them to be happy together but with slight alterations (him ending up with one of them).     (Disclaimer: Text above is my subjective analysis)"
OreGairuSNAFU,3d9vxf,pEuAsTsSy,8,Tue Jul 14 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe he is undecided and is saying the wish is to be together for now but being couple with one of them in the future and that's where there might be a difference.  Of course, worth pointing out he also thinks ""I can see how this will go  already, I'll  probably wind up with nothing"".  I've mentioned elsewhere maybe he thinks a Yukino with her problems solved would go for much more promising guy than him since she is in higher social caste, but I'm still wondering what he imagines would be hindering with Yui.  He might worry about genuine connection since he likes to speak of philosophical and intellectual matters while she is more normal and ordinary in that regard, though he recognizes she has some amazing gifts as being mediator / liaison, ability to sense feelings and mood, as well as being optimistic and energetic.   I'll agree the ship has not sunk but has competition, and that for some reason he see problem with Yui"

Anyways, this particular train of thought isnt unlike the one he had with Yukino in 10.5 about colored skies but it is slightly different   Either way, there’s no doubt that the both of us had made the wrong call. Whether it was me, her, or ourselves, we still had yet to come to an understanding. And that was presently like the state of the sky that expanded beyond the window, the sky that belonged to any one person. While you were unable to distinguish between noon and night, the moment you could tell was the moment the color of would change, moment by moment. While answering, I looked at the same sunset. Regardless, it’s likely the color we were seeing were different. Red, pink, or scarlet. Perhaps, vermillion or even dark red. It may very well be orange. But no matter what the color, it wouldn’t have bothered me   I guess the bigger picture here is that Hachiman realizes that his desires may eventually overlap with that of Yukino and Yui's even if the wishes or skies are slightly different as of now"

OreGairuSNAFU,3d12dk,WhatsupSoul,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Welp. That's how all anime projects work usually. One of the things anime is famous for is their terrible dedication to the animation, ironically. The scenes where the characters talk are basically just moving the mouth while keeping everything else the same. There is also how the fight scenes are full with talking and slow movements and hardly have fluid movements.  Depends on the studio how mediocre the animation is. For example there is the animation for season 1. Around that time Oregairu had yet to raise as one of the top LN and so it got a terrible studio. Now compare it to this current animation now that the series became famous. Of course they gave it more work."

My main issue with Yukino is that she's ignored for the entire novel. Since the whole thing is from Hachiman's POV, we can hardly come up with reasons to explain her changes in behavior but there are tons of times where her current attitude contradicts everything that was established about her before. Examples:   Not doing a thing while Hachiman solves most problems. Letting Sagami stomp on her like a slave. Making excuses to prove her point.   There was zero development in her character during these 11 volumes and the only thing that changed was that she got a crush on Hachiman and I still believe that crush is a misunderstanding in which Yukino sees her new found dependence on him as love."
OreGairuSNAFU,3d4drf,LadWatcherIsHere,6,Mon Jul 13 13:15:10 2015 UTC,"Yukino did have development, she went from being totally alone to having friends and acquaintances.  From not being able to admit or share problems or confide in anyone to starting to do so.  From not admitting she has problems to identifying some of them.    Besides you're leaving out Hachiman, it'll be his choice and he just might go for the arrogant, mocking, messed-up, self-righteous, idealistic but useless in reality, rationalizing and self-excusing mess that is Yukino.    But then I have little use for balls of moe like Yui, either in anime or real life.  Nice airheaded girls with no depth, who needs 'em?"

OreGairuSNAFU,3d4drf,RalphZiggy,2,Tue Jul 14 02:32:24 2015 UTC,"The development you're pointing out is in her relationships which has always been the main focus of this series. The characters are known and very liked by the audience for their attitude, something that remains the same during the entire novel until certain turning points. However, the only one whose change has been very ambiguous is Yukino herself with no explanation of why she acts in certain ways.  The development you're talking about, if you stop to think about it, is not really development at all. At Vol. 11 we find out that Yukino has dependency issues which shows that she hasn't changed over the course of the series. She simply opened herself more to the main characters but at the end, she's still relaying on everyone she can to do her job.  About the rest. That's a bias opinion based on your personal taste on waifus so I won't go in there."

OreGairuSNAFU,3d4drf,worriedgirl1796,-5,Mon Jul 13 14:17:44 2015 UTC,"At what point did this story go from helping Hachiman get over his weird teenage years to everyone falling over Yukino?   I mean I am still holding out hope that she won't win in the end, but it is clear that is where this story is going to go, and it feels kind of lackluster because of that. Unless Watari is going to delve into her past and show us why Yukino is so backwards, and messed up then I don't get the point of why everyone is helping Yukino. Maybe then I will like Yukino. On a similar note I disliked Hanekawa in the Monogatari series until we learned her story too, but right now Yukino is very boring and something needs to happen with her development.   My guess is the final volumes of the novel will all be Yukino-centered, we learn of what happened to her to make her be this way, she has a breakthrough and finally confesses to Hachiman. End series."
OreGairuSNAFU,3d4drf,DarkWorld97,3,Mon Jul 13 17:11:51 2015 UTC,"Or no one confesses and they all live with he regret of not taking the next step. Yukino realizes she doesn't really love Hachiman, Yui goes onto college and become a teacher, and finally, Hachiman and Saika get it on. Perfect end."
OreGairuSNAFU,3d4drf,Fruitsy,2,Mon Jul 13 21:41:53 2015 UTC,Well Oregairu has been basically Yukino's story since Volume 6 so the final volumes being Yuki centric isnt at all surprising

OreGairuSNAFU,3d065s,Yamigosaya,3,Sun Jul 12 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"Most: Iroha and Hayato. It's very rare to see, in a lovecome, supporting characters becoming so relevant to the point of almost earning the title of main characters.  Least: Zaimokuza, Saika and Saki. The only charm in their characters is their personalities but apart from that they have nothing else. They're constantly used purely for comedy relief, their words and actions hardly make any relevance or add development to the story and when they do something relevant, it can be cast aside as plot device because of how it feels like if their characters were used as an excuse to explain how things went so smoothly for Hachiman."

A similar idea holds for Haruno, whom I never understood the hate for, since she is trying to help her sister and is sassy to boot. Komachi was important for Hikki to have someone to ""help"" to come to the episode 8 conclusion, plus is the best wingwoman still. And Iroha is not a supporting characterI refuse to listen to any words otherwise (hell if there were anyway for Iroha x Hachima + Yui x Yukino that was not a complete farce I'd love it hahaha).  Zaimokuza... I'd probs say least improved, since as far as I can tell nothing goes on with him."

OreGairuSNAFU,3cz7g2,wardaniel9,3,Sun Jul 12 03:08:16 2015 UTC,The chances for a season 3 are pretty low because there will most likely only be about 2 novels left in the series. At best we might get an OVA or a movie.
OreGairuSNAFU,3cz7g2,comunistponyz,2,Sun Jul 12 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"you don't think they will go on their own direction, something like FMA.... then once the LN is out maybe make a movie or OVA..."
OreGairuSNAFU,3cz7g2,wardaniel9,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:14:10 2015 UTC,"Thats unlikely. The anime was mainly to promote the ln (which most adaptations are for). Its rare for an adaptation to go past the source like FMA did and FMA was also a long running anime iirc which also changes what can be done with it. The only anime I know of that has done that is the Chu2 series which is a pretty heavy outlier as far as I know.   Though that being said, a Season 3 isn't 100% out of the question but it is highly unlikely that we'll get to see one.  At this point I think most fans are hoping for either a movie or at least ab OVA series."
OreGairuSNAFU,3cz7g2,FrozenFyre,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:57:47 2015 UTC,"FMA was a pretty unique situation.  It got its adaptation at such an early point in the manga's run that they rapidly overtook the source material and had to either go anime-original and capitalize on the hype-train while it was still rolling or wait for the manga to get ahead and risk losing its audience.  Here, on the other hand, the series was already at its halfway point when it got it's anime adaptation.  It might have made sense to go anime-original after season 1, but the fact that they were working closely enough with the author to animate then-unreleased material indicates what direction they've chosen to go with it.  At this point virtually everybody has committed to seeing it through to the end, so it's not like they risk losing their audience the way they might have if the series was a ratings sensation two years ago with no new material to work on."
OreGairuSNAFU,3cz7g2,socalso,2,Sun Jul 12 08:48:49 2015 UTC,"Nope. The anime ended right where the LN did and the author, Watari, wrote in his notes that the novel is ending soon. It took 5 & 6 volumes to make season 1 and 2 respectively so the LN would have to make at least 4 more novels to get in the radar of the animation studios. However, as Watari said, we're at the end so I doubt we'll get more than 3 more volumes."
OreGairuSNAFU,3cwluk,pEuAsTsSy,4,Sat Jul 11 12:01:25 2015 UTC,"That's the online store website of Chiba's JPL baseball team ""Chiba Lotte Marines"".   They have a advertisting/promotional contract with the anime.  At a game on June 11th the three main voice actors of Oregairu announced the starting lineup and Hikigaya Hachiman’s voice actor Eguchi Takuya threw the ceremonial first pitch.  That was on youtube but sadly the takedown notices from TBS hit; but maybe you could find repost.  Anyway I hope some of that merchandise appears on sites that ship to the USA, T-Shirt looks awesome."

Edit: We've actually talked about this before on this sub a while back. My advice for people is to forget about it.  The aftermarket price may be too much and that's without shipping.

Only one story from 7.5 is animated which is the ova of season 1 but the other 2 arent.

If we take what hachiman said in Vol. 11 into consideration, it all makes perfect sense. Yukino is not older than Hachiman.

You'll get drive-by downvotes by people for any given reason and there's nothing you can do to make them stop.  The better metric for the success and value of your post is how many quality comments it generates.

Even a great community like this one has a few.  Nobody's raised any meaningful objection to your logic in the comments, so it's probably not even rooted in anything as stupid as a reflexive, kneejerk disagreement downvote."
OreGairuSNAFU,3cohpj,YukinoYukinoshita,2,Thu Jul 9 22:42:57 2015 UTC,Probably because your post has Isshiki on it. I know some people who downvote threads because the main topic is a waifu they personally dislike. Things like that are real in this subreddit. Believe it.

OreGairuSNAFU,3cohpj,paladinmahdi,3,Sat Jul 11 15:23:51 2015 UTC,Wait does that mean she skipped a grade? Since she was born the year after hachiman?
OreGairuSNAFU,3cohpj,turt547,8,Thu Jul 9 16:55:48 2015 UTC,Japanese school year is different starts from April so if you your birthday is before that but after April of the previous year you would be in the same year. So people that are born in January-march are actually the youngest for their year. Which further the idea of a Yukino ending because we all know Hachiman like younger girls XD

OreGairuSNAFU,3co0yy,pEuAsTsSy,6,Thu Jul 9 12:57:11 2015 UTC,"It looks like the anime cut many interactions and dialogue between the group when they were in the club. Good thing I read the L.Ns   Isshiki’s really only about eight months away from me and three months from Yukinoshita.   Wait a moment, so if Isshiki's is younger than Hachiman by 8 months, how's Yukino older than Hikki if she's older than Ishiki by 3 months ? So that means Yukino is younger than Hachiman, not older."
OreGairuSNAFU,3co0yy,atenthirtyone,2,Thu Jul 9 12:19:18 2015 UTC,"That's just the date, not the year. Yukino is born January 3 of year x, Hachiman is August 8 of year x, and Iroha is April 16 of year x+1.  Hachiman was talking strictly date for birthdays.  Source: http://yahari.wikia.com/"

OreGairuSNAFU,3co0yy,pEuAsTsSy,3,Thu Jul 9 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"Let's say Hachiman was born in August of 1995, it would make sense that he's eight months older than Iroha, who would be born in April of 1996, and since Yukino is in the same year as Hachiman and is three months older than Iroha, that would make her being born in January of 1996 (and 5 months younger than Hachiman).  Years used are only for example, they're not officialy stated. We only have dates:   Yukino : January 3rd Hachiman: August 8th Iroha: April 16th"
OreGairuSNAFU,3co0yy,RalphZiggy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:39:55 2015 UTC,"Well that's exactly what I meant in my original comment, before reading this chapter, I thought she was older, Here in this post were discussing the age of the characters and they were saying she's older"
OreGairuSNAFU,3ciost,ScrandyUser,11,Wed Jul 8 05:28:12 2015 UTC,"... Like Yukinon said, you might want to download the translated light novels before they get taken down, as Yen Press has licensed the series for an English translation and they won't be able to be web hosted much longer. As for the most recent volumes, Spyro from Kyakka is based and working on volume 11 because he's a legend (Volume 11 supposedly ends at the same time as episode 13 of the anime). So yea, google Kyakka."

OreGairuSNAFU,3ciost,FrozenFyre,3,Sat Jul 11 07:17:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's likely that there isn't going to be a 3rd season due to lack of content. Though if it'll get animated in an OVA series or something no one can say for sure.   The thing to note is that the end of season 2 is the end of volume 11 of the light novels, and volume 11 is the newest one which was released close to the end of the anime.   So now your choices would be to either sit and wait for the new volume to come out (if you don't want to reread the whole story) though no one knows when that'll be released, or you can read all the light novels that are already out. You could also wait a couple years to see if anything will get animated but chances are slim and you probably wouldn't want to do that anyways I'd assume.  I'd recommend reading the light novels (and most of the sub would) since theres a lot of things that the anime skipped out on that make the series a lot more enjoyable than it already is."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ciost,wuulala,2,Wed Jul 8 06:15:39 2015 UTC,yeah I might as well read the light novels especially if most of the sub would agree
OreGairuSNAFU,3ciost,FrozenFyre,5,Wed Jul 8 06:28:19 2015 UTC,"An alternative would be to download them now ( in case it got taken off ) then take a break of weeks or months before you read them as the anime follows the LN pretty closely, minus the monologues and extra content( small events) in volume x.5s. This is because of you just finished marathoning the show, it would feel quite repetitive now and that might put you off."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ciost,otaku_platypus,2,Wed Jul 8 13:40:21 2015 UTC,It's a good read! I had few close to sleepless nights because I couldn't stop reading. If you enjoyed the anime I'm sure you'll enjoy the light novels even more. Have fun! :)
OreGairuSNAFU,3ciost,Moonhowler22,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:31:59 2015 UTC,though no one knows when that'll be released   A new volume comes out approximately every 4 months. So volume 12 (or another bonus volume maybe) will probably come out in november.

You can also drop by /r/AnimeFigures. They're a friendly and helpful community which can give you good advice in case this is your first ever figure purchase. There are also a lot of useful links on their sidebar.  My recommended stores are Hobby Search , Ami Ami, and of course the official Kotobukyia US link, JP link. I don't see them for sale on the EU website.   Personal Bias incoming, you can ignore.   My own favorite and where I bought most of my stuff is AmiAmi.  AmiAmi Yukino   AmiAmi Yui 7/8 PO's open again!   Good: discount, careful packaging makes sure you'll get it intact. Bad: shipping is a bit more expensive because of the bulky packaging.   WARNING Do not buy them on impulse!!! Think carefully before you do so. You can read the buyfag guide. For collectors this is a serious and sometimes quite expensive hobby, so make sure you have enough cash on the side.  SECOND WARNING Kotobukyia or other websites may put up an offer with both figures as a set, possibly with a discount. If you're patient enough, perhaps you can get both of them at once. I wasn't though  Edit: Since this is a popular series don't take what I said in this second warning for granted. They may run out of stock before they try and make this kind of a deal.  THIRD WARNING Careful of Bootlegs!!! If it's too cheap to be true, it's fake. Stick to the official websites. /r/AnimeFigures also has bootleg megathreads.   Oh, and of course, if you have a MFC account, feel free to add me as a friend.  Cheers!  EDIT 2: Thanks /u/ Enigmaboob for the links!

You can also try some of the other recommended websites from MFC. Read customer reviews carefully.  She's up for PO's again on AmiAmi!

OreGairuSNAFU,3ce7nq,CaptainFalconProblem,3,Tue Jul 7 05:40:10 2015 UTC,They force people to take down existing translations and it'll take them fucking forever to reach where we are now.  Who knows? Probably can if he feels like it but he seems pretty demotivated to do anything right now so he might drop the project altogether. I have faith in him though!

OreGairuSNAFU,3ce7nq,AnimeFreakXP,3,Tue Jul 7 10:51:29 2015 UTC,Spyro might be able to pump out volume 11 before he gets forced to take down his translations. That's iffy though. He would need the motivation to finish it up with the knowledge that he may be forced to take it down in at any given moment.  Volume 12 seems like it would be a dream though.
OreGairuSNAFU,3ce7nq,haugao,2,Tue Jul 7 06:00:01 2015 UTC,"All the stuff about C&D being said, there are numerous ways for Spyro to get around that. There are plenty of scanlators who go about their business even after a series gets licensed and they get cease and desist letters.  Of course, since the LN translation community is much smaller, we're more likely to see people getting takedown requests.  Incidentally, Yen Press can't do shit if his website is hosted in a country they're not in.  (Personal experience, our scanlation group caught the attention of Shueisha. Chapters were removed from batoto but that did basically nothing to us. We still scanlate each and every week and plan to until the series ends)"
OreGairuSNAFU,3ce7nq,Sakata_Kintoki,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:53:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty much Yen Press will want to maximize their profits. How do they do this? They get rid of all the fan translations so that everyone will be forced to buy their translations. So the chances of Spyro getting a Cease and Desist letter to stop his work has gone up significantly. This includes all other fan translators of Oregairu.  Further more since they picked up the series now instead of picking it up after the series has ended, it will take a long  time for non-Japanese fans to get closure. So its estimated that Volume 12 will be released officially by Yen Press around 2019-2020 or longer.   This also means this sub reddit will be dying soon. Since the fan translations of volume 11 and upcoming LN 12 was the one thing this sub was looking for. Getting this news is devastating."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ce7nq,GotoSenpai,2,Tue Jul 7 05:57:20 2015 UTC,"I am rather ignorant to the details and apologize if I'm coming across as insolent, but why does this affect Spyro?   Now, as I understand it, Spyro was doing these for free on his own time I assume for his love of the series and wanting to share the series with fans, not out of profit right? Nothing Yen Press can do can stop him  even if they took down his site right?   Thanks for the response!"
OreGairuSNAFU,3ce7nq,GotoSenpai,2,Tue Jul 7 06:09:18 2015 UTC,I don't know the full details so i'm not 100% accurate. But from my understanding its all basically copyright/licensing.   But it affects Spyro because basically Yen Press has every right to give a C&D to Spyro to stop all his translations of Oregairu. It's like giving part ownership to Yen Press in a sense.   Edit: It does not matter is Spyro did it for free or was making profit off of it. Its all about how Yen Press can maximize their profits as a company and if it means taking away closure for non-Japanese fans by taking away fan translations then they will do such.

OreGairuSNAFU,3cddb2,AeroSkyline,5,Tue Jul 7 01:17:59 2015 UTC,"/u/Jimmy314/ is right. If you check the page on Kyakka, you'll notice that only Chapter 1 of 6.5 and the drama CD that came with it have been translated there. According to the Oregairu wiki, 6.5 contains 10 chapters in total. A quick Google search for translations of 6.5 yielded no immediate results, which leads me to believe that Volume 6.5 hasn't been translated in its entirety. It seems the only part available is the first chapter on Kyakka. What /u/Jimmy314/ is most likely seeing in the PDFs and EPUBs is the translation of the drama CD that came with 6.5, rather than the volume itself. I checked the PDF and EPUB versions that I have, and they seem to match exactly with the translation of the drama CD on Kyakka, which is a Christmas story. It seems that someone used the translation of the drama CD, branded it as volume 6.5, and had it circulate from there. Looks like every PDF/EPUB of 6.5 is actually the drama CD and 6.5 hasn't actually been completely translated."
OreGairuSNAFU,3cddb2,Varzakh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:05:41 2015 UTC,Ohh. I wasn't paying too much attention since I haven't gotten that far in the Light Novels yet. Thanks for the clarification!
OreGairuSNAFU,3cddb2,AeroSkyline,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"No worries! I'm also getting caught up on the light novels, so finding out that volume 6.5 hasn't been translated is an inconvenience, but it's good to know."
OreGairuSNAFU,3cddb2,Varzakh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:04:30 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah. I just downloaded all of the LN volumes in case Spyro's translations are going to be taken down, but I haven't gotten a chance to thoroughly look at them yet.   Has there been any news from Spyro or any other translators regarding Volume 6.5? Like you said, the PDF and EPUB versions of 6.5 I've seen are the drama CD, so I'm curious as to whether or not it'll be translated in the near future. Hopefully Spyro doesn't get taken down!"
OreGairuSNAFU,3cddb2,AeroSkyline,2,Tue Jul 7 04:17:17 2015 UTC,"It seems that while Spyro translated the drama CD last year, he only put up chapter 1 of 6.5 last month. My guess is that he was working on translating 6.5 when some stuff got in the way. By the time he had time to do some more translating, volume 11 had already come out, and he switched his efforts to that instead. This is speculation, but it seems like the most likely possibility. With this whole Yen Press fiasco now, it's hard to say whether he'll bother to go on translating.  EDIT: Never mind,, it looks like Spyro will be continuing to translate. That being said, volume 11 is probably his top priority right now, so we likely shouldn't expect the rest of 6.5 until after that's done."

OreGairuSNAFU,3cddb2,AeroSkyline,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:15:16 2015 UTC,6.5 is actually just a collection of 6.25-6.75 which came out with blue ray/dvd releases then they put them into one book and then the author added the bouns track i think which is why it came out after volume 9 even tho everything outside the bouns track is before volume 9. The volume outside the bouns track was just episode 13 of season 1 more or less from what i heard.

OreGairuSNAFU,3c80cb,Lonaticus,5,Mon Jul 6 06:30:26 2015 UTC,"Well, one way to find out is wait till the blu-rays are out. Reading the subtitles can give a hint as to how far localization will go.

OreGairuSNAFU,3c80cb,GranZero,11,Sun Jul 5 19:57:05 2015 UTC,Typically fan translations have to stop once a series has been licensed. Baka Tsuki for licensed series does this to some extent
OreGairuSNAFU,3c80cb,wowthatscooliguess,4,Sun Jul 5 19:59:06 2015 UTC,"Because they will force the fan translators to take their translations from the internet and they will take forever to translate the L.Ns, vol 1 = 2016, guess when volume 12."
OreGairuSNAFU,3c80cb,GranZero,3,Sun Jul 5 19:59:10 2015 UTC,An official localization usually comes with a cease and desist order to fan translation sites of the latest LN volumes.  This means that Kyakka or NanoDesu will have to remove their translated work from their sites
OreGairuSNAFU,3c80cb,doominator10,3,Sun Jul 5 20:00:24 2015 UTC,Time to download epubs for Volumes 1-10.5
OreGairuSNAFU,3c80cb,Moises-delamroa,3,Sun Jul 5 20:03:06 2015 UTC,"Well, if it's any consolation it's volumes 1 and 7 that are at most risk of being removed.   Volume 1 because it'll be the first to be localized; volume 7 because only BakaTsuki has its translation and when publishers send C&Ds to sites, BT usually takes out all of the translated work from their site.  Worst case scenario is if all translations are taken out before 2016 comes."
OreGairuSNAFU,3c80cb,iskow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"Nanodesu also receives C&D, I believe? So volumes 1-4.  Kyakka is also listed on BT, so unless they don't do their job properly, spyro will probably receive a c&d as well."

I'm not sure how Frog-kun and Spyro will respond, but I do know that BT removes all work for the whole series when a localization is announced.  I have 2 wishes though:  1) for YenPress to preserve the numerous references in its localization  2) if the fan translations are to be taken down, I hope they're taken down on a per-volume basis (remove V1 when V1 is localized, but V2+ fan translations will remain up, etc.)"

They want to maximise their possible sales, even if it means stopping non Japanese fans from getting closure for 4/5 years."

If it takes years and years to get all of them translated, then fuck it, I'd rather just forget and move on. I'm used to waiting for the next X(asoiaf,kingkiller,SA) novel for years, but this? Oregairu is great, it's an awesome LN, it proved to me that even a crappy medium can throw out a gem or two, but to wait years for one, (with what? 300 pages of content? 4 hrs worth of reading time? >>)... I don't mind paying, but waiting is going to kill it for me. If Spyro doesn't continue to translate the LN, then that's that. It was great, it was fun, it would have been nice to be current and discuss all the interesting things in the LN, outside of One piece this was the only other fandom I could say I was a part of, losing this is gonna suck. Well, adios guys, we had a good run."

OreGairuSNAFU,3bvhco,pEuAsTsSy,5,Thu Jul 2 14:10:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, very great read. Can't wait for part 2 so I can let loose some of my thoughts.   Yui did say cookies are only a thanks. After rewatching the last scene multiple times, I concluded that I could even look at them as thanks for making up with her, being there all the time, and even as a ""goodbye"".   This hit me harder than it should have. After reading how everyone thinks the cookies were her way of showing her feelings for 8man in a ""physical"" form, what you said here gave me a new perspective.   But the whole Yukino x 8man thing, I do have to agree with what LadWatcherIsHere said.    I also can't rest the feelings that her new found love for Hachiman is her confusing her new found dependency on him.    Is it really love she is feeling for 8man? Or does she only have feelings for him because she switched her dependency issues to him? This alone makes me think we will have a ""loner"" type ending where 8man is left with nothing. I believe that once Yukino becomes independent she will have nothing but a friendly interest in 8man.   Could Yukino's dependency issues being mistaken for love/feelings for 8man be considered as ""An illusion/deceit"" as well? Which goes against something genuine?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bvhco,GotoSenpai,3,Thu Jul 2 18:43:32 2015 UTC,"This is what Yukino needs to grow from. Yui had initially wanted to give the cookies to 8man because he saved her dog. Nothing romantic really. But after getting to know him, getting to understand him, and be with him, she realized that she had romantic feelings for him. Her courtesy cookies became the physical manifestation of her genuine romantic feelings. Now with Yukino, she needs to learn to stand on her own. Her feelings for 8man could very well be a facade, as she views him as something to attain. But, after growing from her dependency issue, she may still love him. Everyone needs to someone to lean on. 8man has shown time and time again that he wants people to lean on him. He wants friends. He has also shown clear interest in Yukino, what with all the blushing and staring they do. He also realizes that she needs to stand on her own, but he wants to be there to help her. All in all, all our protagonists need to grow emotionally in order to even think about being in a romantic relationship. If 8man x Yukino happens now, it will only lead to pain."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bvhco,DarkWorld97,3,Thu Jul 2 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"I do agree with Haruno playing the villain, especially how quickly she caught onto what Hachiman was doing during the festival meetings. I think she just really wants to see her Yukino-chan blossom into her own person, especially since she's caught onto the fact that Yukino does have feelings for Hachiman. She called her out on her chocolate being for somebody in particular, and called that bullshit joint-chocolate-taste-testing-instead-of-directly-giving exactly what it was. She's playing it safe and is unwilling to do anything to disrupt her current superficial relationship with Hachiman. Hell, I think Haruno might be the biggest Hachiman/Yukino shipper out there.   Hey, that was from my Haruno = Batman ""essay"" on /r/anime! Senpai noticed me!"

Excellent point,  this the first time I saw someone mention this,  most people hate yukino and keep saying she's a bitch or bad character,  while Yui the pure girl that always suffers,  comparing Yukino's shitty life and suffering with Yuis, it seems too insignificant (Im not hating on Yui)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bvhco,MK1412,4,Thu Jul 2 16:35:04 2015 UTC,"Excellent point, this the first time I saw someone mention this   That just hit me after looking for parallels which I've planned for the second part of this post, and I simply had to put it into words. Glad you like my thoughts on this.   I'm not hating on Yui   Me neither."

OreGairuSNAFU,3bvhco,LadWatcherIsHere,4,Sat Jul 4 15:10:18 2015 UTC,"This is very spot on but I can't rest the feeling that it's based a lot on the idea of pairing Hachiman and Yukino, especially for this phrase:   However, if she truly did play dirty as she claims, then she doesn't deserve Hachiman.   So what? Playing dirty is part of being people. Yukino almost did something similar when she initially rejected Hachiman's request for reasons that contradicted what she's been doing so far. And Hachiman himself is a very cruel person. If playing dirty is all it takes for the trio to consider that the other isn't worthy then those feelings were an illusion from the beginning.  And of course Yukino suffers a lot more than any other character but that doesn't mean the story should focus on making her happy. Plus she had 10 volumes to change, had Haruno to scold her and tell her every single time: Do something for yourself for once Yukino-chan, had Hachiman doing the entire work despite this is a contest, had Yui playing dirty to move things and keep everyone together and all Yukino did was just sit there and watch.  I also can't rest the feelings that her new found love for Hachiman is her confusing her new found dependency on him. She's not chasing after Haruno's shadow anymore... but now she's chasing Hachiman's instead. She hasn't changed at all. I feel the focus on the next Volume will be that. To have Yukino change for once finally! Instead of depending on people, instead of having her friends always moving her with words, instead of just sitting there and watch, just have her do something for once. Having her end up with Hachiman as a climax for her character development would be a mistake because it wouldn't make a difference for Yukino, she would fall again in her dependency cycle.  ...  I think I'll write my own thread about it."

OreGairuSNAFU,3byogl,SKxP,2,Fri Jul 3 06:06:30 2015 UTC,"Wow so many questions! Actually the first two questions that you asked are linked. Both yukino and hayato said they hated the way Hachiman did things. So how does Hachiman go about doing things? By trampling over the feelings of others. To be a cold ""heartless"" monster that seeks the most effective method at the expense of others' feelings. It was Yui I believe who first voiced this out at the end of S2EP2.  Yui ""You should think more about other's feelings...""  Both times, Hachiman played the role of the maytr who carried others' wishes.  Whose feelings did he trample over? Not just his own, but his friends and also Sagami (in S1) and Tobe et. al (in S2) For the case of Sagami, did she deserve that harsh verbal abuse? Probably, maybe. I think Hachiman did it so that he could become the scapegoat when Sagami was unable to put together a coherent speech, which would be the case even if Hachiman did not do anything. Regardless, that verbal abuse had a sharp emotional impact on Sagami. Next him and his friends. I think sensei put it quite well. ""Even if you are used to the hurt, you should realize that there are others who hurt because they see you hurt.""  In season 2, he did the same. How would you feel if some dude just ran up and confessed to a girl you like just as you mustered up the courage to do so? As for Yukinoshita and Yui, it's the pain of seeing Hachiman get confessed and get rejected. Especially so for Yui, she likes Hachiman remember?  And lastly, Hachiman disregarding his own feelings. Do you really think he doesn't give a f*** each time he pulls a stunt like that? :D Once again, I quote,"" Even if you are used to the pain..."" Others could probably elaborate on this more but I am using mobile so I shall stop at this. TL;DR for sensei's speech, What his problems are and why they exist. What he wants and how to get there.  Iroha, overheard Hachimans genuine speech and was moved. As she explained, she decided to take a step forward that is to attempt to confess to Hayato. Since it was Hachiman which prompted her to take said step, it is his fault and thus ""take responsibility"".  Hachiman genuine speech actually only consists of 4 words haha. I want something genuine. Everything else is his internal monologue.  He wants something real from all of them. He wants them to be true to each other, to show their true nature, the good and the bad to each other. But that is impossible and he knows it.  yukinoshita ran out because she was unsure of how to react when Hachiman broke down and cried in front of them. I guess."
OreGairuSNAFU,3byogl,FatFluffyFish,2,Fri Jul 3 07:40:23 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply! A lot of what I assumed was right but of course I just had to make sure.
OreGairuSNAFU,3byogl,LadWatcherIsHere,4,Fri Jul 3 07:47:13 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, I want to believe that you're a young person, maybe a pre-teen? Because your questions are incredibly stupid. If you don't know the answers then why did you watch the anime for? As far as I can tell, you didn't get a single thing of what transcurred during the entire series. But I'll help you out anyway. Here goes:   The thing about Hayato being angry and the confession scene is because both Hayato and Yukino dislike Hachiman's methods to solve things. He basically labels himself as the villain to bring everyone together against him. Thanks to that, the hate that would fall on Sagami fell on Hachiman instead and the superficial relationship of Hayato's clique was saved by Hachiman's confession. Hayato dislikes how Hachiman sacrifices himself because he believes that since he's not loved by anyone then having him suffering at the end wouldn't make anyone sad, it's a happy ending. Hayato doesn't believe this, he knows there are people who will value Hachiman and that's what makes him mad. As for Yukino, Hachiman went against his own ideals right there and that's mostly what pissed her off too.  Iroha confessed her feelings to Hayato because Hachiman's genuine speech moved her. She started to believe that if she truly believes that if she does her best and keeps believing then everything will surely go as she wants it. It didn't. She got rejected instead and it was because of Hachiman's influence. That's why she puts the blame on him and asks him to take responsibility.  Sensei was trying to convince Hachiman to view things with feelings rather than logic. Hachiman's problem is that he locked away his own feelings and to him, everyone is an enemy he must treat carefully because you don't know when they will stab you in the back. Because of this, he can't find a logical reason of why he saved the Service Club by preventing Yukino and Yui from becoming the school presidents. Sensei basically told him: Because you care for them and don't want to lose them.  Here's Hachiman full speech:   It's not empty words I'm after. There was something else I desired all along. Not mutual understanding, friendship, companionship or anything of the sort. I don't care about being understood. I simply wish to understand. Understand, know and rest in ease in that knowledge- gain some peace of mind. I want to know people inside-out because being in the dark terrifies me. It's an awfully self-indulgent, egotistic and arrogant wish. It's downright despicable and disgusting. Having a desire like that makes me sick to the stomach! But if it's at all possible to share that desire- if it's possible to have relationship where you're free to burden one another with that repulsive self-gratificacion. I know that it's out of the question! I know it's out of my reach! Even so... I want something genuine.  If you can't understand that just by reading it then you're a lost case. And Yukino ran out because she couldn't find logic in his words. She couldn't understand and not understanding anything that just happened scared the hell out of her resulting in her doing the most common and logical thing a person does in that kind of situation: Run away."
OreGairuSNAFU,3byogl,LadWatcherIsHere,-4,Fri Jul 3 07:14:38 2015 UTC,Thanks I understand now. Welp I knew the way I worded this would lead to people assuming I knew nothing of what happened so I'm not offended by your rude comments. Thank you for your time.

OreGairuSNAFU,3bul3c,LadWatcherIsHere,7,Thu Jul 2 07:32:09 2015 UTC,"It's not. He never said it was the final one. He just said it's the climax and see you at volume 12 (12巻でお会いしましょう). Most of the afterword is just gibberish. That's why I didn't bother translating the whole thing.   It won't be the last one. Remember, this is a person who really hates how regular LN series are done, and a rushed ending may be the thing he hates the most.  Let's have more faith in him, shall we?  Anyway, thanks for the full TL OP. Hopefully this will calm down people a bit."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bul3c,Lonaticus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:28:44 2015 UTC,"Climax means the tip of the iceberg, the final scene, the place where all things gather in one place and end. If the climax of the story is not the end then Volume 13 would most likely be an entire epilogue. That's how it works.  And you're welcome. I have faith in him but if he openly tells me that, I have nothing else but to believe him."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bul3c,LadWatcherIsHere,3,Thu Jul 2 08:30:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think this series could easily go up to 14 volumes. Assuming the climax happens between the middle and the end of volume 12 (as has been the trend so far), there would still need to be time for the loose ends to be patched up before the final resolution.  For reference, here's a typical plot chart that you may or may not be familiar with."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bul3c,AeroSkyline,2,Thu Jul 2 16:33:07 2015 UTC,Yep. Anime and LN mediums seem to have forgotten how to write proper epilogues. The only exception I can think of recently is the UBW finale.

OreGairuSNAFU,3bug3c,Markaleto,8,Thu Jul 2 06:23:53 2015 UTC,"The Genuine speech must definitely. That was the turning point. Take notice on how Yukino always left clues and hints whenever she talked to Hachiman about herself but during their trip to Disneyland, that was the first time she openly talked about herself. You can also notice a tender tone in her voice contrasting her usually professional demeanor.  We can't know for sure how she developed her feelings for him since it all happens from Hachiman's POV and there is never a single moment where she openly shows interest that we can know of because we had yet to see that new side of her which we met after the Genuine speech but we do know that she started to accept his ideals instead of countering them and even became conflicted with herself, to the point she (sort of) accepted that she wasn't going to change, during this currently season. Hachiman came in and changed that. It must have come as a shock for her to see the person she had thought a monster of logic breaking down in front of her and talking from the heart. That's the moment she truly breaks in the series. And something out of the comfort zone can mean great changes. In this case, it caused her to fall in love with him."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bug3c,LadWatcherIsHere,6,Thu Jul 2 07:23:31 2015 UTC,"I feel as if this was the moment that solidified her romantic interest in him. She probably viewed as reliable, trustworthy, and enjoyable to be around prior to the genuine speech, but this was at a time when she knew no love. Not from her family, not from Hayama (presumed), not from anybody. The Genuine Speech, to me at least, was a catalyst of sorts. It sort of woke her up and made her realize that she did have a romantic interest. No whether or not these feelings will persist to the ending is all up to Watari, and how he decides to ruin us."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bug3c,DarkWorld97,6,Thu Jul 2 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"As early as episode 1, remember how 8man tried to be friend with Yukino but she refuses? She just did not want to get into friendzone."

I don't think she understands her feelings yet, I might be wrong."

I think it'll be lot harder for it to get licensed once it's over, so it's not something I have high hopes for. I wish it'd get licensed though."
OreGairuSNAFU,3btwxj,turt547,2,Thu Jul 2 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"Please no. They will just forcefully remove fanTL's. With their slow release date, by the time they reach Vol 12 people will have forgotten about this series. They have a release schedule of 2 volumes per year on other stuff.   Just ask around to see how many people have read or still remember Haruhi and Spice and Wolf, the latest novels. I don't mean the old S3 when meme, but the actual LN's. FYI Spice and Wolf last volume in English will be released this autumn.  So I'd say no. Not at least until the original work is done."
OreGairuSNAFU,3btwxj,Lonaticus,2,Thu Jul 2 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"hmm thats actually a good point. I always wanted for the ln to be licensed but never thought about fanTL's being taken down. Although I feel that Oregairu is popular enough to still have fanTL's even after licensing (kind of like how SAO has I think 2 different translator groups still translating the lns even though its licensed).  Though that being said, I'd rather not take the risk of Spyro stopping partway. Hopefully it'll get licensed AFTER the series is over or something though.

OreGairuSNAFU,3btwxj,A_somebody,2,Sun Jul 5 10:02:56 2015 UTC,"The further I read into the volumes the more unlikely this series will be licensed, mainly because of the ton of references an average reader has to know. (other manga, anime, light novel series, Japanese references, Chiba, etc.)  If you're reading NanoDesu/Kyakka's translations then you would have most likely checked a reference at the bottom of the page or two at one point.  If it ever gets licensed, I wish it was after the last volume has been translated. I'd love to support Watari on this great work and buy the whole series."
OreGairuSNAFU,3btwxj,GranZero,2,Thu Jul 2 13:56:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I get a a bit lost sometimes with all the dank memes but I still find enjoyment in the social/psychological dialogue.

OreGairuSNAFU,3bt4k2,Enigmaboob,2,Wed Jul 1 23:39:27 2015 UTC,"I'd be really interested if you could expand (I don't know anything about Japan or its religions) on Shinto. The reason I thought of Zen Buddhism is that some of the monologues seemed to contain paraphrased Zen koans.   Anyway, thanks!"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bt4k2,Enigmaboob,2,Wed Jul 1 23:57:41 2015 UTC,"Mind telling me which monologues you're referring to? I won't blame you if you can't remember tho hahaha. Also, I'm going to reread the series soon, so I guess I could make a post about the Shinto stuff at some point."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bt4k2,Madagrey,2,Thu Jul 2 00:08:14 2015 UTC,"From Yukino's monologue where she is speaking of finding the genuine:   I won’t make the hopeful observation that those who were wrong should just face the same direction. It’s because it isn’t difficult to imagine that I would be the only one looking in the direction away from theirs.   I think this might be referencing the Zen koan describing the goal of Zen, or how one goes about finding the truth in the Zen practice, which is ""if you face it, it goes away"".  Yukino has no hope of finding the truth because she is always facing others no matter which way they are looking, even if she already knows they are wrong. In other words, she is all about her attachment to another."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bt4k2,RalphZiggy,3,Thu Jul 2 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"Posts like these are why I love this show and the community. What other recently aired show has this level of depth in discussion and is based on a light novel?! It's especially impressive considering the source material is a light novel series.  But as for your actual post, I love how you relate their story to that of a Zen master and how fitting it is to each character. I especially think the example of having no value or rank being Hachiman's defining character in the beginning is very fitting because it perfectly describes his ability to solve problems as a third party.  My question to you is that do you think Hachiman's true enlightenment (genuine relationship and ""zen"") will be more real than his fake enlightenment? Because you yourself have said how Hachiman never intended to be this way, it just ended like that. in a way, Hachiman's ""fake enlightenment"" could be more revealing than his true enlightenment because he may have to fight against himself to achieve genuinity. In Hachiman's fake state of zen master, he is able to remove his own value in dealing with people, so it could ultimately be more useful or true to himself than a genuine Hachiman could be.  ""In an attempt to be real, does the fake not obtain more value than the real?"" is a nice quote from Kaiki that I liked and is relevant."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bt4k2,darcy-san,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:13:28 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks!  I think that the idea of Hachiman as accidental-Zen-Master is only descriptive of why he's been successful in his escapades and why he's inspired Yui and Yukino to such an extent. It doesn't work very well as a description of where he's at in his own journey; he's very flawed the way he is, but he is slowly getting better. It is most important to think that he doesn't have any answers, and he can't articulate what the genuine looks like or is - he really isn't a master at all - but he does know that the process of getting there is important and for once in his life he should try to do without logic entirely - that is key.  I think the quote from Kaiki is a beautiful message about empathy. Note the odd constuction from the perspective of the fake object. An (very) extreme example: Let's say there is someone who wants to be a perfect fake Adolph Hitler. In order to do this properly, he has to learn everything about him and even try as hard as he can to understand why he feels the way he does, and what happened in his life to make him feel that way. This can only be done by cultivating an extreme empathy with his subject; and in the end you'd have a person who had developed empathy even for Adolph Hitler. What would that fake man be like?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bsn4h,DarkWorld97,6,Wed Jul 1 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"whenever the light novel ends    Then there's nothing to promote which is the entire point of having an anime. The reason we even got a second season was to, you guessed it, promote the light novels."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bsn4h,guyofred,4,Wed Jul 1 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly this, most L.N adaptations don't even get that second season which we did get."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bsn4h,paladinmahdi,2,Wed Jul 1 21:33:13 2015 UTC,good to see that it's selling well.
OreGairuSNAFU,3bsn4h,John137,2,Wed Jul 1 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"Well this is impressive, and when people say there's no chance for a season 3(not enough materials for a full season), or a low chance for an OVA, not because they don't want one, we all really want one, but I guess we don't want to raise our expectation then get disappointed, e.g Spice and wolf season 3, Index season 3.   All I want one now to hibernate until volume 12 get released and translated."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bsn4h,paladinmahdi,2,Wed Jul 1 21:24:24 2015 UTC,"From Nov 2014 - May 2015 [6 months]  Onegairu sold 625k copies and ranks at number 1 the past 6 months.  Also at rank 9 it sold 250k copies. Short story collection whatever that is.  It makes logical sense to have a 3rd season.  The author simply said he was in the final stage which could mean anything. A lot of authors say they are in the last arc or stage and it goes on for a while.  In my opinion for Onegairu to finish nicely it has to address and solve everyone's problems besides the main cast of Hachiman, Yui, Yuki. Including all the support cast like Iroha, Ebina, Hayato and maybe even Haruna. The show stresses in trying to find the answers to everyone's problems. I feel like the show would be incomplete if Iroha still is a fox, Ebina still likes the status quo and Hayato still chooses to live up to what is expected of him and others.  Everyone's problem has the reoccurring theme of ""not being genuine"" in one way or another. Closure to the series means everyone has found their answer to how to be genuine."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bsn4h,Prideless07,5,Wed Jul 1 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"It makes logical sense to have a 3rd season.   Season 1 adapted  vol 1-6   Season 2 adapted vol 7-11  If the L.N ends at vol 12 or 13, there's no way a season 3 will happen, not enough material."

Even though most likely not as detailed as in the LN, Hayato's interaction with Hikigaya is the most intriguing to me. Season 2 has been a blast to me so far in showing how all the characters are just not some one dimensional cliches usually thrown around in High School themed RomCom. They are all shown to be surprisingly complex and ever changing."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,Ahazveroz,6,Wed Jul 1 10:01:49 2015 UTC,"I checked out a few episodes from Season 1 yesterday and was shocked how all three main characters did a complete 180 since the start of the series.

OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,paladinmahdi,2,Wed Jul 1 20:58:38 2015 UTC,"I left season 1 running the other day on one screen, while getting some work done. I noticed how much more confident and more importantly, decisive Yukino used to be in season 1. She was also way more confident with the big bad Haruno (shopping for Yui's present and culture festival) back then.  Now, look at her. She is a lot more friendly with nearly everyone (even outside of the Service Club and co.), but lost that decisiveness. There are the two scenes in season two that come to mind. First, look at the walk back from the midnight ramen snack with sensei. She stayed behind Hachiman, and felt the need to confirm which street to turn at. Yukino was hunched the entire time and worried like they were braving through a blizzard. The other scene or rather situation(s) is her interactions with Haruno. They went from the little sister disliking, but looking up to the older one to... something way more uncomfortable. Yukino just looks fucking frightened to be in the same room as Haruno now as opposed to ""Big sis, why are you being so nosy?"".  I think someone in this thread said it best. Yukino seems to have become more of an early season 1 Yui now. That confident straight back and doing that hand going through the long hair pose is gone. It's now a cringey cowering hunching pose for Yukino."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,atenthirtyone,2,Wed Jul 1 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"Continuing as a new post because on a mobile and didn't want to accidentally lose everything.   On the other hand, Yui definitely became more confident - taking a bit from both of her former loner friends. She doesn't just suggest what to do anymore, but actually pushes the group to do things. Unfortunately, it seems like she might be copying [at least mentally] from our boy, 8man's Dark Knight style a bit. She seems to be way more willing to hurt herself for others than before. Hell, she's willing to be the villain in the final episode by actually getting trio starting on what to do with their current situation."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,atenthirtyone,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"I fucking love that you brought up the Yukino/Haruno dynamic. In regards to how it has transformed over the course of the series, it seems that the more open Yukino becomes, the more influence Haruno wants to, but not necessarily can, exert over her. My personal theory is that now that Haruno is aware of Yukino changing/finding herself, she realizes she is losing her control over her sister and has become far more confrontational as a means of defense. ""I liked the old Yukino more."" This is because she could understand her actions (even though Haruno resented the fact that Yukino had barely any self to act upon) and was able to monitor her progress as a member of the Yukinoshita family (I'm hesitant to attribute this to the business orientation of the family unless it's expanded upon in the LNs). Now she must resort to Hikigaya for many things in order to get to her sister (8man is like a tool for her to find out what she's choosing to do in school, etc.)  I get off work soon, but this is a great discussion! I'll have to double check some stuff in the LN's as well."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,Enigmaboob,2,Wed Jul 1 16:32:48 2015 UTC,"I think Haruno ideally wants Yukino to be in-between what she was before the series and currently (as of Vol 11/Season 2). She wants Yukino to be decisive and be ""selfish"" [in the right moment], but at the same time, can have and develop relationships that she can depend on as well. I don't think Haruno wants to control Yukino per say, but definitely would not stand there and do nothing while her little sister develops into a co-dependent husk.   Like the audience, Haruno realizes that the openness that Yukino has been developing is at the cost of her own sense of self. Granted, that sense of self that Yukino had in the beginning of the series isn't her true self. Before the series, Yukino was just copying her sister. Now, she is copying a mixture of ""younger"" Yui and ""younger"" Hachiman. Yukino has developed social openness, but also the indecisiveness that Yui used to display a lot more. I feel she copied a lot less from Hachiman, although she copied a bit of Hachiman’s selflessness [and the bad parts that come along with it], as evident that Yukino was willingly to let Yui do what she wants in the season finale. Instead, Yukino has become depended on Hachiman for plans and “what to do now?”, such as copying Hachiman word for word with her phone conversation with Haruno in the last episode.  Tl;dr: Haruno is playing super rough and tough love so Yukino can be strong and decisive, but also not afraid to open up to friends like Yui and Hachiman. But it isn't perfect, because everyone in Oregairu is human [even our best imouto, Komachi]."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,atenthirtyone,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't get me wrong, I meant it more as Haruno wants to be in the know, as Yukino isn't known for being an open book in the first place, and not necessarily a control freak. Agree with you on Yukino latching unto the early ideals of Hachiman as well. I actually think Haruno is right in her approach to the situation, as she has known Yukino the best (or at least the old Yukino that is changing into someone else) and this direct method she has taken to using is the strongest/most effective for pushing Yukino."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,Enigmaboob,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:30:25 2015 UTC,"They broke through Yukino's shell like Sensai hoped they would, but her core self needs some confidence and direction now that the ice queen act is disappearing.  Of course Shizuka-sensai wants her to enjoy real friendship (and maybe love too) with Yui and Hachiman, and to decide what she wants rather than be crushed under expectations and disappointment of family."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,RalphZiggy,2,Wed Jul 1 20:11:36 2015 UTC,"It's a very simple thing. Yui wants to become closer and know each other better. And Hachiman wants to find a relationship where both parties can fully understand each other and rest at ease thanks to it because not knowing is terrifying.  What both are describing is how love works. Whether it's family, friendship or even the romantic meaning, at the end, it's all about wanting to understand each other. Human relationships are the main focus of this series and the MC is a loner thus making it easy to show off how simple things are yet how complex it can be.  Yui is smart, her grades might not be good but neither are Hachiman's and that's not something that defines how smart someone can be. As for mature, Yui can be childish at time but that's because she's an easy-going person in a setting full of loners and plain weird people. Actually, if we look at it from that POV, Yui is more mature than Hachiman and Yukinoshita together because she can understand herself very easily while these two took 10 volumes to realize how they truly felt."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,LadWatcherIsHere,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:06:35 2015 UTC,I think the similarity in what they say just shows how much each character has changed and grown. You see that in some ways Hachiman is beggining to act like Yui and vice versa. (Hachiman wants the trio to stay together while yui starts solving problems in her own way like Hikigaya used to)Each character in the trio and maybe even iroha can be seen changing in who they first were. Honestly the amount of character growth watari manages to put into this series is astounding and I don't understand how such a series fails to get a season 3.
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,YukinoYukinoshita,4,Wed Jul 1 09:26:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's kinda scary how subtle Yui's change to Hachiman is. Either because he always holds onto his ""Nice Girl"" notion and becomes oblivious to her change or That Yui is just really good at hiding her change. Whereas Yukino's change were shown clearly throughout season 1 and season 2 ever since she had hachiman in service club."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bqh6g,Ahazveroz,2,Wed Jul 1 10:05:33 2015 UTC,Well Yui's problems/needed development as a whole were less extreme than the other two so I'm not entirely surprised that it was subtle. Put it another way: early season Hachiman and especially Vol 11 Yukino were/are very far from their final forms.

OreGairuSNAFU,3bmftz,danbuter,26,Tue Jun 30 12:06:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think she deserves ""better""... I think she deserves to win because of all the kindness and respect and she has shown to 8man over the course of the series.  Some people claim Yui's feelings aren't as ""genuine"" as Yukino's, but I'd argue they're just as, if not more so, than her's - for all we know, Yukino's could be a side effect of her dependency problems. When she finally solves her problems, Yukino might not feel the same way anymore about 8man.   I also think 8man entering into a relationship with Yui would be great for his development, and better for the story overall - the guy who supposedly hates ""nice girls"" with every fiber of his being, ends up falling for one? And not the facetious, fake ""nice girl"" he describes, but one who is genuinely kind and loyal to a fault. That would be beautiful irony.   This isn't to say that I don't think Yukino (or even Iroha) deserve any less of a shot - so long as the ending keeps in tone/theme with the rest of the series, I'll be satisfied (maybe not happy, but satisfied). Even if that means a loner ending."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bmftz,AqueousCactus,7,Tue Jun 30 12:41:28 2015 UTC,"Going along with this, I also think 8man would grow more and more capable of showing his affection for Yui. He's already shown he can be caring, given how he treats Komachi. It might take him a while for him to fully give Yui his whole heart given the shit he's gone through, but I also believe if anyone can help him get to that point, it's Yui.   Just my two cents."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bmftz,shortofsane,14,Tue Jun 30 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"Who's ""better"" for her and who isn't really lies in the eye of the beholder. In the end, the best for her would be, whomever she's happiest with and that's something only the person/character themselves can tell. I believe Yui deserves her own happiness, because of what she offers to those around her. For her empathy, for seeing herself as cruel for wanting what she wants. For holding back, so that she doesn't have an advantage she deems unfair. She might not be genuinie or earnest all the time, but it's for the sake of those around her and not to put herself into a better position.  All I think I can tell right now is that it seems like Yui sees her own happiness with the service club and being with Hachiman. The latter one even more so, when you consider the amount of small things she does to spend more time with him, starting with something little as walking to the club room together with him and being upset when he goes ahead."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bmftz,elbowrocketto,4,Tue Jun 30 14:12:32 2015 UTC,"Which Hachiman? The loser from before or the current one? I'd say the current one is probably better for her than Hayato and the guys from his clique. And to be honest, yes, she deserves someone even better, but if she wants to go for that genuine thing Hachiman is the best choice for her right now. He wasn't though back when she fell for him, so I kind of see your point."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bmftz,ganatti,6,Tue Jun 30 17:42:45 2015 UTC,"Yui is an amazing girl. Part of me wants her to end with Hachiman because that is what she wants.  Assuming Hachiman does actually return her feelings (kinda hinted, but it might also be wishful thinking), I'd say he has not moved forward because he deems himself unworthy."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bmftz,txchr15,8,Tue Jun 30 12:29:10 2015 UTC,"Hachiman still needs to learn to love himself before he can reciprocate the feelings of others. Be it Yukino, Yui, Iroha, or Saki, Hachiman isn't mentally ready to love someone if he can't find value in himself."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bmftz,DarkWorld97,2,Tue Jun 30 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"But does Yui just want to be non-working housewife like her mother?  Maybe Hachiman wants something different;  I think he'd be happy as freelance writer with very irregular income while wife has steady job to keep the baseline expenses covered.  This is of course assuming a very traditional mindset on Yui's part, get the hubby while still in high school!"

Currently vol 11, which covers the last 2 episodes of the anime, is in the process of being translated. It's hard to say if a Season 3 will come or not since we don't know when it ends BUT chances are low since it does seem that the light novels are ending soon and there wouldn't be enough content for another full season.  To get to your main question though, the full LN is definitely worth reading. You get a lot more details into some scenes and theres a lot of good interactions/scenes that get fully cut out in the anime."

After all, Kawasaki is the female version of Hikki - a proud loner who pours all of her love onto her siblings.  But the thing that get me is that Kawasaki is the only character that causes Hikki to behave in a completely natural, non-self-conscious way. The way he speaks to her is so surprising at times (""Love ya, Kawasaki""!; ""Because I need it"".) that it seems almost out of character.

OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,sinisteran,10,Mon Jun 29 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"If we're going to have meaningful discussion, let's leave our shipping biases at the door and look at this as objectively as possible. From what I gather, the state of the core characters and their relationships are as follows:  Yukino: She has clearly has realized both her own and Yui's feelings for 8man. What we don't know is if these feelings are a side effect of her dependency on him or not - for all we know, they might be. I think she knows that in order find this answer, she needs to solve her dependency problem and then decide how she truly feels. Maybe once Yukino discovers her self-identity, she won't feel the same way about 8man anymore? Maybe she'll love him in a different way, either romantically or platonically (like how she loves Yui)?   Yui: Being the most emotionally mature and able to pick up the mood better than 8man and Yukino, she caught on to Yukino's current feelings and state of mind long before this episode/volume - probably before even Yukino did. She still harbors feelings for 8man as well, but also wants to keep Yukino as her best friend - as she said, she wants it all. She knows this isn't possible without someone getting hurt, so comes up with her plan to freeze their relationship as is, and toss romance aside to keep their flimsy friendship in place. She knows 8man will reject this, hence why she presents to plan in the first place - to get the obvious reaction out of him and force all three to act. She is also trying to get Yukino to reveal her feelings as well, albeit in an underhanded manner (which Yui is well aware of).   Hachiman: 8man is at a crossroads right now, with, as I see it, four paths in front of him - the two romantic paths (Yui/Yukino), the path Yui laid out (disingenuous frienship), and the loner path (everyone is hurt, but comes out stronger for it in the end). His feelings for both girls are obviously conflicted, and despite whatever confirmation bias towards your preferred ship may blind you, both are dead even after this episode/volume. He realizes Yui isn't the ""nice girl"" he blindly labeled her as (although she is still genuinely kind to a fault), and has come to recognize that there is a LOT more to her than her jovial personality and calming demeanor. He also finally put all the pieces together that she does truly love him as a person, not just out of pity. He realizes (again) that Yukino isn't some perfect goddess - she is fractured and needs help, but that help is what is breaking her in the first place. She is flawed just like the rest of us.   8man, ever the cynic, is sadly banking on the loner path. He says that he knows whatever follows will hurt and leave scars, but is okay with that because it was real."
OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,AqueousCactus,4,Mon Jun 29 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"I think she knows that in order find this answer, she needs to solve her dependency problem and then decide how she truly feels. Maybe once Yukino discovers her self-identity, she won't feel the same way about 8man anymore?    This is probably the biggest point most of the people focusing on details too subtle to make a difference and the puzzling dialogue seem to be ignoring. Looking at the relationships objectively and the way the characters have developed, Yukino is the individual the most backwards in terms of defining her relationships. Hachiman used to be almost, if not just as bad, but he has now opened his eyes and reassessed his view of the girls from the beginning of the series, and Yui has accepted how she feels and what Yukino and Hachiman are to her as well. Yukino still looks outward instead of inward for how she labels people (which seems to contradict much of what she thinks her logic stands for) and in this confusion (this is my opinion) is mistaking her feelings of dependency as feeling of love, mutual respect and friendship. The last scene of the finale shoves this right in our faces and makes Yukino stand out like a sore thumb.  I'll probably add more once I get home, but I agree with most of your assessments."
OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,Enigmaboob,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:18:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, I support the loner path, I admit my judgment could be clouded subconsiously due to the moments in the recent anime really pushing toward Yukino. So I appolgiise if my judgment could be clouded.   I completely agree on your point with Hachiman. He is cynical. and he was blinded by his views. Which i believe will change toward the end.  Yui wants it all. I agree. So she is selfish in core in this instance, however she does want the other two to be able to express their true feelings. Yes she is emotionally mature, but I do believe the recent strain would have affected her subconsciously to act on her own interest first, because of human nature. No one is selfless.  I never stated the type of love Yukino will have for 8man. I just feel that scenes would be wasted if they aren't used to compare how much she changed in the future. However the time frame used for their looking at each other in the eye is way more than what one would consider socially normal or platonic and is something people that are in love romantically do. Which is why I'm leaning more to that route. However,I may be wrong because the time is not specific in the novels. I also felt they had genuine chemistry prior to all this reliance stuff.   I agree all of this may change, she could fall out of love and prove it wasn't genuine. I hope this is true to be honest. So 8man would be alone. Like how most loners end up.  Yui on the other hand is still a wild card, Yes he loves 8man. But if the reason is just the dog, i think it is too weak.   Also 8 man has rejected her twice. Which means her feelings aren't reciprocated (yet or ever) I also think we need to know why Yui likes 8man. I think that needs to be dwelled in deeper too"
OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,AqueousCactus,3,Mon Jun 29 17:55:29 2015 UTC,"You're right in that the development before definitely skewed toward Yukino - although I think a lot of this can be attributed more toward both her and 8man being so socially inept. I wouldn't put so much stock in him getting flustered by Yukino - he gets just as hot and bothered by Iroha on several occasions as well (this isn't shown very well in the anime, but in the light novels it's very obvious).   I don't really think all the romantic scenes can be considered wasted at this point, either - if it develops her as a character, they matter, regardless of whether or not they lead to a romantic relationship.  I also don't think his previous rejections of Yui have any bearing on the current situation any more. He just now finally put together all the little hints of Yui's obvious (to us, the viewers/readers) love for him, hence the flashbacks to fireworks, cookie-making, etc. I believe in the back of his mind he always knew, but tricked himself into believing she doesn't really like him or her feelings are just out of pity - her speech was basically everything but a direct confession. Willful ignorance is still ignorance.   As for why Yui loves 8man - it clearly started out with the car accident, but I think it's because she's allowed to unashamedly be herself around him (and Yukino). This is a sharp contrast to the Hayama group she also hangs out with. I don't think it's that hard to see why you might fall for someone under those circumstances. Not to mention, love is far from logical, so a bunch of concrete reasons aren't really necessary to justify coming to love someone (I'm disgusted with myself for typing that...)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,AqueousCactus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"I think that Yukino and Yui has more or less a fair chance now. For a few reasons  1 8man realized he was wrong about putting his opinions on them (Ie yui nice) 2Haruno thing about something sinister 3 Yukino not genuine becuase of lack of independence/ reliance  But i still cannot get over how the anime spent so much time establishing eye contact. Although when you are in love you don't think about a reason, there's always some reason. It could be stupid or unreasonable but a reason nevertheless.  I think throughout this season 8man has fallen for Yukino more or less but I think vol 11 will make him think about Yui as well due to his mind's reestablishment of these 2 people."
OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,asianedy,2,Mon Jun 29 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"You can attribute that to the direction of anime more than anything - apparently even WW thought that infirmary scene went on too long on his Twitter (this is just hearsay from other places, so don't take it as gospel). This is also because of the medium as well - the anime can't exactly have 8man narrate every scene as it happens, so we get exaggerated body language and expressions to compensate.  Apparently many more scenes were cut from vol. 11 as well (I guess 8man has a poignant moment with Yui at the penguin exhibit, and he gets noticeably flustered by it), but I believe that is because of them only having two episodes to work with. Yukino will be the driving force to plot from now on, so her interactions are the most important at the moment (even if it means cutting out other important character moments in exchange)."

It's like they sync. 'Even though they don’t usually mesh well, they seem to mesh in a weird sense…)  Also sometimes 8man lies to himself unknowingly when the audience reads it, It does show their predicaments could allow them to understand each other. more so than Yui as she was always with friends and popular (more or less)"
OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,von19,3,Mon Jun 29 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"I love the amount of time/effort you put into this write-up, but I do have to respectfully agree and disagree with a few points you made.   I think the most important in Yukino's development is that everyone wants her to be totally independent. But that's impossible, I think the story needs to find a balance.   I'm actually completely guilty of this. I've been advocating against 8man x Yukino unless she finds her independence. While I agree that there are things that she can't do alone, she seems pretty far from being able to do things alone entirely right now. Even 8man points out how weak she looks compared to how she used to.   On the other hand, Yui is an anime character. Her love fall 8man is unjustified as of yet, other than saving the dog and knowing him afterward.   You're overlooking something you just stated, a point even 8man overlooked just before his 'nice girls' monologue: Yui became interested in 8man because he saved her dog, but she stuck around because of who he is. Does she really need more than just loving the man he is for it to be real? I don't think so. Not trying to argue that Yukino's falling for him isn't realistic, just that Yui's falling is.   Hikki on the other hand, will need to learn to love himself while still being able to help people.   Sensei stated the same. I agree.   I don't think he likes Yui because most of his blushes are from something sexal. Eg. Inhoras whispering and acting cute. or Yui's boobs and drinking from a spoon.   I'm going to have to post a rather long passage from Vol. 8 in response.   Yuigahama took a step forward and placed her hand on my chest, telling me she wouldn’t let me say any more. Right next to me was Yuigahama’s face. Her face that was facing downwards was hard to see. Unable to move away from her, I could only stand there stiffly.  Yuigahama gently raised her head.  “…That’s why I’ll beat Yukinon.”  Her eyes no longer dripped with tears and her gaze gave off a strong feeling of determination.  Just as I was about to open my mouth to say Yuigahama’s name, Yuigahama quickly took a step away from me.  She then glanced around, readjusted her backpack over her shoulders, and talked hurriedly.  “Oh, I’ll be fine here…! See you later!”  “Ah, yeah… See you later.”  I replied with a short acknowledgement to her back that quickly went away. Yuigahama turned around as if she heard it.  “Bye bye, Hikki.”  After she said that, Yuigahama slightly waved her hands.  As I stood there under the setting sun seeing the smiling Yuigahama off at a place where my hands couldn’t reach, the area where she  touched tightened in pain.  When I lightly raised my hand, I pushed my bike and returned to the original street.  After making it on to the big street, I got on my bike.  As I pedaled, I began to think in earnest.  Yuigahama would become the student council president in order to protect the Service Club where she belonged.  Possibly, if someone was going to win against Yukinoshita, then it could be Yuigahama.  Yuigahama had the presence of being in the top caste of the school and she also had other connections which surpassed Yukinoshita. She  held the possibility that could split the favorable votes that Hayama could muster. Even if Hayama’s support made it around, how Miura and the others acted would be hard to predict.  Above all else, Yuigahama was a wonderful girl.   This isn't necessarily proof that he likes Yui, but he does have a vast amount of respect for her that seems to always be growing. Yukino started off high on 8man's pedestal, whereas Yui started pretty damn low, considering how spiteful he is to her in earlier chapters. Yukino has fallen from that pedestal he placed her on, becoming just another beautiful girl completely dependent on him, whereas Yui is also hardly the same person she used to be. Which leads me to my next point.  I'm one of the people who that believe that Yui's intention at the end of Vol. 11/Ep. 13 was for Hikki/Yukino to reject her idea. By rejecting the idea, they're moving themselves forward, away from that which isn't genuine. Yui's understanding of the mechanics of the group is probably deeper than both 8man and Yukino's. She sees that where they're going is exactly where they don't want to go, but she also sees what she fears most: that Yukino loves 8man. As of yet, I don't think she has the strength to leave and let 8man and Yukino pursue a relationship (if it ever comes to be - I support Yui all the way). Thus, she intentionally does something she knows 8man will have to step in and stop.   Another theme that is important is chemistry, chemistry between two people just exist and cannot be quantified. They had chemistry before this over reliance thing happened, So it is highly possible they could work out as a couple. Yui stated this in one of the volumes about them being able to talk or smth.   I'd argue that 8man shares chemistry with Yukino, Iroha, and Yui. Hence the fact that the three largest ships are those three. With that said, I won't deny that Yukino has the edge here right now.   I don't want to sound rude, but this topic doesn't really seem like a character relationship dissection as much as it feels like a ""this is why Yukino and 8man are going to be lovers"" thread."
OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,paladinmahdi,2,Mon Jun 29 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"Actually upon reading you answer I do get more insight and I am not offended in anyway, I do think my judgment has been affected by the anime. Especially the time they used to emphasise continous eye contact.  As i studied psychology although in GCSE.I felt that body language is a very important thing. Yes its an anime not created by psychologists, but there have been movements that strongly hint that their relationship lies deeper than emotional dependance, such as posture,pupil dilation, . In psychology Emotional dependance is far more sinister than what is potentially being shown in the anime. because of that I feel that Yukino feelings stem romantically first and then breaks into dependance. As of now at least.   I do however believe that Yui did know that 8man will reject her idea, But hoped he wont due to her own clouded judgment. As we can see that Yui is in pain she would not be thinking in the right way. Keep in mind all humans are selfish in the end and we do things subconsciously to help ourselves. I believe this because Yui said she is not as nice as we think. So i do think her original intentions weren't so. EDIT: Yes i did overlook the reason why she stayed. I did not think of that went i initially wrote this.  In terms of shipping, I firmly believe in a loneliness path. Highschool is just a fragment of our lives. Nothing significant. Perhaps usually loners end up alone. Sad face I know, but true. However what we do get from highschool is soulmates or friends that you stay in contact with. That is important because it shows no one is truly alone."

That or she didn't have the strength to just give up, one of the two.   In terms of shipping, I firmly believe in a loneliness path.   Not quite where I expected you to fit, but nonetheless, I highly doubt the series will end on the loneliness path. One of the characters will be getting the 8 inches."
OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,paladinmahdi,2,Mon Jun 29 18:23:21 2015 UTC,I hope it would end up in loneliness and 8man gains soulmates/friends that last forever. So hes no longer lonely. I mean how many highschool girlfriends last when they go to college (cuz thats wat happened to me LOL). To me SNAFU is a middle finger to normal harems/romance. So I do think loneliness is possible as usually friends are the most genuine. Couples on the other hand always have something they hide or do just to stay together.
OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,von19,3,Mon Jun 29 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"If the series ended without romance between any of the main three, I feel like everyone would be somewhat hurt. Yui loves 8man, as does Yukino. While they might be able to give up on those feelings, I imagine there would still be a bit of awkward tension. Forever. I almost want to say it wouldn't be genuine, but I don't know where the story will head in those regards.    To me SNAFU is a middle finger to normal harems/romance.    I think Toradora fits that category more, even though I prefer SNAFU."

Naruto and 8man are similar in that they both like girls that have no interest in them, while ignoring the girl that is head-over-heels in love with them. Honestly, we're not even entirely sure if Yuki likes 8man, everyone's theory so far is their relationship has less to do with affection and more with dependance. The same way Sakura always depended on Naruto to fight her battles and bring Sasuke back. Sure, 8man may love Yuki but we don't know if she loves him. Whatever bits of emotion she begins to feel towards him are extremely new and extremely unreliable because she's been under a lot of stress. However, if we go back as far as season one you could tell instantly that Yui loved Hikki to the moon and back. Evidence? Yui followed everything Hikki does down to the slightest detail, when she was getting yelled at in class and Hikki opened his mouth she thanked him for attempting to stick up for her. No one else in class caught that minor detail but her. Now, if we fast-forward to season 2 episode 1 Yuki is STILL embarrassed to be seen with him. Seriously? After everything she still treats him like some type of annoyance. I cant take whatever notion of ""love"" that popped into Yuki's head seriously, when Yui has been silently in love with Hikki since the beginning. So, I absolutely, 100% do not think Yuki deserves 8man, she barely deserves the dirt at the bottom of his shoe."

Honestly, we're not even entirely sure if Yuki likes 8man   I know we are not sure, and her feelings may change, when she becomes better, still the infirmary scene, the staring at Hachiman, making him chocolate, wearing his gift, enjoying being with him, and how she went after him to say merry Christmas in vol 6.5 while Yui didn't,  and how she supported him and encouraged him in volume 10.5 and making him coffee, can be based on romantic feelings more than dependency, and I can argue the one you love you depend on them too.    The same way Sakura always depended on Naruto to fight her battles   Yea that will change in volume 12, the whole novel after vol 6 is about Yukino and how she will change, I don't think Sakura has changed, and she loved Saskue from the beginning, I can't see the similarity here at all.    if we go back as far as season one you could tell instantly that Yui loved Hikki to the moon and back   She liked him at first because he saved her dog, not because of Hachiman himself, as I remember they kept fighting at first and he called her a bitch, then she liked him more after knowing him more.   Yuki is STILL embarrassed to be seen with him.    When is that ?? If you mean at the first two episodes when they were walking at late night, Japan is different than the west, a girl and a guy walking outside at late night is not good, especially with Yukino's family (When her mother saw her late at night).  Also as I remember when Yukino defended Hachiman when Tobe insulted him, and told him to fuck off and get outside of the club.    After everything she still treats him like some type of annoyance.   She doesn't, she's just messing with him and joking especially if you meant her banter. (close friends do that).

I absolutely, 100% do not think Yuki deserves 8man, she barely deserves the dirt at the bottom of his shoe.   Shipping hard eh mate ?  She's the girl who changed hachiman from that loner bullshit and made him become better, she was the catalyst for most stuff that happened, when he confessed to Tabina, Yukino was the most hurt (and he realized this and tried to change), and the whole genuine confession from Hachiman was because Yukino, also I don't say Yui didn't help, she helped Hachiman greatly too.   And I don't understand the hate for her, give her a break, her family is shit, she has no friends, she has nothing, she got betrayed and hurt many times, and you are telling me she doesn't deserve any happiness, Really ?

OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,YukinoYukinoshita,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:32:46 2015 UTC,"Let's consider Yukino's character development for a bit, it'd probably help in figuring out what is going on in her mind right now. Criticism and additions are welcome as I'll probably make several false assumptions along the way.   Up to elementary school. From what we can gather Yukino idolized her sister since early childhood and basically did what Haruno and her parents tell her (well, she was a child after all, no worries so far). Also she got acquianted with Haysma early and developed a crush on him (it is easy to figure out why it would happen). Elementary school. She is bullied by her classmates. It is to be expected, after all: children can't stand those who stand out in any way, that's how it is. Yukino's attitude probably doesn't help too, and she is also too reserved to counteract bullying. Hayama doesn't help, because apparently his social role always was to get along with everyone no matter what happened. Yukino develops hatred towards Hayama because of the whole superficiality that surrounds him. Junior high school. Yukino is always alone and is continuosly bullied. She develops her Ice Queen personality on top of her Codependent personality to deal with bullies. It is a success to a certain degree, but she can't make friends with that kind of attitude and most guys would propbably be too afraid to approach her and ask her out. Thus, left conpletely alone, she doesn't receive crucial emotional development. High school. Yukino meets Hachiman and Yui, who become her first genuine friends. Hachiman is the first guy she takes interest in since Hayama because apparently he hates superficiality as much as she thinks she does. But as with Hayama she's disappointed with her idealized image of Hachiman. She almost gives up on Hachiman, but she shocks her with his geniine speech. After that Hachiman and Yui slowly destroy her Ice Queen facade and find out her real issue — the codependency problem.   As we can clearly see, Yukino could have easily fallen for Hachiman simply because he is the only guy around her now, the only guy she is constantly interacting since elementary school and the only one she developed a close relationship with. Considering that, I don't think we can consider Yukino's feelings towards Hachiman to be genuine as she is not emotionally developed enough to have a romantic relationship for now. Her feelings might turn out to be genuine, but she needs to grow up first, and then we will see."

I mean ot happened to me in highschool. there is alot of people on their year and yukino and 8 man only talk on club while most their time are in seprate class. So we really have to see."

OreGairuSNAFU,3biqga,YukinoYukinoshita,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:00:45 2015 UTC,"I had put some thought into things recently: Yui places the club and Yukino before anything else, because she is trying to set up Yukinon specifically with 8man, whilst pushing back her own feelings.  Yukino seems to now place her friendships before anything, because she knows how special these are to her.  8man puts Yukino before anything, judging from recent events regarding himself protecting Yukino."

Watching the live stream has its perks such as the commercials which are almost always related to the current anime you're watching.  And that advertising:  You'll play as Hachiman once again!  Japan makes a lot of weird commercials but they sure know their stuff when they actually try.

But I can think of several reasons as to why she didn't; consideration for Yui, Haruno's teasing - which happened just yesterday - was not really a confidence booster, her just being herself - she's just not capable of expressing herself when it matters or when it's something somewhat personal or sensitive, there's also bad timing, I think she also decided not to do it at all at some point - not sure if this was when they were in the club or when Haruno came to pick her up. Really, it could be any or all of the above."

Just read through discussion threads or previous ones and if you still don't know then ask away.   I highly doubt we'll ever get another season but at least we have volume 12 and maybe 13.

OreGairuSNAFU,3be0n0,YukinoYukinoshita,2,Sun Jun 28 09:39:23 2015 UTC,"Based on his character, if he knows he would act differently, especially about Yukino, my understanding the only thing he gets that she has dependency and identity issues, not the whole romantic feelings.   I could be wrong though."
OreGairuSNAFU,3be0n0,YukinoYukinoshita,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:46:13 2015 UTC,"True but from the amount of blushing and hesitation from yukino, you don't need to have to be super good at reading between the lines to realize she wants it. When yukino first fails to give him cookies, hachiman's face sorta looked like he knew what she was gonna give him."
OreGairuSNAFU,3be0n0,YukinoYukinoshita,4,Sun Jun 28 09:49:51 2015 UTC,"I think he's in denial, or he can't believe it's possible. though until we read his monologues will know more.   If you mean the cookies in front of the school, only Yui noticed them."

OreGairuSNAFU,3be0n0,ManateeofSteel,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"Yess, thank you. The dog analogy gives me a bit of clear understanding for this season."
OreGairuSNAFU,3be0n0,AnimeFreakXP,4,Sun Jun 28 19:31:39 2015 UTC,"Not oblivious, and increasingly aware that he's been in denial about a lot of things.  He acknowledged several episodes back that his Dark Knight routine is a defense mechanism against having to deal with the pain of being a social reject.  Implicitly, he's aware that Yui's interest in him isn't just about repaying him anymore, and that Yukino doesn't actually see herself as being better than him (which was her excuse for rejecting his overtures in the first season).  He's had to face the fact that his rejection of his own humanity and self-worth was totally unacceptable to the both of them, and that he cared enough about what they think and feel to give up his martyr-without-a-cause tactics.  So does that mean he's fully aware of what they want from him?  Not necessarily.  Often, he's simply choosing not to think about the blatant signs of Yui's feelings, and choosing not to put Yukino's spaghetti-dropping and chaotic emotional vulnerability in the context of himself as a contributing factor - but at the end of the day (literally, at the end of episode's 9 and 13), he knows that they're all avoiding being direct about what they all know is going on around them.  And as of 13, that this must stop, sooner, not later.  Not to talk around the point too much, but the short of it is that he doesn't believe he's really good enough for either of them.  That's a big reason why he's seemingly dragging his feet and not making the big moves.  I think he's reaching the point where he's prepared to accept being rejected rather than pretending not to have a burning desire for ""something genuine,"" even if he can't ever reach it.  Yui thinks the world of him and Yukino; she feels like they've helped her become a better person.  She's prepared to stop dicking around and push the situation forward, to the bitter end if need be.  Yukino has put him on a pedestal above her; she may not think she's good enough for him, at this point, comparing herself to Yui, who is more stable and less burdened with emotional baggage.  When Yui gave her two chances to make a move, she was paralyzed with fear and unable to act on her own desires.  Seeing this catalyzes 8man into stepping up and pretty firmly rejecting the status quo.  He thinks so highly of the two of them that seeing them in such a state - Yui being manipulative, Yukino being weak - forces him to act and deal with what he sees to be the virtually certain fallout of overestimating his own worth in their eyes.  TLDR: He knows (to what extent is debatable), and he knows that he's been using denial as a defense mechanism.  Obliviousness is only an affectation on his part."
OreGairuSNAFU,3be0n0,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Sun Jun 28 21:09:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, you explained everything very well.   It's a defensive mechanism (or a wall you could say to protect himself from getting rejected) so he keeps in denial because he thinks he's not worth it (because he hates himself)  Can't wait to read volume 11 and 12 when it get released....    Yukino's spaghetti-dropping and chaotic emotional vulnerability    This is soo true, I laughed."

OreGairuSNAFU,3be0n0,dukkkzz,4,Sun Jun 28 14:45:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty much implied in the LNs by the way he describes Yukinon that he's in love with her, just that he doesn't quite understand it. At Vol. 9 with the rollercoaster it was pretty much obvious he likes her and can no longer hide it. Something Yui kinda picks up fairly quick in Vol. 10/Episode 11"
OreGairuSNAFU,3be0n0,ManateeofSteel,3,Sun Jun 28 23:23:21 2015 UTC,"What I understood from his issues with orimoto, that he doesn't even consider romantic stuff because of what happened before, but he has feelings and would love to have a romantic relationship, but he is afraid to have the same experience in the past, so he puts a wall around him."

A person like that would easily figure out if a girl is in love with him or at least a bit interested, however, Hachiman forces himself to ignore any advances and hints from any girl because of his lack of self-respect. He thinks he's not worthy to have a girl.  To further prove this point: Volume 10.5 - A date with Iroha.  It was a date, no matter how you look at it, Iroha likes Hachiman. It's clear as a day. But even though they went on a date, Hachiman still forced himself to believe that she was just using him as practice for the day she finally gets a date with Hayama. I guess his traumas are heavier than what one can imagine at first glance but it's true that the reason why he never sees the hints is because he forces himself to ignore them. Similar to Kodaka from Haganai."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdma2,Markaleto,9,Sun Jun 28 05:36:41 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track. Yui let 8man make the decision because she knows that yukino won't reject her plan. She expected and wanted hachiman to deny her plan because she personally doesn't want to do it too. This episode contained so much suffering for yui that I almost switched boats but after rewatching it many times, I can conclude that yukino is still best girl"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdma2,YukinoYukinoshita,5,Sun Jun 28 05:59:38 2015 UTC,"You would have had to change your name.  I also saw Yui's plan as being multi-layered in that she had 8man's interference as a back up plan. She wouldn't want Yukino to just plain forfeit the 8bowl and stay dependent on others. If Yui did that, she would be forcing the guy she loves into an un-genuine situation that he despises."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdma2,haugao,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with seeing it this way are Yui's statements, ""I'm not as nice a girl as you think I am."", ""I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed."". Also, Yui's expression while looking at a teary eyed Yukino in that last scene makes it hard for me to believe she thought it this far."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdma2,iskow,6,Sun Jun 28 07:07:25 2015 UTC,"I saw the ""not as nice of a girl girl"" part as possibly meaning that she wouldn't just forfeit 8man over without a fight. She wants to find out what ""genuine"" thing they are looking for. If she or Yukino just conceded or if both of them just backed off, it wouldn't be genuine because they're pulling an 8man sacrifice for the status quo.  BUT It's honestly really up in the air. Everyone is just making guesses unless the characters blatantly explain their thoughts/intentions. Even so, talking about the different interpretations of this fuzzy final scene is probably the only thing we can do to curb our Oreigaru appetites until the next volume comes out.  Anyways, good night brother. May we find peace in the next volume."

OreGairuSNAFU,3bdeaj,manamono,6,Sun Jun 28 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"Got some of my information from an /a/ post and  Yui's prologue in volume 11 . Transcript of last scene from /u/oregairufan  Due to recent troubles of the clubmates being ungenuine around each other, using facades to maintain the status quo, all of them have noticed this. For Yui, the genuine thing is something she desires as it says in her prologue that:   There’s something [genuine] I want.   Although so, Yui is also deathly afraid of herself being wrong on what is genuine, which would lead to the destruction of everything she loves.   It’s just one, yet my idea of something genuine somehow doesn’t feel realistic. That’s why, it doesn’t matter if I understand it, if I don’t understand it, if I’m dumb, if I’m unfair and cruel, I keep thinking of one idea after the other about what that genuine thing truly is. But it feels like no matter which one I choose, I’d be completely wrong. The thought that I could possibly end up with the wrong answer and be unable to take it back makes me incredibly scared.   She wants to make sure that they are all on the right track again and not putting up facades anymore, but she needs to make sure they all have the same idea of what is genuine. The last scene in the episode was Yui's calculated plan to put the two on the spot to decide to whether to continue the status-quo or to move onto a risky path to something more genuine.  To make sure they all agree, Yui puts them on the spot by first pressuring Yukino by giving 8 the cookies. Then, she proposes a plan for the 3 saying that:   I know the answer to your problem, Yukinon. I think it's probably the answer for all of us.   Her ""solution"" is attractive on the surface; however, if they were to accept it, it would continue the dependacy problem for yukinon, create a deceitful relationship which 8 would not want, Yui would ""win it all"" foreshadowed by the cookies which Yukinon would not want, and to continue the fake status quo. This is actually a plan she created in order to test if they will reject it. She does this to make sure that the genuine thing they want is the same. The risk of losing their superficial friendship ""The thought that I could possibly end up with the wrong answer and be unable to take it back makes me incredibly scared"" does not exist because they could just accept her plan and the status quo would continue to her dismay.  Yukinon almost accepts but luckily 8 steps in and rejects, saying:   And that's nothing but a deception. Vague answers and mutual backscratching, I don't need any of that. I know I'm an idiot (looking at cookies). I know there is no such thing. I know if I try to pursue it I won't gain anything.  But still, by thinking, agonizing, struggling, I....   8 says that what Yui proposed was nothing but ungenuiness and deceit. He says that real thinking, agonizing, and struggling is part of the pursue of genuineness. This is exactly what Yui believed and wanted to make sure if they were thinking the same of. We can tell because she then smiles truly and says:   I thought you'd say that Hikki.   And after that, the group shows a face of genuine happiness implying that the waters are clear for real changes. To throwing away the status quo and risk it all, for the sake of what is genuine."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdeaj,thinair24,2,Sun Jun 28 05:21:34 2015 UTC,This is what I want to believe for now based on what was shown in the anime(will need LN for confirmation). But I might have a preference to not wanting to see Yui as an villain that would take advantage of Yukino's dependency issue.
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdeaj,haugao,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:08:07 2015 UTC,"First of all, this doesn't tell me at all about what Yui has in mind to solve Yukino's problem if 8man hasn't rejected the proposal, which is what I tried to discuss here in this thread. What you said was debated in every single discussion thread already, and you could also see that there's no clear conclusion that Yui was planning to test 8man and Yukino, or that Yui really planned to win. I have a lot of evidence supporting the fact that Yui intended to win and stopped the group to pursue genuine relationship where all of them might not be able to stay together (e.g. ""I want things to stay this way forever"", ""I would be fine even if it's a lie"", etc.). Adding [genuine] to the ""there's something I want"" above is already presumptuous, for example. But then again, that's not the point of this thread.  So let's come back to the topic,    Her ""solution"" is attractive on the surface.    What is her solution that you talked about? That's the only thing I want to discuss. If you truly want to discuss the possibilities of Yui planning for 8man to reject, we can do it on another thread."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdeaj,iskow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:37:05 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about this too. Also, how does Yui have a solution when she doesn't have a clue about the problem(supposedly)? Did Yukino talk to her about it at some point off-screen?   Tbh, I don't think we can have a discussion about this with what info we have at this point."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdeaj,thinair24,2,Sun Jun 28 08:34:16 2015 UTC,"Well I think Yui does have a glimpse of a problem when she saw Yukino copying 8man's words to talk to Haruno and also when she saw Haruno berated Yukino. But then again, how would she intend to solve it if 8man hadn't interrupted is a mystery. And 8man had some kind of unknown confidence that Yui's answer was not wrong until he saw Yukino's reaction too."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdeaj,thinair24,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:08:13 2015 UTC,"We know two things about the solution. It will not solve Yukino's dependence problems and it will create a win for Yui. Since it does not solve her dependence, it means that Yukino would not be standing up for herself or making decisions in the solution. She would not be standing up to Haruno or her mother. Certainly Yui and 8 would not stand up to them since its not their family, etc. Who else is really in the Yukino equation? Hayama. It has to be him because if we were to do something with 8, Yuk and 8 would build relationships and it won't result in a Yui win. I suspect that the group is going to do something with Hayama so that Yukino would not be his betrothed anymore. If that happens, Yukino would be treated like a lost cause by her family and they won't really care how she is anymore. And then, Yui wins the wager and she gets to order the loser what to do. She will order that the club stay together. Then, she will confess to hiki and win. Yukino would not fight it since her self and dependence problems are still there because she never fixed her problems herself."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bdeaj,Phuqs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:30:08 2015 UTC,"We know two things about the solution. It will not solve Yukino's dependence problems and it will create a win for Yui.    I don't get your logic here. If it doesn't solve Yukino's dependence, then Yui won't win the battle and can't order the group to do anything she wants.   Who else is really in the Yukino equation? Hayama.   This statement is entirely wrong. Hayama might be the one she relied on before when she was young, but it's clearly not the case anymore (due to something we don't know that happened between them).    I suspect that the group is going to do something with Hayama so that Yukino would not be his betrothed anymore...   This and statements after this are off-topic. We don't even know if the arranged marriage truly exists or not. And we have seen already that her family was never something she tried to depend on, which was one of the reasons she was seemingly strong and independent in the beginning of the series since she had to stand up to them on her own.  Again, you are not really giving me what solution you think Yui had in mind. If the solution doesn't solve Yukino's dependence in the first place, then Yui has no winner right to do anything."

OreGairuSNAFU,3bcwer,Enigmaboob,5,Sun Jun 28 00:53:20 2015 UTC,"Similar deal to what Hachiman went through honestly. Genuine isnt a tangible idea and this both of them are trying to rationalize the irrational. Hachiman's monologue in genuine speech confirms this when he has a ton of nonsense and sophistry in what he desires; its why his best answer is ""genuine"" but himself doesn't know what that is  The thing with Yuki though is that she is only a few months removed from having her ice wall break; she was always an emotionally insecure girl (unlike Yui who has strong eq and Hachiman, who despite his loner and girl issues, was emotionally secure thanks to Komachi). Combine that with her not knowing what to do or how to act and it gives the impression that something genuine is one of those things who reach your hand out to grab but you can never grab it. But she still latches onto it because its the only thing she has"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bcwer,Fruitsy,3,Sun Jun 28 01:18:41 2015 UTC,rationalize the irrational   threadlurker   Yessir I agree. It's why they all have been struggling: you can't apply logic to solve the illogical. They label this unattainable understanding of the thing that eludes them the most as genuine. That's why I believe Haruno is very intelligent for understanding that they're wrong in thinking that way in the first place. And that's why the ending to this story is going to either enlighten them or crush them once they deal with that fact.
OreGairuSNAFU,3bcwer,Fruitsy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"If only  this series had more Yukino POV inserts like this one....  Anyways other thoughts I have:   That’s why, I actually don’t have a tangible understanding of what it really is. However, every time the words leave my lips, I break into a smile, overcome with the desire to hold my head from embarrassment. If even my definition is prone to errors, then what others thought of it would exacerbate those errors even more.   Love I'm guessing is this mysterious feeling because she probably feels. Not entirely sure. Other thing is identity but holding your head in embarrassment doesnt really fit that bill here  Thing with Yuki's monologue is that what she has with Hachiman and Yui are the only supports she has in her life which is why I think she is desperately clinging onto what is ""genuine"""

Others believe that Yui wanted to force Yukino to confess so that Yui can officially back off and sacrifice her chances of having a romantic relationship with Hachiman. I tend to believe the latter.   I also tend towards the latter. I think it's more of that even if yukino wins, she thinks she can take it and still stay friends with the two of them. but either decision hachiman makes gives yui a boost in the contest that if she wins, her request will be so that everyone stays together regardless of what happened. problem with this is winning the contest for either yukino or yui is kinda bogus at this time since 8man is way ahead of both of them. there's one thing that may confirm it and that is what did she say to hachiman in the penguin scene, if she confessed and got rejected then the former is true. if she didn't then the latter is true."

OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,Enigmaboob,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:06:12 2015 UTC,They will always leave something out. Remember the beginning of the episode about Komachi? I'd imagine there's a chapter for that. I don't think it's as crucial as you're emphasizing it to be but we also go into how 8man thinks about the interaction in which case makes it easier to understand. The anime can't do this all the time as shown in previous episodes.
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,CrazystuffIsee,4,Sat Jun 27 23:36:04 2015 UTC,She means keeping the club stagnant like Hayama's group and not pursuing the genuine thing but also getting the 8 inches at the same time.
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,guyofred,3,Sat Jun 27 19:32:39 2015 UTC,"I think they are all right, up to a point. If you read it line by line, Yui proposes to Yukino that they stay good friends and simply accept Yui and Hachiman as a couple.   Just as Yukino agrees to this, Hachiman steps in and says his piece. He could have short circuited Yui's plan by saying that he isn't interested in her, but he doesn't - this is an important point. Instead, he comes to Yukino's defense by saying that Yukino needs to decide on her own and handle her own problems. She can't let someone else decide her future for her.  Yui then says that she knew all along that Hachiman would say that. This leads me to think that Yui thought this through all the way to the end. That means her real goal was simply to force everyone to tell each other how they feel so that they can resolve the issues. She  was done with the status quo, or as Haruno would put it 'being boring'."

Yui: I screwed up a little though.  Y: Yuigahama-san, you are amazing.  Yui: I said that I'd try it on my own, that I'd say it in my own way. And this is what I came up with. So...it's just to thank you.  H: You already thanked me.  Yui: Still...It's just to thank you. I want everything. Now, and from now on. I'm unfair. I'm a mean person. I've made up my mind.  Y:  So...  Yui: If we each find out how the other feels, I don't think we'll be able to stay the way we are. So this will be the last help we give. The last request I have for us, is about us.  Hey Yukinon, that contest we were having is still on, right?  Y: Yes. The losers have to do whatever the winner says.  Yui: I know the answer to your problem, Yukinon. I think it's probably the answer for all of us. So...if I win I'll take everything.  H(Internal): She didn't say any one specific thing. If she said it out loud, that would set it in stone. She's been avoiding that.  Yui (continues): I know it's unfair. But it's the only way I can think of. I want things to stay this way forever. What do you think?  H (Internal): Yuigahama is most likely not wrong. I have a feeling she's the only one who has seen the right answer all this time. Surely it would be easier just to accept it. But...  Yui (continues): Yukinon, is that ok?  Y: I...  H (Internal): Yes, this is wrong. She's wrong. Yukinoshita can't entrust her future to someone else. There's no way that can be right.  Y: I...I wouldn't mind that...  H: No. I can't go along with that. Yukinoshita should solve her own problem herself.  H (Internal): Yuigahama Yui is a nice girl. I had decided that for myself. Yukinoshita Yukino is a strong girl. That's the idea I had forced unto you.  H (continues): And that's nothing but a deception. Vague answers and mutual backscratching, I don't need any of that.  H (Internal): I know I'm an idiot (looking at cookies). I know there is no such thing. I know if I try to pursue it I won't gain anything.  H (continues): But still, by thinking, agonizing, struggling, I....  Yui: I thought you'd say that Hikki.  Y: Don't decide how to feel for me! And this isn't the last. Hikigaya-kun, we still have your request.  H (Internal): It's ok to be wrong. When we are, we'll just ask again and keep on asking...  Y (continues): And one more thing, would you listen to my request?  Yui: Ok, let's hear it.  FIN  Hell, I thought for sure I knew what all of this meant, now I'm not so sure."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,oregairufan,2,Sun Jun 28 00:35:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can come to a definite conclusion before reading Volume 11 and probably 12 — and even after that. Interpretation is always subjective, there is no ""correct"" one, especially for a subtle series like Oregairu. It'd probably be better if each of us looked for the interpretation that is consistent with what we believe in. Essentially, ""by thinking, agonizing, struggling"" we would come to a genuine conclusion. Maybe in the end we will find out it is wrong, but the conclusion wouldn't be genuine if we just took it from people who write essays, no matter how great they might be, right?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,ganatti,2,Sun Jun 28 08:27:23 2015 UTC,"First time posting in this subreddit... I love this show, still trying to figure out exactly why.  Regarding the question, I've been wondering the same thing. When I watched it the first time, my conclusion was in line with the first explanation where Yui wants Hachiman and the club. Then I read the first few analysis' on r/anime and here and it seemed that people were instinctively drawn to the second explanation. Rewatched the episode and that seemed plausible too.  Note there also seems to be a third explanation where Yui would tell Yukino that they would both back off, I think that's the worst one, personally.  To get it out of the way, I think what Yui intended is not as important as the concept of her choosing for the whole club. Whatever the outcome, it would have been the end - Yukino in particular would have relinquished complete control and play whatever role Yui wanted her to play.  I personally like the first explanation though.  To me, saying ""I will take everything"" and themes like ""Yui is not a nice girl"" seem to fits best when the outcome benefits Yui the most. The alternative explanation implies that ""everything"" does not include Hachiman, and that Yui non-niceness is only exemplified by her wanting to force a non-genuine situation. To me that seems... lamer.  She says she's cowardly and that she plays dirty - creating a situation where Yukino is honor bound not to interfere while she gets Hachiman would be much dirtier than stepping away. Plus, she knows that Yukino is a mess and she's striking now.  Finally when Hachiman interrupts Yukino with his speech, Yui sheds a tear, in my mind, because she was indirectly rejected."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,JDShu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:54:04 2015 UTC,"I'm also on the side of Yui wants to take Hachiman for herself while also staying friends with Yukino. Since that can't realistically happen, either she gives up on Hachiman or takes him, which would likely fatally damage the club.    The quickest and dirtiest method would then be to take Hachiman for herself, and have Yukino passively back down and go with the flow (Yui is intentionally manipulating her for this).     The club couldn't stay the same, but it might at least last a little longer. They could still try to keep up some pretense of friendship for a while."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,doominator10,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:19:36 2015 UTC,"This is how I interpreted the scene as well. This interpretation actually paints Yui more realistically, or more human. She's not a saint, and she's willing to fight for her happiness, despite what it makes her do. I was actually quite impressed with Watari and Yui as a character when I saw the ep and read the scene this way.   Anyways, I don't see this interpretation as wrong, people saying otherwise are as wrong as we are.  Edit: words"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,iskow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:05:54 2015 UTC,"I had a similar thought process to you with regards to the beginning of her speech. The words ""not a nice girl,"" ""take everything"" and ""play dirty"" implied that the end result would be her taking 8man and keeping the status quo of the service club. I'm not entirely sure where other people are getting the ""we both back off"" explanation from.  I read some other interpretations but the cookie scene is still confusing to me. You could interpret her as making the move to show her feelings only(not nice girl) or towards trying to get Yukino to admit her feelings too(nice girl). However, it doesn't make any sense for to her to try to get Yukino to give the cookies if she was planning to ""playing dirty"" in the first place. Does that mean her suggested method was just a bluff?  At the end, Yui says that she knew 8man wouldn't agree with this ""un-genuine"" method of hers. I believe that her plan from the beginning was to remove the option of the status quo and force the group to admit how they really felt.  But then it seems like I'm forcing a Yui is ""nice girl"" mentality again. So I don't even know what to think anymore.  At the end of the day, we're just observers. Even in the LN, we only really see 8man's thoughts. In that sense, we can only make deductions that might not necessarily reflect the character's ""genuine"" intentions. I don't think any interpretations of ours is fully right until Watari makes his decision."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,haugao,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yui strives for harmony, do you think her forcing the group to change would make her feel good. She is afraid of change, and can accept the lie if they didn't turn her down. However, she knew Hikki couldn't. Yui by her nature can't force change, sheis afraid of it, but by proposing the status quo she could get it rejected."

Actually, this is incorrect. When he interrupts her, he is intentionally saving Yui from the pain that she was about to go through had they followed her 'ferris wheel' plan. Heachiman realizes what she was about to set in motion, that she was willing/going to bottle up her true emotions even more, and he responds to it. His interruption isn't an indirect rejection, it's fulfilling what Yui had intended (her response indicates her foresight, ""Of course that's what you would say."") and she is glad that he wasn't going to let the feelings of either Yuki or Yui be repressed further (hence the happy tears from her, i.e. she still has a chance). Yui knew how everything would play out the whole time.  I still need confirmation from the translated volume (despite having read some translated 2ch stuff) but that seems to be the gist of it."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,Enigmaboob,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:16:45 2015 UTC,"I dont think it's any of those.  I think Yuigahama was serious in taking control over everything but for the sake of everyone. She wants their current friendship to last forever. So she wanted to solve Yukino's problem, win the bet, tell Yukino not to confess (as well as herself), and keep things the way they were.  But 8man stops it all and adds another layer to the whole scene. But I discuss that in the episode thread."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,Y-Kun,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:12:13 2015 UTC,"Originally I thought it was some sort of truce where both renounce to the idea of dating Hachiman. Then some guys convinced me it was Yui saying ""back off, Yukinon"". And then, and essay on /r/anime enlightened me on the other side of the coin ""I'll back off, Yuki.)  So right now? I'll just stick with my initial belief until the LN comes out. There is little information on those meager minutes to get the whole picture."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,txchr15,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"To keep it consistent with the way that she backed off of Hikigaya throughout the last few episodes, I think she's going with something along the lines of: ""This is gonna be resolved my way, so that even though one of us won't get what she wants, we can continue to operate as we are, and not fall apart and cease to be friends.""  I think that's the status quo she's protecting. Not their relationship status, because that's probably gonna go one way or another regardless, and I think she acknowledges that. What she's going for is protection of their friendship.   Basically, I can get how one might think that the solution is Hikigaya not going for either Yukino or Yui, but that's not really a solution. Yukino would be unhappy, as would Yui. And if those two are unhappy, then Hikigaya would definitely be unhappy. He knows that taking the easy way out at his own expense makes neither of them happy.  I also get how one could think she's gonna take him for herself, but the way she's been acting is inconsistent with that. She's been backing off purposefully. If anything, I think she's trying to spur Yukino into taking the initiative. She's basically doing the same thing Hikigaya does--sacrificing herself to make Yukino and Hikigaya happy, but if she does it, she knows that she'll be the main one who's really unhappy. I doubt that would make Hikigaya very happy either, but it's better than everyone being deprived of the realization of their feelings. That would just be stagnation--and to use their own preferred language, nothing about that would be ""genuine.""  The point being that there doesn't seem to be a solution where no-one gets hurt, and I think that's why Yui wants to make sure that they can continue as they are in terms of how close they are to one-another, even if one of them is rejected."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,LunarWolfX,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:41:57 2015 UTC,"Her offer in the first place was to take ""everything"" aka Hachiman while still being friends. This would relieve the guilt Yukinon would have had and allow her not to deal with making a decision.  So, I would claim the latter, but not exactly. I believe that Yui wanted to force Yukino to confess so that they can all be open about their feelings. I do not believe that Yui wanted to back off and sacrifice her chances of a romantic relationship."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,DTDynasty,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:01:17 2015 UTC,"This was what I was going for too. The explanation that made the most sense to me was that Yui was trying to force Yukino to admit her feelings. If Yukino gave in to status quo proposal, she knew 8man wouldn't stand for it and step in.  In summary, she ""played dirty"" in that she was forcing their hand to become open to the situation with a bluff. She wasn't playing dirty with the intentions to use the bet to force Yukino to back off."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,haugao,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:34:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, totally agree. Then because of this, Hachiman's illusion of Yui being the ""nice"" girl breaks.

OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,DTDynasty,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think she wanted them to accept her proposal. However her solution was stagnation, they would continue living the happy lie. Yukino would remain dependent on them, and they would all remain friends. Her taking everything is the club going on as it was. The reason why I say she didn't want her proposal accepted that even in her monologue you can tell she wants things to change, to grow, it is in her words, but she can also accept the lie. Yui's problem is that she is afraid of change, afraid of losing those around her, so her proposal was to keep everything the same unless somebody was willing to lead her to the cliff and jump at the same time. It isn't in her nature to propose change, she has always been a force to maintain harmony, but she also knew that she could force change if she proposed that things stay the same. She knew Hikki couldn't accept what she proposed."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbupl,razor150,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:35:49 2015 UTC,"I actually think that both explanations have some truth. I think it needs to be noted that what Yui says is not necessarily what she plans to do. The first explanation would be very contradictory with her actions in the last two episodes, constantly backing off and playing ""match maker"" and even rejecting Hachiman's attempt to walk her home (end of 11). Although she says she wants it all, I really believe that she is willing to give up her feelings for Yukino and Hachiman's relationship because she thinks that she will be able to handle it (she won't). By saying she wants it all, she implies that she is going to make the decision for Yukino, which is where Hachiman steps in, as predicted. So overall, I think that this was Yui's intentions and what she says are different, but the end outcome will still not be what she expects because Hachiman is probably leaning towards ending up with no one"

Something went wrong and they distanced from each other.   So, when Hachiman explained his plan, Hayama hints that Yukino might have been on a similar situation. The plan is something none of them could have done back then, and it seems like it could work despite its unconventionality.  Thus, Hayama theorizes how Yukino might see Hachiman.  I might be a bit off, but I believe this is the gist of it."

OreGairuSNAFU,3bbd3e,LuiMCLXVI,2,Sat Jun 27 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"Nothing, she just knew how both of them would react. Hikki is good at finding patterns in peoples behavior, but often has a blind spot of his own.

OreGairuSNAFU,3bbd3e,gahlo,2,Sat Jun 27 17:07:14 2015 UTC,"I talked about this in the discussion thread.  Here's my take on it: 8man basically saw through what Yuigahama was doing. She was trying to make it so neither her nor Yukinoshita would confess to 8man. Thereby, maintaing their friendship living in blissful ignorance of the their true feelings. Which is exactly that 8man doesn't want. So he goes on to say that speech to basically say, it's okay if we go through all this pain, just as long as it's real and not something fake.  TL:DR: 8man doesn't want some fake and is willing to go through the pain of achieving it."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbd3e,Y-Kun,4,Sat Jun 27 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"They way I see it she had already planned all that to happen, from Yukino not being able to act on her own to Hachiman jumping in to save her once again, not being the nice girl we think she is, she played dirty and tried to force Yukino into acted the way she wanted to, just so Hachiman's instincts of protecting her would trigger, she already knows she has a disadvantage in this race, but she's determined to win no matter what."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbd3e,DaniSenpai,2,Sat Jun 27 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"Don't think that's the case. I'm pretty sure she knew that Hachiman would be the first to disagree because he wants something genuine and Yui told them to accept an illusion.  Besides, he's basically rejecting the idea of saving Yukino and telling her to stand up for herself instead of waiting for someone (most likely him) to come and save her like she's been doing for almost three episodes."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbd3e,LadWatcherIsHere,5,Sat Jun 27 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"I talked more about this in the discussion thread, but wasn't rejecting that idea also saving her? He just declined Yui's proposal to Yukino, not letting her make that choice and not letting her face the consequences of that act, in the end Yukino didn't decide for anything to happen, the people around her did, once again she's shown that Hachiman will be there to save her from any wrong choices or missteps she could make."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbd3e,DaniSenpai,3,Sat Jun 27 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"Oh! When you put it like that, it does seem like saving her. Though I still think he did it because that was against what he believed in, the Yukino he was seeing was not the genuine one and that triggered him to start speaking about genuine things. Yui must have expected Hachiman to be the first one to disagree, I don't think she thought in that way because she thinks he's in love with her or that he prefers Yukino over her. Or that he's her knight in shining armor. She thought in that way because that's the Hachiman she knows.  Another thing I find interesting is how Hachiman has accepted that he placed Yukino on a pedestal with the words Strong woman. Does that mean he now sees her as someone who needs to be saved? I hope we can get our answers with the translation, it sure must have a lot of 8thoughts."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbd3e,LadWatcherIsHere,4,Sat Jun 27 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"What do you mean that wasn't the genuine Yukino? I think that was the realest Yukino we have seen so far, the doubtful indecisive one that can't choose for herself, by saying that he had placed her on a pedestal he had already realized that she isn't the perfect girl he thought she was.   Also, I think it's pretty clear how Hachiman always leans to Yukino over Yui and she probably has noticed already, the fact that she's still willing to fight for it just goes to show how genuine her feelings are."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbd3e,DaniSenpai,2,Sat Jun 27 17:48:11 2015 UTC,"Yukino wants to change. To become independent and make decisions on her own rather than expecting people to do her work as she's been doing so far during the entire season. It's the very thing Haruno always says out loud like when she asked Haruno to tell her Hayato's career path, her answer? Figure it out yourself.  What Yukino was about to do was give up on everything she believed in and what she has been trying to achieve by simply accepting that she needs people to save her and will never do something on her own. Hachiman saw that as wrong, that's not what the Yukino he knows would aim for. Sure, being doubtful and indecisive is part of who Yukino is but that's exactly what she wants to overcome. Letting her fall completely in that I'm a damsel in distress trope would put Yukino back on the road where she began. I get the feeling Hachiman must have seen himself in her right there. She was going back to the beginning like the Ferris Wheel AKA Not genuine.  I know. What I'm saying is that I don't think Yui did it so that Hachiman would save Yukino. She should know by now that Hachiman would disagree with her which is exactly why she basically said If I win, I get to chose our future. She's not exactly giving them options, she's telling them what her plan is and what will happen if she wins. That's not genuine, it's just an illusion. He reacted because it's against what he wants, not because he's Yukino's hero. That's how I think Yui knew how he would react. He knows Hachiman after all."

The only way I could see her problem being solved (and what I thought Yui was talking about when she said she had the answer for Yukino's problems) is that they sit her with her mom and talk everything through, they can be there to support her, but not to talk for her."

Always moving in the same way, through the same road, never going anywhere. That's just an illusion, a petty-self satisfactory and superficial relationship that can make everyone happy.  Hachiman, wanting something genuine, naturally disagrees with that idea. Instead of trying to figure out a word that fits here:  Vague answers and mutual back-scratching... I don't need any of that. But still, by thinking, agonizing, struggling... I... __________!  You should look at the rest of the sentence. The answer should be clear as water."

OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,LadWatcherIsHere,4,Sat Jun 27 19:50:42 2015 UTC,And you expect us to answer that... how?  We're not Watari.
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,YukinoYukinoshita,6,Sat Jun 27 20:16:28 2015 UTC,"That's like asking us who will win the next super bowl, one team can have the better chance but ultimately we can never foretell who will win"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,YukinoYukinoshita,2,Sat Jun 27 20:36:35 2015 UTC,not necessarily looking for hard answers. Just speculation and discussion until next volume
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,Enigmaboob,2,Sat Jun 27 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"Well honesty as much as I hate to say it but I think watari is going to somehow try to create a ""satisfying"" ending where hachiman gets no one because in the last episode Hachiman says that he knows how it will end, and it results in him being alone. I know this isn't something solid to base my thoughts on but knowing wataris writing style, he adds a lot of foreshadowing everywhere. An example would be yukino's obsession with pan san. Ultimately as much as how Oregairu is special and amazing, it's still a rom com in the end. Hachiman was created to be someone that is alone and him being with someone ruins the entire feel and theme of the series. Just my 2 cents  Tl Dr: Hachiman ends up with no one"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,Fruitsy,5,Sat Jun 27 20:50:14 2015 UTC,"As much as it would piss me off, this a strong possibility. There are a lot of things that point towards this ending. Anything can happen."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,YukinoYukinoshita,3,Sat Jun 27 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about No Longer Human? It was heavily referenced in Vol 10 (its a pretty interesting story). But the thing is, Oregariu stresses that things arent always what they seem.    I reached out to the book that was left on the table with my quivering hand and softly touched it. The book had turned cold from being constantly exposed to the wind and I became hesitant in continuing it further and in knowing how it would end."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,ShrewOne,2,Sat Jun 27 21:00:01 2015 UTC,"You mean the ""I know how it would end?"" That was what commie subs said for the last episode."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,RalphZiggy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:09:12 2015 UTC,The line fruitsy is referring to is different. It's from vol10 ch9 at the very end of the volume.
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,razor150,2,Thu Jul 2 01:25:28 2015 UTC,"From a certain perspective this was a story about two loners, Hachiman and Yukino.  By now they already care about each other, spend time talking while revealing more and more about each other,  and do interesting things together.  Then to that we add the interesting relationships he's had with Iroha and Yui and even other classmates.  So I'm not accepting Hachiman's ""will have nothing"" belief, really he already has many things he did not have when the school year started, and there is no way his life is going back to that state."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,paladinmahdi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:02:46 2015 UTC,Hachiman is always pessimistic about things. Because of that he has been wrong and caused misunderstandings. Just because he thinks it is impossible I think it more than likely means he is wrong.
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,YukinoYukinoshita,3,Sun Jun 28 09:59:40 2015 UTC,"The thing is, we still don't know what's Yukino's request, everything will depends on that fucking cliffhanger. and her name is not Yu.   Volume 12 will be about Yukino and her family. That's all we know."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,paladinmahdi,3,Sat Jun 27 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"The ending was supposed to tell the viewer that it doesn't matter what yukino's request is, everyone was opening up to each other and they are going to continue to try and pursue a genuine relationship. I was first absolutely pissed off by the ending but the more I think about it, the more I believe that the ending was perfect. If we DID continue with yukino's request then their issues would just cycle again over and over again. In some ways a vague ending proves to be the best at answering questions. It's hard to look at the ending this way but give it some thought before you down vote me"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,YukinoYukinoshita,3,Sat Jun 27 21:15:52 2015 UTC,"What I saw you from that ending, that there's no source material left to adapt.   It's the same exact ending in volume 11, they didn't change anything."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,paladinmahdi,2,Sat Jun 27 21:17:33 2015 UTC,"Oh and btw in the other book watari is writing, the girl protagonist is called yu and looks similar to yukino :) just saying"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,Fruitsy,3,Sat Jun 27 21:17:36 2015 UTC,"You mean Kuzu to Kinka no Qualidea ?, Yea that's still not translated yet but I read a summary about the released volume 1, seems interesting."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,paladinmahdi,3,Sat Jun 27 21:19:35 2015 UTC,NotYukino has Iroha personalities interestingly enough; though apparently aliens invade so something
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,Fruitsy,2,Sat Jun 27 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"Yea it ends in a cliffhanger or something lol, I hate this word now.   And yea she looks like Yukino but with a a completely different personality (Self centered, and literally bad one)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,YukinoYukinoshita,2,Sat Jun 27 22:21:32 2015 UTC,Bet the MC of that story will start falling for her; its probably a Watari speciality or something.   Not8man has a sister that looks like NotHaruo while NotYukino has a NotKomachi like sister as well
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,paladinmahdi,2,Sat Jun 27 22:45:03 2015 UTC,The way volume 1 ended leads me to believe that the protagonist will actually end up with someone. :) maybe this LN series will give me the ending that Yukino deserves if Oregairu fails to end with best girl
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,YukinoYukinoshita,2,Sat Jun 27 21:21:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know why already you have given up on Yukino, why would Watari do all that to her for no reason ? The story is too much focused on her and her character after volume 6, we will see what will happen in 4 months, I hope I will not be disappointed."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,iskow,3,Sat Jun 27 21:26:41 2015 UTC,"True, but I'm gonna brace myself for the worst so hopefully if the ending isn't as expected then I won't feel as bad. But if it does end well then I will be so happy :)))))"
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbxtt,Madagrey,2,Sat Jun 27 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I thought it was Yukino who decided to give up on 8man for Yui. She seemed to act that way during the date, also, Yui giving Yukino a way out in exchange for winning the bet and taking ""everything""( to stay friends with Yukino while dating 8man imo ) gave me the impression that she was throwing off her nice girl persona to get what she wants. Nothing really is confirmed at this point though, but I still think Yukino is still leading in the waifu wars shit."
OreGairuSNAFU,3bbkcp,OnlyLikesKancolle,3,Sat Jun 27 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"You'll only get to see things from Hachiman's POV so you'll get a helping hand through Hachiman's own explanation of what just happened. However, that won't assure you to get what everyone else is thinking since they're not Hachiman and he can't understand every single thing about every person he meets.  As for that scene, here's an explanation: Remember how Yukino has been trying to give chocolates to Hachiman during the entire episode? When she saw Yui giving those cookies to Hachiman, she assumed that was her valentine present for Hachiman. And those cookies are the ones Yui wanted to give Hachiman since the first episode. Those cookies are the reason why she met the Hachiman and Yukino in the first place."

OreGairuSNAFU,3bab36,hinderdawn,5,Sat Jun 27 07:46:21 2015 UTC,"She doesn't show up at all in the chapters that this episode covered, so that was expected to happen. The anime left out some big scenes of 8man with her just so they can focus on the club drama. If you're going to read the translations for the LN, you're in for two great surprises, unless you hate Iroha, of course."

SNAFU and the light novels have always had a lot of references to other anime, light novels, and manga. I just wish since there will probably not be anymore animation for it they had given it a true ending. I do intend to finish the live novels, but I just like the anime so much they just should have finished it properly instead of ""to be continued in light novel #12"", and it wouldn't really matter if the ending was different.  It isn't as if nobody knows who it will be, it is almost always obvious who girl #1 (Yukino) is despite their preference (Yui here).

OreGairuSNAFU,3babqp,Fruitsy,7,Sat Jun 27 07:57:02 2015 UTC,I don't think he dislikes Yukino or Yui but rather hates the imposed image on them by hachiman. He probably hates Iroha though since he had a kouhai like Iroha before and she was his ex I think?.
OreGairuSNAFU,3babqp,Hippomasta0358,5,Sat Jun 27 10:45:54 2015 UTC,"i don't think so, i think the development was to break hachiman's superficial images of both of the two girls and develop their relationships further. it takes a lot to believably break an ice queen, so that's what he did, break her, a lot. also characters don't have to static, i mean everyone's changed by a lot since the beginning of the series, rewatching season 1, i'm like wow a lot has really changed. edit: though pouring all this on yukino this late into the series is a bit... i guess the word is jarring, would've been done better if they introduced this earlier and more gradually, there was foreshadowing using haruno early in the series and honestly i feel haruno herself is the most jarring character of the series, like she just flipped a switch sometime during volume 9 or 10 when this stuff started to come up. and with all the subplots at the moment it's actually kinda hard to picture we're near the end despite watari saying so, plus we've yet to discuss the fact that the car that hit hachiman was had yukino inside it, but honestly i feel this will all build up to pretty satisfying ending, at least i hope so, if not fxck watari."
OreGairuSNAFU,3babqp,John137,3,Sat Jun 27 08:18:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think he hates Yukino, he most likely hates parts of his teenage self we see in Hachiman, basically tagging people as ""nice"" or ""strong"" or any other way instead of actually trying to figure them out. A lot of suffering Yukino went through is Hachiman's responsibility: first he solved problems by hurting himself without realizing that he hurt her too, and then Hachiman helped Yukino in becoming completely dependent on him being completely oblivious to it too."

OreGairuSNAFU,3babqp,paladinmahdi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:35:01 2015 UTC,"Because that's the plot.  The whole reason why Hachiman joined the Service Club and why Yukino created it in the first place is in order to change. Hachiman also falls in that category of emotional blub.  That's how development works. In this case, that's Watari's style to write development. Remember how Key, the creators of Clannad, Air, Little Busters and all those series, uses traumas, deaths and depression to develop their characters so that they can overcome their problems? It's the same thing with Oregairu. What you see as extreme measures are just Watari's style of developing characters."

OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,LadWatcherIsHere,51,Fri Jun 26 01:15:31 2015 UTC,"This episode did something very well: The development and characterization of Yukino and Yui were masterfully done.  Love normally changes an anime character a lot but in this case, Yukino is still being herself, like if she was showing a side of her that we had yet to meet. A common highschool girl would love to spend time alone with the guy she likes but Yukino prefers to have Yui by her side while being completely oblivious of Yui's own feelings for Hachiman. And when she does find out, she immediately retreats and gives up on giving Hachiman the chocolates. It's just what you'll expect for a girl with no social skills.  And the little details:  I know you're not in good terms right now but... -Hachiman  Sis, I know we're not in good terms right now but... -Yukino  She has reached the point where she even copies his exact words. When she gave 8man her cellphone, she kept an eye on him through the reflect of the window while hiding her own face instead of just being honest with herself and looking at him directly since she's concerned. Yukino has lost her entire confidence and became a dependable person.  And then comes Yui. As always, she reads the mood and tries to make things flow, something usual of her. But this time, she made the choices. Since Yukino is not at her most prominent mood, Yui easily makes thing go the way she wants without Yukino fighting back. She used to be a coward and dependable person who only support people. Keyword: Used. The fact that she was able to bake those cookies and give it to Hachiman is the proof that she's changing for the better too.  Of course, she's not used to it and we can see that by how she's shaking the entire time. She doesn't say anything specific. Everything? That's just her way to say it without directly referring to the thing she's talking about. And her killing blow is the bet. If she wins then everyone would have to accept her answer and never change so they can keep living the same routine. Like the Ferris Wheel. She's not a nice girl indeed.  And this quote:  Yuigahama Yui is a nice girl... that's the way I selfishly labeled her as. Yukinoshita Yukino is a strong woman... that's the pedestal I placed her on.  Of course the person who's less happy about this is Hachiman. That entire idea goes against everything he believed in. Even with all the development he got, that's still something the original Hachiman would disagree with. It's just a happy illusion, not something genuine.  So far it feels like the Service Club reached its top. I don't think they can't improve more than they have or become closer than a friendship allows. Either they change or keep living a superficial friendship. It's like if this kills the friendship end. They won't have that because it wouldn't be genuine.  Watari has created such an amazing build up. I hope he can make a good use of it and give it this series the finale it deserves."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,Black_Frost88,7,Fri Jun 26 03:52:40 2015 UTC,Man i can never write an anime analysis like this
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,DarkWorld97,6,Fri Jun 26 17:10:02 2015 UTC,I would hope that either girl finds happiness with 8man. Or that 8man finds happiness in Iroha.
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,RalphZiggy,6,Fri Jun 26 07:42:59 2015 UTC,Hachiman already is thinking he'll probably end up with nothing even though he could have taken the easy path with Yui as girlfriend and still having club as before with Yukino just silently accepting it all.  But Hachiman derailed that train as wrong;  he wants a 100% independent Yukino and no fake things.
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,DarkWorld97,6,Sat Jun 27 14:23:01 2015 UTC,"He views himself as someone who doesn't deserve happiness. Yukino is someone he fell in love with and vice versa, so it would just be poor writing if he doesn't end up with Yukino."

But he's not going to make any move when she's in no condition to deal with her feelings honestly, and not when she's not being an independent person who stands for themself"
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,DarkWorld97,7,Sat Jun 27 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like volume 12 is going to deal with that primarily. Yui mentioned how they all know how they feel for one another. This ""love triangle"" is going to be going in circles unless someone forces a situation upon our trio for all of them to grow. That person being Haruno and Yukimom. Something has to happen in order to test our characters into moving forward and growing: Yukino growing to become more independent and doing things that she wants. Yui growing to become more selfish, and Hachiman to accept the fact that he can be loved by people outside of his family, be it romantic or platonic."

OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,guyofred,24,Mon Jun 29 14:11:39 2015 UTC,"Yui talked about Hikki to her mom often, apparently. I hope we see more of her in the future. Yukino seemed envious of the relationship between Yui and her mother so she may want to make amends later so they can get along as well. Haruno is damn near omniscient. She knew that Yukino wanted to give Hachiman the cookies and that he was there at Yui's. Also about the genuine thing and Yukino's crush on the 8s but we already knew, or at least inferred that already. Yui also knows that the both of them like him.  The CG sharks and fish looked out of place but whatever. Hachiman actually looking enthusiastic about something was interesting.  I'd say Yui's request is one of the turning point of the series along with the genuine one and sacrificing for Sagami. Just like with the genuine one, the three stripped away another layer from their facade and showed their true feelings.  ""I'm not as nice a person as you think I am."" Hayama said the same this and Yui did, too. Just like how Hachiman arbitrarily decide Hayama was a nice guy he decided Yui was a nice girl. It wasn't that she was necessarily nice, she was just cowardly. Hachiman also decided Yukino was a strong person but what was in front of him was a frail one.  Yukino has a dependency problem that made her weak and it clearly showed here. She almost accepted Yui's solution until Hachiman stopped her. Her final solution was to exterminate the jews keep the club as is and not pursue a genuine one. However that will just make Yukino weaker and Yui more cowardly. Then we get Yukino's request which is... lmao I wonder how they'll wrap it up in a single volume. I hope there's more because my favorite LN series would be over in 6 months :("

Wataru said we were at the beginning of the end in the 10th, but that is nowhere near a confirmation of only 2 additional novels like so many view it as. I agree it will probably be 13. It would make little sense to force the rest of the story into one last novel."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,APassiveVoice,2,Fri Jun 26 04:38:33 2015 UTC,People think 12 will be the last because his contract will end after the 12 (main) novels.

EDIT: IT'S BEEN 15 HOURS YOU ASSHOLES ;_;  EDIT 2: IT'S FINALLY OUT. Commie.. I have no words. worththewait  Wow.  What a finale. That was probably one of my favorite episodes of anime ever. Flawless direction, camerawork and animation. The music kicked in at all the right moments and the animators absolutely nailed the subtle emotions and movements of the characters. For squeezing the second half of an entire LN volume into one episode, that was 10/10. It was so emotionally intense (talk about playing with my heartstrings Feel), and as much of a pussy as I may sound, I teared up at the sight of the Service Club sign and it's last stickers. :(  Small nitpick: I still have a problem with one aspect of Watari's writing: Haruno. Perhaps it is expanded upon in the 11th LN, but she has become a plot device figure that serves nothing else but to push Yukino and antagonize 8man. Kind of disappointed her character lacked some dimensions but whatever. The rest of the episode made up for that and more.   The penguin scene. That was possibly one of the most romantic/heartwrenching scenes in recent memory for me. I have never wanted a character to be happy so badly.   The following scene with the fish as well. Bravo Watari. Way to break the mold of horribly written LNs, you've done well. That was such a meaningful scene with so many layers to it.

OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,RalphZiggy,3,Sat Jun 27 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think of her appearances as impossible, remember she's friends with Shizuka-sensai and I believe Sensai failed to get any kind of rapport going with Yukino so is taking other tactics with her: service club, forcing Hachiman into it, sending certain people/problems to them...and telling Haruno how things with her sister are going.  So while people are ascribing godlike puppeteer abilities to Huruno I'm suspecting Shizuka of being the real Puppet Master Dea."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,oregairufan,3,Sun Jun 28 16:34:59 2015 UTC,"Well, here is something suspicious, at least:in S2E4, when Hayama picks a restaurant at random to take Hikki and their dates to, Haruno is already there! Coincidence? Maybe, but it would explain a lot more if we conclude that she isn't a normal character, but a chorus functionary. (More importantly, it also lets Watari off the hook for writing a character who seemingly has no life or motivations outside of badgering Yukino and Hikki about their little teenage love lives. Making Haruno fill the function of a Greek Chorus is at least a neat literary device, and Watari does it pretty effectively too - you know that she will show up at the exact worse place and time and say the most painful or relevant thing to keep the drama boiling)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,RalphZiggy,2,Sun Jun 28 21:05:15 2015 UTC,"Yes could be suspicious but consider the Hayama and Haruno have no qualms being together or talking with each other because they've known each other all their lives, and Haruno set up Hayama (and Hachiman) for that date.  Not surprising he'd tell her where they were if she asked.  Heck Hayama is probably another ""mole"" for keeping tabs on Yukino and how she's doing."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,TheSilliestG00se,11,Sun Jun 28 23:17:55 2015 UTC,Well this isn't much a a discussion topic from me but… Yui's mom has got it goin' on  She's all i want and i've waited for so long  Iroha can't you see you're just not the girl for me  I know it might be wrong but i'm in love with Yui's mom.
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,Y-Kun,9,Sat Jun 27 06:22:30 2015 UTC,"For me that scene when Yui gave 8man the cookies my heart broke. Like I was on the verge of tears. I felt like in this scene that Yuigahama was sort of giving her feelings for 8man in a physical way. It was so touching.  This episode was beautifully done to show how the trio are still only touching the surface of trying to reach what they wall want. They all want to stay together but all these hidden feelings are lurking waiting to destroy it all.   I'm not sure if my thought process is correct but this is how I saw it: Yuighama told Yukinon that she knows the answer to her problem. In effect, if she goes ahead and solves it, she wins the said contest she was talking about. And then she takes control over everything. What Yuigama would do from that point is tell Yukinon to not confess to 8man. And neither would she (told by the cookies she gave to 8man). She asks Yukinon for the 'okay' to do just that. But Yui knows that Yukinon won't be able to say no. That's why she states ""I'm not as nice as you think I am"".   Of course, Hikki doesn't agree with this (given his past ideals) and tells Yukinon that she should solve her own problems. He sees through all of this and says no because he doesn't want a fake relationship. He doesn't want their friendship to be built upon a mutual secrecy of feelings. He want's the real thing. He wants everyone to be genuine.  Thereby, he's okay with all the pain that will come along with chasing something genuine, ""But still, by thinking, agonizing, and struggling . . . I . . . ,""  Lastly, Yukinon states this indeed is not the last request. She still has 8man's request and makes one of her own. That way, the contest will still go on and there will be no winner yet. Therefore, they can take some time to keep on going as they are and think about how they will handle their feelings. But they aren't putting the issue of 8man aside. They will find the answer they're looking for. All of this being done while staying friends the way they are now.  And all of this will be built upon more in SEASON 3. I mean with an ending like that, there has to be right? If there isn't I will riot so hard.  Anyway, I LOVE THIS SHOW TO DEATH :D I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO TO EXPRESS MY LOVE FOR IT MORE BUT THERE JUST ISNT BESIDES SCREAMING INTO A REDDIT POST D:"

All three of them will struggle, all three of them already feel pain beyond what they can handle, yet they decided to carry on, not stuck in this superficial limbo.   This is going beyond love, in the end, it may be like Hachiman said. He will end up alone, romantically maybe, but he will have gained something much more than that. He will have two souls who care for him, two souls he understands and in turn understand him.   Through all of this they will bend, they will get hurt, but if they last, if they don't break, than what they have gained will be something amazing, something rare, something all of us wish and only few will ever be able to obtain.   And that makes me jealous, so jealous of what they've set out to achieve that I can barely put my thoughts in writing.

OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,thereisnosuch,6,Sat Jun 27 14:13:24 2015 UTC,"Going to have to rewatch with subtitles that aren't horrible, but CR did the trick for now, and it hurt as much as I expected.  I'm actually almost at a loss for words right now.  Yukino is awesome.  8man is awesome.  Yui is amazing, though as everyone who frequents this sub at this point knows, I'm biased.  Obviously we'll have to wait for Vol. 12 at this point, and to be completely honest, I don't know where this series might go at this point shipwise.  I'm looking forward to seeing how Yukino overcomes her 'obstacle,' and now that we've seen strong Yui, I can't wait to see her grow even more as a character. Same with 8man - his narration has been one of the highlights of the series.  It's hard for me to comment on this episode because all it did was leave me wanting more. Was it a fantastic episode? Damn straight. As a finale, however, it brought absolutely no closure, which I, along with everyone else saw coming. It's a great way for the producers to say, ""Read the damn novels,"" and damn it, will I be reading those novels.  With that said, the episode did do a great job at showing us how far they've come. Especially 8man's monologue about how he had automatically associated Yui with nice girls and placed Yukino on a pedestal, when they really shouldn't have been there to begin with. Like I said above, I can only look forward to where his realization of that goes with the characters.   Well, it's been a great run, /r/OreGairuSnafu. Whether you were on the wrong ship or the right ship, it's been a pleasure writing essays with you all.

OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,thejappster,5,Fri Jun 26 12:04:12 2015 UTC,The best moment definitely was when Yukino repeated to Haruno word for word what Hachiman said just a second ago. It was that moment when Hachiman realized what Haruno was talking about at the beginning of Ep 12 (as well as Hayato at the end of Ep 11) and what made him act in the final scene.
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,YukinoYukinoshita,4,Sat Jun 27 08:02:20 2015 UTC,Why did Yukino leave when they were looking at penguins?
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,yourpants,8,Sat Jun 27 05:49:37 2015 UTC,"If you didn't get it, basically yui is forcing Yukino to confess her feelings. She is willing to sacrifice her feelings in order to keep the club going. She gives him cookies to force yukino to give hers as well and she asks if yukino is ok with it in order to force her to say no too. Basically eternal suffering."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,NotCleanDan,2,Sat Jun 27 06:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she's basically saying, ""I dare you NOT to confess because I love him too, and if I'm willing to keep things the same for the sake of the club, then you should as well.""  It's not very nice, but at least she admits to it."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,RalphZiggy,3,Sat Jun 27 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"So when Yui said she wanted everything, did she want hachiman for herself or for the club to be the same?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,NotCleanDan,8,Sat Jun 27 13:35:17 2015 UTC,"She wanted to ""have her cake and to it eat too""; that she would be Hachiman's boyfriend and that the club would just continue with Yukino accepting all of that.  That's the proposal Yukino almost accepted, but Hikki interrupted and said that would be a facade, would be people hiding their true feelings.  Instead he said they should all go for ""the genuine thing"";  that would be where Yukino becomes independent answering to no one's expectations (family plans for her), not dragged down by guilt trips (Yukimom), or following anyone (not chasing after or depending on Haruno or Hachiman).  That would be where Yui makes a real confession even if it breaks the club with the following awkwardness from rejection or acceptance.  That would be where Hachiman knows if he wants romance and confesses himself or accepts a confession."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,RalphZiggy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:06:53 2015 UTC,"But did Yui really expect yukinon to accept that offer? Or did she expect Hachiman to intterupt like he did and help break yukinon from her ""dependancy'' problem (If this makes)"
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,txchr15,3,Sat Jun 27 14:17:27 2015 UTC,"I think she would have taken either choice as acceptable, she's ""not as nice as people think she is"", in her own words."

I interpreted Yui's speech as ""neither of us will make a move"", not ""back off and ill solve your problems"".  I mean, yukino seemed somewhat happy to accept it. A weight off her shoulders, and nothing to worry about. She wouldn't be like that if she knew her best friend was going to date the guy she likes."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,txchr15,3,Sat Jun 27 14:43:41 2015 UTC,"Yui phrase's ""I'll take it all"" to me indicates otherwise; she wants the club, Yukino's friendship and Hachiman as boyfriend.  And Yukino would just be doing what she's done all her life, going with flow and living up to expectations and duty regardless of personal desire.  She'd not have to worry about her feelings of love which are very evident, even Hachiman knew it they are there but too much for her to deal with at present.  So she almost accepted that"
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,oregairufan,2,Sat Jun 27 14:48:49 2015 UTC,"Damn, how did I miss that? Selfish Yui is best Yui!  But isn't it weird for her to say all that (or imply) in front of Hachiman?  Would be awkward for him, and she knew he was going to reject the idea.   Unless that was a very roundabout way to say ""yukino loves you""... Oh, wait."
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,txchr15,3,Sat Jun 27 14:55:48 2015 UTC,"Unless that was a very roundabout way to say ""yukino loves you""... Oh, wait.   Yes, and that makes you both right. Yui point blank tried to get Yukino to agree to stay good friends with her while she is dating Hachiman. Just as Yukino agrees to this, Hachiman stops her. Yui responds by saying that she knew Hachiman would do so. Yui REALLY planned this all out.  This doesn't mean that Yui has given up; as she said, if she wins the contest, she plans to ""take everything"" and that ""she isn't a nice girl"". What Yui has done is to bring all three of them to the point where they've laid all their cards on the table. They can't go back, they can't stay as they are, they can only move forward together somehow, and trust that if they keep trying, they will arrive at what is best for all of them in the long run."

OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,RalphZiggy,3,Sat Jun 27 06:23:44 2015 UTC,"So, right at the start we see the club members and their problems. Yukino lacks the courage to speak her mind and give Hachiman the cookies/chocolate. Yui notices this and is willing to sidestep.   Hachiman of course notices this. Were he the man he was, he probably would've shot her down like he did with Yui, claiming he had to do something and running away.  ""take this sibling fight elsewhere"" my my, Hachiman mans up. It is the first time he stands up to Haruno. It does sound a bit like he just wants to avoid seeing it, but the intention is there. Subtext here is ""you've crossed the line, so i'll back up my friend"".  Yui has a really healthy relationship with her mother. I, as well, am jealous.  I believe most of use called it a long time ago, but now we have a confirmation for our suspicions. Yukino is entirely dependent on Hachiman. She accepted what he blurted as a ""truth"". Repeated what he said word by word. Yui also knows this subconciously. She looked at Hachiman when she was trying to convince Yukino, instead of being her former pushy self. Well, it takes less effort, i guess?  ""Hikigaya must be there with you, right?""Nothing but poison. Subtext is ""since hikigaya is the one making the decisions, i want to talk to him"".   ""you're so nice"" I'm at loss with this one. Is he nice for trying to make things easier? or is he nice for helping Yukino avoid an uncomfortable truth?  Want to address something i hear quite often here. Why is Haruno such a bitch?   well, from the beginning, she was acting like a villain to push Yukino forward. Now that she's stuck, Haruno probably feels impotent and decides to push harder. Not the wisest choice... I mean, seriously guys, you should talk things over.  Triple date! but for god's sake Yui, don't just sidestep! Well, I guess she gave them space so they could talk about Yukino's problems. They're a priority right now. Shipping wars can wait.   Still, Hachiman notices how hard are you trying. Ganbare, Yui chan!  ""And when I win, I take everything"" Talk about confident. Yui's speech is probably one of the best on this series. She know's what's happening. She know how things will develop (probably). Hachiman points out she has been thinking solutions on her own all this time, which might be shocking for people that didn't get all those subtle hints. But she is, in a way, really smart.  ""it might not be fair"" She's bribing Yukino. Want help? fine, but give up on Hachiman. I'll do the same, and no one get's hurt. So sly! But you can't just decide on the group without Hachiman! And he does not agree, as you expected.  There's a lot of things going on here, so I'll wait for the novel before jumping to conclusions.   Finally, someone tells Yukino to stand for herself!!! Hooray!!! it only took eleven novels!  And cliffhanger ending. Thanks for watching, buy the book.  A small thing bothers me here, tough. Hachiman talks as if the entire club wants something genuine, but those two girls were so close to give up on it! do they really want it? aren't you imposing ideals here? The only person confirmed (besides you) to be looking for something genuine is Iroha, mate.   Anyway, feel free to disagree with me.

OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,saintandrewngnnn,3,Wed Jul 1 15:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'll write my essay before reading everyone else's, just so I won't get tired before writing down my own opinion.   So it has come to an end, this episode was excellent, though I wish it didn't end like that, let's get started.   The indecisive Yukino   Once again we're shown this facet of hers that has been discussed in this sub many times now, starting by how she can't give Hachiman the cookies she baked, going through how she basically quoted him when talking to Haruno and the ending scene which I'll talk about more later, Yukino can't think for herself, Haruno said it in this episode and it's true, she has no ""self"", no thoughts of her own, but just a path already drawn by people she follows, she even recognizes this while talking to Hachiman on the aquarium, she knows that's a problem, but can't do anything about it.   The decisive Yui on the other hand  Now we're finally seeing the real Yui, the one that has been lurking in the shadows this whole time, and it caught me off guard, for a moment there it almost felt like she was best-girl, the way she acted, how determined she was (there's a better word for this, I just can't think of it right now), she did all she had to do, she believed in herself and her feelings, and devised a plan that would, once and for all, solve their problems, she acknowledged her feelings and talked about them directly with Yukino, she started what would finally be the path to a genuine relationship.   The oblivious Hachiman   Now, here's something I didn't like about this episode, WHAT THE FUCK HACHIMAN?! He wasn't thinking at all this whole episode?! Was he worried about Komachi? Was he worried about the snow? Did he really not notice anything weird in all that? Is he really blinded by this fake relationship they have? Yeah, he talks at the end, but it isn't even anything significant! He fell right into Yui's plan without even thinking about it! All that was in his mind during the last scene was Yukino and Yukino's problems, really?! This is the first time in your whole life you have seen Yui like this and you're still thinking about Yukino? Let's just go to the next part..  The final scene   So this is it, Yui is being clear about her feelings, how she's determined to win no matter what it takes and how she's going to take it all from Yukino if she doesn't do anything, this is the best Yui we've seen in all this time.   Yukino, on the other hand, doesn't know what to say, this is what she has been waiting for, someone to solve all her problems, right? It has always been like that, she never does anything by herself, so she starts doubting, ""is this really it?"" ""do I just take it?"" all she has to do is make one single decision, to let Yui do as she pleases or not, but that alone is hard.   Hachiman doesn't approve, here's the contradiction to that thread about how no one works for themselves, Hachiman stands up and say that she has to solve her problems, but did he say that so she could grow and make her own decision? Let's think about this question now:   Did Yukino really want Yui to solve her problems, or was she just going with the flow?   We have to remember her conversation with Hachiman, and with all the pressure Yui was putting on her it could've been easy to manipulate her and make her say something she didn't want to, then Hachiman jumps in and says she has to act on her own, but at the same time, isn't he making a decision for her? She was going to answer Yui's request, that would've been a decision of HERS, wasn't Hachiman interrupting her like that, just another way of making her more dependent on him protecting her?   And while we're on Hachiman, was he really interested in saving Yukino from making the wrong choice? Or is he only interested in the fact that she relies on her? By saying that and the following statement about wanting to find a genuine relationship he's just prolonging what's already happening, he doesn't want to face the fact that they're both in love with him and he doesn't want to accept the feelings he has himself, feeling for who? Yukino.   He left Yui while watching the penguins only so he could talk to Yukino, he practically ignored Yui's decisiveness only so he could ""save"" Yukinoshita once again, he was constantly watching at Yukino and their eyes constantly meeting, while Yui lives in a fantasy where they both (she and Yukino) have the same chance to win the bowl, so in the end, this is wrong, because no matter how much she tries, the way things are going, it seems Yukino, as it has been said before in this sub, has already won.   So if I had to give this episode a score:   Music: 10/10 omg the background music when they were looking at the penguins and when they were talking was amazing.   Scenery: 10/10 the drawing was amazing, the details on the fishes and everything was awesome.   Characters: 10/10 redrawing the first request was just awesome.  Iroha: 0/10 no Iroha on this episode  Saika: 0/10 no Saika either  Overall score: 0/10 this episode sucked due to the lack of Iroha and Saika."

So she was planning to confess to 8man but also wanted the trio to stay together even if Yukino ""lost."" Yui is similar to Setsuna in that regard.  There are also the similar personalities of Yui/Setsuna being the outgoing, popular girl and Yukino/Kazusa being mysterious and cold. The image similarities between Oregairu and WA2 might be a bit vague though."

""WHAT DID THIS MEAN, I NEED SOMEONE TO EXPLAIN THIS TO ME NOW"" Luckily, this sub-reddit did that. Well, most of it.  I still don't know for sure wether Yui wanted Hachiman for herself OR she wanted to keep the friend-triangle going for ever. Yukinon never confessed her feelings for Hachiman, but is this because she wants to give him to Yui? And I didn't quite understand what Yui wanted to do with her winning the bet and deciding what Yukinon should do.   edit: Because Yui basically tried to set up Yukinon to confess to Hachiman, but Yukinon never did so. Did Yui ""come out of her nice shell"" and said either you confess now or I take him?  Someone care to explain a bit? I am heavily trying to understand it all, and just as I thought I had understood it, I read another comment that made me unsure again."

That being said, Yui x 8man is not gonna work. My interpretation may be wrong, but I think his genuine speech was his way of telling Yui that he thinks her feelings for him are based in the accident, and that he can't accept them as real.   It'll probably end up as him and Yukinon, but i wouldn't mind a dark horse suddenly appearing, like Shizuka going cougar after he graduates."

OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,RalphZiggy,14,Thu Jul 2 04:16:58 2015 UTC,"Why has Yukino become so, ""incompetent"" now? I mean, she was like, very competent in season 1?   Given what’s happened so far,  I think it is quite realistic turn.   It started at vol.6 Yukino at her best ability, it is also her downfall. She tries her best, and really it is a LOT, to keep Festival event from falling apart, but she just couldn’t shoulder it alone.  And I think it is when she breaks. From the beginning of the series she tries to do all things alone, so she doesn’t depend on anyone (and I think she understands her dependency problem even then), and not to trust anyone (after Hayama and probably Haruno betrayal, whatever it is), so she has only one person to depend to – herself.  However she sees it is just not enough and that she herself is not sufficiently capable for that. Keep in mind also that by that time she is beaten in the competition by Hachiman by a fair amount.  Back to the festival, so seeing she couldn’t do it all alone she breaks,  However then she is offered help, 2 people to depend to (Hachiman and Yui). And just after that Hachiman solves most important problem of the Festival in a single blow(Sagami). So what is she left to? Broken, her certainty in her own power shattered. Mind you, she still tries to do what she can to protect her two friends, as seen in presidents election arc (Iroha request), but again is beaten by Hachiman. And what is more important – what she sees as mutual understanding doesn’t exist, she cannot communicate her feelings and thoughts to them. So she is again (hearth)broken.  Almost to the point she is ready to give up on Hachiman just before his genuine speech. After the speech however she is confused, not knowing what to do, even more vulnerable. However I think that this Yukino, that vulnerable, confused and probably in love girl that we see in later half of volume 9 and 10, that girl I think is in fact closer to being genuine than the Yukino in the beginning. She is more open at least to Hachiman, more exposed.  That's my explanation or understanding of what happened to her"
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,Wolfrecker,2,Fri Jun 26 15:22:41 2015 UTC,I saw the turning point as being at the end of Volume 5 when 8man was going on about he hated himself for imposing his ideals of what Yukino was like and putting her on a pedestal. Volume 6 was when we saw it in action and 8man saw her being somewhat of a hypocrite by taking Sagami's request.
OreGairuSNAFU,3b53g6,buc_nasty_69,6,Fri Jun 26 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yukino is capable when she is given a set goal, but she doesn't really know what she wants and thus it is difficult for her to determine a goal for herself."

Her “nice thing” was so bothersome that you wouldn’t be able to understand unless you experienced it for yourself.

For better or worse, the story can truly be read as a parable of social conformity: either you make relationships or you become miserable. Because, you know, the story could have shown how being a loner can still be fulfilling once one abandons problematic philosophies. (I'm imagining 8man making tea and knitting or going to a farmer's market.) Clearly the story didn't go in that direction.  Kawasaki is probably the closest that we see to an actual loner (Zaimokuza tags along with the group too much), and even then, she has her family. Hayama's story arc becomes hella depressing: make other people's happiness your happiness or never be happy. — Yeah, actually, let's defenestrate Kenneth Burke and just enjoy the series for aesthetic reasons."

It comes out officially at the date you described, but people can still find a way to get a copy in advance and start posting spoilers on 2ch.   I believe Spyro posted the first chapter by translating some pics of the pages that were posted. If you check the leak thread, there's some pics of the pages, which seem clear enough to translate.

OreGairuSNAFU,3aycbe,ganatti,4,Wed Jun 24 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"most will probably take it as just a joke, but even though i think so just as much, just to provide a theory on the other side. what if the reason yui and yukino was so affected was because they had somewhat of an idea that ebina might like hachiman and that was part of the reason they were so upset. ebina was surprised by the confession and may have wanted to say yes, but realized what hachiman was doing and so just decided to play along and reject him. just a thought, probably doesn't hold much water(or wataru ha! ill go away now)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aycbe,John137,3,Wed Jun 24 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"The title of the chapter is ""His and Her Confession Won't Reach Anyone"" so I assumed she was at least half serious. Then again his (Hachiman's) confession was hollow."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aycbe,guyofred,3,Wed Jun 24 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"Some people think that there was a hint of potential feelings, but most feel the it was just in jest. However, I think it is kind of both. Ebina probably doesnt have any romantic feelings for Hachiman, but that isnt what she is talking about when she says ""Maybe it would work with you,"" she is talking about being in a relationship. To me it was more like what she was saying is that her reasoning for not wanting to be in a relationship wouldn't necessarily apply to a relationship with Hachiman. Which sort of makes sense at first glance, but it was more of a ""huh, maybe"" instead of a serious confession, or even close to one."

In the anime we got a flashback to the moment when Yui gave Hachiman cookies in the very first episode of Oregairu and he shook his head.  Interesting. Yui never revealed to him who she was baking those cookies for but we, the readers/audience, learned that it was Hachiman all along. And now he asks himself that question? I think he's finally catching up on Yui's feelings for him. Might explain why he tried to ask her out moments later. We're most likely getting that explained in the next chapter."

OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,NotCleanDan,3,Wed Jun 24 14:04:29 2015 UTC,I think it's even.
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,paladinmahdi,2,Wed Jun 24 14:59:27 2015 UTC,I think Hikki has always known about how Yui felt about him (considering she almost / pseudo asked him out 2 times) but has always met those feelings with apprehension since he's beverage felt anything similar. (also the hating nice girls rant)
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,AeroSkyline,2,Wed Jun 24 09:36:58 2015 UTC,"isn't it something like he always thought those feelings were out of guilt and not really ""real"" since he doesn't value himself enough to acknowledge the possibility of someone liking him romantically?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,celeminus,2,Wed Jun 24 15:55:56 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's definitely part of it. But I was more alluding to the two confessions that happened after he realized that Yui genuinely cared about him.   Just in case"

I think something similar happened during his   But it appears that little voice at the back of his head won't have that anymore. He got a bit excited about the idea of Yui liking him and got jealous when he heard Yukino once gave chocolates to Hayato. He can't ignore it forever, much less right now."
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Wed Jun 24 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, for sure. He's rapidly coming to the point where he can't honestly ignore his feelings for these girls and just shrug it off like he did before. While he may have been able to ignore the not-so-subtle hints and teases before, he's definitely in a much more vulnerable position now (case in point Episode 8, S1 Hikki never would've done that, he would've just shrugged off his desire as something fake that he prepared for)."

OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Wed Jun 24 20:05:31 2015 UTC,I think Yui says to Yukino that these cookies and the first request that she gave Hikki and Yukinon were tied together (that she finally learned to how make something edible)

OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,wardoctr,4,Wed Jun 24 06:47:52 2015 UTC,"I think a non-romantic ending might not happen, after all. I-I guess platonic love works, too!   This made my head hurt, isn't that a contradiction?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,Enigmaboob,2,Wed Jun 24 15:29:38 2015 UTC,That exactly what I thought when I read it.
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,paladinmahdi,2,Wed Jun 24 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"It isn't a contradiction, it was double negative. Spyro probably meant that a romantic ending might happen. Which is why the second line makes sense, that a romance works too. From before, it was possible that Oregairu might end with no romance, as some people would have wanted to."
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,wardoctr,2,Wed Jun 24 18:04:02 2015 UTC,"I get what he's saying, but the issue here is 'platonic' and 'romantic' don't coincide. Platonic love transcends physical desire, whereas romance is heavily rooted in physical interaction between two people desiring one another.  This does bring about an interesting point however: could it be possible that 8man has platonic love for Yukino and romantic love for Yui?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,Enigmaboob,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry about the confusion, when I said romance, I meant the general meaning of being in love, physically or emotionally. IMO, the LN will end with something platonic and nothing sexual. And to your point, I don't think he could do both, and if he ever did, both might not have been genuine from the start. 8man maybe physically attracted to Yui, but you couldn't really call it romantic love. Being aware of how attractive(physically) someone is doesn't really mean you are romantically in love with them. So it'll be a platonic love for either Yukino or Yui."
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,wardoctr,2,Wed Jun 24 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"“I think a non-romantic ending might not happen, after all. I-I guess platonic love works, too!”   Does he mean by all this  that Hachiman at first said a romantic relation with Yukino will never happen, or it's impossible, quoted by him ""“Im not gonna fall for a girl like her”   and Platonic means no romance, just love each others as friends ??? or I'm wrong here.   So that means   non-romantic(Platonic) + might not happen(Romantic = Romantic might happen!  Or I'm just thinking too much about this."
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,paladinmahdi,3,Wed Jun 24 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"When I looked up the word last night, it meant ""intimate and affectionate but not sexual"". What he probably said might have been a double negative, opposite of it is ""that a romantic ending might happen"". And since platonic can be ""of love or friendship"", it can mean both ways unless specified/what is implied. Spyro said platonic love, so it's love.  Some people wanted a non-romantic, platonic friendship ending. I like a romantic ending. But hey, either way works for me, just want to see how Watari sensei conclude it."
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,wardoctr,2,Wed Jun 24 18:14:13 2015 UTC,So he is implying there will be a romantic ending. (While people thought there is a chance for non romantic one). That's what you mean ?   so negative + negative = positive.
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,paladinmahdi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"I think he is implying that there will be a platonic love ending.  There were some people who are wanting a platonic love ending, and some people are wanting a friendship ending, I guess.  It's like this: ""I don't know nothing."", the speaker is saying that he/she knows something. so yeah, neg. + neg. = positive"
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,wardoctr,2,Wed Jun 24 19:02:07 2015 UTC,it more than likely means a relationship without anything sexual happening
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,celeminus,3,Wed Jun 24 15:54:36 2015 UTC,"How even he deduce that,  it means probably Yukino, though after the infirmary scene I'm not sure,  and Yui and Iroha no way they would go platonic.   I think he meant it as a contradiction or I have no idea and thinking too much about something uncertain."
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,paladinmahdi,3,Wed Jun 24 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"its more like a relationship that takes things very slowly and is not based on sexual attraction is my guess? like no kissing and stuff, which I honestly think could work with yui aswell, I think his opinion of her changed a lot even in the LNs (and he is more attracted to the image of yukinon which would kind of support a ""platonic"" relationship with someone else), but really i am grasping at straws here and have no idea what he really means by it"
OreGairuSNAFU,3awyv0,celeminus,0,Wed Jun 24 17:01:44 2015 UTC,"It was ok. Pretty much the same as the anime for the most part. Was kinda annoying to see another Ebina gag, but whatever. We didn't see Yui looking at 8man after the homemade comment. Was probably changed for the anime since we can't hear 8man's thoughts all the time, and at least that would use the whole ""show, don't tell"" thing the anime does well."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,wowthatscooliguess,11,Tue Jun 23 16:01:18 2015 UTC,Aww Yui gets two! Best girl confirmed. Jk   Can't believe this is actually latte. Wonder if anyone drank it afterwards..
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,Lost_Strangereal,7,Tue Jun 23 18:15:43 2015 UTC,"Super impressed with the Komachi one, it looks crazy cute."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,VayneSquishy,6,Tue Jun 23 16:10:22 2015 UTC,>Implying that 8mouto ever has low points.
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,asianedy,3,Tue Jun 23 21:50:56 2015 UTC,"Some absolutely incredible Oregairu latte art done at a restaurant called Belcorno (http://www.belcorno.jp/index.html) located in Ichinomiya, Japan (Aichi Prefecture). So far they’ve made latte art of the three main girls + Komachi, so you don’t all have to fight amongst each other! They do everything from anime to Disney characters. You can also find them on Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,Lonaticus,3,Tue Jun 23 16:01:22 2015 UTC,I'd sell my soul if I still had it for that Iroha Latte. or Komachi
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,RalphZiggy,2,Wed Jun 24 02:14:10 2015 UTC,"No Saki one, so I'm fighting.  The queen of irritable edginess deserves a latte."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,Enigmaboob,3,Wed Jun 24 02:22:52 2015 UTC,That better be Max Coffee.  These are awesome!
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,ploso22,3,Tue Jun 23 17:00:38 2015 UTC,Of course 8man is left out.
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,TonyRimor,2,Tue Jun 23 22:13:53 2015 UTC,Impressive  But None for Hachiman?
OreGairuSNAFU,3aubzu,paladinmahdi,2,Tue Jun 23 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"Whoa I'm amazed,  how is this even possible."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,MrNickJK,11,Wed Jun 24 06:36:33 2015 UTC,"You want to read the LNs, just start with volume 1. They took out a lot of the Yukino and 8man banter also a lot of 8man monologs. The LNs are by far better than the show, the show still being good."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,5,Wed Jun 24 07:11:46 2015 UTC,"Here's an upvote, people hate us these days, and you are right the novels are superior."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,paladinmahdi,2,Wed Jun 24 07:35:38 2015 UTC,"People hate me in this subreddit because I am infamous for shit posting about worst girl. But I was under the impression I was some what liked on /r/anime.  But the show for me dropped in quality after episode 9 or 10 like a lot. It disappointed me a lot, but I still watch it because I love the LN.  Also thank you."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Wed Jun 24 08:24:03 2015 UTC,I thought he got downvoted for talking about the LN while OP is asking about the manga.
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,LadWatcherIsHere,3,Wed Jun 24 07:53:20 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the OP question, that he doesn't know if the anime is being adapted from manga or l.novels.   and what I meant by saying    people hate us these days   The downvotes brigade each time we mention Yukino, especially in r/anime. which is silly."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,paladinmahdi,2,Wed Jun 24 07:56:47 2015 UTC,I get upvoted most of the time I mention Yukino. But I haven't really mentioned her in awhile. Except a post about best girls being mostly kuuderes.
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Wed Jun 24 08:22:47 2015 UTC,"Lately with season 2, I get downvoted (I check yea people upvote but others downvote.) and I don't care about wars and shit."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,paladinmahdi,3,Wed Jun 24 08:25:09 2015 UTC,I stopped caring it is fun sometimes. But it just annoys me now. I am interested in other light novels right now. Yen press ftw.
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:27:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I took that question the literal way because it's very hard to understand.  In Urd's case I can understand it given that he's usually sh*tposting plus he hangs out in r/anime... yeah, not a very good combination."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Wed Jun 24 08:00:47 2015 UTC,"Their is a reason I rarely post in this subreddit anymore. But as I saw this post. I thought I would be somewhat insightful. I didn't even know their was a Oregairu manga, nor do I really care. I don't like mangas to begin with. People usually mistake LN with manga, so I was mistaken as well. I am doing my best to not shit post. But it is to easy to do it."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Wed Jun 24 08:20:58 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. There are three mangas of Oregairu. Although each one is an adaptation of the LN (actually the three mangas came before the anime), each one is focused on something different. One is a 4-koma for pure comedy, the other @comic highlights the comedy part of the LN and the Monologue follows the plot of the LN."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Wed Jun 24 08:47:41 2015 UTC,Now I know
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Wed Jun 24 08:49:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the clarification, I'm a beginner to manga/light novels and I wasn't sure which one the anime was based off of."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,LadWatcherIsHere,4,Wed Jun 24 09:05:50 2015 UTC,"The mangas have not been fully translated. The Monologue manga has only reached season 1, episode 5 of the anime while the 4koma and @comic have only two or three chapters each.  Sorry but reading the manga is not an option."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,socalso,2,Wed Jun 24 07:02:07 2015 UTC,Volume 1 Chapter 1.  I doubt many people are going to recommend any differently.  You're only cheating yourself if you try to jump in at some arbitrary point after the start.
OreGairuSNAFU,3axbj6,paladinmahdi,3,Wed Jun 24 08:48:49 2015 UTC,"You mean the light novels ?? It would be better to start reading from the beginning, also the anime will finish at volume 11. and you have to wait for volume 12, so start reading from the beginning."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axidw,Stepbacks,3,Wed Jun 24 08:08:47 2015 UTC,Anime is at volume 11 right now. It just released in Japan today.  The general prediction is that the LN will not end at 11 and there will be one or two more volumes.
OreGairuSNAFU,3axidw,Lost_Strangereal,3,Wed Jun 24 08:25:26 2015 UTC,"The LN are still ongoing, with volume 11 being the latest installment  the problem is that next two episode (episode 12 and 13) are adapting volume 11. Volume 11 just came out so there's only 1 chapter translated in English. Unless you can read Japanese, you can't read ahead. The translations come out slowly so you're gonna end up watching what happens first before reading it"
OreGairuSNAFU,3axidw,Cult_films,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:26:32 2015 UTC,I can read japanese thank you
OreGairuSNAFU,3axidw,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Wed Jun 24 08:37:27 2015 UTC,Next episode is the finale of Volume 11 and there are no more volumes after that. You'll have to wait for Volume 12 to come out.
OreGairuSNAFU,3axidw,dukkkzz,2,Wed Jun 24 08:49:45 2015 UTC,The anime has pretty much covered everything (besides 10.5 but that is kinda filler). However the anime really ass blasted its way through Volume 7+ so its worth going back to read those; but reading them all wont hurt as everyone is telling you.
OreGairuSNAFU,3axidw,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,3,Wed Jun 24 12:35:32 2015 UTC,"Volume 1, the cut a lot of 8man and Yukino banter also a lot of 8man monolog. The LN is vastly superior in every aspect next to the show. The start from the beginning is worth every minute. I would say this is my favorite LN series, but with it being unfinished and becoming more and more of a harem, it find I difficult to read now and the ending being as obvious as the sun is a star it has gotten a bit boring. But read it for the not so romantic comedy that it is, all the characters are brilliant and totally worth the read, even though the show feels like a harem the LN on the other hand does not."
OreGairuSNAFU,3axidw,socalso,3,Wed Jun 24 08:35:54 2015 UTC,don't tell me to start from chapter 1   Start from volume 1 chapter 1.  Our answer isn't going to change.
OreGairuSNAFU,3awndb,LuBru,4,Wed Jun 24 02:32:12 2015 UTC,"Great to see that you're writing a fanfic. It also has an decent premise, and isn't one of those lame wish fulfillment stories, so nice job. It was pretty interesting and I even chuckled at some scenes. Now let's talk about how to improve it. Of course, this is all my own opinions. If you feel I'm wrong, then you don't have to listen to me.   First, I feel like you should avoid long tangents. I know that's how the LN is written, since Hachiman tends to go on long tangents as well, but it's also difficult to keep the readers attention when they know those tangents don't mean anything. I've often skimmed over Hachiman's Chiba tangents in the LN because I really didn't care to hear so much about it.   The sudden game played on page 8 was a really awkward transition, especially since it tied directly into what Sensei said in the previous part. Who would even suggest that sort of game? Try to find a more natural way for them to arrive at this situation.   Continuing my last point, it still feels unnatural for them to be in that chatroom situation, and then proceed to recreate their first meeting in the service club.   I actually liked the sections where you didn't completely copy the LN. Since this is your own work, you don't have to be limited in what you do. In fact, copying the LN makes me want to skim over those sections more, since it's nothing new for me. You have some decent writing ability, but choose to rely on the safety of using situations from the LN. Of course, if your story absolutely requires you to follow the story of the LN, that's fine. I just feel like fanfics give people the opportunity to do something different, and you really should be focusing on making this your own work.   The very end is pretty awkward when it came to 8man's lines about wanting to be friends. No one puts ""-um-"" when talking in a chat room. The ellipses were ok, but that um really annoyed me.   The library scene felt a little OOC for Yukino. It honestly felt more like I was reading about how Hachiman met Shiori from TWGOK. Yukino is a kuudere, and is also pretty confident. I doubt she would seem so timid during that library scene."
OreGairuSNAFU,3awndb,randomdudeman12,2,Wed Jun 24 03:15:02 2015 UTC,"It was enjoyable.  Didn't realize at first it was an AU.  Pace rando, I don't think you're necessarily going overboard with 8man's rantiness.  He's right about transitions seeming a little awkward.  It works when you're describing the disconnected nature of a chat room environment, but sometimes it seems like there's a line of dialogue missing.  Would read more.  Keep going."
OreGairuSNAFU,3awndb,socalso,2,Wed Jun 24 06:12:00 2015 UTC,"Apart from what others have already said, I think you should expand more on what makes this AU Hachiman different or same as canon Hachiman. Meaning, I think you should post the essay as a prolouge  and expand a bit on the explanation of the situation. Hachiman explaining the chat is nice, but the thing is that all characters are Japanese, while you write western jargon. It wouldn't hurt to at least look up a bit on japanese net jargon. Of course, you can always claim it all to be translation convention, where the change is only made for the benefit of the reader, and in-universe it's just it's supposed to be. Whatever. Apart from that, it's pretty good."
OreGairuSNAFU,3awndb,Taiboss,2,Wed Jun 24 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"Scanned some parts, looks good i say. im gonna give it a go.  also ive noticed that this is pretty long for a first chapter, 9989 words huh.  will give a detailed review after  EDIT: its 2am here so ill make this fast im sleepy.  first off. some parts that felt a bit off.  The library scene - your take on yukino on this felt.. not 'yukino', remember that she is a loner, reserved and tough girl who likes cats/felines. but i doubt she would go as far as staring at a book while someone is reading it.   Wanting to be friends - the placing of this felt unfitting in the mood and wrong, this could have been better if you added some dialouges from 8man before asking snow leo.   oh also you should to avoid stuttering in chat, because no one stutters in chat.  parts that that i noticed were cool  the way that you took parts from thr original LN and transitioning it to this was good, really. though there were SOME parts that was kinda off.  also its kinda cool how 8man has some knowledge about the internet (rules of the internet, there are no girls in the internet etc..) since he doesnt socialize and all. just found that lil bit interesting.  thats all i can say i guess, since its your first chapter i cant give it a rate yet, ill wait for the next chapters or so.   ill be expecting more original plot after this. night"

OreGairuSNAFU,3au5yz,Cult_films,2,Tue Jun 23 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it takes a while. Chapters 15 and 16 are the best imo."
OreGairuSNAFU,3au5yz,Yamigosaya,2,Tue Jun 23 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"Oh theres a new chapter, read everything last night and i say chapter 15 is where my head went 180 edit: finished reading 16, its happening."

OreGairuSNAFU,3au5yz,lightfive,2,Wed Jun 24 00:19:16 2015 UTC,Hachiman ends up dating Yui   Oh I'm so reading it now...
OreGairuSNAFU,3aurdt,johnbon7,3,Tue Jun 23 17:51:12 2015 UTC,"I believe that in Hachiman's case, he is able to notice that Haruno's strategy of pissing people off is actually helping he himself develop as a person, as he is able to realise his faults through another person.   Another reason: plot device yo."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aurdt,CasualRedditer13,3,Tue Jun 23 18:06:09 2015 UTC,"She is not a nice person indeed, as it happens quite often in real life. But I really like her character even in Season 2 where she is more antagonistic than she used to be. Haruno deeply cares about her sister and is afraid now that Yukino and Hachiman won't help each other to break out of their shells. Yukino will likely rely on Hachiman to solve her family issues, while Hachiman will probably be fine with building a new shell instead of coming out of the current one, now with Yukino in it as well.   Is there a reason why we see haruno quite often in places she is unlikely to be in unless she deliberately pulled strings   That bothers me too. I guess she has enough free time to hang out with high schoolers or there's something else we don't know about. For example, Yukimom might be pulling the strings behind the scene and make her do that (and considering what the synopsis of the final episode says, it might be not far off from the truth). I should also note that the age difference between Haruno and other characters is not as high as between Shizuka and her students.   Why do yukino and hachiman , if they are human beings of decent intellect and intelligence as they portray themselves , not even try to push back against her obvious ploys   People are called ""manipulative"" not because they simply attempt to manipulate others, but because they succeed in it. Both Hachiman and Yukino are afraid of Haruno. Hachiman is genuinely afraid of her because he doesn't have much experience dealing with older women (and even girls of his age). He is not sure what to expect from her and she also seems to know very well how to pique his interest and provoke him to do this or that. And yes, she is cute, and considering there is no possibility of romantic development with Haruno, he might enjoy spending time with her — well, in a way. Yukino is afraid of Haruno basically because she is her sister and Yukino can't simply ignore her. Though she is often troubled by her, at the same time Yukino really admires Haruno and somewhere deep inside she wishes for their relationship to get better.   Not much development of her character and motivations.   I'm not sure about that. As you've mentioned, she is much more antagonistic in Season 2. The question is — why is it so? We will probably find out in the near future. Or we already know the answer: she is afraid now more than ever that Yukino won't come out of her shell after all the efforts and will maintain a kind of superficial relationship with Hachiman and Yui, her only friends. I should also note that we don't see her as often as most other characters, and she is still mostly a mystery even at the end of Season 2. I'd say that Iroha is much more developed, and she was introduced much later in the series. We will probably learn much more behind Haruno's motivation to push Yukino and Hachiman towards whatever she pushes them in Vol 11-12, probably even in the final episode of the season (or an OVA/movie)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aurdt,ganatti,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to reply ! ...I really do hope they don't leave us hanging when they end the season , or atleast release an OVA or such .Is there no more information about her in the LN's?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3aurdt,ganatti,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:16:35 2015 UTC,"There is some, like with every other character, but it doesn't help much. I'd say the difference between the original and the adaptation is much more apparent in Saki's and Shizuka's case."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aurdt,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Wed Jun 24 13:56:02 2015 UTC,"Haruno is really the Antagonist of this story because an antagonistic is a person who opposes to the idea/goal of the protagonist(s). In this case, it is Haruno the one pulling the strings and placing Hachiman and Yukino in situations where they have to deal with personal problems and ideals. It applies a lot to Hachiman given that he doesn't want to change but Haruno's schemes force him to do so.    It was thanks to her involvement in the Summer Festival that Hachiman learned the truth about the fact that Yukino lied to him.  It was because of her that Hachiman had to face his past with Orimoto.   Haruno is one of the people who help Hachiman to change against his will so she's an antagonist because she opposes to what Hachiman wants which is just being left alone.  The question in point two and the thing about her motivation is what we really need to learn. Yukino's past and Haruno's motivation are the loose ends so far because, as for the rest of the cast, we know the backgrounds and motivations of everyone else."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aurdt,Lonaticus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:52:28 2015 UTC,"Change is something that a lot of human beings oppose. Especially in hachiman's case as he is quite comfortable in his worldview and in the confidence that no one but himself can hurt him. Forcing him and yukino to change (for the better,i suppose) ,may actually indicate that haruno has well meaning intentions , but since she could have done the same thing in (possibly ) better ways , I don't see why she has to do it the way she does it unless her past and motivations are made clear . Hope the next episode /remaining LN's clear that one ,Or it'll bother me quite a bit :) ."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aurdt,Madagrey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:22:14 2015 UTC,"So, she's a necessary evil. Since it's hard to get anything out of her, except for the occasional minor slip-ups, do you think perhaps a flashback would help determine the motivation behind her actions?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3aurdt,Hippomasta0358,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:38:37 2015 UTC,"Point 1:  Remember that we are seeing this from Hachimans perspective, so it's not like we see Haruno other than the times that our main characters see her. I don't think we can assume that she doesn't have anything else to do because she clearly does (university). The reasoning for her meddling is unclear, but she is mainly just keeping up with her sister and trying to bring her out of her shell (albeit not in a positive way)  Point 2: As some other redditors have mentioned, when someone is manipulative, it's not like you can just tell them to go away because that's what they are good at. Another thing is that Hachiman recognizes the effects of Harunos actions.  Point 3: Although I agree with you on her not being developed, I think it's important to note Harunos motivations. How Haruno found out about the genuine thing, I'm not sure, but it's clear that Haruno is actually trying to help our trio develop because she wants them all to be real with each other instead of trying to prevent hurt among the group. Although Haruno plays the antagonist in a sense, she is like Hachiman in the sense that she uses negative means to achieve a positive outcome. So although she seems like the villain, she is the one who is actually causing the group to move along. That's my take on it but feel free to disagree with me!"
OreGairuSNAFU,3aurdt,TheGuy0ne,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:33:37 2015 UTC,"For point one it may be true that Haruno doesn't really have much friends, the only time she is seen hanging out with others is during their first meeting when hachiman was on a 'date' with yukino. she may be liked or popular but still not have much friends since she is like yukino in a way and also her facade is quite easily noticeable so it would be seen through if she got close to others, hence she may have people to hang  around with but not  genuine friends."

There’s someone I like.”  “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”  “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”  “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”  “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”  “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”  “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”  Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.  “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”  I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.  “That’s why, for now…”  Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.  She added some spice smeared with sugar.  “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”"

OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,LadWatcherIsHere,5,Mon Jun 22 04:02:55 2015 UTC,"Hachiman is a half-done self-insert.   That's been my biggest disappointment lately. Though Oregairu is much smarter than many romcoms, it is definitely more harem-ish now than it used to be. I think that the whole Kawasaki's crush sub-plot is completely unnecessary. It is basically done to please the audience, has no relevance to the main storyline, and I'm glad the adaptation basically abandoned it (as well as some cringeworthy parts of the original like the whole game club thing from Vol 3). The same thing with Iroha, who is supposed to have a thing for Hachiman simply because it is a romcom targeted at adolescent males. If it stayed just as a love triangle I wouldn't mind since both Yukino's and Yui's feelings towards Hachiman are believable (and yes, it is not about just saving a dog in Yui's case).  However I should note that there's a general misconception that this show indulges its audience in creating a sort of harem-ish setup and realizing a fantasy that Hachiman is ""cool"" and ""correct"" and everyone around him is ""shallow"" and ""wrong"". Sure, the show sympathizes with Hachiman and shows that sometimes he has a point but ultimately it represents him as a kind of hypocritical teenager who sees everyone around him as superficial — but he is as superficial, if not more. For a while he has these convenient holes in his logic that are slowly eliminated as the story progresses. The change is less pronounced in the light novels and is more apparent in the anime, with a big shift in tone in Season 2. I personally found the first season to be just above average and became a big fan of the show with the second season. But I find many people complaining that the second season is too drama-heavy, that the comedy is almost gone and the show is not about ""Hachiman being a Batman"" anymore. I guess you see this opinion more or less often because the show allows itself to actually be critical of guys like Hachiman and some of its target audience. It basically says ""before you blame society for your isolation, shouldn't you look at yourself and realize that you don't actually follow the ideals you propose"". For someone who went through the same things that Hachiman did in one way or another it is all amazingly well done, for others it can be a big disappointment — or it may be that they are not ready to acknowledge it yet.  I should also note that the story is not yet finished. Who knows how Watari will end it? Those who dismiss it as mainly another example of waifu wars don't see the point of the show. It is not about who Hachiman ends up with, but what kind of person he becomes at the end of the show. Whether this person will be ready for a romantic relationship is a whole other point. Maybe we will realize that Yukino, for example, is not emotionally developed enough to have a boyfriend and just sees Hachiman as a person who will magically solve her problems, that Iroha just likes to manipulate Hachiman and there's nothing else behind it, and the thing with Kawasaki is his fantasy (remember, the show is told from Hachiman's point of view). That's why I'd be happy to see a ""friendship end"" or an open ending as it would prove the critics of the show wrong, though it may disappoint the fans. I hope Watari will follow his title literally and will attempt to make this romcom ""wrong"" in almost every sense possible."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,ganatti,5,Mon Jun 22 06:45:41 2015 UTC,"Well then, let us begin. I'll start by saying that I have no idea what a YMMV is, but since you just asked for these arguments to be countered, I'll do as I can.    Hachiman is a half-done self-insert.    Throwing yourself in front of a car just to save a dog seems like a good enough reason to talk to someone, I really don't know what to say here, since the way he meets both girls comes naturally, let's start with Yui, he saves her dog by risking his life and jumping in front of a car, at this point Yui doesn't know anything about him or his personality, but she doesn't need to anymore, since the fact that someone is willing to do such things for a stranger is enough to catch her attention and try to talk to him, then her interactions with him in the club show her that he's not really as she pretends to be, but I'll talk more on this later.   Yukino meets him in the service club, does a service club exist in real life? Probably not, but do you also have a teacher punching you around? These kind of stories need to deviate from reality in some points to keep it interesting, since no one would watch an anime about a character writing his opinion on Reddit.   Now, Hachiman himself tries to cover himself up with a lonesome mantle, he's not designed to be a loner, since no one is and I feel that the person who wrote this has never experienced anything similar to what Hachiman has, you don't choose to be that way, if fate decided that the people Hachiman would be surrounded during grade and middle school would not be of his liking, the he had no other choice, I think he talked about it in the LN's.   What was he supposed to do? Switch schools? No, you can see a reflection of himself in Rumi ""I'll meet new people in middle school"", that's what he thought, he maintained hope that he would, one day, meet new people, so he wasn't designed to be a loner, but decided to (see the nice girls monologue) because the world is too cruel and it's easier to avoid suffering by avoiding other people.   I'm not sure if I can write personal experience here, but I'll do it anyway since I love this series for this reason, I myself was kind of a loner just like him, I'd get to school, not talk to anyone that wasn't a teacher asking me a question and rush home, I spent plenty of years that way, heck, I even had my own Orimoto (but I won't mention that), but then what happens? You meet people you can talk to, maybe I didn't just happen to meet two beautiful girls, but Zaimokuza is enough to begin with and yes, even while maintaining that loner image those people you have found will still talk to you and like you, because they have seen past that. Yes, I met girls after that too."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,DaniSenpai,9,Mon Jun 22 13:36:33 2015 UTC,"First point - While the wording is harsh it is somewhat true. In the end Yahari is a LN series so Watari has to pander to its demographic which are adolescents in Japan and judging by other popular LN series they like harems they can self insert into.   Second point - Blatant misuse of Mary Sue aside, it seems they missed the point of her character. To paraphrase what she said ""I acted like I could do anything. Like I understood everything"" and she acted consistent with this quote. Just like every other character in the series she's flawed. Hachiman's view of a perfect Yukino was shattered fairly early on and it should have for the viewers as well. Haruno wants Yukino to crawl away from her dependency of people. One of Yukino's role in the story is to be Hachiman's catalyst to change. If it weren't for her he wouldn't have progressed as far as he would have now. Hachiman's defense mechanism to not get hurt is to close himself up and discourage people from talking to him thus not have anyone (especially girls) close to him. He opened up his true feelings to her and Yui. Yukino is also rather underdeveloped and there's still a lot of enigmas surrounding her.   Third point - They missed the entire point of the series. The point is that Hachiman's lifestyle is toxic and his methods don't save anyone. You're not supposed to feel sorry for him. He self sacrifices because there's little damage and it's supposed to be selfish. The only example of his harem growing due to self sacrifice I can think of is Rumi and even then... eh. Anyone glorifying him is idiotic. The whole 8atman shit really irritates me for that reason."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,guyofred,5,Mon Jun 22 05:06:28 2015 UTC,"You're not supposed to feel sorry for him.   Oh? Please explain.   He self sacrifices because there's little damage and it's supposed to be selfish.   Little damage in the outcome? Selfish? Is it selfish because he wants to do it his way, the way he knows will work and have, as you put it, little damage (at least to him). He's an idealistic go-getter and it's just who is to work alone until absolutely has to have other people involved/has people close enough to rely upon."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,Lynac,6,Mon Jun 22 05:45:03 2015 UTC,"You're not supposed to feel sorry for him.   I mean, why should we? What he does is despicable, selfish, and doesn't solve the problem at hand. Nothing praiseworthy here.   He self sacrifices because there's little damage and it's supposed to be selfish.   He disregards other people's feelings and in the end doesn't even solve the problems. He hurts people and only sweeps the problem under the rug at best but ignores all that just for self satisfaction in knowing that he solved the problem. He only confronts and (somewhat) atones for it in volume 9"
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,guyofred,3,Mon Jun 22 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"You're not supposed to feel sorry for him; maybe his friends, but not so much him. You could feel sorry for him, but not because he is some tragic hero, instead, because he has been shaped by his experiences to deal with life's obstacles in his twisted way. He continues to refuse to accept that he has friends that he cares for and employs self-sacrificing methods which may not be an issue for him, but they disregard any of his friends' feelings. In this way, he is being selfish."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,InfestedSugar,6,Mon Jun 22 09:30:04 2015 UTC,"I think the selfishness is not intended and is therefore not really there as much as it seems to be made out. He doesn't mean to be selfish at all. He wants an ideal situation where only he has to be the one to get his hands dirty. On paper it's great, but in execution is where his struggles are revealed.  I think he disregards their circumstantial feelings in order to have them inevitably happier (or so he thinks). He is far from all that bad, truly. I mean, S2 is a turning point."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,Lynac,2,Mon Jun 22 09:59:42 2015 UTC,"Selfishness, intended or not, is still selfishness. I don't think it is right to devalue it.  It seems my comment may have come across very negatively, as though I dislike Hachiman. That wasn't intended, but nevertheless it came across that way so all I can do is accept it and try to change my phrasing henceforth - much like Hachiman's selfishness. I do not dislike Hachiman. It may have seemed that way, but if you point out the negatives in anyone, it would seem the same.  The whole point of this was to argue against the misconception of Hachiman being some god, or even more so, against the misconception of him being like Batman - that idea, which may be linked towards certain aspects of his character, has been taken too far by the fanbase."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,InfestedSugar,3,Mon Jun 22 17:05:38 2015 UTC,"I agree the fanbase's opinions have become very polarized. He's no god, just some troubled teen. Nonetheless, I'm pretty forgiving in general and get both your argument and my own."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,Lynac,3,Mon Jun 22 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"Hachiman is a half-done self-insert. He’s designed to be a loner and loser who, despite his flaws, finds himself surrounded by girls who, one way or another, end up wanting to hump his d-ck for very simple reasons that almost feel like an excuse or just plain weak writing. He saved Yui's dog, he told Saki that he loved her and Yukino... Yeah... He’s pessimistic and very self-centered which gives charm to his character but, in real-life, a person like this would never be liked by anyone but his family.   You can agree with it, but that doesn't necessarily make the story worse. In fact, I believe that we're supposed to self-insert into Hachiman just so that we actually learn something from the story. It continuously frames things in a way which shows how wrong he truly is. It's like Watari is trying to tell the Otakus to grow up and live a normal life.   And why make the comparison to real life? Good stories don't have to have a realistic premise. I think everyone knows and has accepted that the premise of this series is ridiculous. But what the story does with those characters after establishing that premise is pretty well done.    Yukino is a mary sue. Her purpose in the story is almost non-existent. She’s… just there. She accepts requests, tries to do something and eventually proves to be… useless. There are moments where her actions contradict everything that her character represents. One of her most famous quotes is “We don't feed a starving man a fish. We teach him how to fish and make him independent.” Then she starts doing everyone’s jobs after three requests. Best example is definitely the school festival where she does Sagami's entire job instead of teaching her how to do it herself. Made worse later on by how her development is basically fall in love with Hachiman and become dependable of him. A mary sue in its purest form.   tfw I can't actually answer this without spoilers. Shockingly enough, there is a point to this. Also, the definition of a Mary Sue is wrong (I believe) here since she isn't perfect, as she is never the one to actually solve the problems. I also feel like there is some exaggeration here, since ""doing everyone's jobs"" only happened for the school festival IIRC.    The story makes Hachiman a god. All requests are perfectly designed to ensure that Hachiman saves the day through a speech about loneliness and its perks. And at the same time, it makes him look like a broken hero who has to sacrifice himself for everyone’s sake while we feel sorry for him. I’m sorry. That’s hard to do considering his deeds only result in him getting more girls to his harem so he actually wins more than what he loses and since Hachiman hardly cares about his social life, the damage is very tiny. Plus what he does is very selfish so he's basically asking to get beated up so where is the part where I have to feel sorry for him?   If you believe that the story is trying to frame him as a god, then try to look a bit deeper. The general consensus is that Hachiman is horribly wrong. He sounds convincing, but being convincing doesn't mean you're right. He solves the surface problem, but the problem could easily happen again since he never solves the root of it. Just look at Rumi's problem in the camping arc. Also, believing that Hachiman doesn't care about his social life is also untrue, since there are a few scenes which shows how deeply he can be hurt. The ending of the festival arc really shows this.     I tried. I'll write some more stuff later, since it's past midnight where I am. Probably didn't even write good counter-arguments in my sleep-deprived state.    A lot of these sound like people watched the first 3 or 4 episodes and then wrote the series off as another generic harem. I think really understanding the nice girls speech would've probably helped whoever made these comments, since taking it at face value the first time can mess up your view of the series.      All right, I'm awake now, so let's keep going. I can think of a ton of opinions about this series, so I'll try to talk about ones that haven't been mentioned here yet.    Totsuka is a hilarious character.    No. Maybe the first few times you see him, but the fact that he was only inserted into the story in an attempt to sell more LNs is pretty bad. But I'm glad Watari accepted this and gave him next to no character development for most of the series. At most, he shows up for a few seconds, does the ""8man falls for the trap"" joke, and then leaves.    8man is a gary-stu.    So this is one troll thing that was popping up on threads before the second season started. I can't imagine someone actually believes this, but I'll write something just in case. Being a Gary-Stu implies you're pretty much perfect. Hachiman is not perfect. He has a twisted view of the world that shows he doesn't really understand how the world works. He has no friends. He rejects girls who are into him. He isn't actually that smart (he sucks at math despite being such a ""logical"" person).    This series is melodramatic bullshit.    Now here's something I have a slight problem with. If I look up the meaning of melodrama, it means to exaggerate situations in order to get a reaction out of the viewer. But this series never really exaggerates things, or shoves problems in your face. Most of it is undertones, which wouldn't really fall under melodrama. In fact, I believe that since people are reading too much into said undertones, they feel like they are being smacked in the face with ""melodrama"". Unfortunately, melodrama is a buzzword that has negative implications for series, which is why I see people use it so easily, since it means they don't actually have to think when they say it. People should realize that not all melodrama is bad.   Now then, if they were to say the drama is unrealistic, then that's fine. I accept it isn't realistic. Do I care though? Most drama is unrealistic, but that's what makes it so much more interesting. We get these situations that produce fantastic scenes and amazing character development. I like the series because it has good characters, and those characters only grow and change through these 'unrealistic' scenes. It's important to realize that this is not a plot-driven show. I've already seen a reviewer who I assumed to be smart make that mistake, and blamed the series for a lack of plot.   What I can accept instead of that quoted statement would be ""I didn't like the drama"", which is completely fine since tastes are subjective. But using buzzwords to shit on something makes it harder to take the opinion seriously.    Haruno is a complete bitch. Why does she even exist? She's such a unrealistic antagonist.   Haruno is probably one of the better characters in the series. But she also requires the viewer to think more about what she says along with her actions. One of the most important moments for understanding her character is in the festival arc, when Haruno talks about being the villain in order to force people to change. Her methods are questionable, but she does actually love her sister very much. You really need to spend time thinking about her and her actions before bashing her. I admit that some of the latest episodes might have her being a little too strong, which may lead some people into using this quote even more. I still believe that she is doing everything for a reason though, even if her methods are a little crazy.    This series uses generic tropes all the time. I don't see why everyone is praising it when it does stuff like that.    In the beginning, this was a series that had little potential to sell well. So what did Watari do? He wrote in generic LN things that would help in the sales of this novel. Once it became popular enough, he started to write the main story that he wanted to tell.   Also, I doubt anyone really boasted about how this series subverts tropes. All it does it try to be aware of most of them, and use them in a pretty standard way. Again, what people love about this series is how good the characters are. We can forgive the use of generic LN tropes, since it doesn't happen too often in this series.     As an aside, I want to say that not understanding the series is not a valid reason to criticize it for things it actually does well. I've seen people think poorly of the series because things didn't make sense to them. At most, that would be a problem with the adaptation, since I've almost never seen people have that problem when reading the LN. Even if they were confused about something, there's a huge community of people willing to answer questions. Heck, a simple search through threads would allow them to find their answer.   I consider it to be unfair to series when you criticize them without putting the effort in to understand. This is probably one of the few series that forces you to not take things at face value. Honestly, it doesn't really take that much effort to think about what's happening and understand why. It's just the viewer being lazy, and in that case, this series would not be for them.     Another aside, but I feel like this is an anime that requires at least 5 episodes from the viewer instead of the standard 3. The nice girls speech really is one of the biggest moments in the series, and it's what captivates most of the viewers when they watch this series for the first time. If they really understand it, then they're probably going to keep watching, and even if they took it at face value, there will be some continued interest in the series."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,randomdudeman12,5,Mon Jun 22 05:04:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of these sound like people watched the first 3 or 4 episodes and then wrote the series off as another generic harem.   You're not wrong. This particular opinion is from a Top 10 Best Animes of 2013 and Oregairu appeared as a special mention for trying to be different but ultimately failed. The fact that the speaker said And at the end, both girls fell in love with him is proof enough that he didn't watch the anime to the very end. Unfortunately, his opinion is shared by a lot of people who also dislike Oregairu for being a generic harem anime (at least in their eyes).  Really wish to get more from you."

OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,Lonaticus,2,Mon Jun 22 13:32:01 2015 UTC,"Wow. Those were some glorious points, specially the one about Saika which can extend to other side characters. Zaimokuza, Saika and Saki were the monster of the week or in this case the client of the week but apart from that, they're hardly relevant to the story. They become pure plot devices and comedy relief.  Season 2:   Zaimokuza helped Hachiman with the blog. Saki made the list of candidates for the blog. Saika bought Hachiman time to reach Hayato at the marathon.   And that's pretty much all that matters about them. Those are the only relevant things about them during season 2. If there is one thing this series has a hard time dealing with is purpose for the characters. One can argue that these are just humans and they're not supposed to be turning points for every little argument. But I've read works where the writers managed to do this just fine proving that Oregairu isn't doing their best at this department."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,Lonaticus,3,Wed Jun 24 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, so lemme defend our little devil lord, but first.. Zaimokuza.  Zaimokuza is a self insert character by the author whose major purpose is to mock or otherwise present the state of the Light Novel, Anime and sometimes Pop-Culture Industry in Japan. He does so in a humorous fashion, with exaggerated movements, shouting and the occasional chuuni one-liners.   He receives a bit of development, but most of it is indirect and only in relation to the main character. I'll come back to this later.  When Zaimokuza and Hachiman interact, it serves to strengthen the view of the author as they can be considered two sides of the same coin, that coin being the LN industry. Zaimokuza's character is in contrast with the more cynical approach of Hachiman. Zaimokuza's more optimistic view serves to lighten up the mood and not make the reader think the critique is in any way relevant to the main plot.  Some people think that Zaimokuza represents the author's more optimistic and naive side, when he initially approached writing and tired to get his works published. On the other hand Hachiman is the the more cynical part of his personality that has already entered the medium and experienced all of its aspects.   The interaction between the two characters in Spoilers 10.5 This volume also describes another of the author's issues in latter chapters, mainly about Spoilers for 10.5 Chap 3 and 4.  Zaimokuza's second purpose in the story is to show how other people of Hachiman's age cope with loneliness and the feeling of being marginalized by society. They are both introverted by nature and they both show different ways of escapism. Hachiman builds a wall of cynicism as his defense, while Zaimokuza embraces his childish side and escapes in the inner world of his imagination.  All things considered, I'd say Zaimokua is a great character, whose purpose in the series is often misunderstood. It can serve as another self-insertion for some readers, albeit to a far lesser degree. People who find him irritating, while displaying similar conduct should see it as a warning signal, to their own issues.  Edit: Sorry for poor structure/grammar. Will edit it sometime later today."

What makes these points really funny is that Zaimokuza is based on Watari's only friend back at school while Hachiman is based on Watari himself. The two are literally self-inserts. You can't call Watari uncreative for using anime cliches because he really wrote what he knew from real life."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,DaniSenpai,2,Mon Jun 22 07:02:08 2015 UTC,"Did not know that! Also would explain why I thought Iroha is the same, a projection of a person he knew/knows in real life."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,iskow,3,Mon Jun 22 07:11:27 2015 UTC,"Now then for Iroha, /u/danisenpai need your help for this one bro! Please, counter me, because I get the feeling I will be lynched hard for what I am about to say in the conclusion.  First Part: Introducing the character  Iroha's first introduction in the series doesn't let the reader think that she is more than an episodic character, at most a plot device, who will initiate powerful events that change current static environment in the clubroom. And boy, she does that well. Be it his care for all the characters, or the fact that she might be the projection of someone the author met in life, Iroha receives quite a lot of development in future arcs and for a while becomes the main focus of the story.  Her childish and playful nature when first introduced is a trait one would expect from a 15-year old high-school girl. In many ways I think she is meant to be a character that the younger audience can relate to, young, immature and fearful. Yes, I say fearful as she is afraid to move on her own, without assistance, until a certain event helps her change. The mask she wears is her childish desire to be popular, to be recognized by others. It doesn’t play a large role in her story later on, even though she hasn’t completely removed it yet. I’d say it will become important one more time in the conclusion of her story.  Second Part: Christmas arc  Her development is closely tied to Hachiman's in the beginning, and is often influenced by his later on. This initially happens in a negative manner as she is manipulated and pushed into a role of leadership and the responsibility that comes with it. This is unsuitable for someone immature and with no previous experience. Both her and Tamanawa as seen in the Christmas event arc are unsuited for their roles and try to cope by emulating what they think more experienced people in their place ought to do. The sudden responsibility scares them.  This fear pushes Iroha to try and seek assistance from a person she views as more mature, Hachiman. One would argue as to why she did not choose Hayato. This was a person she idolized, yet knew nothing about. Feelings of anxiety may have been too much for her. On the other hand she at least knew Hachiman and his unorthodox, yet effective methods. She wasn’t as afraid of him and his brother-like behavior thought the arc helped her warm up to him.  Third Part: Destinyland and her growth  Seeing Hachiman’s fragile state when he confessed his desire to seek something genuine shook her to the core. Here is a person she teased, yet thought of as a mature/capable Senpai, crying and opening himself in front of two other people. For someone who tried so hard to hide behind a mask and was too afraid to step forward by herself this came as a shock.  Some people might argue that she wasn’t invited to witness that scene. So what? As we readers are allowed to witness it, so should characters. After all the purpose of that confession was to help both us, and the characters, realize something about our inner selves, and in the process change.  For the first time in her life she takes initiative, she confesses to Hayato and gets rejected. Why? Because he is a character that mastered the art of wearing a mask and saw right through her. He realized she’s only infatuated with him, and yet unaware of the lingering feelings of love she has for another, Hachiman. (Easy there don’t lynch me, we’ll get to the love bit later and you’ll see that it’s more complicated than that.) For the first time in her life she feels the pain of rejection. Again, Hachiman plays an important role in her life as the figure who tries to console her and support her though this painful moment. This is the point where she starts becoming aware of her true feelings and murmurs a small request: “please take responsibility, okay?”  If Hachiman’s clubroom request is the trigger, the confession and train scene are the moments when she begins to change. After that we see her road into becoming a more independent and strong person, a true leader, no longer afraid to take the initiative. But Stuco Prez isn’t the only place where she displays this newfound aggressiveness.   Fourth Part: Hayato/Valentines arc and beyond  She earnestly started vying for Hachiman’s affection while still wearing a mask, the mask of someone who is in love with Hayato. This is her biggest lie, one which will play a crucial role later. The great chemistry they share helps her with this, as he starts becoming more and more conscious of her.   My question for you now is, do you think what she has right now is romantic love for Hachiman?  Well, the answer is no, at least not yet. He played an important role in her life as a guiding figure, more like an older brother or a father.  The turning point for her will be when she realizes that the affection she has for Hachiman right now resembles more the love for an older sibling or father. This can either happen naturally through time or forced through an important event (her birthday is coming up in April; Vol 12 or 13 maybe). This is where I see her arc ending, or where she will finally reach the climax of her growth in the series.   Last part is my hope and speculation, as I really think she has a winning shot at winning the 8bowl as long as she keeps going at it this way. Though the way she might win this is if the main trio reach a friendship ending and she meets 8man later, perhaps in college, when they could fall in love as equals.  Conclusion  In conclusion, yea I think she is an amazing character, and my own favorite in this series. Her antics with Hachiman are always entertaining to watch. Her growth is more natural, it happens as a consequence of hers and others actions and it’s not forced. What people can take from her character is that you don't need to be the hero of a story, but can still learn and grow by following others and taking good advice from their actions. She represents well how a child can grow into her own when influenced positively by the proper seniors/adults.   Note: I'll try and re-structure it later. I'm not a native speaker. As a note, can anyone help me define a contrast between her and Hachiman? I was thinking about her name ""Isshiki"" and how 8man mentioned that he's self-concious ""Jiishiki"" in the Christmas event arc. Of course, we know that has changed a bit since then.  Also... have mercy"
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,paladinmahdi,3,Mon Jun 22 08:43:23 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'm honored to be mentioned, didn't think anyone noticed me.  Second, what do I need to counter?    In conclusion, yea I think she is an amazing character, and my own favorite in this series. Her antics with Hachiman are always entertaining to watch. Her growth is more natural, it happens as a consequence of hers and others actions and it’s not forced. What people can take from her character is that you don't need to be the hero of a story, but can still learn and grow by following others and taking good advice from their actions. She represents well how a child can grow into her own when influenced positively by the proper seniors/adults.   I don't see anything bad there, maybe it's because I just woke up, but I completely agree with that, she's my favorite character also and her growth thorough the story is completely natural and relatable/understandable.   Is she based on a certain person that Watari met in his high school life? Probably, the way she is initially described is not something weird or impossible, it's, as you said, a young girl trying to adapt and move her way into high school, her active personality helped talk freely with other people and expand her relationships where otherwise she would only be talking with others from her grade.  Now, about the growth itself, here I kinda disagree with you, since I believe it started in the Christmas event, when she (despise the rest of the council's opinion) made the decision to present a double act for the event, there she started to act on her own, why? Because of Hachiman, what she heard later just pushed her further, but not in the same way, it didn't push her to make decisions about the council, but about herself, maybe I'm not expressing this very well, but I see it as two different kinds of motivation, one that allows you to make your homework or participate in a club or competition and the other that allows people to see your true self and Hachiman pushed her on both ways.   Now, why Hachiman? And is that romantic love? Let's start with why, since we're talking about the anime we'll assume that they meet when she asks the club to impede her being chosen as president, here then Hachiman starts to work on his plan to avoid breaking the club, but Iroha doesn't know this, what does she see then? A senpai reaching out to her, presenting a solution or a different point of view to her current situation, so instead of trying to change it, he proposes her to embrace it, and again, here I agree with you, she starts to see him as an older brother or at least someone she can rely on.   But just because he helped her she doesn't start to see him as an older brother, you have to add to that the fact that he doesn't wear a mask, he might have lied, but his personality and his feelings were already on the table, as a person who doesn't have experience with people it's easy to deal with him, she doesn't have to wear a mask because he just doesn't care about it and she slowly starts to realize that.   Is it romantic love? Here is something that might come as a language barrier, what is a romantic love exactly? Getting married? Because if that's the case then no, but does she only sees him as an older brother? Now? Probably yes, her actions and lack of jealousness lead me to believe that she hasn't considered the possibility of losing him, or maybe she already noticed and started making her move, let's not forget how open she was about giving Hachiman chocolate con Valentine's, but that's too recent and nothing much has happened since, so I won't go too deep into that."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,oregairufan,3,Mon Jun 22 13:14:02 2015 UTC,"ugh, can't really write long essays right now cause I just found out about FF7 but I can't help but comment on this. I'm really curious, are these people who hate oregairu avid anime viewers? I'd go apeshit if someone talked shit about oregairu and then posts a comment like ""Onodera is best girl!"" in the next thread...  I'll just post my thoughts on Isshiki Iroha then. She's a latecomer, and sometimes, we just can't help but feel that she's just an add-on or a plot device. Though she does serve this purpose at times, she is also, actually, a character quite similar to the SC members. Think about what brought her to the SC room in the first place, where 30 people conspired to make fun of her, to bully her. Though she acts foxy and cute, she isn't actually popular. She also has a sort of rotten personality. The service club notice this but they don't criticize, or at least, not harshly. Why would they? When they're all pretty messed up themselves. To Iroha, the Service Club room is a haven. She fits in. There's also Yukino who IMO she admires ( considering what Yukino's done for her for the xmas event, and how she acts cute with Yukino I think this is the case ). Yui who she's friendly with. And 8man who she might be sub-consciously crushing on. As for the service club members, we know 8man thinks of her as something like a lil sister, Yui probably thinks she's okay but maybe a bit annoying, and as for Yukino, well imo, she's exasperated but fond of her anyway. Iroha is Yukino's first kouhai acquaintance, though imo I think she already thinks of her as a friend ( she serves her tea and let's her invade her personal space ).   It's also possible that she's aware that there's something going on with the SC members. That her flirting may be to make the other girls jealous enough to actually make a move. I see more Komachi ( a wingman ) in her than a potential love rival. I think she's a neat addition to the group."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aobkr,oregairufan,3,Mon Jun 22 08:01:08 2015 UTC,"When something becomes popular, it will attract attention to it, and more haters. so it's normal.  I found two kind of haters for this show ( who doesn't understand anything about it, and the other kind who loved season 1 (comedy and witty) stuff and didn't like the change to a more serious tone in season 2 or the aspect of harem-ish you could say, which is very low compared to other shows.   I'm not an expert on writing about characters and my English is not even my first language but I will try.    Hachiman    The entire point of story is about how Hachiman is that he started off as an edgy loner who was constantly saying how much he hated everything about people pretending to be someone else, that being alone better than hurting yourself when you open yourself to others, but since S2 you can see that his dumb mindset changed because of what he did in ep2. Of course he won't outright admit it, it's ""embarrassing"", but the characters like Hayama are constantly mentioning it or Sensei.   In season 2, they started to show us, why his method don't work, they only fix the surface, especially that's why Yukino was butthurt in ep 2, etc.    finds himself surrounded by girls who, one way or another, end up wanting to hump his d-ck for very simple reasons that almost feel like an excuse or just plain weak writing.   I don't know about them, but Hachiman is a nice guy, who cares about his family, and friends, and cares about Yui and Yukino, he is a good looking guy in the novel too, his confession made them realize that he cares about them and he wants to be closer with them. I don't know the aspect of a loser coming from, being a loner doesn't make you a loser, this is just our bullshit society made us think.   And for Yui and Yukino to have feelings for him, it was very believable, and we still don't know for sure that Yukino really has romantic feeling for hachiman or just dependency.   they sit and go out with 1 guy for more than 6 months, they got close, this is how human relationship works.    Yukino is a mary sue.    Yukino was shown as perfect as the beginning, but as we saw, she's not. and Hachiman realized that and her perfect image got shattered in his mind;    Her purpose in the story is almost non-existent.   She is the drive force for Hachiman, she is the reason he stayed in the club, because he admired her at first and wanted to be her friend.   and how she was butthurt when he confessed to Ebina, lead Hachiman to change himself and to make his genuine confession, because he doesn't want to lose his friends and he cares about them (especially her).   We still don't know what happened to her in the past, she still need more development, but we caught a glimpse of her shitty family, and we understood a little why she's like this, and I think the focus at the end will be about her."

OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,nathanoi,2,Mon Jun 22 20:24:16 2015 UTC,As sad as it is. Im wondering why Yukino is in the same bus as Hachiman and Yui isn't.  I mean Yukino is in a different class so normally wouldn't she be in a different bus from the one Hachiman is in.
OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,TonyRimor,5,Tue Jun 23 17:09:53 2015 UTC,well uh one of my friends i introduced to oregairu always greets me yahallo so i cringe so hard that i fly into the sun

OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,paladinmahdi,7,Tue Jun 23 17:06:31 2015 UTC,It's god awful fan base made me dislike the series more.
OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,guyofred,4,Mon Jun 22 04:19:14 2015 UTC,"The people here are lovely, we are not that awful, outside of here it's another case entirely."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,Lonaticus,5,Mon Jun 22 07:50:30 2015 UTC,90% of the content here is just waifu wars and what was on /a/ yesterday. LN threads on /a/ were probably the best but it got utterly trashed since the anime started airing again.
OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,paladinmahdi,3,Mon Jun 22 14:44:07 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, discussions here are separated in different threads and you can be more picky, without having to navigate through the sea of shitposts like on /a/. Sorry about spamming so much waifu war material, but as long as people enjoy it, and it's done without strong insults, I see no harm done.   I agree, the LN threads on /a/ were great, and they'll probably be back after a month or two, once most of the anons move on to trash another anime. We can and do have quality discussions here sometimes as well, like the recent YMMV thread."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,InfestedSugar,3,Tue Jun 23 04:51:08 2015 UTC,"At least here like Lonaticus said, it get separated, some posts are waifu wars, other are serious posts.   Today it was my first time heading to /a/ and seriously it was disgusting, now I completely understand what you meant."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,DaniSenpai,2,Tue Jun 23 12:36:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe not now, but from the look of more recent posts/comments, we do seem to be heading towards that direction."

OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,DaniSenpai,2,Mon Jun 22 13:47:40 2015 UTC,"We are certainly better than /a/ but from the looks of certain posts and mostly comments, I get a feeling that we may be headed towards more shitposting in the future - not like there's any helping that considering that is what most of the online community sees in the show, nor do I have the right to derogate what others seem to enjoy (why else is it so frequent)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,InfestedSugar,3,Mon Jun 22 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"Now then, what is shitposting? The ship wars? The troll posts? Yukino?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,DaniSenpai,2,Mon Jun 22 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"I am not completely sure of the definition of shitposting, as I have only learnt of its meaning through context, but I would assume what you listed is part of it (although, the Yukino part I don't quite understand).  I think /u/guyofred 's reply to /u/paladinmahdi is accurate, though."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ao66o,Lonaticus,4,Mon Jun 22 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"I guess if you're looking for a completely serious discussion about the series then that could be bothersome, but, as you said, some people do enjoy it and it's not as bad as /a/, since I feel this community has the right balance where you can find some good arguments when you feel like actually arguing, while those other posts are just a nice way to pass time, though I might be saying that because I do like my fare share of ship wars from time to time.   Also the Yukino thing was just a ship joke, don't pay it much attention."

OreGairuSNAFU,3ak3tb,Inori92,4,Sun Jun 21 01:13:53 2015 UTC,"Could also be a different ending, just for the anime's sake so they can give some kind of conclusion to non LN readers"

Though it's kind of confusing why they'd adapt a volume that hasn't hit the shelves yet - I mean, won't that affect sales? and isn't the anime spoiling the LNs now? - it does sort of give us hope that we may get another anime adaptation - an OVA or a movie - of the show (since something anime original would make bridging the gaps really awkward imo)."

When we read the chapters we all will rage why they didn't do this and that. In short they presented a great story but the LN will add onto it making it more of an outstanding story. I think it's expected they can't fit it all and some of the viewers know that to support the author you have to buy their merchandise.

OreGairuSNAFU,3ahqys,pEuAsTsSy,7,Sat Jun 20 08:01:17 2015 UTC,"Authenticity, a word that we can safely substitute for ""something genuine,"" has become a buzzword among millennials (almost an aesthetic, we could say if we're feeling really cynical). Listen to an advertisement that's selling something to young people, and you'll hear that ""authenticity"" is being sold in the same way that sex sold Coca-Cola. Most people don't seem to realize this or don't seem bothered by it, but I understand your doubt about ""genuine things.""  In the OreGairu discussion threads, you'll see many readers/watchers discussing ideals with regard to the trio's ""something genuine"" quest. This, I suspect, may be the result of Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works airing in the same season. There's probably some credence to the discussion of ideals nonetheless. While an ideal cannot be realized, it can be pursued. Implicitly, however, the ideal will be rejected at some point , which is disheartening to accept. A further line of discussion would be whether ideals must be abandoned as false or if they can be believed in in spite of their impossibility—a line of discussion that I'll choose to sidestep.  When it comes to wanting ""genuine things,"" I think that we first want to turn inward. How much do we understand ourselves? Can the self be articulated and communicated? Do I completely understand my motivations? If my habits change, am I still the same person or am I someone else? It follows that, if authenticity does not exist (that is, if the self is not knowable or understood), then true intimacy cannot exist either.   Ludwig Wittgenstein, an Austrian logician, makes an interesting claim in his later work about understanding someone. I'm not so versed in Wittgenstein to give a perfect representation of his view, but essentially, though we can't ever have a genuine understanding of ourselves or of other people, we can still sort of ""get"" them. For instance, I may not ever be able to completely understand my S.O. if I had one. There will always be things that I don't know about him, no matter how much he tells me. Nonetheless, after spending enough time with him, without him saying anything or even behaving in a certain way, almost unconsciously I ""get"" how he's feeling. I can tell if he's tense or relaxed, if he's had a good day, if he'd benefit from some tea, &c. A person's inner state, Wittgenstein writes, is apparent—sometimes clearly, other times subtly.  So I guess my response to #3 is that I paraphrased an Austrian logician instead of providing any original thought. Myth = confirmed, you're welcome.  This is becoming kind of lengthy, so I'll give up rather than connect this to the OreGairu cast. I will add that Yui is the best at reading the ambiance, for what it's worth. Also, to reach this level of unspoken intimacy, people must spend a significant amount of time together. This time spent together has been under constant threat for both the Service Club and Hayama's group. Preserving the status quo means continuing to be inauthentic, and changing the status quo means altering the group dynamic and risking the time spent together necessary for intimacy. This, I would argue, has been the major conundrum in the series."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahqys,sonanddeath,2,Sat Jun 20 12:29:12 2015 UTC,"Most people don't seem to realize this or don't seem bothered by it, but I understand your doubt about ""genuine things.""   I concur. Sometimes I wonder if life would be easier if I was dumber, I'd probably never worry or even think about such things and just go on with my life.   though we can't ever have a genuine understanding of ourselves or of other people, we can still sort of ""get"" them.   I have reached the level where I can ""get"" what kind of person someone is after a very short time of observing the said person. However, that still doesn't mean I understand the reason why that person acts the way it does. But I believe I'd overcome that obstacle after spending a significant amount of time observing/being with that person.   So I guess my response to #3 is that I paraphrased an Austrian logician instead of providing any original thought. Myth = confirmed, you're welcome.   Haha, don't mention it.   Also, to reach this level of unspoken intimacy, people must spend a significant amount of time together.   It's basically the same thing I mentioned above. Are either of us genuine? (Clearly I'm just joking here)   Preserving the status quo means continuing to be inauthentic, and changing the status quo means altering the group dynamic and risking the time spent together necessary for intimacy.   I still think that Hachiman is the most ""genuine"" out of those three, he doesn't try to meet anyone's expectations (Yui does try to match people around herself, while Yukino tries, well tried, actually, to please her mother and be like her sister). However, she no longer tries to please her mother and no longer runs after her sister, so I believe that doing what she feels is best is a step in the right direction for her. Despite what Haruno says, I do think Yukino is being genuine in all but one thing - her feelings for Hachiman. Same goes for Yui.  Oh well, this also got a bit lengthy but I hope you dont mind."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahqys,sonanddeath,3,Sat Jun 20 13:02:36 2015 UTC,"I have reached the level where I can ""get"" what kind of person someone is after a very short time of observing the said person.   The problem with an empirical/observational approach is that one can only understand how someone behaves within a certain context. Our identity is contingent upon context (e.g., whether I'm supposed to function as a student, a son, a teacher, &c.). So to say that someone understands me if they only observe me in the classroom is not incorrect, because they may, in fact, have a very good understanding of how I act in and interact with that context, but it would be wrong to extrapolate that conclusion for all contexts. However, by spending enough time around me in different contexts, one will get a pretty good impression of who I am.  On a side note: There's an internet-popular quote that goes something like ""you are who you are when nobody's looking"" (when nobody's looking = without context). I think that 8man provides a good and important challenge to this. By being a loner, he didn't become authentic: he just became bitter.   I still think that Hachiman is the most ""genuine"" out of those three...   I'll admit that I don't tend to concentrate my attention on the main trio and their dynamics I have a far nobler agenda, but I think that you're right to say that 8man is the most invested in the genuine thing. While all three underwent a trial to an extent, 8man is the one who endured the longest trial and ultimately reached the epiphany. He told the other two and they agreed that ""something genuine"" should be pursued, but they lacked the same urgency that 8man had for his resolve. — This is arguable, of course, because the lesson is relevant to all of them, but I'm not the one to argue it."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahqys,AeroSkyline,3,Sat Jun 20 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think Hikki's goal of something genuine is something that you can get close to but never really 'get.' Honestly though, even though this may be an impossible goal, I think just pursuing that which is genuine is commendable enough to where the Service Club can take pride in the result."

OreGairuSNAFU,3ahpda,AzzleTrazzle,8,Sat Jun 20 07:35:24 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, Haruno is pointing out that 8man's current situation with Yui and Yukino is not geniune i.e. the romantic tension between the three. It's similar to Hayama's group with the previous Tobe-Ebina situation, instead now with the trio. Neither of them want to admit any of their romantic feelings because they know it might ruin their group relations so they hide behind facades. Haruno messes with them in order to get 8man to see the hard truth."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahpda,netvorivy,3,Sat Jun 20 09:26:21 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, I think Haruno is the one who is ultimately right here. Earlier in the episode, 8man talked about enjoying the present the most because fuck the past and the future. I guess that's the story's way of telling he's not ready to commit to anything yet although the answer seems obvious. Honestly, the show makes it seem that 8man and Yukinoshta are holding back to keep Yui around. Though it's prolly more along the lines of Yukinoshta having deeper family issues than what's already presented and 8man wanting to keep the Harem going on a bit longer."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahpda,razor150,5,Sat Jun 20 09:55:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't get that feeling at all, because Yui is pulling away. Hachiman asked her if she wanted to go out, and asked if he could walk her home. Twice she turned him down, something she would have never done in the past. The person who is holding back is Yui, Hachiman and Yukino don't really seem aware of much of anything. I really doubt Yukino even knows Yui's feelings."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahpda,saibayadon,2,Sun Jun 21 05:28:23 2015 UTC,"Oh you're right. She said it's not gonna be fair. She seems more aware of what the other two are going through and probably doesn't want anyone to be a third wheel, whether it be her or Yuki."

OreGairuSNAFU,3ahpda,chitoge4ever,2,Tue Jun 23 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know about toradora, but the idea of them talking about it off-screen would be the most common thing that would happen irl -- not so much in this. Kuuderes don't operate the same way as irl people do! No matter how much Yui pester Yukino with her ""ne, ne yukinon-chan~"" asking what she thinks about 8man, yuki would just shrug it off with her usual response: ""He's creepy"" or ""talking about him would be a huge middle finger to society."""
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahpda,CrazystuffIsee,5,Wed Jun 24 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"This is all discussed in the official discussion thread but it's basically that their relationship isn't actually genuine, their group status right now it's the same as Hayama's group, what's genuine about that? They're lying to themselves, they're lying to others and keep acting as if nothing happens, ignoring all their problems just for the sake of enjoying their youth.   Why's that a problem? Do you remember how the anime starts? With a monologue about how Hachiman despises teenagers who live their high school life trying to get the most out of it, trying to enjoy ""the spring of their lives"" and now he's one of them, he's going against the ideals he once held on to, remember the inner conflict he had before, the collision between what he thought was true and what actually is, Haruno brought it up to light because now she has to put Hachiman in place and remind him that this life he's living is not real."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahpda,redaka0,3,Sat Jun 20 15:13:09 2015 UTC,"Well, this guy put it pretty perfectly.  I just wanna add something about genuine that when 8man had the talk with yui n yuki, iroha was outside listening everything. Which is why she got motivated and in the spur of high spirits she confessed to hayama and gets rejected (which is why she blames 8man 4 her untimely confession). And that's where hayama found out about the genuine thing and well you know how haruno and hayama are. That's probably how haruno found out about the genuine thing.  BTW how she knew about genuine is not mentiond in LNs as well. She just found out."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahpda,DaniSenpai,2,Sat Jun 20 17:23:34 2015 UTC,I thought the genuine talks came from Iroha talking to Haruno. In the LN that's how Haruno found out about the rumors and went to talk to her 1 on 1. The anime never did this but I could imagine they just played off the fact that she's perceptive enough to see what isn't genuine. If I were to think in Hayama's POV I don't see how you could narrow down the genuine source talk from the service club.

OreGairuSNAFU,3afoo7,KitKatxz,3,Fri Jun 19 19:37:13 2015 UTC,and also don't forget the fact that totsuka was chuckling as well but she was hiding it while telling Hachiman to not laugh.
OreGairuSNAFU,3afoo7,Hippomasta0358,4,Sat Jun 20 07:36:07 2015 UTC,but she he was hiding it while telling Hachiman to not laugh.    He's a boy.  Sadly.
OreGairuSNAFU,3afoo7,DaniSenpai,2,Sat Jun 20 15:16:56 2015 UTC,I think 8man was laughing because there is a guy who actually agrees with Yui's stupid idea.
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahu7x,looo180,19,Sat Jun 20 08:57:52 2015 UTC,"Well, 8 in Japanese is hachi, so there."
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahu7x,albert_2mb,4,Sat Jun 20 09:08:40 2015 UTC,And why does his name include the number 8 in it? He was born on the 8th day of the month.
OreGairuSNAFU,3ahu7x,DaniSenpai,4,Sat Jun 20 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"-man is also 10,000 in Japanease, so a rough translation of his name would be 80,000."

OreGairuSNAFU,3afq9c,Bomjus1,5,Fri Jun 19 19:39:12 2015 UTC,"Q1: Mixture of both. He's distancing himself from the club and blaming himself for her presidency by helping with the Christmas project. It has nothing to do with protecting Yukino, it's more about protecting himself.  Q2: The show is currently adapting the unpublished Volume 11 (which is released next week in Japan)  Q3: There's no real general consensus because Watari's narrative structure is unconventional for a romcom (despite utilizing all of the genre's common tropes). It's anyone's guess, but a lot of people are concerned about a self destructive ""nobody wins"" ending.  Q4: She is similar to Minorin in some ways, but she is vastly more mature than her. Yui is the glue that holds the club together, and she is afraid that altering her position by confessing will ultimately destroy their relationships (and not just between the Service Club). I, personally, am hopeful, as her recent developments are pointing towards her making a stand (something Kushieda never did in ToraDora) so we will see where this direction is headed. Watari may be cruel, but he's logical.   EDIT: As to your last question: she knows what Hachiman is doing because she cares about him, and she is correct in assuming he's doing it to remove himself for his mistake in denying Yukino a chance to run. Hmm. Now that I think about it, Yukino's miscommunication during the presidency problem is basically the reason why 8man ends up growing so close to Iroha. Had she been clear, Iroha would have barely been involved with Hachiman and not won the election. But drama happens so"
OreGairuSNAFU,3afq9c,Enigmaboob,2,Fri Jun 19 20:05:57 2015 UTC,"I think your answers are pretty much all right, but doesn't Hachiman choose to take Iroha's request alone also because Yukino wanted to be president and it wouldn't be fitting to have her help with something that Hachiman prevented her from doing? In a sense I think it's also because of Yukino because it would be cruel to have her help"
OreGairuSNAFU,3afq9c,Madagrey,3,Sat Jun 20 02:21:28 2015 UTC,I think it is because he feels guilty. It is a problem he created using his methods. Parts of this season put a focus on his methods.
OreGairuSNAFU,3afq9c,razor150,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:02:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wasn't saying that it wasn't because Hachiman felt guilty, I agreed with that already. I was saying it was also because he was looking out for Yukino, since Enigmaboob said it had nothing to do with Yukino. Key word in my post was ""also"""
OreGairuSNAFU,3afq9c,Madagrey,2,Sat Jun 20 15:44:57 2015 UTC,"I'll base my answers on how it was explained in the light novels, but I'll try not to spoil details too much:   Hachiman helps out Iroha on his own because he felt guilty for putting her in that position. That and because he thought that Yukinoshita wants to be the SC President, it'll be too cruel to ask this request from her As of episode 12, the show is already ahead of the novel (volume 11 is delayed to June 24th instead of the 18th). Where did you find volume 11 online? I'd like to read that as well... I can't speak for the GENERAL CONSENSUS how they want the show to end, but my opinion is in the minority so I'll refrain for now Again, you're correct. In terms of reading people emotionally, she boasts that she can sense the mood amongst groups --- hence, when she notices that Hachiman and Yukino are becoming aware of each other, she kindly backs off for the sake of their friendship Right again. At the time, the Service Club are in a stasis, and all 3 of them are aware of this. Yui was thinking for the sake of the club in that they should tackle Iroha's request as a group, and hopefully in solving the issue, it would also solve their problems among each other. ""All this"" refers to the empty discussions that they were talking about at the time Re: your 2nd edit - that is a smile of resignation. She felt that anything she does will be shot down anyway with an even better solution that Hachiman thinks of, hence she just lets him do his thing. This will be explained in a later episode. Yukino is the type of person who will act if there is a reason to act. She will help if someone asks for it. She will run for SC president if all signs point that she is needed as SC president. Hachiman removed that reason in the last request   Hope this helps!"
OreGairuSNAFU,3afq9c,GranZero,3,Fri Jun 19 20:17:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! You had a very intuitive answer and it really helped me wrap my head around things. I had another question for both of you hopefully (enigmaboob as well, your answers helped too!). I am used to romantic comedies being straight forward in explaining the characters feelings through their dialogue and interactions. However, episode 8's last 10 minutes completely destroyed my brain and while I have some idea of what transpired I wanted confirmation on what I was thinking.  Is what Hachiman says during this period in episode 8 him confessing his ROMANTIC feelings for both girls or is it just him admitting that he needs them for the first time? And what is the catalyst that causes Yui and Yukino to both cry? Is it the fact that the group has finally come to terms on how they see each other? Or is it Hachiman revealing his feelings? On top of all those questions, did Yukino run from the room because she realizes her inner feelings for Hachiman are reciprocated by him? Or does she run because she doesn't want to confront the problems that were plaguing the relationships in the service club? Basically I am a lost soul needing an analysis of that scene in episode 8. Thanks again for your great answers and helping me understand! (praying for YukinoXHachiman ending)  Edit: Sorry for being a dunce about this but I'm used to stuff like Toradora and Nisekoi where it is blatantly obvious that the girls like the MC. In this show neither of them ever says, even all the way into season 2, with words that they like/love Hachiman. Yes it is implied, and yes its quite apparent that they both like him but I can't read through the lines of their dialogue to see the connections being made and I feel like I'm missing half the show. It's like interpreting a poem for an English exam and you are hoping your interpretation is right. Just thought I should explain why I am being so annoying with these questions. Thanks again!"
OreGairuSNAFU,3afq9c,GranZero,3,Fri Jun 19 20:54:27 2015 UTC,"One thing to note is that OreGairu isn't your typical romcom --- it involves a lot of facades and true selves. For episode 8 in particular, disregard romance for a moment and their actions and dialogue will start to make sense. As for your questions:   Hachiman wasn't confessing his romantic feelings towards Yukino and Yui. He's trying to explain what he wants (genuine thing) to both of them, and it's very difficult because he doesn't know if it exists or not. His frustration manifests in him crying in front of them Yui hates the state the club is in right now, hence her crying. It started with Hachiman's attempt in explaining his desire for that genuine thing. Yukino didn't understand what Hachiman meant, because it cannot be explained by mere logic. (This is why she runs upstairs)   The immediate problem is that Hachiman needed their help in resolving the Christmas Event issue. In order to get their help though, their own issues with each other needed to be resolved first. All 3 of them are avoiding stepping on each others' toes, not wanting to hurt each other. This ends up being a facade to keep up a false relationship. In this episode, Hachiman realizes that what he wanted in this club is to share that sickening desire for that genuine thing with the two. He avoided doing this at first because he doesn't want Yui and Yukino to get hurt/hated like him. Yukino could not understand this desire for the genuine thing no matter what logic she applies. Yui could not understand either, but she was integral in this episode in keeping the group together.  This episode and volume is the climax of the whole series, so understanding it is very difficult, but at the same time, very rewarding.  Check out other threads regarding episode 8, as many others wrote down more thorough analyses than mine: http://redd.it/36trhq http://redd.it/36uiga"

OreGairuSNAFU,3afq9c,RalphZiggy,3,Fri Jun 19 22:03:21 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way about watching this show: confused by the characters feelings and actions. however, it is much more rewarding than typical romcoms because you get insight into human interactions and growth. I think reading the discussion threads on r/anime are really helpful (all those long essays) as well as following a few blogs . I personally recommend reading b0bduh's blog or geekorner because they explain and analyze the show really well! I hope that's helpful"
OreGairuSNAFU,3aec1r,manamono,7,Fri Jun 19 12:51:48 2015 UTC,"Haruno is awesome, she's trying to break their safe zone cause it's not genuine. She wants them to be real to each other cause if they don't they'll both end up hurting each other, she knows that Yukino and Yui has feelings for Hachiman and Haruno is trying to save hachiman as well. a.k.a BatGirl Besides Haruno thinks 1 step ahead, she knows what she's doing. She and Hiratsuga Sensei knows their situation and they're both trying different Methods on them and wanting same results. that's my PoV."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aec1r,Jmqt,3,Fri Jun 19 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"She and Hiratsuka Sensei knows their situation and they're both trying different Methods on them and wanting same results.   Wish more people saw it this way instead of flat out hating Haruno's character. She's literally trying a different method of breaking down their shells, albeit in a more direct/aggressive way (which probably works better than sensei's passiveness sometimes). As an older sibling, Haruno's frustration with her younger sister's motivations actually makes a lot of sense to me."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aec1r,Enigmaboob,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yea idk as well why they hate Haruno. Sometimes reading how they move (Thank god it's animated) will get additional info on what they're really trying to do. Haruno really cares about those 3, that's why she keeps butting in."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aec1r,Jmqt,3,Sat Jun 20 04:23:32 2015 UTC,You are forgetting the most important part of the title. SNAFU For those who don't know  That pretty much describes this episode perfectly and Haruno is calling 8man and friends out on the bs that 8man used to privately think about Hayama and his clique. And of course she has do it in the most painful way possible to make them squirm because reasons.  edit: just noticed why is the spoiler tag in r/anime /s but here it's #s ?
OreGairuSNAFU,3aec1r,doominator10,3,Fri Jun 19 15:28:46 2015 UTC,Man I just really don't get Haruno character... Is she good or evil?  Like she has good intentions but her means of doing it are just one of the most badest ways possible that may break their relationship as a whole. OR she's only doing cause she's bored and 8man's group isn't boring but is starting to become boring so she decided to stir up some trouble for the sake of her having fun. I just can't get my finger on her... really hope they talk more about her in the volume 11.  8man just nails the coffin on her thou about her making you confront things you don't want to yet.
OreGairuSNAFU,3aec1r,KitKatxz,6,Fri Jun 19 13:15:05 2015 UTC,"She's actually very perceptive and is acting, in my opinion, not necessarily with malicious intent. However, like you said, she's doing it in the most confrontational way possible (probably because it is the easiest way to affect Yukino) which is not necessarily good for the group as it exposes their weak understandings of one another. Thing is, unless Watari gives us some more background on her, she is basically a plot device at the moment. Gotta love her dynamic with 8man though, she's probably the most compelling onee-chan figure I've seen in anime thus far :P"
OreGairuSNAFU,3aec1r,Enigmaboob,4,Fri Jun 19 13:49:20 2015 UTC,"I feel that this post by u/wowthatscooliguess sums up Haruno's intentions fairly well. If you think about it from his point of view, it's like Haruno is villainizing herself just as Hachiman used to in order to tear down the facade of the group.   I believe Haruno’s motive is to ultimately test Hachiman to see how far he’ll go for Yukino and her happiness, knowing full well that Yukino’s been left hanging by the people she’s trusted/looked up to in the past. Because of what happened in the past, she doesn’t agree with Hachiman and Yukino’s dynamic, considering it to only be Yukino depending on someone else for stability. While it’s easy to take Haruno’s actions as malicious, I think underneath the surface she does what she does out of care for her sister. She just doesn’t want to see her get hurt all over again. I only hope that she’s open to being wrong in her presumptions, because I believe what Hachiman and Yukino have is real. And if I’m being honest, she’s the only one that can realistically protect Yukino from their mother. She will need to become the trio’s ally. They will to lean on her at some point in the future."
OreGairuSNAFU,3aeswx,VelkejKocour,7,Fri Jun 19 15:21:45 2015 UTC,Hachiman's reaction was actually totally different in the novel: he was very passive about the situation and looked out a window in the cafe in the LN. I understood it as his way of shrugging off responsibility (and was kind of a reversion to his old usual self in that moment). He was angry that he was used as a lure for Yukino and was suspicious of Hayato's intentions/past relationship with Yukino.
OreGairuSNAFU,3aeswx,Enigmaboob,3,Fri Jun 19 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"True,  also the L.N showed us how that scene ended, when Yui and Hachiman followed the sad Yukino to the door and gave her the birthday presents,  which made her happy.  Which this was omitted from the anime.   Edit: Fixed spelling"
OreGairuSNAFU,3aeswx,paladinmahdi,3,Fri Jun 19 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"I like how creatos of show arent saying things directly but making plenty clues (That something happened between Hayato and Yukino is indicated already in s01e02), so I wanted more Thank you for your answers, it actually made me more satisfied.

The one biggest thing the whole anime skipped is the hilarious inner monologues of 8man.  If you want to read it, go to kyakka.wordpress.com, the Hayato ark is volume 10. I suggest reading the LNs on the go with your smartphone/tablet, it's a great way to kill some time."

But it's probably not the answer that's longed for. Things I want and things that are longed for are very similar so why are they so different? Honestly, it's fine even if it's a lie.    A look inside of Yui Yuigahama's head. Throughout the episode she seemed irked when people looked down on her for being ""Yui-like"". The dumb but nice girl everyone knows but she's more than that and not even Hachiman or Yukino try to look beyond that. Actually the three has been avoiding the genuine thing until Haruno shoved it in their face. While Hachiman and Yukino hated Hayama's group because of that they became just that. Anyways back to Yui.    The things I want and the things that are longed for are different.    So what does Yui want and what's being longed for? What's being longed for is the genuine thing of course but we still don't know what Yui wants that's so similar to that. I want to say it's a friendship where you don't necessarily know the real person like Hayama's group because of the last line but something about that doesn't sit right with me. Maybe it's because, like I said, she seemed to be bothered by people calling what she does as ""Yui-like"". I guess we'll find out. I like how Yui is becoming relevant in the story again after Iroha pushed her away."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,selectives,8,Fri Jun 19 02:18:12 2015 UTC,"The way I saw that quote and considering today's episode was that in Yui's perspective she was like the nice person who never wins. Which is ironic due to the saying ""nice guys finish last.""  In turn she is suffering like Hayama where no one really understands her and misinterpretation her actual feelings.   Yui's kindness is too much to the point where she makes self-sacrifices. Considering what she said, she is probably going to make a move to solve the love triangle dilemma the trio has right now because if it drags on any longer nothing but bitterness and jealousy will ensue and bring down the friendships."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,DarkWorld97,5,Fri Jun 19 11:52:49 2015 UTC,I really hope next episode changes the status quo for our 3 heroes. I hope Yui takes that next step that Ebina avoided and Iroha tried to do.

OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,DarkWorld97,3,Sun Jun 21 18:44:53 2015 UTC,Yui's character is rooted in giving up things to live up to others' expectations. The next episode has to show some form of growth.
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,RalphZiggy,4,Sun Jun 21 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe she values Yukino's growth more than her own; she doesn't have hangups about making relationships with people, more fish in the sea for her if she wants boyfriend at some future date.

I want to compare my translation of Yui's monologue to his because mine's feels shoddy.   Anyways to slightly elaborate on what you said YukiMILF said that she wanted Yukino to live freely as herself and seems to imply that Hachiman and Yui are anchoring her down. Haruno also seems to share this view with her and even went as far as being hated on purpose to fulfill this. Haruno seems to be tethered to the family by making appearances and living up to the family name so she hides behind her facade and doesn't have a chance to express her real self. However Yukino has this chance to be free and is blowing it by following Haruno's footsteps and now Hachiman's.

Then again, there are only two subjects here (past and present yukino), so does anyone know if the kanji 最 was used in the Japanese?  If it was I'm pretty sure it'd appear in the Chinese as well."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,LadWatcherIsHere,5,Fri Jun 19 06:11:08 2015 UTC,"I never use subs for translation. I use pronunciation instead.

OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,RalphZiggy,3,Fri Jun 19 06:38:44 2015 UTC,"I took Yukimom's meaning another way, say she's she was willing to give Yukino a chance living by herself and doing things by herself; but doesn't like her choosing career path against family plans, staying out late with friends.....in other words, she' a control freak who won't really give Yukino her freedom.  Hachiman needs to burn that witch down."

But she probably knows that Hachiman doesn't feel the same way about her. Both of them seek a genuine relationship hence ""similar"" But the difference is the relationship with who."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,guyofred,6,Fri Jun 19 05:06:22 2015 UTC,"That also sounds plausible. I feel like an idiot for not even considering romance since this, in the end, is still a romcom. She probably even noticed the chemistry between the two from when the bowl fell so she looked upset. Yui is good at picking up subtle social cues, after all."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,LadWatcherIsHere,16,Fri Jun 19 05:15:47 2015 UTC,"Yukinoshita Haruno makes you pick up on things you go on ignoring. -Hikigaya Hachiman  Seems like this will be the title of the chapter where the Valentine Event happens. Haruno is moving the strings to make the plot progress:   She tried to cause a scene by making a loud comment about how Yukino once gave chocolates to Hayato, luckily Hayato stops her. Not satisfied, she went to Yukino and this time it worked. Thanks to the scene that was caused, she got a summary of the current situation of the Service Club by looking at the trio's reactions. Clever girl. She pointed out that none of the members of the Service Club is being honest with themselves. Yukino is no longer seeking independence and is pushing her ideas aside because she's too busy dealing with her new found feelings for Hachiman. Yui is no longer moving by feelings but logic instead. The old Yui would have accepted Hachiman's invitation but she rejected him to protect the status quo. And finally Hachiman is trying to get closer to both girls by actually being nice and making moves on both, something that, in Haruno's eyes, is not the real Hachiman or at least, not entertaining at all. She told Yukimom about Yukino's career choice to ensure that their mom would be at Yukino's home fully knowing that Yui and Hachiman would be there to witness everything.   Haruno feels they're stuck. They're following a superficial daily routine. And this is wrong so she's trying to fix in the only ways he knows. But that's the thing. Haruno's... schemes have never been easy to deal with.  EDIT: Hachiman's monologue at the end... I feel like this is his counter argument to Haruno's entire scheme. She views the current Service Club as wrong. But wait! Who put the parameter? Who is she to decide what's wrong and what's right? This extends to everyone else. And if such thing way of thinking exists, then, is it really possible for something genuine to exist?"

Who put the parameter? Who is she to decide what's wrong and what's right? This extends to everyone else. And if such thing way of thinking exists, then, is it really possible for something genuine to exist?   I feel like we have to remember two thins here:    Hachiman's monologue about betraying his ideals, when he was faced with the contradictions between the ideals he had formed about loneliness, not trusting people and superficial relationships being completely fake and not genuine, thus, hating them. Hiratsuka's conversation this episode, she mentioned expectations being betrayed, she noticed the change in Hachiman's perspective, she saw what Haruno saw as well.   I think this is important because, even if it wasn't mentioned in this episode, this is still a conflict inside Hachiman, that has been brought up now, remember how only a couple episodes ago he was upset because Hayama helped him, he was defending his loneliness, now he's in the same situation as Hayama? How'd that end?   I believe Haruno's just trying to avoid what's already coming, the same conflicts in the Hayama group will, soon, come upon Hachiman group, but they' not as strong, they're not as capable of handling that sort of situations, specially Yukino, since Hachiman is not outside of the situation, since he's not an observer anymore, but an actor, he can't see the whole picture, he (just like Yukino and Yui) has forgotten his past self, his past ideals and Haruno feels like bringing those back to Hachiman is the only way their relationship will truly be guine."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,buttcream,5,Fri Jun 19 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I drew this connection right away. I think some people would benefit from a second watch of season one. Because just like the audience has, Hachiman has forgotten his code in exchange for this facade. The first scene in the show is a monologue from Hachiman about how youth is a lie, and how people who wrap themselves up in that lie disgust him. He's completely forgone his code for sake of ""The real thing"", which turned out to be a lie. That's the eternal struggle of human relationships and the theme of the show. To be true is to be alone and to lie is to be together. Everyone has to choose to either be true to themselves and end up alone, or lie to themselves and end up with others. Hachiman used to wear this philosophy like armour. He loved only himself and that made him strong and true. But he has forgotten that, and now that Haruno has thrown his logic back at him in the very armour he used to tout himself, people see her as evil. She's not evil, she's reminding the group of the truth that hachiman reminded other characters of in the exact same way (remember episode 12 of season 1 when he pointed to that dumb girl that she was weak and attention seeking? Same thing with Haruno)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,DaniSenpai,4,Sat Jun 20 09:56:43 2015 UTC,"That's the eternal struggle of human relationships and the theme of the show. To be true is to be alone and to lie is to be together. Everyone has to choose to either be true to themselves and end up alone, or lie to themselves and end up with others.   I think I'm gonna save that quote, it's pretty good.   Yes, the problem with Haruno is that she doesn't act as directly as Hachiman does, she doesn't just come up to you, tells you how meaningless you are and walks away, her plans are more complex, but in the end she does what she thinks it's best for the others (and to entertain herself)  I've already said this before, but we're drawing conclusions about Yukino's family without knowing how they really are, all we know is that Yukino hates them, Yukimom seems to care about Yukinon and Haruno is unpredictable, then why are they separated? Why is Yukimom scarier than Haruno?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,buttcream,3,Sat Jun 20 13:24:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I made it up last night while writing that!  I think Haruno really does care about Yukino a lot. Their family seems a bit disjointed. I don't know anyone who had an apartment in 10th grade that their parents paid for, and that tells me that they aren't that close with each other. It seems like Yukimom is kind of a control freak when it comes to her kids. Evidence being Haruno being the walmart greeter of the Yukinoshita family. As well as dictating the career path of yukinon. In any case I would still like to learn more about Yukinon's family life."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,DaniSenpai,5,Sat Jun 20 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"As I've said before, we don't know if her family is as she describes, Haruno being the one who attends most events makes sense from a cultural stand point, the elder sister is the one who has been around the most, the one who was (originally) going to inherit everything, so she being the one present in all events makes sense.   Why isn't Yukino attending? Right now she doesn't want to, but Haruno explained in the LN's that it wouldn't be good for the company to have both sisters always attending, that would make it seem like they're competing for the spot.   About Yukimom being a control freak, art isn't seen as a viable career, it's risky and even here, in the other side of the world, parents hesitate when their children tell them they want to study arts, so she being concerned about that choice is understandable.   So far it seems to me like Yukino is just a rebel, she didn't enjoy being the ""second one"", she was always behind her older sister and always trying to do as she did, which I can understand, but so far it doesn't seem like her family is all that bad.  Comparing to Toradora again:"
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,buttcream,3,Sat Jun 20 22:53:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Everything you just said is true. My saying that Yukimom seems like a control freak pertains more to how she responded to Yukinon's decision as a ""mistake"" on her part. It just seems a bit more attached to her daughters future. It seems less like she is trying to guide her to a more suitable career path and more like she's disappointed that her daughter could make such a juvenile mistake (even if she does feel more of the former, the latter is still clearly present judging from her delivery). More than that, it's as if she doesn't believe Yukinon has any forward thinking whatsoever. The fact that she refers to her choice as ""a mistake of [her] own"" tells me that she doesn't even consider the possibility of a deviation from what she expects from her daughter. I'd also like to say, as an aside, that I'm not projecting my own problems onto this observation. I'm just puzzling out Yukimom's character by the way she acts on-screen."

It seems less like she is trying to guide her to a more suitable career path and more like she's disappointed that her daughter could make such a juvenile mistake   I can't say that couldn't be it, maybe she thought she had raised Yukino to be different, we know the Yukino we know now is not the one we once knew, the Yukino from S1 said that she would go for science, but switching to arts does seem a little odd, specially if you look at her, her personality and her abilities, Haruno probably told her mother how that decision was not based on an actual choice, but rather so she could maintain the trio for as long as possible (Hayama problem)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,iskow,3,Sun Jun 21 01:29:45 2015 UTC,"More than that, it's as if she doesn't believe Yukinon has any forward thinking whatsoever.   Not sure if you're an LN reader, but another example of how Yukimom sees Yukino would be when she assumed Yuigahama was Haruno's friend instead of Yukino when they first met. It's like she didn't even think Yukino could have friends outside of Hayama. It's like she cares about Yukino, but has given up on her at the same time. At least, that's the vibe I'm getting. She probably thinks her daughter is some sort of social invalid or something."

And after that we see our cute little devil in an apron. YES!  Haciman is served his sweetest rejection yet, followed by some cute spoonfeeding!  Yes, yes it is!. I'm dying of diabetes!  The Yukinoshita family subplot continues this episode. For me, Haruno is the most interesting character in the series. All of her thoughts and intentions are hidden underneath so many masks, that it's hard to know who she really is. In fact, she herself wonders if anything is genuine at all.   Her care for Yukino is genuine, that's what I think, but the way she interacts with her can be seen as cruel by many. She wants her little sister to grow up and stand on her own, to not latch on to other people for support, like she did with Haruno before, and is doing with Hachiman now.   Speaking of him, it's a lot easier for Haruno to make him move forward with just a couple of words, while for Yukinon she needs to resort to measures which are sometimes too drastic. That's why she is willing to take the role of the villain and force her little sister to change. Calling their mother may have been her strongest effort yet, and even that did not succeed. What is left for her now is obviously to get more personally involved.  The perception we have of others and the way they want us to see them may be very different at times. This is where Hachiman and Haruno's  ideals differ. And this is also the theme for the second subplot of the episode.  The other subplot is of course Yui's internal struggle. This is another interesting character which we honestly do not know much about. It is easy to label her as the airhead, clumsy member of the group, but she's far more than that. The way she wants to act and the way she is perceived are different. In a way she is like Hayato, hence she can understand him better, which she also briefly mentioned in this episode.     After seeing her two friends come closer than before, both with obvious feeling of affection for each other, she becomes depressed. Her conflicting feelings of romantic love and love for her friends tear her apart. She is unsure of what to do so rejects Hachiman's invitation early on. The pain only increases as she slowly realizes that if this keeps up, her best two friends might end up going out and Yukinon will snatch the one she has loved for so long. Haruno's teasing doesn't help things either and she is pushed to her limit, yet is unwilling to act just yet, as it may be unfair.   Unfair how? Not exactly sure. Perhaps she was waiting for Yukinon to catch up, so they both could fight with open hearts for Hachiman's affection. Perhaps she thinks that by taking Hachiman away, Yukinon will feel betrayed, and she cares too much to ever do that.  We'll get to see her decision next episode as she laments about all of this in her monologue after the ending credits.  Jeez, this was a long one. Sorry for the wall of text guys, and for whoever read it till the end here's a sad Yui. Please let me know what your opinions are and if there were any flaws in my reasoning.  Edit: Grammar."

Perhaps she was waiting for Yukinon to catch up, so they both could fight with open hearts for Hachiman's affection. Perhaps she thinks that by taking Hachiman away, Yukinon will feel betrayed, and she cares too much to ever do that.   I already talked more about it here but I feel that Yui isn't waiting for Yukino to catch up, but she simply gave up, she should know that there'sno such thing as fairness in this, she should know that Yukino isn't stopping for her, so why didn't she accept Hachiman's offer to walk home? Why did she hesitate when he asked about her plans? Because she cares too much about them, she'd rather take on all the sadness, all the pain and see them both happy, just like Hayama, she isn't putting herself first, she's taking care of the weak and fragile Yukino, while she just cries inside.   It has been mentioned many times in this sub now, but she is by far the most mature out of the three of them and (this one I'm adding) one of the most mature characters in the series, surpassed only by the experience of Hiratsuka and the tricky cleverness of Haruno."

They're both pretty smart, and I think it'd be pretty cool if they maintained a friendship after high school."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,Jiraex,10,Fri Jun 26 10:59:52 2015 UTC,Best part of the episode was that we got some visibility on where Hachiman stands in regards to the girls; the part when Haruno blurts out how Yukino had given Hayama chocolate long ago and his resulting eyebrow twitch. Extremely curious what went through his mind during this part in the light novel.
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,doominator10,3,Fri Jun 19 03:17:57 2015 UTC,Most likely he thought something along the lines of 'that's annoying.' 'why do I find that annoying?' 'best not to think to hard about it.'

And someone first having feelings of attraction and being shy  I wouldn't call cowardice. Haruno is trying to push the fast forward button, Hikki should tell her to butt out and let things grow naturally however slow."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,DaniSenpai,7,Fri Jun 19 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"So it's finally out, just when I was thinking about it, just when I was already forming in my head the rant about how we're getting more and more Yukino waifu material thrown at our faces while Yui clearly suffers and no one notices, Haruno comes and just sticks it into everyone's faces, their relationship is not genuine, their interactions are fake and their goals have been stained by this new friendship, this new experience to both Hachiman and Yukino, this isn't a genuine friendship, the girls never really wanted that, this is just a competition, where the prize isn't eve aware.  Now, if I had to compare the way this story is going with another anime We already saw this episode how twice Yui rejected Hachiman, this is not something to pass by, this is important, she has already decided she's not competing for the bowl, she's trying to enjoy the time she has with it while she can, but we can already tell that, sadly, Yukino's getting it, o Iroha, please be Iroha.   On another note isn't Hiratsuka-sensei looking particularly beautiful today? Those lips of hers kept my attention the whole time she was talking with Hachiman.   We also got a bit of Saika, which is good."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,shortofsane,3,Sat Jun 20 16:04:24 2015 UTC,"then there's that sweet, always cheering and always joyful character, no one notices her suffering, no one sees her pain, because she takes it inside.   To be fair, Minori did a lot more to actively hide that she was ever actually feeling any pain.   This is just a competition, where the prize isn't even aware.   He might not know how Yukino feels towards him, or see that there is/was a battle going on for him, but I still believe that 8man does know Yui feels for him. He actively stopped her from confessing after the fireworks when her phone was going off. Even if he doesn't believe those feelings are ""genuine,"" I don't think he doubts that she feels she loves him. She has been dropping hints since the series began after all.   she has already decided she's not competing for the bowl   This is more or less how I saw it as well. Being who she is, she might make one last attempt at him, or she could just go full parallel with the red-headed bae and slowly fade away into the background. I'm actually having quite a bit of trouble predicting what she'll end up doing next episode. Her monologue honestly doesn't even do much to help with that.   If she confesses, I truly look forward to how 8man responds, whether he accepts or rejects her.  If she distances herself, I'd hope to see 8man find her and tell her he wants her around, whether romantically or as a friend. Yukino would probably end up tagging along with him if this were to happen, but it'd be a lot more powerful if he went alone.   I had more on my mind, but at this point I'm overwhelmed by feels, so I think I'm just gonna stop with that for now."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,DaniSenpai,3,Fri Jun 19 16:34:01 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Minori did a lot more to actively hide that she was ever actually feeling any pain.   That's true, but the main character also did more to go after her, they had real conversations and showed to each other how they really are, in this case no one even looks at Yui, every time she's feeling pain it gets overshadowed by Yukino. Yui's shocked because of Hachiman wanting something genuine, BUT WAIT! Yukino's running away. Yui's sad because the club isn't as it used to be, BUT WAIT, all that matters is that Yukino doesn't leave.   But I still do believe she'll end up like that, heck Toradora.   I still believe that 8man does know Yui feels for him.   He's pretty blind, if it wasn't for Komachi he probably wouldn't even talk with the grocery store person. At the moment he's too busy with other aspects of his life to notice Yui, before he was worried about the club status and how he could bring it together, so Yui's confession is out, now that the club is ""back"" and their relationship is ""there"" he's enjoying it, or was enjoying it, now we get another dilemma where he has to decide how to follow his ideals.   Also, Yukino's family, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu and Sankarea."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,shortofsane,4,Sat Jun 20 07:03:02 2015 UTC,"He's pretty blind, if it wasn't for Komachi he probably wouldn't even talk with the grocery store person.

Well yeah, he is pretty blind; he hasn't even noticed that Yukino has a thing for him yet it seems. But he's still been taking steps to appeal to Yui. Him responding, ""someday"" at the amusement park when Yui brought up wanting to go with him again. In this episode alone there are two incidents of him ""making a move"" on Yui, almost mirroring her earlier attempts. He asked if she was free sometime soon, and later offered to walk her home.   For those reasons and more (her almost confession in S1, ""I'm in love"" EP4 Zoku, and literally basically all she does around him), I highly doubt he doesn't know by this point.   Using this as an argument, it isn't hard to take what Haruno said and lace this in with it. Haruno, as you said, blatantly tells them all that they're not genuine; this isn't a true friendship, not anymore. Yui and Yukino are in a battle that could possibly destroy their friendship, all whilst 8man does nothing but appeal to them both to protect the status quo.   Obviously, in order for anything in their lives to have a chance to be genuine, something has to change. Yui is the most likely candidate to change right now, but then again, there's this:   Honestly, it's fine, even if it's a lie.   That sounds to me like she's completely fine going on the way they are, even if it's a lie. Even if she believes in her heart that she'll never feel 8man love her likes she loves him, she doesn't want anything to change because she does care for the both of them. Her situation sucks. If she confesses to 8man, she risks losing both of them, but if they remain silent, she could still lose both of them.   Well, what we do know for a fact given the interviews is that Yui will be making a choice, and given that the interview said that this would take the ""sweet Yui"" somewhere we want to see, I imagine it'll be a pretty big choice. My bets on her pulling the full Minori we've been talking about and sort of fading away, allowing 8man and Yukino to continue. It wouldn't give her any closure, really, but Yui faced a similar circumstance when she saw 8man and Yukino at the mall and thought they must have been dating, and she handled it as would be expected of her character. She wanted to leave; she wanted to avoid the problem and her feelings.  Yui has changed since then, but it looks like she's already taking the steps to avoiding the problem once more having passed up 8man's offer to walk her home.  I dunno, but I feel like we'll know Yui's choice early on in the next episode and we'll see what comes of it through to the end."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,DaniSenpai,5,Sat Jun 20 13:34:49 2015 UTC,"whilst 8man does nothing but appeal to them both to protect the status quo.   Here's the thing, is he really trying to appeal to both of them? A monologue that I think it's often looked by it's the ""I hate nice girls"" one, remember how he stopped trying? How he always confused things? Aren't we now confusing things?  Offering to walk Yui home is not appealing to her, it's courtesy, he walked Yukino to the hotel once and would probably walk her home if the situation ever arises, asking if she's free soon? That could be anything, from Komachi's birthday present (I don't know her birthday) to wanting advice on buying some new shoes, a misunderstanding arose because of the way he asked, why? Because he's not used to that yet, he just wanted to know if she had time for something.   Now, looking at the same monologue from another perspective, isn't he trying to avoid another misunderstanding? We already know Yui's a nice girl, so is Yukino, so are they acting out of niceness? Is this what a genuine relationship is like? He never had a real group of friends, so he doesn't know what that's like, he's never been hit on, so he doesn't know what that's like, what's the safest thing he can do? Assume the least, ""they're just being nice"" is probably what he's thinking.    Yui has changed since then, but it looks like she's already taking the steps to avoiding the problem once more having passed up 8man's offer to walk her home.   Yui has changed, but not completely, she might have recognized the group as part of her, she might now be more honest about her feelings for Hachiman, but the way she didn't enter the infirmary when Hachiman and Yukino were there, the way she ""accepted"" what she thought was a relationship between Hachiman and Yukino in S1, that hasn't changed, she still tries to avoid conflict, she does it with Miura, she did it on the Christmas event planning and she did with Hachiman and Yukino."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,shortofsane,2,Sat Jun 20 17:45:10 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, is he really trying to appeal to both of them? A monologue that I think it's often looked by it's the ""I hate nice girls"" one, remember how he stopped trying? How always confused things? Aren't we now confusing things?   I've used that monologue as an argument several times. I've wrote paragraphs on it. He 'hates' nice girls. Yet he's fallen for many of them. Orimoto wasn't the only one, but she was the only one named. Sure, he's not the same person he used to be, but he's also still hanging around Yui, a girl he considers a 'nice girl,' and treating her with respect and courtesy. Despite the image he tried to maintain early on, he's quite the nice guy himself, with Sensei backing that statement up.   Offering to walk Yui home is not appealing to her, it's courtesy, he walked Yukino to the hotel once and would probably walk her home if the situation ever arises, asking if she's free soon? That could be anything, from Komachi's birthday present (I don't know her birthday) to wanting advice on buying some new shoes, a misunderstanding arose because of the way he asked, why? Because he's not used to that yet, he just wanted to know if she had time for something.   It's partly courtesy, but it also shows a bit of intimacy (maybe friendly, maybe romantic) in both situations. When he walked Yukino to the hotel, and if he had walked Yui home. This all depends on how you interpret 8man's thoughts. If you believe he doesn't know how Yui feels towards him, it's courtesy and friendliness. If you believe he does know, then it's courtesy and appealing to her.   Arguing that it could be anything when it genuinely could be anything doesn't really prove, ahem, anything. Komachi's birthdate is March 3rd, so it is coming up, but we still have no idea what 8man was going to say. Also, advice on buying new shoes? I highly doubt he'd ask for advice on something as trivial as that. Hell, if that's what he'd asking, I'd say it's 100% confirmed he just wants to spend more time with her, lol. Of course, that's not what he asked, he simply asked if she was free. The intentions were unlikely to be romantic, but this delves back into the territory of whether or not he's completely oblivious.   Now, looking at the same monologue from another perspective, isn't he trying to avoid another misunderstanding? We already know Yui's a nice girl, so is Yukino, so are they acting out of niceness? Is this what a genuine relationship is like? He never had a real group of friends, so he doesn't know what that's like, he's never been hit on, so he doesn't know what that's like, what's the safest thing he can do? Assume the least, ""they're just being nice"" is probably what he's thinking.   Not really going to write much here. I agree that he might think Yukino is just being nice as of now, but this is just going to end up back on the topic of how 8man perceives Yui's feelings, so there's not much of a point here.    Yui has changed, but not completely, she might have recognized the group as part of her, she might now be more honest about her feelings for Hachiman, but the way she didn't enter the infirmary when Hachiman and Yukino were there, the way she ""accepted"" what she thought was a relationship between Hachiman and Yukino in S1, that hasn't changed, she still tries to avoid conflict, she does it with Miura, she did it on the Christmas event planning and she did with Hachiman and Yukino.   I'm not sure what you're arguing here. I agreed with you. Hence my ""but it looks like she's already taking the steps to avoiding the problem once more...""   EDIT: Just going to add that 8man might not necessarily believe that Yui's feeings towards him are genuinely romantic, he might believe she's just being nice, but I think he at least knows that SHE thinks she's doing more than just that for him."
OreGairuSNAFU,3acsme,DaniSenpai,3,Sat Jun 20 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"I've used that monologue as an argument several times. I've wrote paragraphs on it.    I'm actually kinda sad I haven't seen them, it's one of my (if not the most) favorite monologues in the series and in the time I've been in this sub I haven't seen it mentioned even once. Note that I joined this sub about episode 3 or 4 of S2.   This all depends on how you interpret 8man's thoughts. If you believe he doesn't know how Yui feels towards him, it's courtesy and friendliness. If you believe he does know, then it's courtesy and appealing to her.    I think you sealed it with this, we don't really know what his stand is on this situation. Saying that anything can't be proved, doesn't prove anything, but neither do our assumptions, this is all we've been doing (and basically what this sub does), assume based on how we interpret the series, the characters and their actions.    Also, advice on buying new shoes? I highly doubt he'd ask for advice on something as trivial as that.    I didn't mean literally asking her to buy shoes, what I wanted to say is that it could've been anything, not necessarily romantic as you said.    Komachi's birthday is March 3rd   Will be disappointed if we don't get an OVA for this.    but I think he at least knows that SHE thinks she's doing more than just that for him.   Agreed."

As Haruno said, the one who's playing the villain and the unsung hero of the series, they're just circling around each other not wanting to face what's truly genuine. Hachiman already knows what's truly happening: that both girls have fallen for him, but he chooses not to face it because of his fear of disrupting the status quo. Ironic enough, this is what they hated about Hayato in the first place.  They will disrupt the status quo, they will create a gap between each other; that much I am sure of.

Didn't expect Haruno to turn on 8man like that, though.  Now he's ""boring"" too.  Can see why Yukinoshita was so desperate to get away from her family now.  There was up til this point an outside possibility that she was simply being willful and unreasonable in her relationship to her family, but that is some brutal emotional manipulation...   So what did Haruno tell her mother, exactly?  8man didn't tell her what Yukino told him about her career survey, unless that's something that occurs early on in Volume 11, and seems out of character in any case.  So where did she get her information from, assuming she didn't just make shit up?  And for that matter, where did she hear about their effort at seeking out ""something genuine?""  Iroha was the only other person who saw that...  Have we heard that music before in the series?  The somber track playing after Yukinomama leaves?  It sounds familiar, but at the same time I don't remember where I might have heard it before... maybe its a variation on another leitmotif."

Everyone had changed since the beginning. Everyone is a new persona adjusting and slowly building this ""genuine"" relationship that they have going on. As of this time, however, I believe 8man is struggling to even confirm if what they are building is even genuine.  I think we can all see that everyone is the complete opposite of who they were in the beginning. 8man has betrayed many of his ideals from season 1 and is now working with the very things he hated to chase after something he can't even confirm is there. Thus, he is suffering from an internal struggle thanks to the reminder given by Haruno.  Yukinoshita is in the same position but slightly different. She was always the rational thinker and pushed everything else aside. She also wants something genuine and was also very self reliant in that quest. However now she is relying on Yui and 8man a lot these days. She wants a lot of opinion from them and her choices are affected by the people around her. This being another issue of ""Is anything truly genuine?"" Compared to the past Yukino, this is what Haruno is scared of and trying to accomplish. She wants the old Yukino.  And Yui. She was always controlled by her emotions until recently. I guess you could say that 8man speech in episode 8 (wow the coincidence?) was the genesis of it all. Now she thinks the way Yukinon did a while back. She is very rational and accepting of the situations she has perceived. This is exemplified in her denial of 8man's invitation to walk her home.  Everyone is changing.  Which goes back to the original question: Where is the real us?  Well that is what the gang is struggling with. The real them and the ""fake"" them are in a constant battle right now. They are chasing something but it's built from lies. It's not genuine. And they question if that is something that THEY want. Their real selves have left already and they are different. Are their new selves the REAL ones? And are the desires from the new selves their REAL desires? Who decides that? What is real? Who defines what is real for us and what is not?  This is how I saw it. I wonder how Yui will handle this."

It'll probably be updated later when I'm certain of what is said in scenes (not completely certain of what Haruno says midway through the episode and the talk before Yumiko comes in).     Well, we're now in uncharted territory since the next few episodes are covering volume 11. Now everyone is a secondary, just like Game of Thrones.   We start the episode with a shortened version of the ending to volume 10. I'm sad there's no book, but oh well. This scene is really important since it confirms that there's still a huge problem in Yukino & Hachiman's relationship. It's one that is built on dependence/reliance, which is not healthy. Even though I don't agree with Haruno's methods, I do agree that Yukino needs to learn how to do things on her own. Kinda ironic that she's in a club dedicated to solving problems, but can't actually solve them on her own.   Dat bounce. Nice to see a throwback to the first moments of the series, which was Yui wanting to make cookies for a guy she likes. Now we get to do the same thing again, and hopefully this time, Yui's chocolates are good.   Hachiman making moves. Immediately after, Yui seems depressed after looking at the club door. It must really suck knowing that another girl has stolen the heart of the guy you like.   I really want to know how Iroha managed to worm her way into becoming an unofficial member of the club. And Iroha hears Komachi's name for the first time. I can't wait for the showdown between those two. Also, Iroha should be happy Hachiman is a bit of a siscon.    Ebina pls go.  It's pretty fun to see these two fight. Too bad we all know who always wins.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY YUI!  Glad to see Jazz-hands is back. This animu felt dead without him.  I really missed this expression. It was cute here and hilarious here.  WE GOT MORE KEIKA! So sweet to hear her first (and only) line in the anime.  Another glorious rejection, followed by a surprise attack.  Pretty funny seeing everyone react in this scene, including Jazz-hands. If only Orimoto was actually a contender in the 8bowl.   Classic, both go to pick up the object and get flustered, scene. Again, this series does something standard, but we all still love it.   Master B-Baller Yui. And here I thought she sucks at cooking. She was probably that kid who played with all the pots and pans instead of actually cooking.  NTR happening before our very eyes.  Yukimom makes her second appearance. I told you she was like Cersei. But I kinda agree when she disapproved of Yukino coming back late at night. Only the biggest sluts stay up late to make chocolates for the guy she likes. /s   Yui rejected Hachiman's offer to walk her home. It's hard to keep watching this suffering ;_;   Yui got a solo ED, and on her birthday too. BRAVO FEEL.   What Yui says in the preview worries me. It sounds like major suffering is gonna happen next episode.   All I can say in terms of what this adapted is that it's volume 11 stuff, excluding that pre-OP scene (that was the last chapter of volume 10). Next week should be more volume 11 stuff.   As always, I'm willing to answer any and all Oregairu related questions."

Unless you think the best course of action here is for Yui to just bottle up her feelings and never let Hachiman know what she feels in a way that cannot be logic'ed away by Hachiman   Way to just assume things. I was just pointing out that you guys really can't talk about just letting things happen, considering it's only positive for you. Anyway, 8man already knows about Yui. He is just in denial that it could ever happen. He was hurt from Orimoto, so he now refuses to believe that anyone could like him. It's willful ignorance."

Well ok, let's not do that.  If it's Japanese Valentines chocolate with confession he'll have until White Day in March to reply......so it could be a cliffhanger after a Yui confession while he overthinks what to do (Yui's waited on him before, eh?)  Then Haruno will up the ante by moving in with Yukino for a while, and  invite Hachiman and Yui over to put the thumb screws on them all. Hikki will be like Sousuke in Full Metal Panic with Teletha Testarossa and Kaname in the apartment; a basket case fit to be tied"

Oh, and that moe girl is also the superior officer of his superior officer!

Considering we're near the end of the novel, I feel like we don't have the time to wait (unless we get a timeskip end or a friendship end). Also since this would be pretty major character development as well, I feel like it should be happening soon, and it'll probably involve Yukino's family.   I agree with what you said if this was the real world, but we're near the end of a series and this is character development that we either see now or never."

This series had left a bigger impression on me by episode five of the first season than most ever do. The first two episodes of Zoku left me speechless, and episode 8 of Zoku actually had me me tearfully smiling, something only two other shows have accomplished (The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya (Kyon's Choice) and Tokyo Ghoul (Episode 12 of Season 1) for anyone curious).   I really don't want to see such a likable cast's story come to an end. Yukino's blunt comments that always made me laugh, Iroha's rejections, 8man's monologues, and Yui's genuineness..  So many feels.   Really not ready for this.  Damn it.  On a less emotional note, if 8man's VA sings for the last episode (and does it well), I think I'll be able to die happily."

Each person has a specific way how they call others:  Hachiman - calls the others just by their last names (Yukinoshita, Yuigahama, Isshiki, etc.)  Yui - she has her own...naming system that is both cute and horrible by her friends' standards (Hikki, Yukinon, Sai-chan, etc.)  Yukino - the most proper of them all, she puts -kun or -san at the end of their last names (Hikigaya-kun, Yuigahama-san, etc.)  Iroha - because she's a first-year, she puts -senpai after all of the other characters' last names, with the notable exception of Hachiman who she just refers to as Senpai  I like how each character is differentiated by their speech as well, and you'll see more as you read/watch further. Enjoy~  Edit: As /u/Taiboss mentioned, I initially mentioned that Hachiman calls Totsuka by his first name, which is incorrect."

Starting a job, learning to interact with others on a daily basis has led me to the question on multiple occasions, ""What am I looking for out of this?"", what reason do I have for even doing the things i do everyday, why do i even try to understand others, they certainly don't understand me, so what's the point. I always had the same concept, even thinking up the idea of asking a girl out on a date, my first reaction was what do i gain and what if I or she gets hurt out of it? Damage seems to be a focal point for isolation aforementioned in the article, same as fake kindness, am i shown kindness as forced guilt or real empathy. And i just want to understand... I really really do, I feel like I'm growing up in this world as i mature, but i always look back in my isolated, cynical state. I want to grow up, i want to care for others and understand, but it all seems fake at the end of the day. I want something genuine.  Anyways, sorry for the jumbled mess, im on mobile.

OreGairuSNAFU,3a69nb,shortofsane,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:41:00 2015 UTC,"But here's the thing and it was a hard pill to swallow. I am a Yui fan/fag but I realize now that she is the most truly strong in the group and therefore most likely to land on her feet irrespective of circumstance. Yukino is way more vulnerable deep down and therefore the best ending available is that Hachiman becomes something of a pillar for Yukino (whatever that involves). Yui has recovered from 8man's strikes multiple times on her own because she is strong, Yukino almost broke up the group when Hachi hurt her. I know it sucks but it's likely going to be for the best of the most people when the (sadly) predictable ending comes.  Besides, then you can have Yui."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a69nb,Enigmaboob,7,Thu Jun 18 08:58:37 2015 UTC,"You've stated exactly why I don't want Yukino and 8man together. She's become/becoming incredibly reliant on her relationship with 8man. Hell, she asked him to save her ""someday."" If she needs him with her to be okay, that's not a healthy relationship because she can hardly stand on her own.    Yui, on the other hand, doesn't rely on 8man at this point in the story. She wants him to be happy, but given her personality, I doubt she needs him to be happy. She is the strongest of the three, which is why I'm root for Yui and 8man till the end despite the odds. She doesn't need him, she wants him.  EDIT: I realized it sounds like I don't want Yukino to be happy. I do. But if she can't save herself, the story will feel off to me. Her own club was meant to encourage people to aid people in fending for themselves. Yui was to not give up and work harder, Sagami was meant to be helped by Yukino despite how it turned out, Tobe was to ask Hina out on his own. Obviously two of these three didn't turn out entirely right, but shit happens.   I feel like 8man should help Yukino as the club would aim to help her. Even if he ends up with no one, that would be a somewhat happy ending and it would go full circle.. Sort of."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a69nb,shortofsane,3,Thu Jun 18 11:56:10 2015 UTC,"Summarized exactly how I feel, the Yukino ending would detract from a story about personal growth and understanding genuine relationships."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a69nb,Gellister,2,Thu Jun 18 13:07:11 2015 UTC,"It would only detract from the story if she's leaning on him. If he can help her help herself, it'll be fine. She's still not best girl, but it would take less away from the story."

One can't always be or always have a savior in a relationship, they have to save and be saved in exchange, give and take. Your post describes that very well.  I feel Yukino has the ability to do that, it's just that right now, she needs someone in her corner where she never had before because sometimes you can't do everything on your own even if you want to. She's growing because of 8man to learn that. Likelihood is that whenever her family woes are patched somewhat, she would go on to keep saving 8man from himself repeatedly and he would do the same for her. That's assuming their romance even goes anywhere, they all started really late and this is just what is gonna help them grow the most in the moment for whatever comes next.   Yui is too good for 8man, she's the one who has always been reaching and he has never done the same, thus in some ways she has already proven herself to be outside his grasp in many ways, even if she would be more than comfortable sitting in said grasp. She is definitely best girl but she isn't who he feels comfortable with because she is less give and take like Yukino. It's all give with maybe an occasional take. We have to respect his decisions and pick who he picks, even if it wasn't the best choice, even if it wasn't the most stable (or ""Sable"" if you will).   If it's what's most important right now, even if its a flash in a pan, if it's for everyone's betterment right now, that's what is most important because that is what is real. The future is all theoretical and the past is just memories that placed us where we are. So the only thing that is real or genuine is right now, and therefore the best choice for right here and right now is that they both help Yuki who is limping through her own life.  Everyone is allowed to have their opinions, and in my heart, I want Yui to win for the reasons you said yourself, she is the smarter choice. But is she his choice?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3a69nb,Gellister,2,Thu Jun 18 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"I've always been of the opinion that a very strong facet in equality, even if said equality isn't always in balance at any given point. One can't always be or always have a savior in a relationship, they have to save and be saved in exchange, give and take.   But how is she growing right now? I haven't caught up in the light novels (though I did finally start >_>), but it doesn't seem as if Yukino herself has taken any steps to save herself in that situation she finds herself. She's at a stand still. There is little room for personal growth within a stand still, which leads me to this   I feel Yukino has the ability to do that, it's just that right now, she needs someone in her corner where she never had before because sometimes you can't do everything on your own even if you want to.   This is an absolutely correct claim. You can't do anything on your own all of the time - there was an entire arc dedicated to this point, with 8man going to Yui and Yukino for help and confessing his desire for something genuine along the way. Romance, however, isn't something (in my opinion) that should be used for the sake of helping someone, which is why I stated that once Yukino finds a solution to her problem I'll be a little less reluctant to accept that she's won the 8bowl.  But she hasn't found a solution. We don't know how that scenario will turn out; she might help herself, she might not. Regardless, once it's gone, then romance can be considered if it isn't too late.    Yui is too good for 8man, she's the one who has always been reaching and he has never done the same...   I don't think the gap is too far, but I do agree that 8man isn't entirely deserving of Yui. With that said, I also don't think Yukino is worthy of 8man. If I were to consider anyone an equal to 8man, I'd say it's Iroha, but others would obviously disagree.   Still, that only takes me back to your opening statement:   even if said equality isn't always in balance at any given point.   As I said before, I don't believe the gap between Yui and 8man is too far, and a bridge could be built with time and effort between them. Although he might have said it arrogantly, 8man is a considerate person and his actions further serve that point. People argue that he wouldn't mesh well with Yui, but I'd beg to differ. They're both considerate, and although 8man may have a cynical/cold view of society, he does care about others, and he is good at heart. The two of them are givers in different ways.    and therefore the best choice for the right here and right now is that they both help Yuki who is limping through her own life.   Exactly. Yui and 8man should both help her help herself because they're both givers and they both can.   Everyone is allowed to have their opinions, and in my heart, I want Yui to win for the reasons you said yourself, she is the smarter choice. But is she his choice?   Probably not. She has a chance, but from the beginning I didn't think it would happen. I suppose we'll find out soon enough."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a69nb,shortofsane,2,Thu Jun 18 21:50:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your well thought points. You are probably right, Iroha is probably the most equal to 8man. :) I guess I just am trying to temper myself for the inevitable by realizing that there is some logic to the decision. People don't always pick what's best for them whether it's choosing the girl who has more problems, or choosing to rely on others but pretending not to. Our choices are what allow us to grow and sometimes it takes picking the wrong choice to help us make right choices down the line. But there is intrinsic value to making choices.   So maybe in some theoretical future after they learn from their mistakes, Hachi would somehow end up with Yui or someone like her. But right now, what's most important is that he makes his choices and isn't afraid of the consequences of getting involved. Right now he just needs to learn to trust that even through bullcrap things will be alright in the end. If that means he chooses the hard road to learn it (Yukino) so be it. At least he is making some kind of traction right?"
OreGairuSNAFU,3a69nb,shortofsane,2,Thu Jun 18 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your well thought points.   Always willing to have a friendly conversation. Beats the ""OMG YOU'RE FUCKING WRONG, YUKINO IS GOD AND YOU'RE DUMB FOR NOT BELIEVING IT"" that was occasionally given to people on this sub.   If that means he chooses the hard road to learn it (Yukino) so be  it.   This is partly why I'm hesitant. I don't think a relationship with Yukino and 8man would end up being toxic/hard. I can see 8man with Yukino, Iroha and of course Yuibae. One of the great things about the show is that you can envision him being in a romantic relationship with all three of them and come up with probable scenarios.   What I don't want is for him to enter a relationship with someone who isn't completely stable. Yukino could very well become more stable as the story reaches its end. She doesn't have to be a hard road, nor do I believe she would be.  It just goes back to my statement that I can see him ending up with any of them. I'm not against any of them, I just prefer Yui."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a69nb,Gellister,2,Thu Jun 18 23:01:25 2015 UTC,"If I were to consider anyone an equal to 8man, I'd say it's Iroha   You don't need to say more, you've solved it all.   But in all seriousness, if you allow me to join your discussion with a different point of view, the reason we're seeing Yukino as the more ""broken"" one and the one needing to be saved, it's because she was designed to be that way, it was hinted a couple of times that Yui also went through some hard times, that she wasn't always the popular girl she's now, but was she ever the focus? No, the only time we actually saw Yui was when she ""declared"" her love for Hachiman, saying she wouldn't give up, and what happens later? More Yukino.   Even though I'm with you in that I don't feel the best ending would be her, it's pretty clear that it's going to be her, either that or we get a crap top of Iroha in the next volume/chapters. But the way the story's been set, it seems like Hachiman will have to back up Yukino as she faces her family and then move on with their relationship."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a69nb,Lonaticus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"if you allow me to join your discussion   I'd never say no to that. :p   it's because she was designed to be that way   And I completely agree. She is undoubtedly more of a central character, with Yui having been there to bridge the gap between them. Now that the gap has been bridged in a way, she's kind of just awkwardly there watching as the good she's done ends up stealing what she wanted most, which, of course, I'll bitch and moan about all day once it's become official.   No, the only time we actually saw Yui was when she ""declared"" her love for Hachiman, saying she wouldn't give up, and what happens later? More Yukino.   I'm trying to put together something here, but it's relatively hard because it's true. 8man's actions involving the presidency inadvertently took away Yui's chance at the spotlight and ended up just shining it back on Yukino because she's impossible to satisfy even though it's partly her own fault because she doesn't fucking communicate that's where the story wants it to be. When 8man finally comes and says he want's something genuine, she can't even comprehend that and runs off because we're supposed to sympathize with her even though she had been nothing but a bitch to 8man for basically the entire season up to that point aside from episode one Yui was also there and reacting differently.  This is simply an argument I can't refute. While in the first season, everyone had pretty much the same amount of screen time, Zoku has been leaning heavily towards Yukino since it began. There's still a chance that it could twist and catch us off guard with a Yui or an Iroha ending, but it'd seem out of place (unless the focus is shifted to Yui and Iroha, which it won't be) given that helping Yukino has been the driving force of most of this. A certain Yukinofag I have tagged as ""Yukino Fuckboi"" uses this as his argument when he shamelessly bashes on other ships, and I can't deny that it's true. I can only use other points to strengthen my argument.   Even though I'm with you in that I don't feel the best ending would be her, it's pretty clear that it's going to be her   First thread I made on this sub stated the same thing. :p    Either that or we get a crap ton of Iroha in the next volume/chapters.   Wish we'd get Yui or her, but noap. Suffering upon both of them.   it seems like Hachiman will have to back up Yukino as she faces her family and then move on with their relationship.   Mhmm. I can't say I expect Watari to pull any sort of twists that'd change the outcome of the shipping wars. He's a fantastic writer but he doesn't seem like Ishida (Tokyo Ghoul) when it comes to the unexpected. It's been apparent from the beginning how the story would end. Which is completely fine, because the journey is what matters."

I think I remember that, but that's not really an argument as to why it has to end that way, because it shouldn't, Yukino should not be the only thing moving the show forward, she is part of it, but this is a trio and all three of them should be involved, Hachiman being the most impactful one since he's the main character.

OreGairuSNAFU,3a45yh,Y-Kun,6,Wed Jun 17 02:17:55 2015 UTC,"Let's clarify that the meaning of that sentence. Save and Help are written in the same way. In contrast to how I like you and I love you are written in a different way so Save me one day can also mean Help me one day. She didn't mean it as a princess waiting for her charming prince to save her from the dragon. More like a person who needs someone to support her which, we have to mention, is one of her personal beliefs. It's what they've been doing in the Service Club all this time.  About Iroha: Not an identity crisis. More like things didn't go as expected. She's the kind of girl who manipulates people's feelings to rest assure that she understands them. However, Hayato is most likely, the only guy she's ever met that she can't easily push around (Like Tobe) or understand their way of thinking (Like Yumiko) given that Hayato is always putting up a facade.  Hachiman's speech was basically I know I'm like a child chasing after the balloon that blew away thinking that if I keep believing that I might catch, at some point, it can actually happen. Iroha said in the next episode that Hachiman's speech moved her. She believed in such thing and spent the entire trip trying to raise her chances through appeal. It didn't work, as expected but she kept believing because of Hachiman. And while she can understand Hachiman to some exent, at the end, she can't fully deduce him. He always comes as a surprise:   ""Could it be that you're actually smart?"" He looks like a loner idiot. Instead, he persuades her and, in a way, manipulates her into following his way of thinking. When he jokingly suggests that he doesn't want people to see them leaving the school together because of possible gossip. She actually takes that seriously showing that she changed the way she sees him and somehow he still manages to surprise her.   Iroha can't understand Hachiman similar to how she can't understand Hayato. But the difference is that while Hayato is a rock that she can't break, Hachiman is a rock she's breaking slowly but there is just no end to it.  About Yui: Yes. It's a good example of fakeness. You're trying to avoid everything else and base on a single trait to ship her. If all it takes Yukino to make you ship her is to be Dere then your love for her is not genuine."

OreGairuSNAFU,3a45yh,Gellister,5,Wed Jun 17 03:01:56 2015 UTC,The irony of this is that Yui asked him to save her so he's technically just doing what she asked.

OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,LadWatcherIsHere,7,Tue Jun 16 15:44:45 2015 UTC,So basically the main focus of this series has always been Human Relationships but now we're dealing with Love Relationships and there will be a clash in here.   Yui seeks Close Friendships. Yukino seeks independence. Hachiman seeks a relationship where he can rest assure that he understands the other party.   Add love to those ideals and that's the plot for the finale of this series.
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,guyofred,4,Tue Jun 16 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much influence Watari has on these episodes. On one hand, the synopsis of 12&13 reflect the synopsis of volume 11. On the other the producers seems to be following his interpretation of the show. The cliffhanger ending of volume 10 was cut out (although they could go back it later, I guess) and so was any references to ""that time"" and the memorandums were severely abridged so it makes me think that we're going at an anime only route that loosely follows volume 11. The anime is just an advertisement for the LNs in the end."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,CrazystuffIsee,3,Tue Jun 16 16:33:37 2015 UTC,they have to in this case. There isn't enough material to call for a season 3. And as much as we can say OVA ending they might have just elected to not do that. As a result we get something like Akame ga Kill where they completely deviated from the source just so they can end the story. The manga for it still goes on but then we have some expectations and potential spoilers given how almost parallel they are with the major points.
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,YukinoYukinoshita,8,Tue Jun 16 18:19:15 2015 UTC,RIP season 3 and I think this basically confirms yui's rejection

OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,wardoctr,3,Tue Jun 16 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"realistically, Watari could end it at vol. 11. He could also end it at 12 and make some .5 volumes before or after it. If that was the case, it would still fall short since not all of it will be used in the anime, as it has been observed from previous seasons. And even if Watari had plans to make a couple more volumes, the ones responsible for the anime were already itching to end it sooner rather than later. Unless Watari finally announce the last volume for Oregairu, then there is still hope for more LN material."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,YukinoYukinoshita,2,Tue Jun 16 21:57:23 2015 UTC,"Watari did in fact mention that he is wrapping up the series now, we might get 2 or 3 more novels at most and I doubt any studio would try adapt a 12 episode series from that amount of source material. Most likely gonna be OVAS"
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,CrazystuffIsee,3,Tue Jun 16 22:28:34 2015 UTC,What makes you feel think they are willing to adapt it to the he very end. If they're going this far I'd imagine they just want it to finish. If an anime is animating the conclusion the LN is about over. If there is little left they so an original ending and let it be. Not a lot of series get a second season and not many of those get a conclusion
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,wowthatscooliguess,3,Tue Jun 16 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"Wow... I'm scared as hell after reading this.  At least they acknowledge that romance has finally become a driving force in the story. That they admit the trio knows they can ""no longer maintain the status quo"" leads me to believe a friendship ending is out of the question, because not acting out on their feelings for the sake of others goes against the whole ""genuine"" ideal. In addition, I feel like a sad ending for all would go against the entire premise of the story. Hachiman can't end up alone because he no longer wants to be alone.   Argh...

I really, really don't want to end this season with Yui's heart being crushed. Whether she confesses to 8man or she steps aside for Yukino out of love/respect for the both of them, watching her shed more tears is going to destroy me. Just the thought and I have a frog in my throat. I'm not prepared - I'll never be prepared for this.

OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Tue Jun 16 15:14:11 2015 UTC,"For me I need to stop checking it, it makes the wait more painful, especially on Thursday."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,paladinmahdi,2,Tue Jun 16 15:23:07 2015 UTC,"I know I stopped checking it, because I am trying to avoid the Waifu Wars which this subreddit is the place for not avoiding it. But this stuff right here makes it okay."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,4,Tue Jun 16 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"It's just plain fun, when you don't take it seriously, the funny thing I didn't know about these wars until season 2 aired."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,paladinmahdi,2,Tue Jun 16 15:32:54 2015 UTC,"It was fun, then I took it to seriously lol. So I stopped. But I was thinking about the last episode and I am kind of afraid to be honest. I am hoping nothing bad will happen to Yukino"
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,RalphZiggy,2,Tue Jun 16 19:03:46 2015 UTC,"Edit: Interesting picture Now I noticed it.      Oh these questions, gave me the butterfly effect somehow.   she will take a single action, but where exactly this will take the “sweet Yui” due to those feelings is something you want to see.   She will confess.    The finale will be something you can’t avoid feeling painful about, so look forward to it.   Yui will get rejected ?? They will end their friendship ?? Please not something bad with Yukino.    And once they realize they are no longer able to maintain the status quo, they will give their own idea of “something like an answer.” The climax of the story will center on how the three of them will take that step forward.   Hmmmmm so both of them will realize they can't maintain the status quo, interesting."
OreGairuSNAFU,3a0qnc,paladinmahdi,2,Tue Jun 16 11:42:17 2015 UTC,"I see this indicating Yui  putting aside her wishes, to fully support Yukino going forward with Hachiman; she'll also leave the club to let them be together, and also because it's too painful for her.  Her ""suffering will be legendary, even in hell""  That's the unhappy Yui on the cover of volume 11."

If you really want a physical copy of the OST, get one of them now. Pre-orders are almost closed.  Here's amiami for DVD.   Here's CDJapan for Blu-Ray  If you can find it cheaper somewhere else, go for it. Also take into account shipping which can increase the cost to anywhere from 10% to 80%.  P.S. Read the description of each carefully. It ships on the same date as LN Vol 11, so you can order that as well if you want to. Mind you, the LN is in Japanese."

CR subs were wrong here, she didn't say this.   The real translation is ""If that's all it takes to tear us apart, then maybe we weren't all that close to begin with."""
OreGairuSNAFU,39t0hd,paladinmahdi,2,Sun Jun 14 14:15:32 2015 UTC,Ah that makes A LOT more sense. That makes this scene even more impactful ;_;
OreGairuSNAFU,39t0hd,Taiboss,5,Sun Jun 14 14:23:34 2015 UTC,"Quick Note: She doesn't say that, it's the implied meaning. For the LN translation, Spyro used ""If that’s all it takes to destroy something, it was never meant to be anything more… Am I wrong?"", which is out of the three is the most literal translation of what she actually says.  Commie and CR used two different interpretations regarding that line. That does not mean one of them is 'wrong'. It's not a ""Right"" and ""wrong"", it's ""more implied"" and ""less implied""."
OreGairuSNAFU,39t0hd,Inori92,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"Well regardless, the meaning behind what she said is the same. As long as the meaning is conveyed I don't think it matters how the translation is.  The original by CR subs didn't convey it well enough and paladinmahdi's translation did."

OreGairuSNAFU,39s5bo,NeverEndingHope,4,Sun Jun 14 10:14:38 2015 UTC,This may be an animation error but may be also due to the fact that Iroha was rejected at the end of episode 9 by hayama so she isn't in the mood to hang out with the club.

OreGairuSNAFU,39qebo,shortofsane,0,Mon Jun 15 01:38:33 2015 UTC,"Probably gonna get a lot of down votes/salt from this, but I would appreciate an answer.  Why exactly do people find Yui to be so great? Not saying she's a bad person, but she's really generic and one-dimensional when compared to Iroha or Yukino. The two of them are so much more realistic and interesting (they're round characters with appropriately complex personalities, motivations, ambitions/goals, and flaws), yet I can't tell you how many comments I've seen saying ""Yukino is a bitch"" or ""Iroha is a slut"". Seriously, you could find Yui's ""perfect-moe"" character in plenty of other series. From what I've seen people seem to argue that ""she doesn't have any flaws or issues that contribute to conflict within the story"", but that only indicates to me that her role is to draw more attention to the other character relationships in the story and is not a subject of the author's attention for character development. Once again, I just want to emphasize that she's not a bad person and was able to keep 8man and Yukino from retreating back into their shells, but other than that she just feels like an ideal that people have put on a pedestal. I think I even saw some comments on MAL from people who didn't watch the show for anything other than the romance stating she's too good for someone like 8man (lol) and that the series sucks because it doesn't seem like he's going to end up with her.  I'm really glad to see that Iroha was able to take the number 2 spot though. Yukino unfortunately didn't have much screen time in the beginning of the season, and it doesn't seem like people made an effort to empathize and understand her character, but I guess that's just a result of the rushed adaptation. Oh well."
OreGairuSNAFU,39qebo,Justcommentingbtw,9,Sat Jun 13 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"Probably gonna get a lot of down votes/salt   Stating this will get you more downvotes than your totally unpopular opinion, which is actually the popular opinion in this sub.   generic and one-dimensional   How is she any more generic than the standard Kuudere ""Ice Queen"" and the trouble making fox archetype? How is she more one-dimensional than Yukino, who's archetype is literally being a bitch cold to everyone except the MC? I also don't see how Yukino is realistic at all. Being this stuck up just because of family problems? Never seen a person like that before. I know people who had worse familial situations than her be the nicest people I know.    ""Yukino is a bitch"" or ""Iroha is a slut""   Have you been to /a/? Literally say anything criticizing Yukino, and get swarmed by people calling Iroha/Yui sluts. The amount of Yukino shitposters is much more than the others.   ""perfect-moe""   Citation needed. Name one scene where she comes off as perfect. Most of the time 8man acts uncomfortable around her. How is that ""perfect"" at all? Wouldn't he be infatuated as he is with Yukino if she was ""perfect""? If anything, Yukino is the one who is described as ""perfect"" with 8man's monologues. Yui has flaws, namely not able to be herself. She cares too much about other peoples feelings, to basically throw away her own thoughts. If you're talking about being upbeat, energetic, and nice, that's an entirely different thing. That's just another archetype: Genki. Has there been anytime where 8man describes Yukino negatively like with Yui? No, there hasn't. And because this story is through 8man's eyes, what he sees as perfect, is perfect.   ideal that people have put on a pedestal   Taking a look at how many Yukinofags there are compared to the others, I'd say Yukino is more of the ""ideal"". Rich girl who's smart that has problems that needs the self-insert hero to save her? Pretty ideal to me, much more than Yui.  To be honest, you sound a lot like those shitposters on /a/ who were angry about this poll. It's very similar to their huge insecurity. This poll literally means nothing. It's not going to change how the story goes. Yui and Iroha have 0.05% chance of winning, so you can stop.  EDIT: MFW I realize I spent 20 minutes replying to bait."
OreGairuSNAFU,39qebo,shortofsane,5,Sun Jun 14 03:03:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look good at the moment but I'm still hopeful Yui has a better chance than 0.05%. Just hoping Watari isn't as predictable as everyone seems to think he is and he is purposely trying to mislead us. If Yui were to win in the end, did we really think it would be smooth sailing since we knew this possible jealously thing would show up eventually when Haruno foreshadowed it."
OreGairuSNAFU,39qebo,shortofsane,5,Sun Jun 14 03:54:09 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look good at the moment but I'm still hopeful Yui has a better chance than 0.05%   Not who your comment was directed to, but I'm gonna pitch in my two cents.   8man knows Yui likes/loves him. He may believe that her reasoning is misguided, but he undeniably knows it given both his reactions and his comments towards her in the LNs (not entirely caught up, but I cheated and read a few excerpts up ahead). He also hasn't flat out rejected her yet either, which I suppose we can consider a plus on the side of the Yuibros. He even went along to state that, 'someday,' the two of them will go together, even if it was he was awkward in doing such.  I suppose another point for the Yuibros is just how 8man reacts whenever she does something cutesy directed towards him. Let's just take one of his monologues from Vol. 7, for example.   The reserved grip she had on my cuff was loosened. But, she quickly grabbed my cuff once again, but this time with a lot more strength. “You need to think more of how others feel…” What followed her words was the sound of her light breathing. “…Why do you understand everything but that?” I get it. That is, if something changed, there was no going back.Whatever kind of form or shape that may have turned into, it was impossible to take back what was done. I can guarantee that. But, my blazer that Yuigahama held on to was awfully heavy. Even though she was just squeezing it with a trivial amount of strength, my shoulders felt awfully heavy. It felt like I would crumble if I were to loosen up. “That kind of stuff, I don’t like it.” She murmured with a frail, infant-like voice and gently let go of her grip on my cuff. From there, she took one step, two steps, and so on in taking her distance. Following her was impossible. For me. All I did was gaze up at the sky.   Sorry, that was really long, but it serves a point, I swear. Yui has a way of leaving 8man absolutely speechless, sometimes even internally. There are a few moments of these, but I don't really want to go digging for more. Needless to say, it makes sense from the POV of 8man. Honestly, Orimoto and Yui are hardly alike (imo), but they both fall under the 8man's category of 'nice girls.' Orimoto is an example of a nice girl 8man had once liked, proving that despite his entire rant towards them, he has been attracted to them. You could hypothesize that there were more 'nice girls' he had fallen for, but Orimoto is likely the one who fucked him up the most, as she's the only one he's named.   It could be argued that the reason 8man is left absolutely speechless around Yui (he has these moments around Yukino as well, so I'm not arguing only Yui has them) is because she's what he would have fallen for had he not sealed his heart. Naturally, he's incredibly cynical and denies that her feelings are more than just her being nice, but it isn't hard to believe that he's simply not willing to let himself be hurt yet another time by a nice girl, even if she wouldn't.   Just hoping Watari isn't as predictable as everyone seems to think he is and he is purposely trying to mislead us.   I.. Despite my attempts to reason that Yui does have a chance, I simply don't believe it. Even if I did, the way things are currently, I wouldn't want Yui and 8man to end up together. Their relationship would need much more fleshing out before it became acceptable from a literary point of view; there would need to be build up. Even if I don't want the Kuudere to win, I'd be a fool to deny that the relationship between her and 8man hasn't progressed more than his other relationships. I wouldn't want a Yuix8man ending that's spur of the moment, I'd want one that was developed appropriately. This far in, that might be impossible. :/  My preferred order of possible endings:  Yui wins the 8bowl (with proper development)  Nobody wins and they all remain best friends 5ever  Iroha wins the 8bowl  Yukino wins the 8bowl  Harem ending  But I feel like the most likely will always be that Yukino ending.  ..And holy shit, I just spent a lot of time writing this."
OreGairuSNAFU,39qebo,shortofsane,-1,Sun Jun 14 05:01:35 2015 UTC,"""To be honest, you sound a lot like those shitposters on /a/ who were angry about this poll."" ""I realize I spent 20 minutes replying to bait.""  Good job for making all those assumptions. Just want to state that I could care less about the results of these polls. I just posted my here because it was the best place to get a response. Also, just because someone disagrees with you doesn't make it bait.  ""It's very similar to their huge insecurity. This poll literally means nothing. It's not going to change how the story goes. Yui and Iroha have 0.05% chance of winning, so you can stop.""  I like that you assumed I'm insecure about Yukino's chances of winning. Besides that great ad hominem argument (stay classy), I don't really care about it at all. Hell, I would be okay if he ended up with Saika. Not to mention I also talked about Iroha. I'm just looking at the characters themselves. Jesus Christ, I don't know what you've been replying to for having this much salt.   ""Stating this will get you more downvotes than your totally unpopular opinion, which is actually the popular opinion in this sub.""  Meh, I guess you're right on that. But, my point was practically proven with the amount of salt you've just given.  ""How is she any more generic than the standard Kuudere ""Ice Queen"" and the trouble making fox archetype? How is she more one-dimensional than Yukino, who's archetype is literally being a bitch cold to everyone except the MC?""  First off, good on you for bringing up the bitch card. Really distinguishes you from the shitposters you're mentioning, you know? Second, I'm absolutely baffled by the fact that you think Iroha and Yukino still embody only their archetype. I mean, are we even watching the show?  ""Have you been to /a/? Literally say anything criticizing Yukino, and get swarmed by people calling Iroha/Yui sluts. The amount of Yukino shitposters is much more than the others.""  I actually laughed at this one. Don't victimize yourself, you guys are equally responsible for labeling Yukino as a bitch. Look at the episode discussions on r/anime for the first seven episodes, and tell me what the popular opinion was? Try going on MAL and seeing the episode discussions were like there too. A few still pop up here and there, but the majority of us ignore it like sensible people. Props to you for stooping down to their level.  ""Citation needed. Name one scene where she comes off as perfect. Most of the time 8man acts uncomfortable around her. How is that ""perfect"" at all?""  That wasn't at all what I meant when I said she was ""perfect"". I literally mentioned right after that sentence that people came to that conclusion because ""she doesn't have any flaws or issues that contribute to conflict within the story"", and was that perfectly nice girl to you. That's pretty much the synopsis of what I've seen so far. You didn't even bother answering why you liked Yui to begin with, which was infact, my original question.   ""I also don't see how Yukino is realistic at all. Being this stuck up just because of family problems? Never seen a person like that before. I know people who had worse familial situations than her be the nicest people I know.""  I also know somebody who has horrible family circumstances yet is still a great person. What's your point? You also conveniently didn't mention that she became a recluse because of being bullied by her fellow peers. Just because something hasn't specifically pertained to you doesn't make it impossible. People react differently to problems. Either way you took what I said out of context. I clearly wrote, ""they're round characters with appropriately complex personalities, motivations, ambitions/goals, and flaws"", something that Yui obviously lacks. When has Yui gone through any real character development?  ""Namely not able to be herself. She cares too much about other peoples feelings, to basically throw away her own thoughts""  Please, do elaborate.   ""I'd say Yukino is more of the ""ideal"". Rich girl who's smart that has problems that needs the self-insert hero to save her? Pretty ideal to me, much more than Yui.""  More ideal than the submissive, cute, self-worth generation machine who will never talk back or question you? Unlikely. Either way, I've already established that's not the reason I found her interesting.  ""Wouldn't he be infatuated as he is with Yukino if she was ""perfect""?"" ""Has there been anytime where 8man describes Yukino negatively like with Yui? No, there hasn't. And because this story is through 8man's eyes, what he sees as perfect, is perfect.""  Congratulations, you missed the entire premise of the series. The whole conflict was around Yukino and 8man discovering they weren't as similar as they thought they were. Both Yukino and 8man held each other on pedestals at the beginning of the story, but ended up having to face reality. Hence the reason they had a falling out in the first season, and also why Yukino was so conflicted in the beginning of this season.  Man, I didn't know people got this worked about stuff like this."

Cute: That become a plot point for the ""I hate nice girls"" speech and why 8man rejects her advances.  Self-worth generation machine: I have no idea what you mean by that. Being upbeat/happy? Well, that's how she deals with things. Just like Yukino deals with things by putting them below her/ignoring them.   Please, do elaborate.   That was explained in the first few volumes/episodes. She wants to keep her friends/groups happy, so she never gets to share her thoughts.   bullied by her fellow peers.   Citation needed. She's a goddess to her class, don't know what you're talking about.   When has Yui gone through any real character development?   Hmm, let's see: ""I hate nice girls"", where she had to reconcile with the group. ""I'll beat Yukino"", where she finally wanted something for herself. ""Genuine"" scene, which was basically growth for everyone. And let's not forget when every time 8man and Yukino had a conflict, she was their to bridge the gap.   ""she doesn't have any flaws or issues that contribute to conflict within the story"", and was that perfectly nice girl to you.   Already said ""too nice"".   why you liked Yui   Because I like people who work hard for their goals. I also like to see hard work rewarded. Being upbeat and happy is a nice touch as well. Also works nice into the theme of 8man getting his old life back.   Don't victimize yourself, you guys are equally responsible for labeling Yukino as a bitch.

I'm absolutely baffled by the fact that you think Iroha and Yukino still embody only their archetype.   Want me to break it down even more? Yukino is a worse Senjougahara, considering Yukino almost never shows her dere side, and Hitagi had a much worse problem. Iroha isn't used as much, but the ""mischievous female"" character is pretty prevalent. Yui is an archetype too, the genki. This series isn't that different from the others. It just has better characters than most.   amount of salt you've just given.   Let me quote you: ""I would appreciate an answer."" And so I answered.   Besides that great ad hominem argument (stay classy)   Ad Hominem: An attack on the person instead of the argument. I'm pretty sure I didn't attack you, only associated you. It would be a fallacy if I compared you to them, and then said your statement is invalid. But I didn't. It can't be helped that is sounds very similar to them. Attacking another character for reasons that are explained?   Jesus Christ, I don't know what you've been replying to for having this much salt.   You wanted an answer, I gave you one.

She might be a goddess to her class now, but very early on, I think even the first time she and 8man ever actually met, she referenced how she had trouble during elementary/middle school because she was so much more beautiful/perfect than her peers. Even then, characters Miura, who are described as more socially popular, still treat her with a superiority complex. I suppose that could be considered bullying also.   Want me to break it down even more? Yukino is a worse Senjougahara, considering Yukino almost never shows her dere side, and Hitagi had a much worse problem.

Honestly, it's actually quite disappointing. She's becoming reliant/chasing after 8man, and I think that's all the more reason they shouldn't be together. Yukino's now holding him on a pedestal.   One could try to argue Yui is holding him on a pedestal, but Yui hasn't asked for him to 'save her someday.' She stands strong on her own as of yet.   Hmm, let's see: ""I hate nice girls"", where she had to reconcile with the group. ""I'll beat Yukino"", where she finally wanted something for herself. ""Genuine"" scene, which was basically growth for everyone. And let's not forget when every time 8man and Yukino had a conflict, she was their to bridge the gap.   I do want to reinforce this, and also add that she's become less afraid to speak her mind since the beginning of the series. Think back to her first conflict with Miura in that case. That was a big step for her, and she's only come farther and farther since then."

Guess you learn something every day.   Have you read the LNs? Because 8man had never described Yukino in a negative view. Never. If that isn't idealism, I don't know what is.   You know that 8man tends to push blame onto himself rather than others right? He takes more than he should, and sadly he's fine with it. That's why he was okay with the social suicide approach. So, in his conflicts with Yukino, he felt he was in the wrong. Also, you typically analyze characters from an outside view, so I'm not sure why you're referencing 8man's point of view to begin with. How is that idealism?   Submissive: Don't really know where you got that from. I don't remember any scenes where she gets pushed around. In fact, she's more proactive than the others.

Self-Worth generation machine: It's exactly what it says. She never comes into any conflict with the MC, and perfectly content with serving and praising him.

It either refers to characterizing someone further by attributing traits and depth to them and their background or having them be dynamic throughout the story. Yui has remained almost entirely the same since the beginning of the series and was never that complex. Therefore, the only example you brought up that actually worked was that she wanted to ""beat Yukino"". Even that was pretty minor.   Already said ""too nice"".   What?   Because I like people who work hard for their goals. I also like to see hard work rewarded. Being upbeat and happy is a nice touch as well. Also works nice into the theme of 8man getting his old life back.   ""Hard work"". Sure she helped with getting 8man and Yukino from retreating into their shells, but ""hard work""? Ok then, whatever you say man. I also established that I don't think 8man actually wants to get his old life back, hence the reason he was so shocked to see Orimoto and why he has buried it in his memories. He simply is learning to adjust back to society.   And compare it to the number of people shitting on Iroha and Yui. Yep, that's right, a lot more.  Uh, are we reading the same threads?

The LN has a ton of references to other anime and Chiba culture. Watari really likes his memes.

I think series that have fewer fantastical elements - real world settings, slice of life, etc. - have less of a chance of being brought over because of the difficulty of dealing with cultural references and jokes vs. the expected return on investment.  Kizumonogatari is finally getting an official release over here, and the publisher has pretty much said not to expect any more because they don't think they can make it profitable to commit to doing so.  Considering that Nisioisin's Zaregoto series was abandoned after two novels, and the failure of the Faust journals, they're probably justified in their pessimism.  But that was years ago and the market has changed drastically in that time.  I think they might find a more dependable market this time, if they tried again."

They weren't even eligible for the election at that point.  Showing them that he basically had the election locked meant there was nothing they could do even if they were determined to run. He didn't fully understand Yukino's motivations in running, so his actions were based on a faulty assumption.  In the end he did more harm than good as a consequence.  This line needs a lot of unpacking, but it applies to a lot of people, himself included.  They all keep looking to somebody else as a justification for acting on their own desires, and as a result they don't let their friends know what they really want. That wishful thinking is futile and simply an exercise in ego-massage.  ""If I could restore to last save, I would have made the correct choice.""  It's bullshit, is what he's saying.

He saw Haruno goad her into doing it, but after all of that he starts to wonder if maybe she was doing the same thing he was doing - waiting for someone else to give her an excuse to do something.  That maybe, the idea of being president was something she actually did desire.  Because they'd fallen into a pattern of interaction where they attempted to interpret and analyze everything they said to each other, at that point, they missed the obvious (yet dangerous) solution of speaking frankly to each other.  Not unjustifiably - they're both prickly people and Yukino's rebuffed attempts at intimacy from both 8man and Yui up to that point, so the fault goes both ways there.  Nevertheless, lack of communication and trust in each other as people (rather than pedestalized ideals) was a direct cause of their conflict."
OreGairuSNAFU,39pms9,randomdudeman12,10,Sat Jun 13 15:04:09 2015 UTC,"we also learn from this chapter   Dunno.  That's Haruno talking.  I'm not sure she's trustworthy at this point.  She may have insight into Yukino's character, but her understanding of a younger Yukino might be blinding her from any real developments on her part.  She might also not be acting in her best interest anymore either.  I get the impression that what she's insinuating is that Yukino always has been and always will be a codependent personality - somebody who has a pathological need to have somebody in their life to lean on.  Somebody who can't survive on their own.  Does that really sound like Yukino?  Or is Haruno reading the worst possible interpretation of Yukino's mistakes up to this point to support a foregone conclusion on her end?  There's so much we don't know in their background yet that we can only speculate one way or the other until we learn more.  But I don't think its impossible that the bitterness and resentment between the Yukinoshita sisters doesn't just go one way.  I think its within the realm of possibility that Haruno would attempt to sabotage Yukino's efforts at building a life for herself outside of the sphere of the Yukinoshita family out of spite and envy.  She's not exactly doing so great in terms of having her own personal life, it seems - given how much time she has to hang around with high schoolers.  Relying on other people is normal, after all.  We only have to look as far as poor Sensei to see what happens when somebody is too independent.  That's not just a possible ending for 8man - in fact, given current demographic realities in Japan, it's just as likely that a beautiful, talented girl like Yukino would end up 30 years old and unmarriageable if she doesn't start building a home in somebody else's heart soon.   No Longer Human connections   They're there, of course - otherwise the author wouldn't have used anonymous characters thinking about the book as a framing device in Volume 10 - but it's less useful to look for character and plot parallels than it is to think about how any given reader relates to the text.  No Longer Human is famously a kind of litmus test for the reader - where are you at in life when you read this?  This book will ""speak"" to you differently at different points in your life.  You can find the character to be painfully relatable.  You can look at him with scorn and disgust.  These are both valid readings because the novel is a mirror held up to the soul of the reader.  Somebody who is lost, disillusioned, cynical, may find that the MC's mania reflects a lot of their own turmoil.  Somebody who has passed through the uncertainty and struggle of young adulthood to begin building a life for themselves can look back on him (and on their past selves) with pity, or contempt.  All of this is to say that looking at No Longer Human as a kind of guide to reading upcoming character developments is a little bit misguided on the part of the anon in that thread, because the interludes already show the process of reflection and self-evaluation that really matters.  I could find as many examples in that text that show 8man isn't similar to MC (Yozou Oba, but his name is never given in the English translation of the novel).  For one thing, the MC in No Longer Human never was human to begin with.  He was a sociopath from his earliest childhood.  We know 8man didn't become what he is until adolescence, after years of making a genuine effort and being crapped on for it.  Interestingly, a possible alternative translation for the title of 人間失格 is ""Disqualified as a Human Being,"" which more aptly describes his experience.  With that said, I also thought that 8man's fear of finishing the book was a pretty ominous ending.  Through cultural osmosis he probably would have a sense of the ending already, but given that all I said earlier about No Longer Human being a litmus test isn't bullshit, it does reflect on his own tenuous development.  Does this imply that he's capable of backsliding?  His commitment to changing for the sake of finding his something genuine, so far, seems to be pretty sincere.  I wonder if we're meant to read that as a hint that he's still on pretty shaky ground, that there still is a danger of him falling back into petty, self-satisfied cynicism.  Time will tell."

Yukino after all is a ""substitute"" in the Yokinoshita family, an afterthought.  Thinking in terms of Japanese (and many other asian) culture I'm sure the parents wished she was a son.  She'll eventually be used as pawn to further family interests, probably involving arranged marriage (though I hope that particular thing is NOT a plot device in future episodes, too campy)."

I'd like to think Haruno is trying to be a good sister in her own way, encouraging what she sees as a good match for her sister (8man) without allowing her to simply ""co-opt"" him into the drama of her life."
OreGairuSNAFU,39pms9,socalso,2,Sat Jun 13 21:54:53 2015 UTC,"Volume six strongly hints that Haruno plays the villain so Yukino can grow. As for the aggressive tone she uses when teasing, I believe it is because of their sibling rivalry. My siblings and I have had similar interactions. I also believe Haruno wants Yukino to surpass her. It seems to me that she hates all the responsibilities that have been imposed on her and would gladly step aside for Yukino.   Source: Me. No seriously. Being an elder brother sucks."
OreGairuSNAFU,39pms9,txchr15,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:48:13 2015 UTC,"That's why I still mostly think she's trying to look out for Yukino, that moment from volume 6.  8man deduced that she was doing exactly what he was was doing.  If there's any reason to doubt it, it's because Haruno didn't actually cop to it when 8man made the connection.  She may have simply allowed him to believe what he wanted about her.  I tend to think she wouldn't do that, though; she goes out of her way to try to talk to 8man as though he were on her level.  She teases, but she's not condescending as she is when dealing with Hayama and Yukino.  In spite of what she told him about hating guys who are so perceptive, I think she actually does want him to see her for what she is - and Yukino, and Hayama - and make his choices accordingly."
OreGairuSNAFU,39pms9,socalso,2,Sat Jun 13 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"Odd observation. That first paragraph on the comparison sounds like Yukino to me. When the memorandums appeared, people assumed they were either Hachiman's, Hayato's or Haruno's. I wonder if they would fit Yukino? Gotta reread that volume.    The problem with Yukino clinging is that she recognized herself that she needs something to have her place instead of being a ""filler"" (vol 9). I theorize that after following her sister steps, she's going to try and follow Hachiman's (perhaps try to outdo him?), as he showed that he's capable of growth. Of course, that isn't trust nor love, and It's obviously avoiding the problem. That said, I suck at putting my thoughts in order, so spare me if I wrote something senseless. EDIT: forgot to mention this... Those last lines at the infirmary sounded like ""I'm gonna change classes so we can be together""."

Ending up like Sensei is a possible worst-case scenario for any of them.  If what they've got really is ""genuine"" (I suppose they're figuring that out for themselves right now), surely modifying their plans to give that a chance to develop isn't unreasonable.  Speaking as somebody who works in education, there's almost no qualitative difference in the long run between one degree program and another.  Your B.A. in English will be just as useless coming from UCLA as it would be from Waseda University.  And a Science or Math degree is only as useful as the mind behind it, and the will to build a career off of that particular skill set.  So whether Yukino wins a seat at a prestigious Japanese university or transfers into a mid-tier foreign university (Ivy Leagues in America notoriously discriminate against Asian applicants, so her odds are slim even with her intellect), she would probably be able to do something with her degree."

It has as much to do with the cult of personality a given world-traveler cultivates than anything to do with their actual educational experiences abroad.  I can't pretend my anecdotal experience is anything other than anecdotal, but given that, I knew a bunch of 30-something Japanese women who were pretty much looking at the end of their party years with nothing to look forward to beyond it but jobs they hated and friends that wouldn't allow them to make meaningful changes for the better.  How much of that has to do with bad choices?  I can only speculate, but I would guess quite a bit.

I already didn't like how they chose to not end an episode with the end of volume 9. Moving Haruno's talk to the start of the episode really reduces the impact of the ominous ending it gave off when we first read it. It's not even a questionable choice, it would be straight up bad (similar to a certain HBO series)."
OreGairuSNAFU,39pms9,CrazystuffIsee,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:57:52 2015 UTC,I can't blame them though if they pulled it off like this. It gives something for the beginning of the episode. In the case of using it with the beginning of the episode it gives off the feeling throughout the episode rather than leaving people questioning for a week. They both accomplish the goal of the scene. So it doesn't have to be with the ending of the recent episode as long as it's still portrayed and used correctly.   Also consider how rushed volume 10 was squeezed through. They cut out a chunk of stuff. They even pushed presenting Yumiko the results of Hayama's career path till the very end. I think given the constraint of finishing most volume 10 in one episode they are able to do the scene properly.

Hayama playfully calls him ""Hikitani,"" though he knows it isn't 8man's real name—a sort of verbal foreplay (quite shameless, tbqh). We've been on the Hayama route all along. For further evidence, just review my comment history; I've been pushing the HayaHiki agenda on this subreddit for months now.  Before the ship wars start, yes, it's HayaHiki not HikiHaya.

We saw far less Hayato in the anime, and the only part that could surely lead to ""the man who satisfies those around them"" is the episode title, and his talk with 8man (which is the conclusion).   However, as the story goes, 8man was supposed to be the one that figured out this side of Hayato and executed this strategy based on that. In other words, there should be enough points for us to see that Hayato is this type of guy, before the marathon started.

About Miura, it seems that Miura has always been the girl that has the closest relationship with Hayato since the beginning of time, and it just naturally becomes something normal I believe.

Hachiman suggested Hayama to choose sciences since most girls tend to choose liberal arts and by doing so he can avoid most of them but Hayama states that he has to choose Liberal arts since he needs to continue to be with them to meet their expectations. Judging by this the main trio and Hayama's group is going to end up in the same Uni/college hopefully this becomes a longer LN series or at least get a sequel, so we can see their Uni life or even their life as adults."
OreGairuSNAFU,39nxh7,socalso,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:53:34 2015 UTC,"The point is that whatever it was, he didn't have a choice in the matter.  The implication is that his parents chose for him, and he's too obedient to defy their will.  But for what it's worth, 8man was able to deduce that his choice was probably Humanities.  Since he was bound to take up one of the family practices - law or medicine - we can infer that he's being groomed to join and eventually take up his father's law practice."
OreGairuSNAFU,39nxh7,manamono,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Spoiler. That's why he needed to execute that plan during the marathon."
OreGairuSNAFU,39nxh7,socalso,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:13:37 2015 UTC,"That's right.  That's where he made his deduction.  The whole ""choose Science because..."" attack helped him figure it out - he based his deduction on the way Hayama responded to that."
OreGairuSNAFU,39nxh7,manamono,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:17:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's interesting. I was in an impression that 8man's answer was based on Hayato's denial of 2 choices answer.  (from LN) “That’s why I won’t do as you say.” “I see.” I nodded and Hayama returned one as well.  He clearly seems to get his answer from this ""I won't do as you say"" phrase, which basically saying ""NOT SCIENCE!"" (He even nodded there!). This will also make sense to the fact that Feel left out the information about his family. If it wasn't from this phrase, there would be no way that 8man could reach this conclusion in an anime."
OreGairuSNAFU,39nxh7,socalso,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:40:45 2015 UTC,Yes.  That's what I meant.  We're on the same page.  He based his deduction off of Hayama's response to that.

OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,razor150,7,Fri Jun 12 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"With the LN as the source things don't look so rosey for her yet. I admit to being a fan of Yui but I do believe Yukino ends up being the one. It just depends on how far Watari wants or feels Yukino and Hachiman would grow. Them being together means the least amount of growth for both of them, imo."
OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,nathanoi,5,Sat Jun 13 23:37:05 2015 UTC,"man you know the infirmary scene? yui was actually sad cause she saw yukino being intimate with 8man, not 8man with yukino /s  i actually kinda hope that he just friends in the end. if you can say ""i love you because i need you"" its not healthy, whereas ""i need you because i love you"" is. yukino might just be under the ""this guy saved me hes hot"" effect which i forgot the name of. yui actually kinda is too with him saving her dog. but IROHA (no im kidding i have bias) (ok wow all of them are under 8man's therapeutic i will help you effect cause he helped with the christmas event) (but hey if 8man was helping iroha while she was into hayama then any and all iroha advances after getting windmill slammed on are kinda real) (unless iroha is into making men take responsibility) (which she is)"
OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,razor150,6,Sat Jun 13 23:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Yui has had misunderstandings before. This one is a lot more decisive then the last one, this isn't exactly ""I saw them out together so they must be dating"" type of misunderstanding again. I am curious about what it drives her to do, will she cheer Yukinon on, or will she finally be willing to fully confess her own feelings?  Hachiman getting with Iroha, would be like him deciding that putting up a fake front is the way to be. Though her wanting something genuine as well is likely why he is the only person that gets to see the real her. I am sure there is a lot of growing left for her to go through, maybe she will be the next Spoiler (Haganai spoiler). I do love their interactions though, they are almost always hilarious.  My opinion though, if Watari thinks Hachiman can grow enough as a person Yui is the best girl for him. He would have to get over so many issues to be able to really be with her. She is the whole reason he and Yukino actually began to change. Hopefully her ending, whatever it may be, is satisfying."

OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,guyofred,12,Tue Jun 16 13:07:08 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck they rushed the shit out of it. They covered a lot of material but they barely spent any time on anything so it loses a lot of its meaning. Going from the page by page adaptation of volume 9 to this was jarring. A lot of time was spent on the infirmary scene which I appreciated but is unfortunately going to spawn more waifu war shit. They cut out any references to ""that time"" between Hayama and Yukino, too so probably no S3."
OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,socalso,10,Fri Jun 12 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely rushed.  This is the first time I felt like the condensed plotting was truly detrimental to the adaptation.  I didn't mind what was done up to this point, for the most part.  I feel two episodes would have been appropriate to do justice to this mini-arc.  So if they're chopping that down to one (plus half of 10 and possibly a couple minutes of 12, I guess), I'm hoping they've got a good reason for doing so.  Like, say, that they wanted to animate some of the .5s - the Christmas party, where 8man gives Christmas gifts to the girls, or Iroha's date, or the free newspaper.  There's some good content in there, and its not like the last season didn't end with a .5 either.  The rumor that they're animating at least part of Volume 11 as a cliffhanger ending for the season is probably pretty unlikely, but I could understand them chopping so much of Volume 10 if that's the plan."
OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,manamono,3,Fri Jun 12 05:14:06 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of uneasy feelings and curiosity when reading this in the LN (even the 2nd time). I'm very disappointed I couldn't find anything of that sort here. There's no saying about the importance of career path and shit. It's barely noticeable that Miura was wondering about Hayato's career path until 8man said it himself in the monologue. We also lost the connection between 8man and Yumiko and the reason that makes him want to help her. They show nothing about an uneasy feelings 8man has. There's no Tobe's reference to the ""Y"" Hayato mentioned before during the summer camp. Haruno comes out of nowhere. The marathon comes out of nowhere. The conversations are also super rush. Everyone's Hayato? the man of expectation? We see nothing about 8man's train of thought until he could come out with the solution during the marathon. It's definitely jumping places to places as you said. I like the infirmary scene, but I don't think it's worth sacrificing all these amazing subtext to this at all.  This is really the worst adapted episode so far in Oregairu this season. They could have stop this episode midway during the marathon before 8man talks to hayato, and take the time to demonstrate the problem lingering there. I don't know if there could be any good enough reason to do this at all."

I honestly get the feeling that Iroha and Yukino are quite fond of each other in the LNs, and that there's a bit more of Komachi in Iroha, than Yui ( potential rival )."
OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,socalso,2,Fri Jun 12 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"That's not the impression I get.  She always seems kind of irritated that she's around, especially from Volume 9 onwards when she starts hanging all over 8man slyly.  I wouldn't say that indicates dislike, because Yui often gets the same from Yukino, but at this point we know there's love behind that.  For Iroha?  I think Yukino's still trying to get over all the crap she them through and the continued complications she brings into the Service Club's dynamic."
OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,iskow,3,Fri Jun 12 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"Oh she gets annoyed for sure. It's just that all the things she did in vol 9 for Iroha, plus her interactions with her in 10, and specially 10.5 just give me that vibe. But yeah, I can see where you're coming from."
OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,guyofred,8,Fri Jun 12 06:18:41 2015 UTC,"Dumping my rambling here because I spent way too much time on this and I want to fucking sleep    It's time to choose career paths so  it's going to be talked about a lot. Career paths determine what classes you're getting for the next year and sets you up for college. There's humanities/liberal arts and sciences to choose from and the latter is obviously much more difficult. Depending on what they choose they could be separated from their friends the next year which is something Hayana's cliques probably doesn't want. However changing your future's path just to stay with friends isn't smart and Hayama knows this and holds it back which surprises them. The conversation then transitions into the rumor. The rumor floating about saying that Yukino and Hayato are dating. This clearly irritates Hayama and he must've been really pissed to drop his ""nice guy"" facade in front of his friends for the first time. Dammit virgin Oooka (or was it Yamato who never got any pootang?) Hayama wasn't the only who's pissed, Miura is, too. How dare someone steal her husbando! There's also someone else who's bothered by the rumor.  The clubroom is celebrating Yukino's birthday and Isshiki's also there for some odd reason. Both Hachiman and Yui know of the rumor but kept silent but this dumb bitch just blurts it out. With Hayama snapping there's no way to know how Yukino would react. For now she lets Isshiki live. Even if she hadn't told her the rumor would have eventually reached Yukino's ears anyways with her and Hayama being the two most popular kids at school a rumor of them together was inevitably going to blow up. Not only that it's also the first rumor involving Hayama. While Yukino can just ignore it Hayama can't. Dumbfucks keep asking him out to the point where it's more a pain than anything. Even without that having people talk about them behind their backs is unnerving and rather bothersome. For some reason people really like digging into other people's lives.  Miura then enters the room (without knocking!) and Isshiki leaves (without boxes!). It's a clash between two queens. They never got physical in the anime but whatever. Miura also asks the same question to Yukino. In the end she just wants to know Hayama's career path. Their relationship has been strained for a while now and them breaking apart was inevitable. Facing the career path is looking straight into that inevitability.  Yukino giving Hachiman MAX Coffee, I see. Truly based. It's only obvious that Hachiman asks Hayama. Yukinoshita is also part of the rumor so someone seeing them together will only propel it even further. Yui is one the same level as Tobe and Hayama didn't tell him. If it can't be someone close to him it has to be someone furthest away: Hachiman, Hayama's antithesis. But even then Hayama doesn't tell him. It'll defeat the purpose of keeping it to himself, after all. Deciding your future just because of someone else you're going to regret it. Especially if it's for someone you don't truly know, just someone's caricature. Hayama hates people gossiping and digging into his life and Hachiman is doing just that or promoting it by asking. I feel as though the anime missed the broader point of this scene. This scene reveals how he seems to be used to these kinds of things. Having rumors about him float around and getting in the way of life and Yukino's too.  Damn, they cut out tsundere Zaimokusa. He always gets cut out :( Such is life of chuuni. Just as Hachiman's illusion of people gets shattered, he views Zaimokusa in a different way. While most people go with subjects they're familiar with Zaimokusa went with the sciences because it was uncomfortable. If you don't face your fears you won't learn, he says. Of course that doesn't apply to girls which the sciences have fewer of. Quality > quantity I suppose.  Just as Hachiman's illusion of people gets shattered, he views Totsuka in a different way. He only saw Totsuka as a cute face and nothing really beyond that. He never really cared to know about Saika Totsuka. The hardworking club president people look up to, the person who looks up to Hachiman. Totsuka legitimately wanted to be friends with Hachiman. Sure they talk to each other often but that's not really friendship. Hachiman never really opened up to him and never hinted that he was going to. While they still never did, it's a step in the right direction. Just by being nice to each other all the time their shallow friendship would have withered away. Gradually, little by little they'd be able to truly face each other.  They also cut out Hachiman's talk with Hiratsuka. They talk about the future and how easily it can be changed. Even if you decide to do sciences you can always switch to liberal arts and vise versa. Even past that you can transfer colleges and change careers further along the road. Choosing liberal arts/sciences doesn't set your future in stone, it's just one of many opportunities presented in life. So why is Hayama keeping it a secret? They also talk about the International Liberal Studies for people who want to travel beyond Nipponland and how Hachiman can be a good teacher (lmao) if he really tried.  Hachiman's talk with Ebina was omitted, as well. She talks about how everyone trusts Hayama and he always lives up to people's expectations. Even if Hayama's path was leaked nothing would change because Hayama would find a way to sweep it under the rug and Miura would follow so their clique won't break apart. So once again, why is Hayama hiding his career path?  And so appears Haruno. The woman with a fifty foot thick facade. Haruno-lite (Isshiki) sucks up to her but Haruno saw right through that shit. Also Meguri was there. Was. Was until she got FEEL'd (wait that doesn't sound right). The main point of this scene is the interactions with Yukino and Haruno. Yukino should have had an idea of what Hayama's career path would have been but being dependent on others makes you weak and makes you unable to do things on your own. Yukino just like Hachiman always figured out problems on her own but now that's there's Hachiman and others to rely on that part of her went numb. But that's not necessarily a bad thing but it is in Haruno's eyes. Haruno also asks Yukino about her career path but she doesn't say so she asks Hachiman to ask for her. The dumb bitch Isshiki also let the rumor slip to Haruno who just says ""that's something they've been through since a long time ago.""  And now we're at the marathon. In a sea of people it'll be difficult to face Hayama face to face so he asks Totsuka and has his tennis club hold up everyone else temporarily. Hayama has good grades so he could easily go either way. His father is a lawyer and his grandfather is a doctor. When deciding which path to choose people throw away subjects they dislike and things they don't want to do. To Hayama other people are a pain. Always having to live up to expectations of other people and never getting a chance to be himself so by choosing sciences he'd throw away his relationships and thus most of his expectations. Hayama is impressed by his warped way of thinking but that't also why he hates him. What does Hayama lose to with Hachiman? His ability to solve problems even if it's in a twisted, underhanded way. Hayama mentioned trying to save something but losing it but Hachiman was able to save things. Even now he solved the problem. Deep down in Hayama it doesn't matter what he chooses but by chooses sciences he'll lose to Hachiman. Hayama then proceeds to win the marathon for the second year in the row while Hachiman falls on his face. I can relate :( feelsbadman.png  Hayama quickly kills the rumor while Hachiman limps away. Ah yes, the infirmary scene. So she tells Hachiman her career path but not Haruno. No episode would be complete without Yui suffering. Hayama apologizes to Yukinoshita face to face rather than through Hachiman like he originally intended. They cut out any references to that time but it doesn't even matter if the anime isn't even going to cover that. Yukinoshita also says that they shouldn't let the past tie them down to Hayama but also to Hachiman indirectly. If she's not following Haruno's shadow whose is she following or is she even following anyone's? Hayama says that's all there is to it so it probably means Yukino still hadn't changed at her core. Yukinoshita followed Haruno's shadow because she wanted to be like her and looked up to her. I'm guessing she's now following Hachiman's shadow for the same reason meaning she still didn't change much deep inside. Of course Hachiman doesn't know this. Hayama knew all along it doesn't matter what he chooses and the group will stay together but he kept his mouth shut because his path wasn't his choice. While he told people they'll regret choosing their path because of him he's the one who truly regretted it. Hayama could only cling on to the best solution to continue to answer people's expectations. Those people who don't understand that only keeps him down. Hayama, just like Hachiman, doesn't want people to be hurt so that's why even then he continues to live up to people's expectations. That's why he doesn't choose and that doesn't sit right with Hachiman. Because that's just self satisfaction. Only when someone calls Hayama out on his insincere answers can he answer honestly.  They never really focused on a single scene so the fragmented scenes lose some of its meaning so I tried to fill that in. What they skipped that bothers me the most is Hachiman's reaction to the rumors. Someone who stays willfully apathetic about other people and things that don't concern him was bothered by the rumor. It speaks a lot about his character and his thoughts on Yukino. Maybe he was just angry at people spouting shit they know nothing about but even then he's bothered by it."

OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,TheNewbieOne,5,Fri Jun 12 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"Could someone that read the LN clarify something for me?   At the end of this episode, Hayato said that Yukinon had changed in a way that she stopped follow Haruno's shadow and told hachiman if he noticed. Hachiman responded that he did not notice the change in Yukinon.   What exactly is Hayato referring?  From my inference, I think Yukinon looks up to Hachiman? Yukinon wants to follow Hachiman's shadow because he is different from the rest of the group. Hachiman uses logic and reasoning like how she would to solve group problems while preserving their friendship. This causes Hachiman's image as impressive in Yukinon's view? Am I wrong?"
OreGairuSNAFU,39iyft,CrazystuffIsee,6,Fri Jun 12 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell for me but I think it's the cold attitude she would have towards him.

Also Yukino mentioned that Hayama's choice might affect her, since the two families had two major businesses that needed both backgrounds.  That if Haruno chose one course of studies, the logical thing would be for Yukino to choose the other.    But now the family senses Yukino is thinking ""screw that mindset, not following Haruno any more, not doing what family expectations are and going on my own path"""

OreGairuSNAFU,39ieoa,CrazystuffIsee,7,Thu Jun 11 23:16:10 2015 UTC,She's dumb to the school standards but not dumb overall. Just to emphasize that part. Considering how Komachi is fearing she won't make it into the school.  I only see her being cynical to Yukino and maybe 8man. 2 friends she cares about now have a romantic interest in one another. It goes against what she wants and what she's tried to maintain.
OreGairuSNAFU,39ieoa,FrozenFyre,4,Thu Jun 11 23:34:02 2015 UTC,No Yui's actually pretty dumb overall in my opinion. Although if you haven't read the light novel then you probably wouldn't think that since the anime cut out a lot of jokes making fun of her. Not to say I hate her or anything though. I still think she's super cute.
OreGairuSNAFU,39ieoa,CrazystuffIsee,6,Fri Jun 12 03:27:01 2015 UTC,Making fun of her doesn't have to equate to how dumb she is. I mean I can make fun of you for basing your idea off of another perspective rather than the environment. Yet you're probably smarter than I am in other things. Get where I am trying to point at? I think I rambled it so I can keep it short but the gist is this.
OreGairuSNAFU,39ieoa,FrozenFyre,5,Fri Jun 12 03:34:47 2015 UTC,hm I guess making fun of her was poor wording on my part. Theres actual scenes in the light novel where she's portrayed as quite dumb.  She does hang out with 2 of the smartest people in the school though so that might make it hard to gauge her compared to how other students are in the school.
OreGairuSNAFU,39ieoa,CrazystuffIsee,2,Fri Jun 12 03:54:29 2015 UTC,"your second paragraph is likely why we see her as dumber than the cast of characters but we can't say she is dumb otherwise she wouldn't be there in the first place. The only things we can link to with the school, is through Komachi and how Kaori's conversation with 8man (I can try to find it but for now I'm looking at this off of memory). Because it seems implied enough to say it's one of those top schools."
OreGairuSNAFU,39ieoa,FrozenFyre,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:28:22 2015 UTC,I think their school is a pretty goos public college prep school but it was one of the easier ones to get into(?). Can't remember 100% off the top of my head and I'm too lazy to check.  Arguably we don't know how strong Komachi is in acadmeics either but thats argueing for the sake of argueing. Maybe its because I've watched too many anime where the really dumb students can get one good score for a test through extensive studying/a fluke that I can see Yui being there despite being dumb.   Talking with you has made me reconsider how smart she is though so thanks for that haha.
OreGairuSNAFU,39ieoa,RalphZiggy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:09:17 2015 UTC,"More accurate to say she's supposed to be like ordinary 16 year old teenage girl, in the LN she's confused by words of business, politics, and world that most adults would know (that Hachiman and Yukino use) but very much instead into pop culture (kind of excluding ""otoku"" type interests though like anime or light novels, etc. which Hikki does know a bit).   And she doesn't like to study like Yukino and Hachiman do, which again is not ""dumb""  but just typical and normal."

A badly executed ending wouldn't necessarily nullify that.  I think if he didn't have a clear idea of the ending in mind, it would have been a more meandering kind of story.  The fact that he thought far enough ahead for each volume to correspond to roughly one month in a single year shows some foresight there.  I don't believe he'll arbitrarily drop the ball because he lost the thread of his story, if that reflects on the kind of planning he's done.  With that said, there's a difference between a troll ending and an inconclusive ending.  As you said, they're second year high school students going onto third year.  The series is apparently said to be ending soon, so we won't see much, if any, of that third year or beyond.  So you're right, it wouldn't be unrealistic for it to end on a note of ambiguity.  Who ends up with whom?  Who knows?  They've developed something ""genuine"" in the meantime, and that's maybe more important than what comes next.  I wouldn't necessarily call that a cop-out.  Fact is, a lot of you guys duking it out over best waifu... I can't sympathize with you guys at all (though your threads are a lot of fun).  I'm going to be sad almost no matter what happens, because Yui and Yukino are both great and it's tragic that they're both chasing after the same guy (I like the other girls too but realistically only Iroha out of the rest is still in the running).  Unless they conspire to tie in the 8bowl and force a harem ending, somebody who didn't deserve heartbreak is going to get it.  Unless that happens, then whatever else happens, the ending is going to be tinged with melancholy for me.  Doesn't mean I wouldn't think its a good ending though.  It's all in the execution.  A couple weeks ago somebody posted an /a/ fanfic where 8man dies saving everybody from a burning bus.  I disliked that, not because an ending where he dies is intrinsically bad, but because the premise was underdeveloped and arbitrary.  As readers I think we have a reasonable expectation of this story not being resolved on account of pure random chance/diabolus ex machina."
OreGairuSNAFU,39jad7,guyofred,2,Fri Jun 12 04:15:13 2015 UTC,How did Haganai end? I never read it and don't plan to either.
OreGairuSNAFU,39jad7,socalso,6,Fri Jun 12 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"Rocks fall, everybody dies.  Sena and Kobato are the only survivors and end up together.  ...At least, that's what I told the last guy who asked me over on /r/Haganai.  I think that actually would have been a better ending than the one the series actually got.  As for what happened, a whole lot of crap behind the scenes.  Apparently the publisher kept jerking the author around, forcing him to add more fan-service and haremshit instead of letting him develop and extend that series' ""something genuine"" moments.  Then the illustrator fucked off to who knows where without telling anybody and caused at least two books to get delayed.  In the end, I think the author just gave up and scrawled out a random ending.  edit:  I'll put into roughly equivalent terms.  Imagine if, at the end of Volume 11, after months (story-time) of developing his romantic friendships in the Service Club, and having moments of intimacy with Yui and Yukino and Iroha, and promising Yui a date, and Yukino that he'll help her somebody, and taking responsibility for Iroha, and after all of the personal growth he's gone through - that on the last page, he runs into Kaori after school.  She kisses him, and he agrees to be her boyfriend.  The end.    Afterword: stay tuned for the epilogue!  Expected to arrive sometime after never!  It's not perfectly analogous because the character who pulled that stunt in Haganai did have a more developed relationship with Kodaka.  But relative to the other girls in the series, she shouldn't have even been a contender at that point.  There were so many other plot threads that were left unresolved and that the MC basically chose to ignore."

OreGairuSNAFU,39jb47,Y-Kun,4,Fri Jun 12 03:01:35 2015 UTC,"Ex1: Yukino's worried that 8man is going to do one of his stunts again. She doesn't like how he does things and tries to convince 8man that his method is shit. In her eagerness to convince, she slips up and says a few things un-Yukino like, like saying that the StuCo election isn't really important, and that the people behind it can just do whatever with the votes.  Ex2: IMO: He accuses himself because he betrays his ideals. He believes that shallow relationships aren't worth the effort. But he saved Hayama's clique despite that.  Ex3: Yes, it means that in the past, and maybe even in the present, he has/had feelings for a girl whose name starts with 'Y'. Most believe it's Haruno. But I'm thinking there's a chance it might be Yukino. Either way, the reason I see as to why he says he's never truly loved anyone before is because he doesn't do anything about his feelings. That's just my take on it.  Ex4: Probably his hate or dislike of shallowness? Or maybe his pride in himself or his methods. He is obviously referring to Yukino as that ""someone else"". And though they don't really talk about it, both share a lot of ideals - or convictions. And after betraying his, he feels like he betrayed her.  Ex5: 8man suffers from tunnel vision. This is just after Sensei tells him about Yukino running for presidency, we get the feeling that if Yukino does run, the service club then ends. Yukino is being her usual hard-headed self, she's being stubborn, she's preparing herself to tell Yuigahama about her plans, then comes 8man confronting her about her decision before she gets a word in. There's tension between them and they butt-heads. This causes a misunderstanding, which ultimately leads to 8man stomping Yukino's attempt to run for residency, and her getting depressed.  Well, here's what I think about it... others may have a different opinion though and that's part of what makes this series awesome."

I wish that at least the episode 12 preview were slightly more helpful. If volume 10 didn't warrant two whole episodes, I can't imagine that volume 10.5 would. I suspect neither volume 11 nor an anime-original ending [for the series as a whole] for the final episodes. Presumably, the coincidence of the end of S2 and the release of volume 11 is intentional, and I think that to provide ""closure"" of any sort in the final episode of the anime would be a terrible marketing decision for the LN. It would be much better to have a cliffhanger, wouldn't you think? Then again, I doubt that Feel gives a damn about LN sales, so my speculation might be off."

OreGairuSNAFU,393m6h,Stoick_the_Vast,23,Tue Jun 9 05:55:02 2015 UTC,"Talked about this a month or so ago on /a/.  Aside from being a recurring gag, I think there's something else to this.  Let's assume that his behavior doesn't imply homo- or bi-sexuality.  Why does he act like this around Totsuka?  Because it's safe.  There's no possibility of it leading to anything.  He can treat Totsuka the way he would have liked to have treated a girl if any would have him - because he knows, ultimately, that Totsuka is a dude (and presumably straight himself).  8man is not asexual.  What he is, is intensely repressed.  Every time he has ever attempted to develop an intimate bond with somebody (especially with girls he was interested in), he got shot down brutally.  So he clamps down ruthlessly on any open expression of interest in women.  We know from his internal monologues (from which we can draw some reasonable inferences) that he notices the beauty of the girls he knows.  He feels sexual attraction, he has a longing for intimacy.  He won't act on such feelings, though.  And he won't allow any of the girls he knows to act on them either.  The closest he can come to this is overtures of friendship, and even these are painfully wrung from him.  He can't act on suppressed feelings because experience has told him what that will lead to 100% of the time - not just rejection, but public shame and ridicule.  (A big part of the reason why No Longer Human/人間失格 resonates so strongly with him - his right to have normal human feelings has been denied to him at almost every turn, each time resulting in punishment for the temerity of thinking he was worthy of feeling love/affection for another).  But he's not a robot.  He's good at what he does, but he's still human.  He needs some kind of outlet.  So, Totsuka.  Totsuka is feminine, kind, beautiful, and not only tolerates being around him, but actively seeks him out.  Totsuka is safe (so is Zaimokuza, but that's a different situation altogether).  So, 8man takes advantage of Totsuka's kindness/passivity.  He acts out on feelings he's repressing all over the place.  Totsuka will do as a simulacrum of the kind of person he would have liked to have a relationship with as a more naive/less jaded youth - because he's a dude.  Nothing can come of it, and Totsuka is too kind (or has too much admiration) to lash out at him for being creepy.  TL;DR - I don't think 8man creeping on Totsuka implies that he's homo-/bi-sexual.  More likely, he is just acting out his repressed romantic inclinations because (according to painful experience), Totsuka is the only safe outlet he has."
OreGairuSNAFU,393m6h,socalso,5,Tue Jun 9 03:35:36 2015 UTC,"Let me change your TL;DR. 8man is at age which his sexual desire need to be soothed but got shot down non-stop by girls so he, ultimately, uses Totsuka as a 'material'."
OreGairuSNAFU,393m6h,TuanT1935,3,Tue Jun 9 08:04:16 2015 UTC,Not sure what you're getting at by making the 'material' distinction.  What do you mean?

OreGairuSNAFU,393m6h,icaelum,4,Tue Jun 9 03:14:31 2015 UTC,"It begins after school one day when Hayama asks 8man a favor—a special request, so to speak. Circumstances have led Hayama to be disowned by his family, and he needs a place to stay. He can't turn to Yukino, because he knows that her alliances aren't with him anymore, and he can't turn to his other friends, because he needs to be discreet. So he asks 8man if he can stay over at his house. 8man is hesitant for a few minutes, but then he relents and asks his parents. Of course they, the corporate slaves, assent (why not?), so Hayama moves in—b-but it's just temporary, okay? Lack of space in the Hikigaya house forces Hayama to sleep on a futon in 8man's floor. Though grateful for 8man's help, Hayama demurs when it comes to talking about the situation that brought him here. Soon, Hayama finds a place for himself in the Hikigaya household. 8man's parents are glad to see 8man socialize with such an upright character, and Hayama helps Komachi study for her exams in the areas that neither she nor 8man are not good in. At night, Hayama and 8man slip out alone for long walks in the neighborhood. It's a little cold this time of year, but neither of them minds. There's a small park not too far away where they go. They buy too-sweet MAX COFFEE from a nearby vending machine and sip their drinks on an old park bench. It's easier to talk when they sit side-by-side. One night, Hayama tells 8man that the reason why he was kicked out was because his parents found out he's gay. 8man's shocked for a bit, but soon recovers and says that it doesn't matter to him. Hayama laughs gently, with an air of self-deprecation. ""I was hoping that it would matter to you, actually,"" he says lightly. The night stirs through them both, and 8man watches small utterances of snow drift from tree branches overhead and into Hayama's soft brown hair. At length, Hayama begins to stand up, crushing the empty can in his fist, and 8man tells him to wait. The seconds pass, and 8man still needs time to think. Why did he take up Miura's request to investigate Hayama? Was it for her sake or for his own? Did he just want an excuse to talk to Hayama, to watch him, to wonder? He could feel the emotions swirling within him, like the dizzy snowflakes now fluttering from the sky. He clenches his grip on his MAX COFFEE can before releasing it. ""H-Hayama, I have a confession to make too—""  tl;dr: Just a running gag. You can read it as you want, but serious homosexuality is too progressive for LN's. Eastern social expectations for homosexuals are different from Western expectations anyhow."

If we're to consider it canon like 6.5, then whatever happens in 11 doesn't change the status quo, at least on the superficial level.  My opinion though is that vol 11 will focus on Yui's struggles as the main plot, and her development as a result. She's the one with the least growth in the main cast.   Watari can take this two ways:   The date, followed by a confession and rejection. Yui suffering follows and her growth as a character begins. Chances of this happening in this order are low if you consider 10.5 canon. Why? Because 8man is a sensitive dude, and would be phased by future interactions with Yui. The date, but no confession. If my hunch is correct, then that will be one akward date. Yui already being depressed after the final scene in 10 will decide to either put her confession on hold or give up on it all together. This is too meta for Watari though so expect one of his twists in the story.   These are assumptions, considering 10.5 as canon. Unless Valentines is in March in Watariverse. Yui's growth will be the main plot with anything else either happening in the second half or as a subplot.  Also there will be more Iroha."

OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,DaniSenpai,8,Mon Jun 8 12:52:19 2015 UTC,"Its actually surprising how hard it is to answer this. One of the main reason I started watching/reading this series because of the unique  protagonist and interesting viewpoint. This limited vision I had changed though, until I realized I sincerely cared for the characters as well as their interactions with each other. Character development reinforces this idea as well. Developing 8man was crucial in building a connection with him. Seeing him fall and work back up from the depths to where he is currently is one of the most satisfying things I've seen/read. Add to that a possible ""happy ending"" where he ends up someone would be icing on the cake and what a bunch of people are hoping for.   While I don't necessarily disagree, I am curious how this series will end with the amount of foundation it has built up from. As we are heading into the final arc of our view into 8man's life, I can say that the ride was great and I am excited to see a possible closure into his story."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,APassiveVoice,3,Mon Jun 8 06:36:34 2015 UTC,"What drew me into Oregairu was definitely the interesting and uniquely jaded MC. It was especially good timing for me since at the time I was trying to come off a binge watch of a ton (too many) of harem-school rom-coms and was looking for something just a little different.     What kept me in it was ... probably the character developments. I already thought the anime was amazing and gave it a 10/10, but when I discovered light novels about a year later I jumped on it and now it'd be an 11/10 if i could. Feel is doing a great job here too. For me it'd be somewhere between character development, relatable MC , and the writing. Even if I was an anime only viewer, I'd still say the writing has a big part in it.  Heck, I had no idea what shipping even was until about a year ago (ish?) when I discovered r/anime . Though I will admit it is only increasing my enjoyment to trash on the Yukinofags. The Yuifags just make me sad though q_q"
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,doominator10,7,Mon Jun 8 11:55:52 2015 UTC,"Relatable main character, it's so rare to find an anime centered around an actual loner, someone who really suffered (not in a beaten up way, but who was bullied, awkward from the start) and grew to be someone who didn't want any kind of relationship anymore, most people I've seen compare him to Oreki from Hyouka, but they're not the same.   It's the fact that he's not a ""riajuu"", he doesn't enjoy his high school life and didn't enjoy middle school either, because he's ""that weird kid that never talks"" that most anime never touch, because he doesn't have any childhood friend, no best friend to rely on, nothing, so finding a character that I can relate so much to, not only to his past, but his way of thinking (to some extent) and seeing the world, it's just something I never thought I'd find and was actually surprised with how popular it became."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,DaniSenpai,3,Mon Jun 8 13:03:13 2015 UTC,"It's the fact that he's not a ""riajuu"", he doesn't enjoy his high school life and didn't enjoy middle school either, because he's ""that weird kid that never talks"" that most anime never touch...   What I appreciate about 8man, too, is that there's basically no reason why he should be a loner besides that he was hit by a limo, which I guess is social suicide in high school. He has ""dead eyes,"" but he acknowledges that he has a handsome face otherwise. He dismisses others, but he has redeeming personality traits too. He likes anime, but he's not consumed in fantasy. He enjoys coffee, movies, and books—riajuu things. His alienation is, in reality, self-exile, because the only thing really standing in his way is himself.   And, as you say, the fact that he wants to grow to be someone who doesn't want that kind of relationship anymore is really interesting for the genre. In most high school anime, the protagonist leaves his boring world for a new, magical second world transposed on top of his old world (e.g., Haruhi, OreImo, Chuuni), but in the case of OreGairu, 8man leaves his boring world for the real world."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,sonanddeath,2,Mon Jun 8 13:35:16 2015 UTC,"Of the high school anime I've seen (haven't watched Haruhi or Chuuni so can't talk about those) I think this is the only one that touched what a middle schooler goes through, everyone gets ""bullied"", but not on the same way and not on the same level, as well as not everyone can take it the same way.   I'll use Rumi as an example, is it necessary to leave a classmate out? to exclude him from everyone and completely ignore him? No, but they still did, kids are cruel and those who are condemned by fate to be their target doesn't get a say on it, Hachiman realized this and decided that it wasn't worth it to go through all of that only to get a fake relationship.   Spoiler maybe? It's from volume 4 or 5, and doesn't change a thing."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,DaniSenpai,5,Mon Jun 8 13:50:04 2015 UTC,"The subliminal romantic banter so rare in anime, both past and present."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,GodEmperorPenguin,3,Mon Jun 8 06:50:05 2015 UTC,I wanted to pick multiple ones but I guess I went with Relatable setting. It's more or less tied with relatable MC. I'm a loner like 8man and read between lines a lot. I'm not as accurate but it's the same kind of things. I hate the people around me and I know the friendships won't sustain after high school. So seeing a different perspective in a different culture is really great.
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,CrazystuffIsee,3,Mon Jun 8 06:31:38 2015 UTC,"There's a few that I could go for, but I went with Character Development, since I find that's a factor that encompasses some of the other options whilst being the truest answer. This is going to be a rambling mess of a text wall.  The plot, the relatable characters, the character relationships, the writing, the relatable setting, all of it, in a way, go towards character development. You see a trio of people who are, by all means, totally different from one another, and you stay with them as they grow and change and mature and slowly realize the rather profound and unforeseen impact their friendship and actions and stories have had on one another. They don't just stay on a single spot - they go, be it forwards, backwards, or otherwise down some sparsely-trodden pathway.   The relatable setting and characters help, I'll be honest. I just graduated high school recently, and yes, most anime series do take place in high schools, with high-school age characters. I'm not some kind of genius like Yukino nor am I some kind of hilariously twisted character like Hachiman, nor am I as friendly and outgoing a person as Yui, but I can relate to the characters and the setting nonetheless. It's one of those times where I feel like the rather overdone setting doesn't take away from the story - rather, it gives.    And with friendship being such a central aspect to the story and having felt the commonplace boatload of insecurities most everyone in middle/high/whatever school feel not only about themselves, but about the people around them, it's a nice reminder of how nice highschool is, despite all the shit, and how nice friends can be.   So, Character Development. Mostly Hachiman and Yukino, since they are undeniably the ones who undergo the most drastic of changes within the series. It's a story about friendship and coming-of-age/maturity and, depending on how the story goes from now on, separation, reunion, and so many more possibilities. What is happening within the trio of protagonists (deuteragonist, tritagonist, blahblahblah) seems to be genuinely heartfelt due to the extensive character development, and I like it this way."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,ChineseMaple,3,Mon Jun 8 07:53:17 2015 UTC,"Dialogue  The script of this novel is simply outstanding. I'm not talking about the writing, plot or development. I'm talking about the monologues and conversations of the characters. All the characters have a good chemistry between each other. There isn't a single character who is left out as that character who only talks in one way toward everyone. Instead, they are given personalities to explain why X characters always acts like this. But when X is talking to Y, the result is completely different and the best part of this way of writing characters and dialogues is that it works. There is consistency in everything the characters say and do when interacting with someone else.  On the other hand, we have the monologues of Hachiman. It's surprising that despite the fact the entire thing is from a pessimistic POV, it still manages to be entertaining and attractive to the point you can find yourself paying more attention in order to not miss anything. The use of context was a great detail too. Another thing is how despite this is from Hachiman's POV, the series still manages to make clear that the guy is rotten and none of the things he says should be taken as complete truth. He's right about certain things to some exents but the story is constantly reminding us that his way of thinking is flawed, if not completely wrong. Such examples are his speech about nice girls which came after he made Yui cry. Through this, the story tells you that while it sounds correct, it's actually heavily mistaken.  Again, the script of this novel is simply outstanding. Dialogue man. I'm telling you."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Mon Jun 8 12:53:56 2015 UTC,"Preach it! I was hoping the dialogue would be assumed to be under writing, but upon further reflection, I realize that you may be right. Nevertheless, I agree that the dialogues and monologues are fantastic. I found it difficult to decide whether I liked the writing more due to the mindset of Hachiman being so relatable, or the refreshingly non-omniscient narrator, or the character interactions (dialogues are really only so interesting because of the writing and how the strongly held ideals of each character differ), or a variety of other reasons that can be written given more time and effort. Now that I think about it, I think that, in a way, since I found it so hard to choose (although in the end I chose relatable MC) I may have just made this thread to push my dilemma onto everyone else :P"
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,paladinmahdi,2,Mon Jun 8 17:38:54 2015 UTC,"My reason why I started watching was Yukino, lol yea a silly reason but I liked her design and her voice.    I wish I could choose more than one choice  because they are many But the reason why I fall in love with this show was   the writing in novel, relatable main character, character development and Hachiman's monologues.   and the primary reason is Yukino I relate to her too much.( same rude honest opinions, unsocial, cold ) personality without the perfect look and elegance though haha."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,Lonaticus,2,Mon Jun 8 07:09:12 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Iroha.  Long answer: In the begining, I liked the MC and his rather unorthodox way of solving things. Started reading this after having finished Onani Master Kurosawa and saw a certain connection between both series. Until vol 7 I just casually read it and didn't pay much attention to details. It was just another comercial LN for me.   The bamboo forrest event changed everything though. That's when I started paying more attention to the characters themselves and saw the unique potential this series has.  The moment it became my favorite was after 8man's  scene in vol 9.  Until vol 10, I loved the characters, their interaction, and minor developments, but I thought the writing itself is sub-par. The anime and j-culture references were annoying and kept reminding me of Monigatari novels.   Until now no LN has come even close in terms of quality writing to Bungaku Shoujo, with the exception of Spice and Wolf maybe. That's why I had low expectations in that category from this series. To my surprise, Watari's experiment with the memorandum chapters was pretty good. Even now people argue over who the true narrator is and if he/she differs in each chapter.   So I'd say, the writing is the thing I like the most right now, though you see how that can change.  As for Iroha, she became my favorite character gradually. She represents well how a child can grow into her own when influenced positively by the proper seniors/adults. She's also a good example of proper development for secondary characters and shows Watari's care. He could've easily kept her as a plot device like Zaimokuza."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,doominator10,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:23:12 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Iroha    Bwahahahahaah I should have wrote that. Yeah I think it was around the Xmas event / genuine that Oregairu became my favorite. I used to have it in S Tier with Monogatari, Fate/Zero, Kokoro Connect (Yes that's S tier for me bite me), but the LN's just shoved it into a tier of it's own for me. SS+ or something.    And yeah, Iroha is the only character that is on Hachiman's same level and I absolutely adore that in rom-com interests such as Kaoru  (Amagami SS) and Tomoya (Inou Battle ) By same level I think of it as Yukino is above 8man, Yui is below him, only other person who's on his level is Komachi."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,Lonaticus,3,Mon Jun 8 12:03:30 2015 UTC,"I don't like her for the shipping alone. I like her as an individual character. While most of the cast is comprised of emotional or intellectual superheroes in highschool, she's the only one who can be considered an actual 15-16 yr old highschool student.  What people can take from her character is that you don't need to be like the main cast, but can still learn and grow by following others and taking good advice from their actions. That's why I liked Iroha's train scene in the books. After all 8man's genuine confession shouldn't be exclusive just to the people in the club.  Edit: On phone, sry for typos."
OreGairuSNAFU,38zutk,doominator10,3,Mon Jun 8 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"Dang now I feel all bad as an Irohafag because I have to admit that the shipping is probably my biggest draw. Of course I really got into it when 8man and co. were doing the psychoanalytic breakdown of her during her election, but it's definitely her playful banter with 8man that sealed my allegiance.   Not saying the shipping is the end-all-be-all. Her and Hayama's development were great. Going from side characters to mains. But I just want my happy ending ;_; Actually screw it. Let's turn this show into an omnibus. Don't care anymore."

At the beginning, i didn't give Iroha much attention except that she kind of resembling Kawashima Ami from Toradora so i thought ""Oh, another well developed character, gotta love the show more"". But now i think about it, Iroha really is something: she doesn't suffer much from the anime influence so she gave off a vibe even more realistic yet still charming with her interaction with Hiki. And Watari's timing to put her in was good too as i was surprised that she can blend into the show naturally without even slightly damage it which is opposite to my first impression. Um, this is quite off topic but can you give me the reference to the discussion about the true narrator because now i'm kind of into these LNs so I'd like to have more knowledge about it."

There's actually a thread, that shouldn't be too low now, where it's discussed how the end will be adapted (if it is adapted that is) and most people agreed that a S3 is unlikely, but OVA's seem more feasible.   On the LN reading topic, it's worth it regardless of the adaptation for the end, just because of how much the anime skips, unless you're only interested in the Hachiman-Yukino-Yui relationship the LN are really great, because you get to see Hachiman interact with Zaimokuza, Saki, Komachi and, on top of all, we get more Saika."

But more developed, for sure.  The LNs have more of everything, compared to the anime.  I started on the anime, and I think its great, but sometimes you're getting less than half of the picture.

OreGairuSNAFU,38x61f,AnimeFreakXP,19,Sun Jun 7 16:29:56 2015 UTC,Yukinon -> her cute nickname   Yukinoshita -> her family name same as Haruno Yukinoshita.   Yukino -> Her name   Yukipedia -> also a nickname for her by Hachiman.
OreGairuSNAFU,38x61f,paladinmahdi,12,Sun Jun 7 16:57:29 2015 UTC,"This Not Really This (EDIT: Someone else probably got the more correct answer here: http://www.reddit.com/r/oregairusnafu/comments/38x61f/is_yukinon_a_short_ver_of_yukinoshita_or_longer_ver_of_yukino/crze0g6 )  This is as much of an accurate answer you can get without being incorrect.    Yukino is not a shortened version of Yukinoshita, Yukino is her first/given name. Yukinoshita is her family name.   The more endearing or closer you are to a person, the more acceptable it is to call them by their first name.  Hachiman calls her by Yukinoshita-san. Tobe referred to her as Yukinoshita-san when asking Hayama-kun a question in Vol 10.  Hayato calls her, by slip of tongue implying Spoiler, Yukino-chan during Vol 10. Haruno calls her Yukino-chan since they are sisters.  That said, the main user of the nickname ""Yukinon"" is Yui, first used in Vol 1 Chapter 3 in the following excerpt.   Despite that fact that Yukinoshita had politely declined, however, Yuigahama was humming unconcernedly as took out a cellophane package from her bag. They were clearly blackened cookies wrap in cute packaging.  “Well, it’s actually fun when you try it. Maybe I’ll try making lunch or something next! So anyway, Yukinon, let’s eat lunch together.”  “No, I like eating by myself so I don’t really want to…Also, please don’t call me ‘Yukinon’, it’s sickening.”  “No way, aren’t you lonely? Yukinon, where do you eat lunch?”  “In the clubroom but….Hey, are you listening to me?”  Source   From the above conversation, my opinion is that Yukinon is obviously a informal nickname that Yukino is uncomfortable to hear someone use (only to get used to it eventually).  Whether Yukinon is a short form of Yukinoshita or a cutesy way of Yukino, I would think the latter. Since being called Yukinon is just as uncomfortable as hearing someone call her by first name basis, what more if you see it as her first name tweaked to a more cutesy one.  EDIT: A flaw with this logic is that Yui nicknames 8man as Hikki, a derivative of his surname (Hikigaya). Why she doesn't call him by a nickname from his first name is something to think about. Maybe she's too shy/embarrassed to call him like that? Or just simply because Hikki is a way cuter nickname than say... Hachi~ shivers"

For example, Hachiman's nickname (at least for Yui) is Hikki, and it clearly comes from his last name Hikigaya.  Edit: mixed names"
OreGairuSNAFU,38x61f,DaniSenpai,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"Hachiman is his first name, while Hikigaya is his family name.   I don't know about Yukino, but Yukino calls Yui by her last name, so I think Yukinon  comes from her last name, based on their relationship, either way it can come from both.   Edit: after what r/Woowoo_Water said, I think it's from her first name, and you need to be very close and get permission in Japan to call someone with their first name, which I guess Yui forced that on Yukino."
OreGairuSNAFU,38x61f,paladinmahdi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, apparently mixed them both.   But on the topic, since Yui made a nickname from Hachiman's last name, it would make sense that she would do the same for Yukino, plus, it's more likely she used the same method for both, just cutting some letter (Hikigaya -> Hiki -> Hikki) ((Yukinoshita -> Yukinon), rather than adding a new one."
OreGairuSNAFU,38x61f,DaniSenpai,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"It can be either way for Yukino.  and for girls, it's easier to call each others with their first names, than a girl and a boy.   and like I said, I think Yui forced herself to call Yukino by her first name and added n like a John -> Johnny."

Yukino Yukinoshita = Yukinon Kakeru Tobe = Tobechi Totsuka Saika = Sai-chan To herself = Gahama-san   Yui's nicknames are all based on last names so the answer is Yukinon is a short ver. of Yukinoshita."

In fairness, OreGairu seems to have a much higher critical viewership/readership to casual viewership/readership ratio than most series have. I think that there are still some good topics for discussion (e.g., is OreGairu a romantic comedy?, what is the relationship between OreGairu and Haganai?, why did the character concepts shift so drastically in the earlier volumes?), but I feel that the essayists critical readers/viewers are basically stymied at this point until the Yukinoshita-Hayama relationship is clarified. Given that the series will likely be turning into more of a romantic comedy very soon, I hope that romance doesn't fog over the more interesting, psychological aspects of the series."

Though I don't actually know how their contracts with the Japanese companies work, but surely they send data on how many views they get.  Otherwise, I think most studios run on Blu-ray sales these days.  If its not already successful in Japan you'll never get an international distribution anyways, but when you do, I suppose they see some revenue from that."
OreGairuSNAFU,38v5wt,socalso,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:40:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I am streaming from my Crunchyroll account. I'm assuming the sales are successful in Japan with how popular it is right now as well, so I doubt we won't see an international release."

As far as the rest of us are concerned, though, what they'll really be paying attention to is how well the Blu Rays for season 1 will do.  They won't even consider giving us S2 if nobody shows up for the upcoming S1 release."

And make sure it gets a s3. Maybe Genga, Sakuga or other artbooks as well?    Not sure if they get any % from other merch. Maybe they do get a % as it features the character designs they made, as well as some original Ponkan8 art."

OreGairuSNAFU,38ukr9,TaeNySone,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:47:32 2015 UTC,"It's a lot deeper than just the money, or the ""affair"". The affair was an opportunity which Yukino took to corner her husband, but it was also a means of closure for her and 8man. The affair itself wasn't based on what they did, but how they felt. The emotional impact portrayed was much stronger than the deed-that was the intent of the writer."

The one scene we got with Yukimom definitely had her in the meek / fear / respect  mindset. Plus it's heavily hinted that both Haruno and Yukino considered Mom to be the final boss.    Are you sure she hasn't tried to reconcile before and it just didn't work? We still know little concrete info about their past.    8man hasn't done anything for Yukino and her family situation, not that he could even if he wanted to.    I'm loath to agree with Haruno (whose argument I think you're using) about what Yukino should be doing, but I do acknowledge that she is older and (in theory) more mature about these things.

Just that when Yukino&8man have scenes, they have more effect on the story and the plot. Like the water-fall scene instead of blushing/being nervous, they we're being honest with them-selves and getting out of their shells, and their faces show it.    the build up to the heartbreak that will be coming is killing me.

However, very little of that matters if they're not going to volume 11 (which is impossible) or having a third season (which I highly doubt we'll ever get) so the last 2 episodes will probably be some waifu pandering shit like the side stories but at least Watari wrote those.

How is that even gonna be possible Feel!?  The only good way I can think of is Vol 10 That would fit the length much better.  On another note, it would be nice if we could have a peek into vol 11 too. I don't think it would worth sacrificing vol 10 content for a side story at all.

There's no way right? but the next episode title is ""At all times, Hayama Hayato is answering expectations."", which is the chapter 7 title, covering up to the infirmary scene. If we go by that assumption, one episode is no where near enough to cover all this.   and you missed the infirmary scene and the after party   HOW COULD I MISS THAT! OTL (the after party is in chapter 8)"
OreGairuSNAFU,38ohm6,John137,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:36:34 2015 UTC,I can see volume 10 end at episode 12 if they trim some of the scenes. They're using the memorandum at the end of the episodes so it leads me to believe that like last season they will have a one episode story that's more light hearted. It can't be 6.5 bonus track but likely 10.5 chapter 1 given the setting and main characters involved. But that's a guess they could also go original.
OreGairuSNAFU,38ohm6,John137,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm asking, why do they need to rush ? Is it too important to waste the last episode for an original episode.   I wish they will adapt the whole volume 10 and end it with it.   I don't know if they can fit all 10.5 in 1 episode."
OreGairuSNAFU,38ohm6,LadWatcherIsHere,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:06:11 2015 UTC,I think it's because if you try to extend to episode 13 you aren't going to fill the block. If you're draggy to 13 you're making it almost like DBZ where they're just eyeing each other. (not saying it has to be the case but the context is DBZ had to drag out their scenes and one of the methods was this) as LN readers we see most things as important but the anime is still an advertisement for the LN and as much as we can call them out. They have to cut some things out to fit their logistics. Also keep in mind we seen 8man's monologues so in all cases they cut out his perspective a lot. That's almost too easy to trim down the events of volume 10.
OreGairuSNAFU,38ohm6,AnimeFreakXP,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"i feel like they're gonna try to finish volume 10 to be just in time for the release of volume 11, so that anyone that just finished the anime can just pick up and read the newly released volume from where the anime left off. i don't want them to rush it and honestly they don't have the time, but at the same time i don't want a lackluster ending."

Even just being university students would be nice.  Off the top of my head, I can only name a handful.  Steins;gate.  Golden Time.  Log Horizon.  That list really ought to be longer."
OreGairuSNAFU,38mhkb,socalso,5,Fri Jun 5 07:31:36 2015 UTC,"It's tied in with their mentality and society in general. For your average overworked  Japanese salaryman, highschool especially was the best time of their lives, cause they had free time to do what they liked.  For hard core otaku... well... mentally and emotionally they are stuck at high school teenage level. No point in sugar coating this.  Main audience is young people though,so they need characters they could relate to easily.  I'd say the perspective becomes even clearer for people who interacted with Japanese society more. I only got to stay there for 6 months."

OreGairuSNAFU,38mhkb,socalso,4,Fri Jun 5 11:50:35 2015 UTC,"Ha, it's been a secret theory of mine that writers like Watari use high school as a setting for character dramas to retroject epiphanies and somehow redeem their high school years. Because as I'm watching, I think that it certainly would have been convenient for me to have had a volume 9 realization when I was sixteen instead of years later. Though I'm a fewseveral years older than the Yahari cast, I feel that I'm not too far away from them on more of a spiritual level, having properly indulged in a jaded youth, thank you."
OreGairuSNAFU,38mhkb,sonanddeath,3,Fri Jun 5 14:13:59 2015 UTC,"There are dozens of series out there where an adult otaku/salaryman/low wage worker who made the wrong decisions in life magically gets sent back in time or spirited into a younger person's body.

Most people (or at least I hope I wasn't the only one) don't realize this, I mean, they are the best when you look back, and you just wish you had done more, use them more, enjoyed them more.

OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,socalso,13,Fri Jun 5 01:14:07 2015 UTC,"Rushed, yes, but it's a sensible choice for adaptation.  The montage of the Christmas event was a better choice than giving it its own whole half an episode.  The sakisaki fags even get thrown a bone - I was not expecting them to bother showing the little sproglet at this point.  Cute kid.  Saki in mom mode was great.  Tamanawa blowing his hair = gold  Sly Iroha and Competent Iroha = gold  Yui in glasses = gold  Sort of remember 8man trying on a pair too and getting a nice reaction from Yui... shame that didn't get in there.  First glimpse at Yukino's glasses though.  Haruno bullying Yukino = platinum (mad)  My moon isn't quite good enough to follow fully (not in one viewing at least) so I can't comment too much here just yet.  They seem to have got the tone of it right, but it felt a little bit condensed.  I expected to see her torturing of Yukino and Hayama drawn out a little more.  Pays off big time with Yukino's reaction to realizing the trap she's fallen into when Yukinoma shows up on the scene though.  I'm not going to complain about Feel covering volume 10 material this season.  Obviously in a perfect world they'd be able to take their time with the material and do it all with more episodes.  But I'd rather them get up to speed and decrease the chance of getting hit with a lame anime-original ending because it's too much trouble to animate what may turn out to be more remaining volumes than they expect (if Wataru Watari goes beyond a Volume 12, I mean)."
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,manamono,8,Fri Jun 5 04:27:31 2015 UTC,Saki in mom mode was great.   This.
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,guyofred,11,Fri Jun 5 14:18:33 2015 UTC,Rushed. It burned through pages like a motherfucker but they also did that with every non-volume 9 episode. We also got 2 montages and one with Yukitoki so I'm not too upset.   The title of the next episode has the same name as the title of chapter 7. If they're going to cover that far I think they might just end it there. I really hope they don't because volume 10 was really good. If they do what do we have for the 2 episodes after that? Anime original ending? Side story?   I really like how they did the memorandum with the prime candidates speaking it.
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,Lonaticus,5,Fri Jun 5 03:33:23 2015 UTC,"Too rushed! We didn't get to see bishounen 8man with glasses!!!  They covered all necessary plot points, though I feel the setting for Iroha's ""please take responsibility, Senpai"" could've been done better. Rumi's part was a bit rushed too.  Edit: If they rush vol 10, they can do 10.5 in one or 2 eps. Iroha fans, rejoice!  Though I think it might end on a vol 11 cliffhanger just to get people to read the ln's. Maybe animate 1 or 2 scenes from it? The ending is paramount Feel! Don't screw this up!"
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,FrozenFyre,8,Fri Jun 5 05:35:52 2015 UTC,If 10.5 ever gets adapted I won't be able to control myself.

OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,CrazystuffIsee,3,Sat Jun 6 17:00:35 2015 UTC,We missed the real RumiRumi moment there....... but all they had to do near the end was instead of showing the 3 together cut some of that time and show Rumi in the crowd smiling. I think I could deal with all of what they did but they missed some good moments.
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,Lonaticus,5,Fri Jun 5 05:38:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the RumiRumi smile was maybe the most important part that was cut. Hopefully they'll fix it in the blu-rays"
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,manamono,2,Fri Jun 5 05:45:13 2015 UTC,"I really like volume 10 too q_q. In a sense, the very key scene of volume 10 could be fit into one episode I guess, but then again in the less important scene still holds a lot of clues and thoughts. I really hoped that the next episode doesn't cover up to the race. It would be too lame to end the season with a side story after all these build-ups."
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,LadWatcherIsHere,12,Fri Jun 5 15:31:35 2015 UTC,"I know there was a lot of scenes to look at during this episode but to me that moment was the best of this entire show.  It's incredible that even though this series has no antagonists, Wataru still managed to create a character that we could grow to loathe thus making it all the more satisfying when we finally watch him being put on his place."
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,RalphZiggy,6,Fri Jun 5 03:48:27 2015 UTC,I think Hatchiman started as the antagonist of sorts; but the list of people who changed their minds about him keeps growing.
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,LadWatcherIsHere,9,Fri Jun 5 04:19:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say antagonist since that's a role focused on getting in the way of the protagonist, who in this case is none other than Hachiman.  If I had to come up with something right now... I'd say he's the bad guy of this story. Almost all his decisions are cruel and self centered. He doesn't help people but instead tricks them into thinking that their problems are gone but in reality he just avoided the storm. But the problem is still there.  I guess Rumi really had an impact on him. He was truly surprised to see that his methods were only making things worse."
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,Lonaticus,11,Fri Jun 5 04:25:22 2015 UTC,An anti-hero is more appropriate
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,RalphZiggy,3,Fri Jun 5 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"But look how he's grown from that, into a hero for many that now look up to him.  In that strategy meeting, and then with the way he derailed the useless feel-good train of the committee , he's now like a boss.      And he now really cares about people, look at that smile on seeing Rumi be a star."

OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,manamono,6,Sat Jun 6 16:34:50 2015 UTC,The biggest thing that bothers me is how 8man was staring at Hayama in the end of the episode. In LN it's entirely different:  LN Spoiler
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,AnimeFreakXP,3,Fri Jun 5 14:02:47 2015 UTC,"well, its suits the situation better in the anime since the meeting area is quite small and theres no windows"
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,manamono,3,Sat Jun 6 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"well true, but still, making him stare at Hayato like that is creepy and out of nowhere. In LN, 8man neither thought about nor showed any hatred to Hayama at all in that scene. The anime made it look like 8man blaming Hayato (or even being jealous of him), which is very out of character for 8man and could lead to misinterpretation."
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,AnimeFreakXP,2,Sat Jun 6 19:01:20 2015 UTC,he's not jealous of him since he knew yukino doesn't like him at all. so the odds are at 8man favor
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,manamono,2,Sun Jun 7 03:55:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you, Captain Obvious!   Of course I knew that, but there are people out there who think 8man did that coz he was irritated by hayato calling yukino by her first name there. That kind of understanding would never happen without this additional scene. Did you see my point now?  We are talking about an anime that people try to analyze every single scene each episode here, and this scene is obviously no exception. 8man's glare is obviously a negative glare, and what could it possibly originate from? BAM! you reach the two conclusions I mentioned; That's how misleading that scene is."

OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,socalso,3,Fri Jun 5 05:42:54 2015 UTC,"oh wow that was rushed, considering the amount that happened, i think feel is just trying to make sure they finish volume 10 probably. i wonder if they're planning on a third season, though that would be a bit problematic considering how much is left in the novel although maybe watari plans to extend it by at least a few more volumes, here's hoping. there's just a lot of stuff missed it here damn. a lot of character building not seen animated. and dang the isshiki scene i was so looking forward to was even rushed, that was a scene where momentary pauses would've really effective, but oh well still a pretty good episode. after watching it though, there's a part of me that wonders if watari will pull a similar thing as twgok's ending in the manga, hopefully not. also considering we have three episodes left, i wonder if feel got a hold of volume 11 early or something and is heading to rush towards that or something thinking they have to include it somehow. because the last episode comes after the release of volume 11, i think june 18 right? well hopefully they do well with the confrontation scene at the very least and hopefully the season ends well and not midway through a chapter."
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,NotCleanDan,3,Fri Jun 5 11:09:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, and another thing.  With everybody contributing to the reading of the Interlude at the end of the episode, can we interpret that as one answer to the lingering question of who each of these Interludes was supposed to be about?  In other words - any/all of them.  I don't mean to say that Feel's interpretation is necessarily definitive (only the author could settle that, ultimately, if we assume literary deconstruction is irrelevant here), but it is an answer of sorts, isn't it?"
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,RalphZiggy,3,Sat Jun 6 06:26:44 2015 UTC,Sooo is Haruno a bitch or not?
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,EspadaPrimera,4,Sat Jun 6 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"Well she does want Hikki to be with Yukino, so ultimately I have to forgive her for  her teasing and meddling with Hachiman for her own amusement.  Now if she badly bullied Yukino in the past,  then I might not forgive her.  But it's hard yet to tell if that was the case or if it was just the more normal sibling rivalry and fighting.  I think Yukino implies there is more hurt from the family treating her as a ""just a substitute"" , while Haruno the family darling and one who is representative for corporate and family functions."
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,LurkToRed,2,Sat Jun 6 14:31:34 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me the ending of this episode? Yukino didn't show up to her own party because it was superficial right? And what was up with all the glances between the characters?
OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,EspadaPrimera,5,Fri Jun 5 16:48:24 2015 UTC,"Yukino's sister tricked her into showing up by using 8man as a lure. 8man figured it out and glared at Hayama because Hayama knew what was going on all along. Yukino then glanced at 8man with a face that screamed ""Save me"" which is a reference to her asking 8man to save her someday.   This is all I got. I haven't read the novels, only watched the anime, and this is my best guess as to what was going on."

OreGairuSNAFU,38lrjn,dcalrokundess,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:09:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's because she's no longer the only character, since  now Yui, Yukino and Hachiman are back together the story will most likely circle around them again, though she will still be part of the series, maybe we won't see her as much"

OreGairuSNAFU,38k896,Lonaticus,8,Fri Jun 5 05:59:48 2015 UTC,"That's what fan means dude. To love that person/character for your reasons. Just because you don't like her doesn't make her a bad character.   She's evil? Ok, nice. How does that makes her someone to be hated by the audience? Even Hachiman is even more evil than her.  Not even cute? Sure. I guess anime cuteness gives you cancer... or you simply don't like her design. A side character, a plot device? Dude. That's what a side character is. They're added to the story to move the plot and create circumstances that have repercussions in the main character.   If what you dislike is her design and her personality then you simply don't like her. Doesn't make her someone who has to be disliked. That's just your preferences. You have yours and we have ours. She's good in terms of characterization which is the most important part of a character. It's only normal that she gets a lot of love from the fans."
OreGairuSNAFU,38k896,LadWatcherIsHere,-8,Fri Jun 5 02:09:08 2015 UTC,"You're joking right? She tells everything she knows about 8man to Haruno, she is a wedge in between the friendship of Yukino, 8man, and Yui causing a small divide between them, I don't hate that people best girl her more of less they ship her. Hachiman isn't so low that he would ditch his friends for someone he considers his sister. He only did what he did for the student council was to save his friendships by using her, then went to help her because he was responsible for what he did. 8man doesn't care for her like that, he cares for her because he sees her as a sister. I hate her because preferences, and how evil she is. She is the demon of the devil herself Haruno.  Anime cuteness gives me cancer? I think Yui and Yukino are cute as hell. Her cuteness is nothing but fake, she fakes it and that is what I hate about it.  But I don't care I am just going to put Iroha fans on ignore and hide iroha post. So I don't continue shit posting  Iroha fans are almost non existent, but I agree with your opinion. I let my anger get the best of me. So I have solved the problem. By of course hiding iroha post and ignoring the fans."
OreGairuSNAFU,38k896,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,5,Fri Jun 5 00:45:02 2015 UTC,"Again. You fail to see the point. It isn't if she's good or bad. Morals have nothing to do with how good a character is. If you were right then how come villains are really loved in entertainment? They spend the entire show/book/game making you hate them and even so they still get loved by the fans.  Why is that? Simple! The villain was a good character.  Iroha fans love her because of her character. Whether she's a good person or not, and if her cuteness is real or fake (actually the cute part is in the fact that she fakes it just like how Yukino acts cold but has a dere side too) are things that one can either hate or love about her character.  And are you the one who's joking? You say that you will ignore the Iroha fans because you hate them and yet you seek them to tell them that they're sh-t? Good logic there bud."
OreGairuSNAFU,38k896,LadWatcherIsHere,6,Fri Jun 5 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"This so much.  I hate it when _______-fans go out of their way to shit on another person's taste, especially when it isn't simple friendly banter. To each their own should be the way to go.  Watari's writing for this series has been so on point that you really can't fault him for any of the characters. Whether you like them or not, most (if not all) characters play an extremely important role and are excellent at what they are designed to do. While Iroha isn't my favorite, I acknowledge that she's an amazing character for what she's intended to be."

OreGairuSNAFU,38k896,kethxenn,6,Fri Jun 5 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"I suppose at this point I shouldn't even be surprised when I encounter yet another shitpost in your name.   People love her and she is a side character, a plot device nothing more.   And? You seem to use this as an attack rather often, especially in ship wars. Are side characters simply unlikable? By being a side character, does that mean anyone who enjoys when she's on the screen/page is wrong to? Even you call her a plot device, which makes her important to the story in one way or another. By definition of plot device, if we assume the story centers around Hachiman and his interactions/relationships with the rest of the cast, Yukino is a plot device. Shall we burn her on an upside down cross while dancing around it?  As for Iroha being evil? Naw. She might be manipulative, but she's not evil. Hell, she's human, even more so than a lot of characters in anime. She's enjoyable, just like the rest of the cast.  Regardless, Yui is still best girl."
OreGairuSNAFU,38k896,shortofsane,4,Fri Jun 5 15:45:17 2015 UTC,"One really has to admit that Yui's charm is in how genuine she is compared to the rest of the cast. While everyone else has ulterior motives, everything Yui does is a reflection of her personality. That's why she's considered the glue in the Service Club. Knowledge can only carry you so far but Yui's honest feelings and genuine attempts to make everyone happy always keeps everyone together. It's good to have a character who acts as the antithesis of what the series' main plot focuses on by making her so simple minded."
OreGairuSNAFU,38k896,LadWatcherIsHere,6,Fri Jun 5 03:43:37 2015 UTC,"She's really not as dumb as people make her out to be, though. Even Orimoto commented on how challenging/tough it was to get into Sobu High. When compared to 8man and Yukino, she might seem a little slower, but she's still competent. Hell, she has a gift that most of this cast doesn't seem to have: she understands herself, her feelings, and why she does things.   Not that you were calling her dumb, but I felt the need to clarify. xD"
OreGairuSNAFU,38k896,shortofsane,7,Fri Jun 5 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"She understands herself, her feelings, and why she does things.   That's what I meant by simple minded. Yui doesn't need to go on deep analysis and monologues about the things that happen. She actually makes it look so easy, to understand why she does things because to her, that's just a fact. While Hachiman and Yukino have a hard time dealing with so many feels, Yui is more honest about who she is and what she wants thus making her the perfect companion for these two who move purely by logic rather than feelings."

OreGairuSNAFU,38g9fw,guyofred,5,Thu Jun 4 01:35:05 2015 UTC,"I improvised it, because just simply leaving it as ""over there"" sounded wrong, or lacking in something. そこへ kind of sounds weird without additional context - for example if you imagine someone just saying ""そこへ"" and not doing anything, all you know is the subject is ""over there"" but you don't know where.   Imagining someone saying ""そこへ"" while pointing at something gives you some more visual information, and that's how I thought about it, and in the song Nagi implies she's in a garden, or some place that flowers and new plantlife can grow - ""綺麗な花は 大事に育てでも 遠慮ないの土足で 簡単に風み躙られた""  In Oregairu terms, I'd imagine this refers moreso to the club room and the school, although that seems more obvious than not haha. You're right, though, I don't see how 'promised land' could come up as anything but them using a thesaurus for ""over there"".  And yeah, that caught my attention when I first heard it haha.

OreGairuSNAFU,38g9fw,LadWatcherIsHere,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:53:55 2015 UTC,"/u/guyofred  The song itself doesn't make it clear. It simply says Over there so the one who actually improvised was Commie.  There are several sentences in their translations that were altered to make them more entertaining to read.  For example, instead of saying I'll look for it over there, Commie changed it to I'll go looking for it in the promised land because it has a better ring to it.  I think xKaillus did a good job with this translation. The meaning of the song is there in the english lyrics too. There isn't much difference."

Referring to a place multiple time gives it an special meaning. If that place is used to describe the place I wanna go, then, most translators would use something fancy to refer to it.  To be fair, you're not making a mistake here. Everyone else just likes to change the lyrics to their taste."
OreGairuSNAFU,38g9fw,CrazystuffIsee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:07:26 2015 UTC,Using just Commie as a base for knowledge isn't good enough of an argument. Using Commie + 2 other translations would probably tell enough if there is an alteration. Also Commie memes the series anyways. A good clear one is how they change senpai to Hikigaya. The take some of the meaningful stuff to make it appear better and that's to their own discretion.
OreGairuSNAFU,38g9fw,guyofred,3,Thu Jun 4 03:02:02 2015 UTC,"FFF and Commie uses the same translation last I checked and I really don't know any other sub group for this show to compare with and I don't think Crunchy does OP/EDs. OP also said that he added it to make it sound nicer which I can see why and Commie did it as well for the same reason I assume.  I don't really see how changing ""senpai"" to ""Hikigaya"" is memeing it, it's just localization. From the little I watched they actually seem to be doing a good job with the show. Better than Crunchy who outright mistranslates, anyways."
OreGairuSNAFU,38g9fw,CrazystuffIsee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:13:32 2015 UTC,Right I probably had a sudden moment of misunderstanding on memeing but in some cases they'll change it anyways. They added Geico in the first episode.

This translation pretty much kills ambiguity and changes lyrics to make it sound nicer.   e: Made a rough translation based off what you (FFF) said and the lyrics off the top of my head. Too lazy to actually look it up.    A perfected theory to fill the void\ Was supposed to be correct  But I ended up in pointless circles   It never really said what went went in circles so I just went with the speaker since it makes more sense. Well to me anyways.    The future is warped\ And all it takes is a crack  For it to be twisted even more\ And stray further from ideal   Don't really mind the unknown beast too much even though that's not what it said at all. I prefer ""ideal"" over ""perfection"" here because that's what they used.   The lukewarm water made the sound of going cold  If I'm changing my path\ It's time now   This is one of the killing ambiguity ones. The water can refer to a lot of things but FFF decided to make it the path. I always interpreted it as the situation in the club.    I don't need this replica\ I just want something to call ""genuine""   I opted for genuine here for the sake of Yahari and it's the same word Hachiman used. Otherwise I probably would've used ""real.""   I'll go look for it over there   They never specified where ""there"" is. There is no ""promised land."" I don't know what the fuck Yanagi Nagi is looking for but Hachiman wasn't searching for his genuine relationship there.    ""But that just seems like a well-made fairy tale,"" you whispered to me   No idea what FFF meant there.   For the most part nothing is ruined but I'm just saying for future reference use literal translations."

To be honest, literal translations don't make much difference. Even with the literal meaning, the result is still the same. The only difference is the final part of the song but that's a mistake from the translators.  Still, I wonder what it means. Who exactly is telling the singer that they're wrong?"

What I'm guessing it means is that something genuine is too good to be true and doesn't exist but you probably got that part already. so the question is ""who."" In terms of Yahari I think it's either Hachiman in the back of his mind or Haruno, who says that outright."
OreGairuSNAFU,38b90x,guyofred,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"One word: ""Context""  The translations are ok but the meaning changes in a full sentence. Your translation is too literal. Add the context and find a meaning of the sentence. If I say ""He's that guy who's actually pretty cool"". What you would translate that as would be ""That guy he's pretty cool"".  There are rules too in this language. Don't just find the meaning and write it as such. No offense by the way. Just trying to help."
OreGairuSNAFU,38b90x,LadWatcherIsHere,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:46:33 2015 UTC,There's no ambiguity or anything in that sentence. It's pretty straightforward. How would you translate it then?
OreGairuSNAFU,38b90x,guyofred,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"The answer is in your translation. It's pretty well done but holds a different meaning in context given that some words can change depending on how you use it.  よく できた = Yoku dekita  見たい = Mitai  Yoku dekita can be translated as Well done or Well-made but japan isn't different than us when it comes to using it for different meanings depending on how they use it. It can also be used to refer to doing it well if it's added to the correct sentence.  In the case of ""Mitai"", it can be translated as a I wanna see in a straightforward way but it also can refer to look, like you pointed out, or way. Fairy tale + Mitai = A Fairy tail way.  If we were to translate it in a literal way then the result would be this:  But that is good fairy tail I wanna see.  That's why context exist.   Also, sorry for my shitt_ english example. I was using cellphone just a few moments ago."

Who would you trust more than anyone else in the world? She doesn't trust her family, so who is next? She has confided in him what career path she is choosing and she only told 8man, not even Yui knows. Because she knew that Haruno wanted to know it. So she thought she could trust 8man in knowing it. Also Haruno believes that their is nothing genuine in this world. Hachiman does, he believes that his friends can provide it."

We're at the final arc and I doubt Watari will settle with two novels (10 & 11) to end the entire novel. Plus that cover isn't what I expect from the final cover of the series.  I expect Volume 11 to be the beginning of the darkest hour where we'll get a lot of answers, crazy developments and then Volume 12 will be the climax of everything where Hachiman will have to make a lot of choices to get his... happy ending.

No. Volume 11 right now is the Climax of the story, so I can see at least 1 to 2 more volumes after this one.

OreGairuSNAFU,387o77,ImAlAl,10,Tue Jun 2 13:06:09 2015 UTC,"Haruno seems to be the most popular answer in this thread, on /r/anime, and on /a/ as well. I have some misgivings about it. Hayama refers to Haruno by her first name, so I don't see why the initial 'Y' would refer to her through her family name. Meanwhile, at school he staunchly refers to Yukino as Yukinoshita-san, but once, in volume 10 Regardless, I imagine that volume 11 will clarify the incredibly nebulous Yukinoshita-Hayama relationship.  Then again, I think that Hayama can legitimately be understood as gay: up to volume 10 spoilers A gay character whose sexuality isn't for gag purposes might be a bit too progressive for light novels, though. In some way, I think that a ""Hayama is gay"" revelation would strengthen his character, but it would redirect the inevitable love triangle.  Of course, that wouldn't answer the 'Y' question when, clearly, the right answer is ."
OreGairuSNAFU,387o77,sonanddeath,2,Tue Jun 2 15:12:13 2015 UTC,"He might be gay since the original question posed to him by Tobe was which girl did you like, he could have meant to say ""why?"", implying his homosexuality. However judging by his guilt to Yukino and the quote by Haruno stating that Yukino wasn't chosen again suggests that in the past Yukino may have liked Hayama but Hayama prefers Haruno."

OreGairuSNAFU,387o77,paladinmahdi,3,Tue Jun 2 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"I'm frankly unqualified to defend 8man/Yukino (and actually quite indifferent toward it), but to justify why I said that, I'm drawing on the following lines specifically from volume 10, chapter 8. But to preface it,    Volume 10, Chapter 8:            Here, there is room for a few interpretations. The first is that , which I think is correct, but I also think that there's more to it than that. The second comes at the end of the novel. Here, 8man alludes to      I agree with you that I don't think that anyone properly understands their feelings yet, but they are starting to manifest."

OreGairuSNAFU,387o77,socalso,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"I was thinking it's Yukino. Hayama stated that him and Hachiman never actually had anyone they really liked, and perhaps he was referring to himself having a crush on Haruno in the past which he thought was love at the time. Maybe that ties in with what Haruno stated about Yukino not being picked again. However, I don't think it's Haruno since he doesn't refer to her by her family name."
OreGairuSNAFU,387o77,ShrewOne,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:14:45 2015 UTC,"It is also possible that he liked Haruno, but Yukino liked him. That'd set up a love triangle that would tear their relationship as childhood friends into shambles. The person Yukino liked had feelings for the perfect(in her view) sister that she was only a shadow of. It'd reinforce the idea that she was only a shadow, a poor copy of her sister. So much so that Hayato-kun would become Hayama-kun.  Either way, no matter which sister he liked, it's going to be interesting. Shit is going down!"

IMO there isn't really a point to pointing out the really basic / simple stuff because frankly:  1) that doesn't really encourage discussion  2) that's boring to write about  HOWEVER THIS DOES NOT MEAN I'M DISCREDITING YOUR OPINION.

OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,AeroSkyline,5,Tue Jun 2 04:49:43 2015 UTC,"There are differences:   About the LN: That's a thing in LNs and Anime. The characters are always having inner thoughts and stuff like that to the point it can become rather tedious. That's something the creators and writers do all the time to add more material to their storyboards. It's the difference between normal books and LN. About Hachiman: That's part of his character. He's that kind of person, the one who always analysis everything. It's why he's been called a Beast of Logic because he always has second thoughts about every single detail and never stops looking at people like enemies waiting for him to lower his guard. The other reason is that he doesn't like to talk much. All humans have their moments when they feel like they have something to say but end up keeping it to themselves. Hachiman is the same, only that his moments are basically every single moment of his life. He's actually pretty funny but prefers to remain quiet and see how things develop rather than interfering. About the fans: They do it because it's funny. What you see as a headache-inducing, the fans see it as a hobby. Something that they enjoy. Writing an analysis about something so simple yet complex is funny. I know because I'm always in /r/anime every time a new episode comes out only to read the essays of fans.   So in summary: You dislike it. But other people enjoy it. It's that simple, no need to over analyse this topic my friend."
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,LadWatcherIsHere,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:31:55 2015 UTC,"I can understand your point, I guess I was only thinking about it from my own perspective (I hadn't even considered that those people write those long responses purely out of enjoyment, although now that you mention it, it makes more sense than any other reason I could think of). I guess I'm just a little frustrated that, as someone who has finished reading all the source material and is following the anime rather casually (often not watching the latest episode until a few weeks later) it is sometimes rather difficult to understand and follow the various character dynamics, as well as the meaning behind each person's words and actions, especially when the anime/LN is being intentionally vague. I can kinda understand that therein lies the reason for such complicated discussion and over-analysis but it is a bit annoying when I go to discussion threads to find answers and a consensus among opinions and end up leaving more confused than I was before I entered the thread."
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,LadWatcherIsHere,3,Tue Jun 2 08:24:26 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I can't imagine why would you go to those places in order to find something different. That's one of the things that a fandom does all the time. They make long analysis about everything and point out everything, even the smaller details and give them a deeper meaning.  If they're not busy making something simple look complicate then they're doing fanworks, speculation or shipping."
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,socalso,6,Tue Jun 2 10:19:49 2015 UTC,"Everybody else who responded was more gentle with this than it deserves.  That's a credit to this community.  They're good folks, generally.   unnecessarily complicated   as compared to what?  It is a show with complex characterizations.  The plots aren't necessarily complex, but they don't have to be in a character-driven story.  Any reading of the show that begins from a place that says there is no complexity is extraordinarily fringe, at least if your basis of comparison is to other light novels/anime adaptations.     rants are too long   This is not the series for you, then.  Part of the attraction of Oregairu amongst the diehards is that 8man is so verbose and talks too much - its a character trait, and a compelling one.   words are too long   dictionary.com is a google search away.  Expand your vocabulary.   more people should simplify discussion   No, we're not going to do that.  If that's the conversation you want to have, start your own thread.  The rest of us enjoy having (possibly) over-complex debates and discussions about this show and will continue to do our thing in the threads we start.  It's what most of us come here for - we like that there's an articulate, hyper-analytical community here who can really probe into these stories beyond superficial readings.  There's room for silly shallow discussions, but the people posting threads about which waifu should win the 8bowl are the same people in the denser discussion threads.   pretentious and intentionally uninformative, sorry if I'm rude   But telling everybody to stop having fun over-analyzing a show we love isn't pretentious of you?  Get off your high horse.  A lot of us started off unable to follow the threads of conversation around this series and eventually found a place in it for ourselves - not by demanding that everybody else dumb down the conversation, but by lurking moar and asking questions.  Consensus is that this is a more complex show than your average rom-com and that there's a demand for the kind of discourse that evolved in the fandom, even in less-regulated places like /a/ where its easy for threads to descend into circle-jerks and trolling.   my hobbies   It's our hobby too, and I'd say most of us like the community and the discourse as it exists.  As I said, feel free to start a thread where analysis is curtailed and only the simplest explanations are permitted.  Maybe that'll appeal to some others too.  If being here gives you a headache, pop some aspirin, develop a stronger constitution, or find a sub more suited to your tastes.  We're not going to stop doing what we love doing to suit the tastes of the lowest common denominator."
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,doominator10,3,Tue Jun 2 09:42:12 2015 UTC,"people ... about which waifu should win...denser threads   Is there something wrong with liking both q_q. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy some deep character analysis and motivational studies to really get into a story, but I also enjoy trashing on Urdnot non-believers in the war.   Unless you meant dense as in more populated instead of denser in the head. In which case, ah."
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,socalso,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:48:38 2015 UTC,"Dense as in complex.  Honestly, watching you guys duke it out is a lot of fun.

Keep doing your thing, don't let anybody else come in and tell you you're doing it wrong - that's all I mean."
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,Zereon,2,Tue Jun 2 18:13:22 2015 UTC,"It seems strange to affirm a well written rebuttal with the following simplistic remark, but I think its somehow appropriate here.  SORE ARU!"
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,socalso,-2,Wed Jun 3 09:06:08 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding something. I don't have any problem with people discussing things to great detail. I find myself frustrated at people (obviously not everyone) who go out of their way to over-complicate things. Despite what you may believe, discussions don't have to be set-out in a way that is unnecessarily hard to interpret or understand in order to discuss complex content."
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,paladinmahdi,2,Tue Jun 2 10:38:17 2015 UTC,"I think its very clear where the misunderstanding is coming from here.  Because the conversation is above your head, you assume it must be because people are deliberately using difficult words to confuse less literate people.  That the way we converse amongst ourselves is characterized by unnecessary difficulty.  Your assumption is insultingly wrong and your conclusions drawn from it are wrong.  That's all there is to it.  Nobody decided to talk about this series with ""unnecessary"" complexity.  That conversation arose naturally out of the recognition that this is, actually, a story written with some complexity beyond the norm for its genre.  To insinuate that we're talking the way we talk as affectation is obnoxious.  You don't get to decide for the rest of us what is and isn't ""necessary"" to keep our discourse alive.  If its too difficult for you to interpret, the fault for that doesn't rest in us.  I'm guessing most of us around here have at least some college education and there's at least one English professor on the sub that I'm aware of.  We're accustomed to a more sophisticated discourse.  There's plenty of us here who will stop what we're doing to explain things to a newcomer, because this community is generous and kinder than most.  The rest of the time, we're pretty happy to use language at our level to discuss a story that's at our level.  Again, if that doesn't suit you and you're not willing or able to learn some multi-syllabic words, that's not our problem."
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,iskow,2,Tue Jun 2 19:24:00 2015 UTC,"Because some parts are really complex and make you want to think about them, they don't hand it to you in a platter. especially after finishing Volume 10, last 2 chapters, they gave us even more questions.  Most parts that need analyzing or understanding are Hachiman, Yukino and Hayama also Haruno.  The rest not so much."
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,KitKatxz,2,Tue Jun 2 05:53:07 2015 UTC,"What makes Oregairu a cut above the rest for me - and I'm a guy who doesn't like the LN format in general - is that it gives the readers/viewers/fans different ways to appreciate it. If you want to look deeper into it and analyze 8man's somewhat questionable philosophies then that's fine. If you're a guy who goes 'Yukino is best waifu!' that's fine too. The series panders to a lot of different 'cultures' . On the surface, it stands as a very good romcom anime or LN. There's nothing wrong in enjoying it that way. That said, there shouldn't be anything wrong with analyzing the eps and chaps the way those guys who write the essays do too, right?"
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,3,Tue Jun 2 06:12:17 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.... Warning slight spoilers below(Up to the lastest episode of S2)  Sometimes people go off on the simpliest of things, like Iroha's character is just meant there to progress the romantic part of the plot and be a worse Komachi,  yet people are writing paragraphs about her for some strange reason.  Then there are the good ones where they discuss theory crafting! Like why did Yukino want to become President,why does she acts the way she does, hachiman growth, and the last one i think of is what did Yukino want 8man to help her with and how their bond has grown enough for her to ask him. I'm not trying to be biased here by not mentioning Yui but her character is simple and very straight-foward so there's nothing to discuss much about her character(Maybe volume 11 may change this, who knows).  TL;DR  Bad example:Insert huge paragraph about Iroha running away crying.  Good example:Insert huge paragraph about hacihman's speech about wanting something genuine.  All and all, it's matter of opinion.  Edit:Grammar"
OreGairuSNAFU,386frj,manamono,3,Tue Jun 2 04:47:52 2015 UTC,"Sometimes people go off on the simpliest of things, like Iroha's character is just meant there to progress the romantic part of the plot and be a worse Komachi,  yet people are writing paragraphs about her for some strange reason.   Hey, hey, hey no need to talk about me like that. But I agree she is just a plot device  Also in the LN, their is a lot of sub text, and how Watari explains emotions of the characters can well be seen very well in the writing. For example the reactions 8man was having while talking to a certain someone (not Yukino for those who haven't read the LN) his reactions end being a tad weird near the end. I love the analyzing part, I can not recall a discussion was about, but it was covered in black boxes, and it was quite enjoyable. Talking to a few people about the LN is always nice and well relaxing, it isn't an argument of who is best girl. But a discussion of what could happen or what does this scene mean and so on.   Volume 10 spoilers  TL;DR: Analyzing is just fun to do with this series."

I suspect that the three memorandum chapters will be cut. I found that they were the most intriguing part of volume 10, but they'd be very difficult to animate, especially considering the ambiguity of the speakers. Nonetheless, the tie-ins with Dazai's works brought to light an interesting dimension of the text, one that I hope is returned to in the near future.  I'm, of course, looking forward to this. Not only will there be more lengthy discussion about my favorite character(!), but we'll also be getting volume 11 on the day of the final episode—which will hopefully clarify all that volume 10 left unturned.

Having the entirety of vol 10 condensed in just 2(?) eps? I feel S2 should end with 6.5 or just vol 9 since both have a satisfying end. Vol 10 feels different, and would be better appreciated if it were followed by something more, vol 11 content ideally. I also feel kind of sad they'll be cutting huge chunks of it but I guess there's no helping that... well, whatever, I'll still watch it anyway, but I won't be expecting much this time ( aside from the not-so-subtle 8man looking at Yukino scenes - if they do this right I'll be happy enough )"
OreGairuSNAFU,37szwq,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Sat May 30 10:56:38 2015 UTC,If you take out the Memorandums I think it's easily done in the episodes left. I get they are there but they are also anonymous to us readers so if they adapted that it would be a bit off. That's just my guess. If we assume that 3 episodes seems pretty nice for it. Although it makes me question IF the last episode will be some random episode like season 1. Different studios but it's possible which could kill the pace but until more info comes we'll see what happens.

It is nice to see someone explain these parts I was actually some what confused by them. You saw a lot in the subtext. So this is quite a possibility also, since it seems that Hayama and Yukino seem to share a displeasure with each other. I think the arranged marriage thing is a little off, since the boy/ and girl can reject the arrangement or reject the chosen. But this was discussed in another thread posted a while ago.  So short story, arranged marriage is a possibility but this right here seems more likely and more of Watari's style. But we will see in what in a month? I have to wait for translations T.T"

I don't think it is an arranged marriage but more like pressure for them to get married when they finish school. But I believe both of them are two afraid to speak against their parents and say no, they want happiness. So I really believe that 8man might effect both Hayama and Yukino letting them stand up to their parents and saying no.  So arranged marriage is possible, but more than likely it is pressure to get married. I would actually think Hayama would try to get Yukino to try and like him again, not ignore her."

I don't recall Yukino saying something about keeping 2 families together too, so it would be nice if you could point out where you got that from so that I can go and re-read haha. Though If I remember correctly, the idea of Hayama and Yukino being forced to marry each other was never mentioned anywhere in the LN.

Yukino was talking about the relationship of Hayato's and the Yukinoshita Family with Yui and 8man. And how her parents wanted to keep it going. But ended up saying their are other ways of keeping it together. Hachiman starts naming of possible ways in his head. I know it is in volume 10. It is a quite small part.   Yukinoshita’s answer sounded vague. Yuigahama and I looked at Yukinoshita to continue and with a preface, “It might be a contradiction, but” she said, “If he plans to continue our family relations in the near future, then I believe it would be much more efficient if he succeeded the law firm.” “Wouldn’t that mean he’ll be going with the liberal arts, then?” I said. Yukinoshita shook her head. “There are other ways to continue that relation, so…” Well, yeah. Not just lawyers, but other business conditions could be used to maintain a relationship. It didn’t even need to be from a business standpoint either. For example, a marital relationship, though it felt completely out of touch with reality, was one possibility that could be considered.   Yep misunderstood it."

Actually the fact that Hachiman mentioned it once there would serve as a pretty clever foreshadowing since it's pretty easy to not pay much attention to Hachiman's monologue and all.

The sexual molestation is practically irrelevant to the story except insofar as it suggests the main character's inexplicable appeal to women, so its likely not especially relevant to Oregairu.

In No Longer Human, the main character responds in existential terror to this - because he's successfully fooled everybody else he's ever met, but this mouth-breathing idiot child saw right through it on their first meeting.  I see an interesting point of contact to 8man's state of mind from 7-9.  He's pretty much been seen through, but for the first time he's starting to question whether the facade he puts up - being coolly aloof and happy as a loner - is really only for his own benefit, and whether its possible to put it aside and make himself vulnerable.  We know how that turned out; its a notable contrast from No Longer Human.  The main character basically makes himself a slave to his ""friendship"" with this drooling moron because he's so afraid that he might tell somebody else the truth about him.  So for me, the question I ask is: which of these characters is in a position to question the facade they put up, and not making 8man's choice?  Who is propping up a revolting, artificial relationship for the sake of protecting their own sense of self (or some other ego-centric stake)?  I haven't read Volume 10 in about a month so I'd have to go back to that for clues about who each section might have been talking about.  I think you're on the money with your analysis.  Just from what we saw in that book alone, it almost has to be talking about Hayama.  But who knows.  Haruno may have been one of the readers of Ningen Shikkaku as well.  Guess we'll see sooner or later."
OreGairuSNAFU,37syul,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Sat May 30 06:49:04 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't read No Longer Human (I read only the Wikipedia summary haha) so I really had no idea how each character's personality is specifically. That's why I'm really thankful of the insight you provided here. It's surprising that the schoolmate of him is an idiot as you said (which makes thing more complicated), though if we take that friend's idiocy into account (without any twist) I don't know if we can make a reference to anyone. It could represent the group he is currently in, but I doubt that group has seen through Hayama's true nature though. I don't know if at some point the MC in No Longer Human questioned the facade he puts up or not, but I don't seem to recall hachiman being completely seen through. Though again, as far as I saw in wikipedia, the facade was basically the tool to establish interpersonal relationship, so I ruled anyone that doesn't seem to relevant to this out first haha.   Still, if the MC in No Longer Human does question his own facade at some point after being seen through, it could be another supporting evidence for Hayama. You remind me of the scene where Hachiman questioned the superficial relationship Hayama tried to enjoy, and it's pretty likely that the words Hachiman said (""it's more absurd that you are trying to enjoy relationship like that"") made him question about his current situation as well.  Wow I think this totally makes sense. Hachiman could be considered the idiot (judging from outwards social standing alone, that is), which could refer to that idiot friend in No Longer Human. Also, if we consider the ""true self"" the MC tried to conceal to be Hayama group's real relationship and secrets, this will fit right into the lock: Hachiman pointing that true picture of their relationship out, Hayato asking Hachiman to prevent it from revealing, Hayato ending up (kinda) helping Hachiman in his own way (during Orimoto date), which also could match the definition of ""befriend"" as well.   So I think this really looks like a final interpretation for me, unless there are some other points in No Longer Human that could be taken. Thank you again socaiso!"
OreGairuSNAFU,37syul,paladinmahdi,1 point,Sat May 30 09:23:24 2015 UTC,"Hachiman could be considered the idiot   So people seem to think so. Like Iroha did in Volume 10, she apparently always questioned his intelligence. But found out he actually gets good grades well the liberal arts perspective but science he sucks in. So people who don't know him actually could see him as and idiot, because he seems like that guy who just doesn't do anything"
OreGairuSNAFU,37syul,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Sat May 30 22:21:13 2015 UTC,"Just a quick response because I'm tired, but the MC in No Longer Human does not question his facade.  He is fully committed to it and views its discovery as an existential threat.  He is genuinely sociopathic, which I don't think describes anybody in Oregairu.  Thanks for starting a cool thread!"
OreGairuSNAFU,37syul,paladinmahdi,2,Sun May 31 03:15:16 2015 UTC,"Well I thought he questioned his own facade because of what you told me up there haha:   So for me, the question I ask is: which of these characters is in a position to question the facade they put up, and not making 8man's choice? Who is propping up a revolting, artificial relationship for the sake of protecting their own sense of self (or some other ego-centric stake)?   That's why I tried to twist Hayato to question his own relationship. Though after I rewatch it, he said he didn't think of his current relationship as superficial. Nonetheless, that wouldn't affect much about the interpretation haha. I agree that noone in Oregairu seems to be sociopathic, so I think it's not the element that should be considered when making a reference. Though if we are talking about the reference of the facade being seen through when the owner doesn't want it seen, I couldn't think of any other events in the story that could fit more than this Tobe's confession plan."
OreGairuSNAFU,37syul,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Sun May 31 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry if it read that way.  I was talking specifically about Oregairu when I talked about characters questioning their own motivations, because (barring some unexpected plot twist), nobody in Oregairu is a bona fide sociopath.  Their motivations for doing the things they do are almost certainly not to cover up the fact that they're monstrously inhuman, so whether they're given the chance or forced to do a little bit of introspection, they at least have the capacity of making choices about the kind of person they want to be.  This is not the case for the MC in No Longer Human.  He has absolutely zero redeeming qualities as a human being.  In contrast to 8man, who superficially appears to be evil and detestable but is actually big-hearted and hugely sensitive to other people's needs, the MC of No Longer Human is supremely charming and can easily gain the trust of most people just on the appearance of goodness, but he is a true nihilist who lives for nothing and enriches the lives of nobody he meets.  There's no difference between life and death, service and selfishness.  One state of being is not only interchangeable from the other, but indistinguishable - life is suffering, pleasure is great while it lasts but ultimately leads to pain, etc.  He exists just to get along, futilely attempting to minimize trouble for himself but ultimately leaving ruined lives in his wake.  8man thinks this is the kind of person he is at the start of the series.  It'll be interesting to see how each of these characters compares themselves to this image.  Even if they don't match it perfectly, it doesn't mean you can't see something of yourself in a character like that.  For example, there are obvious parallels to 8man's stated philosophy from the beginning of the series; Hayama is very charming but fundamentally incapable of developing meaningful relationships (for reasons apparently outside his control), and so on."
OreGairuSNAFU,37syul,paladinmahdi,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:40:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you again for a very interesting insight. I could see from Wikipedia alone that this novel is extremely dark and frighteningly hopeless, that's why I tried to take things from a lighter perspective haha, and yes I don't believe any of them as inhumane at all, so to move on I need to ignore some insane perspective to be able to make some reference. Again, while I see some possibility of this to belong to Haruno and Hayama, I don't see much possibility that this would be Hachiman. The biggest reason I found is from the conversation with Haruno in the middle of the series:   “Hikigaya-kun, what’s your career path?” “Well, the liberal arts.” “Oh okay. You’re always reading books, after all. That’s our Literature Boy.” “Ahh, no, that’s… I guess.” It’s true that I was reading a book when I met Haruno-san before in the city. But I was only reading it because it was really awkward… It was just my book barrier of certain death. Due to how lame that reason was, I naturally averted my eyes from Haruno-san. But after Haruno-san took a half-step out in front, she leaned slightly forward and peered into my face. “What kind of books do you read?” “…Usually anything. I don’t read foreign ones though.” “Mmhmm. Then, how about Akutagawa or Daizai?” “For the most part, I’ve read them, but… I tend to read general literature more.” Quite frankly, I could enjoy things called literature if I decided to engross myself in it, but otherwise, the only worthless impressions coming out of me would be “Wow, that’s high literature for you! It isn’t famous for nothing! This is definitely an immortal work, so five stars!” On that point, entertaining works including light novels received plenty of flak, but they were still enjoyable even if the content wasn’t appealing, so light novels were the best! What’s with this terrible way of enjoying things…?   He reacts very lightly to the mention of Daizai, and doesn't appear to take novel much more than an enjoyment. Also, I couldn't think of Hachiman as someone who would get his true ugly self (?) dragged up from reading this literature as the memorandum mentioned, since his true self is as good as any other good people can be. Also, while it's true that he could be considered a nihilist, but this memorandum is in Volume 10 where he has gone through considerably change in his high school. And that's more of the reason that I don't believe he would try to find himself from this hopeless novel again. He doesn't have any serious problems at hands at that point anymore. So as you said, the MC is just a contrast of Hachiman, and the only way for hachiman to see himself in there would be seeing the MC as his contrast of his being, which I don't think that would give any negative vibes I could feel from the memorandum haha.  Sorry if I was wrong to take your clarification as the mention of possibility of Hachiman being an owner haha. I wholeheartedly respect your time to provide me the details of No Longer Human, and your insight is very sound as well. So as you said in your original comment above that though this memorandum will likely belong to Hayama, Haruno still remains as the possibility as well. Especially when I look at the negative aspects of MC's point of view you mentioned, she is as fit as Hayato as a person that is charming and minimize trouble for herself, and somehow more fitting if we talk about how she might perceive the world more negatively. She also mentioned Dazai to Hachiman after all.  Though I would say we know far too less about Haruno for her to fit as the owner of this memorandum. Whenever I try to make Haruno into this first memorandum's owner, I ended up with a lot of assumptions and speculations about Haruno more than I ever have with Hayama. For example, an assumption about her involvement with Yukino and Hayama's middle school conflict, her feeling of regret that we have never seen (since the memorandum started with the owner focusing at the sentence ""Mine has been a life of much shame.""), the reference that could be made to the 2nd memorandum of No Longer Human (We saw Hachiman seeing through her, but she didn't really seem to care at all), etc.  Or could it be that because we don't know enough about Haruno, this memorandum could fit as a memorandum even more? That would certainly be outside my capabilities haha.  To be honest, the part that makes me interested in First Memorandum more than the other two is that it's not very clear about who wrote it as the rest, and also it potentially holds the hints of what happened in the owner's past, and what might happen in the future. It's just a way of relieving the pain of waiting for the next volume haha. For example, I still don't get the question about why that person feels that he/she needs to know what will happen from there on in the book. Could it hold no value at all? That would be a little disappointing =3="

Creating a Season 3, adapting all further volumes, would give the anime series an actual conclusion, which is rare these days."

OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,asianedy,-1,Fri May 29 12:37:02 2015 UTC,"I decide to read again after last nights episode I actually have a idea why she meant what she meant on the train. Plus Iroha is in the story because she creates plot, but is an abomination of literature. She was introduced in a volume meant for fan service (wtf). I don't hate her because people ship her I hate her because she is an poorly designed character and the way she speaks is so stupid, like I want to shot her because it is that bad.   Okay as far as the train goes. Spoiler  Iroha is a terribly designed secondary character, to force a wedge into his friendships with yui and Yukino for the sake of plot. Which is okay, except people seem to over react to her cuteness (hahahaha she isn't cute) as romantic advances. She is their to make the plot interesting not become the part of the main plot the group of three people. She started off later in the series. Plus in Chapter 8, 8man basically explains why he dislikes her and sees her as a sister that is less cute then komachi and as evil as Haruno. And if you seriously either respond with incest is wincest bull crap or volume 10.5 is good. .5 volumes is fan service that does not apply to the plot what so ever and are never mentioned again (why couldn't this happen to iroha?). And I am not going to go into the other thing, just because you're and idiot if you believe that shite.  Here you go /u/asianedy  Editing and finding errors still also.  Also I see Irohafans as the 9gag of the Oregairu fan base."
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,4,Fri May 29 13:09:26 2015 UTC,"Poorly designed character? Oh, god...  See, most characters on this show can sort of fit a trope to a degree. Obviously, they're not as simple as your average romcom character, but were designed that way. Oregairu started as a light novel, and if Watari wanted to finish this story, he had to make some compromises in order to make the series popular enough.   So, we have Hachiman as the cynical mc. Yukino as the broken yamato nadeshiko. Yui as the innocent gyaru. Komachi as the supportive little sister. Zaimokusa as the delusional. Totsuka as the ""I can't believe it's not a girl!"". They were created with those stereotypes in mind, and then developed.  But, what is Iroha? Right from the start, Hachiman points out her act. She's not a cute underclassman. She's a selfish girl that uses her charm to get what she wants.  In any other anime/LN/manga, she would be called a bitch and be relegated to an antagonist role.  In the real world, she would be a girl. Period.  See, Iroha's the real thing. An actual human being. She's not a typical anime character, pure at heart, waiting to be saved by prince charming (aka, boring MC). She wants something, she does her best to get it. Of course, doing her best practically means playing the damsel in distress most of the time. And there's nothing wrong with it.  Troll addendum: She's the real thing. Ergo, she's genuine.  Disclaimer: I personally don't care about Hachiman's love life. He can marry whoever he wants, and ill be fine with it as long as the story ends up satisfactorily."
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,txchr15,1 point,Fri May 29 18:26:54 2015 UTC,As a late comer into the plot she still has a shot nonetheless. I mean we have the childhood friend trope where some other girl can just swoop in and nail the MC away. That's like 16 years of knowing each other blow off by someone who the MC knows for 6 months. You can apply this to the 6 months 8man has known yukino and yui to the 3 months or less of Iroha.
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,CrazystuffIsee,1 point,Fri May 29 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"She does have a shot, I agree. But I rather not see it as an extension of a trope, but something new. Iroha was introduced as a side character, fairly late. Yet somehow she's now a main character and even a potential partner.  One thing I like about oregairu is how it plays to be a conventional light novel before breaking those conventions.  Which is why I can't help but smile whenever someone states that Yukino will ""win"" because she was the first girl."
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,txchr15,2,Fri May 29 18:55:00 2015 UTC,Yukino has the greatest odds of winning because the story is largely focused on the relationship between 8man and Yukino. Every semi relevant character was designed to bridge them together in some form. This isnt waifu war related either but more from a story perspsective. I love Iroha but its pretty obvious what her character is designed to do: its to help break 8man's stance on girls and to be a catalyst to foster the relationship between the service club (and get the other girls jelly). She is able to navigate through 8man's shields/walls that he has when it comes to girls (poor Yui gets repelled almost every time whereas Yukino technically doesnt have any obstacle interestingly enough)  Also I disagree that Oregiaru breaks tropes. It doesnt. Watari might bend them a little but for the most part he hasnt subverted anything; its just way better executed than the typical romcom LN
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,Fruitsy,1 point,Fri May 29 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"""winning"".  I don't think this is a love story. Yui's feelings were shot down pretty early and Yukino's started fairly late. Iroha's on a worse spot because her highlight happens on a .5 volume. Not to mention, Haruno's final statement leaves Yukino's feelings to speculation. Is it really love? Aren't we misunderstanding?  Someone once described it as a ""coming of age story"", and that is what I see. Characters growing up. More specifically, Hachiman. It doesn't need a winner. Probably would be better without one, who knows?  That said, perhaps I am imposing my ideals on this novel, like hachiman would say. I mostly skim through RomComs, so my perception on tropes being broken is probably bad.  But I'm seriously hoping for an ending with substance. Hachiman realizing something as he steps into adulthood. Same for Yukino and Yui."
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,txchr15,2,Fri May 29 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"It is a love story? Maybe? It is a romcom at heart albeit one that is way more fleshed out and interesting. At the very least 8man will end the series knowing that he can be in a relationship with a girl even if it isnt a named character. Its his last hurdle as a character if we're being honest. Also I would take what Haruno says with a grain of salt.   I'm fine with a genuine friendship ending as well. To be honest, as long as the story ends well I dont really care who ""wins"". It could be Muira for all I know but if it feels natural then yeah go for it Watari.   That said, its hard for me to distance myself from the fact that at the end of the day, Oregairu is more about 8man and Yukino more than anything. Sure they dont have to end up together and thats perfectly fine but you'll be hard pressed to convince me otherswise that they've always been the focal point of the story. Other romcoms/harems introduce a myriad of girls that could potentially end up with the MC but Oregairu made it pretty clear from the start that Yukino would receive the most focus out of all the girls (she pretty clearly gets the most backstory out of any girl)"
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,Fruitsy,1 point,Fri May 29 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"Also I would take what Haruno says with a grain of salt.   But what is something worse than trust to Haruno, she is a demon lord after all."
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Sat May 30 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"This is what I really believe from reading the novels, Yukino without a doubt has more time than any other character next to 8man. Plus she seems to be the only one who she opens up to in a sense of being nice, maybe next to Yui. Plus the constant banter and teasing between is nothing but gold, also the ride and the end of volume 10 Spoiler"
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,-1,Sat May 30 01:16:36 2015 UTC,"Lol she is genuine? That cute exterior hides the ugly truth of her real personality. Which she revealed to hachiman. A cold calculating individual that uses her so called real personality to manipulate people such as 8man into doing stuff for her. This isn't a waifu war, this is a discussion about how bad of a character Iroha is. Just as I said Hachiman sees her as Haruno (a demon) and komachi(less cute), I she her as a female Hayato. She maybe be nice on the outside but if you tempt her she shows her ugly side. So how in the fact is she genuine when she has a fake personality? So far no one in this show is *genuine * they all have their fake personalities. Yukino with her fake cold exterior, Hayato with his fake good guy exterior, 8man with his loner exterior. This show is basically finding out who you really are on the inside and what you can do to fix that.  Obviously 8man, Yukino, and Yui are all helping each other get through this. Where iroha is driving a wedge between that. Hachiman and Yukino find her annoying as all hell (thank god) because she slacks off in their club. Trying to force them to do more stuff for the student council, thank good hachiman is smart enough to realize and refuses.  But oh wait their is more! Volume 10 it is like she is a secondary character, she only gets involved when a plot needs to happen. What is that called? Oh yes supporting actor. I am actually literally tired of this iroha best waifu. Because first support actors don't get the main protagonist, second then other two MC of this story do. But I don't care about I am just pointing out role positions.   Once again you seriously think she is genuine? (Lol) Please explain again why her fake cute personality is real? Because man I don't see it. She is a manipulative annoying little girl. No Iroha does not have a shot because once again she is a supporting actor not a MC. Yui has a better chance (lol). I am just glad most of the community realizes either Yukino will win or Yukino is best girl. ( fuck it I'm going to ship it. )"
OreGairuSNAFU,37pkwj,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Fri May 29 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"Hence why I put ""troll addendum"" there. Just a silly play on words, nothing more. No need to call me o it repeatedly, mate.  First, you said, and I quote ""poorly designed character"". Which she isn't. You consider her bad? Fine by me. But she isn't poorly designed. If anything, she's pretty unique among the millions of ""pure maidens"" on anime.  Hayato acts nice because that's what everybody expects of him. Iroha's nice because she wants to be seen as a nice girl. So, I would disagree on her being a female hayato. As for mini Haruno... Well, Iroha certainly looks up to Haruno. After all, Haruno has ""mastered"" her façade, unlike Iroha.  About the spoiler... Whose fault is that anyway? Hachiman convinced a freshman with no experience on student council work to go with it. He may have tried to dodge the bullet by telling her to call Hayato, but sadly, he's seen as more reliable by her. Not o mention, the service club did an outstanding job with the cultural festival planning. Why not call them again?  Can't argue about iroha being a secondary character. I see where you are coming from, but to me (and a fairly large bunch of viewers), she's a main. When feel presented designs, she was there. Teaser posters? Yup, iroha's there. Kinda like how the Green Ranger appeared late, yet is still a main character.  As I stated, I care not for who ""wins"" (though I would believe Yui is the more adequate for a plethora of reasons). I never went ""omg, iroha best girl"". I merely pointed why she's a great character."

So you're fine and I apologize for any way I insulted you.   Iroha is my eyes will remain a none existent character only for plot and no one can convince me other wise.  Also the green power ranger was a good reference, I still can not see her as a main character this is a story of the service club not the service club +1"

OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,Sttaner1907,8,Thu May 28 01:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yukino definitely has something for 8man. If she just held him on a pedestal and nothing more, she wouldn't have done what she has so far. Much less some of the moments where she's quiet which can be perceived as jealousy. It's just a matter of them coming out and stepping over their borders for one another. 8man isn't willing to do that yet.   As for helping her, I feel like everything for the next volume is going to set up a similar scenario as her past. You have most likely her family coming into light as well as the valentine arc.....which will come out burning. If we are to see 8man save Yukino, I want to assume that Yui will start to turn on her. She's a nice girl but she can act when she isn't needed. Example was when 8man told her to stop pitying him and then overreacted thinking that Yukino and 8man were a couple. More than likely going to leave for good. So we set up the situation where the people took her shoes. Now we introduce her family issues where 8man can clearly see what the issue are.   There's a lot of speculation about Hayama and Yukino in some arranged marriage or something similar. I can see it happening but it seems rather strange to me since I'm not familiar with this part of the culture. The dad seems pretty chill enough to let her stay in her own while her mom is some scary personality. So for an arranged marriage I would assume the father has to set it up and not her mom. Especially when it's her dad's work and no her mom's. However let's assume this is true then it's just a matter of Hikki helping her which more than likely means taking her as his own.   As of right now it's just speculation since they don't press for details on personal problems."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,3,Thu May 28 03:24:01 2015 UTC,"I thank you deeply for that insightful answer :) I really apreciate it.   The last time i loved a series that much was white album 2, but its my first time ever reading a LN. I really hope the author keeps up the good work! and huge credits to the translators.  Now i cant remeber quite but i disagree with hayama and yukino beeing in some arranged marriage. Hayama said he likes a girl which name starts with ""Y"". i first thought about yukino but after some time reading i start to think that he likes yukinos sister.  I totally agree tho with Yui to leave the club someday. I think that she will betray yukinon somehow involving 8man, leaving yui with a bad ending. either that OR it will go full white album 2 with setsuna beeing yui. well just speculating :) thats what makes it the most fun not knowing what will happen."

I get bored at work, read before bedtime, and in my spare time so I read them, I always get enjoyment out of it. 8man will forever be my favorite protagonist."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,2,Thu May 28 04:50:19 2015 UTC,"The arranged marriage was completely debunked since the other comment said the girl needs to show consent in which case, she more than likely won't. I can keep it in mind since it's still a possible plot point used in stories but it isn't a very good theory.  Hayama's stating the girl starting with a ""Y"" can mean either sister really. I want to also say it's Haruno yet why would he feel inferior to 8man? Haruno can't have a romantic interest in 8man given what she sees between 8man and Yukino. You could argue that Hayama is envying how 8man is able to do something but he isn't really clearly showing everything so I'm not going to debunk it just yet.   Yui will start off bad but if 8man is to save Yukino, he has to patch up the relationship with Yui so there isn't a bad ending in the sense where she's gone for good with any type of relationship. She left the club temporarily for 8man saying not to pity him. So in order to show her growth as a character she will have to show acceptance to any situation and not taking it too far where her actions are like lies.  I haven't watched White album to get the reference."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,socalso,2,Thu May 28 04:37:02 2015 UTC,"Chiming in in defense of my theory here - how does that debunk anything?  Yukino is bound by expectation and is constantly getting pushed into doing things she doesn't want to do by her family - we see this a ton of times by her sister in the first 9 volumes and Spoiler.  If they decided for her who she should marry, and she lacks the ability to say ""no"" to that on her own, then she's in a pretty tight spot.  People routinely offer their legal consent to situations they don't want to assent to, but feel compelled to for whatever reasons.  I ""consent"" to paying taxes and jury duty because I lack the will to accept the consequences of resistance.  No law has been broken in the constraining of my will here (except maybe God's law, but that's neither here nor there).  Likewise with such an arranged marriage.  Neither party could be ""coerced"" into going through with it in the strictest legal definition, but that wouldn't mean they weren't being compelled by the weight of social expectation, the probability of strained or even severed family ties, simple disappointment of loved ones, and so on.  Speaking for myself, I was never under the delusion that such an arranged marriage would be some kind of legally binding contract and I don't know anybody else who made that argument.  This series runs on the problems people cause each other with their unrealistic/unfair expectations of each other - it would cheapen the drama for it to be some kind of plot-convenient contrivance like that they're being forced into it legally.  It would be bad enough just to have that expectation foisted on them, having too much loyalty to family/decorum to refuse out of hand.  Where I saw this as being a likely plot development was largely in this scene here.  Please help me someday.  Obviously she's not asking 8man for help in disentangling a legally binding contract - that would be absurd.  ""Help"" could mean as ""little"" as supporting her decision to walk away from her family altogether.  We know that Hayama is envious of 8man's ability to tell social conventions to take a hike and that he resents his own lack of choice in life - because he is loyal to a fault to his family's will.  He won't resist his family, and she isn't strong enough to do it on her own. That's what I and the handful of others who thought the idea had some legs saw in it.  I never even saw the conversation where people were making the assumption about lack of consent being an issue and it wouldn't have occurred to me to consider it, because, as you rightly say, it wouldn't fit into the story as its been written up til now."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,2,Thu May 28 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't Haruno be the main person to use first? Consider how these marriages work you tend to go with the first daughter. But I guess you can say Yukino is a treasure daughter so she's ""expendable."" Social expectations I would think it's something different than a marriage since she's able to voice her opinion. How else was she able to get her own apartment despite the family issues. So at some point, at the lowest points, she will come out and just disapprove despite what some might assume.   Your second paragraph is a perfect explanation that I agree and couldn't think of. The only reason it's brought up is Yukino is from a rich family and Hayama has family ties with her. This can lead to this problem but definitely doesn't fit the story.  Her request could go either by support or just changing the situation. I tend to lead towards full change. Now I guess I probably pulled out the arranged marriage because it's plausible with the family ties. Which I've read different forums and thought about the ideas they bring up. There isn't anything concrete to make it go away. I can agree with helping her being strong against her family but it could be different meanings like when I pointed out getting pass the social issues using Yui's potential betrayal. We only know that her family and past were problems. And her past doesn't necessarily show up but it shapes who she is now.  I can only speak from a different asian lineage living in america is how the parents are ruthless comparing you to people who are better and constantly making decisions for you even though you're trying to do it. Consent is probably one of good words to sum it up. Now in japan I can assume these people can be use to it but at some point it has to go over the norm. So with this in my mind I looked at Yukino as possibly dealing with this sort of issue especially coming from a rich family. She doesn't hate them but she doesn't like the conduct that happens."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,socalso,2,Thu May 28 20:29:30 2015 UTC,"That's a point I talked about in the original thread but the short of it is that Haruno was chosen to be the family heir and is basically in a position to only ever marry downward, not upward or even laterally (unless she literally marries into the royal family, and even then, who knows if that would be something the Yukinoshita family would aspire to?).  That is, her future husband has to be somebody who will marry into the Yukinoshita family, not the other way around.  Hayama is also poised to take up one of the family businesses at this point (we don't know which but volume 10 hints that this is his driving motivation), so he isn't going to marry into another family.  That leaves Yukino - the lesser daughter, the one who was not chosen to be heir.  Aristocrats and oligarchs have always married off their extra children to secure alliances, and we know the Yukinoshita and Hayama families are ""old friends.""  As for the apartment, that's the one time we've seen her defy the will of her family, and then, it was a case of pitting her father against her mother.  In every other situation that we're aware of, she has demonstrated a total incapability of resisting their will.  It's only a theory though, and frankly, its probably truer as an abstraction that she wants his help to effect some kind of character change in herself, as you suggest.  The plot details, whatever they may be, are almost incidental to the underlying thematic issues.  Your last paragraph is interesting to me, because it's something I sometimes think about - I'm an American born-and-bred and I know I don't always have access to the full picture when it comes to cultural elements.  Even having lived in Japan for a while, I know there's things I still don't get without somebody explaining them to me - nevermind differences in law"
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,2,Thu May 28 20:46:13 2015 UTC,"I made a play with words on Yukino so I said ""at the lowest point"" she will object. Which only means the apartment but who knows I might be off there. You make it clear how the marriage is still on the table because the entire marriage process is just strange because 'murica, where these things are rarer.  It's just whether we can know more of Haruno's situation. We can only guess she's the one questioning whether there is such a thing as something genuine in volume 10. If this is true I don't think she had anything arranged to begin with. There just isn't enough until we enter volume 11 realm. Even then it won't answer us anything since it's most likely a set up volume.   I don't understand most of the culture but I just go around it with assumptions off of possible reasoning to why they act that way. Or common topics used in their stories. (obvious some are just stretched out) Worse case for me is to find key words of how I interpret the interaction and look it up. I just find that with or without culture, the feelings are somewhat the same."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,socalso,2,Thu May 28 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, again, we're on the same page with that - until Volume 11 (and 12, and so on) starts bringing some of these background elements to the fore, we're only speculating at this point.  I could be wrong about everything, except for understanding of their characters.  I think the author's done a great job of establishing character in his series to the point that we can all talk pretty confidently about that aspect without needing to know all the information that hasn't been revealed yet.  Good point - culture matters but enough things are universal that you don't need a degree in Japanese anthropology to figure out things like motivation."

Maybe that is what she is asking for 8man to help/ save her. 8man has the power to change people if you havn't noticed. Look at Hayato, he seems to be the only person to bring out his dark side, plus for Yukino that cold exterior seems to melt away when she is around 8man. But of course volume 11 is going to be the volume more than likely we find out what happens. It is the Valentine's Day arc so ships will burn or grow we will see. I just hope 8man can save the day and be the knight that he truly always been to Yukino, he must save his Angel. Also that rumor that went around in Volume 10 seemed weird, both Hayato and Yukino seemed strange about it, Yukino and Haruno both said "" It is nothing compared to that time "", the fuck does that mean? It does seem to be hinting at it. But it is also hinting a lot that Yukino is growing closer to 8man, also it kind of hinted that Hayato and Haruno both see it. So once again that is a possibility because they will try and sink that ship, unless 8man tends to step in."

The way I took it was that, during her childhood, Yukinon was bullied / harassed for her relationship with Hayama. It's possible that they were once friends / may have had feelings for each other, but, because Hayama is so popular, the people around Yukinon probably acted spiteful, hateful, and jealous towards her. This would lead to the current state of their relationship where Yukinon looks at Hayama coldly. Additionally, this could explain why Yukinon hates chain mail so much, and it's shown numerous times that she had a painful childhood."

Now I do think Hayama has a think for Yukino but can't get out of his status quo. Some can argue his ""Y"" hint can mean Haruno but he acts pretty cold to 8man. Which may not be entirely to the way he is. We don't know for sure since he's not an open book with his actions.  Also they were together trying to survive the demon that is Haruno so the 180 attitude has to be what you described above."

OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Thu May 28 06:39:58 2015 UTC,I have thought about this for a long time. I also think Hayama is interested in Haruno. Not the other way around. I suppose I can get on my computer and discuss it.
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,1 point,Thu May 28 12:30:58 2015 UTC,"I'll work from the bottom up since the bottom makes sense then we can work to why Hayama acts true to 8man  Given the timing of Haruno's line it could be as you said. But I think it could also mean he chose the status quo rather than protecting her. I get it can also mean something like him going for Haruno but I think Hayama knows Haruno's true personality to feel a bit of anger towards her (it was when Haruno talks about the past he had something I think) to go to her. As for Hayama doing things immediately for Haruno, 8man did it himself being scared of what she can do. So with family ties you can also argue that he can't avoid them so easily and got use to it. It's ambiguous so I'm not going to say you're wrong because it could still have multiple meanings. However we'll go off what I think.   When we bring up the cold personality towards 8man, I don't think he cares of what others see his true self. Why just 8man who sees the other side? 8man usually talked about how nice of a guy he showed himself to be. Even now still complimenting it a bit meaning he doesn't have a full grasp of the facade as we think he might. Now if everyone thinks he's a nice guy,why not show that more often to people outside of his cliche. I think there's a motive to showing 8man because of some inferiority as stated in their most recent talk. If we are to assume he's into Haruno why would he have a motive to act this way when Haruno has no romantic interest in 8man. She just finds him interesting and Hayama even gave him a warning how she can kill something if it isn't interesting to her. It just seems weird in general given how much time Haruno's been with 8man to have romantic interest.   I think it's a coin flip between both sisters. We can argue Haruno is golden child so she's generally chosen. Then we can argue it's Yukino, because she once was close with Hayama."

Why just 8man who sees the other side?   I think the main reason that he cares so much about Hikki seeing his true side is because of the way he views other people. As seen from his interactions with Irohas, Hikki sees through her deception and comes to be familiar with the 'true Irohas.' Additionally, Hayama even notices this when they go on that double date and points out that even Irohas shows Hikki her true side.  Hayama's true side definitely is not that of a genuinely, constantly nice person. While in S1, he is mainly seen as a foil who just wants to resolve conflict, S2 sheds some light on his non-nice side. I can say without a doubt that the Hayama shown in S1 would not have pulled the stunt that he did with Orimoto and her friend. Additionally, in one of the more recent episodes, Hayama blatantly tells Hikki that he's a much nicer person than he himself is.  This is just my perspective on why Hayama really wants Hikki to see his true nature."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,1 point,Thu May 28 17:11:05 2015 UTC,I guess I'm forgetting the fact that he even confronted him during the events with Sagami. It's just hard for me to grasp the idea because of how little we base off the interactions. I don't think a unique view point can be the only reason for the sudden drastic change in attitude shown. Much less to be constantly watching 8man to understand what his tendencies would be like. Unless the Summer camp was enough for him to understand.   It's no secret he feels inferior to 8man. And to that it comes back to his jealousy of either romantic interest or unable to do the same things as 8man.
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,AeroSkyline,1 point,Thu May 28 22:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that definitely makes sense. Whether it be the success of the things that Hikki does or his 'true' relationships with his friends, Hayama seems to feel inferior towards the 8man.  While the Sagami scene forces Hayama to realize that Hikki's methods are nearly always social suicide, I don't think the focus during that scene was on his development. In my opinion, the impact of that scene is used to contrast when Yukinon sees Hikki committing social suicide in person (when he asks out Ebina) to show how, even though Yukinon largely respected Hikki's reputation for success, when she actually sees how he deals with problems in person, she can't stand seeing him suffer.   tl;dr for paragraph 2, I think the Sagami scene was used as a foil to show how much Yukinon cares for Hikki."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,1 point,Thu May 28 23:01:08 2015 UTC,I don't think we need to deviate the Sagami events as it served multiple purposes. Hayama will usually be involved in the secondary meanings until he gets tackled with it directly. It's no doubt that the Sagami events lead up to Yukino's realization but when discussing Hayama's POV we have to look at his interactions alone. In that moment he knew 8man well enough to comment why it's the only thing he can do.
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,AeroSkyline,1 point,Thu May 28 23:12:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose you're right. In your opinion, why do you think that Hayama cares so much about Hikki being treated right? Hayama is always standing up for Hikki, even though he sees how Hikki's actions cause himself (and sometimes others) to feel down. I was thinking along the lines that Hayama sees how truly nice Hikki is and doesn't want people to misunderstand his actions, no matter how ruthless they may be.  Thoughts?"

OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,1 point,Fri May 29 00:17:09 2015 UTC,The counter point is how much he knows about Haruno's behavior. He knows what can interest her and what she can smother to death. So I don't think he can be that jealous of the attention. Much less I think the inferiority was built over time and Haruno hasn't been there in all the events that have happened. So it's unlikely haruno is the reason for the inferiority.

I spent time reading up on Japanese Culture, and this was one thing that came up. Aparently is is called Miai. But I do believe this might be a possibility, she doesn't really hate her family more or less dislikes them. I really want to know why.   Yukino definitely has something for 8man. If she just held him on a pedestal and nothing more, she wouldn't have done what she has so far. Much less some of the moments where she's quiet which can be perceived as jealousy. It's just a matter of them coming out and stepping over their borders for one another. 8man isn't willing to do that yet.   As for this yes and totally yes. I tend to over react sometimes. So my explanation was a bit biased.   As for helping her, I feel like everything for the next volume is going to set up a similar scenario as her past.   This also is wonderful explanation of how I feel the next Volume will be about. She seems to be trusting 8man a little more."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,2,Sat May 30 07:29:25 2015 UTC,Ah okay so the arranged marriage shouldn't be in the picture if she needs a say in it. So her problems are still vague since all we've seen of her is mostly outside of her classroom or normal environment in which people can turn on her. Maybe using her so much more like a collection as opposed to an actual daughter? I mean it's been emphasized how she has been in Haruno's shadows.
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Thu May 28 03:42:23 2015 UTC,"But in Volume 10  So to me the next Volume is questionable, it might have to do with Yukino revealing her past and something to do with Yui. Plus valentine arc, prepare to go down with your ships because I am going down with Yukino's ship ( I highly doubt it will go down but that we will see. A lot of people seem to agree I mean a lot of people, that the story is just how 8man meet Yukino and how their relationship seemed to blossom slowly. Kind of like of How I meet your Mother type of thing   Volume 10 again"

OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Thu May 28 04:14:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe it is because Yukino, wants to be praised as much as Haruno is? But Haruno cute out shell is well an illusion, 8man says so himself Spoiler Where technically Yukino is the opposite of her siste (A cold exterior, and a cute interior). Which to me makes no sense why she would want to follow her sister. Also Yukino has something Haruno doesn't, friends and possibly a romantic attraction towards someone. But we probably won't find out till Volume 11, the wait is to long then I have to wait for a translations to happen T.T."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,2,Thu May 28 04:19:49 2015 UTC,"Following her sister might be so she's more recognized if we say they gave Haruno the special treatment but when I think about my own speculation. I'm not sure if it aligns with the mom's intentions with what we know. The dad seems to be the level headed one so far. I'm still kind of thinking about it but I need to look up evidence when I reread the chapters on my bus rides.   Also something about what you said   Also Yukino has something Haruno doesn't, friends and possibly a romantic attraction towards someone   This is somewhat interesting on it's own because if we were to attach the memorandum about whether there is such a thing as something genuine. We can probably speculate how many people tried to get to close to her then ultimately going away.   SO MUCH SPECULATING I LOVE IT  Volume 11 is going to be hell of a wait. There's the release then trying to dig through the internet for some plot points. Then hyping for Sypro to finish chapter 1. God I don't think I can handle it well once I know it's been physically released in Japan. Even then Volume 11 might just be the beginning of the problems much like how volume 7 has problems through volume 9 ; - ; I feel for Yuifags"
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Thu May 28 04:35:58 2015 UTC,"I feel for Yuifags   Me to, the poor guys  Major Spoilers (This is all speculation, and stuff I have gathered for reading)  So speculations for Volume 11. Ships will burn, 8man becomes to understand emotions more, Yukino opens up about her family, the damn valentine arc is to happen, and something happens to Yui does she betray Yukino or does she help her?"
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,CrazystuffIsee,2,Thu May 28 04:46:04 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try to answer what i can from what you typed since it's not broken up and it's late at night. So I apologize if I didn't hit everything.   Also I think this thread is suppose to have a spoiler tag if we're going to refer to Yukino's actions towards 8man. Trying to put up a reason since I had to read your spoiler off the source.     Yukino should have romantic feelings as I stated before because if she didn't why would she act the way she has instead of just admiring him and acting close to one another in a friendly way rather than implying some romance. Such as physical contact, in a subtle way rather than deliberate like a pat on the back. Overall Yukino has changed towards 8man but doesn't want others to know. I mean even as far back as volume 7, I think her roommates pressed the issue on her causing her to leave. Rather than just ""why are you able to get along with a guy like him?"" there might be ""Is there something between you two?"" I bring this up given the vague wording of her explanation and the events in volume 6 where they were together. I also can bring up in volume 7, she is able to defend him and criticize his methods in one description so I don't think there is a problem explaining who is 8man.  8man probably doesn't fully understand his feelings either but at the same time I think he's too perceptive to miss that. I think he's just no open to the relationship since it's not in line with how he thinks. Wasn't volume 7 also when he turned down Yui's advances to confess. I just don't think he can miss it entirely.   There is also the times where he does things to make her silent. A good example I can remember is in the events of chapter 4 volume 10. Iroha asks if there is anyone that 8man is seeing. The way she asks and makes 8man a bit flustered made both Yui and Yukino silent. You could imagine their faces like (e . e). Another time being when they found out 8man took a picture with Iroha. The talking all of a sudden goes quiet. I think in both cases 8man notes how cold it is as if it were some cold wrath which is usually associated with yukino since she is known as the ice princess (or whatever title with ice)     Saving her from her outer shell seems to be a good idea. I'm just not completely sure if that should be the true goal since opening up to more people outside the club could lead to some problems. I get that she can learn but people can be jealous of her status and it just leads to problems of fake personalities. I mean the way you treat classmates/co-workers will be different to close friends and relatives. I think that she just needs to open more to friends namely Yui. I get she accepts Yui but interacting the way she does with 8man might be the alternate step to her growth. I think this idea is great but I'm rather lost on the ice cold personality on the changes that could happen outside of the club.     Yui saw enough to at least see the part where they break out of their usual bantering. Had she only seen the bantering, she would have entered right away. I mean at the beginning calling him like a bacteria is what she's done in the past. However the only difference to make Yui feel awkward is seeing 8man step out of expectations and ask for yukino's  career path. That's going to prelude to the inevitable events of volume 11. There isn't much more we can add if we can't see what the event is like and the planning that goes into it. 8man helping yukino will have to mean they might reenact Yukino's past experiences. Other girls were jealous of her relationship with Hayama. Now this time it's 8man.     Volume 11- I agree with 8man and Yukino's development but Yui I'm leaning towards betrayal then redemption. She's the type to act like nothing happened at all if it's unfavorable to her. So she is likely to leave Yukino alone since her main goal was to get 8man. To show growth she will have to change herself and improve Yukino's views of her past."

OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,socalso,2,Thu May 28 20:13:40 2015 UTC,"I responded to this point above, but bear in mind that just because she's legally able to deny the marriage doesn't mean she has the will to do so.  Families bring a lot of pressures to bear that don't necessarily have the weight of law behind them.  We've seen Haruno push Yukino's buttons and get her to do things we know she doesn't want to do.  For all her strengths, Yukino has a glaring lack of willpower when it comes to her family.  We know she's resisted her mother's will exactly once in her life and that was in asking her father for permission to live on her own in high school."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Thu May 28 08:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yes makes sense, even in Volume 10, but to be honest this might have to do with the ""Help me Someday, okay"". Maybe 8man will give her the courage to speak up who knows. This might be a plot in the next volume or it couldn't. But it is also speculated that Hayato likes Haruno not Yukino. Where when it comes to arranged marriage it is customs only between 22 and 30. But legal marriage age in Japan is 16. But Haruno obviously has no interest in any form of relationships, she really likes to just fuck with people. But we also know that she doesn't hate her family, she sent them gifts in what volume 8? The ebina arc or whatever it was called when Tobe wanted to confess to ebina. She doesn't hate her family just dislikes certain aspect of her family, it just seems like one of those families that is just FUBAR. She probably sees an escape in Yui and 8man, and will probably get the courage from them. Because Yui and 8man are beginning to speak out, so it is a possibility."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,socalso,2,Thu May 28 20:21:55 2015 UTC,"That's actually an interesting point you raised, the presents she sent home to her family.  According to Haruno, Yukino does hate her family - but, perversely, she doesn't want to be hated by them.  She's bound by the weight of social expectation to do something artificial - sending souvenirs with no heart or feeling behind them - which she absolutely hates doing, but will do because she lacks willpower to rock the boat.  This is the same thing that happened in the Service Club over the last couple episodes.  She felt that the club's relationship was basically destroyed by Yui and 8man's choice to prevent her from taking up the presidency.  She interpreted that (not incorrectly) as a sign of their lack of faith in their relationship.  But even if the relationship was a lie, the club as an institution still existed - she felt compelled to keep up the pretense of ""business as usual"" even though her heart wasn't in it anymore.  It's why she didn't simply disband the club or kick 8man out of it - because she didn't want them to hate her (and because true friendship/true love, but they weren't honest enough with their feelings until last episode to even begin to articulate that), even if she ""hated"" what they had become.  As for Haruno, that's a head-scratcher.  Who knows where she really stands?  I would have said at the end of Volume 6 that she was like 8man in making herself a villain to spur Yukino's growth, but the things she does seem to be sadistic simply for the sake of fucking with Yukino and Hayama sometimes.  Nevermind what she really thinks of 8man.  The end of Volume 10 is pretty sinister."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Thu May 28 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"The end of Volume 10 is pretty sinister.   Sorry Spoilers But as the willpower as I said, she will probably learn to release the restraints and be able to push herself from the help of her friends, she seems to do a better job and relaxing around 8man than Yui, but that is a matter of speculations again."
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,ImAlAl,5,Thu May 28 20:55:02 2015 UTC,Well 8man is Yukinon's Dark Knight so yeah she has feelings

OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,guyofred,2,Thu May 28 08:47:33 2015 UTC,I don't think it was ever thoroughly explained. My guess is that it has something to do with the Yukinoshitas and the Hayamas family ties. We'll find out volume 11 I hope.
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,2,Thu May 28 20:15:44 2015 UTC,This is a Possibility also. I can not wait for Volume 11.
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Thu May 28 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"Let's first look for the true meaning of that sentence: Save/Help are written in the same way in Japanese language. Therefore, what Yukino most likely meant was Help me instead of Save me.  It goes back to that chapter/episode where Hachiman and Yui went to visit her. Yukino acts in a very professional way, thus, she doesn't open herself to other people and tries to be completely independable. This has been deconstructed constantly as Yukino begins to rely on Hachiman to solve the problems of the Service Club, though, last arc she decides she couldn't leave it to him anymore since his methods are cruel and don't really help anyone neither solves the problem.  But after Hachiman accepts that he was in the wrong and decides to stop solving things in that cruel way, you could say he gained Yukino's trust again. Now that the Service Club is back together, Yukino finds no problem in relying on Hachiman to help her as she once said she would in the future. And that future is now."

It's just an emphasis of the word usage given how we've used it before. Saving her from a family or helping her from family can be the same thing.   However they also used ""saved"" when mentioning Rumi. Which also seems like it should have been ""helped"""
OreGairuSNAFU,37jeso,LadWatcherIsHere,3,Thu May 28 15:53:32 2015 UTC,"I felt like OP was surprised because he thought Yukino meant that she was in trouble and needed to be saved.  I think there is a difference since that's one of Yukino's ideals: She doesn't save people from troubles. She helps them to deal with their troubles themselves.  I don't think Yukino meant that she was a hopeless princess in need of a charming prince who needs to be saved. Instead, she wants Hachiman to be there for her in case she needs someone to rely on from time to time."

OreGairuSNAFU,37mar4,CrazystuffIsee,2,Thu May 28 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry true, I just get salty. But Yukino and Yui have been around since volume 1 where iroha was introduced in volume 7.5 she for the sake of plot is a driving wedge between 8man and his friends. She does nothing else, and is possibly one of the most annoying characters in the LN I read her text when she talks and I want to blow her brains out. But it is a matter of opinion I can not stand this character on bit, when she was introduced it was an abomination of story telling and I know you are not on her ship. Plus I don't hate her because people ship her, she is just a terrible character in general."
OreGairuSNAFU,37mar4,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,3,Thu May 28 19:50:59 2015 UTC,"I can see your view. She's pretty much pushing herself through for her own needs. I mean she's like the mini devil of Haruno except it's not ""evil"" (might be a strong word) on the grand scale. It's like how the childhood friend trope. They tend to lose to a girl who suddenly shows up in the MC's life. (not suppose to be an argument for Iroha but rather an example of how a late character can still be in it)   When you mentioning plot device. Isn't Yui a subtle plot device? Essentially Yukino and 8man wouldn't ever come this close had she never step out of her way to keep things together. So I think plot device is a weird argument since we can say that about most things.   I like Iroha because you can tell she's hiding something but she's so sly that it makes it interesting."
OreGairuSNAFU,37mar4,CrazystuffIsee,3,Thu May 28 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"I like Iroha because you can tell she's hiding something but she's so sly that it makes it interesting.

As I see it, I can not get attached to characters who try and be cute. Yui herself is just cute, Yukino when not hiding behind that cold exterior is cute. Where Haruno and Iroha hide behind their cute exterior hiding something much worse. I just don't understand how she was implemented into the story when she was introduced in 7.5 where the .5 volumes are either fan service or either random side stories that are never brought up again. They have no point in the advancing the current plot what so ever.  Also /u/CrazystuffIsee thank you for dealing with my saltiness.

I mean if volume 10 chapter 4 has told us anything. She can just step up causing the other 2 to eye ball her like a nuisance. Without her I'm going to go out a whim and say 8man would talk at most for a total of 10 minutes before reading his book most of the time. He's not going to interact as much unless something happens. We're presented the times when there are things to do but I don't believe for a second that he would be able to talk to them constantly. Watari is on a lazy writing boat in the sense that he needed events that the Service club could do that hit all the points he wants to hit. Iroha just somehow makes that happen given her excuses to come to the service club. Hell even Volume 11 involves this exact premise. what is that, about 4 times now?   Downvotes always happen. I just ignore it because this is a forum and discussion. They're just immature to just make us care about internet points."

OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,asianedy,18,Tue May 26 02:21:43 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, Kaiki. Truly a god amongst men. Anyways I'm not good at putting my thoughts on paper so bear with me here.    The pen is mightier than the sword  Actions speak louder than words   These two quotes contradict each other but are right in their own ways.  First off what is the genuine thing Hachiman longs for? Well he wants a genuine relationship with Yui and Yukino but what exactly is a genuine relationship? Let's look at Hayama's group that Hachiman is disgusted by. He's not disgusted by the people themselves but how they're just acting out they would ""normally"" be as if everything were alright even if it weren't. And it wasn't. The club was in the same state as that but the club was the on the verge of breaking up while Hayama's group (seemingly) wasn't. The people in Hayama's group like the way it was and want to preserve it while the Service Club, mainly Yukinoshota, hates it yet they continue the charade. So once again what is a genuine relationship? It's to my understanding that it's one where they don't lie to each other by hiding behind a facade. Hayama hides behind his to live up people's expectations and preserve the status quo of the group. The real Hayama is ugly. Really, once you strip everyone of their facades they're ugly but should that matter? Could such a relationship based on that even exist? What Kaiki said was that in an attempt to become real, the fake things becomes worth more. (I paraphrased since I haven't read this series since forever but whatever.) The key parts being ""in an attempt"" and ""worth more."" Not necessarily more real but worth more. But even if it's worth less or worthless that's fine. Hachiman doesn't want the overly saccharine grape, he wants the real one. Even if it's bitter, poisonous, non existent, or worthless he still wants it. Hayama's group doesn't even try to be genuine.  Your example fits Hayama and Hachiman perfectly. Hayama acts like a good guy always living up to his high expectations and bring nice to everyone. That of course is all a charade and the real Hayama isn't ""as nice of a person [we] think he is."" While Hikki acts like a dick and overall unsociable he's nice deep down and wants to help everyone. So which is worth more? Hayama of course and Hachiman knows that. What Hachiman wants is a relationship with someone who accepts him for who is and not his outward appearance.   I rambled on for too long and it probably doesn't make much sense but whatever. I'm too lazy and tired to proofread."
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,guyofred,4,Tue May 26 05:04:18 2015 UTC,"Nice to see you here, I always love reading your writeups on the /r/anime discussion threads.  I definitely agree with all the points you mentioned, and we briefly talked about this in the other comment thread xD. What I was especially interested in was when you said:   So which is worth more? Hayama of course and Hachiman knows that.   At this point, I can kind of see both sides. On one hand, Hayama is nice to everyone and can make them feel all snuggly inside, but he hasn't really been an impetus for change in many situations. On the other hand, Hikki has been the mastermind behind most of the changes throughout the story and has altered many peoples' lives more significantly (not only the people he has directly sought to help, but others that he influenced passively as well like Yukinon). I kind of feel in this scenario that Hikki could also be worth more in this scenario, but I definitely understand that   What Hachiman wants is a relationship with someone who accepts him for who is and not his outward appearance.   Thoughts?"
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,AeroSkyline,2,Tue May 26 05:15:34 2015 UTC,"What Hachiman wants is a relationship with someone who accepts him for who is and not his outward appearance.   Thoughts?   This why Yui and Yukino are the main characters. They see it in Hachiman. Yui is attracted to him because deep down inside he really is a good person, and she can see that. Due to the fact that she knows how good people should act. But that doesn't answer why she hangs around with Hayama's Group. Maybe it does and I just don't see it.   For Yukino she is basically the same as 8man, deep down she is actually a good person. That is why maybe she made the club. But unlike 8man she does not understand how people actually act fake to get what they want. She sees them as what they are, she maybe that is why she says "" I don't understand "". She doesn't understand what a genuine thing means because she always thought that the way people act is who they were and not a mask that can be taken off. So she begins to realize her cold exterior is nothing but armor to try and protect her from being hurt, she begins to realize it and relaxes towards 8man. Beginning to act Genuine towards him and show her true colors, 8man is melting away the cold exterior slowly. Major LN Spoiler  Damn this seems so one sided, maybe because we know very little about Yui and know a lot more of Yukino. i still feeling like I am shipping though fuck  Please don't ask me to talk about Iroha, she is a side character their to create plot not become a part of it. I only explained Hayama because well he seems to be creating or being part in the next plot. All I can say is Iroha is almost exactly the same as Hayama."

OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,3,Tue May 26 11:49:24 2015 UTC,"As you well know, I feel obligated to contribute my two cents wherever Hayama's concerned, and the theory of fundamental evil provides an interesting perspective on his character in particular.   For most of the series to date, Hayama has been deprived the right to be genuine. He openly shows and admits to 8man that he is not a nice guy, yet 8man continues to frame Hayama as such. It is not that Hayama is, in fact, an essentially do-no-wrong person but that, from the outsider perspective, he is incapable of doing wrong. 8man notes in volume 4: ""The truth is that people don’t see you as who you truly are. They only see what they want to see, the reality that they yearn for."" Social identity, in other words, is more important (and more damning) than authentic identity. Hayama is incapable of both duplicity and authenticity, because his character is defined within a framework of expectations. Duplicity, because he can only be the golden boy, and authenticity, because expectations force him to dissemble his self-understood identity.  Volume 10, of course, is the turning point in 8man and Hayama's relationship, because 8man realizes:   Incidentally, to return to the theory of fundamental evil, I think that we can agree that Hayama is the most ""genuine"" when he is being unkind. It follows—doesn't it?—that according to the theory of fundamental evil, one can only be genuine if one is evil. As you mention elsewhere in this thread, Hayama was introduced as a boring, nice guy. His niceness is not seen as superficial (because we have no idea that he has depth to him), but his niceness makes him seem like a superficial character (because we connote niceness with simplicity). For that reason, we value him less as a character. When we see that he is capable of ""evil,"" we value him more, because he is a genuine character. And it's when we combine these qualities that we see him as a complex character, because he, though ""not a nice guy"" (to use his words), forces himself to play the role of the kind arbitrator, regardless of his own intentions. He is at cross purposes with and within himself—and that's why he merits discussion.  That's too much essentialism for one day. But social identity is, I suspect, an essential perspective. While I think that it's worth connecting this argument to 8man and the Service Club, I'm not the one to do it. I'm just in it for Hayama, yo."
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,sonanddeath,3,Tue May 26 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this really helped cleared out the conversation between 8man and Hayama when they both said 'I hate you'. Hayama is very likely saying that out of jealousy that 8man's circle of friends is able to accept him for he is ( genuine) whereas for Hayama he had to keep his facade on due to expectations from other people, which is exactly what 8man considered not 'genuine'. This is a really impressive interpretation that you made there, thanks for the enlightenment!"
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,wuulala,2,Wed May 27 01:14:47 2015 UTC,"Both show the complexities of a human being, one thing I like about this series.  Hayato isn't that high above Hachiman anymore, at least not after that bamboo forrest scene. Pushing the task fully on Hachiman is a gesture of cruelty and he knows it. He was also aware of the expected results from the very start and the people that would get hurt in the process, yet he did not do anything to stop it.  Does that make him bad? No. He just did (or in this case didn't do) what was necessary to preserve the status quo of his clique.  One could say Hayato felt remorse afterwards and took advantage of the Orimoto situation to try and patch things up. Unfortunately he lacks the understanding or ability to do so. Why? Spoiler vol 10 Not so sure about that. What is certain is that lacking the ability, he copied the tactics of the only person whom he saw was successful, Hachiman.  Well, we all know what happened next, but what was Hayato really after? In my opinion, he tried to fix the relationship Hachiman had with the girls, but by not understanding what the basis for that relationship was, he thought that they would make up as easy as his clique did.  After that incident, he gave up on trying. I'd say this is also the point where he accepted the ""I'm not a nice guy"" mentality to its fullest and also started developing a small hatred for Hachiman.   I'll not go into vol 10 because I need to re-read it in order to make a full opinion and I wrote this in a rush. Also please avoid waifu wars in the replies, I'm kinda fed up for a while of them."
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,Lonaticus,2,Tue May 26 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said for the most part. I love how when Hayama was first introduced he just seemed like another perfect nice guy with girls flocking him that's in any harem. I love how Yahari takes standard harem tropes and ""bends"" them. It's funny how Hayama was introduced to contrast someone at the ""top"" to someone on the ""bottom"" but now it's scary how they're different but in a different way especially after volume 10.   I really hate waifu wars but that's unfortunately a large part of the sub. I can only see it escalating after next episode. Luckily we have actual discussion threads like these once in a while."

OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Tue May 26 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said. But I feel as if, in the next volume we are going to see a darker side of Hayato then we ever saw. I do knot know what he will do, but all I know is that he is jealous of 8man and hates losing to him. What is he jealous of? The ability of how 8man seems to win consistently? Right now Hayato is as much as a mystery as Yukino and Yui."
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Tue May 26 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"I think the thing that Hikki wants though isn't for the club members to 'act good' (paraphrasing from the explanation) but more that he wants them to become 'good.'  While that quote is true in and of itself, I think it's kind of different from the nuances that Watari wants us to see.  I'm open to discussion and other peoples' viewpoints, but that's how I see it. If I'm misinterpreting the quote, please feel free to enlighten me."
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,AeroSkyline,2,Tue May 26 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"But in this sense, the ACT of acting good makes them more ""good"" than actually BEING ""good"". Wouldn't the actor, be more ""good"" than the naturally ""good"" person just because they wanted to change, to improve?"
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,AeroSkyline,2,Tue May 26 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"I think an important distinction to make is that there's a difference between being 'innately good' and changing to become better. I think when Hikki's asking for something genuine, he's looking for them to change to be 'good' because he acknowledges that they may not be 'good' to begin with.   So in this case, I think Hikki would prefer having Yui and Yukinon change to become more similar to this ideal rather than fake it. From my perspective, Hikki just wants to avoid what he considers to be superficial largely because, if you fake something, it generally requires little effort to preserve, which means it could be broken just as easily. This is highlighted in the EP 7 Spoilers"
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,AeroSkyline,2,Tue May 26 02:58:39 2015 UTC,"I partially agree, he wants them to change. However, many of his monologues imply he also wants them to be naturally ""genuine"". By using the philosophy of the quote, he would be contradicting himself.  In response to your edit: Since the ""superficial"" one is trying to be more ""genuine"" than the naturally ""genuine"" one,, it would still be contradictory. While it may seem it would take little to break it down, a faker going all the way would go the extra length to keep everything stable. The ""fake"" would still be more ""real""."
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,AeroSkyline,2,Tue May 26 03:07:22 2015 UTC,"I partially agree, he wants them to change. However, many of his monologues imply he also wants them to be naturally ""genuine"". By using the philosophy of the quote, he would be contradicting himself.   I can definitely understand where you're coming from, but one of the main things driving my perspective is that EP 7 Spoilers I suppose that in and of itself proves that he is contradicting himself, but I think he's trying to move away from what he wanted before (which would be wanting them to be naturally genuine).  I'm not sure if I'm understanding everything 100% correctly, but I think one of the main differences in our perspectives is whether or not the faker would actually go to an extra length. From my perspective, the faker has it easy because he / she can easily set up a false facade and perpetuate it. However, the person looking to be 'genuine' has to actually change their moral character. If you remember from S1EP1, Yukinon says that those who 'don't have talent' shouldn't be jealous of those that 'do have talent' because those that 'do have talent' have put in an unimaginable amount of effort to reach that proficiency.  Feel free to clarify if there's anything that I may have taken the wrong way though.  So far this has been a really nice discussion! :D"
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,1 point,Tue May 26 03:32:36 2015 UTC,"My view is that the faker has it harder. The naturally talented one, if it's truly natural, has it easy, as they have no problem doing what they're doing. However, the faker, who isn't natural, has to work hard to act natural. For example, take a psychopath compared to a normal person. The normal guy can live their life normally, naturally. However, for the psychopath, he would have to work to live normally. This is where I believe Yukino is wrong. Her definition of talent isn't actually talent, but hard work. I've always found that that line was just a way to justify looking down on others.  In the title quotes philosophy, it's the faker that has to work. And in the process of trying to become the real thing, they become more real than the original, since they had to work for it."
OreGairuSNAFU,37a1xp,AeroSkyline,1 point,Tue May 26 03:41:24 2015 UTC,"Right, the naturally talented one definitely has it harder than the faker. What I'm trying to get at though is that someone who is trying to change to become more like the ideal (rather than trying to fake it or be 'born like that') has it even harder than the faker.   So, if I'm understanding you correctly, I think your main point is that the faker has it much harder than the person that is naturally talented because the faker has to actually work to maintain that facade while the naturally talented one doesn't really have to do anything, right? I think that lies perfectly in accordance with my belief that Hikki is just looking for his clubmates to actually change themselves to be more like the ideal (along with him, of course), which I believe is harder than both faking and being born like that."

Even after all the developments in the anime (or LN volume 10) which softens his relationship with Yui to the point of she became someone he cares about, I somehow get the sense that he is not attracted to Yui at the same level as Yukinon.  ...I just want to see Yui smile .__."

OreGairuSNAFU,372ank,angel10701,3,Sun May 24 23:55:23 2015 UTC,...I just want to see Yui smile .__.   You and me both.
OreGairuSNAFU,372ank,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,9,Sun May 24 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"Yui's relationship with 8man is like that of a mother and a child. She's too emotionally mature and too outspoken for him to ever react to her in anything besides a defensive manner.   Yet she's not emotionally mature enough. She doesn't know how to approach him, in order to get closer, without him turning fearful and defensive. This is where Sensei's methods are more appropriate, and you saw that just this last episode. If Yui ever wants to develop a proper romantic relationship with him, she needs to do a bit of growing up herself, and this is what I honestly expect in the next volume.  Yes, I expect 11 to be a volume at least partially focused on Yui's development. I also think that the feelings expressed in the synopsis were hers. Watari-sensei has been experimenting with other character's inner thoughts in vol 10 memorandums, remember that.  If you think 8man likes only the silent beauty types, you're wrong. He's also into the motherly types, or even younger types. But like I said before, I do not expect this to end in a casual romantic fashion like other series. He's been breaking too many tropes for that. Even if it does, I hope it ends in a satisfactory manner, be it painful or not for some of the characters involved.  P.S. As much as I love the ship wars- and will proudly ship Iroha to the bitter end, because I think she's the perfect person for him in his current state of mind- this series has never been about that anyway. It's a coming of age story, where people start to understand who they are and try to understand others."
OreGairuSNAFU,372ank,ZeroReq011,4,Sun May 24 07:04:07 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I don't think 8man likes only the silent beauty types. In fact, I  wouldn't agree in the slightest to such a statement. If I were to be completely honest, I wouldn't know his exact type.   I hate nice girls. Just exchanging pleasantries with them makes me curious,and texting each other makes me feel restless. If I get a call, for the rest of the day, I’ll keep checking my call history with a stupid grin on my face. But I know the truth. They’re just being nice. Anyone nice to me is nice to others too. But I always find myself on the verge of forgetting that. If the truth is a cruel mistress, then a lie must be a nice girl. And so, niceness is a lie. I would always hold expectation. I would always misunderstand. At some point, I stopped hoping. An experienced loner never falls for the same trap twice. A lone warrior, surviving hundreds of battles. When it comes to losing, I’m the strongest. That’s why, no matter what happens, I will always hate nice girls.   Perhaps I'm reading this excerpt/quote completely wrong, but if I remember correctly, he gave this statement directly after telling Yui she didn't need her to pity him. All the bullshit he went through with Orimoto and others turned him into such a cynic, pushing him away from people entirely with a distinct disdain towards 'nice girls.' If I may be so bold, I think 8man is a lot like Kyon; I think he's unreliable, at the very least in this instance.   As I said, I haven't read the light novels yet so I know I'm missing out on a lot of Hachiman's thoughts. Regardless, I don't think a relationship with Yukino would be the best for his development. She's not a nice girl. I don't doubt that they could be happy. In fact, I don't think they'd be a bad couple, but I feel like Yui would just be better for him overall.   Out of curiosity, is Iroha actually a possibility in the slightest in the LN, or is that just your wishful thinking? xD"

OreGairuSNAFU,372ank,asianedy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"Given that he's still hanging around Yui and Yukino (it's hard to deny that she's becoming more and more nice girlish), I'd agree with that statement. He's come a long, long way from the loner he was in the beginning.  I don't necessarily agree with your conclusion on what the narrative of the show is,   And so the narrative of the show focuses on developing the two to the point where they are socially mature, where they can engage in that conscious intimacy. And what’s driving it all, what’s driving the two to develop the most dramatically, is the subconscious intimacy they share.   but I respect the amount of effort you put into writing these posts.

They've been spending time with each other for some time now, and they've only started to become more uncomfortable with each other in that respect. I was trying to find the foundations to this development, and ""subconscious intimacy"" was where I ended up on.  Granted, you don't have to agree with my logic at the end of the day, but I do appreciate you respecting the efforts I've invested into establishing this position.

He is easily manipulated by cuteness the same goes for Yukino, but deep down In that cooled exterior is a nice girl also so it is possible. But flags mate flags. Preach it lady wasn't the only one he states it in season 1 and like the first like 5 LN. Broken people fine comfort in broken people not the other way around. Yukino and 8man are similar but different they are antisocial, cold, and well not very nice. They are perfect because of how they are been broken by society or by family and needs help picking up after each other to fix it. I really don't understand why people can not see it at all.  Plus secondary characters are just their to create plot not be a part of it ex, Iroha"
OreGairuSNAFU,372ank,FrozenFyre,3,Sun May 24 08:03:12 2015 UTC,"Naw, I already agree that the flags are there. Entire post was about it. Debating for the sake of debating.  I can't argue with that one. Common sense would warn him that nice girls are never genuine, given his prior experience with them. But he also goes on to state that he always finds himself on the verge of forgetting that. It wouldn't be completely impossible for Yui to finally push him past the verge, albeit it's unlikely.  I don't believe 8man's definition of a nice girl is within Yukino. Doesn't mean they won't end up together."

OreGairuSNAFU,372ank,Limakoko,-2,Sun May 24 08:59:45 2015 UTC,"Iroha best? That is a good one. Secondary characters never get the MC. The story so far has focused mainly on Yukino and finding about her and why she is so broken. It will continue on as is. So far Yukino since Volume 1 has gotten almost as much time as 8man even in the show to.   Yui is not the motherly type at all. She is the third wheel the wing man of the story. All protagonist must have one.  Iroha their is no way, she still like Hayato she even said so on the tram on the way back from destiny land. So does she like 8man, no because she consistly jokes and turns him down and manipulates him into doing stuff for him by being cute. Plus 8man compares her to haruno which he calls a demon. I see no attraction with her by far worst girl I would prefer Yui than her.  Yukino seriously have you not read the LN? She is as broken as 8man but in a different way, we are slowly starting to find out about her. She also starts to become closer to 8man than any other character next to Yui. She may be a silent beauty, but she become comfortable and talkative around 8man when they are alone. All the plot flags since volume 1 point to her. Also she is as broken as 8man what is better than to people who are broken to help fix each other. It only makes sense.   So please stop with this Iroha is best bullshit because she is the complete opposite. A sociopathic women who uses 8man to her convenience. Her cuteness is a mask to hide he true self nothing more nothing less she does what she does to act normal. I wish something bad would happen to her oh wait she already got turned down by Hayato lol. But the weird thing was she wasn't phased by it she accepted and said I'll just try again later. Saying she wants something genuine and bullshit also. It is all stupid and she needs to have her mouth sowed shut.  Also since their is 2 volumes left this one will without a doubt focus on character development and relationship building. Not just one person. Plus the story always seems to lean towards Yukino and 8man weird.  https://thereforeitis.wordpress.com/2015/05/21/my-teenage-romantic-comedy-snafu-an-angel-and-her-knight/  read this if you need more convincing.

OreGairuSNAFU,372ank,asianedy,5,Thu Jun 25 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, I expect an 8man/Yukino ending because the entire point of the series is about their relationship. A majority of the plot stems from the interactions between the two. Yeah Yui and Iroha do play a role as well but lets be real.   The problem with Yui is that her role in the story is literally stopping the other two from butting heads (being the glue that holds the club together), bridge them from time to time to grow them closer, and to be first love interest for the MC. That's it. Feel free to disagree but Yui really gets no backstory, no ""problems"" of her own that the club has to deal with since the beginning of the series, etc."
OreGairuSNAFU,372ank,KitKatxz,8,Sun May 24 14:07:31 2015 UTC,I honestly feel that if Yui and Yukino's positions were switched (like Yui was the one faking and stuff) then 8man would've acted the same way.

OreGairuSNAFU,372ank,EssentialPepin,5,Sun May 24 05:37:07 2015 UTC,Ehh Yui is the type of person who will find happiness if 8man and Yukinon are happy. That's just who she is as a person (not that it makes it any better for readers who like Yui) because I'm pretty sure she loves them equally

Like 'mega internal monologue and disinterest + slight embarassment' and 'nervous sp-sp-speaking + social anxiety' swimmingly.  Plus they're both okay with H :D (LN's mentioned that 8man did have doujins and Tomoko regularly plays Otome games), so I foresee no awkward situations occurring~  Of course, ""Ssennnnpaaaiii~~!"" in that drawn out, whiny voice is also pretty damn cute, so I'm torn between that and 'D-D-do-do...mo...'.

He lied about people supporting her, and even did it for Yukino if you did not get that from the teacher when she was explaining human emotions to hachiman, which he does not understand."

It was quite clear that he got Isshiki into office to preserve his club room environment and used Komachi as a convenient reason to do so. He then helped Iroha again because of some hazy notion that he wanted to keep Yukino away from the matter to protect her.    These facts do not change the fact that Iroha has the best chemistry with Hikki out of all the girls. She;s the closest to his sister, whom we already know is the only person he ever allowed himself to be close to. Komachi even said, ""If I wasn't your sister, you'd probably never talk to me."" Hikki monologued , 'I probably would have fell for you instantly,' or something along those lines.    There is no problem with people manipulating each other, they do it all the time.

Just look at Yui and Yuki (Yui manipulates Yukinon frequently, especially with those puppy dog eyes of doom). It's only a problem when it turns malicious / spiteful.   That is the definition of Iroha, she is spiteful and malicious. Her cute emotions are fake nothing more nothing less.   But Yui and Yukino are friends, so of course she will except who the fuck wouldn't.  Also how the fuck is does she have chemistry again? Because I don't see it. I see it with two people who have been broken by society. But I do not see it with a sociopathic girl, who blackmails and is in love with Hayato. Just really don't see it.  Yukino is exactly like 8man exactly, something to her happened that made her who she is cold and calculating, that changes when she is around 8man alone, she becomes well a high school girl."

Manipulative, like a combination of Haruno and Komachi (a less quit version) he sees her as a sister character. Don't argue 10.5 because she black mails him in chapter 3. But for use Yukino fans we have chapter 9 and 10 actually all of chapter 10 you know all 9 volumes. Plus she still likes Hayato, I have come to conclusion that she is a sociopath who only wants a relationship to look normal. She is in no way good for 8man where Yukino is broken as bad as 8man, it is why she comes across cold. But that changes we it is just her and him she becomes the cutest thing ever.

OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,UrdnotWrex_Senpai,-1,Fri May 22 02:10:49 2015 UTC,I see worst girl what are you talking about?
OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,LadWatcherIsHere,15,Sat May 23 22:36:11 2015 UTC,"I know almost every single fan believes that this could have been a perfect episode if it wasn't for 8man's face during the Genuine Scene.  But y'know, what exactly did you wanted? To see his eyes changed and with better iris? To see some outstanding animation in his crying? Yes, that would have been good to watch. But in all honestly, people don't exactly look pretty when they cry. 8man's face looked weird but that's actually how a person's face looks when they're crying.  Sure, Yui might be able to handle it a little better but that's because she's more used to express her feelings while 8man opened himself to someone for the first time in a long time and even that was enough to send him to tears. It's no wonder why his expressions looked like that."
OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,pEuAsTsSy,11,Fri May 22 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"Hachiman breaking down was so powerful, I couldn't take all the feels, tears just came streaming down my face on their own...voice acting and animation were beyond superb.   ""No way."" were the first words that came out of my mouth, and when I saw the flashback and heard his thoughts...it was already too late. The scene makes me cry no matter how many times I re-watch it. I expected him to break down at some point in the series, and Feel didn't disappoint, it was really powerful.  Also I totally loved this entire scene.  Definitely my favorite episode so far! Glad to be on this sub, wish I knew about it earlier."
OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,albert_2mb,6,Fri May 22 06:55:08 2015 UTC,"Hachiman breaking down[1]    was so powerful, I couldn't take all the feels, tears just came streaming down my face on their own...voice acting and animation were beyond superb.   Definitely. Definitely. Truth be told, I can't take it anymore after episode 7, and deliberately spoiled myself by finishing the whole volume 9 in one sitting, and I definitely cried. One week later, even while I've spoiled myself hard until volume 10, I still cried watching this scene. All those flashbacks, his thoughts, feelings and yearning really strongly resonates within me."
OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,pEuAsTsSy,3,Fri May 22 08:26:44 2015 UTC,"I'm tempted to read the light novels, but I managed not to do so yet! The struggle is real...although I heard from the LN readers that the next episode is supposed to be even better than this one...so I think I won't be doing any reading just yet, I kind of love going into the anime without knowing what will happen.  It's going to be a long week!"
OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,DaniSenpai,3,Fri May 22 08:42:15 2015 UTC,"You can just read past chapters (I'm doing so myself), even though you might already know what's gonna happen in the end of the volume, there's still a ton of things that the anime skips and that really help you understand each character more, plus, first season Hachiman is so different from the LN's one."
OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,CrazystuffIsee,5,Fri May 22 17:08:31 2015 UTC,"You should post these early given how people view the raws early. Although I'm not sure how people react because it'll be immediately spoiling those who wait.  Raws typically come out at around 10 am PST  So to stay on topic of the thread, the Op has iroha at the end so that's pretty subtle given what the episode is all about. I love it even in its raw version and putting in spyro 's translations. The one thing that bothered me was 8 man's face as he said he what he wanted. Even then I can complain but I don't think I can change much other than maybe the weird nose lines which to me seemed out of placed. Also the thing to notice first is Yui doesn't hold her hand out after the request. Then comes the door slam from Yukino which sends chills and great message of her confusion.   The next episode you can probably see the same format of 1 chapter in half an episode so I'm hoping for the next best part delivers. Otherwise it'll be like the ramen scene being cut (doubt it)"
OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,Lonaticus,3,Fri May 22 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"It's not like the ramen scene was indispensable to the overarching plot. They can still fill 2 chapters into one episode next week if they drop the ED, and even the OP, maybe. But it's up to them. Feel adds its own little twists to the series, and so far I loved them (think of the door slam). If that means cutting segments, I'm ok with it. After all, the anime shouldn't be a 100% mirror of the LN.   For this episode yea, 8man's expressions could've been done better, especially the eyes and the nose. But then again, this is a person who has been keeping his emotions inside for a long time, so expressing them with the power Yui has for example is hard. He's clumsy at it, and that's what makes it more genuine. I can't even begin to think how many retakes that whole scene must've had."
OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,CrazystuffIsee,2,Fri May 22 02:29:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I know why they cut it out. It's like how Saki get's cut out in all her small moments. As far as I'm concerned it was just something I wanted to see because of the interactions xD If we expected a full mirror it would be 70% monologue where the studio is trying to drag the scenery.  I can understand the eyes because they were already pretty close so add in the lower part of the eye a bit higher will look different on him. I paused at the face just so I could be sure what I'm talking about. I guess the nose bothers me so much I generalized the face because if you look at others it's basically a small lining not a weird pentagon that is suppose to be a side of his nose (just right before he says what he wants). I probably got into a bit too much detail than it's needed because the scene was still fantastic and it was more than what I could imagine it would turn out to be. The voice acting was just wow and the animation really were close to making me tear up even though I anticipated the scene and used the LN translations. The power of just animation an their voices drove it home.

Heck! I might even re-watch both seasons once this one ends!   But there's just one thing I don't get, what's the ""playing dirty"" Yui and Yukino were talking about in the club room? At first I thought this was the point where the two main girls declare battle against each other, only so that one will be victorious and go home with the main character, but this isn't your regular romantic comedy, and after the breakdown in the rooftop that was definitely not that kind of scene."

OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,doominator10,2,Fri May 22 18:40:27 2015 UTC,"As a very condensed version, Yukino and 8man both use logic and reasoning to manipulate / persuade / coerce people. Yui, (especially towards Yukino), uses emotions as her main arguments. Ex. Yukino and 8man both logically agree that since 'it' is his fault, he should be the one to deal with it. Yui basically said, no, that's not correct because I don't like it and it makes me sad ;_;. You can't use logic to argue against that, hence, playing 'dirty'."
OreGairuSNAFU,36trhq,socalso,3,Sat May 23 23:59:48 2015 UTC,"Damn it.  Got me the second time.  Maybe having subs to bolster my scrub-league Japanese and the three glasses of rye helped it along, but that's just making excuses probably.  Only one thing I miss from the LN here, and I'm not sure if it's just a matter of translation because I obviously never read the original Japanese text, but I'm slightly disappointed that they kind of glossed the brilliantly subversive allusion to the ""sour grapes"" fable into a more generic phrasing that didn't explicitly reference it.  I thought that was a fantastic literary moment in the midst of this scene in Vol 9.  Ultimately his aside was already going to run long, though.  That aside, it was pretty much everything I was hoping it would be.  For all I know that was inserted in translation and never part of the original Japanese, though it would fit with 8man's literary bent.  Onward to Pan-san's Bamboo Hunt, now.  Maybe we'll get a flashback next episode to 8man ""winning"" a Pan-san doll for Yukinoshita on their ""date?""  I don't think we've actually seen Pan-san up to this point so it's possible they'll chop that scene altogether?  It would be a bit of a shame, but I half suspect it'll get left on the cutting room floor just for the sake of not having to take time to retroactively explain Yukinoshita's adoration of the ugly little bastard.  If so, I wonder if that'll have an impact on spoiler, since that was where they presumably bought it."

What he wishes for was actually a part of the genuine speech so I dont know how much of it they adapted based on the raws  He actually wants sour grapes oddly enough; he doesnt care for a ""normal"" relationship per se (which is what Yui aims for most likely). He literally says something about not caring for sweet fruits  The general idea people say is 8man wants to understand and wants to be with someone who wishes to be understood. its a little more nuanced than that since he's actually okay if they dont understand each other fully but at least they are trying to.  Also, theres a small chance nice girls is still in play but I think he just not into Yui romantically"
OreGairuSNAFU,36tqg6,Fruitsy,3,Fri May 22 02:07:20 2015 UTC,"She's not out of the running and it wasn't a rejection of her feelings.  He didn't need her to lead him by the hand in that moment - he was capable of going with her of his own volition, doing something because he wanted, not because he was being lead to do it.  As far as 8man is concerned, there was no romantic sub-text to anything going on in the clubroom - not at that time, anyways.  That's pretty clear in the LN, maybe less so in the anime."
OreGairuSNAFU,36tqg6,Fruitsy,1 point,Fri May 22 03:09:06 2015 UTC,No one is out until theyre out obviously. But you cant tell me that Yui in Vol 11 is basically in sink or swim mode and that Yukino has all the flags going for her. I dont really mind who he ends up with as long as the story is written in a ways such that it feels natural/not forced aka Yui/Yukino/Iroha not turning out to be rebound girl.  11 is when all the feelings the club members have with regards to each other are going to be exposed one way or another.   Yeah the last main hurdle for 8man is the fact that he can be loved by girls so we got an entire volume about that.

He makes the distinction   Spoiler  HE doesnt want to be understood because he realizes that he probably will never be. But he wants to be the one to do the understanding. Thats why he literally says its an arrogant desire but what if he meets someone who can accept that. Thats what he truely wants.
OreGairuSNAFU,36tqg6,ShrewOne,1 point,Fri May 22 02:40:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I misread your comment. Thought you said he doesn't want to understand. Well, I'd disagree with part your assessment, but to each our own."
OreGairuSNAFU,36tqg6,digbick117,1 point,Fri May 22 02:56:28 2015 UTC,Thats fine; to be honest 8man himself isnt truely sure what he wants to theres a lot of guesswork here. We wont know until the very end

OreGairuSNAFU,36tqg6,KitKatxz,3,Fri May 22 05:33:08 2015 UTC,"I think there's something people are forgetting and it's that Hachiman just broke down into pieces, he had never done something like that and was hit really hard when Yukino left, him rejecting Yui's hand does not mean that he rejects her, it's just that after he recovered he didn't need to be dragged.  Also, he's going through some hard times right now, realizing all his doings were wrong? All his ideals about being alone? Realizing he's not left out for once? And that there are people that care about him? I think he wants to get his friendships sorted out before he can go after something more."

OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,Zereon,3,Fri May 22 18:14:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for writing this  Its really helpful. I appreciate it!
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,Cult_films,3,Fri May 22 18:39:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks ^  The anime has a lot of subplots and there are honestly much better users down here who can explain it in brief, I'm hoping that they can correct any mistakes or improve on parts of the explanation.  The explanation for Ep 9 next week is going to be much worse though, since I'm not too sure about that part in the LN despite reading it twice. I'll look forward to any explanation by the Yukinon experts :D (I think Yukipedias would be a good name for them, I'm more of a Hayapedia)"
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,Zereon,3,Fri May 22 19:00:01 2015 UTC,"If I have ever questions again, I know who to ask ;)  Btw. although you don't consider yourself as an otaku I think your knowledge and understanding of those things reveal otherwise and I - if I would be in your shoes - would be proud of it."
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,iskow,2,Fri May 22 21:27:47 2015 UTC,"To add to Zereon's awesome post, Yukino's desire to be SC prez may have been very real. In the LNs Yukino knew a lot about the election process and other stuff about the SC. And Yukino is the type to know about all the little things in stuff that she's really interested in, she can get really detailed about it, and 8man sometimes teases her about it. So Meguri's dream was something of  a clue as to what Yukino really wanted, because if you think about it, what the service club does everyday isn't really much, and by adding the SC workload, their days would have been more interesting. Heck, the trio would have made the school's best SC combo. Yukino didn't say it outright, because she isn't directly honest, also, she assumed 8man would eventually understand her, and she got disappointed because of it, in the same way 8man reacted with Yukino when he found out she didn't tell him the ""truth"" in S1. This hit her hard, in the same way that what happened in S1 hit 8man hard, but he got over it because he saw Yukino backed into a corner, and Yukino gave him a satisfying enough answer to make him move on. Yukino is different though, in S1 we are led to believe that the service club was Hiratsuka's way of rehabilitating 8man, but IMO - and there have also been several hints that this might be the case - it is mainly there for Yukino. 8man, rotten as he is, is in a way, stronger than Yukino. Yukino reacted badly, she decided to just give up and stop caring. Yukino has a lot of reasons as to why she reacts the way she does and why she just is. Not sure if I should talk about them here cause they might spoil the next ep, but look forward to it! Especially if you ship em. :)"
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,manamono,5,Sat May 23 08:29:59 2015 UTC,"WOW Man, a big THANK YOU!  Taking your time to write all this, working so hard to explain it to me, I wish I could give you gold you for your efforts. Have my upvote - some imaginary internetpoints is all I can do but trust me; you helped a grateful stranger a lot today!  So far I am proud to say that I ""understood"" the story as you did until line 139. There you start to enlighten me. I never could get the connection between ""you play dirty"" and ""you acted also like everything is okay, dont accuse me of that"".  I was also wondering if Yukinoshita (secretly) wanted to become president and was therefor angry at Hikki (expecting him to ""understand her"" and made the complaint he wouldn't - but this thought of mine was so vague and apparently not true).  Thanks for shedding light onto this whole messed up club situation. I had an idea of them being kinda uncomfortable with the superficial atmosphere of ""we are okay"" but I thought; this can't be the only reason because they could just address that or accept it like the others did - there has to be more - seems like I was wrong.  The ""genuine""-part is still a little hard for me to grasp but I guess I will go with ""honesty""? So he wants to understand others (especially those two since they are dear to him) and basically would prefer to see them act out on their feelings instead of having this club atmosphere.  Again: Thank you! Your work was not in vain. I read the whole thing and it helped me a lot. Especially since the excerpt-dialogues had some ""behind the scene thoughts"" if 8man which weren't in the anime.  You are a lifesaver... or at least you made someone pretty happy and brought him closure tonight ;)"
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,Lonaticus,3,Fri May 22 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"Really like your interpretation especially the reason behind Yui getting hurt after the confession and the reason about why Yukino told Hachiman not to come anymore.  But I feel like the mention of LN dialogues are not necessary here. Your explanation is already great on its own (the best one I have read so far). The mention of LN dialogues might give the feeling that the anime is not clear on its own. While it's true that LN provides greater details, I believe the points conveyed in the anime are also enough to deduct the same conclusion. Also, if I were an anime watcher who plans to read LN later, I wouldn't like this so much haha."
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,FrozenFyre,2,Fri May 22 19:14:11 2015 UTC,"Great write-up! Also, don't worry, putting this much effort into a good story doesn't make you an otaku. Shamelessly posting Iroha pics non-stop does  ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )  P.S. Stop downvoting such posts guys. For all we know he  wants to know what the hell happened."
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,manamono,8,Sat May 23 09:27:32 2015 UTC,I feel like I wouldn't be able to explain it properly but you might be able to figure it out if you go through /r/anime's discussion threads. There's some really good insight into why all this happened and insight into the characters.
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,socalso,7,Fri May 22 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, this messy situation is not really about them wanting to confess their love or anything. Yukino did mention that she totally hated the way he does thing (and we hadn't seen yukino like this since season 1, despite the fact that the method hachiman used looks pretty similar on the surface.  There were many problems going on there, and I encourage you to rewatch this season outside the romantic point of view. I believe it's more fun to explore the interactions and words on your own, and come up with your own understanding. For example, Think about Yukino's words after hachiman (kinda) solved Hayato group situation, Haruno's words on the day that she met yukino at that restaurant, Hachiman's inner monologue, etc.   Some example of something you might have missed:  http://puu.sh/hxoJl/810fed3af9.png  Isn't Yui and Hachiman's desperation of trying to protect the club by stopping Yukino from becoming the president similar to this incident in some way? How this incident changed Hachiman in Yukino's eyes is one of the keys of the conflict so far in ss2.   This is not all of it, but if you truly wish for a thorough explanation, I will come back again in the evening. I don't have enough time to write everything down right now haha.  [EDIT] well seems like there are people writing it already, so yay no work. To work is to lose to da system!"
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,smugvillain,3,Fri May 22 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"Kind of have to go back to the first half of the series to see where all of this is coming from, if the connections aren't obvious to you.  All of this is the culmination of tensions extending back to their beginnings.  For starters, this isn't a romantic squabble (not foremost at least) and has nothing to do with Yui and Yukino wanting to make a love confession.  It's more about the tensions between feelings of friendship (and yes, love) and ideological expectations that they've all failed to live up to in each other's eyes.  They thought they already understood each other pretty well because their ""pretty words"" resonated with each other.  They keep proving themselves wrong and its put huge tensions on what was once a stable dynamic.    TLDR: You should go back to S1 if you're lost on where all of this is coming from.  Better yet, read the LNs.  Should definitely make some things clearer.  We can only explain so much if you're missing the fundamentals."

I always thought I would understand japanese stereotypes. Their weird way of thinking. Solving those puzzles around ""why didn't she just tell him"" is the most fun in other animes but this anime breaks my mind.  Maybe they did not show smth. important from the manga or they expect another level of mindreading from the viewer. I am seriously excited for the first reasonable explanation I get from people here.  Unfortunatly the comments on the streaming-site aren't helping, not many are wondering whats going on and go just with the ""we all cry bcs. we are so unhappy and now we cry bcs. we are happy""-flow."
OreGairuSNAFU,36viia,ImAlAl,2,Fri May 22 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"Too few users who bother to explain, everybody is just going with the flow   We've all got lives outside of this sub and wherever else we're talking about this show, and you're not the first person to ask questions like this.  Frankly, this is a well-worn topic around here and you'd probably find answers to your questions just by browsing old threads.  Most of us are happy to have interesting conversations about this series because it has depth and nuance lacking in other, superficially similar shows, and most of the regulars are pretty cool guys who like to hash out the complexities.  That doesn't mean we're going to drop what we're doing to answer the same old question week after week.

OreGairuSNAFU,36kgc6,MaximusPrimeRib,6,Wed May 20 04:51:43 2015 UTC,"Not yet. If they get picked up now, they'll force people to take down the fan translations. Also, Yen Press has a very slow release schedule. They haven't even finished Spice and Wolf yet. Last vol will be published this autumn, I think.   With the Internet's attention span of seconds, people will forget about this series by the time we get an official vol 11 or 12 translated.  You also have the issue of quality translations. The LN contains Bakemonogatari-level amount of pop-culture and anime references. So that makes translating it a bit difficult."
OreGairuSNAFU,36kgc6,Lonaticus,1 point,Wed May 20 07:36:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm I see your point. Well, I'm a fairly big fan of the series and I would absolutely love to have the light novels, granted they're well translated of course, but I do understand the consequence of having the translations taken down. It could put off some fans who discovered the series late and found out that the translations were taken down. It happened to me when I watched Hidan no Aria and wanted to continue with the LNs.

OreGairuSNAFU,36i1ex,CrazystuffIsee,2,Tue May 19 23:56:46 2015 UTC,it's not canon? I'm planning on reading the LN this summer.
OreGairuSNAFU,36i1ex,wardoctr,5,Wed May 20 00:15:11 2015 UTC,They can be. Isshiki first appeared in 7.5 I believe which is why 8man knew her as the manager of the soccer team. It's just that they aren't heavily used as canon (or at all for the most part). Think of it like the OVA for Season 1. I think that entire episode was from a chapter in in the .5 volumes
OreGairuSNAFU,36i1ex,CrazystuffIsee,3,Wed May 20 00:22:52 2015 UTC,They are canon but not part of the main plot line since what happens during this extra chapters is hardly mentioned later on. Think of it as fanservice chapters like the OVA of season 1.

OreGairuSNAFU,36fuhg,MattLib,6,Tue May 19 03:54:17 2015 UTC,"It is. Though the Manga (like the Anime) skips a few things from the LN but in exchange it includes a few things that the anime skipped instead and also does a good job at showing the emotions the characters felt at that moment.  For example, there is a moment in Volume 1 where Hachiman tells Yukino right in her face that she's cute and she's left stunned for a moment, then starts rambling about how that's a logical thing and finally tells Hachiman not say things like that again, all with a red face. It's hard to see that she was indeed embarrassed by the compliment in the LN but the manga makes it easier to see.   EDIT: This was omitted from the anime though. Probably because Yukino's rambling would take too much time from the episode."

OreGairuSNAFU,36h0jt,Inori92,2,Tue May 19 15:23:47 2015 UTC,"Zaimokuza's sole purpose is for the author to break the 4th wall and vent his frustrations regarding the LN industry.

The only difference is that other characters like Hayato or Yumiko are not comedy relief while these three are comedy relief characters but they all get their share of development and backstory.  Zaimokuza, Saika and Saki are what you'll call 8man's clique since they are the only students that get involved with him out of free will when the story needs them to. Plus they all share a part of 8man's loneliness. Zaimokuza is an Otaku, Saika is a trap and Saki is scary."

OreGairuSNAFU,367zu3,DazEErR,3,Sun May 17 01:28:15 2015 UTC,"Well, flashbacks to past events do pop-up here and there, think of Hayato's summer camp confession, or Rumi.  The car accident hasn't been mentioned after that though. If it still has any plot value it will probably be mentioned in the final arc. This is all my assumption."
OreGairuSNAFU,367zu3,Lonaticus,2,Sun May 17 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"I don't see why they pick up again.... the use of that scene was to show that yukino lied to hachiman about not knowing him when they first meet ruining hachiman view of her as someone who doesn't lie.  Plus spoilers man, people might havent watch up to that part."
OreGairuSNAFU,367zu3,KitKatxz,3,Sun May 17 01:43:49 2015 UTC,"think its fine he did say question for up to LN readers  but yeah essentially they've already concluded that storyline, of course they didn't say ""hey that was you in the limo"" and ""oh yes it was me dio"" but its oregairu, if you like this show it's because it isn't always spoonfeeding u material and allowing u time and clues to figure out the context inbetween the lines"
OreGairuSNAFU,367zu3,Inori92,2,Sun May 17 02:11:15 2015 UTC,"he did say question for up to LN readers   I know it's fine asking if there's more about it, just strange why they pick it up again.   I think the anime concluded it fine."

Plus I think the studio never believed Oregairu was going to be successful given the horrible animation they gave to it during the first season so they tried to use some plot line that looked dramatic and ended the season with that."
OreGairuSNAFU,367zu3,LadWatcherIsHere,2,Sun May 17 03:07:12 2015 UTC,"Don't know what else they could do with that.  They've pretty much said everything that needs to be said about the incident and moved on from it to bigger, more immediate issues.  Unless it comes out that, I don't know, Haruno was the driver and was deliberately trying to run over Sable.  It was pretty much an accident, nobody involved had any particular culpability.  The only reason it mattered was because Yui and Yukinon were being dishonest about the fact that they knew about the incident and were (directly or indirectly) treating 8man differently than they might otherwise.  Yukino's lie may have had more long-lasting repercussions, but even that's getting dealt with - protractedly and painfully, but here we are."

OreGairuSNAFU,36392r,WoundshotGG,11,Fri May 15 18:58:45 2015 UTC,You should start reading the LN really worth it. Also way more detailed than the anime ofc.
OreGairuSNAFU,36392r,Soli18,3,Fri May 15 19:15:43 2015 UTC,"DAMNIT i had a 20 line post ready to save but i refreshed like an idiot  ok so tl;dr  I'm probably much worse than you, extremely impatient and obsessively stubborn, and i have a bad history with spoiled content, i usually drop adaptation material after i spoil myself during the air/simulcast (game of thrones, steins;gate come to mind).  First time I ever read a Light Novel, absolutely NO REGRETS. Now my all time favorite series, Oregairu LN does everything correct - though u lose out some suspense in the show, you gain foreknowledge and anticipation of the greatness to come, as well as a much more clear understanding of the overall situation through hachiman's excellent monologues and mulling.   I'm actually more hyped for future episodes now that I know what's happening, the only exception to my history of spoilers.  my two cents friend, though i can guarantee YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."
OreGairuSNAFU,36392r,Inori92,3,Fri May 15 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"For me, personally, reading the light novels actually made me take a closer look at the anime adaptation and appreciate it so much more. I have never been so hyped for a series while knowing exactly what is to come. 100% recommend reading the LN.  On a slightly related, but mostly unrelated note: IIRC there was a study done that proved that most people actually enjoy stories more after having certain events spoiled to them (the sample size was certainly large enough to be deemed acceptable). I imagine this is because they hype themselves up more wondering what route the story would have to take to achieve said event. I can certainly validate this study from my experience reading the Oregairu LN because certain events were spoiled to me on discussion threads (just bits; I pussied out after reading them) and I was truly enthused while wondering, ""Am I nearing X event yet!?""  EDIT: Sorry for the delay, but for anyone interested this is a link to the study - http://pages.ucsd.edu/~nchristenfeld/Publications_files/Spoilers.pdf"

OreGairuSNAFU,36392r,Lonaticus,2,Tue May 26 01:52:39 2015 UTC,"Can we get a reference? I'm rather curious. While it's the same case for me, reading it enhaced the experience, it's also due to the great work and personal twists done by the people at Studio Feel.  Still, the same cannot be said of other series. In Log Horizon 2's case, due to a poor adaptation, I was left disheartened; looking for faults and making comparisons, rather than enjoying the anime.  So I cannot fully agree with you. On the contrary, I believe that people should avoid spoilers for as long as they can. At least they should try and avoid them until the adaptation has been proven to be good or not."
OreGairuSNAFU,36392r,InfestedSugar,2,Sat May 16 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"I will find the link later on because I am currently bedridden due to sickness (I'm really lazy when it comes to searching for things on my phone; it's rather uncomfortable, as odd as it may sound). If anything, it should be a quick google search for any of you curious.  I also watched Log Horizon 2, only difference is that I had no knowledge of what was to happen to make a comparison with. All in all, I think the poor production value left a bad taste for all of us, regardless of having been spoiled or not.  Upon further reflection, I should probably clarify that I don't agree with the study as the objective truth. In fact, I used to believe that ""all spoilers are bad"" was the objective truth, this study and my personal experience with Oregairu only broadened my view on spoilers. The only reason why I think Oregairu is still interesting while knowing exactly what is to come is just because of how the captivating the story is written and a great portion of the enjoyment is derives from the character development leading to/gained from certain events. This may not - from my experience, does not - apply for every story. However, while I am not yet sure of the exact criteria required to come to this assumption (since everyone's taste is subjective), for me, even while expecting what is to come, Oregairu did not let me down."

OreGairuSNAFU,361hpi,liamjesse,2,Fri May 15 10:05:19 2015 UTC,It kinda looks like Yui and yukino combined lol
OreGairuSNAFU,361kwp,Cult_films,8,Fri May 15 09:28:10 2015 UTC,"Finally they gave us more Yukino, and the scene was masterfully done, the development of Hachiman and Yukino is fantastic and you could see how  much they have changed since the beginning.   I hope I will see more Yukino in the coming episodes."
OreGairuSNAFU,361kwp,paladinmahdi,3,Fri May 15 09:36:05 2015 UTC,OH YOU WILL...  AND YOU WILL REALIZE THE HUNGER IS INSATIABLE...
OreGairuSNAFU,361kwp,Inori92,6,Sun May 17 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"The scene between Komachi and 8man was so damn sweet.  8man telling Komachi ""aishiteru"" really surprised me considering that word in Japanese is rarely used since it's so emotionally charged.  But then again, 8man does really love his little sister.  So sweet."
OreGairuSNAFU,361kwp,TheMomAbides,2,Sat May 16 19:50:33 2015 UTC,Komachi belongs in the imouto pantheon
OreGairuSNAFU,361kwp,stonecaster,6,Tue May 19 07:17:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect the snow scene to have such an impact. Reading the LN and actually watching it play out was just....heartrending. And the slow ballad version of Yukino's solo after that, it sounded just like how the voice actor would feel after saying those words. The developments leading up to this point hit so well, and the slow ED just...it feels like I'm still in shock.  The genuine scene's gonna leave one hell of a hole. Much bigger than when Kamina died."
OreGairuSNAFU,361kwp,Zereon,4,Fri May 15 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"That scenes was amazing. The music, the atmosphere, the visuals, everything. I love how it transitioned into the ""new"" ED. Even Spyro says it's better than in the novels even if the monologues included. spoils  edit: oh god if they use the OP as the ED next episode I would cry"
OreGairuSNAFU,361kwp,guyofred,5,Fri May 15 14:48:17 2015 UTC,"That might explain why the tone of the scene seemed a little different from what I was expecting - but if anything, definitely more powerful."

OreGairuSNAFU,361kwp,Black_Frost88,5,Fri May 15 14:33:15 2015 UTC,Not really a plot twist at all. More like a tone shift.
OreGairuSNAFU,361kwp,guyofred,2,Fri May 15 16:13:18 2015 UTC,But you have to admit that scene will most likely be the best moment of the entire anime and LN.

From the looks of it, he wanted to take all the work on from the start to try and make everyone else happy, but it backfired because people still have problems."

OreGairuSNAFU,361sei,Lynac,3,Fri May 15 11:21:19 2015 UTC,"You're on point with 8man. For Yukino, I'd say INTP fits her personality. This quotes from here seems to describe her well:   INTPs can readily generate ideas or possible ways of addressing a problem a la Ti-Ne, but they are less apt to come to a firm conclusion about what is happening or what should be done.   Also, Yukinoshita's ideal of helping people help themselves.   INTPs, by contrast, focus first on understanding and improving themselves (Ti) and, in the process, hope to provide a roadmap for others to do the same (Fe)."
OreGairuSNAFU,361sei,Lonaticus,3,Fri May 15 14:32:23 2015 UTC,"What a nice observation. What about Yui? I feel as though she could be an ENFJ, but that's just because I feel she's so compatible with 8man and everyone else. I'm much more sceptic on this due to me only knowing an ENFJ very well and not many other types.  Iroha is an interesting character and I'd like to watch her further before I start guessing about what she may be."
OreGairuSNAFU,361sei,Lonaticus,4,Fri May 15 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"Iroha a fox. Also, good chemistry with 8man. That's all I can say without spoiling future episodes/volumes. What I like about this series is that even episodic or secondary characters get a bit of development. Though determining personality types is not that easy for some.  Hayato seems to be the ENFJ type, rather that Yui.   ENFJs are warm, engaging, charismatic, persuasive, and talkative. These personality traits contribute to their status as kings and queens of the social realm.   Yui is maybe an ESFP.    ESFPs are fun, active, attractive, and impressive. While generally fun-loving and easy-going (Se). ESFPs are so expressive and giving, always there in a crisis when people need them yet there is a far more emotional side which means that the ESFP can also easily get hurt.   U done goofed 8man!"
OreGairuSNAFU,361sei,TIHNK,3,Fri May 15 15:22:20 2015 UTC,"You're right. I was pretty certain she was an E and an F. That's about as good as I am at determining those.  I could see that with Hayato, too. I feel as though we're about to see another side of both Hayato and Iroha."
OreGairuSNAFU,361sei,Lonaticus,2,Fri May 15 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"Yukino's an INTJ. She's decisive and domineering, very in charge and entrepreneurial. Also, her dom/aux is def Ni-Te, not Ti-Ne. I don't see much Ti from her, and she's too responsible, serious, and prompt to be a perceiver. In my experience, INTP's are generally pretty warm or at least aloof on the surface. INTJs tend to be more externally cold, rigid, or stoic. This show DOES have an INTP though, and it's Hachiman.  Sure, INFP is a nice guess, but INFPs don't typically engage in the kind of toe stepping and self-aggrandizing Hikki does regularly. Not to mention. INFPs are one of the most emotional of all types and want desperately to share their feelings. You could argue that Hikki does want to share his feelings but due to his experiences in the past, he won't, but I digress. Also, his refusal to accept help from anyone DEFINITELY stems from underdeveloped or damaged Fi, the function that has to do with values, beliefs, and worthiness (the last function for INTPs, by the way).  INFP's last function is introverted thinking (Ti), and Hachiman is far too adept at that for me to peg him as an INFP. Besides, Hachiman has been demonstrating Fe on a regular basis, ever since the first episode of the show, people. All in all, Hachiman is not an INFP. One letter makes all the difference when it comes to people's functions, and Hachiman's thoughts, beliefs, essence and actions align more neatly with the INTP function tree.  I agree with Yui being an ESFP. The rest all need more development before I can weigh in on them."

Good detail and no paint spill.   This Yui looks good. Not amazing, but good enough. Hopefully GSC might make some nendos. I really want an 8man one.  For Iroha, I don't expect we'll get a figure yet. Perhaps there will be demand enough after s2 ends or if vol 10.5 gets animated.

OreGairuSNAFU,35eyf1,APassiveVoice,5,Sat May 9 18:33:44 2015 UTC,I remember the author stating that he doesn't want it to end like most romantic comedies so we will see what that means. Whether good or bad.

Friendships change (in real life and in this anime/LN), and when it does, avoiding it can be harmful to your relationships, in my opinion."
OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,Black_Frost88,11,Sat May 9 11:28:41 2015 UTC,the odds are sadly very low because yukino is most likely going to end up with 8man

OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,Soli18,8,Sun Jun 7 05:25:57 2015 UTC,"At this point nothing is certain. Even for LN readers.  For example look at Iroha. She started as a plot device, then slowly grew from there. Now in the anime she's more like a secondary character and looks like her growth hasn't ended yet.  Then look at Yui. She's still part of the main cast, but just barely. While she still influences and moves the plot, you can feel her presence diminishing. Right now her and Iroha's roles are quite similar. She got a lot of screentime recently, but her relationship with 8man did not advance one bit, despite all of her efforts.  So I'd say even for anime watchers, the main heroine at this point seems to be Yukinoshita. That might change though,  who knows? Mind you, this is a pretty consistent story which tends to cover plot holes or make references to past events  (think Hayato's summer camp confession).   I tried avoiding spoilers and only refered to events up to ep 6. Pls message if you think I added spoilers and I'll remove them."
OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,Lonaticus,5,Sat May 9 13:41:33 2015 UTC,At this point nothing is certain   Gives me glimpse of hope  Hopefully yui makes the comeback

OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,asianedy,4,Sat May 9 15:57:05 2015 UTC,How do you mean they are ''Perfect'' together? They don't even have chemistry? 8man clearly has no romantic feelings for her.   Edit: I think even Isshiki has more chance than Yui.
OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,Soli18,7,Sat May 9 12:26:58 2015 UTC,"Im an anime fag. I find the small interactions between hachiman and yui are cute. Yui gave multiple hints for hachiman but he's too baka to notice them  Isn't Isshiki treated entirely like hachiman's sister?  also i just read online, the author hinted that he doesn't want the series to end like every othe love comedy. The chance for Yui end is so slim :'("
OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,asianedy,8,Sat May 9 12:55:35 2015 UTC,Hachiman is not as oblivious as you might be thinking.  EDIT: this is much more clear in the novels
OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,Soli18,7,Sat May 9 12:57:40 2015 UTC,I understand that you find the interactions cute but establishing a relationship isn't about cute things. :p   I like Yui too but to be together with 8Man just doesn't make sense in my opinion.
OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,asianedy,2,Sat May 9 12:57:33 2015 UTC,Please elaborate. I think the whole opposites thing works pretty well.
OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,Soli18,1 point,Sat May 9 15:45:11 2015 UTC,Well it's true that opposites attract BUT let's take a look at reality since this anime is pretty based on IRL right?  A total nerd on school and the most popular girl in school. They are completely the opposite of each other YET they don't have an attraction right?  So what I want to say is of course opposites attract but they need to have some similarities too and that's why I think 8Man and Yui just doesn't workout.  This is just my opinion.
OreGairuSNAFU,35dwjn,asianedy,3,Sat May 9 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"Yui isn't at the top of the foodchain. And I don't know what world you live in, but this is no where near real life. There is no way a life can have this much drama."

OreGairuSNAFU,35dgta,APassiveVoice,5,Mon May 11 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"Ohh boy, here we go! Full throttle romance!  The synopsis is pretty ambiguous. What I could gather from it is:   The tension! Looks like.   ""Even if you look away from what's genuine, it might be better if this time could continue forever..."" Whose thoughts are this exactly? Obvious answer would be, but then again, maybe someone else wants to preserve the status quo now? Maybe it's? We could get more memorandum chapters like in Vol 10, with an anonymous narrator.  ""Her consultation and her request"". Another ambiguous line. I'll start with the one who's the most unlikely,. Second person could be. But I think most likely it's.  Change, yes, finally. You can't keep the status quo anymore 8man, especially after that talk.   There are still a couple of unanswered questions. There is no mention about the."
OreGairuSNAFU,35dgta,colorbliu,3,Sat May 9 07:25:52 2015 UTC,"That sounds ominous.  It was a safe bet that there'd be some pretty significant drama around Valentines and all, but this seems to imply that awkwardness in the club is going to continue to be a problem even now that they've started to put their real feelings on the table.  ""A slight sense of discomfort that becomes harder to ignore.. can't be played off with the excuse of... not being used to [it].""  Given the context (Valentine's) that almost has to be talking about romance.  So at least one person is making a big play for the 8bowl here and nobody's going to sit back and accept 8man dithering about and pretending not to notice the situation, given>  ""It might be better if this time could continue on forever""  ""It might be better not to notice anything..."" Okay, so maybe it's not so much that they're going to challenge him to take a stand one way or another directly, so much as it's something that he wishes he could still avoid having to do.  A proposal: ""Her consultation and her request.""  Huh.  Well, that could be referring to Isshiki above - it seems her request is going to be central to the plot (for a record-breaking three main-volumes in a row), but is this necessarily just restating the obvious, or a reference to somebody else's request (Yukino?)?"
OreGairuSNAFU,35dgta,Yamigosaya,3,Sat May 9 07:28:28 2015 UTC,"Welp. Looks like we're going full Yukino, boys. Can't say that I don't like it but I still believe Sakisaki can pull through, r-right guys."

OreGairuSNAFU,35ao16,Cult_films,2,Fri May 8 14:54:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, it definitely looks better here  Nice work"

OreGairuSNAFU,35ayft,4kura,2,Fri May 8 16:17:20 2015 UTC,Start from volume 1 chapter 1. The latest volume is 10 unless you count 10.5 which is a side volume. Volume 11 comes out in June.
OreGairuSNAFU,35ayft,guyofred,2,Fri May 8 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that all of novels are great but if your confused I would go back to where the second season starts, from volume 7. Covering 6 volumes can be quite the task so i started from volume 7, got caught up, then went back to volume 1 and started reading."
OreGairuSNAFU,35ayft,APassiveVoice,1 point,Fri May 8 17:59:47 2015 UTC,Start from the beginning  Links to LN translations are on the sidebar
OreGairuSNAFU,35ayft,Cult_films,3,Fri May 8 16:19:54 2015 UTC,The LN is sooooo good. I'm typically the person who hates only text stories(books) but holy shit is the light novel good.
OreGairuSNAFU,359u09,Cult_films,7,Fri May 8 08:56:35 2015 UTC,"Seems this week we get an Iroha Epepisode. though they did left a some elements from the LNm they didn't fail on picturing Iro and 8man's interactions.   not much yukinon action going on but you can tell something is up with it, we might get some closure in the next episode but it seems it will also be about iroha and the SCC.   also the return of Orimoto was expected, she was still her usual self which i thought would change after that incident with Hayama.  also you can tell where all them animation budget went, JUST LOOK AT THEM HANDMOVEMENTS."
OreGairuSNAFU,359u09,Yamigosaya,3,Fri May 8 11:39:54 2015 UTC,I would be surprised if she actually changed. That's just how people are. Most anime (mostly shonen) use an event to mark a turning between where the character changes. Oregairu does nothing of that which I applaud.

OreGairuSNAFU,359u09,Lost_Strangereal,5,Fri May 8 15:13:09 2015 UTC,"Shippers see what they want to see.  Objectively speaking, sly Iroha is the one who's been racking up the most 8points lately.  Just enjoy the ride.  They're all getting good scenes going forward."
OreGairuSNAFU,359u09,socalso,3,Sat May 9 07:37:28 2015 UTC,"I hope I will see more Yukinon soon like everyone keep telling me, because we only had 1 episode of her and the rest just like seconds or few minutes per episode and it's bothering me."
OreGairuSNAFU,359u09,paladinmahdi,5,Fri May 8 09:01:02 2015 UTC,"Just look at her! She's in pain. She is trying to bear with the situation, as you can see from her resigned look. Feel did a great job with her facial expressions this episode.   At this point reading the LN or spoilers of it will only break your immersion. Won't spoil it for you, just bear with it. Ignore the LN reader's hype for future episodes."
OreGairuSNAFU,359u09,Lonaticus,3,Fri May 8 10:56:49 2015 UTC,"I will be reading it after this season, I will bear with it and I hope I will not be disappointed, I just need more Yukino."
OreGairuSNAFU,359u09,paladinmahdi,4,Fri May 8 15:44:39 2015 UTC,Iroha is keeping things interesting. Idk Yui and Yukino have been feeling dull since this season started.

OreGairuSNAFU,359u09,AlienWarhead,4,Sat May 9 17:13:57 2015 UTC,Nope. He was mocking Iroha's fake cutesy voice again like last week.

OreGairuSNAFU,357qkn,angel10701,10,Thu May 7 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"His hand movements really pissed me off. Actually the rest of the Kaihin Sogo students looked infuriating, too."
OreGairuSNAFU,357qkn,guyofred,8,Thu May 7 20:48:52 2015 UTC,The hand movements there are actually really fuckin scary. It doesn't even look like his hands are attached to his body.
OreGairuSNAFU,357qkn,KaiHighInTheSky,6,Fri May 8 00:20:00 2015 UTC,They looped the movements so much it looked mechanical and just unnatural and off. I'm pretty this guy is a cyborg along with everyone else on the student council.
OreGairuSNAFU,357qkn,guyofred,5,Fri May 8 02:08:41 2015 UTC,Dude..... He just won't stop moving his hands ... Oh the terror  Someone tape his hands to the table or something.... I think we can still save him before it's too late....
OreGairuSNAFU,357qkn,KitKatxz,5,Fri May 8 06:59:06 2015 UTC,"I know right???? He was very irritating in the LNs as it is with his synergy and collaboration and win-win and the brainstorming, but somehow the anime found a way to make him more irritating.   He does need professional help.  Maybe we can try by punching him in the face, then in the neck and then going further down if that doesn't solve the issue either."
OreGairuSNAFU,357qkn,chitoge4ever,5,Fri May 8 13:07:28 2015 UTC,So that's where all the budget went into.

OreGairuSNAFU,3571ur,Fruitsy,3,Thu May 7 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"He could always pull a Haganai. But what I think most likely will happen is Yui Seems a bit cliche, but it fits.  Edit: Cleaned up spoiler tags (sorry)."
OreGairuSNAFU,3571ur,Lonaticus,3,Thu May 7 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"The Haganai ending would be him getting with someone else besides the 2 main girls. I just think its silly to expect a clean romance ending for any girl; even if the thing you guys mentions happens (but with a happier result and no suffering), there's still the elephant in the room of Yukino and her reaction so.....  Finally, I just dont see our protag going Y/N willy nilly without contemplating it over several chapters"
OreGairuSNAFU,3571ur,asianedy,5,Thu May 7 20:20:47 2015 UTC,The Haganai ending would mean  is the winner. I just hope Wataru sensei gives us the ending he wanted and doesn't succumb to fatigue or fan pressure like Oreimo.  Edit: Cleaned up spoiler tags (sorry).

OreGairuSNAFU,34szmt,gintoki1,5,Mon May 4 08:41:51 2015 UTC,"What I don't get though is why did Yui and Yukinon simply agree and think the issue was solved after seeing the list of people who support Iroha?    Yukino was running to prevent Iroha from becoming president. Yui was running to prevent Yukino from becoming president. Hachiman didn't want either as president. By convincing Iroha to accept being president, he basically annulled the request itself - in his opinion there now should no longer be a reason for Yukino to run, and without Yukino running there is no reason for Yui to run."
OreGairuSNAFU,34szmt,Taiboss,7,Mon May 4 09:58:34 2015 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/OreGairuSNAFU/comments/34pjnw/spoilers_can_someone_explain_something_to_me_from/  should answer all your question  but ill try to simplify it   yes, he made fake accounts under actually popular names, swapped their names to iroha for as long as the effect would last (before people realize the name's swapped), then used the online signature/vouch list as proof. it was a two-handed tactic, which if both iroha and yui/yukino were to sit down and chat about, they would point fingers at hachiman for being cheap and dishonorable so yui actually had an idea of what hachiman did, thats why if u recall she subtly motioned her hand on her cellphone, yui being yui she would be update with the latest buzz, which probably includes twitter, and at one point im sure she came by one of the grassroots twitter accounts. however, yui also being yui and wanting to return the club to its former state of tranquility between the three, sort of ""let it go"" and decided not to inquire further.   before i go on about yukino, i want to emphasize that the LN does a lot more in-depth explanations while the anime touches upon them with emphasis on the body language and expressions. thus, without foreknowledge of what's actually described in the light novels, the anime makes it somewhat difficult to connect the dots fluently. however rushed the anime may be in comparison, the subtleties are what make this show the beast that it is.  with that said, yukino's part is simple, just like the misunderstandings back in s1 with hachiman&yukino, just like the drama with the field trip confession a few episodes ago, the two of them have difficulties expressing themselves to each other - and the times they do in their own ways, they have a mutual understanding and acknowledgement, as often times their resolutions defy their common enemy - deception and superficial things, fronts put up by people.   why that is relevant is because of the last words spoken this episode, the title of the episode, and yukino's basically last words.   last words of this episode - what if you could rewind to the past? can you change what you did? the answer is a resounding no  episode title - the scent of tea was no longer in the room  and most importantly, yukino's last words - 'i thought for sure that you would understand..""  this was said after hachiman explained to yui and yukino that the way they approached this request from the start was wrong, and that he removed the shackles (the things that held isshiki back from desiring presidency which he convinced her out of) which suppressed her desires - rather he took the minuses of presidency for isshiki and turned them into positives (library negotiation scene).   yukinon sealed the deal when she said ""so theres no longer a problem for me to act on anymore"", signalling her 'defeat' or at least acknowledging there is no longer a request from isshiki to deal with. yes, in some ways it doesn't seem to be direct clarification as she never consulted isshiki about it, but when u see 400 signatures from the student body infront of you along with hachiman's new tone/method (in the LN they emphasize that he spoke in a different manner, they way he admitted to abandoning his old recommendation of botching the campaign speech by saying ""im done with that sh**"" according to commie subs), there isn't much room for confrontation nor consultation.  edit: sorry for the long reply im a sucker for this series"
OreGairuSNAFU,34szmt,Inori92,6,Mon May 4 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was dealt with more explicitly in the novel, but I think we can at least infer that 8man showing up with 200 signatories like that, written in Iroha's own hand, would indicate that he'd already persuaded her to abandon her request and take on the election.  edit: One detail omitted from the adaptation - both Yukino and Yui had been struggling to get the 30 endorsements they'd need, because 8man's twitter campaign made people hesitant to make that commitment.  It wasn't a matter of them deciding to fight it out; at that point they still weren't eligible to go to the ballot."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,LadWatcherIsHere,4,Sun May 3 19:58:22 2015 UTC,"Her role in the narrative is, at times, quite passive, admittedly. I suspect that others will argue for the importance of her function therein, so I will touch on a slightly different topic: her characterization. I think that one could levy that she has received the least amount of development out of any of the main characters—or even side characters. We still know very little about her. She hints at great secrets and labyrinths stored within both her past and current situation, yet we rarely see any useful embellishment. The novels certainly shift some of their weight onto her character later in the series, but she, at this point in the game, seems somewhat pale.  I imagine that some might argue that she is a show-don't-tell character, requiring us to read closely into her actions in order to discern her character, and I think that this is a fair argument. However, we must admit that, at times, she is entirely a ""tell"" character. This normally happens when Yukino and 8man are alone together, and Yukino hints very strongly at some unnameable grief. Yukino is developed only through questions and not answers, and, unfortunately, all of the questions seem to stem from a single event in her past. As soon as we understand that event, we understand Yukino—and that is why I, too, am afraid that she will (continue to) be a weak character."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,sonanddeath,6,Sun May 3 21:55:04 2015 UTC,"All of the contradictions they point out can be resolved simply enough - Yukino is, under the surface, as deeply flawed as anybody else.  She only looks perfect, and a big part of the problems these characters start to have is that they're pedestalizing each other instead of being able to deal with each other and themselves more honestly.  8man and Yukino both profess lofty ideals.  They both fail to live up to them, and this puts a strain on the relationships they have... right up until spoiler  It seems more than a little confused to describe these as flaws in the writing itself.  If Yukino actually lived up to her ideals 100% of the time, she'd be a very boring character.  The ""perfect"" characters in this series are all cast as villains (or at least as rivals), and while 8man and Yukino strive for perfection themselves, they reject the models of perfection they have in their lives - Hayato and Haruno, respectively.  They can argue that she's 2-dimensional all they want, but the story is ongoing and it's premature to be saying that.  Maybe in the end we'll get a cop-out ending to prove their point.  I've got a little bit more faith in the author than that - he's earned a little bit of trust that he knows what he's doing, I feel.  As far as who ""deserves"" 8man more?  Have at it.  I think Yukino and Yui are both great characters and there's no wrong choice to be made there (at least between the two of them - some of the other love interests would definitely be bad choices).  As for 8man, as a character, he's got plenty of growing to do before he'd be a prize for either of them, regardless of their merits.  At the bare minimum, it would be a punishment to either of these girls to fall in love with somebody so lacking in self-worth (and by implication, filled with self-loathing, despite his usual overblown praise of himself).  That's not a comment on what the ideal ending would be; I'm just saying, it's jumping the gun a little bit to be talking about which outcome would be best/worst at this point in the story.  We still don't know Yukino, really, and 8man is only barely demonstrating the capacity for reciprocity that he'd need to be anything other than a loner.  Yui seems to be the most developed of the three in that sense, but she's got her own battles to deal with."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,socalso,7,Mon May 4 08:50:10 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on all characters in this series are that every character in this series is underdeveloped. The LN has a tonal shift around Vol 7 where there is a lot less 8man introspection and a lot more character interaction and I'm not surprised at all at the number of superficial events the anime cuts out (1st season covered Vol 1-6).  Let me describe LN 8man before I describe Yukino. 8man as a child wasn't invited to hangout with the kids his age. He was bullied for his interests in manga and isolated because of his looks and personality. He never developed the social skills to interact with people so his defense mechanism is to just not associate with others. This is where LN 8man and Anime 8man part ways. LN 8man is always preoccupied with girls/Totsuka. He is afraid of getting close to them because of what happened with Orimoto Kaori. He constantly acknowledges how pretty Yukino is, how ""easy on the eyes"" Iroha is, and how endowed Yui is. Anime 8man seems to be, for the most part, apathetic to these things. This is one of the unfortunate things that were cut from the anime script. That is, a dive into the mind of the MC.  Yukino herself is as flawed as 8man. We really don't know much about her past. What is her relationship with Hayama or even her family? She was brought up to be perfect in all regards, but in reality she doesn't have much confidence in herself. Her defense mechanism against failure is to not try at all.  Spoiler V9 Ch 5 Is this consistent with the events she's done so far? I don't think that matters. One of the ways the LN and anime have failed in story telling is convincing readers that Spoiler   We know from the start that she has had the 8man love flags around her events. The real question people should be about her involvement with 8man's car accident and whether this motivated her to have Hiratsuka-sensei force 8man into the service club."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,colorbliu,3,Sun May 3 21:47:48 2015 UTC,"I like the way you think. It's the first thing that my literature teacher told me: If you read a book and then go to see the adaptation you're gonna end up severely disappointed.  One of the things I seriously like about 8man are his inner thoughts. The way he describes the girl, the jokes he makes, everything of that is really entertaining but sadly those are cut off in the anime. Understandable, but still... And yeah, due to the fact that this is told from 8man's POV, then, it's hard to get any solid conclusions about the way Yukino acts based on speculation. Either she or someone else explains it to 8man or the readers/audience will never understand it."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,DaniSenpai,3,Sun May 3 21:54:38 2015 UTC,"To be honest the second season seems to be better at showing Hachiman's emotions and thought, still, the adaptation's fine enough that it maintains all of the story aspects intact, while only skipping (or at least so far, since I'm not up to date with it yet) scenes that, even though would be good to see animated, wouldn't change the outcome of the story itself."

OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,halfyoshi,10,Sun May 3 22:07:38 2015 UTC,"exactly. The reason I'm not a Yukino fan is because it seems to me that they are waiting to reveal the big event in her past that made her who she is, which has left me not caring too much about her, while Yui just keeps getting better."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,DaniSenpai,3,Mon May 4 01:47:38 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about who I want to have the ""happy ending"" here, although Yui has worked hard since the beginning, Yukino also had to deal with rough situations herself."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,halfyoshi,10,Mon May 4 02:48:07 2015 UTC,"To me it feels like for the happy ending with 8man, Yui deserves it way more. considering how much she has tried to get 8man to see that she likes him and how much she has done in their relationship. While as Yukino is just a bitch to 8man. If she wins the 8bowl it will disappoint me and it would just a fcked up thing to do to Yui considering how much she has tried to show her feelings to 8man. Not that I dislike her or anything, but I just thin Yui deserves it more."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,DaniSenpai,2,Mon May 4 02:57:51 2015 UTC,"That depends whether or not the story takes a more romcom-like path, can't think of a specific name right now, but it's not weird for the character that never did a thing but was designed as that one ""nobody understands me I must suffah"" to be the fan favorite and end up with the happy ending.   Edit: this could be a little bias, but  Oreimo spoiler."

OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,DaniSenpai,2,Mon May 4 16:09:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but what I mean is, much effort doesn't necessarily equal a happy ending."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,Fruitsy,2,Mon May 4 16:19:57 2015 UTC,I never understood the deserving arguments when it come to shipwars. Can't 8man just end up with the girl he likes the most?
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,halfyoshi,2,Mon May 4 16:26:49 2015 UTC,"Well for me since I like Yui more I want her to win. If 8man ends up with Yukino at the end I'll be totally fine with it, just as long as Yui is ok and they don't hurt her feelings. I view it as ""I like this character so I want them to be happy"" sort of thing."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,Jiraex,2,Mon May 4 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of generalizing and they don't seem to understand why specific things happen when it comes to Yukino. And I can't take them seriously if they think Yukino has no role in changing Hachiman since she's the main factor in it. The second season should be more than enough evidence.  And if they think Yukino is a bad character, then so is everyone else since the only one doing anything is Hachiman."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,Jiraex,4,Sun May 3 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with your points. You say Yukino is the main factor for changing 8man but so far he's been acting like the same 8man we all know and love with the only difference being that his own group of friends is increasing, he's showing to be more comfortable around the main girls and doesn't become a coward anymore when facing people like Yumiko. But most of that was done by 8man himself, not because of Yukino.  And who's generalizing now? Yukino is a main character and a main character is the one that moves the plot. Secondary characters like Zaimokuza are not bad just because they don't really add much since that's the purpose of their characters. The main character moves the secondary ones but the only one moving something is 8man, not Yukino."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,DaniSenpai,2,Sun May 3 21:42:05 2015 UTC,"But Yukino did move the plot, and that was confronting Hachiman's entire shtick in solving things. It's because the narrative is so heavily biased in favor of Hachiman that we never really get her side of the story.  I say Yukino's the main factor because she's the one that ultimately leads to him questioning himself on a fundamental level. Otherwise, he would've just kept living his life in his own shell lying to himself about what he wants. Yui's also important too, but I feel Yukino's the bigger reason why he goes through the changes he does in volumes 7-9, advice from third parties not withstanding. In the same way Hachiman is the biggest factor in Yukino's change, the opposite holds true. That's how I see it. And this is in consideration of volume 10 as well. Contrast this volume with 5 and see how different his attitude is towards Yukino.  Though, I do find it frustrating that Yukino's basically put in a negative light for the entire series, so she may not seem as compelling as other characters. Because again, the narrative is heavily biased towards Hachiman. Probably my biggest complaint regarding the series, honestly.  A book centering around Yukino's POV would be a godsend for this series."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,DaniSenpai,1 point,Mon May 4 20:58:57 2015 UTC,"Tell me about it. I loved it when the POV was switched to the other male character in High School DxD. It felt like a huge change because after more than 10 volumes of only reading a single character's inner thoughts, that change felt so refreshing.  A Yukinon spin off would be great. Even if it's just a comedy 4-koma."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,wickedfighting,3,Tue May 5 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to argue whether or not Yukino is the main factor for Hachiman's change, but he's not the same, the fact that his group has increased has changed him, the interactions he's been forced to have for being in the Service Club have changed him, think about it, would early Hachiman care about Hayama's reasons to ask him to go out with him and Orimoto? Would he have tried to save the Service Club (that he despised and was only there because, as I said, he was forced to)?   The fact that he cared about his relationship with Yui and Yukino, as well for his own sister, shows that he now has started to open himself to the world that he once rejected and, even though he doesn't explicitly admits it, he has started to live normal teenage life, ""enjoying his youth""."
OreGairuSNAFU,34qx7y,nsleep,3,Mon May 4 00:09:26 2015 UTC,"Certainly she's not the main factor but still has things to add when it comes to 8man's changes which is indeed happening. Still, most of these points are based on a critic on how Yukino moves.... not the plot, I say we should call it problems that she as the President of the Service Club has to deal with which is almost nothing. And if we take in consideration the last few volumes of the novel then"

He did this to show Iroha that people actually want her to be the president. He then showed the names of the people backing Iroha to Yukinoshita and Yuigahama to get them to drop off the race.  The vote of no confidence is when you only have one nominee they have to garner a certain amount of votes for them to be elected as president.  Hope I answered your question :D
OreGairuSNAFU,34pjnw,JVSenador,3,Sun May 3 12:25:43 2015 UTC,"to add on the certain number of votes is 30 i believe which is just enough to have you qualify as a runner/candidate, i believe op's a little confused similarly to how i was because twitter follows usually don't translate to actual votes when the time comes and the name of the ballot changes.  basically, hachiman pulled a fast one, iroha probably didn't get votes of the 1/3 of the student body as hachiman had proposed she had the backing of, but he put up a front through his crafty method which was enough for yukinoshita and yuigahama to pull out of the race. then the vote of no confidence (terrible use of the translation imo, the actual definition of vote of no confidence is like the opposite where u vacate the incumbent i think) ensued, which allows iroha to win if she has the # of nominations simply to run, because there were no other opponents.  edit: yui knew about it and touched her cellphone which freaked out hachiman a bit, but she decided to let it go, you can understand if u follow the succeeding dialogue with her and hachiman, how she says he probably used a cheap tactic (she knows about the twitter stuff, she's yui shes a social hub herself), but managed to save them again. yukinoshita probably didn't, she's a loner and doesn't socialize via twitter n stuff, but her words obviously call out hachiman in her own way as they still have the personal differences thing going on regarding superficiality and resolving methods.  SWEET BABY JESUS I LOVE THIS SHOW"
OreGairuSNAFU,34pjnw,Inori92,3,Sun May 3 15:53:20 2015 UTC,That was a necessary edit. I didn't get what happened either but that moment really showed with so little facial expressions that Yui somehow figured things out and 8man was scared that she might talk but let it go because regardless of the method he still saved the club and that's all Yui wanted.

But I would still wait till after you read Volume 9 because some of the character dynamics would be a little confusing. It isn't  exactly crucial to the story but it's quite fun and shows some great character/plot development. Also as for where it is, go on kyakka, after volume 6 there is one for 6.5. I don't have the desktop version up but there should be a ""bonus track"" tab under 6.5. Click that and you get to the material to read."

OreGairuSNAFU,34hwww,guyofred,4,Fri May 1 15:20:39 2015 UTC,What is in volume 9? I'm too lazy to read it yet and just dying to know.
OreGairuSNAFU,34hwww,NagisaK,3,Sat May 2 08:26:21 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about it a bit to argue why it might be 3 episodes given what they did for volume 8 but I think you're right. We know this is a single cour so it has to be 12-13 episodes (unless they pull one on us and say it's 10 >.>) So assuming that, we'd finish volume 9 by episode 9 at the end of the 4 episodes. It gives exactly 3 episodes to fit in vol 10 maybe 4. Unless they do the same thing as season 1 and finish vol 10 in 2 episodes and give the last episode as something original or a .5 chapter"
OreGairuSNAFU,34hwww,CrazystuffIsee,6,Sat May 2 17:21:33 2015 UTC,I only just noticed that they've been changing the opening slightly every episode since episode 3...
OreGairuSNAFU,34hwww,Foolish_Professional,4,Fri May 1 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"""And here I was sure you'd understand,"" following, ""So there's no longer a problem, or a reason for me to act.""  What did Yukino means with this ?"
OreGairuSNAFU,34hwww,paladinmahdi,7,Fri May 1 13:10:05 2015 UTC,"The best explanation I got was   The conflict of volume 8 is the issue with what is superficial and what isn't.  Hachiman chose to go against his own principles for the sake of another group's relationship, but this also reflects on his own relationships. Yukino is upset at this.  What exactly is the current relationship that binds the three together? The Service Club and only the Service Club. How genuine is a relationship if the only thing holding them together is a simple title?  Now we look at Yukino. She wants or is seeking for something beyond that. So she decides to run for president and this isn't just because Haruno egged her on nor was it only because of Hachiman's plan to kill himself socially. She wanted to do it herself personally. This means the club will have to disband.  But should that really matter?  She wanted the both of them, at the very least, Hachiman, to understand this. I think it should be self-explanatory after that emphasized quote of hers in chapter 8.   /u/Jiraex"
OreGairuSNAFU,34hwww,guyofred,3,Fri May 1 17:38:10 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. Everything in place now.
OreGairuSNAFU,34hwww,paladinmahdi,6,Fri May 1 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"There was also something a bit more. Speculative, of course, but logical.  Yukino knew that if/when she won presidency, the club would've been disbanded. She knew that for a fact, and still decided to go for it anyway. Why? Because of superficiality. Yukino knew that if Yui and Hachiman and her were truly friends, the club disbanding wouldn't have ruined their friendship at all.   Later in the episode, when the old president is moving out, she tells Hachiman that she was hoping Yukino would've succeeded her, and she imagined that Yukino, Yui, and Hachiman would've all still been together in the student council rather than another outcome that would leave them all alone.   Yukino believed that friendship would've won out. Yui was conflicted, but true to her feelings as well. Hachiman, unknowingly lying to himself or wanting to remain safe, made the choice to not test anything at all."
OreGairuSNAFU,34hwww,NeverEndingHope,4,Fri May 1 19:08:21 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really able to enjoy this episode I think I'm mad at myself for not being to understand or enjoy this anime as much as everyone else. I enjoyed some parts like with the talk with Yui and 8man, but this series is hard for me to follow, I had no idea who 8man was talking to at the end. I know should try the light novels it's just that my feelings for this series are mixed and I wouldn't be into reading it. I won't be able to use the internet for several months starting May 11th because of work and afterwards I won't have a lot of free time so it's going to be hard to get back into series. Sorry I'm being negative again, but I like talking about my feelings on reddit, it helps sometimes and I never felt comfortable doing this on other websites."

OreGairuSNAFU,340bdo,Izzy1UP,3,Mon Apr 27 07:55:34 2015 UTC,The LN has 10 volumes at the moment and season two starts at volume 7. But the anime cuts out a lot of things from the novels so if you want to start you should begin at volume 1.
OreGairuSNAFU,340bdo,kethxenn,3,Mon Apr 27 08:04:35 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! I just found a translation online. I hope on day it can get licensed so i can properly support the series.
OreGairuSNAFU,340bdo,socalso,4,Mon Apr 27 15:20:21 2015 UTC,"Buy official merch when you can.  Show that there's a market in your country to justify the localization effort.  Even so, localization of popular authors in Japan is always a crapshoot.  Nisioisin still hasn't had a successful launch in America even though he was at the height of his popularity a few years ago (only two of the Zaregoto books ever got officially released in America, and they got zero marketing and rapidly ended up in the bargain bin).  These days we see a lot of series that should be niche getting launched over here while things that seem like no-brainers languish in the fansubs.  I don't think even Haruhi sold well... but the market was different a couple years ago.  I think something of that level of popularity coming out today would be much more successful, at least in the ebook market."
OreGairuSNAFU,340bdo,socalso,2,Mon Apr 27 20:24:47 2015 UTC,I live in America so Anime is a funny topics when it comes too localization. The dumbest series could get localized while masterpieces are put on back burners. Whenever some stuff is available definitely ill pick it up!!
OreGairuSNAFU,340bdo,Yamulo,4,Mon Apr 27 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"Me too.  Sometimes, timing is everything.  I bet if they'd started with Bakemonogatari instead of Zaregoto to trade off of the name-brand recognition of that series, Zaregoto could have had a chance at riding on Nisioisin's more well-known work.  Then again, sometimes it's just a lot of hard work to move over certain series.  Something that you'd think would be difficult because it's material is esoteric - fantasy, sci-fi, whatever - ends up being easy because there isn't necessarily much nuance to the style the author's of those works write in.  Zaregoto, Oregairu - their settings are comparatively banal, but there's probably a lot more word-play and referential humor going on in these than something like, say, Danmachi.  That could be a factor, too."
OreGairuSNAFU,340bdo,socalso,3,Mon Apr 27 23:44:35 2015 UTC,So TRUE. I found t shirts online so maybe that will lead to better things in the future.
OreGairuSNAFU,340bdo,Yamulo,2,Tue Apr 28 00:26:52 2015 UTC,How does one go about getting official merch?
OreGairuSNAFU,340bdo,haugao,4,Tue Apr 28 03:13:31 2015 UTC,"Amazon Japan, CDJapan - pretty much any store-front that isn't a secondary-market (e.g. ebay).  Even if you don't read moon, buying the books might help show there's interest in getting them translated (not like you didn't get your money's worth out of the fan translations anyways; Spyro from Kyakka makes the same recommendation).  I think that was a factor in Watamote getting localized - of all people, Anon spoke with their wallets and actually bought stuff.  That, and the memetic popularity of Tomoko..."
OreGairuSNAFU,33x6k8,Cult_films,8,Sun Apr 26 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"I'll have to admit, I actually like Commie's better for this scene."
OreGairuSNAFU,33x6k8,asianedy,9,Sun Apr 26 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"Right. Even with my pretty slim knowledge of japanese, I could tell watching the livestream that ""Suki nano"" can refer to both the club and Hachiman himself.  Sometimes, Crunchyroll translators abiding to existing fan translations has its downsides."
OreGairuSNAFU,33x6k8,Taiboss,4,Sun Apr 26 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"That's just one of the pitfalls of Japanese-to-English translation.  They can say things in certain ways that don't have direct or ""best"" translations in English.  English can't cope with a phrase with ambiguous grammatical subjects or objects, so in translation we have to say something to make the sentence work.  Commie's translation was a good compromise - ""I'm in love"" - but in order to do that, they had to have the somewhat odd ""I'm in love with this club.""  Crunchyroll's translation is safer but lacks the punch of that indirect confession in the end.  In the end, either choice is defensible.  edit:  I doubt they had this in mind, but Crunchyroll's ""I like... it"" could actually have been a clever callback to the fact that Yukino used to always talk about 8man as though he weren't human.  If they put ""it"" in quotes, that could have helped preserve the unambiguous double-meaning, instead of simply inserting ""it"" as an arbitrary grammatical object in the sentence."
OreGairuSNAFU,33x6k8,socalso,5,Sun Apr 26 19:23:26 2015 UTC,"I think that ""I'm in love with this club."" still sounded normal enough, and once the ""I'm in love."" came, it all made a lot more sense. By itself, ""I'm in love with this club."" is definitely a bit weird, but it really worked as a pair."
OreGairuSNAFU,33x6k8,SNEAKY_AGENT_URKEL,3,Mon Apr 27 03:50:35 2015 UTC,"It does.  I didn't mean to imply that it was out of place in the context.  It's a little bit more emphatic than to say ""I like this club,"" that's for sure.  In a sense, she's just saying what the other two don't have the courage to try to articulate for themselves - they're all ""in love with the club,"" and all that implies.  Otherwise, there wouldn't be any reason for them to be so broken up over its fracturing."
OreGairuSNAFU,33x6k8,socalso,3,Mon Apr 27 03:58:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, alright. I agree that Yukinon and 8man seem to not want to admit how much the club means to them.  I feel like Crunchyroll should have gone with something like ""I like it... a lot."" The ellipses to show a pause after ""I"" felt really weird, and obviously the impact was quite terrible."
OreGairuSNAFU,33x6k8,SNEAKY_AGENT_URKEL,3,Mon Apr 27 04:06:06 2015 UTC,"It was their attempt at dealing with the ambiguity of the phrasing and the pause between 好き　and なの in the delivery.  It may be a bit of a misinterpretation of what that pause entailed, though - hence putting it after the ""I"" instead of ""I like.""  Personally, I think it's more a pause for emphasis and that this is obscured by having the ellipsis after the ""I.""  Translation is complicated."

OreGairuSNAFU,33w6ut,Phuqs,7,Sun Apr 26 05:21:26 2015 UTC,"Good question.  Maybe it depends on who you think she wanted to bake those cookies for in the first episode/volume.  She said ""friends,"" but 8man never sees her giving any to her clique - instead, he gets a heart-shaped one.  Then again, she did keep calling him creepy, weird, gross, etc.  We know for sure she was into him by the time they got involved in resolving Kawa-something's family dilemma.  So at some point before then.  Whether she's been holding a torch for him since he saved Sable or that was gratitude evolving into love, I guess you're free to speculate until the novels deal with it more explicitly.  8man's shut her down almost every time she's tried to directly confess to him, so he doesn't really want to know - and if he doesn't want to know, we don't get to know.  Though there have been a few times in the spin-offs where the narrative was actually given from the perspective of other characters (nevermind the ambiguous No Longer Human sections from Volume 10), so I guess that's not impossible for an upcoming .5 either."
OreGairuSNAFU,33w6ut,socalso,3,Sun Apr 26 05:57:44 2015 UTC,Those no longer human sections were so amazing.

OreGairuSNAFU,33w6ut,Yamulo,2,Mon Apr 27 22:48:32 2015 UTC,"something I've been wondering about this, not sure if I should make a thread to ask about it but for now I'll just ask here since its related.  so we know the car accident happened at the beginning of their HIGH SCHOOL, which means the beginning of their freshman year, 10th grade.  but the service club and the request from yui happened in the spring of their SECOND year, or 11th grade.  so isn't it weird that yui only came to ask about making cookies to thank hikki after more than a whole year after the accident? either it was a minor plot hole/inconsistency or the author must be planning to reveal something that happened before the cookies baking incident that triggered yui's decision to make cookies (which is not very likely since that plot was too long ago and already buried)"
OreGairuSNAFU,33w6ut,raizen0106,5,Mon Apr 27 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"It's a fair question to raise.  The easy gloss is to say that Yui's first attempt at contacting him failed because Komachi bogarted all the sweets she gave for 8man and she was discouraged from trying again when he apparently didn't respond to the gesture at all, and it took her that long to build up the courage to try again.  Meeting Yukino is a huge transformative moment for her, after all - she's a weak-willed go-with-the-flow type who's afraid to stand up to her friends until interacting with Yukino and 8man helps her grow a spine.  The other possibility is that she didn't really know who he was and never saw him again through the rest of that year.  We don't have to assume they've been in the same class since first year, after all.  They may not have been.  The start of second year, and seeing him every day, might have spurred her to try again - but not immediately.  We know she was initially put off by his apparent creepiness, if she's being honest with her reactions to him - and again, because she didn't have the courage to stand up to her friends and reach out to somebody who was very clearly socially radioactive.  But that's just a gloss, because the fact is, we don't know what happened during that first year yet.  So that may very well come out sometime over the next few volumes."
OreGairuSNAFU,33w6ut,socalso,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:50:56 2015 UTC,"thx. glad to see someone else also thinks this is a bit strange. of course we can cover it up with easy solutions like the ones you said, or even like my friend who defended this with ""oh she just procrastinated for a year, nothing wrong with it""  imho I'd like to just think that the author made a minor inconsistency, like he chose to put the accident at their highschool entrance day to explain hikki's unpopularity, but then start the story in their 2nd year because it flows better and didn't care to fix it  don't get me wrong tho. I LOVE the author, but it happens to everyone to make some minor inconsistency especially in the early stage of a product. even great manga like one piece or slam dunk had really bad drawing at first too, and only became more refined later  also if you read the first volume, the behaviors of yumiko miura the queen was very much different than her characteristics that were built on in later volumes. and it's not ""character development"" either, since her first conversation flaming yuigahama was totally that of a pretentious shallow bully, not a tsundere motherly figure like she really is  I think that the author didn't develop all the drama we see in later volumes (9 and 10 mainly) right from the beginning, at least not from vol 1. he only decided the characters' backstory later on when all the cast were introduced. it seemed a bit awkward for hayama to cheerfully come to the service club to ask for a small problem solving if he and yukino were on a strained relationship"

OreGairuSNAFU,33w6ut,LadWatcherIsHere,5,Mon Apr 27 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"To /u/socalso and /u/raizen0106. It's been confirmed that the cookies were for 8man all along. This is actually part of the plot during the conflict between 8man and Yui which was foreshadowed by Komachi and Yui herself. The confirmation was this:  Yui: (In the pet clinic) This really can't go on. I need to talk things out. I haven't given him the cookies either  She says all of this while thinking of 8man. How can we know? Because like I said, this happened during the time they had an argument.  And to Phuqs. Yui admires Yukino and loves her tons, all because she's someone Yui can trust unlike her friends who she always has to please like she does with Yumiko almost all the time. The same thing happens with 8man, only that he's a guy so it's normal that as a teenager, she fell for him due to the same reasons she likes Yukino. So I'll say she fell for 8man later on but of course the saving her dog might have looked cool in her eyes so that also helped."

OreGairuSNAFU,33wge3,Taiboss,2,Sun Apr 26 08:20:51 2015 UTC,"I'd agree in principle - I think of the anime as it's own thing, a singular volume with each episode essentially comprising one chapter in the whole, and talking about how it cuts this or that element from the book is somewhat besides the point.  I just finished reading volumes 1-4 last week for the first time so I'm curious about what you think was better left unused."
OreGairuSNAFU,33wge3,socalso,3,Sun Apr 26 09:49:32 2015 UTC,I actually haven't read the first 6 novels (time-constraints) so I am actually only referring to hoping spoiler work
OreGairuSNAFU,33wge3,Taiboss,3,Sun Apr 26 09:56:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah.  Good call on that one.  Though it's only Spoiler.  It's a funny scene, but at that point in the story Zaimokuza's a pretty aggravating character.  In hindsight though, it does establish a nice arc for him.  He doesn't really change from being wishy-washy, but we do see that he has some redeeming qualities later on - Volume 8 we'll see next week, but the big one is Volume 10, where he has a really nice moment where he shows that he's actually a surprisingly loyal guy.  Specifically  Like a lot of things, I missed that on the first read-through and it stood out to me the second time.  There was a thread a week ago or so where somebody asked what the point of his character was and why he's even around.  To me, that justifies his existence in these stories in a big way."

OreGairuSNAFU,33wge3,Cult_films,3,Sun Apr 26 09:53:02 2015 UTC,Episode 4 covered only 2 chapters so this should be fine. And yes you did miss a lot. The strip poker thing was kinda silly but yeah you missed a lot of shit. Also nice to see another man with good taste.
OreGairuSNAFU,33sqqr,ulfserkr,3,Sat Apr 25 06:48:49 2015 UTC,"That answer depends a lot on ""when"" in the timeline you're talking about.  His motivation certainly isn't the same from day one, where he was just trying to avoid getting thrashed by Hiratsuka-sensei or getting held back a year.  Pride's always a factor, so you can't dismiss it, but it's not always working the same way.  He's not competitive to the same degree that Yukino is, after all.  There's also a warped kind of pride in being ""true to himself"" - living up to everybody's worst expectations of him.  They call him ""a thing,"" so he lives up to that and dehumanizes himself.  Then he's left hurt and confused when suddenly people get upset at him living up to that kind of dehumanizing label.  So then he wants to prove he can actually seek out a more virtuous solution.  Spoiler  It's hard to talk about this without delving into material that's going to be covered this season anyways.  You really don't want some of these plot points being spoiled for you."

OreGairuSNAFU,33s1it,socalso,3,Sat Apr 25 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"It's possible it was a pack-in with one of the blu-ray sets.  If it's not some kind of bootleg ripped from the videos, that's the most likely thing.  Amazon.jp and cdjapan don't have it, which doesn't definitely mean it never got an official release, but is a fair indicator.  edit: double-checked amazon and did find a couple items I didn't notice before - a character song album and two dj cds.  The character song album includes some of the incidental music from the show, like the song they performed at the festival and the ""band arrange"" version of Hello Alone, and a couple others as well (not the 41-track OST for sure, though).  I don't know what they contain but its presumably either some kind of actor commentary or drama cd; of limited value to you in any case, unless you're fluent enough to follow along with audio-only.  Thanks to your question, I nabbed the character album for myself!  They've still got a bunch left in stock if you're interested."

She really cares about Yukinon and she wants Yukinon to surpass her. You get me do you? In reality if your lil brother or sister achieved something better than you you'll be proud and happy. That's why she wants Yukinon to join the STudent council elections. Remember in episode 3? When she knew about the news to hachiman she was a bit bummed out that yukinon ain't joining the elections and said ""boring."" She has that unconditional love for her and hoping one day Yukinon can understand what Haruno is doing for her. And now on ep 4 she said yukinon is like their mother (the way they do their work, using others to do their dirty work) and haruno doesn't want yukinon to be like that and she wants to change her for the better and now Yukinon is joining the elections. Btw, when Hayama said the girl she loves starts with the letter ""Y"" i think it's Yukinon as well and he made a dumb move and that's why Haruno hates him. Haruno likes Hikigaya because the way they think is at the same level and that's why sensei's favorite is hachiman as well. Won't blame them at the age of 16?? Or 17 (teen mentality) who now thinks like a mid 20's (mature mentality) This is my opinion i didn't read the LN. No spoiler replies please if you think what i've said is wrong.

It seems that Hayato did this because he feels guilty for episode 2 and he also seems hates to Hachiman's methods, but he seems more sad about how Hachiman treats himself. It is a bit weird that he still feels like a loner and loser despite having friends that care about him, but honestly I sometimes feel that way despite having good friends and family. Like other episode there were some things I didn't get like who was the girl with Tobe and what the deal between Yukino, her sister, and her joining the student council, I forgot. I did really like this episode, but why was the scene before the ending so dramatic?"

OreGairuSNAFU,33e8bv,LadWatcherIsHere,4,Wed Apr 22 01:03:48 2015 UTC,"That's the charm behind it. Unlike most animes from LN which try to explain every little thing and are mostly straight forward with what they want to share with the reader, this anime on the other hand depends entirely on being the antithesis of that particular aspect. You watch the anime and you get your own conclusions. Similar to Death Parade, another anime of 2015 that I recommend.  Although what I'm surprised is that no matter how many opinions I read from this show, everyone has a little something they're right about and that is worth to hear. God this is truly the best LN and Anime of 2014 and 2015 respectively."
OreGairuSNAFU,33e8bv,guyofred,6,Wed Apr 22 01:17:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree. For the most part the LN was straightforward and easy to follow. The anime is rushed as fuck and left out a lot of details. Seriously, there were people calling Yukino a bitch in the discussion thread even though her reason for that was justified. But the anime completely glossed over that so it made her seem angry for no reason and I had to clarify that several times. If I were an animeonlyfag I would probably be lost, too. There's a difference between omitting details and leaving things up to the viewers."
OreGairuSNAFU,33e8bv,LadWatcherIsHere,3,Wed Apr 22 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"If I were an animeonlyfag I would probably be lost, too.    That's the thing. When you see a lot of faggots animes based on LN, you can lose your common sense so this feels fresh compared to what the season has planned. I can understand Oregairu perfectly but most anime fans cannot because of that very thing about being an animeonlyfag, especially if the animes you're watching aren't that good."
OreGairuSNAFU,33e8bv,Phuqs,2,Wed Apr 22 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing that up. I only watch Anime, but I figured that there was something more than just that Yukino got mad for no reason."
OreGairuSNAFU,33e9sz,Fruitsy,3,Tue Apr 21 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"This is what she said at the end of vol9 ch6 regarding the request:   “I’ll help too…”  Yuigahama turned her face to me and said so with a trembling tone. When our eyes met, she showed me a smile with damp eyes.   So yeah, looks like she did."
OreGairuSNAFU,33e9sz,ShrewOne,2,Tue Apr 21 23:08:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I was mistaken and only thought it was only for the Xmas event. Thanks for the clarification though!"
OreGairuSNAFU,33e9sz,socalso,2,Tue Apr 21 23:26:51 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to what I think you are, she was there at the time and 8man pitched his request to the Service Club, not Yukinoshita specifically, so... presumably?  It's not something that's articulated in a very obvious way, unless you want to read something into the fact that it's Yukino who denies having completed 8man's request at the end of 9 (in reference to his desire for ""something genuine,"" as opposed to helping him figure out the Student Council's Christmas clusterfuck).  I would assume Yui would feel the same way and more or less be on the same wavelength as Yukino on that point."
OreGairuSNAFU,33e9sz,socalso,3,Tue Apr 21 22:25:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah its that. I just wondered because I felt that Yui only accepted the Xmas part of his request whereas Yukino accepted both.   This line: Watching our exchange in a daze, Yuigahama went “ah” suddenly with a small voice. Then, with a gaze that wasn’t looking anywhere, she slipped out a murmur. “I think… I kind of understand… It might be okay if Hikki doesn’t though.  made me wonder because it dosnt look like she was on the same wavelength if she only kinds of understands. I might be very wrong though"
OreGairuSNAFU,33c21l,stepmarv,5,Tue Apr 21 08:33:15 2015 UTC,"Up to date with the LNs here. There is no full consens on whether we stop with volume 9 or 10. But for me, volume 9 was to Hachiman what Disapperance was to Kyon: A full test of character and reflection on the situation as it stands now. It would therefor make a very good climax. Is that a good enough comparison?"
OreGairuSNAFU,33c21l,Taiboss,2,Tue Apr 21 09:23:09 2015 UTC,hm i see so a very dramatic event that puts his very character in question. Good comparison. Then does that certain event in the story cut deep? I wonder what it is that it was enough for hachiman to actually change.  Edit: added something
OreGairuSNAFU,33c21l,Taiboss,2,Tue Apr 21 10:15:26 2015 UTC,"For this question you can compare volume 9 to Index's NT10: Of course the changes are permanent, but since we only have few novels (10 and 10.5), who take place after that we do not have much time where we can see just how much changed and deep it was- Volume 10 was more like a epilogue to 9 and a prologue for a climax in the upcoming volume 11- similar to NT11 and NT12. 10.5 is a bunch of short stories, of which not all are translated, so I'd like to leave them out as of now.   Of course it's possible I am totally misunderstanding. It seems this subreddit has its fair share of fans who are far more into it than me."
OreGairuSNAFU,33avwf,guyofred,4,Tue Apr 21 01:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yukino ran for president for many reasons. First and foremost, 8man makes a comment saying how even if Yui+Yukino find a way to make isshiki lose the election, they will be installing a superficial, puppet on the student council. Above all else, Yukino HATES superficiality. Therefore they needed to find a suitable candidate. Yukino wanted Hayama to become the president but he refused to, so that option was out. She then decided for herself to become president because she did not want to lose to 8man's way of doing things. She also suspected that 8man was going to create a vote of no confidence if Iroha had a bad campaign speech. And if anyone were to intentionally give a bad campaign speech, it would be 8man. She did not want anyone to get hurt by doing things her way, even though ultimately if she had become president, the service club would have fallen apart."
OreGairuSNAFU,33avwf,Pi_lord,5,Tue Apr 21 01:30:02 2015 UTC,But even when 8man explained what he did and Yukino backed down she seemed legitimately upset and/or disappointed as if she had other plans beyond the request.
OreGairuSNAFU,33avwf,Pi_lord,2,Tue Apr 21 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's true. I reread over the chapter and Yukino said, ""I thought for sure you could understand... "" after 8man told her she did not need to run for president. I guess I misinterpreted your question. My bad. I guess that means I also am unsure of why she truly ran."
OreGairuSNAFU,33avwf,cynest,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"There's a few ways I've interpreted it, some of which are mutually exclusive to varying degrees. With all of these remember that not only did 8man convince Iroha to run, he also demonstrated that she would probably win.    Yukino wanted the office to surpass Haruno. In this case, she's left disappointed that 8man isn't supporting her and getting that she wants to do this for her own reasons. Yukino wants the office as the next step for the club as indicated by Meguri.  Yukino didn't want a situation where 8man has to fix the situation himself. Moreover, she wants him to include her and Yui. She views the situation as being a shallow fix."
OreGairuSNAFU,33avwf,sonanddeath,2,Sat Apr 25 22:40:59 2015 UTC,"Incidentally, I, too, am rereading volume 8 at the moment, and I'm equally confused—not just about her motives but about her character as well. The theme developed between volumes 7–9 seems to be that you can solve a situation without solving the actual problem. Of course, the most important instantiation of this theme is the Tobe-Ebina-8man imbroglio at the end of the last volume. While 8man fixes the situation (i.e., keeps Hayama's group in tact), he does not fix the problem (i.e., Tobe will inevitably try to ask Ebina out again, and we're back to square one). Yukino finds 8man's actions reprehensible, because he never actually fixes the problem. She prefers a long-term solution, a philosophy that she demonstrates even in the first episode when she's teaching Yui to cook.  In volume 8, we immediately get another dilemma that, beneath it all, is unmistakable from the dilemma in the last novel. Here, the situation is that Isshiki doesn't want to be student council president, and the problem is that she wants to remain in good standing with everyone (this seems to be the problem at the root of this high school!).   8man initially suggests giving a terrible campaign speech, which would, in effect, fix the situation (i.e., Isshiki would not be president) but does not fix the problem (i.e., she would look bad because of 8man + he'd hurt his own reputation again). By running for president with Hayama's backing, Yukino offers Isshiki the option of an honorable defeat. Yukino has seniority over her, a fairly good reputation in spite of her personality, and the support of the most popular boy in school. Isshiki would lose, but really, nobody could have defeated Yukino. Thus, both the situation and the problem are resolved.  However—and this is the undercutting irony—by becoming student council president, Yukino is stooping down to 8man's own level. The service club, following the Kyoto trip, is in shambles. 8man notes that if Yukino becomes the president, then the service club will fall to the wayside. In effect, the situation (i.e., the awkwardness in the group) will be diffused, but the problem (i.e., 8man's self-mortification) remains unfixed. Rather than teaching 8man to treat himself more kindly, she's merely ""fixing"" the situation by ending the service club, leaving the problem still in tact.   Yukino should understand this, which is why her behavior frankly puzzles me. (I haven't reread the last two chapters, so perhaps it's clarified, and I'll update if it is.) Then again, it could just be Yukino's attempt at employing 8man's own methods. Hayama does the same earlier in this volume when he snaps at the two girls. Like 8man, he disregards how his image will be affected by his words/actions and tells the girls to piss off in order to protect 8man. 8man pretends that he doesn't hurt himself when he ruins his own image for the sake of others, but Hayama shows us that it's dreadfully painful: “…I feel terrible for doing it. I don’t want to do it ever again” (8.5) Hence, I suspect that Yukino's actions here may, like Hayama, be her attempt to test 8man's methods for herself and evaluate them. Or just to bypass a true SNAFU.  Haruno offers another dimension to Yukino's decision, and frankly, their relationship is still something that I'm puzzling over. I feel that I've already made this whole topic more murky than clear, but, anyway, food for thought."
OreGairuSNAFU,33avwf,Jiraex,2,Tue Apr 21 02:12:48 2015 UTC,"The conflict of volume 8 is the issue with what is superficial and what isn't.  Hachiman chose to go against his own principles for the sake of another group's relationship, but this also reflects on his own relationships. Yukino is upset at this.  What exactly is the current relationship that binds the three together? The Service Club and only the Service Club. How genuine is a relationship if the only thing holding them together is a simple title?  Now we look at Yukino. She wants or is seeking for something beyond that. So she decides to run for president and this isn't just because Haruno egged her on nor was it only because of Hachiman's plan to kill himself socially. She wanted to do it herself personally. This means the club will have to disband.  But should that really matter?  She wanted the both of them, at the very least, Hachiman, to understand this. I think it should be self-explanatory after that emphasized quote of hers in chapter 8."
OreGairuSNAFU,33avwf,Fruitsy,2,Tue Apr 21 21:02:27 2015 UTC,We dont know; 8man doesn't fully know either. He mentions this after the roller coaster scene when Yukino mentioned he wanting to save something.

If there's anyone I shipped with 8man, it was saki first, then sensei then yukino.  If she was given more screen time I'm sure I would have shipped Kawasaki all the way."
OreGairuSNAFU,3345nj,WhatsupSoul,2,Sun Apr 19 20:07:59 2015 UTC,I see. That's truly disheartening... I thought she could add a grain of comedy to the series if she hanged out with the main cast more often.

OreGairuSNAFU,3351q4,Zereon,5,Sun Apr 19 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"Hayama is the most complex and interesting character in the series. I dont even know whether I hate him or love him. At first I thought he was a generic ""nice guy"" bishounen used to contrast Hachiman, who is at the ""bottom"", and everyone else but now it's scary how similar they are. I'm hoping that volume 11 will go more in depth with the relationships between the Hayamas and Yukinoshitas because it's really interesting and Watari never really expanded on it."
OreGairuSNAFU,3351q4,guyofred,3,Sun Apr 19 20:58:08 2015 UTC,"I wrote something up about Hayama (and his relationship with 8man) in a thread here a couple weeks ago, which may be of interest to you. It's hard to know what to make of Hayama. As much as I want and am compelled to talk about Hayama, I ardently feel that we still do not have enough information to do anything more than speculate about him. He hints at parts of his character that we have yet to see developed, and until we understand his relationship with the Yukinoshita family in the past, I doubt that we will be able to know much about him. I anticipate that volume 11 will deal with this relationship directly, especially given the extent to which it backdropped volume 10. Your analysis does a good job of showing how ""expectations"" factor into Hayama's decisions, in volume 10 in particular, and I expect that the source of his behavior will have to be explained at some point.  Looking over 10.8 after reading your analysis, I was struck by the lines (spoken while 8man and Hayama are observing Yukino):              This scene, I think, confirms the drama that we'll see in the next volume or so.   As I watch season 2, I am more and more impressed by WW's decision to integrate Hayama's group as main characters in the series. Though we are to understand Hayama's group as direct opposites of 8man and Yukino, we, of course, are beginning to see that both as groups and as individuals, they encounter many of the same subsurface problems, providing the series with its most interesting dimensions."
OreGairuSNAFU,3351q4,sonanddeath,3,Sun Apr 19 21:29:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting that link! I read it through, and didn't realize that the Memorandums were anonymous, lol. I thought they were all written by 8man, but after reading why the majority of readers attribute it (the 2nd Memo) to Hayato, I agree that it's certainly something he would have written rather than Haruno (as of this point of time, at least. It melds well with what limited understanding we have of his character).  Moreover, I wasn't aware of what Danzai's 'No Longer Human' meant. Didn't read philosophy (since it seems something like that ><) or anything related to those fields, but your point raised regarding the similarities between Hayato and 8man seems really legit :D  ""The true difference between Hikigaya and Hayama is that Hikigaya is isolated within society // external, while Hayama is isolated within himself // interal."" Naturally, this is in addition to the superficial differences between their social statuses and abilities.  Yet it seems that finally in Vol. 10 (for a short bit, at least), 8man finally realizes that he and Hayato aren't that different, despite their differences mentioned above. They share the same ideals, same usage of (different) masks towards society, and even though they're stuck in forms of isolation, they're in the similar situation of being isolated.  If I were to venture a guess, it's something like the idea of Common Knowledge (in the field of Logic) that makes their exchanges more genuine (for Hayato at least, in Vol. 10). 8man (finally) knows Hayato isn't what 8man made him out to be, while Hayato pretty much knew earlier that 8man shared the same different problem as him and envied him for that. And 8man knows that Hayato knows and vice-versa, and both of them know that each other know, ad infinitum.  Which makes their exchanges one of the more amusing (and introspective) parts of the series that is enjoyable, lol. Especially taking into account what happened between 8man and Yui/Yuki in Vol 9 about wanting something genuine (which Iroha and later Yumiko also sought after (though maybe I got the order wrong), it's possible that Hayato also wanted something genuine with 8man. Or failing that, his change of reaction (from resignation to belief) to his actions (of non-action) was also because he wanted something genuine for himself. This ties in nicely with the 8man/isolated from society by both his actions and society/external and Hayato/isolated from within by both his actions and society/internal idea: Getting a genuine relationship/acquaintanceship with 8man may solve 8man's problems that are external, but it's not as crucial to Hayato's problem which is internal. In that case, his belief in himself could finally be his decision (like 8man) to want something genuine (which 8man could tell was sincere).  Finally, regarding your quote in 10.8, I assumed they were talking about 8man not noticing that Yukino had changed (this brings to mind Hayato's 'she's not chasing after shadows/someone's back anymore, but that's pretty much the only thing that's changed-quote). It's possible though, that Hayato had been talking about an aspect of his relationship with 8man (or the likely triangle between him, 8man and Yukino that's widely anticipated in Vol 11) which had changed after 8man finally saw past Hayato's mask."

OreGairuSNAFU,332x6x,gintoki1,3,Sun Apr 19 00:34:07 2015 UTC,"Hachiman never really solves the problem, he only fixes it on the surface or pushes it aside. For the Tobe thing Tobe said he's not going to give up meaning that he'll eventually ask out Ebina and he'll obviously get rejected and that ruins the group dynamic Hayama, Miura, and Ebina likes. Yukinoshita wants to completely and thoroughly solve the problem so that Tobe doesn't ask Ebina out or at least knows why he shouldn't.   Just every other problem he ""solved"" Hachiman just swept it under the rug rather than actually solve it."

OreGairuSNAFU,333i7l,socalso,2,Sun Apr 19 06:36:36 2015 UTC,Might of been Vol 9 but Watari said in an afterword that the story is coming to a close; it'd be a stretch to think that there would be more than 12/13 volumes. I'd assume that the LN would end around the time the school year ends in the novels and that's rapidly approaching
OreGairuSNAFU,333i7l,Fruitsy,2,Sun Apr 19 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"At the pace the novels are going, that makes some sense... still.  Seems like it would be ending pretty suddenly, unless the pace of subsequent volumes picks up rapidly and covers more time.  At the current pace of roughly a month of story-time per volume, that would leave a whole 'nother year of high school for them all.  Assuming that something crazy happens during next volume (Valentine's Day and all), though, I can sort of see things coming to a head within another couple books."

Next episode, judging by the title, is going up to at least Chapter 6 of V.8. Beyond that, you've got plenty of time between episodes releasing to read all of the LNs, so you should just go ahead and read a volume a week and cut out the middle man :)"
OreGairuSNAFU,333ok5,socalso,-3,Sun Apr 19 06:38:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info but that's not what I mean. I haven't watched the original season in a while and I want to rewatch it, along with reading the LN. So I can digest what I missed in LN while following the anime.  Like for example.  Ep 1 -------- Chapters 1-2 Book 1  Ep 2 -------- Chapters 4-5.5 Book 1  and so on."
OreGairuSNAFU,333ok5,socalso,8,Sun Apr 19 06:43:23 2015 UTC,"...that's asking a bit much of us.  Its a lot of legwork that is rendered completely unnecessary if you just went ahead and read the novels yourself, at your own pace.  I just finished reading Volume 1 this afternoon, and I'll say that it corresponds to the first three episodes or so, but that's only so useful to say."
OreGairuSNAFU,331qsa,BlackenedBlaze,10,Sat Apr 18 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"Oh god S1 was much, much worse. You need to get on reading the first 6 volumes right now.   I think they did a solid but not great episode this time and the one before that (not the first episode though) adaptation wise. Volume 7 in general was pretty much blazed through. Adapting all of the internal monologues would be boring as an anime tbh but I wish they didn't abridged or completely cut out so many conversations. The worst part is that they usually cut out the good parts of it. One that comes to mind is the conversation between 8man and Miura. They cut out the part where she compares and contrasts Yui and Ebina. I thought it was important.   Other than that the transitions between scenes were jarring. Anyways like I said S1 was much worse and you need to read it.   e: unrelated question but if you mark your post as a spoiler do you have to spoiler tag the text in the body?"
OreGairuSNAFU,331qsa,guyofred,7,Sat Apr 18 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed - I just started reading the first six volumes (read 7-10.5 already) and I'm floored by the differences.  8man was brutal to Yui early on.  By comparison, they're not doing badly by the current material.  A lot of us are talking about things like a ""whole conversation"" being cut, but go back and read what was actually cut - it wasn't a whole lot, really.  Hayama shows up, pleasantries are exchanged, and then 8man tunes out of the conversation and quietly waits for it to end.  The author actually glosses over that material because it was less important than the conversation that happens after Orimoto and friend leave - which was more or less left intact in the adaptation.  How does that stack up to small, subtle things that weren't animated - like Yui wearing too much make-up until she was impressed by Yukino and 8man's sincerity and started to tone it down by the start of Totsuka's introductory request?  That's a substantial piece of character development right there that people (like me) who didn't read the LNs the first time around completely missed out on.  There's a reason why 8man hates Yui when he first meets her and makes fun of her for being a bitch/slut, and that's lost in the adaptation."
OreGairuSNAFU,331qsa,socalso,2,Sat Apr 18 20:12:03 2015 UTC,It seems that the second season is adapted better. Shame only 1-4 are completely translated so far.

OreGairuSNAFU,32vqzq,Cult_films,8,Fri Apr 17 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"The best way to describe this episode.  Once again, Oregairu nails it. It really knows how to keep context and scenarios with realistic consequences and reactions from the characters. Since everything is from 8man's POV, we can only figure out ourselves what is going in Yukino's head and how she feels about the whole situation but it's actually not hard to figure it out this time which only shows even more that Hachiman's decision is really affecting her. Funny since the one who is meant to be changed is 8man, that's the whole reason why he was sent to the club in the first place, but instead he's the one changing Yukino. Best example  It also shows that they've reached a point where they can't go back and the restart relationships that 8man once talked isn't completely right. And even so,  They really changed a lot of things in the animation. Like if they realized that this anime is seriously paying off so they're doing what they can to make it better even if they change a lot of the original designs. Although it has a few downers.  I was waiting so much for her to appear. God, Haruno can be such a b_tch sometimes. I really want to see more of her since I can't fully understand her even though I read the novels... kinda like Iroha. These two are still a close book.  This episode truly felt like what it was meant to be. An afterwards even though it's meant to be the prologue of the next arc."
OreGairuSNAFU,32vqzq,LadWatcherIsHere,3,Fri Apr 17 04:57:53 2015 UTC,"Tbh Haruno is not a bitch, She's matured and interested at Hikigaya.

Think of it She even went close to Hikigaya just to thank him and Hayato got ignored."
OreGairuSNAFU,32vqzq,Jmqt,2,Fri Apr 17 12:22:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty much accurate! I don't want to believe it but she's always kind of a step ahead of yukinoshita. And I don't know why but all she worries about is Yukinoshita, like she's really protective of her. Maybe something from past, maybe yuki hated haru (haru keeps mentioning that) for something, something where haru is perfect princess and yuki's lost in her shadow or maybe I'm thinking too much."

OreGairuSNAFU,32vqzq,chitoge4ever,2,Fri Apr 17 07:34:52 2015 UTC,What I meant is that Iroha hasn't truly made clear what exactly she wants from 8man. And since one of 8man's rules is to never have any expectations from women then Iroha is a close book for him.

Watching Hachiman consistently reject the notion that a girl could have any interest in him other than as a novelty is still painful. It's the kind of bitter attitude that's really difficult to change.  Also really curious now as to what went on between Hayama and Yukino's family. Has that been explored in the light novels, and will it be adapted this season?"
OreGairuSNAFU,32vqzq,Flatiron_Bonfire,5,Fri Apr 17 05:40:18 2015 UTC,"I think Hachiman's past trauma has a lot to do with this. He's not moving on. He does not want to relive the painful memories from back then, by assuming other's feelings and intentions based off superficial actions. I'm certainly sure that we would fall for words instead. As far as I've seen around the web, volume 10 of the LNs is the only one to give small fragments of Yukino's past, but seemly, not enough."

And seriously what the fuck happened to kaa-kun.  Hikigaya once again comes up with a plan involving someone to be a scapegoat. I liked how it was handled that they didn't exactly mentioned that who's going to be the fall guy. You don't get see so mature exchanges in anime everyday. This is exactly why I love Oregairu.

Also is Yukino like Yui who hates the way Hachiman turns into the bad guy to solve problems. Maybe Yukino is also sick of Hachiman being cynical and negative, I'm not sure I wasn't feeling this episode."
OreGairuSNAFU,32vqzq,AlienWarhead,2,Sat Apr 18 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"Hachiman's solution basically just sweeps the problem under the rug. Let's take a look at Rumi from volume 5. She was being bullied and left out by everyone else. Sure Hachiman got rid of the bullies but she still has no friends and they'll get back to bullying later by another group of people or whatever. There's also the infamous incident with Ebin and Tobe. For now Tobe didn't get rejected but he also said he wasn't going to give up which means he'll ask her out again and get rejected and that'll ruin the dynamic of the group that Hayama, Ebin, and Miura really likes. Yukino wants to completely and thoroughly solve the problems and it conflicts with Hachiman's."

OreGairuSNAFU,32vqzq,AlienWarhead,3,Sat Apr 18 22:33:14 2015 UTC,"the reason why yukinon is mad at hachiman because they don't see eye to eye on how the way things work (not all)   and additional she's mad coz she knows Yui is getting hurt because of hachimans' method. Yukinon knows Yui loves Hachiman and Yukinon knows Hachiman is damaged, Yui doesn't like Hachiman to get hurt anymore (using his methods) again Batman mode on hachiman.   This is my opinion, i didn't read the light novels, but i'll buy it. Coz this anime is fuckin' awesome."

Instead of someone who seems emotional dead in order to cope with his loneliness we have Zaimokuza who copes by living in his imagination."
OreGairuSNAFU,32hq5h,StopDropAndBurn,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:15:11 2015 UTC,Similar to Rumi. She was only there to be the goal of the Summer Break Arc. The rest was just some bikini fanservice and another piece of Yukino's backstory while Rumi was there to show another way to deal with loneliness which in that case was lying to yourself and acting like if you were the one who chose that loneliness. The only difference from Zaimokuza is that she doesn't go to the same school as the Service Club yet Spoiler
OreGairuSNAFU,32hq5h,LadWatcherIsHere,7,Thu Apr 16 17:37:31 2015 UTC,"well, he's one of the few people that wants to hang out with Hachiman (next to Totsuka).    he has an important role in volume 8 but other than that, he's just a gag character  dont worry though, he only appears a handful of times throughout the series."
OreGairuSNAFU,32hq5h,Cult_films,3,Mon Apr 13 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that ended up being almost cool for him.  Overshadowed by all the drama that comes of it, but still."

OreGairuSNAFU,32hq5h,Elhokar,2,Tue Apr 14 10:29:54 2015 UTC,They'll still probably find a way to stiff him out of screentime.
OreGairuSNAFU,32hq5h,guyofred,8,Tue Apr 14 17:03:10 2015 UTC,"While my initial reaction is to answer this question with ""not much"" or ""comic relief,"" I think that he functions as a sort of foil to 8man. I agree with /u/StopDropAndBurn that Zaimokuza shows a different way of coping with loneliness (i.e., trying to escape it), and I would add that Zaimokuza also functions to ""normalize"" 8man. They are both loners but for different reasons. Even 8man confesses that, besides for his eyes, he's a pretty normal guy. Yes, he likes anime and frequently references it, but all in all, he's well-adjusted enough. We can understand why Zaimokuza is outcasted (external), but cynicism (internal) is really the only thing that gives 8man his pariah status. Unlike Zaimokuza, 8man understands social convention. Zaimokuza breaks convention obliviously, which makes him humorous; 8man breaks convention intentionally, which makes him tragic. Perhaps ""tragic"" is too loaded of a term, but he certainly rouses in us a sense of pity in a way that Zaimokuza frankly cannot.   Though shallow attempts at made to add dimension to his character, Zaimokuza remains mostly content in his position as a loner. He makes no attempt at inclusion. 8man starts in a similar position at the beginning of the series, but we get the idea that he's contemptuous of his position. This allows 8man the character growth that is frankly unattainable for Zaimokuza.  Also, Zaimokuza makes a convenient plot device, crack in the fourth wall, or  every now and then."
OreGairuSNAFU,32hq5h,sonanddeath,2,Wed Apr 15 03:43:59 2015 UTC,"The thing is, he does make attempts at inclusion by hanging out with 8man every chance he gets... and that's what makes me angry, that he acts as if he's ok with being a loner but flails for 8man when he's around  Also what do you mean by your last sentence?"
OreGairuSNAFU,32hq5h,sonanddeath,2,Tue Apr 14 01:11:26 2015 UTC,"You raise a good point about his attempt at inclusion, yet he still willingly maintains a countercultural lifestyle that ostracizes him from society at large. Even Ebina, who is an interesting parallel to Zaimokuza, has her BL interests and friends, but she acts ""normal"" enough to pass by in society in a way that Zaimokuza does not. Ebina hints that her BL interest might be exaggerated or even feigned, and Zaimokuza, if I recall correctly, expresses the occasional moment of awareness where he admits that he knows that he isn't magical or whatever, but he doesn't try to assimilate to society. Rather, he—at least at first—wants 8man to assimilate to him. But he does try to have the occasional ""normal high school life"" experience by hanging around 8man, e.g., insisting upon going to karaoke with him and his friends, which suggests some dimension to his character.  By my last sentence in the post above, I meant that Zaimokuza, as a wannabe light novelist and editor, voices Wataru Watari's travails of being a light novelist. Seeing how most light novelists come out with 2-3 books per year, it's certainly a struggle! The thing in the spoiler text, I was referring to a scene in volume 10.  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to clarify myself and reflect on some new points."
OreGairuSNAFU,32gtd3,EspadaPrimera,7,Mon Apr 13 18:08:17 2015 UTC,It's better than season 1
OreGairuSNAFU,32gtd3,Phuqs,5,Mon Apr 13 18:27:45 2015 UTC,It's much better than S1. Just the first scene in Zoku has way better animation and the entirety of S1. As for character designs most of the them stayed the same except better with the exception of Hachiman and Yukino. Both of them look different from S1 but I like the changes especially 8man's and it's hard to fuck up Yukino bad. I still prefer ponkan8's art though.
OreGairuSNAFU,32gtd3,guyofred,3,Mon Apr 13 18:42:30 2015 UTC,I liked the old style better. But it isn't that bad.
OreGairuSNAFU,32gtd3,Prophet6000,3,Tue Apr 14 03:17:23 2015 UTC,they both have their charms  i kinda prefer the season's 2 visuals though. the animation in season 2 looks a lot more fluid than season 1   comparison
OreGairuSNAFU,32gtd3,Cult_films,4,Mon Apr 13 18:31:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I could tell right away that they were probably putting more money down on this season than the last.

Nothing wrong with first season, but given where the story is going, dramatically, over the next season, I think they can convey emotion with more... sincerity, in such a style.  Also, 8man looks pretty damn cool now.  You gotta admit it.  His new design reminds me a lot of Gintoki from Gintama."

OreGairuSNAFU,32fng6,ShrewOne,2,Mon Apr 13 20:53:40 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Looks like it's Ponkan's art at least - maybe from a recent art book...
OreGairuSNAFU,32fng6,socalso,4,Mon Apr 13 20:56:48 2015 UTC,It's actually from the manga. Volume 3 included seven 4-koma pages
OreGairuSNAFU,32fng6,LadWatcherIsHere,3,Thu Apr 16 17:28:42 2015 UTC,"After the (in my opinion) lame first chapter, Iroha comes strong just to mess with the ship wars...  Even though I really like the character (because she's like a younger Haruno mixed with Komachi), I feel like the author has just included the cliche late game character that gets quickly ahead of her rivals (Yui and Yukinon) by developing strong bounds in a short time.   In the same way, Hachiman's odd behavior towards her makes it difficult to analyze how this romantic comedy will become wrong as expected (or maybe not?).  Anyway, looking forward to read the next chapter in the future."
OreGairuSNAFU,32fng6,jefferario,3,Thu Apr 16 04:41:30 2015 UTC,"It didn't occur to me that Iroha's ship was actually sustainable until this chapter, but after it, I'm not so sure.  The actions during the date course were well calibrated to not scare away 8man (by intentionally revealing her plans the day before their date) and yet make good progress on her goals (whatever her goals are, likely testing how she can bounce off him and he can interact with her if the two of them were together w/o Yui and Yuki hanging around.)  It seems unlikely that she's directly using 8man as a tool to engender jealousy from Hayato, since Hayato's perceived to be much more valuable than 8man. Rather (as someone's comments for the Kyakka release showed), it's likely that her 'Want Hayato' mask is hiding her 'True Self' mask that might be developing some feelings towards 8man (after seeing how unattainable Hayato is, possibly she just wants to have some (somewhat) innocent fun with 8man who isn't likely to pursue her if things turn south.).  In short, Team Iroha does seem to have a good chance to turn this ship war into a 3 way fight, considering how neither Yui not Yuki has taken direct action as of yet. Yui and Yuki are protective of 8man as their (genuine) friend, which is fine and dandy, and there might even be minute jealousy from Yui's side when Meguri got somewhat close to 8man during the Sports Festival.  Neither of which seems comparable to Iroha's direct actions (though it's likely she's aware of the subtle tensions from the two girls, hence she did a personal appeal to 8man without involving the other two girls through the Service Club) towards achieving her (admittedly murky for both the reader and possibly for her currently) goals. But hey, she's cute in her own 'Haruno x Komachi' way (as jefferario mentioned), so 8man (and readers/shippers) still wins ^"

OreGairuSNAFU,32gms3,Fruitsy,7,Mon Apr 13 17:15:55 2015 UTC,"I think Yui of all people has the most ""sensitivity"" to the tensions underlying the club... I don't think we've ever had that scene where they candidly talk about such things, but that's a given because almost the entire story is told from 8man's perspective, and even if he knew what they knew, he wouldn't consciously acknowledge it.  But there's little things that might hint at Yui and Yukino having a kind of ""understanding"" about the current state of their relations to 8man.  I think the biggest hint that they might have this kind of ""understanding"" is the way they react to Iroha from the end of Volume 9 onwards.  Whenever Iroha comes around and starts asking 8man to do things for her, there's always a ""reaction"" from them - every time that I can remember, 8man notices they ""look at each other"" and then both stop doing what they're doing to tag along. They certainly seem to be on the same page with each other when it comes to dealing with their competition.  Neither of them was particularly friendly to Spoiler in Volume 9 either.  For Yui in particular, there was the whole drama over her assumption that 8man and Yukino were an item earlier on, because she caught them out shopping for gifts for her.  She's got to be aware of some of those little things, maybe moreso than either 8man or Yukino would admit to.  Does it go the other way?  Is Yukino also aware of the little gestures and moments of awkward tension between 8man and Yui?  You might think so, but we've seen that some things that should be obvious, Yukino doesn't get immediately.  In Volume 10, she Spoiler, and then there was the bikini incident from summer camp that she was completely oblivious to through half a minute of teasing from everybody around her...  And 8man is a liar.  He wouldn't acknowledge these things as meaningful even if he did notice them.  With 10.5 Chapter 2, we see tons of this when he's Spoiler - it's just more of the same: ""if I didn't have so much experience with misunderstanding meaningless gestures, I might start to fall for her.""  He will deny that these things happened if he can, or if he can't pretend it didn't happen, he will adamantly refuse to believe that there could be any subtext to it.  Since the story is told from his point-of-view, we're not likely to get any unambiguous readings of what the other characters are thinking any time soon."

Everything you wrote makes sense and I wouldn't be surprise to find out you were right  To be honest, I haven't thought too much about Yukino's relationship to Hayama. I've always assume that, at one point in the past, they dated briefly then broke up but, your theory about their betrothal and a love triangle makes a lot more sense.   By the way, you're a great writer. This whole post was a great read and I really appreciate you taking the time to write these"
OreGairuSNAFU,32eqz7,Cult_films,3,Mon Apr 13 05:46:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for giving it a look and sharing your thoughts!  Also appreciate the kind words on my writing : )
OreGairuSNAFU,32eqz7,Yamulo,2,Mon Apr 13 06:03:51 2015 UTC,I had to check this thread out after volume 10 chapter 6 because I was pretty sure they were heavily implying an arranged marriage.
OreGairuSNAFU,32eqz7,sonanddeath,5,Sun Apr 19 12:31:02 2015 UTC,"This is a very insightful analysis, and more than that, I'm glad that this conversation is finally being had. Whatever the canonical answer proves to be, I feel that your theory is well-supported by good evidence. I find the tidbit about the age of consent to marriage and Yukino's recent birthday to be particularly interesting given Hayama's inclusion at her birthday party of sorts. It very well could have been some sort of negotiation meeting.  Yet I wonder what you make of Hayama's confession in volume 4 that the name of the girl he has feelings for begins with the letter ""Y."" Given Hayama's proximity to the Yukinoshita family, I wouldn't think that he would use ""Y"" to signify Haruno (especially since he refers to her as Haruno, if I recall correctly). It would follow from your analysis that Hayama doesn't really have feelings for Yukino, but he is saying that he has a crush on this ""Y"" girl because his sense of obligation has turned his mind in Yukino's direction, regardless of his personal desires. However, when Hayama reveals this, he is irritated at Tobe. For Hayama, irritation implies honesty: When he's composed, he can conceal himself, but when he's angry, he speaks candidly.  Consequently, I would argue that Hayama likes and has liked Yukino, but whatever happened in the past forced a wedge between them emotionally though possibly not professionally (i.e., they're getting married regardless of their feelings for each other). I think that this also explains Hayama's hostility toward 8man. Hayama remarks that if they met when they were younger, he and 8man probably wouldn't have gotten along. I suspect that it is because Hayama, who openly liked Yukino, would have considered 8man a rival back then, and they would have fought. And I think that this lover's hostility undercuts Hayama and 8man's relationship today.   Then again, I've always assumed that Hayama was betrothed to Haruno—the ""eldest siblings"" sort of thing. I liked how you challenged this idea, but I'm still not quite convinced that Hayama and Yukino are the ones to be engaged. Frankly, I feel that we are still lacking some vital clue that will solidify a theory as to what happened in the past. Nevertheless, I feel that a love triangle between Hayama, Haruno, and Yukino was definitely at the center of it, and I completely agree with your analysis of how it affects Yukino and 8man's relationship today."
OreGairuSNAFU,32eqz7,Jettisons,2,Mon Apr 13 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"That's definitely true - we're still missing a lot of background information that would make their relationships clearer.  Given what /u/Jettisons above suggested, it may be the case that the Hayama family would have motivation to marry their heir into another family (via Haruno).  So its just as possible that the situation is as you described - that Yukino and Hayato did have some sincere feelings between them, but that Haruno ""won"" because she was the eldest and Hayato wouldn't disobey his family's will.  That would more neatly deal with some of the other facts we have as well, like the ""Y"" thing.  Where I push back on this is that it would seem to remove urgency from Yukino's situation.  That might be an objection that only exists on a meta-analytical level - that the story is weakened if the character's aren't facing an imminent personal crisis.  What intervention could 8man make in this situation to ""save"" Yukino, then?  It wouldn't seem like she has any lingering regard for Hayato, so what reason would she have to care if he does marry Haruno and leave her out in the cold?  But its not impossible for it to happen this way, for sure.  The Y-thing... I really have to go back and read the earlier LN's, I know I'm missing a lot of things because I've only read from Volume 7 onwards.  You make a really good observation about the context of Hayato saying that - his sincerity is different depending on his demeanor.  Without knowing that he was irritated, I would have assumed that it came out in a more light-hearted way - and if so, that it's possible he was simply being evasive.  We know from Volume 10 Spoiler, so my assumption would be that he threw out the ""Y"" line (as opposed to something more conclusive either way) to imply Yumiko, while meaning Yukinoshita.  Why Yukinoshita, and not Yukino?  Maybe that's a trick the author is playing on the reader's expectations as well - we would assume Yumiko or Yukino, when really he was referring to the eldest sister in a more formal way.  After all, Tobe and his friends have no relationship to Haruno - to them, she would certainly be ""Yukinoshita-san.""  A lot of if's and suppositions in that though!  And, if there was more sincerity to what he was saying (as his irritation might imply), then he might not have been deliberately playing on their expectations at all, and almost said more than he meant.  Doesn't mean he wouldn't observe formalities even then (Yukinoshita vs Haruno, given the audience), but its not as clear-cut as it would have been if the context was different...  You've given me some food for thought for sure!  I'll keep that in mind when I start from the beginning after I've read 10 again."
OreGairuSNAFU,32eqz7,Tsuki4735,3,Mon Apr 13 19:26:13 2015 UTC,"I think that this was well thought out and very well done. However, I don't think that there is an arranged marriage. My reasoning is because if there would be an arranged marriage I feel as though it would be to a family that was also in the prefectural diet. It has been said that Hayama's family works for Yukino's family in some sort of way. If there would be an arranged marriage then I most likely wouldn't be to Hayama."
OreGairuSNAFU,32eqz7,wowthatscooliguess,2,Mon Apr 13 10:24:46 2015 UTC,"You might have a point there.  I think I remember that Hayama's father is the Yukinoshita family's attorney?  That might have come out in Volume 10, I'm not sure.  I'm re-reading it right now.  I think he's being groomed to take over his family's law practice?"
OreGairuSNAFU,32eqz7,wowthatscooliguess,2,Mon Apr 13 19:03:06 2015 UTC,I vaguely remember yukino or haruno saying that their mother wishes to maintain a long and healthy relationship with the hayama family. I think that could be a hint that supports the arranged marriage theory.
OreGairuSNAFU,32eqz7,Fruitsy,3,Sat Apr 18 12:36:48 2015 UTC,"Nice! I agree with most of your points and really think you're on the right track here (at least in my opinion), though I myself don't want to speculate too much and draw up my own expectations of how it should play out. At the very least if there is betrothal, then I hope we don't have a cliche wedding interruption scene where Hachiman objects and saves Yukinoshita like a knight-in-shining-armor (or do I?), because that would be cliche. I'd want him to save the day in typical Hachiman fashion. In any other anime/manga/LN I might be worried, but this is Oregairu where cliches are skillfully avoided, so I have faith that won't happen!"
OreGairuSNAFU,32eqz7,phantomvner,3,Mon Apr 13 11:59:13 2015 UTC,"That's partly why I'm avoiding speculating too much on the shippy implications of any of this - there's too much potential for resting on cliches in that.  Though with these books, I wouldn't be too worried about the author losing the thread of his own interesting brand of writing in the end."

OreGairuSNAFU,327och,ginthrowaway1423,9,Sat Apr 11 08:09:26 2015 UTC,"Apparently, it was just a phase. He caught the attention of everyone after that event but, eventually, everyone forgot it ever happened   Here's an excerpt from the Light Novel  ""Fortunately, it seems that the entire school body had moved on from the anti-Hikigaya phase. In the first place, my presence was all but nonexistent, though everybody was quick to latch on to something else of interest. There was a phrase that said gossip lasted seventy five days and that was fitting. It’d be something similar to changing your “waifu” every season. The poor treatment that I’ve been subjected to gradually diminished over time to the point that I won’t even be called on to “That Person is Now!?”; that was my current relevance."""
OreGairuSNAFU,327och,Cult_films,4,Sat Apr 11 08:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yup.  They did cover it in the anime, but it was just a tiny scene where Tobe was joking around using Hikitani as a derogatory term.  I was a bit miffed that they didn't cover it more, but I guess you can't get all that you want."

OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,chitoge4ever,6,Fri Apr 10 06:56:09 2015 UTC,"can anybody explain why yui said what she said in the episode and why she was crying? I was oblivious as to why she reacted that way, is it because she has feelings for 8man? is it because form her point of view 8man's actions hurt other people but in my view didn't seem like it. idk please explainerino."
OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,stepmarv,9,Fri Apr 10 08:20:00 2015 UTC,"Someone used this quote to describe Yui's feelings on discussion thread on /r/anime  ""Even if you're used to pain, there are people who would be hurt by watching you get hurt.""  To Hachiman, this confession was nothing to him but, for Yui, it was painful. She genuinely cares for Hachiman. Watching him become scapegoat again and suffer the consequences for Tobe isn't what she wants for him"
OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,Cult_films,15,Fri Apr 10 11:35:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  If you've ever seen somebody you really care about doing things that demonstrate how little they actually respect themselves, to the point that what should have been either a beautiful moment or a crushing disappointment was just a cheap farce - that's probably part of what was going on here.  That, and a host of other things - probably the fear that other people would start spreading damaging rumors about the confession again, and the fact that his pragmatism disrespected a place and a moment they all identified as being especially suited for love to blossom, and their own conflicted feelings for 8man.  That one, maybe most significant to the slow-moving trainwreck of the next two volumes - they're still trying to figure out who this guy is to them, and he's making those choices for them: he doesn't believe there's any remote possibility of a real human connection between himself and anybody else, and in doing what  he does, he's projecting his own self-loathing of himself onto them, manipulating them to take it up for themselves (because why not?  The club will go away someday and he'll never see any of them again and none of this will have mattered to to him when he's already old and alone in 5-10 years, at which point they'll both be living fulfilling lives without a thought to waste on a loser like him).  In a way, he's trying to usurp their own judgment of him - even if its in creating a bad impression, at least its an impression he's in control of.  It's familiar to him, and safe - it doesn't have any power over him anymore.  Not in the way ""something genuine"" would.  In as much as they're trying to get to know him, his effrontery and consistent deception is constantly shutting the door on that.  He's not letting them get close enough to make a judgment for themselves - he doesn't see any point to it, because he ""knows"" what will inevitably come of it, but even if that's the case, they would still want to figure that out for themselves.  You see Yui being preoccupied with that as Yukino goes, but it's true going the other direction, for 8man too."
OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,socalso,-6,Fri Apr 10 20:03:07 2015 UTC,"Well duh! She definitely has feelings for 8man and it can be seen in multiple scenes in season 1. (Episode 5 end, Episode 6 and Episode 9)."

I think Yukino stated earlier in the series that she didn't enjoy talking to her classmates because the subject always falls to her. For the girls, watching some loner with dead fisheyes suddenly talk to her probably pissed them off."

OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,socalso,2,Fri Apr 10 16:12:34 2015 UTC,"I liked this the theme of keeping the status quo and hating yourself because of it feels like your lying to yourself was pretty good. The scene with Yui and Hachiman was really good and full of emotion, but Yui should understand that Hachiman won't understand that she likes him, like when Hachiman thought Yui was nice to him only because he saved her dog and not because Yui liked him. Yui was also mad at the way Hachiman plays the bad guy to help people, I don't know how I feel about 8man's methods, they work, but they hurt people. Well so far I really like season 2 I didn't like how season 1 got me flip flop on whether or not I like the series, I'm not sure about the light novels, I still need to find time to read Jojo part 7 and Danganronpa Zero."
OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,socalso,3,Sat Apr 11 14:49:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really see it the same way.  I think they did a great job with subtly showing how repulsed she was by his actions.  The expression on her face said it all; meanwhile, who knows that her strongest emotion then should have been anger?  Her slow walk back to the inn could be interpreted as being stunned, disappointed...  In any case, she's never been the type to be fiery with her emotions.  Even when she's kicking Miura around she does so in a relaxed, methodical way.  Her anger runs cold, not hot - and I think so far as that goes, the subtle direction here, as opposed to Yui's explosive emotional moments, did a good job of conveying the mood from the LN."
OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,socalso,-6,Fri Apr 10 07:03:39 2015 UTC,"she's never been the type to be fiery with her emotions   In LN she was at that point. Well not exactly fiery, but man she was pissed."

OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,VincePantino,-4,Fri Apr 10 07:21:50 2015 UTC,Well it's been a while since I read it but wasn't her tone really cold when she talked? Plus her walking--not animated as in the LNs.
OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,EspadaPrimera,2,Fri Apr 10 07:24:47 2015 UTC,"That's up to interpretation.  It did alright by mine, that's all I'm saying."
OreGairuSNAFU,323fhg,VincePantino,-5,Fri Apr 10 07:34:00 2015 UTC,Where's the room for interpretation when it is clearly mentioned in the LN about the way she walked and talked.  Well the only thing where opinions differ can be personal preferences on the character's behavior. Personally I would prefer Yukino's LN part and yui's anime part.

OreGairuSNAFU,319all,guyofred,3,Fri Apr 3 02:41:42 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does yuki's tone seem a little softer to hachiman this time round?
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,doughnut_seed,3,Fri Apr 3 08:35:41 2015 UTC,Right!  It's because what he did for her at the time of festival even after finding out about her car.  And don't worry she'll go back to her original tone. Just give it some time
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,chitoge4ever,2,Fri Apr 3 09:12:24 2015 UTC,Is there a reason that she will be back to her original tone ? without spoiling
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,paladinmahdi,2,Fri Apr 3 12:22:02 2015 UTC,"yes there is a reason, I wont tell you right now.  You'll think you got the reason after3-4 episodes but that won't be it either.  In short without spoiling it, I would say she goes back to the original tone when the awkwardness between them is over, though you will have to wait for that time to come."
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,chitoge4ever,2,Fri Apr 3 13:30:36 2015 UTC,"I want to ask you another question, after watching the episode a second time, I noticed that Hachiman is suspecting Hayama of something or how hayama acts in a weird way, is there a reason for that ? or just my imagination."
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,paladinmahdi,2,Sat Apr 4 13:27:21 2015 UTC,"Nice eyes you got there!  Well hayama surely is acting weird and you'll find out the reason in next episode.  The reason is already given in the PV which was released few days ago. But you won't get it at all when you are seeing it out of context.  In case you don't get it, I'll be here next time too! :)"
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,chitoge4ever,3,Sat Apr 4 18:15:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm an anime watcher here & haven't read the Light Novels yet i really liked the first episode. I missed Hachiman's soliloquy's so much & it was really good. The animation seemed a bit better than first season only HAchiman's eyes were kinda lizard-like. Well, it's gonna be a long wait for second episode."
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,XEYRUS27,3,Fri Apr 3 14:36:32 2015 UTC,As someone who hasn't read the LNs I really enjoyed it. It's only 1 episode so its still way too early to judge how the rest of the season will be. Plus 1st episodes are never groundbreaking or anything.
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,ArianaArmy33,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:35:05 2015 UTC,Same here!  I enjoyed it too.  However Oregairu is one of the few anime that I want to watch the episode again! So here's hoping for a great season.
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,kevinwsk,2,Sat Apr 4 12:21:46 2015 UTC,no subs yet
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,chitoge4ever,2,Fri Apr 3 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"If you don't need subs, you can enjoy it as it (raw.)"
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,chitoge4ever,2,Fri Apr 3 01:10:14 2015 UTC,saw it already...  but i didn't get anything other than just a light idea of what's happening....
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,socalso,2,Fri Apr 3 01:25:33 2015 UTC,"Spoilers ahoy  Kind of shocking, having read the LN, to see how condensed the plot is for this episode, and that the next one will have finished volume 7 altogether. I never read the first 6 volumes so I don't have any frame of reference.  Disappointment?  Only in small ways.  Things I'd like to have seen: Hachi and Yui taking pictures at Kiyomizudera, Yukino's expression when she poured tea for Hachimon in the dinky paper cup, more of the illicit late-night ramen trip...  On the other hand, the pace is encouraging in the sense that this season will probably have time to get through volume 10 at this rate.  Maybe even some of the .5 chapters."
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,chitoge4ever,2,Fri Apr 3 03:38:15 2015 UTC,"so I just watched the subs by commie..  The anime is sure rushed but it's kinda important to do so!  But I still wish to see some parts that were omitted like they omitted two of the good kawasaki moments and some awkward moments between hiki, yuki and sensei."
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,Cult_films,2,Fri Apr 3 06:14:08 2015 UTC,"The skipped around a couple of things but nevertheless, it was a great first episode. Although, I'm kinda mad that they didn't adapt Hachiman meeting Kawasaki before heading to school. Well, that scene had no relevance to whats gonna happen next so its understandable."
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,socalso,2,Fri Apr 3 11:46:46 2015 UTC,"All of her shiptease stuff got chopped from first season, so its not a big surprise.  Looks like they left the moment from the haunted house in the next episode for some reason, though."
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,halfyoshi,2,Fri Apr 3 21:47:47 2015 UTC,"I'm catching up on the LNs but from what I read they cut the yui tunnel scene out.:( While I am excited for this season, It felt very different to me, and I do miss the old art style."
OreGairuSNAFU,319all,AlienWarhead,2,Fri Apr 3 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"I really like how the animation improved everything looks really good except for the CG train, but it wasn't that bad. I'm not sure I totally agree with what Hachiman said about girls not caring about a guy if they just say they're nice, you have to care at least little to give a compliment. However you could still call the nice compliment as a very basic compliment that you usually give when you can't think of anything else to say. The best part of the episode for me was when Hachiman thought Yui and Yukino told him to leave when they actually stood up for me, that was a very sweet gesture from both of them. Speaking of Yui and Yukino they continue to be cute around Hachiman which is great. I really liked this episode and I hope to continue like season 2 because I went back and forth between disliking and liking the show and Hachiman during season 1."

OreGairuSNAFU,3181j5,ArianaArmy33,4,Thu Apr 2 21:08:25 2015 UTC,I've waited so long for this. I actually watched the raw episode and honestly I think there were somethings that were left out and it just really didn't hit me that much to wish the second episode is already out. but nonetheless i look forward to the whole series.
OreGairuSNAFU,3181j5,stepmarv,3,Thu Apr 2 19:20:18 2015 UTC,Interesting. I guess I will be waiting for it to air on crunchy roll

OreGairuSNAFU,3181j5,Nelsong98,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:16:51 2015 UTC,I am definitely excited for season 2. Would you recommend reading the light novel? I don't like the changes to 8man and Yukino's look even though they don't necessarily looks bad.
OreGairuSNAFU,3181j5,MaximusPrimeRib,2,Fri Apr 3 21:33:13 2015 UTC,You should definitely read the light novels since there is some content that is left out in  the anime. Also the author's writing is pretty darn good so reading the light novels is a very enjoyable experience.
OreGairuSNAFU,3181j5,Nelsong98,2,Sat Apr 4 12:27:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I will see if I can get my hands on a physical copy of the light novels."
OreGairuSNAFU,3175wq,stepmarv,3,Thu Apr 2 15:07:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think its out yet  Later in the week, it should be picked up by Crunchyroll"

OreGairuSNAFU,31478g,guyofred,5,Wed Apr 1 21:53:09 2015 UTC,"Looks like it's going to be a good volume for Iroha-fags and I'm almost tempted to jump ships.  Watari really seems to hate his job, huh or really loves his editor.  Anyways you guys know what day tomorrow is!"
OreGairuSNAFU,31478g,sonanddeath,2,Wed Apr 1 21:58:20 2015 UTC,He posted the rest of volume 4 yesterday. I'm eagerly in the middle of it at the moment.
OreGairuSNAFU,31478g,Cult_films,2,Thu Apr 2 00:32:09 2015 UTC,Oh really? I recall someone on /a/ saying that he's holding off until the anime airs for whatever reason. It looks like I have some more to read today. Thanks.
OreGairuSNAFU,31478g,ShrewOne,7,Thu Apr 2 00:35:19 2015 UTC,I chuckled at the part where everyone is squeezing next to Hachiman to look at the laptop screen. It goes to show you how far he's gone from being a loner  Iroha saying she wants to marry an Editor then telling hachiman to become one? I wonder if Hachiman picked up on what she was hinting
OreGairuSNAFU,31478g,chitoge4ever,6,Wed Apr 1 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"He still considers himself a loner, yet he has all these hot girls surrounding him.   I thought it was interesting that Iroha whispered that line to Hachiman because she didn't want Yui or Yukino to hear what she said. I don't know if Hachiman picked up that hint, but maybe Iroha knew the other girls would realize if she said it out loud. Trying to get the upper hand on them."
OreGairuSNAFU,31478g,socalso,3,Thu Apr 2 02:48:16 2015 UTC,damn!  i didn't realize why she whispered!
OreGairuSNAFU,30wt2x,Jettisons,13,Tue Mar 31 10:15:16 2015 UTC,"It's complicated—and I feel that the author is purposefully trying to obfuscate it. Not like this is rare in light novels, OreGairu especially. Characters seem to hint at deeply personal things without clarifying them until a much later date. The difficulty with HikiHaya is that with Hayama, we don't quite understand his backstory yet to have a good grasp of his motivations. At first, he's presented as a literary foil—Yuinko uses the word ""antithesis""—to Hikigaya, and pretty clearly, this is how his character operates at the beginning of the series. Whereas Hikigaya tries to disappear in the corner, Hayama can't get out of the spotlight. Hikigaya thoroughly believes that he and Hayama are opposites, but . It's difficult to know what this means exactly, but as the series develops, it is clear that their relationship is not as binary as it's originally presented.   It seems to me that Hayama is upset—at least before volume 10—that Hikigaya, who can see through everyone and, in particular, see their dark motivations, only sees him superficially as The Golden Boy. In Volume 10,   We don't know much about Hayama as a character, which I expect will change during the next few light novels. After all, we still need to know what happened between Hayama and Yukino in the past. My gut feeling is that it's hinted at in Volume 5 , but apparently, Hayama, in Volume 4, . This conflict will likely involve Hikigaya, so I think it's safe to assume that Hayama will become more of a main character as the series approaches its end.  Volume 10 spoilers  If we have come to associate one word with Hayama, it is ""expectations."" He's the number 2 student at the school, right after Yukino; he's the captain of the soccer club in the later novels; and he's popular as well. These expectations both enable and restrain Hayama's ability to act, because more than anything, he's expected to facilitate the happy, golden lives of his classmates.  He struggles with the ideal that he can get away with not hurting anyone (think: Fate/Stay Night). While he does not admire Hikigaya's ""methods"" so to speak, he envies the results. Hayama realizes that his ideals (i.e., never to hurt anyone) are impractical, yet he can't surmount them himself.   We see evidence of this by juxtaposing the events of the cultural festival with Volume 7 spoilers. Hayama is bound by expectations in a way that Hikigaya is not. This makes Hayama envious of and, at the same time, reliant on Hikigaya. Volume 10 spoilers   The dynamics of their relationship are honestly quite puzzling—and Hayama's confession of sorts in Volume 10, Chapter 7 is still unclear to me—but I think that the next couple novels (fingers crossed that 10.5 isn't just a bunch of dumb side-stories) will clarify their relationship. If we are to reduce OreGairu to a cautionary tale, it would be the deconstruction of Hikigaya's problematic thinking patterns about society, and part of this is to stop reducing popular people as completely innocent, genuine people. Hayama shows that even a Golden Boy isn't necessarily genuine. To me, the HikiHaya relationship is the most complex and interesting one developing in OreGairu, and I really wish that there were more of a conversation about it.   tl;dr: I may actually be Ebina."
OreGairuSNAFU,30wt2x,sonanddeath,2,Tue Mar 31 18:48:24 2015 UTC,"Though, really, I think that HikiHaya has a valid foundation for existing—a thesis for another time."
OreGairuSNAFU,30wt2x,sonanddeath,2,Tue Mar 31 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"HA. That tldr..  BTW, I also agree that second memorandum was about Hayama. He's going through some difficult stuff at the moment regarding his identity and with ""expectations.""  Plus I think yukino liked hayama in the past but he didn't choose her (and maybe chose someone other than yukino). And maybe just maybe he's now in love with yukino but he thinks that yukino likes someone else.  These are the reasons I think why hayama envies 8man."
OreGairuSNAFU,30wt2x,chitoge4ever,2,Wed Apr 1 03:19:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation helped clear up some confusion!
OreGairuSNAFU,30wt2x,chitoge4ever,2,Wed Apr 1 09:38:23 2015 UTC,Maybe this will help
OreGairuSNAFU,30q3xr,gintoki1,5,Sun Mar 29 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"I think it is because she wants to be like Hachiman in a sense. Yui wants to be someone who, like Hachiman and Yukino, doesn't seem affected by peer pressure. She wants to be someone who can stay strong and defend their beliefs against the scrutiny of others. Whilst Yui definitely doesn't want to share Hachiman's personality, she wants to be as strong with her convictions as he seems.   Also saving her dog from being hit by a car may have helped this."
OreGairuSNAFU,30iila,Cult_films,3,Fri Mar 27 17:46:04 2015 UTC,"I'm just not feeling that new look for 8man. He looks too bishounen. Hell, he almost looks as good as Hayama."
OreGairuSNAFU,30iila,Echelon64,3,Sun Mar 29 09:59:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but at least they tried to keep his rotten fish eyes, even thought they don't look quite as rotten anymore."
OreGairuSNAFU,30gbbb,skippy_the_dolphin,2,Fri Mar 27 03:10:14 2015 UTC,1-6 is what the anime covers in season 1. Start at volume 7- 9 then go back to 6.5 since it takes place after 9 and then go to 10. The anime will cover 7-9 in season 2
OreGairuSNAFU,30gbbb,Pi_lord,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:38:41 2015 UTC,The anime does skip several things from the LNs (especially V5) so you might want to go back and re-read them anyways.

OreGairuSNAFU,304h9n,Pi_lord,4,Tue Mar 24 20:20:00 2015 UTC,"I have read 6.5 - 9, and I'm finishing up volume 10 right now.  I just can't wait to see it all get animated!"
OreGairuSNAFU,304h9n,Maindrive,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:51:01 2015 UTC,What episode is this from
OreGairuSNAFU,304h9n,rm-rf_ohnoo,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:48:34 2015 UTC,"Episode 13, around min. 5."
OreGairuSNAFU,2zzr13,kimini1,5,Mon Mar 23 08:22:15 2015 UTC,"For your first question, the point he was trying to come across with his ""proposal"" is that the majority of the committee members are not doing their work but pushing it to others (like Yukino). When listening to Hachiman's ""proposal"", Yukino realizes that Hachiman cares about her and is trying to help her out (in his own way). For Yukino, that was a sign that Hachiman wants to remain friends with her.   For your second question, the events that took place in Episode 13 happened way before the events that occurred during the festival arc"
OreGairuSNAFU,2zzr13,Cult_films,1 point,Mon Mar 23 09:38:14 2015 UTC,"Though, I won't disagree that what he did for Yukino was showing he cared about her to some extent, it goes a little deeper than that.  On the surface, the whole point of his outburst was more or less to get people to realize that the majority of the committee was offloading their work to other people (Yukino being the biggest victim). Of course, he was criticized by mostly everyone for his villainous act.  I'm not sure if the anime covered the Yui speech, but she tells Hachiman after the fireworks festival that there are times where it's hard to say the things you want. This is more or less reflective of Yukino's position in relation to Hachiman. When they met again on the first day of school after break, Yukino was likely intending to talk to him about the accident, but he kind of brushed her off and didn't give her the chance leading to their awkward, cold war.  So essentially, Yukino lost her timing to say what she wanted and it was only after his outburst about the slogan that she could find the timing to talk to him. And their conversation at this point has multiple layers.  Yukino understands that everyone's misunderstanding Hachiman and she tells him that he should think about resolving those misunderstandings. But he states that there's nothing to resolve now that those misunderstands are already out there. Because in the end, the backlash from said misunderstandings really won't go away and it'll just sound like you're making excuses. On the surface, this is describing what they just went through with the slogans, but underneath, it's also referring to the car accident on their first day of school that involved the two of them, perhaps even Hachiman's misunderstanding of Yukino, and so forth.  I'd have to read volume 6 again to fine tune my train of thought, but that's the gist of it. The anime doesn't really get all the more subtle details down as well as the light novels.  And to add, episode 13 are events that happen after the Cultural Festival which corresponds to volume 6.5 of the novels. The only reason it seems jarring is because they kind of just slapped 300 pages of content into 30 minutes."
OreGairuSNAFU,2zzr13,Jiraex,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's sort of what I interpreted from the first question, but does that mean they're just gonna move past / ignore the whole car situation or will it come up again later on when she's ""ready"" to talk about it?  Also that's kind of interesting, why would they make the final episode some sort of filler-esque episode? Does that mean that when the new season starts up again Hachiman will then face the issue of people ""hating"" him?"
OreGairuSNAFU,2zzr13,chitoge4ever,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:39:55 2015 UTC,"well they are not ignoring the situation but he kinda understood that it wasn't her fault cuz she wasn't the driver of that car. He shows that he forgave her not mentioning any of this by cleverly showing everyone that sagami was forcing all the responsibilities on Yukino only to enjoy all work time, not do any work and still get all the credit cuz she knew that yuki was going to do a perfect job.  This shows her that he still cares for her and wants things to be the same again. Yukino couldn't do all this cuz of her ""amazing people skills."" And as of volume 10 they haven't visited the car incident again. But I think they should cuz we need answers to questions like who took him to hospital?? if it wasn't yuki, then why so? etc  And season 2 will continue the events after 12th episode"
OreGairuSNAFU,2zzr13,Cult_films,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:22:00 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, Yukino was the only person dwelling on the car situation, believing that Hachiman resents her for being involve. Hachiman convinced himself that even if he avoided the accident, he would still be a loner so he put it behind him. The ""proposal"" was a sign that Hachiman isn't resentful for Yukino's involvement. If he was, he wouldn't have come out of his comfort zone and spoke out against the committee.   So I guess they put it behind them"
OreGairuSNAFU,2zznpz,JVSenador,3,Mon Mar 23 07:24:33 2015 UTC,"During the next season, Hayama (as well as the relationship between Hayama and 8man) will receive a lot of development, which perhaps could change your mind. By volume 10, I think that most readers begin to see him as a sympathetic character. Then again, he is one of my favorite characters in the series, bolo tie excluded."
OreGairuSNAFU,2zznpz,sonanddeath,3,Mon Mar 23 13:07:54 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason to hate him as of Season 1? He seems to be like a purely nice person, and only got angry at Hachiman because of the way he deals with situations so negatively."
OreGairuSNAFU,2zznpz,Sougo,2,Mon Mar 23 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't agree with OP that Hayama is dislikable. I think that perhaps he could be disliked for the sole reason that he is so nice that he comes off as superficial and fake. I also don't understand the other opinion expressed in this thread that he will become more dislikable during this second season, which, if anything, develops a character that seemed as though he was only created to be 8man's literary foil. Vague LN spoilers"
OreGairuSNAFU,2zznpz,sonanddeath,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:30:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't read volume 5 yet but my guess is he kinda already or will pose a threat to my ship. So That's why I hate him.  Plus I just get irritated by his philosophy of 'everyone' get along all the time, which is practically not possible.  That also raises some questions about his character's selfishness.  Despite being already a well developed character, Hayama faces real psychological pressure from his surrounding  So he's not really a bad character in any way. He's just irritating with his Idealism."
OreGairuSNAFU,2zznpz,chitoge4ever,2,Mon Mar 23 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"Well you sir, are going to get reasons to hate him in season 2.  So dont worry, soon enough there would be more people like you."
OreGairuSNAFU,2zznpz,chitoge4ever,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:08:32 2015 UTC,"I don't hate him per se, but I do think there is a natural tendency to gravitate towards him if you don't necessarily relate to Hachiman. It is somewhat frustrating that people keep calling him a nice guy when the series and even the character are trying to deconstruct that image.   Obviously there's people who admire Hikigaya too much(what with the  Batman comparisons) and agreeing with all of his ideas. With Hayama, he's definitely more nuanced than the average dumb popular character, but I don't think that should necessarily excuse the sort of indecision he feels.   I personally prefer Hachiman slightly more, but ultimately Hayama and Hachiman are both flawed people with similar world views. But whereas Hachiman tries to get results with unsavory methods, Hayama is idealistic but believes he needs to uphold expectations. I don't think either of them are immune to criticism. The second season takes pains to show the consequences of Hachiman's actions as well as the conflict that Hayama feels. I feel sympathy for the pressures they undergo but that doesn't make their actions right."

Its all in good faith since she cares for him and wants him to change his attitude towards people  Kinda like a mother"

OreGairuSNAFU,2xfr4u,doominator10,3,Sun Mar 1 04:29:53 2015 UTC,I think 8man reads moods very well. (Too well).The sister chooses to be happy with it while he says the mood and every1 in it should just die.

I can see that there's a second season coming up, but I guess I should check out the LNs to see whether I should be excited for it :P"
OreGairuSNAFU,2xfr4u,chitoge4ever,1 point,Sun Mar 1 07:13:58 2015 UTC,Yeah either start reading the light novels now or watch the second season and then start reading the light novels :)
