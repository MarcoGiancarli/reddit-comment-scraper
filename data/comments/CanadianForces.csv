And guess who gets the honour of doing that?   You'll also still subject to inspections and group punishments whenever someone fucks up. Anyone here hear of the RCD fantom shitter? Someone broke into the cleaning ladies room, and spread shit all over the walls and fridge. Everyone who lived in the shacks had to do 4 hour weekend sentry duties starting Friday after work to Sunday at midnight. So if you had plans... Too fucking bad.   For saving money. Don't buy a brand new car. Don't max your canex plan. Get off rations, don't drink too much.   Imo. Move the fuck out of the shacks. The military loves prying into your personal life, and living in the shacks helps them do that. You hang out with the same guys days in and days out, so having the weekend to yourself, away from all the chirps, insults and negativity is quite refreshing. Also having a place to cook food, and not showering with other dudes every day is kind of great. You can finally have a real bed, with real blankets, and real sheets. You can bring chick's over, because let's face it, any respectable girl (good luck finding one of those in Petawawa) doesn't want to get fucked on a shitty bed surrounded by dudes.

CanadianForces,3dr9gy,marston82,9,Sat Jul 18 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"Selection was pretty tough.  It all started when we took the bus out to their top secret recruitment base, which was really just the YMCA camp, but don't tell anyone else.  I knew it was going to be a pretty intensive selection before we even got there, because the TV screens on the bus were pretty small, so it was hard to see the movies they had playing.   And once we got there, the instructors were fairly mean. Sure they gave me a nice hand shake, and even a brief ""bro hug"" but I didn't feel the welcoming love that's supposed to be part of tactical selection.   It only got worse from there. We had to wake up no later than 10 am, for yoga, and to induce more stress onto us, the yoga wasn't hot yoga, and we had to use fairly thin mats so my knees got a little scuffed up, but I toughed through the pain.   The food wasn't great, and the music playing in the meal hall was pre-recorded instead of a live band. Breakfast was the hardest,  because they only had two kinds of crepes, and the whipped cream wasn't real. On some mornings they ran out of field berry crepes by the time I made it to the crepe station.    The biggest challenge for me was at dinner when I had the surf and turf, the steak was a little under marinated, and the steak knife was very dull. Something about us not being trained killers yet, and not deserving a sharp steak knife, I wasn't really listening.   A few times during selection, the instructors showed us how to do something called a push up, and a sit up...and a chin up. At first I was really confused because  was only half listening and I didn't see any 7-Up at the fountain pop station. Luckily the fitness aspect was voluntary, so I didn't bother.   Between these ""fitness periods"" we had time to play X Box and PS4, but the games weren't very great and their internet connection was laggy so I kept glitching. That was another way the selection was stressful.   The other aspect of selection was what they called battle planning and a whole lot of army stuff. Turns out you don't just run into a room and shoot everything that moves, but the tests were all multiple choice so it wasn't THAT hard.  If you are mildly interested, and managed to pass the new FORCE test, I say you should TOTALLY go for it."

That was Lawson's biggest mistake, if he had just played the game, taken control of the message from the start and told the media what it wanted to hear (basically exactly what the new CDS said in his speech), it would have blown over. Instead the media crucified him, and now Canadians think the military is full of rapists (which it most certainly is not)."
CanadianForces,3dnkkq,bsyx,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"Not quite.  According to radical feminists, the military has a ""rape culture"" in that if you go out drinking, meet a girl or woman who is also drinking, she cannot consent to sex. The minute a woman has a single drink, she is no longer capable of self-control. Following that amazing feminist logic, if a woman has a few drinks, she is then allowed to drink and drive as she isn't responsible for her actions.  So, by extension anyone in the military who goes out and partakes in the bar/club lifestyle of consensual, slutty behaviour is automatically a rapist and a sexual predator; but only if they're a man.  Ultimately, we'll see this fad of third wave feminism crash and ebb as people realize just how batshit crazy these people really are.  The only problem is we'll all have to put up with hearing incessantly about cases in the military similar in nature to the Duke University scandal and ""Mattress Girl"" at Columbia University until we become desensitized to it. Which is ultimately a bad thing, as real cases of actual sexual assault will be ignored and cases of ""morning after, hurt feelings"" are treated as the norm rather than the exception.  Or it could be generational. Maybe Generation Y is unfit to cope with having and practicing safe sex and what we're seeing in the media is the result of that. (In more ways that just using a condom. Eg. Don't put your dick in crazy and don't mix drinking and sex, ... as unlikely as that is to ever happen.)"
CanadianForces,3dnkkq,giantbrowndick,6,Mon Jul 20 11:50:39 2015 UTC,"We have to end sexual-harassment everywhere it happens, unfortunately the military is just one place where you see it.  I think it is a noble cause but unless we start including gender sensitivity training as part of basic it's going to be very hard to eliminate, even then it's going to be very hard to eliminate because it only takes a few guys to make everybody look bad. I do realize this can go both ways women can harassment as well so just treat the gender pronouns as neutral.  As a woman in the military in the 80s and early 90s I certainly experienced some sexual harassment but much of where it goes depends upon your reaction. When one of my supervisors tried to corner me in a walk-in fridge I mentioned that his wife probably wouldn't approve of his behaviour and that was the end of that.  I'm not saying that anyone should ever have to ""deal with it"" however if it happens sometimes it's very easy to stop it in its tracks with the right response."
CanadianForces,3dnkkq,angelcake,4,Sat Jul 18 10:11:23 2015 UTC,The RCMP is loving us right now.  Their fucked up corporate culture is out of the headlines and we are taking the body blows on sex related stuff.
CanadianForces,3dnkkq,neckbeardbro,2,Sat Jul 18 19:00:09 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Perhaps one day we will evolved to the point were none of this bullshit happens anymore but I doubt it's going to be in my lifetime.
CanadianForces,3dnkkq,angelcake,3,Sat Jul 18 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"if it happens sometimes it's very easy to stop it in its tracks with the right response.   I got assaulted in my own mess in front of a hundred witnesses and no one did anything. How should I have stopped that?  It's easy to say that your example had an easy response, but that's not always the case. Sometimes harassers are much higher ranks, sometimes people don't believe you when you report, and very often, people protect the harasser.   It's easy to simplify the problem through our own experiences, but the problem is complex, and requires a more complex solution than ""it's very easy to stop it with the right response"", which, again, puts the onus, and the responsibility on the victim to solve a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place."
CanadianForces,3dnkkq,flotiste,2,Sat Jul 18 19:04:58 2015 UTC,"I was a Private right out of trades training and he was an MWO so believe me I get the whole ""much higher rank"" thing.   I said ""sometimes"" it can be stopped in its tracks. Obviously that means that sometimes it cannot and you have to go further - and even then sometimes your complaint is not taken seriously, it's not treated as valid.  Unfortunately that happens everywhere, not just in the military.  Sadly even in 2015 women in large corporations, women in the public service and government, women pretty well everywhere are still being treated like chattel.  I'm sorry that you went through this and it is absolutely horrible that you didn't get the kind of support that you should have.  I don't know what it's going to take change things, I am not a man hating woman but I think gender sensitivity education needs to start very early in life so that by the time children become young adults they recognize inappropriate behavior in themselves and stop it before it goes any further."

You have a right to give me the proper amount of TD before I return to base. You have a right to do that... but you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what forest fire means. Smoke... Smoke has a face... and you must make a friend of smoke. Smoke and fire are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies! I remember when I was with CSOR... seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to check the batteries of smoke alarms. We left the camp after we had changed all of the 9 volt batteries, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He couldn't smell smoke. We went back there, and they had come and taken every 9 volt battery off every smoke alarm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little batteries. And I remember... I... I... I cried, I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out; I didn't know what I wanted to do! And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it... I never want to forget. And then I realized... like I was burned... like I was burned with a bic lighter... a camo bic lighter right on my forehead. And I thought, my God... the genius of that! The genius! The will to do that! Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we, because they could stand that these were not monsters, these were men... trained cadres of professional firefighters. These men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love... but they had the strength... the strength... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men, our troubles here would be over very quickly and there'd be no forest fire to fight. You have to have men who are moral... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to fight fires without feeling... without passion... without judgment... without judgment! Because it's judgment that defeats us."

I find CFB Winnipeg is unique where hardly anyone lives on base and most people live in the city so I would say there is less of a blend of your civilian and military lifestyle as opposed to a base like Borden or Edmonton.  As a younger person you might have to branch out your social circle to include civilians since I find the base has a lot more senior NCMs and Officers (due to 1CAD) than most.

They simply like what they do and have no grandiose ideas of achieving higher ranks.  Others don't want to continue with training and then others just can't perform at higher ranks.

CanadianForces,3daznv,stonepimpletilists,5,Thu Jul 16 22:57:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a corporal in a spec trade that gets PLD and sea pay, so there is no salary incentive to move up, and a promotion usually comes with a sergeant's workload and less time turning wrenches on the aircraft. Most people don't want a promotion, but are pressed to take it because of attrition. That said if you can make it through the shit rank of MCpl then a sergeant's spec pay salary isn't too shabby."
CanadianForces,3daznv,TheExtremist831,2,Wed Jul 15 13:46:21 2015 UTC,Mcpl and above in my trade (vehicle tech) usually get taken out of the shop to work in administrative positions and do a lot of paperwork.

CanadianForces,3daznv,jed-bartlett,2,Wed Jul 15 14:28:01 2015 UTC,"10 years ago, it was reasonably common. Nowadays the CFLs are a vanishing breed.  20 year corporal are a valuable asset. They have a lot of experience doing the job and will generally have every specialist course related to their trade even obsolete ones. They can fire every weapon and drive every vehicle. They remember solutions to problems that worked in the past that everyone else has forgotten. They are a great help to new junior leaders. I often relied on their advice and talked to them about how the troops were doing so that 8 could look after them as best I could. Frequently when there is some kind of problem they are the ones that speak up and advocate on behalf of the troops. Often they live in barracks and are seen as a kind of father figure for the young troops on their own far from their family. They are someone mature that a troop can turn to for help with everything from girl problems to banking to cars. In the combat arms having one of them with the troops is great, they will help out the young guys and if someone is having some kind of trouble they will generally bring it to the chain of command for help before a small problem becomes a big problem.  Recently there has been a trend to push some of these lifetime corporal up the ranks. I have seen one occasion where one went as high as WO. He was very unhappy and felt trapped in his position  as he needed the job, but was neither interested nor suited beyond the minimum required for a leadership role of that level."
CanadianForces,3daznv,oneupmanshipwreck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:49:11 2015 UTC,What typically happens in combat arms trades once you get past Corporal? do you just start riding a desk and pushing paperwork?
CanadianForces,3daznv,CanyonRunner88,2,Thu Jul 16 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"Nah, they're just one of the troops. They do the same job as everyone else."
CanadianForces,3daznv,oneupmanshipwreck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:26:31 2015 UTC,"YMMV. I've found for the most part, MCpl is still out with the troops. Might get out of some sweeping and had some paperwork to do. Sgt has some more paperwork but is still spends more than half with the troops. WO is a lot of paperwork. He's with the troops on Ex, for morning PT and some training, but not a lot. There are definitely some exceptions to this like Sniper Cell Sgt where he has a little more than a section of troops, but no WO directly above him, so he has more paperwork and therefore less time with the troops."
CanadianForces,3daznv,n2burns,2,Sun Jul 19 14:43:21 2015 UTC,"Some Cpl's get paid more than the Canadian median salary. He could be happy with what he gets paid. To advance past the rank you need to take a leadership course that can be quite intense, maybe he didn't want to and is satisfied where he is. Leadership may not be what some people want."

A reg-force corporal can pull in over $60,000 per year, and thats enough for many people to live on in relative comfort. There is also the fact that the next rank, Master Corporal, is already a leadership rank and comes with lots of extra responsibility for not that much extra pay."
CanadianForces,3d7l9c,medym,21,Tue Jul 14 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"Colour me fucking surprised. I'm a (former) civilian firefighter and as soon as I read that members of the military who were sent up to La Ronge were given a single day of instruction on wildland firefighting I knew there was going to be some schmuck finding himself alone on the fireline. The only thing I'm truly surprised about is that they actually found him in ""good condition"" as opposed to dead.  I get that the situation in northern Saskatchewan is somewhat dire and requires every swinging dick to work the fireline, but one day of instruction is not enough. The NFPA 1051 (basic wildland firefighter qual) is a minimum of 5 days of instruction even for experienced firefighters while some wildland FF courses are over two weeks and are intended for the greenhorns with little to no fire experience.   I appreciate what you guys and gals do and you'll always have my respect, but your leadership makes some pretty stinkin' bad decisions."
