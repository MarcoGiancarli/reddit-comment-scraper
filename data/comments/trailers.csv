trailers,3e3b2n,BecauseItAmusesMe,4,Tue Jul 21 17:07:06 2015 UTC,So is this the Dynoco Dinoco logo Dinosaur? Looks like my kids would love it.
trailers,3e3b2n,sergemeister,8,Tue Jul 21 17:46:01 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but the CGI looks so cartoony and shitty against that background that it looks like one of those direct-to-video CGI animation films. It feels like Pixar is actually going backwards in terms of quality animation.
trailers,3e3b2n,foundfootagefan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"that is almost my exact sentiment; the cartoonishly designed characters look jarringly out-of-place when set upon the almost photorealistic (re-watch the 1st 5sec. of the trailer) environments. i wouldn't say Pixar is going backwards so much as they are being more experimental with combining their animation styles (e.g. Inside Out which they pulled off rather well), but seems to be done rather awkwardly here."
trailers,3e3b2n,carlito_mas,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:05 2015 UTC,The leaves and dry grass at 0:34 look so fucking good. But I kind of feel bad about how all the charachters look...

I don't think it would have felt right if it was photo realistic. Maybe a little more realistic would have been fine. I'm sure this movie is going to win some awards for how good it looks."
trailers,3e3b2n,jahnbodah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. The backgrounds and water effects look stunning but I don't think they worked very well with the cartoony look of the characters.

trailers,3duc0c,foundfootagefan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"My comments may contain spoilers to the first contracted - I'm actually quite concerned after seeing this trailer. I was a huge fan of the first contracted. It was a very quiet, slow, and most of all, Personal portrayal of the main characters struggle. It was a unique, and well done film. Although its hard to judge a movie just from a trailer, it really appears that this next one is going to focus on multiple character stories, be more of an action film, and rely on more common cliche's and tropes. I didn't really think this movie needed a sequel. In fact, the ending of the film was so tonally perfect with the rest of the film, I worry that by showing more of it, as they did even in just the trailer, is kind of hurting the original film. Also, I get the vibe from the trailer that they are trying to explain the Virus being directly from this one guy, as opposed to its suggested origin in the very opening scene of the first film. In the original film, the virus was suggested to be the result of a perverse necrophiliac act on a biohazard body, and that it was passed to that deviant, who's sexual crimes had no limit or end. The opening scene was powerful, disturbing, and unforgettable. If this sequel, in any way, attempts to change this concept, they will be hurting the first film."
trailers,3duc0c,MoonKnightFan,2,Sun Jul 19 16:17:53 2015 UTC,On a related topic: what horror film was improved with a sequel?
trailers,3duc0c,i-make-robots,6,Sun Jul 19 21:56:02 2015 UTC,Evil Dead -> Evil Dead 2
trailers,3duc0c,hipnerd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:32:35 2015 UTC,"Thats a really good question, but I would say that VHS 2 was a perfect sequel in that it maintained the tone and style of the first, while having its own original stories, and not negatively affecting the first. (VHS Viral, however, was a fucking disgrace).  I would say that Aliens, if you consider both the first and second to be horror (a point of contention amungst fans) was a great sequel.   Friday the 13th 2 was a pretty stellar sequel considering what it did. It successful continued the narrative with a new villain, all while remaining pretty faithful (even to a fault) to the original. However, Friday the 13th 3+ were all terrible."
trailers,3duc0c,MoonKnightFan,2,Sun Jul 19 22:16:27 2015 UTC,I thought the first one showed great potential but just really fell apart.  Character actions got ridiculous and it seemed they didn't know where to take the story.  I thought the ending was horrible and suddenly its turned her into a zombie.  Everyone's close to ignoring how disgusting she was becoming to the point that one guy even hooked up with her was so unbelievable.  If it had focused more on the mystery of what was happening to her and who did it and maybe even brought in more of her own botanical studies it would have been better off.
trailers,3duc0c,tyr02,0,Mon Jul 20 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"If this sequel, in any way, attempts to change this concept, they will be hurting the first film.   Sequels can't ruin the original film, that's preposterous. As the consumer of this content, you have the power to ignore retcon work or later plot changes by simply not consuming the subsequent films. You don't have to get outraged or write out why your personal relationship and interpretation of the film is at risk - just don't watch the sequel. You can't have things ruined by something you've never seen.  Midichlorians are cannon in the Star Wars films, but having the 'science' explained later in the prequels doesn't mean the original films, like  Empire Strikes Back, somehow becomes less magical.  I like to pretend Saw doesn't have any sequels because I mostly liked the first film, and the sequels convoluted what I took away from it.  So I ignore them all and just avoided watching them. Ever do that with another series?"

During the boat escape scene we see Leo get attacked by a Native, someone shooting & saving Leo, then Leo examining his surroundings trying to get everyone to the boat, and he then shoots the Indian in the treetops with his revolver (who I suppose is ""sniping"" Hugh Glass and Co.).  That all looks like one continues shot.    After reading about Hugh Glass and his crazy ass life, I was pumped for this movie even more.  Leo, Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson (About Time, Ex-Machina), Will Poulter (Were The Millers, Maze Runner), Brad Carter (True Detective S1) are an amazing group of actors to lead this film.

Probably a worm hole? I have never been in a worm hole and can't relate to it at all, so the trailer just feels like a big trippy cartoon. It's impossible to grasp the scope and perspective because the environments are unknown to us.

Fox simply can't figure out the right attitude for their movies, or get any of them to ""work"". The X-Men movies are passable but Spiderman is still still bad ( and lord knows wants him back so badly) and now this. They just don't know what they want these characters to be. After marvel created the MCU, they figured out a formula for their movies and it works splendidly, while Fox is still stuck making bad superheroes movies that feel at home a decade ago."

Wonder Woman is not typically portrayed as a big, hulking woman. Examples: 1 2 3 4  All of those pictures, and many, many more, feature a Wonder Woman with a smaller waist, shoulders, and arms. This is the exception, not the rule.

trailers,3cxv7k,foundfootagefan,4,Sat Jul 11 22:05:58 2015 UTC,It was taken down because they faked the desaturation of the original shots. It's nowhere as decolorized as they made it out to be.

American Horror Story went from one of the best TV shows to Glee meets Nine Inch Nails, and its fucking stupid.   I blame art directors. Once you break into the ""super cool youth meta"" you have to offer a new look for media. This shit is ruining the way that the average person can consume entertainment. Because profitability trends to appealing to the snowflakes of our generation we are inevitably punished by those few ultra hip fuckers in charge.   While we benefit from fantastic design and beautiful visuals we get punished because of the incredible lack of immersion.  tldr. ain't no militia gonna spend time to choreograph when there are important people to kill."

In the last two films there is an emphasis on highly dramatic (and often very corny) televised rebel propaganda. So this is less of a trailer and more of an in-fiction propaganda piece. Whether or not this is a clip from the movie or just a viral video piece remains to be seen.

This could have been made to be actually scary, actually funny, or actually nostalgic, but from this it's hard not to already make up my mind and give this a wide berth when it's out. All three are mashed together in something that looks like a secondhand The Haunted Mansion – a lure for kiddies and their nostalgic parents to spend an hour rolling their eyes at tired Jack Black jokes (don't forget me guys!

Set against the divine landscape of Banaras, MASAAN is a celebration of Life, Death and Everything in Between.

They continue to circle back and intertwine all the movies and they manage to always give it a new twist. All the individual movies themselves may not be great, but as a whole it's become a pretty deep story.   And they always manage to work in one or two really good, really clever scares. Usually in the kitchen."
