GigE :   12000 (bits) / 1000000000 = 0.000012s  FastE:   12000 (bits) / 100000000 = 0.00012s  So in this case, GigE is 10x faster. However propagation delay will be the real killer here. This depends on your medium and the length of the medium.   We should also consider the paths in/out of your ISPs networks as they'll determine how ""close"" other networks are to you."
networking,3e38ez,HoorayInternetDrama,7,Tue Jul 21 18:42:23 2015 UTC,Basically this is packet pacing. The 100 Mbps limited 1 Gbps link will send ten times faster even though your throughput is the same.   You can definitely see a difference between the two if a downstream router or switch has shallow buffers. You need much more port buffering for a 100Mbps flow coming across a 1G link than you do a 100Mbps flow across a 100Mbps link.

networking,3e38ez,Electr0freak,6,Tue Jul 21 22:48:11 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party and probably going to get buried.  WANs are complex animals. While the answers here are partially correct, they're also partially incorrect.  This is actually a hideously complex question. First of all, is a 100 megabit CIR on a 100 megabit port the same throughput as a 100 megabit CIR on a 1000 megabit port? Serialization delay is faster on the 1000 megabit port, but the throughput is IDENTICAL because your ISP is policing you to 100 megabits per second. In fact, if your QoS implementation is bad or nonexistent, I'd argue the 100 megabit port and 100 megabit CIR is actually better, because otherwise the policer on the ISP is going to throttle the shit out of your traffic, causing a vicious sawtooth in any of your TCP traffic.  So first of all, you should have a traffic shaper configured so you don't have the policer on the ISP side dropping your packets. You need to choose what packets get dropped, by using a proper QoS implementation. If you let the ISP choose, well, no bueno.  Now, on top of the technical question which is very black or white regarding serialization delay and propagation delay, we have a much more difficult and opaque issue. That being, which ISP is ""better""? Now, depending on who your provider is, how badly they are oversubscribed, and how they peer with other ISPs, you could have dramatic differences in performance to various destinations on the Internet. For example, ISP1 may go through a horribly congested peering point when going to x.x.x.x, and ISP2 may take a different route entirely bypassing it.  Some devices like load balancers can actually probe the internet links and choose which ISP is the more viable path for the particular destination IP you are trying to access.  A 100 megabit CIR is a 100 megabit CIR. While serialization/propagation delay may be different, you will get a maximum of 100 megabits per second no matter what. Now, the issue becomes, at what part of a second does that occur? For example, if I send 100 megabits over a 1000 megabit port at 100% utilization, it will take me 100 milliseconds to send. Now I have burned my CIR for the whole second, so for the next 900 milliseconds, any traffic I send is dropped by the provider. At the next second, my token bucket is refilled, and I get another 100 megabits for the next 1 second. It's my choice at what pace I burn it. The shape average command on a Cisco router will shape you down to 100 megabits per second, which should avoid being dropped by the ISP.  There are also differences in how some ISPs will police/handle your traffic. Some may allow you to burst and some may not. It varies, in my experience. You should set up proper marking and shaping so that you control your own drops, and you should also do your best to keep your provider honest (keep track of slowness, run speed tests to different places on the Internet, etc)"

networking,3e38ez,thegreattriscuit,4,Wed Jul 22 00:26:09 2015 UTC,One interface will send 100mbit worth of throughput at 1gbit rates 10% of the time whereas the other interface will send 100mbit worth of throughput at 100mbit rate 100% of the time.  The amount of bits transmitted on average should/would be identical. However it depends on how far out you drag the average.
networking,3e38ez,Cheeze_It,6,Tue Jul 21 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"I actually have experience in this.. We bought a 2 Meg circuit and provider put their port at 10/full and all was good for several years. Then we implemented voice. QoS, voice had priority and all the normal jazz but voice sucked. After some fiddling in a lab, we asked the provider to put their port to 100/full. HOLY SHIT voice was usable. All the sites were ""upgraded"" to 100 meg ports even though they had sub 10Meg circuits.  Serialization delay and congestion management on the platform were the real killers here.   So yes, a faster port is literally faster. Even if the CIR stays constant."
networking,3e38ez,haxcess,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"Is the 100 meg gigabit interface policed or shaped?     If it's shaped, x (bc) amount of data will be sent every y (tc) interval at 1000 Mbps to achieve a CIR of 100 Mbps.     If it's policed, packets will be checked as they arrive at the interface to see if sending it would exceed the 100 Mbps CIR. If not, they're transmitted immediately. If they don't they're dropped.     This shaper/policer behavior is far more important depending upon the type of traffic you're transmitting than the fraction of milliseconds in difference between serialization delays OR the couple milliseconds difference in propagation delay difference between the two links provided by the ISP.     The 100 Mbps link is effectively policed (that's the speed the interface is capable of) and will drop traffic exceeding 100 Mbps, while a shaper on the 1000 Mbps link at 100 Mbps will shape (delay) traffic exceeding 100 Mbps and send it when the bandwidth is available.     If this is a TCP connection, the dropped packet by policer will cause window sizes to throttle down, at least until TCP attempts to throttle up again. This should cause TCP throughput rates to hover very close to the CIR, but will result in more retransmits as dropped traffic is resent. The delayed packets by a shaper can cause TCP throughput rates to burst above the CIR briefly, but after the shaper buffer fills up and a number of tail drops occur, TCP will window back down again and rates will plunge back down below the CIR. If TCP traffic is buffered but bandwidth becomes available as it's being delayed, the TCP traffic will be sent and won't window down afterward, maintaining throughput rates.     If shaper buffers are too deep, a large number of TCP taildrops can occur simultaneously, causing all TCP sessions to window down in sync. This is called TCP buffer bloat and TCP global synchronization, and it's not a good thing. Once all of your TCP sessions are effectively in sync, they'll all window up together, exceed CIR, get buffered, see mass taildrops, and all crash together, producing a lot of TCP throttling and a snowball effect of resent traffic. Thus, shaper buffers should be sufficient to allow TCP windows to exceed the CIR for a window or two and be buffered, but not so large that they allow global synchronization due to buffer bloat. Technologies like W/RED also can be used to prevent this type of issue by dropping random packets proactively to prevent a large number of synchronized sessions windowing up from crushing the shaper buffers.     The last thing to consider is the delay to reach a common endpoint (not just link length, but length of the entire path from client to server). Due to the ACK-SYN method TCP uses, on significantly longer paths, TCP eats up a lot of time waiting for a response when it could be sending data, directly affecting throughput rates. You can have a 100 Gbps link, but add a hundred milliseconds of latency and you'll never clear more than a few Mbps of actual throughput on a single-threaded TCP session. Thus, which ISP gets you to your server faster? Assuming no packet loss, the link over the ISP with the lowest-latency path can provide significantly better throughput rates depending upon how many simultaneous TCP sessions your servers open and the maximum window sizes they use.     TL;DR - In the real world, what affects your throughput rates is not so much the link speed of the port, but the method of QoS used (shape vs police) and the overall latency from endpoint to endpoint. Of course there are plenty of other factors that can contribute to throughput (transport and higher layer protocols, jitter, path symmetry, error rates, media type etc) but the line speed that your link sends the data out of an interface has a lot less impact than just about anything else given a constant CIR."

networking,3e38ez,CBRjack,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:45 2015 UTC,Depends on how that 1Gbps link is being capped and if you are using some kind of load mechanism through dynamic routing (which incorrectly could see that 1Gbps link as faster and incorrectly use it 10:1 instead of 1:1 between the two uplinks).  Incorrect capping would lead to packets being dropped and other bad things that negatively affects your throughput.  Having a 1Gbps link where you only want to allow 100Mbps the best is to change its speed setting so it will only autoneg to 100Mbit (or set it statically to 100/F and turn off autoneg).

networking,3e2xcz,myriadic,4,Tue Jul 21 19:04:32 2015 UTC,With a load balancer it's generally a full proxy architecture.  So if it's throwing a zero window (I assume the Netscaler is advertising a zero window?)  That most likely means your bottle neck is on the client side of the connection.  The client isn't getting or acking data fast enough and the netscaler just fills it's server side buffer and sends it out more slowly to the client. I'm making generalized guesses here since I can't see your capture.  Do you have any retrans/dup acks on the client side? AKA packet loss.
networking,3e2xcz,atechnicnate,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:42 2015 UTC,"There's very little to no packet loss on the client side. Zero Window is being advertised from the Netscaler to the XenApp server, meaning it's telling the XenApp server to stop sending data temporarily until the Netscaler can catch up. We're really only seeing ZW packets from the subnet IP to the XenApp servers."
networking,3e2xcz,atechnicnate,4,Tue Jul 21 18:19:58 2015 UTC,"So what is probably happening is that the client side of your conversation is slower than the server side.  Therefore the buffer on your server side gets filled up while it's waiting on the client to ack all the data and it fills the buffer.  So once the server side buffer is full then check and see what the client side looks like.  My guess is that around the time the server side buffer is full then you should see the client send an ack for a few packets and then the server side opens up the window a bit (because it can now send some data on).  I've seen this many, many times and its basically requires some fine tuning and TCP optimization.  What is the bandwidth difference between your client and server side connections?"
networking,3e2xcz,karyhead,4,Tue Jul 21 18:27:52 2015 UTC,My guess would have been this or some internal processing latency on the LB itself due to load or a software issue. Client side slowness is easy to confirm or rule out if you have pcaps of the front and back end connections.

What you need is the router/switch in front of the netscaler (physically) to have deep transmit buffers/queues. This is a packet queueing thing.  Of course, if your application uses way too large of a TCP window, you get buffer bloat, which just compounds the tx-queue exhaustion issue.  What is physically in front of your netscaler?

If the traffic is in response to something I sent, allow it in. If it's not, then check to see if the firewall allows it, if not, toss it.   In active/passive if traffic is asymmetric, I'll NEVER see it as a response to traffic I sent. And thusly it will never be allowed in.

If 568A and 568B specifications are technically identical and both are international standards which one is preferred? The information here is sketchy and I have not received a response from many standards organizations, from what I can understand is that although 568B is widespread (especially in the USA) all new installations should be carried out using the TIA/ EIA developed 568A. Standards Australia – The Australian equivalent the ISO says, ""There is no reason to change existing 568B installations to 568A although all new installations should be implemented with 568A."" More recent information, ""As published in the EIA Commercial Building Draft 9.0 as the preferred sequence for termination of UTP data cabling… This is also the preferred option for AS/NZS 3080.""  9.0 Conclusion Historically 568B was the specification on choice due to its early development and implemented base, but as the market and the political climate has changed over the years 568A has become the more dominate and preferred specification. This is only due to a desire by world standards organizations to provide a specification as backwardly compatible as possible.

networking,3e2cnt,oonniioonn,2,Tue Jul 21 12:51:06 2015 UTC,Best would be to use straight cable at both ends and a simple cable tester that test pin by pin to verify how its actually connected.  If you got that verified you can start to look at each host. For example if you use fixed 10 or 100Mbit then often auto mdi/mdix gets disabled meaning you must use a proper straight or crossed tp-cable between the socket and the host (or the patchpanel and the switch or whatever sits there).

Redundancy/failover is a side effect.  If you're confident that you'll never have a cabling mistake at the core, then go ahead run BPDUfilter at the core interfaces. I'd leave STP alone on the leaf switches. BPDUfilter stops BPDUs in both directions, so you don't need it on both ends of the link.  I'm not clear on your problem with MST, however. You say it's ""not vlan aware""  The thing is, it is VLAN aware. Every MST BPDU includes a hash for validating the whole VLAN->Instance mapping table.  Beyond that, it sounds like you don't want any VLANs to have different alternate topologies from one another. Rather, you're planning one topology with pruning of certain VLANs from certain links.

Thus, not every VLAN is present on every switch. So our physical topology has loops, but the VLAN's don't (so no L2 loops, no blocked links in STP).   The problem is, even though it is working now, when I add certain combinations of links that add up to a certain pathcost, outages occur. As an example, I plugged in the port dedicated to the management VLAN of my door switch (Comware) into the management switch (Provision), which is connected to the core (Provision). The core (Provision) is running with STP priority 0 in default MSTP mode.  When I plugged this in, it brought the rest of the network down (multiple VLAN's and switches) as they all thought that going through the door switch was the shortest path to root ('show span' indicated this).  It was my impression that the default configuration of MSTP looks only at physical interconnection, and does not pay attention to what VLAN's exist on what trunks.

networking,3e13tn,redrag0nn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"Edit: See comment by /u/Ironsmith77 below, rightly indicating my figures are high. The below is work case-scenario, with less work being done by OP, instead, contracting it out. Still perhaps high, but I stand by it.  Supernet Based ISPs  That link will take you to Axia's site showing you who provides internet off the supernet - but these are (mostly) your competition. I'm not sure they'd provide a gateway service to you. I'm a government site myself, so they have a set rate they can charge me ($14/mbps/mo) assuming I'm using my own fibre. I don't think that price extends to you.  Axia Connect Gateway Service (the subsidiary I mentioned above) is a service that I believe is offered to ISPs. It is delivered to the Calgary Meet-Me at a price of $9/mbps/mo if you sign up for 5 years. That is the cost from the Meet-Me to the internet.  You also need to pay for the bandwidth for the link between the Meet-Me and your edge. There are a variety of options here depending on the setup, but you're looking at about $30/mo/mbps per site (One site at the tower for sure, not sure if you need to pay for the Calgary Meet-Me through Axia connect.)  Check out ""Becoming a Service Provider"" on Axia's website.  As for bandwidth - most ISPs I've talked to (wireless at least) oversell bandwidth at a ratio of between 1:5 and 1:8. So if you had 20 customers at 10mbps each, you'd buy 25-40 mbps. With that said, oversubscription works better with more customers.  Then you need to look at the wireless equipment. They have their own bottlenecks and getting ideal performance out of them is complicated. One bad connection can cause timing issues across all your connections on the same antenna.  Basic ongoing costs, based on my worst case above, would be 40mbps x $9/mbps = $360 plus 40mbps x $30/mbps x 2 sites = $2400.  So $2760 per month, that you can sell 200 mbps worth of bandwidth from. Meaning you have to charge at least $13.8/mbps, making a 10mbps plan $138/mo for a customer with no profit margin. Now add in the return on your capital investments including a $50,000 tower, $10,000 of wireless equipment, $200/customer radio. For a 5 year ROI on that equipment, you're going to need an extra $1,000 in revenue, divided by your 20 customers is an extra $50 a month on the plans to break even. Add a measely 10% profit margin on that (all you get to take home assuming you don't hire anyone else to work on this - which will take a significant time investment) and you're asking your customers to pay $206.80 per month. If you can find the customers to pay that much for a 10mbps wireless internet service, you might just take home a whopping $2,256 a year.  This isn't something to do on a whim. It's hard, and it has little profit margins."
networking,3e13tn,Ironsmith77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"Where do you operate that those are reasonable expenses?  I've been working with WISP's all over North America for about 6 years now, I also have a 500 sub WISP as my ""home"" network in Canada. I can get 20 CPE's for under $2k. I get a huge deal on my gateway (under $1k/mo for 1Gbps unlimited) so that won't apply much to this scenario. But Cogent or HE is a great place to get gateway service from. Towers don't cost anything close to $50k where I am unless you're building a 300ft guyed tower. This guy doesn't sound like he needs that. I have a 100ft tower that cost me just under $5k including having the crane out for two days. He can get himself set up with 5Ghz omni for less than $400. But don't use an omni, use 90 degree sectors, save you much headaches. But if costs are an issue, omni will do it for 20 subs. He can get a Mikrtok site router for under $200, I have piles of them. Hell I have a cloud core sitting on my desk right now, which handles up to 10,000 subs and it only cost around $650.  I know he's only looking to set up one tower, but if he did eventually get another, even backhaul radios aren't all that expensive. I have AirFiber 5X's between most of my sites (I just installed six this morning) and all together those cost under $3k. He can get away with RocketM5's if he doesn't want AF's between towers. Rocket's are around $90/each and the dishes around $140 (depending on the model).  I'm not trying to start a pissing contest, I'm simply saying it's not as bad as you make it sound. Don't scare the poor guy."
networking,3e13tn,redrag0nn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"First, I agree - I estimated quite high. My point wasn't to scare him, but more of a reality check. (And I did preface it with ""worst case scenario""). I suppose my final comment should have been, don't go spending money until you know all of your expenses.  With that said, I'd justify it by saying that, based on the discussion, it seems like a decent amount of contracted help would be necessary. Remember that this guy is starting from scratch: he's just learning the difference between backhaul and gateway.  $50,000 for a CSA approved tower with site civil work, materials, permits, install, servicing, fibre run from the PoP, etc. isn't crazy if you're not comfortable doing all this yourself (I recently got a ballpark quote from a provider close to him). $10,000 for the equipment (even using rockets with sectors, and mikrotik - which has a steep learning curve, UPS) is definitely high, but factor in the cost of having someone do that install, alignment, radio propagation study, router config. $200/CPE is considering the installation cost (even if he does it himself - it's cost to consider).  All the gateway pricing I gave him was based on utilizing existing fibre connection via the Alberta Supernet. $30/mbps back to the meet me is expensive - but that's what it is via AB Supernet - quoting both sides of the link was an (indicated) guess, but I know I'm paying at each site for point to point links via the supernet. $9/mbps for Internet Gateway compared to IP transit from HE at like $0.50-$1/mbps sucks - but as I understand it, HE requires you to advertise your own routes with your own AS and IP allocations from ARIN.  And remember - his customer base is only 20 people - backhaul and transit costs have great bulk savings. And you can oversubscribe your bandwidth a lot more with more customers."

Default gateway affects traffic coming from the control plane of the switch. Default route affects traffic coming from the switch's control plane and traffic traversing the switch's data plane if it is being routed by the switch.   The default gateway must point to an IP address of a directly attached network (usually a SVI) while the IP route can point to a network that is not directly attached. A better description for the ip route statement is what is shown when you do 'show ip route', which is ""gateway of last resort""  Another way of differentiating the two is to think of a default gateway as the IP address to get out of you local network. A default route is the IP address to exit your Autonomous System."

networking,3e0pfi,PacketPilgrim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:21:00 2015 UTC,"'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0' is just another way of saying ""default-gateway', as is ""gateway of last resort"" - they're different ways of expressing the same idea.  You've just run into two fundamental things in IP networking: 1. routes are selected according to the most-specific match: - the most specific you can get is a host address, with a prefix-length of 32 - usually written '/32' or as the netmask 255.255.255.255 - the least specific is a /0, or netmask 0.0.0.0, which matches everything. Think of it as a shortstop in baseball: if nothing else hits the ball on the way through, this is where it winds up. So what you've done here is to install a shortstop, who is now flinging the ball back to the pitcher. It's a pretty contorted analogy, but I don't really have a better one right now. 2. Routes are one-directional. That is, hosts have to be explicitly told what direction to send packets in. They can't (and don't) assume that they can just fire a reply back in the direction from which a message just came.  What's going on here is not quite what you think: it seems the devices on those other subnets have always been able to ping the hosts in this one. What's changed is that the hosts in this subnet now have a direction in which to send the replies. It sounds like I'm splitting hairs here, but it's very important to understand this distinction.  Also, I think you mean ""voila,"" rather than ""wah-la."" It's a French term."

If you're already using Linux or are mandated to do so it's most likely already there waiting to be used. VirtualBox also has this nasty requirement of a third party closed source kernel module required for it work. Personally for me that's a big red flag on it's own.  If you're a Mac user, well you don't have a good alternative as far as I know. Windows has hyper-v but most virtualization that goes to production is one of the Linux based solutions like ESX, XenServer, or KVM."

We can route with our ASAs (we have a spare that our senior admin is reluctant to put into production) and in fact our current setup has our ASA as our primary router/gateway. I would have liked to load balance them and use them as our routers but he's against it.

networking,3dyjon,wtfpwnkthx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:25 2015 UTC,"What switch models?  If you can stack them you can reclaim the uplinks between switches, improve your switch to switch performance, and set up LACP or some other link aggregation method between the router and the two switches to augment throughput and provide the desired redundancy.  This also has an advantage in that you can then multi-home uplinks from servers and other resources on each switch also using LACP and provide for redundancy to each of those resources as well.  Plus you have a single management pane for both switches which simplifies things.  The only disadvantage is that if the stack is responsible for routing it will have a small downtime window if the master fails or is restarted, during which time the standby will assume the master role.  This downtime is minimal (usually sub-30sec) and in your environment it appears you are doing routing between networks on your upstream router so normal switched data should be unaffected.    If you are routing on the redundant switches and the stack failover time is not sufficient, you can look into VSS, VLT, MLAG, or whichever technology your switches are capable of (if they are at all).  These allow for multi-switch link aggregation for access resources while still keeping the control plane separate on each switch.  FHRPs like VRRP, HSRP, GLBP, etc. can then be used to make any of your SVIs redundant."

VyOS integrates into VMware with ease, and this is one of its greatest strengths.  Having a fully featured firewall/router that can be deployed without hardware is a huge benefit.    Traffic routing is minimal though.  Usually only 15-25mbps.  I know it can handle a lot more, but with our traffic models I would have a hard time generating it."

The incentive for us is that it's free and open-source. Seems like going Brocade would defeat that purpose in our case...
networking,3dvwfy,soucy,2,Mon Jul 20 01:48:54 2015 UTC,"There is quite a bit of difference between them now. The biggest being VyOS uses Quagga and Vyatta is using IP infusion routing stack. They share heritage, but they aren't the same."
networking,3dvwfy,the-packet-thrower,4,Mon Jul 20 06:46:21 2015 UTC,"Like u/mrjester said.    Vyatta came in two flavors: Community Edition and Subscription Edition.  VyOS was forked from Vyatta CE 6.6R1.  The commercial version of Vyatta at the time (SE) used a different (non-free) routing engine called ZebOS from IP Infusion.  IP Infusion was started by the authors of GNU Zebra when they realized they could make money off the project and closed it up.  Quagga (which is what VyOS is using) was a fork of GNU Zebra from before they went closed source.  The major functionality you get with ZebOS instead of Quagga is multicast routing and DMVPN support.  IIRC up until 6.6 Vyatta was also using Quagga for its commercial offering.  The major feature of the commercial offering vs. open source was the web GUI and support and ""config-sync"" for clustering.  When Brocade purchased Vyatta Inc the product became the ""Vyatta vRouter 5400"".  Brocade also released another version of Vyatta that leverages Intel DPDK to implement a custom (non-free) forwarding engine that scales performance into the 100G range.  That one is called the ""vRouter 5600"".  Similarly EdgeOS (Ubiquiti EdgeRouter) was forked from Vyatta CE 6.3.  Changes between 6.3 and 6.6 are a major reason for configuration inconsistencies between EdgeOS and VyOS (specifically in the areas of NAT and policy routing configuration).  Ubiquiti EdgeOS is built using the Linux SDK for the Cavium Octeon network CPU that they use for the EdgeRouter to take advantage of hardware acceleration.  The other big thing Ubiquiti brought to the table was a really well designed web GUI (both visually and technically).  VyOS has made some progress as well.  Initial support for DMVPN and VXLAN were introduced in the 2nd major release (1.1) along with support for 802.1ad (Q-in-Q tagging) and IGMP proxy for basic multicast support.  VyOS is a pretty active project with their IRC channel on Freenode having over 100 users and 11 releases since 1.0.0 in December of 2013 and the 3rd major release (Lithium) around the corner.  Support for Intel DPDK is out of scope for VyOS but a lot of companies are building versions of Linux that support Intel DPDK which VyOS can be built upon.  Specific examples being Wind River Linux (now an Intel company) 6WIND and MontaVista.  Because they implement DPDK support at the kernel level VyOS is basically a drop-in to add configuration management for these.  I'm hoping that with the purchase of Wind River Intel will eventually open source the DPDK-powered Linux enhancements.  Where I use VyOS the most is as a firewall.  The flexibility to right-size a single solution across physical and virtual firewall needs is really a killer app of VyOS.  The firewall policy configuration syntax is very verbose and makes policy audits easy even for security engineers unfamiliar with VyOS specifically.  We were able to modify RANCID pretty easily to automate configuration backups for VyOS devices like we do for Cisco.  Because the configuration file has all system config it makes swapping a failed unit less like rebuilding a Linux server and more like applying a configuration file to a traditional network device.  I use VRRP and conntrack-sync for failover which works nicely.  Shortcomings and things to improve:   Network/Address group support for IPv6 (currently IPv4 only) It would be nice to see VRRP support for IPv6 Adjustments to firewall policy engine when applied to bridge interfaces to better support VyOS in a transparent bridge firewall configuration (currently possible but not ""clean""). Cross-system LACP to support horizontal scaling of transparent firewall. More work is needed to polish up ""cluster mode"" and we need config-sync to avoid having to configure multiple devices when in pairs. NAT logging is a challenge at large scale (10000+ users).  This is a Linux problem.  It would be nice to see the netfilter project implement a CGN kind of offering that mapped a specific range of ports to each internal IP to avoid the need for translation logging. It would be nice to see a DHCPv6 relay agent support injecting routes for DHCPv6-PD and more DHCPv6 support in general. IPv6 transition technologies like NAT64 with DNS ALG. Add VRF-Lite support (start with isolating management VRF) Add Multicast routing support (PIM-SM) JSON-RPC based web API and an optional web GUI that uses the API that can be run locally or on a separate system."

It is straightforward.  When none-trival networking to Clouds is needed, I strongly recommend you rethink your strategy, i.e. build a real routed virtual network that scales versus just make it work, the way you are trying to do will be a PITA to scale, maintain and troubleshoot. Cisco IOS, Juniper SRX, Vyatta etc all support IPsec direct encapsulation via virtual tunnel interface you can configure IP address on, so you can run dynamic routing protocols over IPsec tunnel(aka use route based IPsec VPN vs. policy based IPsec VPN in Juniper's term)"

Student can access a teacher share and turn in homework, but they can not remove anything or modify anything in that drive. Teachers can go to student shares and return homework and grab things from their drive so they are bi-di. So in our case not really worth getting a firewall over.

Using the above scenario; how would you make that work with permissions? First let me say I'm not a sys admin so while I know a bit about permission, I don't know everything. If you give access for a student to place a file in a share my thinking is that you would have to give them write access. If you do that they could modify files and remove files. What would you use that would allow them access to place a file in the share, not modify anything else, and not remove anything?"

networking,3dxh8m,DanSheps,0,Tue Jul 21 16:01:02 2015 UTC,If using ACL's you should set them up at L3 level (which ip or range are allowed to speak to each other). Then on each server (as in this case) you setup an authentication mechanism and connect the usernames to what they are supposed to be able to do on this server (like if the task is to leave homework assignments then using a ftp would be a better option where each user is locked to their own homedirectory and then the teacher can (preferly through some other login) get all the papers the students send in).

networking,3dys9p,Thraximundane,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:15:24 2015 UTC,You should have mentioned two things:  1) You have another wireless router on the network which is doing NATing (not switch) 2) You are Canadian. This literally changes things. not in a good way.  Just turn off NATing on that stupid wireless router aka put it in the bridge mode. That's all. Also this is a wrong place to be posting these type of questions. You need r/HomeNetworking
networking,3dys9p,noukthx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:59 2015 UTC,"You have 2 routers connected to each other.    The TP-LINK ER604W is a wireless router.  I don't see any switch configuration that you posted.  Why do you even have the ActionTec?  Is that the ISP modem/gateway combination?  Does the internet come into the building over ethernet, coax (cable), or DSL?  I'm not familiar with Canadian ISPs, but basically what's happening is this:  Internet (public IP) -> ActionTek WAN Interface -> 192.168.2./24 (Inside) (NAT) -> (WAN/Internet Interface) TP-LINK ER604W (192.168.2.x/24) -> TP-LINK Inside switch ports 192.168.0.0/24 (Insite) (NAT)  You are connecting hosts to your 192.168.0.0/24 network which is ""inside"" of the TP-LINK router.  If that's the case, your port forwards are incorrect because the ActionTek probably isn't aware of how to get to those hosts.  Now you have a mess with static routes, and if you are having issues with port forwards and NAT, routing might be a big concept to get your head around.  Find a way to get just a single router connected to the web, or disable the firewall entirely on your ActionTek and permit all ports to be allowed to the ""WAN Interface"" of your TP-LINK.  With all of that said above, if you are supporting this mess and you are kind of painted in a corner, nip this in the bud now and fix the double NAT so your life is easier moving forward."
networking,3dys9p,Iceman_B,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:48:22 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/QA867Qq.png  A quick skim through makes me think that is your problem.  The topology seems to be: Internet > ActionTec > TP-Link > Host  The TP-Link has private IPs on both sides... the DMZ host on the TP-Link that you're trying to get the traffic to should be the 192.168.0.x address of the machine the traffic is destined for.  The NAT on the ActionTec should have removed the destination public IP references when it gets forwarded into the TP-Link
networking,3dys9p,sosabowski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"Either get rid of double NAT or properly set it up.  First things first, which equipment does routing, and what does switching? How many of each do you have?  What you want it to do ALL the routing(layer 3) on the router, and let everything else switch(layer 2). This is assuming you are not using more than one VLAN.  Simply plug your ISP modem into the WAN port of your router. Connect the switches to the LAN ports, or daisy chain them.    Make sure all the switch ports are in the same VLAN if you aren't using more than one. Then just port forward on the router.    Also, see /r/homenetworking."
networking,3dxst7,Specoz,2,Mon Jul 20 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"If you don't have redundant paths, then it's irrelevant. Stick with CST.   That said, MST is not a significant CPU hog.  In fact it's significantly less CPU utilization than Cisco's PVST.   If the this switch goes down and it's the only path to a destination, then it doesn't matter whether you're running MST, CST, PVST or any version of spanning tree. You will lose connectivity."
networking,3dxst7,VelocityDuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:41:26 2015 UTC,Do you have a specific need for MST?  I only ask because it can be a pain to manage and its convergence time is not as good as protocols like RSTP which are simpler.
networking,3dxst7,wtfpwnkthx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:33 2015 UTC,Unless this unit is switching using its system cpu (which I doubt) enabling MST shouldnt impact the performance of your network - rather the opposite. The day you (or someone else) makes a clusterfuck and creates a loop without MST enable your network will for sure be affected (specially a flat one) while with MST (or any STP/Loopback control) the loop can be killed within second(s).
networking,3dyh51,truevox,3,Mon Jul 20 15:49:11 2015 UTC,"You do not need an SFP, and your switches do not come with them. Two of the SFP ports on that switch are shared with the copper ports at 47 and 48. The other two are additional ports.    If they are sitting on top of each other, just use copper and save yourself the unnecessary expense.   You would only really want to use SFPs in the case where your other gear for uplink is more than 100 meters away; in that case you can get single-mode fiber SFPs to go past 100 meters. In your case, this is probably totally unnecessary, so no reason to spend the money on it. Cable type is dictated by SFP type. Most common ones are Multi Mode Fiber, Single Mode Fiber, and standard Copper ethernet. There's other types too, but in your situation, you've already got 96 ports of gigabit connection over Cat5e/Cat6. Why bother going fiber?"
networking,3dyh51,wolffstarr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:01 2015 UTC,"Why bother going fiber?   It's less that I'm trying to go fiber, and more that I'm trying to link these two switches together in a high-bandwidth fashion. My understanding of switches (and it's limited, I'll willingly admit) is that just running a Cat5e cable between the two will create a bottleneck for anything accessing stuff on the other side or vice-versa (granted, how big that ""bottleneck"" ends up being is more subjective, given that it's still a 1gbps connection). I have been lead to believe that I need a type of high speed interconnect to do it ""right"", and that SFP is one such example. Is that incorrect? Am I missing something here? Again, I would not be at ALL surprised if I AM missing something, so please point it out if I am. :)  And thanks for the quick and through reply!"
networking,3dyh51,demonlag,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:23 2015 UTC,SFPs just allow you an interface to plug the type of media you need into a switch.  The switch you linked has 48 10/100/1000 fixed copper ports and four Gigabit SFP slots (two slots are shared with the 48 copper ports).  You will get the exact same throughput between switches if you plug a piece of cat5e between them that you get if you drop in two multi-mode SR SFP optics and a piece of fiber.
networking,3dyh51,demonlag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"Ah, so it isn't for a high speed interconnect then? Drat."
networking,3dyh51,wolffstarr,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:33 2015 UTC,"Correct.  Those ports are designed so you can put a short or long range fiber module in and connect the switch to a distant switch or other type of device, something that exceeds the distance of copper.  Without knowing what that switch actually supports, your best bet to get additional speed between switches is to setup two or four ports as an LACP group between the switches.  A single traffic flow will still be limited to 1gbit/sec, but multiple flows will be balanced over two to four links to give a total throughput of up to 2-4gbit/sec"
networking,3dyh51,xHeero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, OK then. So, would I be correct to say that since this page with a bit more information indicates that it DOES support that, then I should be good, right? Just set that up instead with how ever many ports I want to dedicate to interconnection (realizing, and being OK with the fact that no individual user will get more than 1gbps due to everything else in the network being limited to that due to cable/interfaces/whatever), correct?"
networking,3dyh51,superdot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"Correct. I'm not certain about the Buffalos, but with a Cisco it's generally a max of 8 interconnects between the two switches; if you're going to set up LACP and it gives you an option, tell it to load balance on source or source MAC.  Also keep in mind, unless your server has multiple 1Gbps links itself, it will also be a bottleneck for anyone accessing that server. Not necessarily a reason to run out and get a multi-port GigE network card for it, but something to keep in mind."

My original statement was ""every major firewall vendor"" (not being iptables, or pf, ipf, as they aren't even considered for the majority of environments), in which case they are stateful. Is there possibly hidden policies in the background? Sure, but that's not what we're talking about. The entire discussion is based on stateful vs stateless, as OP was originally asking how. He wasn't asking the nitty gritty of what could a system possibly be doing that we don't know about. Keep in mind the ""gui"" based solution you're talking about has a perfectly working CLI which the entire configuration can be accomplished.

This mapping exists only for the duration of the connection between those 2 nodes, then the table entry is removed and the ephemeral port is freed up to be used for the next connection.

The final straw was when I went in one day while very sick, got sent out on site about an hour and a half away, allowed myself to be suckered in to a firmware update on a 336G which shouldn't have been done at that time, and it took down the network for an hour...during business hours...at a county building...where all the county offices/officials were.  I was on the third floor and could hear the collector swearing at me from the first floor.  After a series of calls to Netgear's Tier 2, a bunch of reboots, troubleshooting both WAN connections, plugging the switches back in to the router one at a time, checking all the cabling on the rack, etc I eventually got the network up and the router eventually stayed online and accessible.  Since then I know they've been having issues with load balancing and round robin on that 336G, but I don't work at that MSP anymore so it's no longer my problem. To this day I still don't know what went wrong or how it was fixed.  Netgear routers are horrible.  That MSP stopped selling those models in favor of the SoHo Watchguard models like the XTM-25 and XTM-33.  A little more expensive, and based on subscriptions, but far better than any Netgear.  I would have preferred deploying pfSense boxes but the MSP wanted a 24x7 number to call for support."
networking,3dtxjv,johnnydotexe,2,Sun Jul 19 16:05:13 2015 UTC,"I'm in an eerily similar boat right now, we used to deploy FVS318/338s, moved on to UTM5s and now mostly use ZyXel ZyWall USG50s. Deployed our first production pfsense 2440 two weeks ago, some of it has left me unimpressed (configuring the built in wireless if ordered with such direct from pfsense is needlessly complicated for one, and some default third party packages don't seem the best maintained). Still not sure how I want to move forward for our clients."
networking,3dtxjv,punzada,2,Sun Jul 19 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"pfSense is great as long as you are 100% confident in managing and supporting it.  For high availability scenarios you can look in to redundancy, plenty of guides on that for pfSense.  That's the catch, though...you have to support it.  There is no 24x7 800 number to call for support.  They(pfSense) do offer support packages but they are a bit pricey if you're an independent contractor or small MSP with plans to do multiple deployments.  As for the wireless I'm part of that ""keep them separate"" crowd.  Let the router be a router, let your AP be an AP.  If I can keep them separate AND not force myself in to a situation where I'm having to use unofficial packages, that's a win win even if it does come with an additional hardware cost.  If you want a reasonably priced wireless deployment then check out Ubiquiti.  That's what we used for wireless bridges and eventually we migrated from Netgear/Ruckus to Ubiquiti for indoor wireless deployments.  Before I was laid off without notice I was working on a project to host the UBNT Controller in a VM within our network and have all our client ubnt networks in there separated by site for easy management and scalability and removing the need to have an on-site controller.  That would have also opened up the opportunity of adding an Xdollar/month charge per device for that monitoring."
networking,3dtxjv,johnnydotexe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:28:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah we just wanted to see how it would work out by ordering with wireless. We typically do separate WAPs for our devices whatever we end up using. We use a mix of Engenius or Ubiquiti equipment depending on the job (Ubiquitis make setting up a guest login landing page stupid easy).   I was trying to leverage pfsense as a platform to work some monthly services out of (filtering, edge-AV) but it seems like a lot to really tweak a proper snort/squid setup to do all I want. Just need to play with it a bunch more, I want to like it just for its scalability and would be nice to have a unified platform for clients without worrying about vendor support/availability/hardware."

This is a small branch office with 11 machines.  But I figured that with a lot of the people here at one time or another either are still with or been with an MSP that I could get some info.  The goal is to drop Netgear.  I am going to go with Cisco RV320s at all locations. Going to give that a try first. I can not justify anything more expensive to the business especially when I have 2 2003 servers coming out of service and one is a RD Server.

networking,3dtxjv,beenjamminfranklin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"I've run into plenty of similar problems with using Netgear firewalls. Best advice is to replace them ASAP. A Cisco ASA 5505 will usually do the trick for small branch office, just get an unlimited license. Every IP counts, so wireless devices will eat them faster than you would think. I've had good results with Sonicwall TZ series as well. just use the Wizards to setup VPN's and any other access rules.  For now, you can try hard coding Speed/duplex to the ISP, and possibly reducing MTU settings to see if that helps. Turning off auto-negotiate works way more than it should"
networking,3dsmp4,overlord2kx,14,Sun Jul 19 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"In short, VXLAN (or the overlay of the day)....  The idea is we have a reliable, routed IP fabric down to the rack/access-layer (technically, we have to be a bit careful with terminology, as the traditional three-layer/pod topology in DC networking is being supplanted by Clos fabrics / spine-leaf topologies).  Then, to support virtual workload mobility / vMotion, an overlay network is built on top of this reliable, routed ""underlay"" network.  What these overlays are, how they're built/managed, and where they terminate is currently...  a major point of debate."
networking,3dsmp4,not_rfc_compliant,3,Sun Jul 19 02:27:40 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, so it pretty much means you are using an overlay network.  I was mistakenly under the impression that people were doing this WITHOUT an overlay and it was really baffling me."
networking,3dsmp4,splenetic,5,Sun Jul 19 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"It is entirely possible to do it without overlays provided the applications you're running will work in that environment.   Think back to before we had VMs - you gave the server an ip and, a few applications aside, there was no requirement for there to be L2 adjacency between that ip and any other. It's really VM mobility that's driving the requirement to have L2 overlays as you want your VM to be able to move to another host without its IP address having to change.  But VM mobility is only needed when your want to have the same application instance to be moveable between two or more hosts. But what if you just have the application running on those two or more hosts simultaneously and you load-balance incoming requests across them? That way if one of the hosts has to go down, or fails, or is overloaded then you just take that one out of the pool to load-balance across. If load is very high then just spin up another instance somewhere convenient and add that to the pool. No VM mobility required so no need for all the servers to be in the same L2 domain.  This won't work for all applications of course. But I believe it's the way that Google runs many of its applications. I also think that overlays are a nasty kludge that will end up causing more problems than they solve and so, like policy-based routing, should only be used where there's absolutely no alternative."
networking,3dsmp4,showard01,2,Sun Jul 19 07:30:26 2015 UTC,Very good points. Thank you.
networking,3dsmp4,not_rfc_compliant,2,Sun Jul 19 08:22:52 2015 UTC,"I also think that overlays are a nasty kludge that will end up causing more problems than they solve   There is a tidal wave of industry demand for technologies that allow the app teams to continue ignoring needs of the infrastructure.    Back in 2007 or so, I remember our CIO trying really hard to avoid implementing whole-os virtualization with L2 mobility across racks.  Even then he could see that a container-style approach would save us all kinds of headaches (not to mention money) on the infrastructure side.  He fought our development teams to stop doing dumb shit like hardcoding IPs into the apps, or get them to architect the apps in ways that would allow us to stripe them across Tomcat instances regardless of the IP situation and deploy them in a container-like way...   It just didn't work.  He could not overcome inertia and eventually got canned for refusing to enable the dev teams' insistence on taking every possible lazy shortcut.  Now I work for a vendor and I see a pretty large cross section of IT infrastructure teams across many verticals, and I'd guess 95% of them are in situations like this.  The other 5% are Google/Amazon/etc."

Must be nice working at a place where the Network Architects can dictate Application/Virtualization policy....  (I kid, I kid... ;) Well, sorta.)  Joking aside, this war has been fought  -- and, in my opinion, lost.  Short of the Facebooks and Googles of the world, live virtual workload mobility is now a hard business requirement (whether we like it or not -- and I certainly know that Ivan P. doesn't like...).  Forcing all (and I repeat... ALL) application development to use load-balancer-based software architectures is unfortunately just not possible for the vast, vast majority of Enterprise networks.  Some apps, sure...  but all?  And as long as these exist, we need to either stretch VLANs, or start to embrace overlays...  Do I sound bitter?  Maybe it's because I am..."
networking,3dsmp4,vminferno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:40:38 2015 UTC,"Sure. As I said, I know that this isn't a viable approach for all applications. But I suspect it's viable for many more applications than it's actually used for.   I do think that VM mobility is often seen as the only possible answer to high availability for applications without consideration to the effects it's having on the performance and maintainability of the network or thought being put in to alternative designs. And, frankly, I think that's down to laziness. ""Stick it on a VM and then we don't have to worry about it"" seems a very common mindset and I think that's short-sighted.  That's why I compared it to PBR. PBR can be an absolute god send when it's the only way of resolving a particular and specific issue but for most day-to-day situations it just adds extra complexity that should really be designed out rather than kludged around.   This isn't an argument I've had to have at work yet because, for historical reasons, our data centres have VLANs stretched between them. No, I don't particularly like that either and it's costing us a large amount of dark fibre to provide the resilience we need. But if we ever get our much rumoured off-site data centre then I know that VXLAN will be raised as the obvious way of integrating that into our existing data centre infrastructure. Knowing the applications that we're using, and the fact that many of them already sit behind a load-balancer (yes, we load-balance between applications running in multiple data centres but in the same VLAN. Yes, I know how dumb that sounds), I think that using VXLAN anywhere except where we have absolutely no choice would be a mistake."
networking,3dsmp4,wolffstarr,4,Sun Jul 19 20:25:17 2015 UTC,"So you are correct that yes the VLAN's are isolated within a switch. L3 at the TOR typically works for folks who are going to be growing at an exponential pace and are adding both compute/networks at that rate. As mentioned below, it creates a problem where by you are now stuck not being able to vMotion workloads from Pod-A to Pod-B because its across Layer 3 boundaries. The agility that the L3 to TOR bought seems lost. The best way to address this is using VXLAN or an overlay of your choice. You are basically tunneling L2 over an L3 underlay. If you are familiar with MPLS, its similar in concept, all we are doing is adding a VXLAN header and tunneling it as a UDP packet. Hope it helps."
networking,3dsmp4,devtrue,2,Sun Jul 19 03:39:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Datacenter kind of guy, but I would think that this is a lot of pain in disguise. Most of the people I see talking about Layer 3 to the Access layer are talking about doing it in an enterprise/campus switch environment, not DCs."
networking,3dsmp4,mplex321,2,Sun Jul 19 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"It is popular in campus design because it's reliable and has faster convergence time than traditional loop prevention protocols, which in reality, makes it a good choice for data center design too. The problem that came up, of course, the requirement of L2 adjacency for VM hosts to work as a cluster, so people worked to make faster, scalable L2 networks using MLAG in place of STP. But that has its own limitations in the form of the number of VLANs you can run, complexity in operation, and a L2 failure-domain that grows with the company. Also, wide-area L2 networks were not very cheap even a few years ago, so for high-speed connection you could pretty much expect L3 unless you had some dark fiber to work with.   So, with the massive scale taking place with cloud service providers, technology giants, and the like, there was room for a technology to provide many more VLANs and expand L2 adjacency across L3 boundaries. Now, the ratification of VXLAN by the IETF and its availability in enterprise switching hardware makes it a viable option for anybody looking to use its benefits. Being able to scale massively is one of them, but availability and speed is valued at almost any sized data center."
networking,3dsmp4,bitginsu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"As others have noted, the only people I know doing L3 access layer in the DC environment are doing overlays to provide L2. L2 mobility in one form or another is pretty much a requirement in most datacenters these days. I'd stick with your L2 environment and only consider an overlay if it makes sense at your scale and solves real issues for you.  Personally I think L3 access-layer is mostly hype. I don't know any large networks doing it, and we've had multiple consultants tell us to increase L2 to reduce complexity of our routed environment. YMMV."
networking,3dsmp4,sryan2k1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:06 2015 UTC,"Having VMs with 2 or 3 NICs in different VLANs is in itself a mistake (given that these VMs are servers of some kind). Multi-homed hosts usually force you to do some kind of 'host based routing' which is the network equivalent of 'spaghetti code'. Meaning it is difficult to maintain and can make security boundaries difficult to enforce.  If you are entering routes (other than the default route) into a server's routing table, something has gone wrong already imho. If a VM/server needs to talk to a server on a different subnet, it should be letting the network handle routing that traffic from it's one interface and IP address in it's designated security zone. Maybe you meant that each of the ESX hosts are on several different VLANs?"

networking,3drj7q,joeywas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:06:15 2015 UTC,Yup drop the router and get a L3 switch for routing on the LAN. Only use a router (on-a-stick) if you have minimal VLAN to VLAN traffic. BTW In most cases the ASA is speedier when it comes to routing between VLANs but remember it's a firewall.
networking,3drj7q,malchir,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:49:57 2015 UTC,So I can continue to use the existing NAT translations as they are now except point them to an inside interface but that inside interface does not need to match the subnet of IPs used in the actual NAT?  So I can point a NAT translation at a /30 inside interface and then just have the required routing to point it to the correct egress interface towards the router.    I guess I always incorrectly assumed the NAT inside IP address had to match the network used on the physical inside interface.
networking,3drj7q,joeywas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Say your inside interface on the /30 is called ""inside-10.0.0.0"", and is 10.0.0.1 on the 10.0.0.0/30 network.

That's it.  No changing of the NAT statements at all.  ASA does not require sharing a subnet with internal hosts, just requires a path.  Heck, I've set up a VPN out to a vendor and NAT'd multiple hosts across other outgoing VPNs so that a handful of hosts at remote locations appear as a small contiguous subnet to the vendor.   Naturally there may be other cleanup for things like client VPN and ACLs.  If the ASA is the 0.0.0.0/0 for the router, it's a bit simpler.    *disclaimer.  All my experience is on 8.2.x and below.

networking,3drj7q,sirianthe3rd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:01 2015 UTC,"It should be that way anyway. You should never have your prod network and the inside interface of your ASA on the same subnet. I've been told it would fail many different types of security audits.  I personally route my inside network to the core switch with a /29. That gives me room for FHRPs, HA pairs and a couple of other devices should I need them on the same subnet.  The NAT destinations don't change in this scenario. The next hop the ASA uses to get to them does. So when the ASA does a NAT lookup, it will check the rule for interface definitions first, or if you use the ANY keyword, then it will use the routing table. The routing table is what is important. Your core switch will have a default route to the ASA, and the ASA will have a route to the prod subnet via the new point to point /30 or /29 on the router side.

Bulk-Data flows are all large, and want to consume as much bandwidth as they can find.    A Strict Priority will drop packets that exceed the allocation.  This doesnt make sense, if there is unused bandwidth, then let the flows use it.    VoIP and some forms of Video (Video Teleconferencing) belong in the priority queue.    Everything else should be guaranteed some percentage of remaining bandwidth, after the priority queue has eaten its allocation.    If you have a 50Mbps circuit, calculate how much bandwidth VoIP should be guaranteed.  Maybe 10Mbps as a worst-case.    So the priority queue is a hard 10Mbps allocation.    To be clear: VoIP may consume up to 10Mbps, any packets that exceed that limit will be dropped.  BUT, other traffic MAY borrow unused bandwidth from the Priority Queue.  So the bandwidth is not wasted.    Give AF11/12/13 a nice 5% guarantee.  AF11 gets a higher drop threshold than AF12, and AF13 is higher than AF13. Said differently:  AF13 packets will be dropped sooner than AF12 packets, and AF12 sooner than AF11 within the Bulk-Data bucket.  Use the ""bandwidth remaining 5%"" syntax so its understood that the allocation is 5% of whatever is left after the priority queue eats its fill.    If you want to give HTTP/s a priority, mark it as AF21 and give AF21/22/23 a ""bandwidth remaining 20%"" allocation.    The default queue should get at least 25-30% bandwidth remaining.

If I add up the percentages from AF11-AF31, I'm at 55% and that + the priority queue is 65% = 65Mb, but I only have a 50Mb circuit.  Say I don't use ""bandwidth remaining percent"" and just do a bandwidth percentage, do I need to calculate based off of 50Mb instead of 100Mb and adjust my percentages accordingly? So then would it be something like:  Priority - 10% AF11 - 5% AF21 - 10% AF31 - ~12%   Would that work to give 10Mb, 5Mb, 10Mb, and 12Mb?

I now assign 99% of the available capacity.  Admittedly, this is an edge case, but I've run into it on an ASR9k (IIRC) -- it was on GSRs.  1. Let's take 37% of 100M, which is 37,000,000bps.  If the hardware uses 1024bit granularity, that's 36,132.8125, which gets rounded up to 36,133 1024bps-units, actually consuming 37,000,192bps of the available 100Mbps.  edit: Dug up notes; it was on IOS GSR."

networking,3drkvl,_squibby_,2,Sun Jul 19 01:50:47 2015 UTC,"QoS doesn't ""kick in"" during congestion. It's always running. For example, a 'priority' statement in a QoS configuration in a Cisco router will send prioritized packets first regardless of utilization rates.  QoS also shares unused bandwidth between queues (with the exception of a queue using 'priority police') when bandwidth demands rise above the minumum guarantee they have been allotted.  When bandwidth demands exceed what is available, QoS rations bandwidth to ensure queues get their guaranteed minimums, delaying traffic in buffers and dropping traffic after the buffers are filled.  QoS is just a system of queues and buffers. You really only notice its effects when it has to start delaying packets due to insufficient bandwidth.  Edit - in the effort to explain simply, I used ""queue"" interchangeably with ""class"" here, hence ""queues and buffers"". Realistically, queueing in QoS is the act of buffering, but we also commonly refer to the classes of traffic we assign as ""queues"". It's important to separate the technical terminology from the casual when talking about QoS."
networking,3drkvl,Electr0freak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:12:14 2015 UTC,"QoS is always running, but the router will not ""queue"" packets, priority queue or otherwise, until the tx-ring is full and there's no where else to place a waiting packet for transmission.  This is where the ""kicking in"" is coming from.  If you have a 100mbit ethernet interface and you've applied a queuing policy to that interface, it doesn't do you any good if the device on the opposite end of the link (like an ISP gateway) is rate-limiting your transmission to 10mbit.   IOS will only prioritize one packet for transmission over another if those different packets are placed in different respective queues, and that doesn't happen until the tx-ring is full."
networking,3drkvl,VA_Network_Nerd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:50:48 2015 UTC,"Queue isn't the right term perhaps as it implies buffering. Classification is a better way to describe the behavior, but I wanted to keep it a little more ELI5.  Yes, as long as wire speed is available, there is no 'queueing' to speak of. Regardless traffic is still being classified and policed (another poor term because I'm talking about applying a policy such as set dscp) regardless of whether the link is congested or not."

Any QoS rules will handle how these frames are prioritized for every ""tick"" or for that matter which frames to discard in case the uplink egress queue has no more room left."
networking,3drkvl,Apachez,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:11:33 2015 UTC,"Yes but those are ingress buffers.

networking,3drkvl,kombiwombi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:00:53 2015 UTC,"It can still be picked up faster if prioritized from the input buffer.  A packet can be prioritized at three stages:   Input Main processing Output   at each case a packet can be prioritized to get ahead of the current queue (either by placing it in high prio queues or by throwing something considerd to be less important out of one of the current queues).  Then depending on the hardware you use each of this stages can be better or worser in quality, I wouldnt be surprised if some equipment only can prioritize on the output queues."
networking,3drkvl,Apachez,2,Mon Jul 20 09:44:21 2015 UTC,"Actually 'prioritising' on egress only is the usual router behaviour for high-end hardware-based routers, and the only one required by the Differentiated Services QoS model.  For ingress queues we use a design strategy of ""speed up"" to ensure that ingress packets sent FIFO through the router's internal switching do not encounter congestion which is visible at the line rate of the egress interface. This vastly simplifies router design -- I've worked on ""fabrics"" with internal queuing and they are essentially routers within routers, with all the complexity that hints at.  Your point that any three-interface router can experience egress congestion is a good one. If you add a control plane then even a two-interface router is a three-interface router. So you can safely generalise to ""all routers can experience congestion"".  A common mistake is to think of QoS as just queuing. In reality the classification and marking of incoming traffic can be much more challenging than the egress queuing, both in router design and in QoS deployment.  The important point for the OP is that all this classification, marking and egress queuing happens regardless of congestion. It's just that egress queuing with an interface ready to transmit is trivial (although actually not short-cutted on hardware designs, as that requires far too much information to round-trip through the backplane)."
networking,3drkvl,DanSheps,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:58:40 2015 UTC,"I know that most devices only supports TX queuing, but this still gives that you (as hardware designer) can queue (that is in which order to handle the packets/frames) for both input aswell as the main process stage (where you apply PBR and whatelse) - that is if the hardware supports it. That is no matter if one choose to call it QoS, CoS, shaping, traffic prioritization or something else - what happens internally is that you have a buffer of x number of packets/frame to handle - the QoS (or whatever one might call it) is the feature within the hardware so that certain type of packets/frames can get VIP treatment (while others can be fully discriminated and just dropped in favour of more important VIP frames/packets).  Even if you cant ""QoS"" an input queue (since its not you who decides in which order the packet/frames arrive at) its still you who then (once the full frame has arrived, or if you are using cut-through - enough of information for the ip header has arrived) can choose which packet/frame you will process next in this input buffer which today can be several gigabyte large (if you use devices with deep buffers) to handle microbursts without losing data."

networking,3drkvl,_squibby_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:25:41 2015 UTC,"According to me?  You mean according to kombiwombi right?  That aside, CoS/ToS/DSCP/prioritization is related to the buffer & egress prioritization.  Shaping/Policing is related establishing a CIR and discarding or buffering traffic to remain within that CIR.  (Shaping doesn't always drop traffic, it buffers it so that the traffic flows at exactly the specified rate in the contract, not more).  CoS/etc is more related to congestion on the router/switch and allows some lower priority traffic to be dropped to ease congestion."

Depends.  If you're talking about hardware based queueing on a Cisco switch where you have a 1pXqYt structure, then yes... you're always pushing that CoS traffic into the priority queue.  But if you're referring to software based platforms this isn't true... you can oversubscribe the priority queue if there is no backpressure on the TX ring.  This is exactly why you can't simply purchase a 1G port and have a 50M CIR and slap on a QoS policy and expect it to work.  You have to pair it with a HQoS shaper to induce that backpressure."
networking,3drkvl,DanSheps,2,Sun Jul 19 19:55:13 2015 UTC,"Eh, this is what I get for trying to explain QoS ELI5-style.  Yes, as long as wire speed is available there's no need to alter packet order, and without a shaper the perceived speed is the link speed, not the actual CIR.  A better example would have been to refer to QoS behavior under a policy like set dscp. The point was to demonstrate that QoS isn't some dormant process that activates during congestion as it's a common misconception."

What I meant by SonicWALL's IPSEC setup was that:    The hub has essentially every network local to it  Spokes setup their VPN tunnel to be <Local LAN> to <every other network IP> and point back to the hub  Basically, it looks like they shovel all of the traffic back to the hub, and the hub re-routes that back down another VPN if you need cross-spoke communication   Where i see other setups just have <Spoke Lan> <Small Subnet block> < Hub > and the hub deals with handing out dynamic routing so the spokes know to go through it.

networking,3dnqm0,Luqq,5,Sat Jul 18 11:43:25 2015 UTC,"Use ULAs and globally unique addresses (GUAs). IPv6 was designed around having many different addresses attached, and it should be entirely reasonable to use ULAs for internal networking, while using global addresses for online access. If you loose Internet access all of your internal infrastructure should still work using ULAs, and won't require renumbering if you change ISPs or even use multiple.  If you have multiple ISPs, you will probably want to look at BGP and your own prefix like /u/CBRjack mentioned. This will mitigate time out problems because the IP that is attempting to be used isn't currently reachable."
networking,3dnqm0,Xipher,3,Fri Jul 17 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"All good advice here, so far.  The only gotcha being what if your ISPs don't want to do BGP with you.  /u/Xipher has good advice to use ULA's. These are kind of like RFC 1918 address space. Basically you have a randomly-generated /56 /48 internal prefix with a 16-bit network ID to make up the network address for each VLAN, subnet, whatever inside your network.  This matches up with the pubically-routable /56 prefixes you should be getting from an ISP. Now, enter Network Prefix Translation. Your public IPv6 addresses will take the same form as your ULA's just replacing the internal /56 /48 prefix with the public bits, leaving the /16 network ID and /64 host ID intact. NAT's not dead, baby!! :D"
networking,3dnqm0,megagram,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:06:09 2015 UTC,"Just a nitpick - I think you mean /48, not /56. ;)   (Standard ULA prefix length is /48.)"

networking,3dnqm0,IntellingetUsername,2,Sat Jul 18 09:47:24 2015 UTC,A /24 is the de-facto minimum for BGP in v4. The equivalent minimum in v6 is a /48.
networking,3dnqm0,profmonocle,2,Sat Jul 18 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"While mostly true, ISP's will accept smaller netblocks from a customer on a no-export basis. (they won't send it to their upstreams/peers).  If you have a /24 but want to have a /26 going to another site (but on the same ISP) you can advertised the /26 to them, but you will need to explicitly tell them that."
networking,3dnqm0,twlscil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:56:01 2015 UTC,With IPv6 there is no difficulty in getting a /48 from ARIN.  So really the only issue/roadblock is whether your ISP will do BGP with you or not.
networking,3do3dk,networknewjack,3,Fri Jul 17 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"Walls I'm running into with Icinga are basically drawing in bandwidth statistics and alerts based on those stats as well as (and this one is big) Netflow data retention and graphing.   The thing to remember is that Icinga is a fork of Nagios and chances are that if you see the problem in Icinga, it's probably in Nagios as well. To that end, my experience with Netflow and Nagios was infuriating at best and probably mirrors your experience with Icinga.  The only one that actually turned my crank in handling Netflow was PRTG. https://www.paessler.com/netflow_monitoring  Maybe there's something about Nagios and netflow that I don't get (and there probably is), but I couldn't make it worth my time."
networking,3do3dk,BourbonOverIP,3,Fri Jul 17 21:47:52 2015 UTC,Icinga 1 is a fork of nagios but Icinga 2 is not. Icinga2 works with graphite and sflow can be used for netflow monitoring. You can also build alerts in both ways between graphite and icinga 2.
networking,3do3dk,TechIsCool,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:33:23 2015 UTC,"As I understood it, sfow and Netflow are entirely different things. Netflow is cisco proprietary where sflow is the open source and much better version of Netflow. The only cisco devices I am aware of that support sflow are some nx-os devices and a few in the nexus line. In my current situation I would have to manually create a bunch of scripts to interpret the Netflow data from an export out of something like nfdump if I wanted to integrate it into graphite... at least that's my current understanding.

networking,3dpmqd,Apachez,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:28:16 2015 UTC,"Except that you shouldnt use VLAN1 and normally set the gateway for a network to be the first or last hostaddress (not counting network or broadcast address) and not something random such as .80 (just personal opinion but I know many of us prefers it that way) it should work from the 2626 point of view.  That is (to sum your configuration up):  VLAN1: 192.168.168.5.80/23  VLAN50: 192.168.10.1/23  ip route 0.0.0.0/0 192.168.5.252  Verify that client(s) use the correct subnetmask and that they can ping their defgw 192.168.10.1 - do the same for the proxyside that it has correct ip and subnet set and that it can ping 192.168.168.5.80.  If the above worked out you can also test the same from the 2626 that it can ping a client at VLAN50 (192.168.10.x or 192.168.11.x) and that it can ping the proxy at VLAN1 (192.168.5.252). Verify arp-tables so the correct mac-addresses shows up there.  Now you can move on to verify routing on each host, start with the clients.  The clients should have a default route towards 192.168.10.1, verify through ""netstat -rn"".  Now do the same on the proxy - I assume your proxy is dualhomed (two nics, like one inside and one outside) so verify that it got a default route towards internet or whatever you will be using it for. But also (not uncommon that people miss this at their first attempt) put in a static route (in the proxyserver) that is something similar to (so it can find the client(s)):  ip route 192.168.10.0/23 192.168.5.80  If you did the above you should now be able to from a client at 192.168.10.0/23 ping the proxy ip at 192.168.5.252 and get a reply back.  If you still dont get a reply back verify so you dont have a local firewall on the client and/or the proxyserver that perhaps prohibits pings.  If you use linux you can verify this by:  iptables -L -v -n  and  iptables -L -v -n -t nat  You can also run tcpdump/wireshark/tshark on the clients and most preferly the proxyserver to verify if an icmp echo request is sent and if an icmp echo reply is sent back on the correct interface.  Edit: Besides, a good hint would be to download and install latest available firmware which can be downloaded from:  https://h10145.www1.hp.com/downloads/SoftwareReleases.aspx?ProductNumber=J4900A  Note: read the readme-files included. Some older HP Procurve series must be updated in specific steps (like you cant just throw in the latest H.10.115 if you got a really old firmware already installed, you must first update to H.08.98 followed by a reboot and then install H.10.115 followed by a reboot)."

You don't have any untagged ports, so any device that's trying to communicate on that Vlan would need to tag its own packets. Is the proxy tagging its packets?

A bit more detail on spann0r's suggested change, though - the reason that ASA1 should peer with RTR2's external IP is because that's going to be the source address on the encrypted packets that it receives, due to RTR2's NAT.  So, more details about the NAT would help. Can you post the NAT config on ASA1? Actually.. considering the output of that packet tracer, just post the whole running config if possible. And after initiating traffic from PC-1 -> PC-2, issue 'show xlate' on ASA1 and 'show ip nat translations' on RTR1, post the output of those as well.

So I went to the 'Shack and at the door they handed me one of those bags you use for bagging leaves and said only ""$20 for a full bag. $10 for half. Have fun!""  I grabbed everything useful in the store (which by that point it was admittedly fairly picked over) including all of their batteries.  Final bill of everthing was like $1,260.

With the /24 mask you have currently the addresses are all in the same space -- you can fix this by changing the masks and/or by changing the addresses.

If you're going to exceed 52 ports or 230 watts, then I would add on another 24 port 1 Gbps version of the pizza boxes. If you get with a decent VAR, they should be able to do both switches under $3,000.  I wouldn't complicate it anymore than that. The more you can keep on one switch, the better.

Although, I've been told many, many times before that ""performance"" of a switch is a non-issue, since there will almost never be a time where the rate of transfer from machine to machine will be limited by the switches, instead of something higher up on the OSI model on one of the computers. Basically, that switch performance is negligible in the network performance equation. (Though reliability definitely isn't.)  One thing I struggle with when looking at switches is having any idea how to compare them. Sure, I can compare the user interface, the number of ports.

networking,3dmq0b,dotwaffle,5,Fri Jul 17 23:31:56 2015 UTC,"He saying the opposite. When you realise you're in over your head, calling for help is the best way to do things. People who realise this and are not afraid of saying it advance to the next interview.  No one wants to have a ""superstar"" on his team that never ever asks for help. The day there is an outage and the guy is too proud to call someone else, the outage will probably last a lot longer and impact the business more severely than if help is called quickly."

networking,3dlxhz,futureb1ues,2,Fri Jul 17 10:07:18 2015 UTC,"The key thing is that all your devices currently on your network are using IP addresses in the range 10.97.116.1 - 10.97.116.128.  If so, then yes, you can change the subnet mask at your leisure.  However, if your plan is to change the mask so you can immeditaly start using those addresses above .128 then you will have some intermittent communication problems with addresses above .128 and devices using the old subnet mask.  Best to just push through and change the mask on all your equipment before using any of those addresses above .128  Yes, you could use a router to facilitate some communication between devices with the old subnet mask and the new subnet mask, but this can result in some weird asymmetrical behavior that can cause havoc, especially if the router is also a stateful firewall  (eg: SOHO UTM gateway) since asymmetrical traffic doesn't look normal in terms of TCP states.  IE, if traffic is initiated from one subnet mask, it ""works"" but the firewall sees a ton of incomplete connections.  If traffic is initiated in the other direction it doesn't work at all because the firewall sees SYN-ACK packets without having a connection for which they're associated, so it drops them.  Simple traffic like ICMP echo-reply (pings) will appear to work just fine (even though the traffic technically will be flowing in a circle), but anything complex won't work at all."

networking,3dmv3u,Ttthhhccc,3,Fri Jul 17 15:41:01 2015 UTC,"I recently had some quotes for a N4064F and S4048-ON that were very close in price (~$7k range each). In fact, Dell actually swapped S4048-ON switches in for a bid because ""the S4048 is a more capable switch at approximately the same price"" (their words).  The only thing favorable for the N4064F is the warranty in my mind, but buying a S4048 with a 5 yr warranty gives you 4 years to not worry and 1 year to be annoyed at Dell warranty extension emails - a small price to pay.  Our currently outstanding order(s) are for the S4048-ON instead of the N series because we believe they're more flexible in the end. In particular we got the -ON versions as we're an research university and play with various other network OS / OpenFlow / etc from time to time. In reality we'll likely just run Dell's DNOS on these (which is supported on the -ON versions now, or so we've been told). I'll note we haven't actually received any yet -- delayed due to chipset shortages apparently, but this only affects the -ON version from what I've been told. Should be shipping in a few weeks from what we've heard.  For us, the S series just made sense in our research environment, and we do plan to use all 6 40Gb ports as well so that's a bonus. If you really don't need the 40Gb ports right now, and don't need OpenFlow / other network OS options, I would honestly stick with the cheaper N4064F. If your shop does grow and needs 40GB in the future, just use the $ you save towards an S6000 or equivalent.  FWIW I've been using a few N4032, N3048, and S4810 (running FTOS) for quite a bit now, and despite the N series being marketed as the cheaper non-datacenter route they aren't bad and have been fine to work with.  ... and scratch my comments on reversible airflow only in the S series, as I see it got mentioned just now by someone else.  So with your new info, of not needing 40Gb other than stacking, no airflow requirements, and no alternative OS shenanigans I would vote N4064F."

Don't make this anymore complicated than it needs to be.   You have such a small network that you're not going to gain much by breaking things out. Make three VLANs: one for workstations, one for VoIP phones and one for everything else. Don't buy routers, buy layer 3 switches instead if you really need routing at each location (HP makes some decently priced ones) - that being said, I really doubt you do. Think about where the traffic is going - most traffic is LAN/WAN - what type of traffic are you trying to stop from crossing buildings? Server traffic? VoIP traffic to a call manager?

I mapped it out to make sure I understand what you're saying:  http://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/8556681  What's your opinion of the HP 1910 series switches? Looks like they're L2 with some L3 features. This client is a non-profit with a limited budget and these are well priced. We've used them before in other offices with some simple VLAN needs and they seem to work great. Can I use these in the 4 main spots - right behind the firewall, and as the main switch at each spot?  If not, what affordable switches would you recommend?  As you can see in the updated map, a lot of the workstations and phones are not directly connected to the main switch, but to a smaller switch that then runs back to the main switch for that location. This is because most of these locations are made up of 3 or 4 small offices in a cluster which have a single line run back to the main switch for that location.  Do these smaller switches need to be managed, or can we use simple unmanaged switches at this level? We're planning on putting the server and workstations at the untagged VLAN 1 for simplicity. The VOIP phones will be doing the VLAN tagging directly so the port on the smaller switches won't have to be capable of tagging.  Does that make any sense?  Again, I appreciate the help. I'm brushing up on my OSI model, and obviously need to devote more time to learning routing and switching. We're being asked to handle more complex setups than we have in the past."
networking,3djkf5,Legionof1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:47:55 2015 UTC,Basically any time you want to deal with Vlans you have to have a managed switch. Most unmanaged switches will not pass VLANs.   I would eliminate those minor switches if possible.   I don't have any experience with the 1910 switches unfortunately. I run Powerconnect/Force10. For a L2 switch a 2800 series does the job for cheap but I think the N series will have a replacement for it.  Personally if I was building this network I would have the L2 switches be something like an N1500 series and something like an S55 for a core switch.

networking,3djkf5,Oderdigg,2,Fri Jul 17 18:54:42 2015 UTC,Depending on the switch (and licensing) you may be able to enable Layer 3 routing.  You would need to either: 1) Forward DHCP requests 2) Have a local router  I would honestly just get a different /24 for each location (I am assuming you are not using public /24's).  Keep the one /24 at the main location and then use different ones at each branch.
networking,3djkf5,ser_rhaegar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"You don't need the routers if you have layer 2 connectivity between firewall/switches. I would however have 1 router between FW and switches and I would get multi-layer access switches. On those multi-layer switches, I would setup the SVI's for each branch so all localized traffic stays on that switch.  You can internally use any RFC1918 address you want so you're not limited to one 1 class C and I would have it like this;  172.16.0.0/20 = site 1 172.16.16.0/20 = site 2 172.16.32.0/20 = site 3  and so on."
networking,3djkf5,IDA_noob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"I figure that a bit more information is called for.  This business has new VOIP phones from another provider. This provider has these phones all over the campus and they seem to work fine. The particular company that we work with has some call quality issues. We have our firewall, an Untangle, set to prioritize VOIP traffic... we have a number of VOIP clients behind these firewalls with no problem, including our own office.  The tech for the VOIP provider thinks that it's unnecessary noise on the network that's causing the call quality issues. He suggested segmenting the three locations. He hasn't been able or willing to verify the ports his system is using... one thought I had is that if their VOIP system is using non-standard ports, then our firewall may not be bypassing the data like I think it is.  In any case, I'm liking the idea of putting the VOIP phones on their own VLAN. That, plus the QOS on the firewall, should eliminate any interference from the PCs, right?  In a few cases, there is one cable that plugs into the VOIP phone, then the PC is plugged into the passthrough port on the phone. In this case, if we set VLAN tagging on the phone itself, will I be able to have the PC on the untagged VLAN 1 and the phone on the tagged VLAN? Or is the phone going to tag all of the data passing through it, including traffic from the attached PC?  So, basically I'm looking at replacing their unmanaged switches with HP 1910 series switches and turning on the VLAN for the phones. If we then need to actually segment the 3 locations into different subnets, we'll have that ability, but it does seem unnecessary for a network with only about 25 devices.  Thanks!"
networking,3djkf5,d00bianista,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:25:12 2015 UTC,"Having a separate voice vlan sounds like the best and simplest solution. You can get managed switches which allow you to configure an access vlan and a voice vlan on the same port. When a phone connects it will use the voice vlan and when a computer connects direct or through the phone switch, it will use the access vlan. This may be dependent on the phone supporting it as well.  I would also take a phone to the central closet and unplug the three sites and plug in the phone. See if the call quality is good or not before making changes as you don't really know where the quality issue is originating from."

To me, noise is something I see in logs, like traffic that is seemingly superfluous that makes it difficult to have a true sense of what is going on in the network, and in that sense, I guess log traffic could be viewed as superfluous, but only if you are reviewing logs in the first place, which would make it a very meta complaint (This log traffic is making it really difficult to read this log report that was generated by all this log traffic.) and at any rate, isn't that what filters and report parameters are for?  EDIT:  I do recognize that some log sources are heavier than others, but that should be factored into design.  Don't collect those sources live over a WAN.  Collect them locally and have them compressed and sent over the WAN during the off hours.  You still keep a repository in your central site, but you don't collect to your central site in real time for the heaviest sources.  You can still set up alerting and have certain events forwarded to the central site in real time.

networking,3di0kj,Fridge-Largemeat,9,Thu Jul 16 12:58:07 2015 UTC,"Some general notes when it comes to MTU...  Don't filter ICMP traffic to/from devices and networks.  It breaks PMTU detection and breaks TCP/IP in unexpected ways.  I know that all these 'security people' say to block ICMP to prevent scans and probing, but lets be bluntly honest - they are idiots.  Security through obscurity is a load of crap, and in this case breaks connections.   In IPv6, ICMP is mandatory and if you try to block it, nothing will work correctly.  I suspect it was done that way on purpose (hint hint).  If your firewall devices support mss clamping or adjustment, use it.  VPN tunnels lower MTU between links unless the links use baby jumbos or higher.  Usually on Cisco devices, this is around 1400.  PPPoE connections go to 1492.  Take the max MTU of a link, minus 40, and you have your MSS (ie PPPoE will be a MSS of 1452).  Remember that MTU and MSS can be different going each direction.  The workarounds/fixes have to be done on each side."

(Ours are now 1410)    Part of the reason for the intermittency is that not every protocol is going to attempt to send packets over 1396 or whatever your limit is.  In our case, we had 3 machines out of 6 failing to open HTTPS sites on the LAN (across a VPN), but HTTP worked fine...  A packet analyzer showed us that the Kerberos packets were 1500 bytes, and because of the VPN, they were always set to ""do not fragment"".  The cable modem between was dropping them.  The other three machines still had valid KRB tokens, so they didn't need to re-negotiate their credentials.  Two other posters have correctly given you a valid test for MTU problems, by using the Ping command with DNF and a large size.  Test it!"

If it pings, it might help.    Next step up would to try and figure out what the maximum MTU you can get through the path is.  Keep upping the packet size till you get the needs to be fragmented message.    It could be that something is breaking the PMTUD process from the client to the server.  I ran into this issue all the time with websites being inaccessible for some sites and not others because the site/client would send back a packet that was too big with the don't fragment bit set and a router in the path did what it did best - dropped it.    There are ways you can correct this on the network equipment so that you don't have to hit each client.  Not sure about the stuff you have, but MTU MSS is what you are looking for.    The issue is just like you describe, some stuff will work, some things won't.  MTU is a fun thing to debug."
networking,3di0kj,Jimbob0i0,3,Thu Jul 16 13:48:59 2015 UTC,The best way of tracking down MTU issues is using pings of specific sizes with the do not fragment bit set...  How to do this will vary by operating system (do some googling for those terms).  Start high and drop it until you no longer get dropped packets and your ping responses are consistent.  Then configure your environment so the size traversing the network does not exceed that...
networking,3di0kj,PE1NUT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:54:14 2015 UTC,"The only thing to add to that: try to understand -why- you run into trouble above (or below) certain packet sizes, and see if you can find and fix (or eliminate) the culprit.  In a well designed network, the MTU is a property of the broadcast domain (subnet), shared by all machines on that subnet,  and you should not have to worry about it even when crossing into other network domains."
networking,3di0kj,Oderdigg,6,Thu Jul 16 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"MTU and performance go hand and hand. If you have the wrong value, your performance will suffer.  Site to site VPN (using Cisco) uses GRE encapsulation which adds overhead to the IP header. For regular GRE, it's 24 bytes of padding and 28 bytes for mGRE or Multipoint GRE if you are doing DMVPN. If you do not set your MTU to accommodate this, you will fragment your packets and that will suck performance out of your network. You would also have to set your tcp-adjust mss value to be 40 bytes lower than your MTU, 1436 for GRE and 1432 for mGRE.  You can test this before making any changes by pinging each end of the tunnel with forced packet size and the ""DF"" bit set (Do not Fragment).  ping 10.10.0.1 -l 1500 -f (Windows command, forces packet of 1500 and -f is for the DF bit) ping 10.10.0.1 size 1500 df-bit  Too high and you'll get timeouts. Once you find the highest MTU size that doesn't fragment, that's your MTU value on the tunnels. The tcp-adjust value will allow clients to send packets at 1500 bytes while still sending over a tunnel with a smaller MTU value.  I fixed a performance issue with a 300M fiber line based on this. We were getting 120MB/sec full-duplex max and when I set the MTU to 1476 and MSS to 1436, performance went to 250MB/sec full-duplex."
networking,3di0kj,DexTsarII,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:19:09 2015 UTC,Just wanted to point out that s2s doesn't use GRE. GRE is a method to encapsulate multicast to be than transferred over s2s. You can have tons of s2s tunnels and not a single GRE instance. Those two things are completely separate that are brought together for DMVPN. OP didn't mention a single thing about DMVPN or GRE. We can assume that his network is setup that way but only he can answer.
networking,3di0kj,Oderdigg,0,Thu Jul 16 16:58:20 2015 UTC,I don't think that's right. I have point to point and multipoint and the single point to point does use GRE.

A major difference is that GRE tunnels allow multicast packets to traverse the tunnel whereas IPSec VPN does not support multicast packets. In large networks where routing protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP are necessary, GRE tunnels are your best bet. For this reason, plus the fact that GRE tunnels are much easier to configure, engineers prefer to use GRE rather than IPSec VPN.   So GRE is better than PSK which is why we don't use it. mGRE is even better.  I suggest you try be nice and stop acting like a dick."

networking,3di0kj,DexTsarII,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:23:53 2015 UTC,Again. You need GRE to encapsulate multicast. Without multicast routing protocols such as OSPF and EIGRP won't work over s2s.   How do you think Cisco ASA does s2s? Those firewalls don't support GRE...
networking,3di0kj,DexTsarII,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:11:43 2015 UTC,"Here is what it states in that link about GRE. You need to read the whole paper not just a line out of each paragraph....  Network redundancy (resiliency) is an important consideration in the decision to use GRE tunnels, IPSec tunnels, or tunnels which utilize IPSec over GRE. GRE can be used in conjunction with IPSec to pass routing updates between sites on an IPSec VPN. GRE encapsulates the clear text packet, then IPSec (in transport or tunnel mode) encrypts the packet.This packet flow of IPSec over GRE enables routing updates, which are generally multicast, to be passed over an encrypted link. IPSec alone can not achieve this, because it does not support multicast.  In addition to this you can run GRE tunnnels without IPSEC at all."

The customer buys 600 pieces of Cisco gear to monitor the critical systems, etc. You're totally comfortable with recommending that they install these out of the box with no testing prior to operation? You expect it to work, right? Furthermore, if the customer does want testing by setting it all up and allowing it to operate for a few weeks before putting it in, you're totally OK with allocating the resources to manage six hundred pieces of equipment to run the tests completely free to the customer?   Edit: I should also add that for many high risk clients like aviation, medical, some military, and financial, if you as a vendor recommend putting networking gear into these environments without proving the hardware is good you're likely to loose a customer (to put it mildly).

With that having said doing a burn-in for lets say 24 or even 48 hours doesnt necessary mean that the device will survive all its lifetime at the customer site - it just means that you wont have to face a dissapointed customer who received another DOA from you and because of that must push back their start of the new service with another 1-2 weeks (along with the extra time for you to handle this DOA by traverling back to customer site, perform troubleshooting, decide if the customer can wait a few days for replacement from vendor of if you will take a replacement from your own stock, visit the customer site a third time - hoping its not another DOA you are setting up etc)."

That is not only difference phases but also different ""suppliers"" (for example one set of powerconnectors which goes to the local UPS and one set which doesnt, in case the UPS has a meltdown - make sure you properly connect your dual PSU equipment so they doesnt sit on the same ""side"").  The ERP's are so cheap (about $350/each) so you can get 4 of them and put into VRRP along with having 2 or more on the shelf as cold standbys for a fraction of the cost comparing to Cisco or Juniper solutions.  But of course there are some things with the current ERP's which could be interpreted as ""downside"" (depending on your needs):   Single PSU (not a biggie - see above). Currently no 10G interfaces (which means they are currently only suitable for 1Gbps deployments). Not modular (you get what you see :-) No expensive supportcosts.   That last is rather a good thing but some enterprises wants someone to blame at or for that matter get help from when their own staff is uneducated/lacks competence/experience. On the other hand there are resellers of Ubiquiti-equipment that offers extra support if needed (could be good as 2nd line support even if you got staff that knows what they are doing).  I think getting ERP into 10G world would be the most favorable thing Ubiqiuti could do and second put in another PSU to shutup those single PSU haters =)  It would be a dream if they could release a hardware that have 8 or even 12 SFP/SFP+ dualports. That is so you can choose if you want to use 10/100/1000/10000 copper or put in a 1G or 10G SFP/SFP+ and it would be happy with that - ohh and to a price thats close to $350/each :-)  Hey The Stig, any news on this subject yet? :-)"

Number of PSUs is relevant in a data centre because data centres tend to hold business-critical services for which any downtime is important. If a 5sec downtime for your data centre routers causes half your IP phones to reboot then I'd say that's way too long for something as relatively minor as a brief power outage on one data centre supply.   Also in order for dual PSU to do any good you need A+B power to your racks and not just A+A or such.   Again, I thought we were talking data centres not a cupboard with a few PCs stacked up in it all hanging off a single extension cable. Have you got data centres without A+B power?

Im not saying that dual PSU is a bad thing, Im saying its not a major ""issue"" to hook up onto. I prefer having two devices in a redundant pair any day than having no devices at all because you ran out of budget. Or for that matter use the best devices available to optimize your costs and put in money where they are actually needed.  Of course the ERP's doesnt fit in all situations, for example if you need 10Gbit interface today (which on the other hand can be resolved by using ""router on a stick"" design but meh)."

Management is via SNMP.     The problems with the current batch of white box switches are:   The infrastructure required to support them has a large footprint.  The only practical design I've seen so far requires a full openstack deployment or giving cumulus networks a bunch of money every year and designing the puppet repository to manage the switches. Linux userland software is not built around the requirements of an enterprise networking device.  There's a reason why Cisco and Broadcom use only the kernel in their Linux-based products.  Being able to install shell scripts on the switches is not a good idea for long term maintainability, and I'm saying that as someone who's spent thousands of hours making bash do weird stuff.  It's great for servers, terrible for network gear. Lack of talent capable of managing the switches.  They're highly customizable and geared towards sites with thousands of ports.  If you're not doing a cutting edge datacenter you're probably going to be learning as you go. If you already have to do an openflow deployment, why not just get an existing enterprise switch that supports openflow?  That way you can take advantage of the large secondary market for parts.

We are going to play on how BGP works, BGP will not advertise a route via the network statement, unless the route is in the routing table.  From router A, you will advertise local networks to router B, router B will receive the route, set a BGP community, and set the weight higher than 32768 (default for local routes).  You will then set your backup routes to have a higher metric than iBGP (higher than 200), and filter all route advertisements with the BGP community you set above.  What this will do is, as long as the route is received from router A, router B will not advertise that route to the internet.

This is an expensive design approach, to be sure.    But routing sometimes demands fancy packet forwarding, or traffic shaping decisions.  Firewalls tend to not be very good at this task. Traffic filtering just simply demands a proper, purpose-built firewall device.    Cisco's IOS Zone-Based Firewall is interesting, but only as a crude filtering mechanism.    So, you need 100Mbps of real routing performance, with I'm sure some Access-Lists, and maybe some QoS.    The Cisco 4331 router supports 100Mbps of routing by default.  It can be upgraded with a Performance License to support 300Mbps of routing.    The 4331 router Security Bundle retails for around $2700 new.    http://www.cdw.com/shop/products/Cisco-ISR-4331-Security-Bundle-router-rack-mountable/3522946.aspx?pfm=srh    http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-4331-Router-ISR4331-SEC-K9/dp/B00Q8STN24    After those routers, you'll want a good firewall device.

Let a Firewall or UTM filter out what actual traffic flows to permit across that connectivity.  They excel at that task.

Sonicwalls are hardly ""home grade"" but they're not ""best of breed"" either and the HA has a serious tendency to suck and just die without ACTUALLY dying, but that's more of an ISP issue than it is a sonicwall issue, because Watchguards do the same thing, as do Cisco devices.

networking,3dfya4,incudie,21,Thu Jul 16 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"Before I launch into why I think Sonicwall can sometimes be a bad product, you have to realize that this is cyclical.  Before the hate was on Sonicwall, it was on Fortinet. Before it was on Fortinet, it was on the Cisco ASA. Before it was on the Cisco ASA, it was on CheckPoint. Before Checkpoint, it was on Netfilter/IPCop/IPtables, etc.  The problem with Sonicwall is that the 3600 and 2600 are really the only Sonicwalls that ""fit"". The TZ series are too underpowered to really be effective for it's target: the small SMB. This is especially true given the cost - you're probably better of with one of the other UTMs for SMBs. Anything bigger than a 3600 is too underpowered to be effective for a large organization - you're probably better off with something from Juniper or Palo Alto.  Sonicwall can be praised for handling 80% of the use cases very well. The problem is that most organizations during their lifetime will fall into a use case that SonicWall doesn't handle very well - /u/saphert has a good example in SIP trunks. My own experiences comes from trying to get OSPF over VPN to work effectively to make dynamic VPN tunnels - it's a pain to configure and is generally unreliable. Another admin I know deployed SonicPoints in conjunction with the Sonicwalls, and even with support from Dell, took an additional 2 months to get up and running due to firmware and configuration issues."
networking,3dfya4,BourbonOverIP,16,Wed Jul 15 23:47:38 2015 UTC,Dell's support for Sonicwall has been abysmal.
networking,3dfya4,AngryCod,6,Thu Jul 16 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"More than abysmal, but I find that is par for the course outside of their server and desktop lines. I once put Dell's AppAssure team into an argument with their SonicWall team. Both sides blamed each other, and if it wasn't for the fact that our production backup system wouldn't work, it would have been hilarious."
networking,3dfya4,BourbonOverIP,5,Thu Jul 16 03:39:43 2015 UTC,"I've worked at 2 different companies that had Sonic Walls deployed somewhere on the network. Both of them I had bad experiences.  For 6 months when we adopted the portion of our IT network that supports payment center connections back to our Enterprise core, we had to deal with a mix of SonicWall TZ100s/200s at ~18 of our stores. Our desktop team had to update all the thin clients to corporate standard to accommodate the change.  Now all of our other stores still have, or had Juniper SSG5 Firewalls, or small Cisco ASA 5505s.  The purpose of them was to simply vpn the store back into the VPN concentrators in our enterprise datacenters. They carried some voice, ordinary billing data, and thats it. Not asking them to do much, except some of these payment centers had training rooms built in so they had to take on some bigger demand, and the ASAs and SSGs handled it no problem. They just provided a simple internet connection and we had to create static routes for the billing servers at each site. Each site just had a dumb L2 24 port HP Procurve sitting behind these firewalls for access.  The Sonicwalls? Everyday, I would come into work in the morning to see our snmp tools just littered with alarms from the sonic walls. The worst of them are chassis down alarms because some of them would randomly decide to reboot from these ""fcp bad entry handle"" errors they would throw. We found out that the garbage ASICs can't take the flooding from the thin clients in the store when they would shut down for the day and dump their data to the server. This was a clusterfuck for a few weeks trying to figure out what was causing this. The problem was, before the thinclient turns off, it sends all of it's collected data from the day on flash to the server. Because they would crash people would come in the next day complaining of all their lost data, settings, cat pictures, etc from the previous day. This meant, at closing time, users would have to shut down one thinclient at a time starting with front counter units then any back office units. So store closing sucked for them because they would have to wait an extra ~30 minutes a day for all the workstations to shutdown.  I wasn't too keen on using the GMS management software we were forced to use either, even when connecting locally it was laggy. ""I'm glad we saved some pocket change by going with the cheaper option here, now if we can get them to pay for the gas wasted tripping out to stores for support..."""
networking,3dfya4,Gorath,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:18:21 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of the same experiences.  For instance, we had a pair of NSA 250s at a site. If you passed more than 25 Mbps of traffic through the device, it would drop ping packets, stop responding to SNMP queries and hold the management console until the traffic subsided. Like clockwork, anytime WSUS pushed out patches the firewall would disappear for a few hours.  We use Observium for the monitoring of Sonicwalls because GMS wasn't giving us accurate information. All I wanted to know was what the total traffic per day was on the WAN interface. GMS couldn't accurately give me that number. Even after spending hours with Sonicwall support reps, they still couldn't get the engine to report properly. Then their sales reps wanted us to increase our license to handle configuration management too. No thanks!  Getting the thing into Observium wasn't a pretty sight either. We would get random alerts that the appliances were down because even though we checked, ""Increase SNMP subsystem priority"", it would just randomly decide to stop responding to SNMP."
networking,3dfya4,BourbonOverIP,5,Thu Jul 16 02:12:50 2015 UTC,"I've seen points like this (and those continued below in the thread) a lot. There is definitely a case for 'underpowered' at the TZ level, if you're going to flip on all the power-hungry featurettes of the UTM's. But in which case you should be aware of the potential loading after some initial tests.   The bigger problem I saw though is watching guys who knew how to work with Cisco / Juniper gear work with Sonicwalls - they're fine with the Cisco stuff we have obviously (most of the time) but it was clear some couldn't figure the Sonicwalls out a lot of the time even if they said they were fine with it, especially the edge routers, then ascribe their own lack of ability to configure to deficiencies in the device. When I / someone else put it right, it's 'oh, but it still sucks'.   Bear in mind I'm not a networking tech, all I do is own small redundant datacentres and have a <10-man IT team spread out among them, but watching otherwise experienced networking / IT techs time after time it seems a lot of people have real difficulty in adapting.  Now there's also potentially some truth to the 'Maybe Sonicwall isn't a priority for Dell now' aspect, as we've seen from the firmware release schedule, but I can't say it's been an operational issue yet. Maybe it will be in the future, who knows."

I'm actually about to start configuring OSPF over sonicwall GRE tunnels so this kind of scares me the part about unreliable...

networking,3dfya4,HDClown,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:00:40 2015 UTC,"Haven't used them, but the new TZ models look like they should solve the under-powered problem for SMB UTM's.  Fortinet's small device offering is very similar to SonicWALL in this space.  They've released some new models in the range that must have some dedicated hardware to handle UTM features with much higher throughput, but they are sacrificing some overall general stateful packet inspection throughput because of it.  I don't think that's a bad thing though.  I have 30 TZ200/TZ205's deployed and they work fine as a whole, but they are not licensed for UTM services.  The problem I have is with how buggy SonicOS Enhanced has become.  5.9 doesn't fix bugs still in 5.8, bugs that been around for well over a year.  It's like they have given up on 5.8/5.9.  These aren't bugs I hit all the time, but when I do, I just want to strangle someone.  I don't have any devices that use 6.x firmware, but I don't think there is anything revolutionary about 6.x vs 5.8 and 5.9, but maybe I'm wrong.  I hope I'm wrong.  I'd like to forklift to something else at this point.  I don't have any confidence in Dell to improve things."

Granted I only work with them through my customers, but they are a time sink to setup properly. Sonicwall support seems to be completely lacking as well. They seem to think that SIP Transformations ALWAYS has to be on, despite being given different configs showing the opposite.   Personally I prefer Fortigate or Cisco. It's way less of a hassle to setup, both offer a solid CLI, and support is pretty amazing. Fortigate gets the edge here, as we reported a bug in their fw that dropped RTP packets on a re-INVITE off hold. They not only responded, they gave us a patch for it that fixed it within hours."

You can't configure these to automatically backup settings via FTP. GMS is way too expensive to be worth while at my size.  Dell needs to come up with a free or reduced cost GMS option. HA is not stateful, all VPN's, TCP sessions, etc need to be renegotiated on HA failover. Support sucks. If you use the wizards your configs and policies will get needlessly messy.  Don't use the wizards. Sometimes a VPN will drop and refuse to automatically renegotiate without disabling and reenabling the policy on the far side.  This happens on a small subset of my devices randomly. You can't export a logging config and import it into another unit.  Netflow functionality is meh at best.  Sometimes it stops working.  The Netflow v9 and IPFX templates are poorly documented.   What I like.   As a basic router/firewall the TZ's work for me without issues. Logging is actually pretty decent in 5.9. HA works exactly as described. I have a lower than expected death rate in a very hot and humid environment. You can compare live packet captures between a TZ and a NSA and then export them to a .pcap file. I actually like the object based configuration model they use.  Using groups you can greatly reduce the number of NAT and firewall policies.   Pointers.   Use groups strategically. Prepend all service groups with ""SVG-"", services ""SV-"", address objects ""AO-"", address object groups ""AOG-"", VPN's ""VPN-"", etc.  This helps ALOT when deciphering NAT policies at a glance.  Even better, just use a naming scheme that makes sense and stick with it. Setup logging on all firewall and nat policy changes, its not enabled by default."

You can turn ALL of them off for a zone, but not a handful of them. This causes us a lot of headaches because of our legacy public IP range. It makes migrating to a private range much harder than it needs to be. This is on a pair of HA E5500s running the latest available firmware.  Also compared to Palo Alto firewalls their Layer-7 stuff is not good.  I do agree that the Full DPI throughput is very nice for the money. I would say that is a major selling point. Great for PCI DSS environments in that regard."

Different security modules scan different sections of the data stream based on the content.  In addition to that, the most recent NSS NGIPS report showed how effective the security is on the FortiGates.  Also the FortiGate datasheets state (although it is in small writing) what the performance numbers are based on.  Most of the time it's 44K HTTP packets.  To your point, the datasheets only reflect the performance with a specific security module turned on.    However, I have verified via BreakingPoint tests that those numbers are legit.  I have also found in the field that if you buy the FortiGate that is the same price of the comparable vendor, the FortiGate typically comes out on top.  Full disclosure:  I am an SE for Fortinet."

The 240 network was recently changed to 50mb fiber from coax and they crap out from speed tests.  This environment uses security services (content filter and app control) but with performance optimized enabled.    One of the 220 networks is just a wan and lan, with no security services (performance optimized) and was recently changed 50mb fiber from a 10mb fiber.  The device craps out when the wan is saturated.  I both cases we are not getting anywhere close to advertised (~600mbps) throughput for our devices.  By crap out I mean we see ping drops, the admin panel becomes unresponsive, and the cores are at 95%+ usage.

On the Fortigates, it was a plain-text file, which meant I could actually peruse the config file.  This can't be done on Sonicwall. We have about 40 pages of  address objects.  It is not possible to search for an address.  You have to scroll through all 40 pages, press ctrl-f to have the browser search the current page, and then move on to the next page if the address you were looking for was not found.

Sonicwall offers a product with reasonable content filtering, inline AV, and other badly needed compliance items in a space that is badly served by overselling them on an ASA that will quickly become outdated when the customer decides they overspent and no longer wishes to keep up the maintenance agreement. The majority of PIX/ASA units I saw in the field were 5+ years old and way out of support.    I was Checkpoint Firewall-1 Enterprise Administrator certified back in '98 (on NT/Solaris), and the amount of support hours burned on trying to get simple operations working for small clients was ridiculous.

Other things to consider; will youtube be blocked, reddit (unthinkable), etc.   If the company is established, has a working network at the moment, you really need to monitor the bandwidth used and then plan to around 80% of peak usage (just the way I did it, doesn't make it right).

You need to make sure there's ROOM for this, otherwise you wind up sacrificing your VoIP traffic, but as long as you handle the QoS right on your end and only push essential traffic in that direction (whitelist email traffic and any individually identified essential web apps, etc...) it'll be manageable.

Also with that 100Mbit ""best effort"" connection, what is the average according to the contract - 100, 50, 10, 1 or even 0.1 Mbit/s?  One way could be to get a prioritized 2.5Mbit/s link for your VoIP (given 128Kbps * 15 VoIP-clients at once) and then that ""100Mbit/s best effort"" for your regular pr0nsurfing...  Regarding internal clients abusing your uplinks I think talking to your employees is often a better solution than trying to throw money at the problem (sure for example PaloAltos are great to QoS based on appid but it will be a cat vs mouse game unless you use good design from the beginning - so for example verified email flows will have higher prio than youtube streams)."

networking,3decm2,lathiat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:54:08 2015 UTC,"This is entirely dependant on how oversubscribed the 100MB service is.  You won't really know without trying it.  Forget what others are saying about QoS, what the 60MB service means is that they basically guarantee that 60MB is available to you and won't slow down if every other user on their network is maxing out their connection.  This kind of service is generally most useful to Service Providers or someone expecting to actually use somewhere near their full connection speed on a consistent basis -- as opposed to a casual internet connection where it running a bit slow doesn't matter too much just means your pages load slower but most of the time you'll get most of the speed.  Example: I have a 100Mbit residential service here in Perth, AU.  During the day it's great and I can get 100Mbit (10MB/s) basically full speed [good because I work from home], in the evenings during peak period for all other users [who are likely watching Netflix] it slows right down to the point I am lucky to get 4Mbit (0.4MB/s) and can struggle streaming video.  Here is a graph showing the same download significantly speeding up as it rolls through midnight, this is with 25 streams downloading at the same time: http://lathi.at/files/exetel_speed_overnight.png  So depends how oversubscribed it really is.  With many commercial ISPs it will be perfectly fine, though you also get dreadful residential providers like mine where it is very clearly not.  If this is just for your general Internet usage I would go with the 100MB service unless its proven/known to be dreadfully oversubscribed - mind those contract periods! Also be careful with the IP phones, as they could be affected if the service is truly terrible - though would be expected to work fine on any reasonable service."

networking,3decm2,pentangleit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:10:29 2015 UTC,"With QoS, the critical device is the first bottleneck from the user.  Hence when they go from the 1000BaseT to the desktop down to whatever the leased line value is, the QoS there is going to be the defining factor in what sort of call quality you get.  Given that this will be your router (assuming you're not just giving the entire network over to the ISP to manage) then the QoS would be your responsibility (and tbh that's how you want it to be).  Incidentally, I've managed to run a 16-user call centre (with at least 14 on the phone at once) over a single shared ADSL connection before (due to the company wanting to spend more on call centre agents than it did on IT, but that's another story full of shouting)."
networking,3decm2,Tsiox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd get the 100 mbit, and then put in a traffic shaper to manage it.  If a company is going to sell you a guarenteed 60mbit, that doesn't mean that you wont have problems with it, that just means that they'll guarentee you 60mbit within their network, up to their egress.  If it's 60mbit to the Internet, it's only good to their peering.  If you get 100 mbit, then traffic shape (which can be as easy as putting a traffic shaping statement on your router using fair-queuing), then you pay 1/3rd of the price, you control the latency and jitter for your last-mile, and if the peering is good for your ISP, you get something close to the full 100mbit (95% might be a good number to work with to start).  The main thing is to learn the art of traffic shaping and the magic of bufferbloat/fair-queuing.  If you understand those two things, the 100 mbit connection to a good ISP will be several times better than a ""QOS"" anything-connection."

I can get 100/100 for $50 if I go fiber (equipment in my area is the only factor).  You are way overpaying.  I found that without QoS my upload speed was massively restricted.  I had to set upload bandwidth to manual and give it the max value the router would handle.  Then upload speed shot right up there.

networking,3ddzdz,DrLoveBeats,15,Wed Jul 15 15:04:53 2015 UTC,"The 6.34 Mbit/s is the amount that is actually being transmitted, it is more than your file transfer speed because it includes overhead from the protocol used for sending, and probably encryption. Your file transfer speed is a a bit lower, 5.08Mbit/s, that is correct.  Now the question that remains is why instead of 10Mbit/s the speed dropped to 5.34Mbit/s. This can be due to any of the hardware and software involved. You'll have to troubleshoot each step on the way. For example you can first check if you can even reach the full 10Mbit/s by downloading something from somewhere else (if this is an Internet connection). If the ISP claims to give you 10Mbit/s, but actually gives you 7Mbit/s, then you can stop your troubleshooting already."

If the IPERF fails, take the results and send them to the ISP. Tell the ISP to prove out their circuit with a RFC2544 or something.

Keep in mind, that for Cisco at least, the ""show interface"" throughput is based on a 5 minute average. Also, if you were transferring the file with windows file transfer (CIFS/SMB), the protocol starts to really suck the higher latency that you have.

That is if you would do an iperf, would you then be able to max out the link that is 10Mbps?  Also make sure that no other is transmitting data at the same time as you when you do your benchmarks.  Not uncommon that a provider would sell you lets say a 10Mbps connection but the true speed between these cities or countries is far less.  2) What devices (in terms of firewalls and whatelse) do you have in between the box at site A sending data and the box at site B receiving data?  Normally the tcp-stack will autotune to find out most optimal setting for a particular flow and utilize that, however sometimes the tcp-stack needs to help.  The main problem (except for point 1 above) is often the latency in between the sites. If its lets say 100ms or more between the sites you can help the tcp-stack by tune it a bit so it will use more ram for buffers and by that better be able to utilize the link in between."

The source device is going to stop sending packets until the destination device acknowledges at end of TCP window.    So that means no data moves for 25-50ms (or whatever the site to site RTT latency is), which butchers your overall throughput.    With typical US to anyplace-else international latency in the picture (25 to 50ms typical) you're never going to see 10Mbps SMB throughput over a 10Mbps pipe.    Edited for formatting."

Its not always 100% networking, on average I spend 50% of my time networking 10% on configuring servers and 40% with my feet on the desk watching youtube or doing the CCNP Security if I'm feeling really productive.    Downsides to the job: It's almost too easy.  I'm trying to get them to offer more complex services and maybe send me out more often.  Also I'm not sure if I'd do this for more than a couple of years as the lack of challenge is making my skill set fade and I've been forced to setup a complex lab at work just to try and stay sharp.   I'm probably one of the worst paid people on this subreddit making only £30000, when I was looking for a job most people were offering £35k + but I don't have kids and my wife has a good job so money wasn't the biggest issue, but maybe its not enough for people with families.  Overtime at the end of the month can be a bit of a killer, sometimes 12 hour days but not too often maybe once a month or so.   Even then they never force people to do overtime, its there if you want it, its nice if the order goes out, but if it doesn't, shrug  Unboxing, unpacking, repacking, reboxing 50+ switches is tiresome and not much fun.  Have to do it for every single order.  Upsides: Some nice projects, in the last 5 months I've done stuff for nuclear power plants, airports, London underground, specsavers to name a few.  Not really complex configurations but each is different and you're given quite a lot free reign to go about doing it how you want to do it.  No stress.  Even when people screw up majorly the company has their back.   I guess this changes from place to place but for an easy life style its quite nice.  Travelling, it is there if you want it.

networking,3ddore,itdependsnetworks,25,Wed Jul 15 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on the carrier setup. When roaming on 2G/3G networks, your data path is generally tunnelled from the local carrier's SGSN [Serving GPRS Support Node] via the GRX [GPRS Roaming Exchange] back to the home GGSN [Gateway GPRS Support Node] (where your IP address is assigned - the mobility anchor point) where it is routed out on the public internet.  This is generally preferred by carriers (and basically the only way it can be done in 2/3G due to the original network architecture) as it allows both your home carrier, and the roaming carrier to have charging records (local SGSN can generate CDRs for roaming customers, and remote GGSN for all customers) in the event of a billing dispute.  In LTE, there is the option of local-breakout. In that case the data path exits to the public internet  via the local PGW rather then the home PGW. In theory this would reduce bills (no use of the roaming exchange), and give lower latency connections to the internet for roamers, the problem would be that your home carrier would want/need a way to independently verify the billing.   IPX aims to replace the GRX exchange with a richer set of features, improved QoS, etc. but that is slowly being rolled out at the moment."

Basically, if you're looking at a the console of a router, and decide you want to cycle power to the router, you type a magic key sequence.  Opengear then overlays an ASCII menu of power options on top of your console session. Using this menu, you can have the terminal server cycle power to the router's outlets.  Sure, you can also do this using power strip's built-in UI, or SNMP or whatever, but it's nice to have everything wrapped into one interface so that you're not pouring over spreadsheets trying to find the login credentials and device->outlet mapping for the power strip.

networking,3dgrze,gonnason,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:35:41 2015 UTC,"No DFC's with 100's of HDTV multicasts routing through it is likely what stopped the 6500's.

Device takes a 10g circuit in (of which we likely are only currently using 4g) and routes some to a ubr10k CMTS via 10g, and some up to another 6500-E via 10g at a different site (which then connects via 10g to another ubr10k).  1G circuits would be helpful for a backup LAG that takes a different fiber path to the site, as well as powering a few customers with a direct fiber ethernet handoff (which is shaped at CPE)    This 10g circuit is projected to hold us for ~5 years, the other site has ~3g of WAN as well for failover, which may get upgraded to another 10g circuit in the future, but that sites 6500 has far less video running on it, and has had no issues moving data."

Due to the nature of the project once it is started it has to complete in X amount of time and that time doesn't allow for the extra week.  It's a stupid set of constraints that are forcing this I know it's dumb and I'm trying to make my client understand that the right thing to do is relax the requirements or upgrade the infrastructure to 10Gig.

Beyond transfer speed, don't forget that there's a relatively high chance that a transfer spanning over a month might fail somewhere in the middle. Could have a file read error, network hiccup, power outage.. anything really. Your deadline seems to me to be dependent on everything going absolutely perfectly with no problems at peak performance. Maybe you can work around that kind of thing so you don't have to start over but some people don't have the ability to.  In my experience you can get anywhere from 30MB/s to 100MB/s out of a NAS depending on configuration and other workloads. 100MB/s is at the high end. Also assumes you're moving large data files and not lots of little files. Lots more overhead for those. Any way you can run a short test for a few hours or something?"
networking,3dgjj8,splenetic,2,Thu Jul 16 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"If you were dealing with big files then, yes, you could easily be hitting around 100MBps of usable data transfer with that kind of setup.   But the problem you've got is that, unless my maths is completely broken (which is possible) that's only about 90KB per file in the DB. File creation overhead is going to be the absolute killer here although that's very OS / file system / transfer protocol dependent. What's the NAS?"
networking,3dgjj8,d00bianista,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  Yes the files are ~90KB in size.  The NAS sits on top of a seriously ridiculous Enterprise SAN, creating the files, updating inode tables with metadata, etc is not going to be bottlenecking this process.  It will be the 1GigE connection.  It's being written over NFS, I'm not sure what the protocol overhead of NFS is."
networking,3dgjj8,Apachez,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"~82Mbytes per file, ~1s transfer time per file... Worst case scenario might be that it takes almost as long for both creating the new file on the NAS and transferring the contents. This of course depends on the NAS performance and might not be an issue.  I believe this aspect to be why most estimations are way off. Moving loads of small files is no fun."
networking,3dgjak,aaksut79,3,Thu Jul 16 02:26:55 2015 UTC,"IMO you want to make your cell sizes as small as possible to enable better roaming. A lot of devices tend not to switch APs until the signal gets below a certain threshold, so you could have devices staying bound to a certain AP when there's a better one closer. Also makes it harder to plan for capacity since larger cells means more potential clients and less predictability where they connect to.  It's also just kind of a nice thing to do... if you don't need the power cranked for your use case then turn it down. It is a shared medium after all."

It's surprising just how far you can get with shell-scripting alone, before needing a more full-featured language.

Configuring OSPF on a layer-3 switch is really no different from a router - you still have your layer-3 IP interfaces, they're just the Vlan interface instead of the physical gigabit/fastethernet you'd use on a router.  So if you had a router with something like:  int gig0/1 ip address 10.1.10.1 255.255.255.0 ! router ospf 10 network 10.1.10.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 blah blah !   On a layer-3 switch the equivalent might look like:  int vlan 100 ip address 10.1.10.1 255.255.255.0 ! router ospf 10 network 10.1.10.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 blah blah !"

networking,3ddvoy,OUScotty,8,Wed Jul 15 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"Most likely recursive routing, you are learning the tunnel end-point addresses through the tunnel which confuses the router as to how to establish the GRE tunnel.  Are the end-points being advertised through the tunnel interface aka the same EIGRP process?  If you check 'show ip route' and see the tunnel end-points are learned via Tu0 then that's the issue.  Are you using a front-door VRF to access the tunnel endpoint?  Otherwise, you'll need to statically route to the end-point via your WAN interface so administrative distance of a static wins in the RIB.  3 ways to mitigate recursive routing in order of best practice priority:  1) Use a front-door VRF on the WAN side to default out and find the tunnel endpoint.  Your unencrypted IKE traffic is in 'VRF internet' and then the tunnel itself is in the global routing table.  Therefore the routing tables don't clash.  2) Use static routes to point to the tunnel endpoints.  Therefore, if you are advertising them back through the tunnel via EIGRP, the administrative distance of static (1) beats EIGRP (90).  3) Block the tunnel end-points from being advertised through EIGRP with a route-map.  This is if the first two options aren't available.  Use a prefix list to identify the tunnel endpoint subnet and then add that to a deny route map.  Finally, use a 'distribute-list route-map XXXX' under the EIGRP process."
networking,3ddvoy,bobivy1234,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"During my googlefu yesterday that was one of the most common things that came up but in all the instances the error shown in the logs or on the console screen was always a recursive routing issue but I suspect even though that isn't popping up you may be correct.  On the crypto maps for the IPSEC tunnel I am only allowing the loopback addresses across on both sides.  The only route I currently have is (branch site)     ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 70.182.xxx.xxx  interface loopback0     ip address 10.40.0.82 255.255.255.255   Obviously the tunnel interfaces are part of the same subnet. WAN side is listed above as 10.40.0.98/28 and the Tunnel0 on the HQ switch is 10.40.0.97/28.  Branch side:    sh ip route 10.40.0.97     Routing entry for 10.40.0.96/28     Known via ""connected"", distance 0, metric 0 (connected, via   interface)     Redistributing via eigrp 100     Routing Descriptor Blocks:     * directly connected, via Tunnel0     Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1   So if I'm to set a static route, do I set a static route for the IP address that is on the tunnel out the WAN interface?  Would I have to allow that in the crypto tunnel?  I figured that would have been covered with the source and destination of the tunnel utilizing the loopback addresses so all traffic flows through those.  Or are you referring to a static route for the loopback addresses on both ends?  Diagram I just added:  http://i.imgur.com/9DExQGL.png  Appreciate your response greatly."
networking,3ddvoy,bobivy1234,2,Wed Jul 15 15:20:03 2015 UTC,"There's two parts to focus on here, one is the underlay L3 access to each end-point and then the overlay GRE with routing and IPsec.  If possible, remove the IPsec and just focus on the underlay routing and then GRE and overlay.  How do you know about the destination loopback end-point private address today over the WAN?  You'd set a static route to the end-point loopback address as this is  how the GRE communication is being established.  The route to this end-point has to be rock-solid, if you check 'show ip route' for the destination loopback now and its learned via EIGRP, then that's the problem.  Most times, the tunnel destination IP is a publicly accessible IP because how would you advertise the private loopback into the internet other than NAT?  Resiliency isn't a problem since its one connection anyway unless its DHCP.    Can you utilize the public 'int e0/0 outside' address and the router 'int fa0/0' address for the tunnel endpoints?  That would solve most of your issues and then route over those with your private networks, that's what most folks do.  Since it's an ASA and doesn't support GRE, you could use an internally-housed loopback but it would have to be publicly addressed or NAT'd to an address that is accessible from the outside world with the ASA allowing GRE and then isakmp and esp."
networking,3ddvoy,chuckbales,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:54:53 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the response.    Currently the loopbacks on both sides are able to talk to each other without having to do NAT and/or publicly accessible IP because of the IPSEC tunnel.  On the branch side the IPSEC tunnel and the crypto map enabling the branch loopback to talk to the loopback on the HQ side is on the same box, so I didn't need a static route to tell the branch_loopback where to go to look for the HQ_loopback.  It just knows it needs to go down the IPSEC tunnel.     Because at HQ we have an ASA, I did have to do a static route on the 6500 switch/router for the branch_loopback pointing to the inside interface of the ASA.  It then hits the ASA crypto map and sees that it needs to go down the IPSEC tunnel to get to the branc side.    I completely agree based upon what I'm seeing that it seems to be a recurisve route issue because as soon as I enable EIGRP the tunnel starts bouncing up and down.  It is stable if I don't do EIGRP so that tells me that's most likely the issue.  The problem is I am kind of stumped on where I need to point the tunnels as my design seems 'ok', I just can't find the design flaw."
networking,3ddvoy,mathech,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"What does your EIGRP config and static routes look like? Your cryptomap should stay as just between the GRE tunnel endpoints (loopbacks).  If you're redistributing connected or otherwise advertising out the loopback, the routers can end up in a cycle of building the GRE tunnel, establishing EIGRP, then learning that they need to reach the far loopback through the tunnel (instead of through their local firewall), which then breaks the GRE/EIGRP. A static route to the far sides loopback to the VPN firewall would prevent an EIGRP-learned route from getting added to the routing table (due to admin distance). Though I typically go with the static route in addition to filtering what routes are advertised out (preventing loopback IP from being advertised)."

The HQ side also has an entry for the 10.40.0.96 network.  It has a static route to tell the network where to go for the Branch side loopback address.  In this case it sends the 10.40.0.82 statically to the inside interface of the ASA and then of course the ASA has that address in it's crypto map to send it down the tunnel to it's peer.  Because the router at the branch is doing the IPSEC, the crypto map is directly on the router therefore I didn't see a need for a static route to the loopback back at HQ."

The stack must be set to 9000 at a global/L2 level, this should be ""system mtu jumbo 9000"", and a reboot of the stack (all switches) is required after.  This enables a L2 frame size of 9000 on all ports, the reboot is required because the hardware ASICs get set up slightly differently on boot.  If you have Layer3 (routed) interfaces in vlans, you only need to change the MTU on the VLAN if you want to route packets larger than 1500, note that this also requires ""system mtu jumbo 9000""  tl;dr: If the storage traffic is all staying Layer2 (no routing) ""system mtu jumbo 9000"" is all you need."

networking,3dbiy7,letstrythisagain_,23,Wed Jul 15 00:06:40 2015 UTC,"For something like this, I'd suggest deciding between three general options:   Determine an hourly rate that is acceptable to you and quote that.  Make sure this is high enough to be worthwhile in the sense that you're going to deprioritize and not give this job your full attention if they're underpaying you.  Set up the contract so that they are obligated to pay you the full amount for the time actually worked if the time differs from the quote. Similar to the above, determine an hourly rate and then quote that as a flat fee, and don't alter the amount owed for any difference in actual time vs. quoted time. Determine a flat fee that you want for the job regardless of time worked / hourly rate / etc.  Client owes this and nothing more/less as long as the scope of work is constrained to the agreement signed.   In terms of exact amounts to charge, you'd have to use your personal judgement and research local rates.  People on here will throw around all sorts of numbers -- I've seen $50/hour and $250/hour.  Keep in mind the blue-collar adage where a technician is called to fix a broken system, makes one small adjustment, and then charges a large sum of money (knowledge and experience with short time of completion and high quality work are worth the same / more than a longer job with lower skill/quality).  Nonprofit volunteer work is great, too -- don't let anybody tell you otherwise.  However, keep a close eye on how much time you give away vs. charge for and make sure that time you give away for free is time spent doing something you enjoy.  Also, nonprofits are legitimate clients as well -- you may need to offer discounts to be sensitive to their budgets in some cases, but they are willing to pay for services in the right context.  Sometimes you may have to help coach them on building their business to incorporate budgeting for IT-related expenses as a core business asset rather than as an as-needed/emergency basis (aka not including any money for them).  Changes to their behavior in this regard may take time (i.e. waiting to be incorporated in the upcoming annual budget cycle), but when done successfully this type of coaching can be very positive and set the nonprofit up to be more stable and sustainable in the future.

I still keep track of hours, but when your new to this it's easier to estimate what something should cost then how long it will take you to do it. This sounds like a $200-$400 dollar job, I'm guessing toward the $200 if it turns out to be as simple as it sounds.   If your going to be doing this for a living they say to charge 2x or 3x what you would pay some one to do it hourly. So you should bill about $45-60 an hour.

You should do this once you have terminated and labeled all the cables in the patch panel. As they are old cables, this is the way you can be sure everything is perfect. This is to avoid you having any weird connection issues happen later (you will get the blame).  And also the customer gets a big document with nice professional looking charts showing that all the cabling is perfect.    It can also help you spot any issues with poorly routed cabling, such as long runs in parallel with high voltage power lines. I have seen this cause chaos for 1 office's sales team Cisco phones that I have worked at. You want to avoid that at all costs because when sales guys continuously have their phones disconnect from the server and drop calls, the pressure gets very high."

Overall, the CCSA test is heavily geared towards specific NAT functions, the Identity Awareness blade, and GUI options from what I remember. The training will prove very helpful in that regard.  With all that being said, you can take the install ISOs and spin up a VM and use the 30 day trial window for training purposes. Combine that with the real world install you now see, and perhaps something like CBT Nuggets R76 videos (R76 and R77 GUIs and CCSA exams are VERY similar), and you'll have no problems. If you really hunt down study material, it's out there. Just know to look for both R76 and R77. Good luck!"

networking,3dfnou,Ziricom_Networks,2,Wed Jul 15 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"When you have cloudflare protect a domain (or sub domain) it does so by acting as a proxy to your web server. So instead of the DNS record returning your servers IP address, it returns theirs. This is of course problematic if your DNS record for your web server and VPN is the same. You will need to have a separate DNS record for the VPN server for this to work. So create the sub domain vpn.mydoamin.com and click the cloud icon so it bypasses cloudflare and returns the actual A record for this subdomin (the real IP address of your server)."

networking,3dfnou,andrewimeson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:55:10 2015 UTC,Another problem with such setup is that using Cloudflare is also to hide the true IP-address from the ones who performs the DDoS.  If you now have vpn.example.com then they can figure out where your internetlink lives anyway and start to DDoS the ip of vpn.example.com which gives that your internet connection goes down anyway even if you are using Cloudflare.  So in this case the best would be to:  1) Enable Cloudflare.  2) Disable vpn.example.com (and other subdomains pointing to your internet connection).  3) Change IP-addresses (talk to your ISP).  4) Update Cloudflare (so it points to your new ip's).  5) Update vpn-configuration so it connects to a IP-address instead of a FQDN (vpn.example.com or whatever you were using).
networking,3dfnou,andrewimeson,2,Thu Jul 16 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"CloudFlare's DDoS protection is only offered for HTTP and HTTPS, no other protocols can be proxied through a CloudFlare protected record (note I said record and not domain  CloudFlare's protection is can be enabled/disabled on the root of your domain (example.com), as well as any or all subdomains (www.example.com and blog.example.com can be set to be protected, but you leave vpn.example.com unprotected because it's not a web service)  An important thing to understand about how CloudFlare works is that when you enable their protection on a record (can be an 'A' record or CNAME), the DNS response for that record no longer will return the IP address of the system you're hosting the ""content"" on, it will return CloudFlare IP addresses, so the user's traffic hits CloudFlare web servers, and is then proxied back to your origin server.  What should you do? You should give CloudFlare a spin, but keep in my mind that there are some DDoS scenarios that they cannot prevent (more on that later). You should turn on the CloudFlare protection for whatever domains and subdomains you're hosting web content from, and create subdomains that aren't CloudFlare-protected for any services, like a VPN that won't work through the CloudFlare reverse proxy.  Note that if there is an intentional DDoS against you, and they already know the origin server's IP address, obfuscating the domain through CloudFlare can't save you unless it's an application-layer issue, and not a bandwidth issue. If it's an application layer issue, deny all web traffic from any IP address that doesn't belong to CloudFlare, and that will prevent them from bypassing the protection.  If it's a bandwidth issue, go ahead and put CloudFlare in place, but you're going to want to work with your ISP to blackhole the offending traffic upstream.  I am a big CloudFlare fan, and have seen it do wonders for site performance. They've got some really smart people working for them who have designed a great system.  EDIT: Also, regarding redirects, you need to to add an HTTP virtualhost in whatever webserver you're using for the subdomains you want to redirect, create an 'A' record that points to the webserver (and protect it behind CloudFlare) and have it redirect traffic to your desired destination. That's all namecheap was doing in the background, there's no DNS-only method for redirecting HTTP(s) pages."

networking,3da5e0,D4rkSh4dow,15,Tue Jul 14 18:14:33 2015 UTC,"As the title says. Once I can afford 10Gbe am I better off with fiber optic or copper cables.   There's copper, and there's copper.    There's 10GbaseT, which uses CAT6E/6A/7 twisted pair and RJ45 connectors.  While this standard does exist, and you can find switches/NICs that use it, they're a lot less common - you almost have to decide up front to dedicate your network to the underdog, which is a bit dangerous.  The distance limitation on this is, depending on your cabling, up to 100m.  Trying to actually use it to such distances seems to be a frowned-upon endeavor.   In fact, using it at all is somewhat frowned upon, because the design of CAT6/7 does not lend itself to 10gbit speeds with much headroom, and there are a lot of ways in which relatively small problems (which would not be an issue with gigabit) can make your life hard with 10gbit.  Then, there's direct-attach, SFP+, twinax stuff.   Because SFP+ is the most common type of switch port, this lets you use switches that are not only easier to source and more varied in availability, but those switches can also use fiber (via SFP+ modules) if you want to in the future.  SFP+ direct-attach twinaxial is relatively cheap as well.  The downside is the distance limitation, max according to spec is 30m.  In reality, trying to use it at the long end of that spec seems also to be frowned upon.    SFP+ DAC may have lower latency than 10Gbase-T stuff.  However, even with the ""high latency"" 10Gbase-T, we're still talking microsecond range, not millisecond, and for what you describe, that should be completely inconsequential.  There are other types of direct-attach copper, but they're probably not for you.  (Unless you're doing something like deciding to run 10gbe instead of Infiniband over that old Mellanox switch with CX connectors....)  Personally, if I'm going from a device to a top-of-rack switch, sure, I'll happily use DAC SFP+ twinax cables.  We're talking up to 8' lengths, it works just fine.  Shoot, I might even run it to the next rack in the row, if we're talking 10'-15' and the fate of the world isn't resting upon that connection.  But if you're doing longer than that, you really should be going fiber.  So, after that long-winded rant, here's the short version:  Get SFP+ switches and NICs, use DAC copper for short intra-rack runs, fiber for anything longer."
networking,3da5e0,MinimusNadir,25,Tue Jul 14 20:51:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the application and what you mean by copper!  For datacenter use, 10GbaseT over Cat6 doesn't make sense, the switchports and NICs are much more expensive than SFP+  With SFP+ you can obviously run fibre modules and cables but if the distance is short enough then you're better with direct attached cables (Twinax) which are cables with sfp+ plugs on the ends. These are normally copper based but you can get optical assemblies for longer distances"

The difference is between the core diameters, single mode is thin and has only one path/mode the light can conceivably take, while multimode has a wider core (see: is cheaper to make) but over a distance the light can end up taking different paths and interfering with itself.  Single mode should support 10Gbps over multiple kilometers without too much trouble.  Most singlemode fiber is G.652 fiber (non-dispersion-shifted fiber), which should support 10Gbps over short reaches with no problem.  Just be sure to watch your Tx power versus your Rx sensitivity.  Multimode is increasingly supporting higher bandwidth applications over short distances.  If you get OM3 or OM4 multimode, it should support 10 Gbps up to several hundred meters.  Because the fiber is only capable of such short ranges, your Tx/Rx sensitivies shouldn't be as big of an issue.  Make sure you match your SFPs to your fiber type.  It's not enough to match up the connector (LC-UPC is probably the way you want to go), you have to make sure you get SFPs specifically for single mode or for multimode depending on which fiber type you chose to go with.  You can lose huge amounts of light trying to go from a single mode SFP to a multimode SFP and vice versa."

DAC cables are premade cables with the tranceivers built into them but are only good for about 10 meters.

The biggest problem I see with people using fiber is they don't scope and clean the ends before connecting and they have no idea how easy it is to get an end dirty.

The problem with SFP+ is if you want to attach a bunch of devices (and even if you dont plan on it, eventually you will) you need a 10Gb switch, which runs about $4,999 or so. You can find Infiniband switches sometimes for as low as $100 dollars."

I think it's a little more acceptable for enterprise products to have complicated configuration, because the measure of their success has a lot more to do with reliability, security end-user (non-IT) ease of use, and other requirements that aren't administrative accessibility.  Linux, for example, is generally a stupid idea to put on a technophobe's computer (at least without someone being available to administrate and manage it for them), but Linux is often a great platform in the enterprise.

networking,3ddsoh,badalchemist,3,Wed Jul 15 17:02:13 2015 UTC,"So this is really a blending of two issues - VPN access, and posture assessment.  Now the first part, VPN access, is really pretty dead simple.  Authenticate the user, bring up an SSL or IPSEC tunnel, tweak some routes, and you're good!  This is all we really use our Juniper VPN for, and client compatibility issues aside, it's been pretty rock solid.  The other half, posture assessment, is much harder.  Part of this is a technical issue (you have to know how to scan lots of different OS variants, check the patch levels on all of the virus scanners, etc), but IMHO the much harder part is getting your policy exactly right.  You have to consider all of the OS versions, acceptable virus scanners, security policies, and so forth.  The more you specify, the more you end up having lots of edge cases that you didn't consider.  If you don't have all of your configurations tightly managed in close coordination with the posture assessment setup, it can easily create a nightmare (ie, security says AV data files must be no older than 24 hours, but desktop support configures AV to only check every 72 hours.  Oops!)  In short, I think it's a really difficult problem, and any company should think long and hard before going too far down the posture assessment road, especially if they don't have ""bet your life"" level confidence in the current state of their endpoints.  On the brighter side, keep in mind that Juniper has spun their VPN product into a totally separate company, Pulse Secure.  This is good for the long run prospects in that instead of being a small scale afterthought inside Juniper, the Pulse product is the only thing this entire company will focus on.  I don't know if they'll be able to produce some magic bullet to make the problem easier, but at a minimum they should be able to further polish and refine the tooling better."

The central point is where the 1900 router will be located and it will be broadcasting out audio to each of the 9 surrounding networks. All these networks are separated over large distances; up to about 900KM at the farthest end, so the equipment has to be built to last. For that central point, it will be sending audio to all 9 network locations constantly and will need to be able to receive audio from all 9 locations, but will only be accessing one location at a time. We are using Barix streamers to accomplish the task of streaming.   The uptime is important, these routers are going to be running audio streams 24/7. For those remote networks, they have less of a bandwidth requirement, as they only need to send 1 feed and receive one feed (using about 2Mbps).

If you need to get between different vlans you'll need something to route the traffic at layer 3, such as a router."
networking,3db1b8,skyrim56,5,Tue Jul 14 21:53:29 2015 UTC,"If you can route, route with L3 interfaces.  Only reason to keep these L2 with SVI is if you need to trunk across a VLAN from one end to the other.  There's no problem with doing L2 but L3 is preferred, doesn't run an extra STP instance and port status is based on the physical connection rather than the underlying VLAN interface members.  /30 is fine for static P2P links, just dedicate a /24 for point-to-points to split them off and don't worry about it, we use /30's all the time.  /31's are ideal to save two IP's but if you're using 10.X.X.X space, you have more than enough room to use /30's and won't potentially hit anything odd with /31's with inter-operability or routing (not saying I have)."
networking,3db1b8,bobivy1234,2,Tue Jul 14 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"On a Cisco it's essentially the same thing - the switch allocates an internal VLAN from your pool of [1006 - 4094], either up or down depending on the ""vlan internal allocation policy"", when you configure a 'no switchport'.

Routed ports reduce CPU processing by not needing STP or DTP as well as no STP convergence delays on port flaps as well as not extending the L2 domain between devices.  May be mistaken on ECMP and haven't confirmed that.  https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/10149211/svi-vs-routed-port  A routed 'no switchport' differs from a switchport + SVI in that the routed port doesn't have to run an STP instance or DTP/VTP.

For L2 environments you're asking for trouble without STP, which is why we're talking about L3 routed ports in switches that disable it automatically on internal VLAN interfaces.  I'd never turn off STP manually anywhere, maybe BPDUfilter when patching sites but never turning off STP and there is a difference there.  Unless you're routing at the access layer and don't need any L2 extensions anywhere or DCI, then STP is always necessary for L2 loop prevention in typical networks.  I'm definitely in the camp to eliminate STP blocked ports wherever I can with etherchannel, vPC, and VSS but it depends on the environment and requirements."
networking,3db1b8,bobivy1234,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"While I think this is good advice, we use p2p L2 extended VLANs for all routing. Occasionally you need to span a vlan or implement VRF-lite for another routing instance, and sticking with L2 makes future implementations trivial. Just something to keep in mind if you are going to be doing VRFs or ever have the need to span vlans.  Note that if you are going to use L2 vlans, make sure they only exist on the individual routed interfaces in a p2p fashion so you get fast failover when the link drops. If the vlan is trunked on any other interfaces, you will be relying on OSPF timers for failover, which is not good practice."

networking,3db1b8,kidn3ys,3,Tue Jul 14 22:08:07 2015 UTC,I would say it depends on the p2p use case. Is it internal to your routing domain where you control both sides? Then /31 all day.   Is it a handoff to a customer? Do you need to justify some address space to ARIN? Then a /30 or /29 seems to be the norm.   Personally a lot of my customers have ASAs at their edge and they don't support /31s. Interop has typically been the response when I ask why a /30 was allocated instead of a /31.

networking,3db1b8,Apachez,0,Mon Jul 20 09:16:08 2015 UTC,If you use tagged (trunk) or non-tagged (access) is a matter of taste.  The good thing when using tagged is that you will somewhat avoid clusterfucks in case you patch the wrong cable into the wrong interface (because properly setup tagging will drop unwanted tags which gives that nothing happens if you connected the wrong cable to the wrong interface - compared to worst case scenario with a L2 or L3 loop that forms and downgrades your network).  Other than that using /29 (instead of /30) might be advisable to have room the day you decide that this particular link needs redundant gear and you start to use VRRP/HSRP.  That is for example an addressing such as the following might be sane:  Assuming 10.0.0.0/29 for the link where:  .1 = nexthop downlink  .2 = physical box1 downlink  .3 = physical box2 downlink  .4 = physical box2 uplink  .5 = physical box1 uplink  .6 = nexthop uplink  This way even if you currently only got 1 box on each end then the downlink box will get .1 and the uplink box gets .6. That is the routing will become:  Downlink routing:  x.x.x.x/x nexthop y.y.y.1  Uplink routing:  0.0.0.0/0 nexthop y.y.y.6  Other than that various IXes often have good examples on what you should and shouldnt do on your L3 links:  https://ams-ix.net/technical/specifications-descriptions/config-guide  http://www.netnod.se/router-configuration-examples  http://www.sthix.net/support.php
networking,3db1b8,IWillNotBeBroken,2,Tue Jul 14 22:13:01 2015 UTC,"I think everyone else is keeping ""this is a p2p link"" sacrosanct, whereas you're simply saying ""it's a L3 subnet which currently has two assigned IPs; leave room in case you want/need to run HSRP/VRRP on that link.""  Although I'm curious with the /29 subnet -- what's the point of HSRP/VRRP there?  You can't fit any downstream (of box1 and box2) hosts within the /29, so you're routing anyways -- why not just put box{1,2}'s uplinks (whether they're individual p2p links, or on a shared segment) into the IGP (and either IGP or BGP for the y.y.y.0/24 subnet as well)?  (despite the diagram, I'm assuming y.y.y.0/24 is a L2 segment that both box{1,2} are on)  upstream box .6 --(/29)-- .2 box1 .254 -- y.y.y.0/24                      \--- .3 box2 .253 -- y.y.y.0/24   Personally, I'd rather have the IGP decide which box the upstream one chooses to reach y.y.y.0/24 (rather than statically pointing at the shared VRRP IP).  Running VRRP on y.y.y.0/24 makes sense if you have to statically configure things within that subnet, but the IGP takes care of reachability to the upstream box (and beyond) -- also if you later add other upstreams to box{1,2}, things tend to just work, rather than having to redo the static routes.  I'm very much a Layer-3 person; do you, by chance, work mostly in Layer 2?  That might explain our differing preferences on how to handle the router redundancy of box{1,2}."
networking,3db1b8,Apachez,0,Wed Jul 15 02:56:46 2015 UTC,"You are routing from point A (physical ip .2 and .3, virtual ip .1) to point B (physical ip .4 and .5, virtual ip .6) that is between the virtual ip's (if you do a tcpdump on that segment between point A and B you will only see traffic originating the mac-addresses of the virtual ip's or depending on implementation the physical mac-address who currently holds the virtual ip on each side).  I work in the full segment of L1 to L7 (along with the stupidity that happens at L8 and beyond :-)  The ""allocate a /29 and use /29, /30 or if both sides supports it /31"" is just as with IPv6 ""allocate /64 and use /126 or /127 or whatever you like"". There are even those who allocate /24 (in the IPv4 world) for each link but I think thats a bit of a waste (also because I prefer to use one set of ip-range for infrastructure (links) and another set(s) for servers and clients).  Its not a uncommon thing to have a handoff using VRRP/HSRP when you for example do geodiversity towards an ISP.  But if you are happy with using a /31 then go ahead :-)"

The other 3-4 VLAN's in the L3 switch each need a default-gateway configured in the switch.    Usually the .1, or first useable address in the subnet.    The clients and servers need to be told to use this address as their default-gateway.    You either update the DHCP Scope, or login to each static-IP device and tell it about the new gateway address.    Then you tell the L3 switch that its default-route is the SonicWall. Then you feed the SonicWall a route statement for each of your VLANs/Subnets pointing back to the L3 switch.    Done."

networking,3daler,bobivy1234,2,Wed Jul 15 13:01:38 2015 UTC,"Ideally you would do inter-vlan switching on the L3 switch with a single default gateway to the Sonicwall.  L3 switches have hardware ASIC's for very fast L3 routing, let the Sonicwall only handle unknown unicast packets.  Currently you have a 'router-on-a-stick' configuration which is inefficient from a packet-flow standpoint.  For VA_Network_Nerd's comment, that is correct in that you would need to add ACL's on the L3 switch that may be present on the SonicWall to restrict access between different VLANs.  If there is no restrictions required between internal users and the servers, then just add the SVI's to the L3 switch and update the end-device gateway IP's to the SVI's.  Build a /30 routed network between the L3 switch and Sonicwall as the default gateway."

I was actually considering doing this when I can schedule some downtime for the maintenance.  My real question is not so much the best way to setup my network, but rather if it is possible to do it as I described above.  The cause of this question is in consulting with our MSP, they seem to think IVR on the L3 Switch can happen with the default gateway being the SonicWall.  I honestly don't know, but I don't think that makes sense...  and the routes he created on the L3 switch point to ghost ip addresses.  I just want to know if its possible in any way without changing the default-gateway from the sonicwall.  Thanks again!"
networking,3daler,shadycuz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, what you described in your OP isn't possible then or you're misunderstanding the default gateway concept.  A device can only have one default gateway and that L3 IP interface and device has to break down the L2 header where the 802.1Q tag is and re-write it for the other VLAN for inter-VLAN traffic.  Think of the packet-flow from an end-device to wherever its going and follow the path.  There are multiple 'default gateways' at play at different points in the network.  If the gateway is configured as the Sonicwall IP, then the packet has to go to the and the Sonicwall will do the routing.  From an ARP standpoint, it has to follow that logic.  How would the switch in the middle know without the L3 interfaces in its routing table?  The network default gateway should be the Sonicwall, but only from the L3 switch's point-of-view.  All the other 'default gateways' for each VLAN will be on the L3 switch as SVI's.  Therefore a user trying to get to google.com will say 'I don't know this IP and its outside my local network, send to the default gateway' which is the L3 switch SVI.  The L3 switch will look in its routing table and say 'I don't know this IP, send to my default gateway' which is the SonicWall.  Sonicwall will NAT and send the packet into the internet towards google.com.  See that the two default gateways are different for different devices.  End-User -> VLAN Default Gateway IP (SVI) on L3 Switch -> Default Gateway on /30 routed or VLAN subnet -> Internet (NAT)"

networking,3daler,bobivy1234,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"as others have said this is possible, I did pretty much exactly the same thing at my company a couple of years ago.  They had a juniper FW with sub IFs for each VLAN and were using the FW to route traffic between those VLANs (connected to a 100mbps port.... arghh).  We still wanted the router on a stick configuration so added two 3925 routers with HSRP and created sub IFs on these to be the default gateways of the VLANs.   You will have to remove the default gateways from the Sonicwall and add them into VLAN interfaces on the switch, creating new interface IPs on the sonicwall in the same subnet for each VLAN."
networking,3daler,r08zy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:38:52 2015 UTC,"Any reason you picked 3925 routers for that instead of 3850's or similar L3 switches with purpose-built switching ASIC's?  The throughput on the 3925 for inter-vlan routing is small compared to the L3 switches and then both can default northbound to the SonicWall.  Also, not understanding putting Sonicwall IP's for each VLAN at that point.  What is the use there as the 3925 interfaces would act as gateways and process inter-VLAN traffic?  If the 3925's then defaulted to the Sonicwall IP over the same VLAN/subnet, then that's generating IP redirects and process-switching too many packets (in one interface/out the same interface)  Ideally, the L3 switches have the SVI's with HSRP and then default northbound to the Sonicwall in a separate routed VLAN.  Therefore all the switching/routing can be done in hardware."

In that design, you'd just want one IP on the switch for remote access, in your management vlan.   According to HP's website the 2620 does ""Basic Layer 3 services"" thankfully, because layer 3 capabilities is what you need.   The interfaces that you put on the router? 10.10.10.1, 10.10.20.1, etc.? You're gonna wanna put those on the Management switch as you called it so that it will function as the default gateway for all end users on the LAN. Then you'll need a default route on the Management Switch pointing to the router for internet access. It sounds like the 2620 doesn't have a DHCP server so you need a Windows or Linux box to serve as your DHCP server. Put this DHCP server in the same VLAN as the SVI on your switches and the management interface of your router, along with any other network/server devices. This way, you have a management VLAN that is separate from user traffic."

That way they don't need to understand subnets or routers at all; effectively they always assume that they're on a /0 network.  Of course this trick only works if the device only ever responds to inbound connections. So this works for the door controllers as they just get polled by the central server to collect access logs and to push out new configs.

Both. The WAN interface doesn't present any challenge. It's the tunnel IP (or, more specifically the NHRP NHS) that's the challenge.   Do you have a single or multi-cloud MDVPN setup?   I'm not familiar with the term. I have several DMVPN hubs. Each one is a single router that does mGRE/NHRP/IPSec. These routers do not share an NHRP segment. They don't know about one another."
networking,3dalon,cantstop_wontstop,2,Tue Jul 14 23:25:33 2015 UTC,Two options:  1) Combine the DMVPN hubs into a single DMVPN cloud.  Each hub will be listed as a NHS.  The tunnel addressing on all of the hubs and spokes will be in the same subnet.   2) Build a DMVPN tunnel per-hub on the spokes.  FYI - ASR1000 do not support spoke tunnel IP assignment via DHCP.

networking,3dalon,SangriaParaTodos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:33:25 2015 UTC,"Combine the DMVPN hubs into a single DMVPN cloud.   This one's not an option. The spokes will be roaming among different IP transport networks. Connectivity between the environments is unpredictable.   Build a DMVPN tunnel per-hub on the spokes.   This is what I've always done. Until now, the worst case scenario was 4 transport networks, so each spoke had three tunnels up/down and one tunnel up/up. The one tunnel that worked is the one that was reachable at the time.  Now the environment is getting more... interesting? The problem is scaling up. It's a lot of stuff to keep track of. DHCP would be so nice.  Here's my understanding of the problem: NHS must be ""in the tunnel"", and on that IP subnet, so the spoke can't be completely ignorant about where he's connecting. Is that about right?  There's an FQDN option to the 'ip nhrp nhs' command, but I can't figure out how to leverage that to my advantage.  A couple of other options have occurred to me:   Rather than run lots of tunnel interfaces (all but one of which would fail to connect), run a single tunnel interface, but list all of the NHSes in that tunnel configuration. All but one NHS would be down in this scenario. Just run the same IP subnet in each tunnel, and keep this block of addresses out of my IGP. Each DMVPN cloud will have its NHS at the same IP.    ASR1000 do not support spoke tunnel IP assignment via DHCP   It seems like I'd stumbled on this limitation before, but I couldn't find it last I looked. Is this problem when using ASR1K as hub, as spoke, or both ways?"

networking,3dalon,SangriaParaTodos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"Would you mind elaborating on the ""bad time"" you mentioned?  The main tricky requirement in my environment is that I have lots of IPv4 multicast (sources and subscribers are at each spoke), and the VPN traverses transport networks that don't support multicast.  I have no requirement for spoke-to-spoke connectivity (actually, I need to avoid it)."
networking,3dalon,cantstop_wontstop,2,Wed Jul 15 14:58:30 2015 UTC,Maybe then it's me who didn't get the requirements right.   I was alluding to the problem you seem to be trying to work around which is related to NHRP registration and addressing. Flex doesn't do registration.   But maybe then it's a whole different beast if you're talking about mcast.   Let's first what the real problem you're trying to solve it. Some diagram maybe?
networking,3dalon,cantstop_wontstop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"FlexVPN may well be the best solution for me, I just don't know anything about it. I'm a little wary about how PIM works between unnumbered tunnel interfaces. Maybe fine? I need to look into it.  Short version:  I have a bunch of VPN hubs at fixed locations. Some are on the Internet, some are on private networks. They're interconnected among themselves when that's possible. It's not always possible.  Each VPN hub has the same IP assigned to a loopback interface. Let's say it's 1.1.1.1.  Spoke routers find their way onto one of these public or private transport networks, and attempt to dial home to 1.1.1.1.  Behind the spoke routers are end devices which send/receive IP multicast.  Scenarios I have to support:   A single spoke router. No hubs available. A spoke (or several) attached to the nearest hub. Several spokes attached to different hubs with full reachability among all spokes.   Because I don't know in advance which hub will be nearest, it'd be handy for the configuration of the spoke's tunnel interface to be subnet-agnostic.  That's what I'm trying to solve: strip all evidence of the tunnel subnet from the configuration of the tunnel interface on the spoke routers."

Maybe it is a timing issue where the vlan is not getting assigned quickly enough.  Could you go into more detail about the design and what states the client moves through?"
networking,3d92c6,hi11111,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:51:10 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. I should mention this is all based on a windows 7 client. When the computer first powers on it gets thrown into a vlan by authenticating with my windows NPS server. The NPS server sees that the computer is a domain computer and gets put into a ""walled garden"" where it really can only access internal services for AD auth, DHCP, and updates(Note: this is the last policy so user NPS policies are applied first). I did remove the walled garden for testing purposes the same issues still occurred. Then depending on which type of user logs into the computer it uses their credentials to sign into to the wifi. When I watch the handshake go through I see that the attribute I return is correct and it does go into the proper vlan but, that is where I'm seeing it try to request the same address in the logs of my client probe i just see 5x DHCP requests then it settles with the address it was already assigned. But, since it's no longer in that vlan when the client logs on it doesn't go anywhere because it's in a different vlan and obviously can't hit the gateway of the address it thinks it should have. So if i do a release renew it picks the right address and off i go but, if i log out same thing happens and it doesn't get put back into the right vlan again. Like i said in my original post this is all working flawlessly on my cisco gear using very similar configs. I know someone who has this working 100% on his juniper gear but it's older and his gear allows him to use forwarding-options helpers instead of forwarding-options dhcp-relay mine doesn't and so far that's the only difference I can see But, they should work the same.

I'm extremely happy with my Ruckus solution, I have it running with 50 access points throughout the 3 buildings here on campus. I actually just replaced a hodgepodge of Airports in the one building with Ruckus APs and it has made life so much easier. Like I explained to the admins here, Airports are a consumer level device with consumer level features and support.   If you can make Rukus work with your budget, I would definitely look into it; it's super easy to set up and manage and I don't think the price is too bad."

I remember pricing out licencing a year or so ago and I don't remember it being too outrageous, at least when compared to Cisco kit. If I had to take a guess, with e-rate funding, you could probably redo your whole wireless infrastructure for 20-25k (Controller + APs). Since you're already so invested in Cisco kit, it might be worth sticking with Cisco gear; can't go wrong with them, but you definitely pay a premium price. The 40k quote seems extremely high, I would definitely get quotes from other vendors.  Do you have any contacts that are knowledge about e-rate funding?

You need to come up with a politically correct way to tell the super and other administration that buying airport extremes is a terrible idea. Not only do they not support the features you will need to make your 1:1 deployment successful, they will be a nightmare to manage and troubleshoot.   I'm just throwing ideas out there now, have you priced out any autonomous Cisco APs? This should get you by and you can convert them to lightweight access points in the future. They also have a CLI that you can use to push changes out rapidly with a python script."
networking,3d9vff,sid351,3,Wed Jul 15 13:34:14 2015 UTC,Its hard to get executives to understand the soft costs. Like if you need to make a WLAN configuration change and you have 40 individual AirPort Extremes its going to take you 40 times as long to make the change. Also they don't realize that a consumer grade product is meant to be used in surprise surprise a consumer level setting. So upgrading your wireless infrastructure to give kids a leg up but skimping on the solution is really only hurting them when all the kids get on wifi and it comes to a screeching halt. Not to mention from a troubleshooting perspective. Time to resolution will go way up when you have 40 spots to look for a problem vs one single pane of glass and you can see the entire network.
networking,3d9vff,beef-o-lipso,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I definitely agree with you.  I keep telling them without a controller, I have to individually update each access point one by one if I ever need to make a change.  My boss said it's not that hard to go to each IP address and make a change.  Then my tech director, who doesn't know much about technology, which is another story, said ""How often do we make changes to the wireless?""  It just frustrates me working in a situation where someone knows just enough about technology to be dangerous.  Around the time I started here, they had a bunch of different access points and couldn't figure out why they would drop their signal when they would walk from one access point to another."
networking,3d9vff,theragu40,2,Tue Jul 14 17:56:22 2015 UTC,Yeah individually each change is 5 mins work.  With a controller that's 1 x 5 min job.  Without that's 50 x 5 min jobs (+ you are busy doing then instead of something of more value to the organization)
networking,3d9vff,ihavescripts,3,Tue Jul 14 19:29:48 2015 UTC,"for Aruba, Airohive, and Cisco you'll be paying for the AP + an annual subscription for each AP. These are ""controllerless"" in the sense that if you loose connectivity to the service, the AP's still run, but they can't be managed.   Meru is less expensive with just a subscription cost which includes both the service and the AP while with Ruckus you buy the AP and the cloud service is free.   As /u/prairieWiFi said, the management cost of individual AP's is very high. You have no hope of a centralized view of the network which impacts operations and troubleshooting. It will significantly increase operations cost as changes have to be made to each individual AP each time a change is needed. It's simply a poor decision past 5-6 AP's and an insane decision at 80 AP's. A simple change that takes 2 minutes per AP to complete turns into 2 hours and 40 minutes of your time assuming you make no mistakes.   Plus, with these services you get support and so on."

networking,3d8vce,ClydeMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"If you're asking how a summary address is determined, you'll want to re-familiarize yourself with subnetting and looking at the 1's and 0's.  You could notate the networks in binary notation as follows:   172.16.4.0/24: 10101100.00010000.00000100.00000000 172.16.5.0/24: 10101100.00010000.00000101.00000000 172.16.6.0/24: 10101100.00010000.00000110.00000000   Therefore, the wildcard mask that accommodates all of the networks you've listed is 0.0.3.255, notated in binary as such:   0.0.3.255: 00000000.00000000.00000011.11111111   Now armed with this knowledge, you determine that the summary address that will summarize these three networks is the largest of them, 172.16.4.0/22. It can't be 172.16.5.0/24 because that would not cover the 172.16.4.0/24 network, and it can't be 172.16.6.0/24 because that wouldn't cover either 172.16.4.0/24 nor 172.16.5.0/24.  Make sense?

networking,3d8vce,ClydeMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is more along the lines of what I meant. Thank you. I apologise for the bad wording of the original question, my head's a little bit fuzzy due to strong painkillers that I'm taking. Hopefully I can word this a little clearer.  As I understand it, wildcard masking is essentially performing a bitwise NOT operation on the subnet mask.   The specific part that I'm not grasping is how to arrive at the conclusion that the subnet mask is a /22 from the original /24's. Admittedly, sub-netting is my definite weak point due to having dyscalculia which makes working with numbers quite difficult for me. Hence looking for a sort of ""idiot's guide to determining subnets"""
networking,3d8vce,ClydeMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the further detail, hope this is helping.  You've got it right with regard to determining the wildcard mask. Now, when you have that wildcard mask, you simply choose the network address that leaves the most bits open for use with regard to everything that's covered in that mask. Since 172.16.4.0 only uses the first available bit slot that isn't covered by the 00000011.11111111 wildcard mask, that is the optimal summary address to account for the networks that the scenario requests. Therefore, 172.16.4.0/22 is the optimal summary address.  You arrive at the CIDR notation of /22 by looking at what bits are used for the summary address. This would look like:   172.16.4.0/22: 10101100.00010000.00000100.00000000   Since the ""4"" slot in the third octet of the binary notation above is set with a 1 binary value, that means the network address has been defined by the 22 slots (bolded) prior to it - hence, /22. If you look at the network defined as 172.16.5.0/24, for example, it is defined by the 24 slots prior to its open bits:   172.16.5.0/24: 10101100.00010000.00000101.00000000   If you don't already have one, a subnetting cheat sheet like this one can help wrap your head around this material.

networking,3d8hmo,syncopatedbreathing,2,Tue Jul 14 10:05:25 2015 UTC,Reading through the rest of your answers you might have better luck with a 10 gigabit pass through modules and then have the servers connect directly to your core infrastructure. Depending upon your individual blade configuration and pass though options you could possibly get between two and eight 10 gigabit uplinks per server. However if the goal is to spend no money in leverage your existing infrastructure then LACP or other link aggregation protocols will be your best bet.

If you require single 10G streams, go shopping for 10G NIC:s and VirtualConnects. Just be careful with buying new VirtualConnects, I recall the FlexFabric ones having some bandwidth-related drawbacks in some situations...

networking,3d59yi,nkripper,4,Sun Jul 19 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"A MIB just defines all of the objects in the ""tree"". There are standard MIBs and enterprise MIBs. Standard MIBs contain information such as the device name, uptime, interface counters, etc. Anything outside of the standard MIBs, the vendor has to implement their own objects. The company applies for an enterprise OID (object identifier), then they have their own branch of the OID ""tree"" to implement any vendor specific objects.  Think of a MIB as a file that defines the object tree. What you are actually querying are objects in the tree. You don't need a copy of the MIBs if you know what objects you want.  You really only need to know a couple of things: What MIB's did the vendor implement for the equipment you are trying to query, what information you are looking to query, the OID values for that information.  I've never used powershell, but I have written perl scripts to grab OID values  Edit: Just wanted to answer one more question. A MIB browser will just compile MIB's and can provide a detailed view of the OID tree. Most MIB browsers can also query the OID's for you, mainly for testing."
networking,3d59yi,kombiwombi,5,Mon Jul 13 19:16:36 2015 UTC,"A MIB does two things simultaneously:   it specifies the names and datatypes the variables you can possibly collect. That specification jumbles together the technical (the name and datatype), the metadata (what exactly the variable represents, is this variable even implemented), the managerial (is this variable currently recommended for use), and the cultural. in an attempt to be efficient SNMP doesn't send names over the wire, it uses lists of numbers called ""object IDs"" instead. So the MIB contains the mapping from variable names to object IDs.   A MIB is designed to be both human readable and compilable. A MIB browser simply presents the MIB in a format which works better on the web (to do this it compiles the MIB and extracts the information about the variables). A nice side-effect of MIB browsers is that they make a nice collection of MIBs (sometimes MIBs can be difficult to find).  As far as programming is concerned, you can simply give a Object ID and you'll get a value back. For example, using the Net-SNMP tools:  snmpget -v 1 -c public localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0   where ""1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0"" is the object ID for ""sysDescr"" (system description). The full symbolic name of that object ID is  iso(1).org (3).dod(6).internet(1).mgmt(2).mib-2(1).system(1).sysDescr(1)   and a lot of systems will also allow that to be given as MIBname::variable, so  SNMPv2-MIB::system.sysDescr  snmpget -v 1 -c public -m SNMPv2-MIB localhost system.sysDescr.0   When you write a MIB-using program you are faced with some unpleasant choices. If you try to make life easy for the user then you will use DNS names for hosts and symbolic names for MIB variables. This is a lot of overhead of DNS lookups and of MIB parsing. Especially if you are invoked for every interface of every network element. Alternatively you can require the user to give IP addresses and Object IDs, which has all the usability of assembler. Most large SNMP-using programs end up compiling the MIBs to an intermediate form which is easily loaded, and caching DNS values. The biggest programs cache SNMP results too (because a switch with a 1000 ports prefers one walk of the SNMP table, not 1000 probes for each interface).  Possibly the biggest issue with SNMP is the fact that interfaces are referenced by ifIndex (a number which can change upon system restart or card re-insertion) and not interface name. The only realistic way forward is to scan ifXTable.ifName and ifTable.ifDescr to build an interface name(1). Then cache that name, system.sysUpTime,   ifXTable.ifCounterDiscontinuityTime and ifIndex. Then rediscover the current name -- ifIndex relationship upon invalidation of sysUptime or ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.  You also need to be aware that ifXTable has 64-bit counters, use those in preference to the 32-bit counters in ifTable. Do store which bit-depth was used, as at some point you'll need to deal with counter roll-over.  As you can see, a good SNMP library can save a lot of trouble, although sadly most libraries are focussed on the operation of the SNMP protocol rather than helping with the data issues.  For a large site you're much better off interposing a cache between the SNMP-using applications and the end systems. And once you've done that the SNMP-using applications may as well use ASCII text than stuffing around with Object IDs. The database-filling program may as well keep all database counters as 64-bit, deal with roll-overs, deal with ifIndex changes, and so on. I use Redis as the cache and it works extremely well for the task (which isn't to say that memcached or similar wouldn't work well too). The cache saves CPU on the monitored systems (just one BULKWALK per five minutes), makes the applications faster (everything is at 0ms round-trip time), and makes the applications simpler to write (no OIDs or other wierdness), and can give applications easy access to historical samples (in my case I do five minute SNMP samples but expire them out of Redis after 30 minutes).  For filling the cache, it's a trivial change to Torrus to have it fill Redis rather than fill a RRD. Alternatively, you can use a soft-state approach and have Nagios kick off the access to the monitored host, do the BULKWALK and fill the database. If you do that then Nagios will kick off a thundering herd of queries, so you need to use Redis' pub/sub to hold off most of the herd whilst one of them goes and walks the target.  (1) I'll give a hint here. If ifName exists and is represented by only one ifIndex then use it. If there are multiple ifNames for a ifIndex then use the ifName of the ifIndex with the shortest ifDescr. For the remaining ifIndex, take sysDescr, strip spaces and use that modified sysDescr as the interface name."

Unfortunately, my experience is that these types of TimeTick indicators frequently get broken in some vendor implementations, to the point where I just don't trust them at all.  Same goes for a vendor-specific ifindex persistence mechanism.  Depending on your ecosystem, global fixed interval refreshes may be required.   You also need to be aware that ifXTable has 64-bit counters, use those in preference to the 32-bit counters in ifTable. Do store which bit-depth was used, as at some point you'll need to deal with counter roll-over.   Similar random breakage happens here too.  IF-MIB specifies that the 64-bit counters must be supported if the interface speed is greater than or equal to 20Mbps, and yet I frequently find devices where anything less than 1Gbps either has a zero value 64-bit row, or even no row at all for that particular ifIndex."

The wrinkle with ifCounterDiscontinuityTime is that values can't be compared either side of it. So many wrinkles in SNMP it's a wonder it works at all :-(   Similar random breakage happens here too   Sigh. The SNMP cache-creating program I wrote has around 1100 lines in snmptweak.py, which deals with shortcomings in various platforms, mostly based upon their sysDescr. A typical example would be the Cisco 6500-series Supervisor Engine 2, which increments EtherLike-MIB::dot3StatsFrameTooLongs on every frame greater than 1500 bytes, even if MTU>1500.  Those tweaks were by far the most difficult bit of code to write cleanly, and I'm still not happy with it.   global fixed interval refreshes may be required   That's not too bad to do, the trick is to do it lazily. That is, after you've filled the cache, then kick off a process to check integrity. The target platform is more passive-aggresive than openly hostile, so it needs some excuse to change ifIndex. So if Nagios returns odd values for five minutes after a device reboots/card insert then no one will care too much."

Most real world use-cases have some type of monitoring application polling specific OIDs and graping and/or alerting based on values.  On using a browser app - if the vendor is either using the proper standard MIBs - or they have properly made and supplied their MIBs -and- those are loaded into your browser, it will give you human-friendly text instead of just a string of numbers and then a value. Note that this is possible using the netsnmp package, but you may find its alot easier to load MIBs using a browser."

From the comcast network there, it is peered up directly with google.

That is an oversimplification, as there could be devices in the path not showing up that don't respond to layer3 as they are doing only layer1/2 crud, but you got a pretty good map.      You can then sit back and probe different addresses that are owned in the net ranges above and see how they trace and start making conclusions.

There are corner cases where jumbo is required such as FCoE or FCIP for storage, but in most cases these are LAN only or private WAN which will support jumbo.

networking,3d5rdu,Electr0freak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:38:33 2015 UTC,"Also there are many cases where path MTU discovery is broken due to people filtering IMCP which means you get weird problems like browsing to some sites works and others does not.    First time I ran into this it had me flabbergasted. Now when I hear about it, I ask if anyone's been fooling with MTU sizes and usually get a sheepish response.   Thanks for noting the minimal MTU performance gains too. I've seen network admins get it into their heads that it's going to magically resolve their throughput issues with coast to coast CIFS file transfers over their Windows 2003 server environment and they will argue stubbornly in favor of it while the rest of the network sits around them in shambles."
networking,3d5rdu,bmcgahan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:07:43 2015 UTC,"It's a very interesting problem, because you'd assume 1500 MTU and 1460 TCP MSS (~3% overhead) vs. 9000 MTU and 8960 TCP MSS (~.5% overhead) would save you 240 bytes of overhead (6 x 1500 vs. 1 x 9000), and that it would add up over time.  In most practical cases though that doesn't even matter.  It's more issues of things like storage IOPS that really make a difference.  At the network speeds we deal with now it's rarely a bandwidth saturation problem.  Very very few servers can saturate a 10GigE circuit, even with lots of VMs running on the host.  Once you get to that point you generally need to scale up or scale out CPU/RAM/Storage IOPS."
networking,3d5rdu,Electr0freak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:18:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I've even seen it come down to memory limitations server-side because the server has to hold TCP windows for potential retransmits. Or drops occurring because of Cisco gear not configured for Ethernet Overhead accounting. Etc etc... the only real gain I can appreciate on high MTU links is the reduced forwarding overhead for the processor under very high pps load...

networking,3d5rdu,kWV0XhdO,3,Mon Jul 13 21:09:04 2015 UTC,IETF (through RFCs) allows IP datagrams up to 64KB. It's the IEEE that limits Ethernet to 1500 bytes.
networking,3d5rdu,Cheeze_It,3,Tue Jul 14 00:53:21 2015 UTC,I stand corrected. Thank you sir.
networking,3d5rdu,Electr0freak,2,Tue Jul 14 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"I really hate it when people focus on MTU when ""optimizing"" the network. The 2-dozen byte overhead on a 1500-byte Ethernet frame is a fairly small percentage of the total frame size, and moving to larger MTU sizes will earn you a couple percent more throughput.  Honestly the vast majority of the time, performance can be improved much more significantly in other ways. Large MTU sizes can be set on high-pps p2p links to reduce processor load if it's an issue but otherwise it's usually best left alone."
networking,3d5rdu,pugl33t,4,Tue Jul 14 01:57:53 2015 UTC,"Most modern NICs have TCP Segment Offload enabled which reduces the amount of interrupts, so a larger MTU doesn't give you a performance gain."

networking,3d5rdu,kombiwombi,2,Mon Jul 13 21:10:24 2015 UTC,"The rule is that MTU has to be consistent with a subnet.  The default Ethernet MTU is 1500. In a general use subnet that's what you have to use. Ditto wireless.  The servers can be in their own subnet and run jumbo frames (9000). You want to do this, our experience is that there's a 3x win on disk-to-disk throughput, and since you want to back up those servers...  The backbone should run at the highest MTU it can, whilst remembering the prime directive about all interfaces in a Subnet having the same MTU. The reason for this is that routing protocol convergence is much quicker with fewer PDUs, and you want some bytes for MPLS and tunnels. Do not run a backbone MTU under 1500.  All the MSS manipulation and so on comes in when people bridge across different MTUs. Don't do that and you don't need it. Unfortunately the model for IPv4 ADSL was originally bridging."

If you do it right, hosts in the same site could talk to 9000, and will talk to each other across the wan at 2000, thanks to PMTUD.

This was around 18 months back or so, maybe they fixed it in a new ios update, but we had to put some work arounds in place.  So basically just watch out with routing protocols and mtu."

networking,3d5rdu,kWV0XhdO,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:52:05 2015 UTC,"Technically, no, the hosts don't negotiate MTU, not unless they're running something like PPP at layer 2.  Hosts generally negotiate the layer 4 payload size as the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS).  The problem typically is that when the default MTU is 1500 the hosts negotiate an MSS of 1460 (1500 - 20 byte IP header - 20 byte TCP header).  However if the packet is going over other encapsulations in the middle (IPsec, GRE, MPLS, L2TPv3, etc.) the total payload size can exceed 1500, in which case it may be dropped.  Negotiation of MTU does occur in the routing protocol control plane of OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP by default, as an attempt to make sure that the control plane doesn't establish in cases that the data plane could fail due to packets being too large.  An example of this is OSPF and MTU Mismatch  It seems counter-intuitive, but in most cases you actually want your MTU small, not large, so that you explicitly avoid problems with extra encapsulation overheads in the transit path between the end applications."

I can't really get on board with this statement. We're talking about an IP issue here (MTU). MSS negotiation is a function of one IP application (TCP).  I agree that TCP will generally not be impacted by MSS mismatches (routed or otherwise) because modern implementations will use MSS to work around that problem.  But the problem is bigger than just TCP, and to suggest that MSS takes care of things ignores protocols which are not TCP, and which will have problems related to IP MTU.   It seems counter-intuitive, but in most cases you actually want your MTU small   This statement, I can fully get behind :)  The headaches that come with half-assed attempts at jumbo frames just aren't worth the (hypothetical) performance benefit in most cases.  edit: s/MSS mismatches/MTU mismatches/"

The network can force lower MSS into the 3 way handshake (e.g. ip tcp adjust-mss) which then implicitly changes the MTU of the packet, because the layer 3 and 4 header sizes are fixed (40 bytes).  Also this ""generally"" because most applications are generally TCP based."
networking,3d5rdu,bmcgahan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you're saying, I just think that MSS handshaking (as it relates to jumbo frames and IP MTU) is slightly unfortunate. It masks a configuration error, and I view that masking as a bug, not a feature."

This is because other encapsulation overheads like MPLS L2VPN, L3VPN, TE FRR, etc. will add additional overhead to the packet.

networking,3d57e7,stevepork,5,Mon Jul 13 16:51:02 2015 UTC,"Having just enabled IPv6 on my home network, I can add a few comments here.  As /u/r0lav has said, NAT isn't a security protocol, it just has the side effect of dropping traffic it doesn't understand. When you enable IPv6 you're going to want a proper security method, this would be a stateful firewall, which allows through packets based on requests started from inside your network.  Addressing, ideally you'll need to assign a /64 to each segment of the network, so looking at the diagram above you'll need two of them. If your ISP only gives a /64 this is obviously a problem...  Local servers, in NAT you can do a portforward, but with IPv6, you just need a rule to let the packets through, nice and easy, right? Unfortunately, many ISPs provide a dynamic IPv6 prefix, so the external addresses of your devices will change from time to time. In my case, I've managed to make an ACL rule that ignores the first 64-bits, so I just have to know the last 64-bits which is fixed based on the devices MAC address. I don't know how consumer level routers will provide this functionality."
networking,3d57e7,madbobmcjim,2,Mon Jul 13 18:56:07 2015 UTC,"I never looked at NAT as a security protocol, I probably should've written that it has a side effect of dropping traffic.... My thinking is that it kinda works like a firewall after all...  Is the /64 the smallest subnet IPv6 allows or something? Perhaps I've got that wrong but if so that's insane. My allocated IPs are static too so thankfully I shouldn't have an issue. I'm also hoping to switch to UTM next weekend."
networking,3d57e7,Xipher,2,Mon Jul 13 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"/64 is the intended subnet size for general use. While others will work it's not designed that way. The only time it's suggested to use anything longer then /64 is when you're doing point to points, and then you might see /127 or /126."

networking,3d57e7,FriendlyDespot,3,Mon Jul 13 19:11:55 2015 UTC,"Stateless auto config won't work on anything but /64, and I think DHCPv6 is in the same boat as they both require IPv6 router advertisement messages which is where a prefix length is not currently a included item. If you do anything except /64 it's going to require static assignments.  The point to points are usually those between routers inside the network infrastructure. These are going to be statically assigned anyways. The benefit there is avoiding ping pong and neighbor table exhaustion attacks. More about that can be found in RFC6164."

networking,3d57e7,FriendlyDespot,2,Mon Jul 13 21:24:56 2015 UTC,"That's not what stateful means. Stateful just means that the firewall or NAT correlates packets into connections and works on those connections, rather than on the individual packets.  If you only have NAT:  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE   then your ISP will be able to connect to hosts on your network. If you also reject new inbound connections:  iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j REJECT   then sure, they won't be able to.

Stateful NAT does not allow traffic to come through unless state has been established, because without state to reference it does not know how to translate.

All they have to do is send a packet to your router with a dest address of 192.168.1.42 or whatever, and it'll forward it unless otherwise configured not to. The NAT won't do anything to those packets, because the NAT only affects outbound connections.   While you may be able to hack and slash things in and out of NAT with iptables, it has no bearing on the real world.   I'm not ""hacking and slashing"" anything.

You're right that is ""incidental"", though. It depends on the scenario, but generalizing that ""NAT implies security"" would be false.  First let me just get the obvious out of the way: the goal of the table lookup in NAT is not to apply a policy but to find the appropriate translation entry in order to let the packet pass through. The goal of the table lookup in a stateful firewall is to find the appropriate policy to apply to the packet. In other words: the job of NAT is to let packets through unless it can't while the job of a stateful firewall is the opposite: to not let packets through unless there is a reason to.  About applying policy: it means to able to let packets go through or have them dropped. In NAT you can't let packets through unless you also do port forwarding.

With port forwarding (static port NAT) the job gets done with a static entry, so security doesn't matter much because it is not a stateful firewall.  Also stateful firewalls will give you security that [your particular case of] NAT won't: stateful firewalls will also prevent ""outside"" connections from connecting to the ""inside"" even if address translation is not used.  Yes, there is this incidental overlap between the algorithms and some kinds of NAT can, in some cases give you some security, but generalizing that ""NAT gives security"" is false. Promoting the idea can be very misleading to newly interested users / network enthusiasts.  That's why, in IPv6, where the NAT kludge is finally removable (to restore the end-to-end communication nature of the Internet) each host should have its own host-based stateful firewall."
networking,3d57e7,madbobmcjim,2,Tue Jul 14 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"Only those types of NAT that require per-connection packet correlation to work can give you some kind of security. You're right that is ""incidental"", though. It depends on the scenario, but generalizing that ""NAT implies security"" would be false.   These are the types of NATs that exist in the real world. You'll rarely happen upon a 1:1 NAT that's facing outbound, and since OP isn't talking about those, then when he's suggesting that his NAT provided (incidental) security in v4 that he would need a stateful firewall in v6 to achieve, then he's absolutely right.   First let me just get the obvious out of the way: the goal of the table lookup in NAT is not to apply a policy but to find the appropriate translation entry in order to let the packet pass through.

In other words: the job of NAT is to let packets through unless it can't while the job of a stateful firewall is the opposite: to not let packets through unless there is a reason to.   And functionally there's a 100% overlap between the outcome of these in the kind of network that OP is talking about. Understand that I'm repeatedly saying that it's functionally the same, because it is. The academic distinctions don't really matter when the outcome is the same.

There's a difference between a basic stateful firewall and a stateful firewall with policy implementation. Farther up the thread another user showed us an iptables stateful firewall that enforced absolutely no policy. That's still a stateful firewall. Whether or not your specific implementation of NAT is granular enough in its policy (and yes, you can set specific source networks for NAT translations in most modern CPEs, because it's a core feature of NAT) is not the question, because for every lackluster implementation of NAT out there you'll find an equally lackluster firewall product.   Also stateful firewalls will give you security that [your particular case of] NAT won't: stateful firewalls will also prevent ""outside"" connections from connecting to the ""inside"" even if address translation is not used.   Pretty much every single situation where you have a domestic CPE running NAT no outside connection will ever connect to the inside without NAT state being present. You're not going to reach RFC1918 addresses from a remote network, and you're not going to reach internal unannounced prefixes either, unless you're the upstream ISP, the NAT implementation is poor, and as you as the ISP know exactly which prefixes are in use inside the client network. That's not a realistic situation.   Yes, there is this incidental overlap between the algorithms and some kinds of NAT can, in some cases give you some security, but generalizing that ""NAT gives security"" is false. Promoting the idea can be very misleading to newly interested users / network enthusiasts.   Saying that NAT doesn't offer some form of security is false. I'd argue any day that NAT as a feature has mitigated more threats on the Internet than anything else, ever. More or less every home network is NATed, while very few home networks and very few hosts sit behind a firewall. Just saying that ""NAT isn't security"" when there are patently obvious security implications whether intended or incidental is very misleading to newly interested users, who think that they're missing something that they aren't missing. What new users need to hear is why NAT offers a measure of security, and why they shouldn't rely on it for security. Telling them that ""NAT isn't security"" and moving on helps neither their understanding of NAT nor of security concepts."

I couldn't find anything in the manual for your router detailing how the firewall operates in either mode - with IPv4, you have the ""benefit"" of non-routable addresses (RFC1918), which means that a device outside your network can't connect to a device inside the network without NAT forwarding the request.  IPv6 does offer ephemeral addresses via SLAAC, and most OSes have the privacy extensions enabled, so you get a new IP in your /64 every 10 minutes or so, making a number of attacks extremely difficult (even impossible) to do.  Yes, /64 is the smallest you can get for IPv6 to be happy. Most ISPs delegate a single /64 to their customers, unless you ask for a bigger network. My router requests a /56 and gets it, but that took some manual programming of the DHCP client, I doubt the ASUS will let you do that - so you'll likely get a single /64, and the ASUS will use Route Advertisement to hand out addresses via SLAAC on this subnet."

networking,3d57e7,r0lav,7,Mon Jul 13 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"IPv6 does not bypass your firewall - and NAT isn't a security protocol.  Your firewall (either the one built in to your current router or another, such as pfSense) needs to block all incoming traffic by default. You can choose to allow the traffic that needs to be allowed.  Assuming this is your network setup:  [ISP]--[Modem]--[Router]--[Internal Network]  Here's what's currently happening, if you run a web server:  Visitor: Hi, I'm 1.2.3.4, and I'd like to browse your website at 5.6.7.8:443!  Modem: Here, this router is handling 5.6.7.8.  Router: Hello, I'm 5.6.7.8. My firewall allows you to connect to port 443, and I'll pass you off to the server that handles that.  Server: Here's your webpage.  Nothing will change if you move to IPv6, except that the visitor will ask for something like 2a0::1, and your modem will say, ""here, this router handles it"", and your router will say, ""here's the client"".

My firewall is enabled on my router but I'm going to try and switch to UTM next weekend and separate my IPv4 network. Hopefully it may expand my knowledge!"
networking,3d57e7,Dagger0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to ""know"" - it just has to allow the rule through the firewall.

Obviously the same behaviour won’t follow suit with IPv6   Sure it will. Do you connect with a DNS name now?  Let's say you connect to ssh.example.com, on port 22 currently. You have an A record set up in DNS to point to your public IP address, and your router forwards the traffic through to port 22 on your internal network.  You'll set up an AAAA record (IPv6 version of an A record) for ssh.example.com pointing to your IPv6 address. You could also set up ssh6.example.com, if you're into that sort of thing (to force your clients to connect to IPv6).

If your phones' integrated switch is gigabit and you already own them, sure, it can work out for most scenarios, if your switches support QoS.  If your phones are only 100mbit, and you'll be doing any sort of roaming profile, NAS access, etc., then things will be slow for your users.  Often, running a second cable to provide gigabit to your phones is cheaper than buying new phones.

By the time you do that so it doesn't look like crap, it will be more expensive than just running them through the walls.  Yes, your boss is trying to keep costs down, but keep in mind that the cost of running cable will likely be only a very, very small fraction of what you'll pay in rent for the duration you'll be in that office.  Tell your boss that there are times to really cut corners, and that the cabling isn't one of them.  Shoot, most office space these days,the building management will offer to reimburse for some of the buildout.  Not necessarily in cash, but in free months rent.

If you have a good setup, you could throw the NPS logs to a SQL server, then the report would be far better, easier, and more efficient then parsing a text log file.  This will work for a device count to determine when, who, and what logged in, however, it will not work if you want login durations.  EDIT: this was meant for the authentication and logging/reporting of the captive portal, not the portal itself.

You don't have to run DMVPN over a public internet connection, but if you don't, all your routers need to be on the same routing domain. Basically, the NBMA address need to be able to communicate with each other. You can get around this if you do a Phase 1 DMVPN type of approach and tunnel all traffic back to the hub with no direct spoke-to-spoke connectivity. In this case, make A or B your hub router.   Edit: I may have misread your diagram. Are you trying to run DMVPN on the other 15 routers? If you are not, you just need redistribute your 15 sites' networks into whatever routing process you're using in the DMVPN cloud, and vise-versa for the DMVPN routes into the WAN.

I suggest you look at your DMVPN/NHRP configuration and make sure it is correct. Then, look at your routing configuration inside DMVPN. What protocol are you running in your DMVPN cloud? Most people run EIGRP, RIP, or BGP. I prefer BGP. Check this out for setting that up. You need to make sure router C is seeing all the proper routes for your remote sites, and that your remote sites see the routes for router C.

See article: https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/paloaltonetworks-com/en_US/assets/pdf/technology-solutions-briefs/citrix/panw-netscaler-exchange.pdf (This is a deployment guide for Exchange - using Palo Alto and Netscaler)  In particular section 8.2 - Security Policy. This has all the necessary App-ID functions needed to enable communication.  For us RPC was the culprit. RPC uses TCP 135 for initial communication, then randomly picks ports 1024+ for service communication. The 'simplest' solution is using App-ID, the other solutions involve registry hacks of the Exchange servers or allowing ports 1024+ through (both not ideal)."

Without the payload decrypted first, the Palo would have no idea what traffic is inside the payload, so I don't think having a rule on for msrpc would apply. The reason we were seeing it in the logs is that the Outlook client tries it first before OA, then uses OA once the MAPI connection fails. In our case, the Palo is doing something different and the Outlook client never tried to use OA instead of MAPI."

If you used something like the Palo Alto Migration Tool then I would recommend verifying everything converted properly. Even with the recent improvements, the tool is not 100%.   If you're also doing NAT, take a quick read on how NAT works on the Palo Altos. It's important to understand the Palo Alto packet flow .  Filter Examples   ( addr.dst in 'YOUR_EXCHANGE_PUBLIC_IPS' )  ( addr.dst in 'YOUR_EXCHANGE_PUBLIC_IPS' ) and ( action neq 'allow' )  ( zone.dst eq 'EXCHANGE_ZONE' )   If you find matching logs, click the magnifying glass.

networking,3d2b9o,clay584,2,Sun Jul 12 23:35:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. All traffic is allowed in the logs, with the exception of RPC traffic which we see the Palo actively blocking with the implied deny_all rule. We actually ran into an issue where the Palo was allowing the socket to open on port 135, but the just dropping traffic from there. That is wrecking havoc with Outlook's RPC detection it seems. So we put in a explicit deny rule that actively blocks port 135 at layer 4. I am already working with TAC, but they seem as confounded as we do. It seems to be an architectural thing with the Palo that we couldn't foresee. Apparently, it's how they do their layer 7 filtering decisions by allowing the connection to open then seeing what it does.  Having Outlook force to use http above rpc on fast networks does seem to resolve the issue, but that doesn't help my 1500+ users out in the field with non-domain connected machines that don't have this setting enabled."
networking,3d2b9o,sudoraymond,3,Sun Jul 12 23:50:38 2015 UTC,"MSRPC protocol uses TCP/135 to dynamically negotiate higher port ranges to use for transport.  You must not block it.  Once it negotiated it's transport (at the application layer... this is analogous to FTP passive mode) the client and the sender will start using those higher ports.  When load balancing Exchange 2010 I use all ports for the CAS arrays because RPC sucks.  Then I also permit TCP/135 and all TCP and UDP ports greater than 1024 in the firewall.  You can actually permit just the ports used for RPC if you want, but MS changes the default ranges with every major windows release.  You will have to look up the range.  Microsoft sucks by the way because they still use this antiquated protocol.  EDIT:  Also MS left us with this hidden gem.  RPC, since it is acting as a transport mechanism, has a timeout similar to a NAT or connection table would in a firewall.  It is 7200 seconds.  So, in order not to get random errors with the GAL and other things in Outlook after some period of user inactivity, you must set your load balancing VIP for Exchange 2010 to have a TCP timeout of greater than 7200 seconds."

This. You're absolutely correct. In order to do Layer 7 inspection (App-ID on the PAs) traffic must be allowed so that the headers and/or payload can be evaluated. See this doc for more information.  You've already mentioned you're only writing Layer 4 rules. PA's big win is their Layer 7 App-ID system. Try writing an inbound rule that allows ""msrpc"" application. You can read more in the Application tab or here. Leveraging an application, Palo Alto will inspect the traffic and identify whether or not the traffic is permissible. For an ""app"" like msrpc, this will greatly reduce your need for mapping high-ports.   Note: Make sure to pay attention to the ""depends-on"" field of the application description.

The fact that it's so widely known that it's referenced in shows like Silicon Valley should tell you that it's not what it appears to be.  You should know that the American government has their hands in this as kind of a honeypot.

It's become clear over the past few years that there is no way to ""beat"" the NSA using technology.  The game is rigged kid.  Find that offensive?  Good.    Become politically active and support groups like the ACLU and EFF to dismantle the surveillance state.  Write your local congressmen when relevant legislation comes up.  Vote for politicians who share your privacy concerns.  It's seemingly futile but it's better than just sitting there and doing nothing.  Companies are already deploying technology that let's them intercept SSL connections and do a MITM attack on you.  It's a ""feature"" called SSL Inspection that's available on commercial firewalls.  In many cases the user doesn't even know it's happening.  All they need to do is run an application to ""setup their network"" when they connect.  As we speak the director of the FBI is asking for the ability to force software companies to build in ""backdoors"" for all encryption because they say they can't do their job when things are encrypted.  So instead of just the NSA having the ability to watch you they want to extend it down to normal federal and local law enforcement.  I hate to sound doom and gloom but this is where we are.  Anyway the point is that if you need to ask if you'll be hacked you have no chance of protecting yourself once you're on someones radar.  You need to operate with the assumption that you will be hacked and are being watched.  Snowden handed encrypted data over in person for a reason."

To answer your questions:   No, you're not out of line to consider the SG500X line, though you may not actually need the 8F8T If everything is in the same spot and stacked. You still have (2) 10Gbe ports per switch once stacked. I do, though keep in mind that if you're routing here instead of pfSense that you'll lose more advanced filtering options you've got there.

Yes, you shouldn't have any issue with those cables (or the generic equivalents).  I've used them with Intel & Broadcom cards.  Honestly, the only time I use optics and fiber are for running between rooms, not from switch to switch or switch to server in the same room.  Copper DA cables are lower latency, substantially cheaper, and use slightly less power.  Watch out for scaling back on the access switches.  The SG300 are nice, I use the 10-port versions at work for access points where I don't have 2960-X switches yet (in the process of switching from Dell to Cisco for switching, and from Ubiquiti to Meraki for WiFi), but they don't have 10Gbe uplinks.

For most jobs, you will be doing either networking or system administration but not both.  Even for jobs that do include both, the marginal value of having the additional cert probably isn't that much.  Your experience will matter much more.  The CCNA/CCNP typically will command a higher salary than the MCSE, but you should choose what you like better.  I definitely think they are worth the price/effort."

Absolutely! Certs are a pretty good way of efficiently learning topics and conveying your skill level.  Should you pursue them? Nope stay in the junior level for awhile until you have some experience to your name.  Also if your thinking in terms of $$$ value then your doing these things wrong.

Check reviews on Amazon first.  For practice GNS3 is great. As you go up the R&S ladder you can buy some real L3 switches and quad NICS and use virtual routers with live switches (switch emulation sucks). L3 3550\3560\3750 are dirt cheap these days.  For quald NICS a PCI-X NIC will fit into a standard PCI slot if there is physical room for it and work even though the back half connector is hanging in the breeze. This is what i did for my R&S lab as it is much easier to switch topologies and meant i could sell my routers.  If you are using IoL the PC does not even need to be that beefy. Ideally something with 3 big pci slots that will run 3x quad nics means you can do 360 and INE (might have changed for v5 i did v4)

MPIO needs to be able to see all the different NIC's it's working with to create proper paths - NIC Teaming will 'hide' the different NIC's.  MPIO has specific technologies built into it to help it handle disconnection from a storage device. It should be used so long as all technologies along all paths between the consumer (server) and storage device support MPIO. If this isn't the case, you can fall back to NIC Teaming, but you'll likely lose throughput (again, depends on the teaming software) and will lose all the protocol-specific items for dealing with storage device connection failures.  You generally would not use MPIO outside of connecting to a storage device."

networking,3czhm2,flaming_m0e,2,Sun Jul 12 18:10:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you want to balance the traffic. You could use a link aggregation group (AKA port channel/etherchannel). This allows you to use the bundle as a single interface and optionally use LACP as an assisting protocol. However you will probably want to keep it in groups of 2, 4, or 8 because of the way the hashing usually works. Odd groupings tend to result in uneven distribution, at least that's traditionally been the problem.  There are plenty of alternative methods too, each one has strengths and trade offs. Some of it will depend on your topology and what kind of features you have at your disposal."

networking,3czhm2,Newdles,2,Sun Jul 12 05:02:34 2015 UTC,You need to be more specific about your situation and what you're trying to do. What device is passing them traffic? Generally each interface has it's separate IP mapped to the virtual IP of the device upstream that would be doing the actual load balancing.
networking,3czhm2,No1Asked4MyOpinion,2,Sun Jul 12 05:04:00 2015 UTC,Nic teaming. You team them before assigning any IPs and then assign your IP to the logical nic team interface.

networking,3cyjk3,akirchhoff,4,Sun Jul 12 00:03:27 2015 UTC,"or enforce fairness between the various sites accessing the internet through the DC?   Exactly this. At the ASA on the outside interface to the Internet, we've throttled each site to a 80/40Mbit connection which works fine.  However we want to now apply QoS at each site to achieve exactly as you say, enforce fairness of this shaped Internet connection without affecting user <> dc traffic.  For example, we want to allow full Gigabit connectivity of say HTTP between user <> dc, but ensure fairness of HTTP between user <> Internet."
networking,3cyjk3,akirchhoff,3,Sun Jul 12 00:34:22 2015 UTC,"hierarchical QoS would be your friend in this case. link to docs   It can get pretty complex, but you can define a policy like this:  Parent Qos policy pseudo config:  Policy-map Outbound_from_SiteA      class DC_Traffic:          bandwidth 900Mbit   << This guarantees a minimum of 900Mbit to DC     class Internet_Traffic         shape 80Mbit   << Shapes traffic to internet to a max of 80Mbit   You can get very complex on your QoS policy, including sharing the internet bandwidth between the two sites. This would require remarking traffic to different DSCP markings based on the level of traffic passing through the router."
networking,3cyjk3,voodoo_bytecaster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:47:45 2015 UTC,Seconded this. You will just have to manually configure it at both sites. DC will have the group policy mappings and you just need your sites to specify the group mappings they want to be a part of. Can't remember the command off the top of my head.  You will also need to determine if you want to shape or just classify the traffic... drop conditions etc.
networking,3cyjk3,1701_Network,5,Sun Jul 12 17:56:16 2015 UTC,"Any shaping you do should be at the point of contention (200Mbps link).  No other link will be aware of congestion.  If you just want to provide ""fairness"" between the three sites I would guarantee 75 Mbps for each site (slight over subscription, will only be an issue if all three sites are talking but its up to you).  If this is Cisco you would do it with an MQC policy with the ""bandwidth"" statement.  This way 1 site won't throttle down to 100Mbps if there is another 100Mbps available.  If one site wants to use all 200Mbps and no other sites are using it then it gets all 200Mbps.  But if there is contention each site is guaranteed its fair share."
networking,3cyjk3,1701_Network,3,Sun Jul 12 01:14:14 2015 UTC,"So if we want to use something like Untangle for QoS, we're best putting an appliance between the ASA and the Internet connection and not at each site?"

I'm aware it doesn't add a lot of security to hide an ssid, we just don't like users to see ""Engineering Vlan"".   Do you actually believe wireless is any less secure than wired in this day and age!?!?   I'm actually of the belief it is MORE secure in most instances considering it would take a user a lot more effort to decrypt my encrypted connection through the air than it would for them to raise a ceiling tile and put a tap on my wired connection.   I've got an encrypted wireless connection authenticating with my secure credentials passing encrypted SSH traffic to my network devices. I really don't see the security issue there. If that's insecure we may as well just say managing your network from home over an SSL vpn is insecure because someone could crack the encryption in transit on the internet.  I understand the importance of security, we in the networking community as a whole really need to get over the whole ""Wired is more secured than wireless"" mentality. I would understand if some marketing guy or manager argued against its security but as an engineer you should know that speak of wireless insecurity in a well-managed full scale enterprise wireless deployment simply isn't true and it all stems from BS fear mongering that took place decades ago before the technology evolved."

networking,3ctmlf,suagrfix,0,Sat Jul 11 12:21:28 2015 UTC,"Not generally, we just try and impose a decent physical security policy to our buildings with a badge system.   I have worked on very few networks that actually use wired access control of any form. I have deployed 802.1x and MAB as a form on NAC in the past working for the DOD because of security requirements but it is very expensive, annoying to implement and hard to maintain for what it offers in my opinion. It's not like we have a dire need to keep people from accessing out internal network anyways. They couldn't do any damage without a privileged domain account and the registered key FOB/software anyways.  Even with NAC people can still easily sniff a wire that is already authenticated by a host if they want  I think there is a decent market for a form of encrypted NAC that doesn't kill performance and is easy to manage but when you're talking about certificate based authentication for network access control managing it per-host is pretty cumbersome. I've only ever worked with 802.1x, but I feel like the fact that it doesn't encrypt the wire makes it ultimately pretty useless."

networking,3cvgnz,GhostHoudini,8,Sat Jul 11 02:48:36 2015 UTC,"Best way to learn networking? Keep the passion for technology. There will be times where you're studying things you could care less about, to a level that you see no point to other than for an exam. One day one of those bits of information that stuck with you will pop back up to help you troubleshoot a problem. If you get burned out, step back and put some time into non-tech hobbies, it will help refresh your passion.    It looks like you have a good certification plan setup. I personally would move the CCENT up a bit, to make sure it's something you like. I'm passionate like yourself,  but not all aspects of IT are things that really catch my interest, so make sure networking is right for you. With a dev background, you'll do well with a command line which is basically your life in networking. Moving forward as things become more automated and scripted with the push to SDN, you'll have a head start.     I do full scope network engineering, from VOIP, Security, Lan/Wan, drinking whiskey, etc. It's a good field, and many people don't want to get into it because of the learning curve starting out. However that is to your advantage. I make somewhere between 80 - 120 k (I can't be specific in detail) and have my CCNP. Mon-Fri atmosphere doing projects and O&M, with an on call rotation for outages.    Once you hit your NA level, make sure you put some time in the trenches before jumping right into finishing your CCNP. Motivation is good, but employers don't want someone who only has book smarts.    For studying, if you can check out CBT nuggets or INE, they do a good job with most cisco cert studying. There's also good content for free around the web, and plenty on Youtube. Use GNS3 or Cisco Packet Tracer for your NA/NP studies and you'll do fine. You can invest in a lab if you'd like, but for the NA level at least virtual devices get the job done. Just understand that those icons on the screen are the equivalent to big pieces of hardware, so google image search them to understand what you're essentially working with.    Best of luck!  Edit: I run a blog at blamethenetwork dot com. I wouldn't say it's the best, but I have links to some of the other top talkers in the networking community, people who really are industry experts.

networking,3cvgnz,auriem,3,Sun Jul 12 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"Part of what I've done is read up on the protocols. I found understanding how the protocols work, not just how to use them, very useful in having a more complete understanding of networking. Some books I found useful for this are linked here. Some of these aren't the newest but that doesn't mean they aren't still great resources.  OSPF Anatomy Internet Routing Protocol  BGP4: Inter-Domain Routing in the Internet  MPLS-Enabled Applications  The other thing that's really going to be useful is experience. This isn't something you're just going to force feed yourself though, it's going to be gained over time and ingrained almost like muscle memory. Repeated use helps reinforce your knowledge and skills. Also accept you will not master everything. You seem to have already dove into a few different subjects, and that's great.  Honestly with your experience in programming if you can also get a good grasp of networking you could make a great addition to a company in helping with network automation. This is something that has been critical in scaling for Microsoft, Facebook, Google, etc. However certs aren't the most important thing here, knowledge is. Don't think of certifications as a goal, they are just some piece of paper that says you could pass the test.  Also consider Cisco's certifications might not help you when companies are increasingly looking at alternatives where hardware and software are decoupled. Some like Facebook and Google are writing their own operating systems for their switches to enjoy greater control and focus of scope. When you don't have 50 different knobs you don't need included in the program that's 50 different code paths you don't have bugs in. This doesn't mean they don't still use standard protocols, but they don't want to be limited by them. Again I think this means some experience in development could be a benefit to you,"

If you're wanting to test switch features that can't be done in GNS3, grab a decent (Intel PRO from my experience) network card that wont strip VLAN tags, and a cheap Catalyst switch, you can then connect it to your PC physically, and logically to a heap of routers in GNS3.  Depending on your home internet connection, I'd also consider grabbing a cheap Cisco 800 series off ebay and configure that up as your home router.

Personally I spread it out over time, but you could pull a 2811 or 2821/2851 for about $60, which if you've got any kind of decent internet connection you'll probably want at least a 2821. Supplement to your ""3 routers"" from that blog post with 26xx routers, specifically XMs or 2691s.  Switches, get at least one 3550, preferably two. If you see a really good deal on a 3560 grab one instead of a 3550; they don't need crossover cables and they can do Private VLAN and IPv6 L3 stuff. Fill out with 2950s as they're about $5-10 a pop plus shipping.  Poke around for access points but make sure whichever one you get you can upgrade to standalone mode; if not you'd need a controller which is probably out of your price range anytime soon.

I have the skill and resume experience however I don't have a clearance.   I've googled it a bit and from what I can tell an employer has to ""sponsor"" your Secret or TS clearance.  Any suggestions or advice?"
networking,3cq6ck,Sinnedangel8027,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:45:25 2015 UTC,"Secret is handed out like candy most times - look for jobs that need a secret clearance and most of them will give you an interm secret while they run a background check.    TS is where it becomes more difficult.  You need a company that is willing to put a lot of time in you waiting for the clearance process to go through.  Sometimes this is quick, sometimes, like in my case, it was 2 and a half years.    The company has to have a slot for you to work on during that time.    Start towards a secret with a contracting company, then look for their internal postings that require TS.  See if they will get it for you as you already work for them.    Just be prepared for an extensive background investigation.  Neighbors, employers, school friends, school professors, pretty much anyone you may have made contact with in the last 10 years is fair game.    Also be ready to get used.  IF you don't have the clearance and need one, you will likely find that the employer is going to take a huge chunk of the money they get paid and give you a tiny bit as you don't have much leverage until you've actually been granted the clearance.    The jobs during these phase generally suck and are low end (with exceptions).  Once you got it, usually not too bad then."

Not familiar with the situation in the U.S but generally it is:   Does this person have any criminal record etc? Do they use or have used drugs (and also will they admit to it)? Are they hiding anything that could get them blackmailed? i.e if someone has bad credit that could be a warning but if they have a good reason that is fine. If they say they racked up gamblings debts bye bye. Does everything they said match what we found when we did a rubber glove 10 year search of their history, friends and work colleges?   It also used to be a big thing if you were gay because it could be used against you. These day's they can't discriminate but i have heard you pretty much need to be completely out i.e you can't be gay and not have your grandma not know it (blackmail vector).  Then if you are state side they sit you on the most wonderful invention in medical quackery, The Polygraph. NSA in particular like to ask things like ""are you in to bestiality"" and things to get a rise out of you. It's pretty traumatic for some people.

Apply to some gigs and get a secret. Large infrastructure companies (FiberPlus and the like) will let you work uncleared and escorted while they work on your TS/SCI.  Once you get the golden ticket,  you leave for a real job.    If that doesn't sound good,  just apply for cleared gigs and with a little luck,  you can get one.

As someone else pointed out, generally people only post reviews online when they're pissed off, so take everything there with a grain of salt.  This applies with all online reviews, not just Glassdoor.  That in mind, gov't contracting jobs these days are really rough in general.  Contract competitiveness has driven salaries down to the point where even cleared jobs are often getting paid less than market rate.  This has resulted in a real talent drain as senior-level engineers are leaving in droves and even senior slots are being filled with guys fresh out of the military or ITT tech with no idea what they're actually doing.  The days of money falling from the skies for IT contractors are rapidly coming to a close.  There will eventually be a shakeup and a correction, but that's still a few years off.  It's also worth pointing out that as an on-site contractor, your day-to-day job happiness is going to be a lot more influenced by the climate of the agency you're actually working for than any of the politics at your company.  Except in a few rare circumstances, your only interaction with your company management will be the occasional phone call with the boss and filling out your timesheet.

Actual examples:   y1731 returns accurate results in both synthetic and non synthetic modes on switch by vendor $x. Four other equivlant switches by other vendors fail to do this.  Vendors X and Y both claim their switch can withstand certain temperature extremes. However when lab tested, only one of them remained functional.  Vendor Z can double pop vlan tags. Vendor X can not.   Vendor Y's QoS implementation is capable of being configured to emulate ""short pipe"" using QinQ, vendor C's fails to insert frames into the correct queues. Vendor Y has eight hardware queues, C also has eight, but Y can only strict priority queue on two of them (grrrrr).  I could go on for years. If you're just doing simple switching don't worry about it. Oh and some of them crash, ie. software bugs, with certain features, or drop frames of certain traffic types sent specific ways."

Junos is god, all else is shit.   Would it be better to say that the differences would be more apparent if I was trying to do fun and funky things with the boxes?   Probably. It comes down to your requirements. Don't drop thousands of dollars on flashy switches if you're just going to plug them in and never touch the management interface. I have this happen all the time, people who want the ""best"" but balk at my recommendation to actually configure the features on it because of ""complexity"" or because they don't understand how some issue bit them once and disabling an unrelated or tangentially related feature ""fixed"" the problem.  Generally, you're going to just have classes of switches, and different vendors will make comparable products in each class. The selling point is absolutely the software capabilities, very rarely the hardware (unless you're pushing big data and care whether your big-expensive-router is going to be ASIC-limiting single 40Gig flows). So people tend to buy things they're familiar with, or once they've gotten some exposure to different CLI syntax, they buy Juniper what they like best. The differences in feature set for low-end stuff is going to be small, but you may like or prefer the way one vendor does things over another.

Yes, there are minor variations: an extra few gigs of backplane here   You should pay attention to that one, because it immediately tells you something about the ports.   These switches are all able to switch traffic between all ports at line rate, so they have the forwarding capacity (backplane isn't the right word here) to match. If one suddenly has a larger forwarding capacity, then that one has more ports. The EX2200 is a good example: it's listed as a 48-port switch, but it's actually a 52-port switch because the SFP ports aren't shared. This is quite unlike the Avaya 3500 for instance which has two dual-personality ports."

networking,3cscdy,Braambes,13,Fri Jul 10 11:18:34 2015 UTC,Once you're above 10 or 30 clients you typically start looking at using VLANs for segmentation.  The driver is usually security but also performance and scaling.  Example:  If you put wired and wireless systems on the same VLAN all that broadcast traffic from wired systems ends up sucking up air time over wireless for no reason which means slower wireless (unless you have a setup that can filter broadcast traffic).  So we end up with one VLAN for wired clients and one for wireless.  Now we have servers which we want to restrict access to even from internal connections to only what is needed because the majority of attacks depend on a user doing something stupid and using their PC as a pivot point to reach the internal network.  So we create a server VLAN.  We host servers that get external connections and have a higher risk of being compromised so we don't want them to have unrestricted access to the rest of the network so we create a VLAN for our DMZ.  Now we have all these printers.  Wow printers suck.  They have everything wide open just waiting to be compromised and the new copier has a damn hard drive that keeps copies of everything printed.  Fuck that printer.  Well we want to isolate the printer from clients.  We could put it on the server network but we don't want the server network going around the whole building and creating a firewall rule for each printer would suck.  So we'll just create a printer VLAN that has a few rules that apply to everything on it.  Oh crap.  We migrated to VoIP because its cheaper but the call quality sucks whenever Steve is torrenting.  I hate steve but he's the CEO so I can't say shit.  OK well I guess I need to implement Quality of Service on my switches and router.  Now I have a dedicated VLAN for voice.  We need to start locking down web access over wireless for security reasons.  We can't have people going anywhere they want and getting infected with malware.  So we get OpenDNS and roll out wireless encryption.  But now people are complaining that they can't check their personal email.  So we create a 2nd wireless network (yep another VLAN) for BYOD which is completely isolated from the business network so people can jump on things like Facebook and Tindr with their phones and everyone is happy.  Now we're up to ~ 7 VLANs.  If you have things like electronic door locks or security cameras or HVAC controls those all get their own VLAN for the same reason printers do.  So you could go up to 10+ easily.  This is typical for a business with < 50 people (assuming they invest and depend upon technology for the business).  Once you start growing bigger you start wanting VLANs to split up different departments from one another.  You might not trust support to be on the same VLAN as the CEO for example.  If you start getting a lot of servers then you might introduce things like a storage VLAN for network storage and a management VLAN for out-of-band or lights out server management.  It's not uncommon for companies in the 100-500 client range make use of 30 or so VLANs.  Bigger than this VLANs start becoming something you need for scale.  You really don't want more than 400-500 hosts sharing a VLAN because of all the broadcast traffic.  So if you're running a business with thousands of people you could be looking at a hundred VLANs.
networking,3cscdy,soucy,4,Fri Jul 10 12:09:01 2015 UTC,Typically VLANS make security easier.  For instnace:  VLAN10: Wired Users VLAN20: WiFi Users VLAN30: Internal Servers VLAN40: Servers that need to be publicly reachable   It tends makes ACLs and zone based security much easier.
networking,3cscdy,jetter23,2,Fri Jul 10 11:26:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Also some devices just need to be separated - IP phones should be on their own VLAN, as well as wireless access points, and wireless clients.  I tend to use: - network management - wireless access points - servers & printers - wired PCs - internal wireless devices - guest wireless devices - IP phones - DMZ (if used)    It's also common to split up servers or clients based on roles, location, department or required access, and it's not as hard as it seems to do.  VLANs alone are not completely secure, but it adds a layer to the ""defence in depth"" concept and used with other networking technologies helps create a highly secure and easy to manage environment."

'user' was a full domain admin.  They demanded it be this way because their staff couldn't be bothered to type their own username or have to remember another password.  They also wanted to make sure any of the users could install any software they needed on any machine, as well as remote into the servers to look at why things weren't working.

Heck, in 2011, one of our clients still had a hub in place and wouldn't let us replace it ...  There wasn't any voice traffic, they still used analog phones.

A SOHO might need a router with a WAN-port and LAN-switch while a small to midsize office will have servers and all kinds of doohickeys. This is when VLAN:s become really useful.  I, myself, always have at least two VLAN:s configured in every scenario: WAN and LAN. This enables me to have one cable from the media converter (modem) to the switch and one to the router (from the switch), less cables is always good.

networking,3cscdy,asdlkf,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"The point of a vlan is 2 fold:  1) it groups devices together to make smaller broadcast domains, which improve performance. Each broadcast on a network must be processed (computationally) by every computer on the vlan, to determine if the packet is relavent to the machine. More/smaller vlans = less work processing broadcast packets.  2) security divisions. If you want to use a firewall between your clients and servers (or between clients and other clients, or between anything and anything else), they have to be in different subnets which generally implies separate vlans. You can have them on different switches, but this is functionally IDENTICAL to having them on different vlans, except one costs 0 and the other costs the dollar value of having a 2nd switch.  So, if you want scalability/performance or if you have security requirements, you need vlans."

In the simplest terms, a VPN will encrypt the traffic between your network and another network.  If you're worried about being DoS'd, then no, it won't help you any.  If you're worried about your traffic being sniffed, a VPN will protect the communication between the two VPN endpoints.  ""Anonymous VPN"" services will keep your traffic safe while inside the VPN... after it leaves their end and goes out to the public internet, it will be sent in the clear as normal, but of course it will be using their routable/public IP address."

Options:   Find a VPN service that lets you choose from multiple locations, and switch between them. (AirVPN is one that I use, but there are many.) Not sure any of them will have as many as 134 locations, so you might have to use multiple. Use TOR, switch between exit nodes. Have a bunch of people do it from their phones and from their home computers. This one's a long shot, but does the site support IPv6? If it does, and you have IPv6 connectivity at work (or can set up a tunnel), then you have effectively unlimited v6 addresses and can switch between them. But only a small minority of sites have v6 so it's not super likely.   Unfortunately the all of these are pretty labor intensive.

In the real interview, we don't give a shit about certifications - we will know inside of 15 minutes if you know and care about the kind of work we're looking to hire for.  I have a handful of stupid certifications (Don't get me started on ITIL), just enough to know that they're mostly bullshit and that I won't ever hire anyone based upon them."

networking,3crph4,Rudd-X,-3,Fri Jul 10 12:07:31 2015 UTC,"The time you spend in getting credentials is time you could spend actually learning things that people would pay you money for, or working and getting paid.  Credentials are only useful in fields where you can't find a job without them, because they are legally required or something like that.  For example, many areas in the United States require you to have credentials to braid hair.  The computing sector is most decidedly not one of those fields.  My wife isn't even a college graduate, yet she makes six figures plus bonus and stock, creating and maintaining software at a company whose services you use daily.  She has no credentials whatsoever -- all she had was her experience, which wasn't even that extensive.  I have no credentials other than my bachelor's degree.  I work at the same company, get paid the same molehill of cash.  I've interviewed people at many workplaces too.  Never bothered getting anything like a CCNA, LPI, MCSE, et cetera.  Waste of time.  The only workplaces where my wife and I have interviewed that asked either of us about having those credentials were dumpy workplaces full of mediocre people.  None of the places either my wife or I have actually worked for even bothered asking for these credentials before interviewing us onsite or hiring us, much less turned any of us down for not having them.   The reality of the workplace that expects you to have credentials makes me suspect credentialism and mediocrity may be related -- I mean, if you are a mediocre engineer (not saying you are), a cardboard rectangle may help you look better than the other mediocre engineers.  If you or anyone else wants to get credentials, go right ahead and spend that time and money -- it's your resources at stake.  Just make sure not to fall into the credentialist illusion that, because you have these credentials, you'll be more likely to be hired in the computing industry.  Here is the truth: none of those cardboard rectangles will make you ace an onsite interview, and those of us who interview people as part of our job don't care about them.  Why is that?  Because the kind of knowledge that the credential shows you learned is usually ""how to use product X version Y"", which usually becomes obsolete very fast.  When I interview you, I am not going to ask you what command you type in your Cisco ASA session in order to enable NAT for a particular IP range, because I expect you to look that kind of thing up.  I will ask you to describe and implement NAT in a fictional router on my whiteboard instead, because that will show me whether you understand the fundamental theoretical knowledge from which every practical detail can be deduced."
networking,3crph4,heinekev,3,Fri Jul 10 19:41:14 2015 UTC,"I just... man.  Why would anyone advise against certifications?  I don't get it.    Honestly -- and I will get attacked for this no doubt -- but I'll go ahead and say it:  if you think that certification study material is not a valid place to learn things that people will actually pay money for, then you either have never opened a CCNA/CCNP book or your study habits are terrible and you look at reading them as a chore to be done and not a source of knowledge.  The required reading and labs for most industry standard certifications are valuable.  They do teach you applicable skills.  The certification at the end is just a tollgate.    I hear you.  You need experience.  Blah blah blah.  Certifications are the gateway to experience.  Reading that material counts as experience.  Cheating through that material is a different story.  But legitimately reading the material, doing the labs?  How can you EVER discount that?    And, above all of that, you're insinuating that someone is wasting their time by going after certification.  That is patently false, ESPECIALLY if you are new to the industry.    ""The time you spend in getting credentials is time you could spend actually learning things that people would pay you money for, or working and getting paid.""  What?  Exactly what are you talking about.  Describe a scenario where you can ""actually learn something that someone would pay you money for"" that isn't also relevant to a recognized certification?  Your main point being that ""knowledge is more valuable than a certification card"" is correct, but you're ignoring the fact that if you're properly follow the fucking course work, you will be gaining knowledge.    This silly elitist mentality that certifications do not cover relevant valid material needs to end.   IT is highly competitive.  It's one of the rare fields where you can make six figure salaries without a traditional degree.  And that means you'll be competing against a lot of people.  ANYTHING you can do to elevate yourself above the pack is something worth investing time in.  End of discussion."
networking,3crph4,Rudd-X,-3,Fri Jul 10 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"I just... man. Why would anyone advise against certifications? I don't get it.     Time spent doing that may be spent more productively on other endeavors. Not everybody learns well in the same learning setting.  Some people learn much better, faster and more durably by doing than by studying. Your credentials don't prove to me that you are worth hiring. Credentialism is in fact associated with mediocrity.  When you can prove what you do by doing instead of by showing papers -- this is the purpose of onsite interviews -- your credibility is that much better because that cannot be faked.    I hear you. You need experience. Blah blah blah. Certifications are the gateway to experience. Reading that material counts as experience.   That's exactly upside-down wrong.  Professional experience is professional experience, of actual work done that someone appreciated enough to pay you for it.  Six months of work experience > six months of certifications study.  Certifications do not show anyone that you have any experience in anything other than sitting down and reading books, which is a privilege you pay for, that doesn't necessarily prove you are worth paying to.  Let me be a bit more blunt.  I am your interviewer, and I say ""reading material"" doesn't count as professional experience.  Since I get to decide whether you get hired or not, I am de facto right and you are de facto wrong.  I am honestly not saying this to be an asshole to you -- I am sure you are a brilliant and kind person -- I am merely trying to disabuse you of the incorrect belief that interviewers and businesses care whether you've read a lot or not.  We care whether you can solve problems for us, and that's exactly what we try to figure out when we bring you in for an onsite interview.   But legitimately reading the material, doing the labs? How can you EVER discount that?    I don't discount that.  It's just that the activity you're bringing up as virtuous is simply not that big of a deal.  Wherever I've worked at, it's a given that you're expected to be able to effectively whiz through material you've never seen before -- code, playbooks, manuals, documentation, man pages, et cetera -- and use that material to be productive, at an information use maturity level of critical or creative (see page 32 of that paper).  In contrast, coursework and material is mostly reproductive and transferential.  Thus, displaying a paper (credential) that shows us you can read lots of material and do lots of coursework doesn't prove that you're worth the money we would be paying.  At best, it proves that you have a high boredom threshold and your memory is prodigious, which are nice-to-haves in any employee, but isn't really proof that you can do the work you want to be paid to do.  (The research I just linked to was created by a former university teacher of mine.  Brilliant man.  But he isn't always right -- he didn't consider me to be a great student.  That's okay, because his opinion didn't end up mattering that much.  Ten years later, I'm working at an elite multinational business, and he's still stuck in academia.)   IT is highly competitive. It's one of the rare fields where you can make six figure salaries without a traditional degree. And that means you'll be competing against a lot of people. ANYTHING you can do to elevate yourself above the pack is something worth investing time in.   You and I absolutely agree on this.  The problem -- where we disagree -- is that you believe that burning time and money in getting papers  is going to distinguish you from the pack more effectively than spending equal amounts of time actually working, which nets you actual professional experience and money.  What I'm trying to tell you is that this belief is false.  Only mediocre interviewers and employers are fooled by papers.  No one at elite workplaces will be fooled by them.  Thus, every minute of your limited lifetime you spend actually working and learning by doing is a solid investment in a practical education of actual problem solving, that will increase your chance into those elite workplaces.  Trust me on this: if what you want to be is an employee, you want to work at an elite workplace, because that improves your career prospects dramatically.  1 year of studying for certifications plus 2 years at Podunk Soft Inc, OH, looks like a badge of shame on your resume, when compared to 3 years at LinkedIn or Facebook.  Optimizing your time towards collecting all those Pokemon certs that Podunk Soft will demand from you is a foolish career move.  I know this because I interview people onsite as part of my job description at an elite company.  Trust me when I say this: none of us interviewers are impressed by papers.  All we care is whether you can do the job, and no paper is going to tell me that.   This silly elitist mentality that certifications do not cover relevant valid material needs to end.    This isn't a class war issue, bud.  The issue with certifications isn't that they ""do not cover relevant valid material"" either.  They often do -- it's just that they don't actually prove you can do the work.  ""Guy that looks good on paper"" is a thing -- we see properly-credentialed people crash and burn during their onsite interviews all the time.   Whether you can do the work exactly what we want to know, when we sit down with you for five hours and ask you tough questions.

What IS relevant is that you learn, and certification study done properly is INDEED learning   That's exactly upside-down wrong. Professional experience is professional experience, of actual work done that someone appreciated enough to pay you for it. Six months of experience > six months of study. Certifications do not show anyone that you have any experience in anything other than sitting down and reading books, which is a privilege you pay for, that doesn't necessarily prove you are worth paying to.   I'm a newbie to IT thinking about getting certified.  What work can I do, and how will it benefit me more than a structured curriculum?  If you are serious about your career, your first six months of experience will coincide with six months of study.  No engineer in this industry remains relevant without CONSTANT STUDY THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE CAREER.   In addition, without credentials, how is a newbie going to get professional experience?  Working off of a command script in a NOC?  Right.  Because that is relevant.    Building a linux box on consumer equipment is not really valid experience nor will it get you through an interview.  Building a Windows domain is not really valid experience if you don't understand what you're doing and why you need to do it.

All we care is whether you can do the job, and no paper is going to tell me that.   What ""actual work"" should someone do in lieu of studying certification material?  Learn by doing only goes so far.  You have to have an idea of what you want to do and where you start doing that, and certifications provide a valuable guided path to earning that.  A systems engineer that dives straight into deploying active directory is probably going to end up successful but will have deviated far from best practices and probably still would fail an interview.  Reading the MCSE material and following through their lab will prepare someone better than ""just doing it.""    Network engineers that don't crack any study material and go out to deploy a router might successfully turn up the circuit.  But when the next engineer logs into that router and finds telnet enabled on the outside interface, did the first guy really learn anything?  If you're serious about your career, studying and staying up to date is never a waste of time.    I am also responsible for interviewing at my current organization as well as my past.  I'm not interested in comparing dick sizes, but your sweeping statements here are wildly inaccurate.   If you bring in a CCNA candidate with no experience and expect them to ace a senior level interview, your expectations are incorrect.  Certification is not a replacement for experience, but it facilitates relevant learning.    No one is ""fooled"" by a certification paper.  But what it tells me when I see a candidate who has 5 years of experience and a CCNP is that I have someone who is interested enough in their field to self improve.  Does it immediately mean I am going to trust this guy with my critical edge routing without an interview?  No, but that's exactly what the interview is for:  vetting that shit out.  If your organization is hiring ""paper certified"" candidates, then I would argue they are failing as an interviewer.    Putting myself in the candidates shoes and ""learning by working"" without a curriculum / lesson plan / goal, I may be able to build a working OSPF topology but I will likely not have the depth required to pass that interview if I didn't have context on what I needed to get out of my ""work experience"" setting up OSPF.    Certification guides or class curriculum provides that missing context.  And with regards to your ""I know this because I interview people for an elite company"":  I currently work at an elite workplace.  I have worked at other elite workplaces.  None of them suffered from this mythical ""well he has the papers lets give him the keys"" mentality that anti-certification people seem to perpetuate.  Maybe I've been lucky.  The papers help you get the interview, and if you learned what you were supposed to learn during the process of earning that paper, it will benefit you in your interview.    Your entire argument is that learning by working is more efficient than following certification curriculum, but that's not black and white as you're portraying it.  Certification programs provide context, guidelines, and online support communities to help enable a thorough and solid understanding of the subject matter.  It is not a waste of time.  Nowhere have I said it is a replacement for experience.  But how do you get experience?  By being realistic with yourself, genuinely following the curriculum, and applying for a junior role.    And if you're referring to senior engineers firmly established in their careers, that engineer should already know what works for them and where they want to go -- as well as how to get there.  I'm not going to interview a CCNP candidate with only NOC experience and expect them to be well versed in vxlan or mpls.  And likewise, as a senior engineer, I'm not going to go into an interview for an ISP architecture role without being absolutely sure I'm versed on ISP topologies, technologies, and challenges.  That's common sense and has nothing to do with whether or not certification is relevant."

If your only goal is the card at the end, then you are a ""paper <insert cert here>"" and have not made a solid effort to learn.

This morning had an appointment with our partner vendor asking to set up a site to site to give them access to our server for some financial analysis, and I did. Two weeks ago when I was out at one of the clinics they came in and the IT Director left the business card on my desk to set them up with a site to site and ""give them access to the server"". Since I am the Network Administrator anyways.  Well from talking to them they needed access to a couple of servers one was onsite and another one was at a complete different vendor, but since they don't have a contract with them and with the hospital, we had to set them up with a PC on our network, so that's where he came in. IT Director asked for him to create a PC in VM and provide me with an address, well what he did was basically added the IP address of the PC to the remote Network in the firewall, without talking to the other end thinking thats all he had to do. So that basically gives you a whole idea of whats going on."

From there, you will want to configure the rest of the network ports as iSCSI. You will most likely want to use a (single) separate subnet and VLAN for your iSCSI ports.   If there is no local storage on the servers, you will need to boot from iSCSI. If there is, you will install VMware ESXi, assign it a Management IP address (same subnet as the NAS), then log into the system remotely.   This is how you will want to configure the iSCSI ports in VMware (if not booting from iSCSI): http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/vmware-multipathing-configuration-software-iSCSI-port-binding.pdf  On the VMware side of things, you will want to split out available ports the following subnets:  Management (Access to VM Hosts)  vMotion (moves VMs between VM Hosts)  iSCSI  VM network (VM Guest access to network)  I like to assign two ports for Management & vMotion, using one port as active, and one as failover.

So, now I'm waiting for that feature to be added before I can deploy any of them.  EDIT: also, when configuring them I got confused about they way they handle VLANs. Unlike every other switch in existence with a web interface, you don't have a table of ports where you can select which VLANs are Tagged and Untagged. Even their other switches like the ToughSwitch have this. Instead, you have to build templates based on the VLAN setups in your UniFi controller. Then apply a template to each port.

networking,3cnekk,something_amusing,3,Thu Jul 9 13:19:16 2015 UTC,"Same basic gist. On other Ubiquiti devices you assign the IP address of the device and the management VLAN separately. Marking one as the management VLAN just tells it which VLAN that IP should belong to. Makes it work well with my Dell switches which are setup pretty much like Cisco gear. I have some of their small ToughSwitches and PtP wireless devices setup this way.  Depending on your setup, it might not matter. Whichever untagged VLAN you have set as the PVID is the management VLAN on these UniFi switches. So if your management network happens to be untagged, it can work. But for my install, we have fiber trunks carrying all traffic as tagged to our remote buildings on the campus. So, since my management traffic is tagged, I can't remotely access the management interface."

The best and worst job I ever worked was at an MSP. It's stressful, but you gain so much experience. I learned more in my first year at an MSP than most people learn in 4 years at a college in terms of applicable job training. Since you deal with so many different clients and technologies you learn alot not only about knowledge, but about what you like working with. I took on all the tasks I could take in the company and did things from automation to desktop deployment to networking on premise and in data centers. I tried out every role I could in the company and it let me figure out what and who I like working with. After 3 years there a company came along and gave me a job offer for almost twice what I was making at the MSP...it's an easy sell..I made sure I was a good cultural fit and that the people were good to work with...then I walk in with examples of work and I get to tell them that I was part of a 3 person team that supported 50 companies and 1,200 endpoints with businesses ranging from small 10 person companies to 200+ multi location companies...you gain the experience necessary to help businesses grow as an internal resource.   Or you may even like working at an MSP! Many people don't want to be tied down to the same equipment and people and I get that too. At an MSP you'll rarely work on the same issues each day.  If you can't find an MSP to intern at, try freelancing for a bit. Earn atleast the A+ and look at the freelance gig craigslist section. Be upfront with where you are and work at a lower rate than they post.   If you want to learn hardware experience there are companies that have the contract for HP warranty repairs and all they require is an A+, they also constantly post on craigslist.

networking,3cnyc0,TheElfkin,2,Thu Jul 9 11:27:08 2015 UTC,"not sure if this counts, but you can put a couple different line cards in the ZL series HP switches (such as a 5406).  For example, J9858A is basically a VMWare server in a line card.   http://www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/getpdf.aspx/c04315134.pdf?ver=1  The line card is basically an SSD, a processor, some RAM, a 1Gbps management port, and 2x 10Gbps network ports connected to the switch backplane.  This will give you 20Gbps full duplex inter-vlan routing within the switch, and you can put whatever 10G interfaces you want into the switch.   The line card is about $5500, and a 5406 with 8x 10G ports is another $10k."

Some folks flat out said to me that they want NAT/ACL on the switch to reduce cost, but there was no driving use-case behind it. My suggestion like others is to look at a decent 10G switch and do NAT/ACL's on a firewall. Also, remember to ask your switch vendor - what kind of ACL's these are - stateful or stateless ?"

From today on another 500 Pockethernet devices are on sale - these are the few ones left from the first production batch (the second production run is expected in November.)  I really appreciate your ongoing support and a fair amount of you wanted to have additional devices immediately so the Indiegogo-Backers have priority: you have the weekend to purchase another Pockethernet now! All other registered interested will be notified on Tuesday.  The feedback from all of you was great, both praise and suggestions for improvement. However, the financial result of the crowdfunding campaign didn't allow for any growth in sense of hirings, so things have moved a bit slowly. By now the two most important issues have been fixed: - TDR is now more accurate: It now uses a new algorithm, that uses different pulse widths for shorter and longer cables - The DHCP re-request bug, where the device didn't acquire a new IP address on a new connection - The software update utility is in preparation that enables upgrades the firmware of the devices via USB - A new manual with usage examples and detailed explanations  With these modifications Pockethernet should be better than ever, so hurry up while stock lasts!  The shipment of these devices and the release of the new firmware and update utility will be in the 1st week of August. You can place your orders here: https://pockethernet.com/store/1/pockethernet  Also, based on your feedback, development work continues with these items in this order: - MAC and IP address display of the DHCP server - BER test: continous testing, more samples and higher resolution - CDP and LLDP support - CSV and JSON export of the measurements - Graphical TDR display - VLAN support  The second production series and the associated App- and Software-updates can be expected this autumn. The next purchase round/possibility will follow around November - with all the new features.  Happy Ethernet measurements!  Cheers, Zoltan"

SimpleHelp remote services installed on remote computers receive no response on SimpleHelp server (as they normally do) hosted at ""home"" location -This is an installed remote management suite for techs. I recommend it btw. About 100 other computers via many locations still contact the SimpleHelp server with no issues. Other services such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, ICMP all timeout to/from both locations as well. No other sites/services are affected AFAIK (i've tried many with no issue) at both sites.   I did talk to the WISP guy today and sent him several screenshots of those tests. He had a lot to say, but my poor Spanish fluency only allowed me to understand about half of what he said.

networking,3cnbpp,DexTsarII,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"Ok so if I understand this correct, you got a rdp application running on every PC in the remote office, which connect to the server at Home location.

Or you just NATing that RDP application ports at Home location to the server?"
networking,3cnbpp,DexTsarII,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:55:52 2015 UTC,"Correct, and no tunneling or mpls. Just NAT at both locations for the RDP and VNC. But the SimpleHelp remote service uses HTTP and HTTPS  Edited:"

I would check to see if those NAT translation are generating when you initiate a https session. If it's a firewall, do a packet capture and try to see if those packets are reaching outside interface of the firewall. I really don't think it's an ISP issue to be honest with you."
networking,3cnbpp,DanSheps,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:00 2015 UTC,Did you see my updated comment about the second location using the same WISP having the same issue? Those two offices are very close to each other and neither can connect to Home location and vice versa. And this happened at the same time. It's only these two places with the issue and they use the same local Wireless ISP. It's a fairly new WISP too.  I can try wireshark; that's a good idea.
networking,3cnbpp,DanSheps,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:46:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm...I mean there is only one way to definitely know whether those packets arrive at main office.

networking,3cnbpp,Heimdul,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:04:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the two traceroutes look like the traffic is getting to your border firewall.  Did something change on either of the firewalls that would block the traffic?  What ports do you have forwarded?  Are there any null routes anywhere (uRPF)?  Does the office work from a different location (not your home, for example a library)?"
networking,3cnbpp,Apachez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"No, nothing changed at all on our premises. I've even tried swapping out routers for giggles. The services I mentioned in the edited OP are forwarded at the office. The other services coming into the Home location run over HTTP (simplehelp software). I've enabled ping response on my router and still can't even get that ICMP packet through.  There's nothing out of the ordinary of  these two simple NAT'd networks (everything else also works). Timewarner and the WISP said their equipment does not blacklist anything, but I can prove that otherwise by pinging my gateway with a fat packet (even if its just a 15 min ban). If I don't get anywhere by tonight or tomorrow night, I'll leave my modem unplugged and hopefully get a new IP address (Home ISP is DHCP by Timewarner). This may or may not accomplish anything.  Yes, both locations have no other issues with any other site, service, destination, etc.  The WISP guy said he could see my website at Home location from their network. And shoot, I forgot to mention, there's a second office that uses the same WISP that also does not have connectivity to the Home location. So there's that.  Thanks for your suggestions"
networking,3cnbpp,DexTsarII,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it looks like the packets reach your firewall, or at least the first hop...  What does a traceroute from another location to your home get you?  What about that same location to the office(s)?"
networking,3cnbpp,Apachez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:21:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure that the traffic is reaching his firewall. On the trace from home, 2nd hop (first displayed) is likely his ISP's router, so his ISP is using that 10.x... IP in some of their routers.  On the trace back to home, traffic drops at point where next hop would likely be that 10.x router.  OP: Can you try trace from some location which works? That would allow you to see how last few hops go."
networking,3cnbpp,IDA_noob,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:44:17 2015 UTC,The most likely cause is that there's some issue on 173.209.68.109 or .110 to the next hop (which shows private IP address on trace from home). Unfortunately Smartcom who owns those addresses does not seem to provide Looking Glass.  You could try TW's LG to see the AS path to your IP and if their router can ping you.
networking,3cnbpp,DexTsarII,-1,Thu Jul 9 07:58:49 2015 UTC,"Get a laptop, download kali linux and burn on a dvd and boot from that.  Use that to verify that you can:  1) Ping the default gateway you get from ISP.  2) If their gateway doesnt reply to pings then check your arp table if you get to know which mac address their gateway uses.  3) Ping something you know should reply to pings such as ping.sunet.se  4) Do a traceroute to the same host (like towards ping.sunet.se) and compare the results.  5) Now do a traceroute from office connection to home ip, and from home connection to office ip and compare.  Note that just because you get * * * in your traceroute result doesnt necessary mean that something is broken - just that that host or something in between filters icmp. Check that slide from NANOG on how to interpret a traceroute. Also while you are at it traceroute with both UDP, TCP and ICMP.  6) And finally (since you run kali) start openssh on it and from each direction (home -> office, office -> home) try to connect to the <ipaddress>:22 using telnet, you should see a SSH header coming back.  If the above works you know that there is nothing wrong with the internet itself between home and office but rather something else either at home and/or at the office (bad firewall rules, bad malware, bad admin etc).  Point 3 above should tell you which connection is broken. In case ICMP is being blocked you could try to:  telnet www.gmail.com 465  and you should get something like this in reply (your ip will vary):  Trying 74.125.232.118... Connected to googlemail.l.google.com. Escape character is '^]'."
networking,3cnbpp,Apachez,3,Thu Jul 9 06:41:49 2015 UTC,Why use Kali Linux? All above steps can be done with regular windows...
networking,3cnbpp,DexTsarII,-10,Thu Jul 9 18:05:35 2015 UTC,"Because Kali Linux wont happily execute any shit thats being thrown at it over the internet, but also because with a single disc you will ALWAYS start from a known good image.  Your ""regular windows"" will degrade over time and you cant be sure if you have a situation like OP described if its your fault or fault with the link itself (well ISP).  So if you rule out errors on your side (by for example boot from a Kali Linux image) you can continue to investigate errors on the ISP side."

It gets worse if there's wi-fi connected and no VLANs in place.  Realistically, you're not likely to pull card data with just a CAM attack, but it might be enough to scare the boss into fixing the issues.  On the other hand, it's a gas station.

If their link out of the station is down then the pumps will go into a store forward mode and give $50 credit to any card that is scanned. This means two things.   If someone wants more than $50 of gas they will have to make multiple transactions. People will not want to deal with that hassle. If someone has a card with less than $50  and they scan then they will get gas. Later when the link is up the company will find out they just gave away free gas.

So, if a router has an interface 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.128 (/25)  It will probably advertise a route to 192.168.30.0/24 instead of 192.168.30.0/25, if the routing protocol has autosummary enabled.   This can be problematic if 192.168.30.128/25 is in use somewhere else in your network.   Note that because 192.168.0.0 is class C, the autosummary will be to the /24 boundary.  If you had a router with 10.0.0.1/25, it would auto summarize at 10.0.0.0/8, because 10.0.0.1 is a class A address.   Now, once you know that Class A is 1.0.0.0-126.255.255.255, Class B is 128.0.0.0-191.255.255.255, and Class C is 192.0.0.0-223.255.255.255, never use classful logic again, outside of cisco exams."

networking,3cm3v9,Apachez,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"1) Either you ""hide"" these dns resolvers behind some kind of loadbalancer (F5, A10, Kemp or whatever floats your boat) and/or you start using anycast so the network will decide which server the client ends up at.  2) Depends on the client. Some will randomize which server will get the first query (and if no answer then try the other server), some will just do roundrobin (first you ask ns1, the next question goes first to ns2, the question after that back to ns1 and so on) and some will query in the order you put in the servers (so ns1 will get >90% of the queries from this particular client).  3) How you mean? Like for domain example1.com you got ns1 as master and ns2 as slave while for example2.com you got ns2 as master and ns1 as slave?  Sure, why not? But often (to keep things simple and easy to maintain) you have a dedicated set of master server(s) who then replicates into the slaves. For larger environments you can also have a hidden master which the clients never can reach.  Other options is to use a multimaster environment - that is you dont send any updates on the wire between the dns-processes, you propagate the zonefiles through sftp or such instead and HUP the dns-process once new data is available."
networking,3cm3v9,Apachez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:06:52 2015 UTC,"2) Depends on the client. Some will randomize which server will get the first query (and if no answer then try the other server), some will just do roundrobin (first you ask ns1, the next question goes first to ns2, the question after that back to ns1 and so on) and some will query in the order you put in the servers (so ns1 will get >90% of the queries from this particular client).   So let's say the client have both servers configure and always picks up the first one, which happens to be the master 1.1.1.1.  All queries will be resolved by THAT name server and the second one will never be used. So the NS record for ""ns2"" is never really use, correct?  Unless you force the whatever application is using DNS to use the slave server like: ""dig host.example.com @ns2.example.com"". Which in this case it would use ""ns1"" to resolve ""ns2.example.com"" and then use that IP to conduct the original query. Am I correct?  To add to this: what's the actual difference of adding the NS record for the slave name server? If I add it, then I explicitly say the slave server (ns2) is authoritative for that example.com domain. If I don't, is still get authoritative answers because the slave got the information from the master... what's the correct approach?   And thanks for taking the time to response!"
networking,3cm3v9,daschu117,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:15:06 2015 UTC,"The correct approach is to define within your zone which servers are authoritive for this particular zone.  An authoritive server is a server who ""owns"" the zone and you can (lets leave out dnssec etc for now) know that this is a correct answer.  A resolver is someone who just cached the data and the data could be wrong (but TTL's will tell for how long the zone owner thinks the answer is still valid - you can put TTL for the whole zone or just particular entries like 1 hour default and 5min for ""www.example.com"").  If you leave out the ns2 part of your zone then whoever asks your authoritive servers will only know that ns1 is authoritive and noone else.  Also even if you got stupid clients who doesnt even out which resolver they query its a good advice to have at least two dns-servers. If ns1 goes down (broken och rebooted due to updates or whatever) then the clients will query ns2 (otherwise they will not be able to query any server and by that doesnt know which ip to connect to if FQDN's are used in configs).  When using anycast the network could direct the query to whatever server that is still online."
networking,3cm3v9,clay584,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:32:59 2015 UTC,"When you define your DHCP scopes, alternate which server comes first in the list. This should help to some degree.  But then again I'd just call it pointless and not care which server is serving the majority of the load."
networking,3cm3v9,clay584,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:54:01 2015 UTC,"DNS is resilient in that the clients understand to try the alternate if the primary fails.  Clients should do round robin, but if they are not, you could load balance behind a reverse-proxy (F5, A10, haproxy, etc.).  As far as the master/slave situation, just use ns1 as master and ns2 as slave.  For the split DNS situation, you should use bind views.  Views allow the serving of different RRs depending on where the query originates.  OR... You could stand up a second set of bind servers.  One pair is for public resolution, and the other pair is for internal resolution.  Then just maintain the internal zone on one set, and the external zone on the other set of servers."

You'll be able to see live WiFi signal strengths (RSSI, a/b/g/n signal speed) with vendor names, SSIDs per antenna by MAC, and mapping for possible signal. Total co-channel and interfering antennas are listed by number; selecting an antenna will color-code each in the live list involved in said totals. It does show and map bonded channels (40MHz, 80MHz).

networking,3cll6d,ml0v,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:53 2015 UTC,"Emphasis on ""most"". The biggest issue with ECMP/anycast is that when a server is added to or removed from the pool, all connections can get moved to new hosts, which will break in-flight requests. If your clients are well-behaved enough to just reconnect and retry, this might be okay - it's usually fine for web traffic - but consider this carefully. There are some higher-end switches (Juniper QFX comes to mind) that can do consistent hashing, which makes this a bit less painful, but it's still not as clean as how a stateful LB would handle pool membership changes.  The other big issue with ECMP/anycast is that you can run into MTU issues since the ICMP packet-too-big messages that PMTU discovery depends on often won't hit the same server whose packet generated the error. Cloudflare published code for an interesting hack to fix this, but it may not work in all environments - in particular, it depends on all of your ECMP targets being in the same L2 domain.  Still, it's an interesting way of doing this, and I'd be interested in seeing more folks involved. We might actually come up with some better ways to make this work in the end as well :)"
networking,3cll6d,rekoil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:21:18 2015 UTC,"As you've said - there are fixes for both issues. Actually, there are more fixes than you'd expect! Fastly do some crazy-ass L2 re-write to move stuff in/out of their pools (It's super impressive).   AS for IPv6 and anycast. It's been broken by design, however it's been worked on.   In $previous_job, I build a rather large (20bn hits/month) anycast network with minimal issues using ECMP and Anycast. Flow hashing was non-issue. Biggest issue was peering tbh."
networking,3cll6d,HoorayInternetDrama,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:32 2015 UTC,"You're right that rehashing is generally a non-issue for web browsers and other well-behaved clients that will automatically reconnect/retry upon receiving a TCP RST on the existing connection. But I'd still recommend testing that carefully before implementation - make sure your server app can handle, say, duplicate stateful requests (say, a client sends a POST based on a ""purchase"" action, but the connection is interrupted, so the client reconnects and sends the same POST. Make sure that doesn't result in buying the same item twice).  I'm aware of the Fastly work on this, but I don't think they've open-sourced their solution (if they have, I'd love to know about it!).  As for PMTU discovery, you're correct that there's more than one way to fix. I've also seen more than one large content provider fix this by simply sending smaller packets - usually 1350 bytes. There's also RFC 4821 which can effectively work around the issue, albeit with unavoidable delays as the sending host has to wait for a timeout to notice the fact that it needs to send smaller packets.   One way I'd love to see this fixed would be if the HW vendors could use the ICMP payload instead of the packet header for flow hashing; the payload of an ICMP error packet contains the header of the offending packet, so that data could be retrieved and used in lieu of the actual src/dst IP of the ICMP packet to make the flow hashing decision, and the packet would follow to the same destination as the source of the offending packet."

And then finally you take in quotes (incl any discounts) and compare both technical results (which device actually worked but also how well it worked in terms of performance, concurrent connections and whatelse) and the economical aspect.  If you do this properly you will end up with the best device which fits your business and wallet.

I mean like do you need SSL-offloading or not? Will TLS 1.0 work or do you need TLS 1.2 or even 1.3 for this offloading? Is it pure TCP-session loadbalance or do you want to perform some ""magic"" through scripting on the sessions who passes by (like inspect within the http-packet like cookies and such) and so on...

At my last job (web host) we had a customer migrate to a new platform and our sales guys sold them on an F5 LTM... around $250k, I think, which was well over half the total equipment cost of the migration. It ran like a pig, and after about 3 weeks of back-and-forth with F5 support (phone time for our NetOps team, not email), we eventually sorted it out by disabling virtually everything and cabling it in a way that seemed ... excessive.  A few months later we had to migrate them to a new datacenter, and (like any reasonable person would) balked at having to buy another one to maintain uptime during the move. So we put in one of our cheapest servers at the time (around $1k) running CentOS and IPVS/LVS. It ran circles around the F5, and did all the same stuff (since we had to shut off all the cool F5-y stuff to make it even passable). The entire documentation for setting one up from ""no OS"" to ""balancing traffic"" fit on 2 pages, and could be done by anyone on-staff. The F5 could only be managed by members of NetOps. We sold them an HA pair of them and never looked back... it became our standard load balancing setup from there on out, and for a couple years after (before I left), we never sold another F5 product at all.  This was about 6 years ago. Perhaps things are better now, but I personally have never heard anyone reminisce positively about an F5 box... it's always bad.  If I were in your shoes, I'd be strenuously arguing for something else. I don't think I'd ever willingly use F5 again without some paperwork that says it's not my fault if it doesn't perform as advertised.  If nothing else, Riverbed SteelApp (formerly Stingray, formerly Zeus... now owned by Brocade) is a pretty reasonable setup for a lot less than an F5 LTM. It won't do quite as much, but they do an awful lot... caching, gzipping, logging, SSL termination, rules engine, etc."

That being said, the F5 GUI makes things ridiculously easy when it comes to doing all of config syncing, reloading, etc that IPVS/LVS doesn't do automatically.

Finding switches is really nasty this way, the easyest way IMO is to just find the switches and follow cables or look at their mac address tables: For example R1 and R2 have a neighborship with at least S1 between them.  Get into S1 and look for R1's and R2's mac address, are there many diffrent MAC addresses attached to those ports?  If so it means there is probably a switch attached to it, also it never hurts to look at Spanning-tree.  Hopefully all the switches in a STP area have a managment IP address in the same subnet and you can do a ""ping 255.255.255.255"" then assuming it's vlan 300 a ""sh arp Vlan300"" this will show you all the IPs in vlan 300, start SSHing to them and see what's a switch  This should at least get you started."

That is unless you want to direct unknown traffic to a network tap for recording (good way to spot an infected client, if the malware isnt proxyaware you can then (with some luck) see an infected client trying to connect to all sort of ip addresses you dont use internally which then will end up with the network tap)."

networking,3clk9t,Apachez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:04:34 2015 UTC,"ACL is often the fastest (performancewise) and most efficient way to drop unwanted traffic and compared to the routingmethod more granular (you can allow/drop on portlevel or various TCP-flags etc where routingmethod can only drop on destination ip (and if uRPF strict is being used also on source ip for the same ip range)).  Given that ACL's (or rather ACE's) are kind of limited in how many they can be (normally about max 1000 or so per interface) using the routingmethod will make it possible for you to drop even more ipranges than with ACL.  Also note that the routingmethod (specially for distribution) can (if you didnt properly protect the routingprotocols being used) be altered by an evil client/host, where in order to alter an ACL you need first to get root on the switch/router.  The above gives that using the routingmethod to sinkhole or even blackhole traffic is often far easier in a large network to perform instead of logging into hundreds or thousands of routers/switches to update their ACLs.  So to sum it up:  ACL for performance and for static filtering (for example customerfacing interface).  Routingmethod (RTBH - Remotely Triggered Black Hole) is more dynamic and if properly setup you can faster push out that you dont wish to handle traffic to/from a specific ip or ip range (for example to be used in core and border routers)."

networking,3clk9t,Apachez,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:00:33 2015 UTC,The nullrouting?  Either you nullroute directly like so:  ip route x.x.x.x/yy null0  or indirectly:  ip route x.x.x.x/yy 192.0.2.1 ip route 192.0.2.1 null0  the good thing with the later is that you can use your dynamic routing protocols to nullroute on demand by pointing the route with nexthop to 192.0.2.1 (who then will resolve into null0 within the equipment). If you also do uRPF strict you can by this filter traffic in both ways (with no ACL needed since the RIB will take care of this for you).  For IPv6 I (and others) use 2001:DB8:0:DEAD:BEEF::1 as the equal to 192.0.2.1 to be the nullrouted hostaddress.

networking,3cmfwu,PehSyCho,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:14:58 2015 UTC,"Well according to the packet capture, it is hitting the filter because the packets are having the DSCP bits modified so it has to be hitting the EF queue at least once for it to happen.

networking,3cmfwu,cocaina_rhinoplasty,2,Thu Jul 9 03:09:38 2015 UTC,So what exactly is your issue?  I'm curious if dscp tagging traffic destined for the Internet is really going to help with your problems.
networking,3cmfwu,admin4hire,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:41:00 2015 UTC,Well it has been a back and forth with our sip provider for the past year or so... we have episodes of high jitter and poor call quality and they are adament it is a lan issue on our side but i have not been able to find anything that could cause the problem. The only thing i can see is if the QoS isn't configured properly and sip and rtp traffic is ending up in best-effort queue. From what i have seen the filters are correctly tagging dscp descriptors but i should be seeing this traffic remain in EF queues which i am not seeing. I suppose i could add another filter on that interface to check for an EF descriptor and put it in the correct queue but i feel like that is defeating the whole point of configuring dscp rewrites...
networking,3cmfwu,admin4hire,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:07:21 2015 UTC,"I think the comment is more along the lines that even if you put QoS up to your internet connection, the minute you hit your internet service provider they are going to drop any markings you have on it anyway.    The default on Juniper is just best effort and network control forwarding-classes unless you set them up.  From the O'Reilly Enterprise Routing Book -   ""The default CoS setting supports two forwarding classes (BE and NC)""  So while there are 4 queues setup you only have two forwarding classes at work - BE and NC.  You'll have to setup a forwarding class for EF.    Still don't see it fixing the issue through.    See this below:   You can try toggling ALG for SIP and see if it helps. https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB25546"

You are right in that it won't matter once the traffic has left the network but it should prioritize sending the traffic out to the ISP, meaning traffic coming in on ge-0/0/4 is being marked with DSCP bits to put EF. My interpretation would be that I should now see these packets leaving the SRX in the EF queue to go to the ISP. They should be prioritized over all other traffic."
networking,3cmfwu,admin4hire,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:07:46 2015 UTC,I overlooked you posted the configs.    Did you get a counter added to the filter classify traffic under the terms sip and rtp to verify they were getting hit?

Im wondering what could be causing that. The first term in the filter should catch SIP traffic. Is it possible to set a counter for the first term in a rule or will I have to break it out to create a separate filter to monitor it?  edit: Also, thanks for the help!"

It is designed to provide broad-based protection at the ingress zone (i.e. the zone where traffic enters the firewall) and are not designed to protect a specific end host or traffic going to a particular destination zone. To augment the zone protection capabilities on the firewall, use the DoS protection rulebase to match on a specific zone, interface, IP address or user.

networking,3ck9co,thegreattriscuit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you anything SUPER detailed because I don't have that much experience, but I've definitely found that in general if you can firmly quantify things, there seems to be less push back.    So instead of saying ""we're growing, so we need to build in the extra capacity now (or have the option to add the capacity later)"", do the research and say something like   ""our traffic has grown by X% per month, and given <upcomming projects, etc.> we expect that rate to [hold steady | increase | whatever].  Given this rate of growth our infrastructure [has  been | will begin to be] oversubscribed, which [has led | will lead] to an ever degrading standard of service.  The expected lifetime of this solution will be X years.  Vendor support is guaranteed for X years.  The proposed solution is sized to account for up to X times the established rate of growth for X years.  <other details about how long the new gear should last at different rates>  In the event sustained growth greatly exceeds the current rate the proposed solution permits the following upgrade/expansion paths at a modest price and without significant redesign effort if and when they become necessary:  <details about the expansion options that exist today, and how much they are likely to cost in X years, how long they are guaranteed to be available from the vendor, etc... >  Stuff like that.  I would say, of course, that if you don't HAVE those numbers, probably not a good idea to make them up.  If you throw numbers at them, they can always come back and hold you to them.  But the same holds for vague half-assed arguments.  I'd rather be held to a clearly defined standard that I had a hand in crafting than deal with ""You said it would be 'faster', and my Outlook is still slow!"".  If you can't give a real rate of growth (full disclosure:  I certainly cannot in my current position.  It's on my TODO list, geeze...) you can absolutely document the current situation with interface counters, wireshark, and go from there.   (usage is X, current solution is rated for Y).  Find the soundest citable basis for an estimated growth rate you can, and use that.  And of course, in so doing you set the baseline for future measurements and can figure out the trend later.    Now, I WILL say that, ideally, this work would have been done in this detail as part of deciding what solution to go with in the first place, but I understand that's not always realistic.  And shit, there's ""using exacting detail to come up with an optimal solution"", and then there's ""We had a good quarter, if we're ever going to be able to get rid of the shit you've been complaining about, this is the chance.  Should be able to swing about 60k.  Send me the proposal ASAP before it goes away"", so I'm not judging on you too hard.    Along that same vein if, due to time constraints, limited data, or the like, you have to make broad estimates, go for it.  Just try to base them on the best real data you can, and be upfront about it.  ""Sensible estimates based upon our current usage, the overall rate of growth in our datacenter (number of VMs provisioned... disk usage over time... there's SOME kind of data you can use SOMEWHERE), and industry best practices"" isn't a terrible place to start."
networking,3ck9co,cessation23,2,Wed Jul 8 22:28:16 2015 UTC,One of the big reasons we are doing the upgrade is for more 10GbaseT ports for some nimble storage guys.  I have some time before submitting to gather some specific usage statistics. I bet that would look good as you said. I have also gotten some growth projections from the server guys thrown in there.  Staying ahead of life cycles is pretty important around here so I have any of the hardware being upgraded included with a nice little lifecycle rotation description.   We use a generalized AFE structure which has to have a cash payback period. I like to include the calculation of daily sales vs network down for x period of time type stuff as well.
networking,3ck9co,Dataplumber,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:17:43 2015 UTC,"yup.  Sounds like good reasoning.  I didn't really account for ""new capabilities/features"" in what I said earlier at all, but would definitely be an important part of the justification.    What I wrote turned into a novel and all of that won't be feasible or appropriate for all situations, but it's the sort of thing I try to shoot for when I'm writing justifications.    I've been shot down by people that capitalize on wording before.  You say ""a lot"" and they say ""it's not that much"" and you wind up in this situation where they're done thinking about it and won't care if you bring real numbers later.

This is all meta-information that speaks to experience documenting and explaining their networks.  Ill also usually ask them to make some change, or what they would change and have them diagram that and then ask them questions about it.  Added HSRP or VRRP config and a second switch, how fast is failover and is there anyway to improve that number?  Added BGP to your BGR, do you want full routes or a summary?  Why?  How does one summarize?    This is actually my favorite part of the interview because to me it tells me the most about the future interactions I will have with the candidate."

You would be better off asking them what they believe is a suitable number of hosts to have available in a subnet for a certain type of network (you have an office with 30-50 employees, they connect via wireless with a laptop, a phone and possibly a tablet/iPad).  Make sure they understand the difference between a /21 and a /24. Make sure they understand what inter-vlan routing is and maybe provide a bunch of configurations for a dummy network that has a problem or 2 (not random junk problems, but real world stuff you would actually see).  Check if they understand what VLAN tagging is and how your network can tell the difference between your VoIP Phone and your laptop without you having to tell it.  Tell them you have a laptop that is not receiving an IP address and see if they can figure out by looking at a configuration that an ip-helper is missing.  Have them explain trust boundaries for DHCP snooping and why you would not want someone to have the ability to plug in a home router wreak havoc.  Ask them about spanning tree, how it is set up and where you would put the root bridge for certain scenarios.  Get them to draw a diagram of a network they have worked on and ask them about the importance of descriptions on equipment.  Ask about CDP and how it can be helpful if you are thrown into a network with basically nil documentation...

networking,3cgii1,BroadStreet_Bully3,7,Wed Jul 8 00:22:01 2015 UTC,You are only going to get its MAC if it is on the same subnet as you.  That's why you traceroute to find the router it is attached to and arp for the MAC from there.  Then it is just a matter of checking the MAC table on the switches on that subnet till you identify the culprit.

The CCNA cert is an easy entry level cert, but it doesn't mean someone can just do everything under the sun without experience/training.  Just keep in mind, that if you want someone who can do everything already, be a complete self-manager, and hit the ground running, you're hiring a network engineer with 5-7 years of experience, not an entry-level network admin.

I like how you go to foundational questions. I do the exact same for everything. It's usually not about the high density extremely difficult questions (in fact these just waste time in an interview). If a candidate has a good foundation and understands it at the same time, then that's usually a good sign that they know their shit.

If RADIUS is involved, do they understand how access-requests and access-challenges go back and forth, and what's responsible for passing them on behalf of client devices?

As far as FlexConnect vs Local, in your case I might go with Flexconnect but depends on the tunnel and bandwidth you will have for the Site to Site.

Depends on where you are, who your ISP is, and what sort of connectivity you have.   there is a hop #4 to #5 that goes from around 15ms to 59ms   Yes, there are several reasons you'd see a spike in traceroute results. Could be a relatively long link. Also, MPLS networks often give the illusion of a sudden latency spike because of how the TTL exceeded packets are forwarded. (I'm oversimplifying it quite a bit.) That's possibly what's happening here since the ping remains the same from Edmonton all the way to Toronto. What you're actually seeing is the ping time to Toronto.  A 59 millisecond time will be barely noticeable when browsing the web."

networking,3cknig,profmonocle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:18:26 2015 UTC,"I realize it depends on the connection, at home in the same city I get 13ms and at work I'm getting between 60-90 ms so I'm wondering if something is up with my work ISP.   Your home ISP probably peers with Google in a local IXP, or has an on-network cache. It seems Bell Canada doesn't, hence why it goes all the way to Toronto. It's not really a problem with your work ISP, they've probably just decided it's not worth it to peer locally.   Hop #4 to #5 is Edmonton to Edmonton is it not?   It is, but like I said, the latency spike is an illusion because of how the network works. Traceroutes estimate hop-by-hop latency by sending packets with progressively higher TTL (TTL = the maximum number of routers the packet can pass through before being discarded.) Each router that the packet goes through decrements the TTL by one. When the TTL reaches zero, the router sends an error packet (known as ""ICMP time exceeded"") back to the original sender. The time between when the original packet was sent and when the error packet arrives is given as the latency for that hop.  The issues here is (most likely) because of how MPLS works. MPLS is a network technology used by many large-scale networks. For reasons I won’t get into, the error packet isn’t immediately sent back to the source, it’s sent all the way to the point where the original packet would have left the MPLS network before it gets sent back.  In hop 5, the error packet is being generated in Edmonton, however it has to travel all the way to Toronto before it can get to you. Hence why the every hop after that has nearly the same latency - all those return packets are coming from roughly the same place. This might sound inefficient or wasteful, but the performance benefits of MPLS greatly outweigh this downside, especially since ICMP error packets are a microscopically small portion of overall network traffic.  I’m oversimplifying things greatly, but what you really should understand is that traceroute isn’t as great a tool as it might seem. It’s basically a hack that takes advantage of how these error packets work, and what it tells you should only be considered a very rough, partially inaccurate estimate of how the network is set up."

networking,3ch0q5,splenetic,6,Wed Jul 8 07:59:46 2015 UTC,"Two reasons I see.  First is that phone systems are usually patched with a singled, unjacketed, twisted pair. Ethernet ones are patched with cords that have four pairs, an outer jacket, and in some cases an inner plastic cross for maintaining inter-pair twist.  This adds a huge amount of bulk.  Second, when you punch down a phone cross connect you're effectively making a custom length patch cord.  This means that with a little care and creative routing, you have a modest service loop on each end not a inch more.  Ethernet cords, on the other hand, typically come in fixed lengths. Need a bundle of 50 8' cords to make your rack perfect?  Sorry, you get to pick from too long and too short, so you go with 10' as the closest working size. You now have an extra 100' of cable to accommodate somewhere.  Throw in a few moves - or even the requirement to handle them - and things can get ugly in a hurry."
networking,3ch0q5,fsweetser,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:28:20 2015 UTC,"From my experience, your reasons make up the bulk of it.  Back during my early days as the cabling monkey, I often wondered the same thing.  I really gave an honest effort to manage the cabling as best I could as the requests came in, but eventually it still turned into a mess.  I just couldn't fathom why all the cable trunks behind the patch panels could look so neat and organized, while all my cabling in front was just spaghetti.  You're absolutely right that managing all that excess cable just becomes inordinately difficult when you're dealing with fixed length cables when you can't disconnect the existing cabling, especially with longer runs where you're looking at a difference of several feet between lengths.  Bundling things up only goes so far, and it all goes to hell the first time someone comes along and is tracing something back.  I did see an attempt during a data center build to have all the cabling to the devices customized.  Granted, the cable guys we got were pretty crap, but, still, even on our part we had changing requirements and limited time.  So by the end of it, in between repurposing already existing cables and re-doing the bad cables, I'm really not convinced we came out much better in the end, at least for the cost."

How many guys installing network cables are real, certified, Bellcore standard following installers? My educated guess says not too many.

But you better time lapse that shit, cause it ain't quick!   This is spot on.  In my experience, the phone wiring is normally contracted out to certified contractors and every one is terminated at install time no matter if they are used or not.  Rarely are additional runs added for phones.    On the networking side, most are terminated into the patch panel but only enough switch ports are purchased to accommodate exactly what is live at install time.  As new devices are added, new cables from the patch panel to the switches are needed and new switches as well.    Normally these cables are ran by whatever admin/engineer drew the short straw instead of by certified contractors.  The network patch cables are often bulk purchased instead of cut to length also which leads to excessive cable hanging around.  Everyone knows that admins/engineers only run them like that because they are temporary and we will fix it later :)"

You can also probably announce /32 prefixes to your transit providers to tell them to drop all traffic towards specific IPs, meaning most of the traffic is dropped before it even reaches your network.  You should also look  at the Flowspec protocol.

Alternatively, they may partner with some of the bigger outfits and can provide services at a discount (e.g. Verisign, Prolexic acq. by Akamai, Blacklotus acq by Level3, DosArrest, NexusGuard, etc).

For people like us (Me, Can't comment on you exactly) DDoS's fill the transit far before they cause a problem elsewhere. Putting in an appliance that can identify this traffic and auto-drop it is pointless if it's still filling the pipe getting to said appliance.  If I were you, I would be looking at some of the hosted services. Where they advertise your prefixes.

I'm assuming I need to add a route to the routing table of R1?   Probably not.  If M3 can ping M1 then that means that the ping responses from M1 are being routed to M3 correctly (M1->R1->R2->M3) and no additional route is necessary.  The two most common things that can cause this are:   Violating the one subnet per VLAN rule, and Firewall rules.   Keep in mind that by default, Windows machines don't respond to ping or pretty much anything else when their firewall is on.    The troubleshooting process is:   Fix R2's subnet so it's either 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.0.0.0/8.  192.168.1.0/8 is wrong. Verify that the following ARP table entries are present and correct:   R1: M1, M2, R2 M1: R1 M2: R1 R2: M3, M4, R1 M3: R2 M4: R2 If any of these ARP table entries aren't present after test pings, then verify that physical connectivity is correct and try again.  Verify that R2 is in fact connected to INET via R1 as per your diagram.  This is highly unusual, and what's probably going on is that INET, R1, and R2 are all on the same subnet, not two different INET-R1 and R1-R2 subnets. Assuming you do have the highly unusual configuration above, then verify the following routing table entries are present:   M1: Default gateway R1 M2: Default gateway R1 R1: Default gateway INET, R2's subnet via R2 R2: Default gateway R1 (NOT INET) M3: Default gateway R2 M4: Default gateway R2 Common problem here: Multiple default gateways defined on M1 and M2.

Do not lie - they will find out, and it will look worse than if you had just fessed up to being a pot head in uni.  Past indiscretions like this are easily explained away, especially if they aren't super recent.  Lying to an interview panel or HR is not.   If you're concerned, and your jurisdiction allows it, I would suggest doing a background check on yourself and seeing what comes up.  In my area, only criminal convictions (ie, a judge is involved) show up, so some of your past might not even be included.  If you do see something on there that you don't like, you can consult a lawyer to see about having the conviction expunged.  As for how a potential employer would react, well, that depends on the employer.  For us, it all depends on the conviction, and how recent it is.  If doing dumb stuff in uni disqualified people from working in education, we wouldn't have any employees left.  If asked, you might answer the question by talking about how you motivated yourself to clean up your act.    This only applies to our environment, which is government / education.  Other industries like banking or defence may be significantly more strict.  If it really bothers you, consult a lawyer to see about having the convictions removed from your record.  It will cost a few thousand dollars, but you may find it worth it.  In my industry, we would probably hire you, and the lawyer would be a waste of time and money."

Port mirror the internal firewall\proxy connection and send this packet data to something like NetFort LANGuardian.

It will probably hard reset the phase 1 tunnels without informing the other side, which is probably why you're seeing the first tunnel go down. Have you tried pinging something on the other side of the tunnel from behind the ASA that isn't the remote tunnel endpoint? Try to send some traffic through and then post the cleaned output of ""show crypto isakmp sa"" and ""show crypto ipsec sa"". Then we'll be able to see if your tunnels are coming up properly."

A seperate VLAN gives you an isolated broadcast domain.  Thats handy.    A seperate VLAN can give you a QoS policy, specific to your VLAN.  That can also be useful.    Putting things in a dedicated VLAN means a router has to help move traffic in and out of that VLAN.  L3 Netflow is easier/cheaper than L2 Netflow, so when the router moves the packets, he can inform the Netflow collector of the activity, and you can now visualize the traffic flow in a pretty Netflow chart/graphic.    Putting things in a dedicated VLAN lets you apply an ingress and/or egress ACL to the VLAN interface to let you control trafic flows.  This can be useful, but can also be a nightmare to manage.

For the past few years layer 2 CAM tables have felt really small. 64,000... 128,000 MAC addresses? Not big enough.  Everything is going through some variation of a GRE tunnel to a core aggregation device which limits the layer 2 broadcast domain to the tunnel itself. It essentially becomes a layer 3 solution and CAM tables are no longer a concern. Scaling into the millions of concurrent devices becomes a much more feasible concept. The idea can be scaled down small networks as well (Cisco ASR1k EoGRE, ALU SRxxx, Benu MEG, etc).

We have moved to a loop-free design with vPCs mostly and some VSS, though you still absolutely must run STP to avoid unintentional loops.  Currently we're collapsing a lot of our routing back to a few large L3 switches and replacing distribution switches with L2 Nexus gear running vPCs. We restrict our VLANs to designated trunks, and this has vastly simplified our routing headaches. VRFs have been proliferating like crazy, and without going to MPLS, this allows us to keep scaling.  L2 is quite scalable if properly segmented and designed. If you send your vlans everywhere and/or are overall careless in your design, it can turn in to a nightmare quick."

networking,3cb7lk,Joe_testing,2,Mon Jul 6 23:49:41 2015 UTC,Our old network had some simply enormous L2 domains. Way beyond the recommended STP diameter limits. This was running Cisco RPVST+. It didn't take much going wrong to tip it over the edge into instability. I was constantly amazed it worked at all.  Our new network has RSTP right at the edge and that's it. All switch-switch links are LAGs between virtual chassis members so we don't have any single points of failure. We retain it at the edge simply to allow bpduguard to shut down looped ports. This is the model we've had in our data centre for a few years and it's been great there. We're looking at possibly going full-mesh in the DC but we're yet to be convinced that it's worth it at our relatively small scale.   I'd like everything to be L3 as that makes my life so much easier. Sadly I think we're still a way to go for that as it does cause issues for end devices. VXLAN and its ilk are kludges that will help paper over the cracks for a while but I think we need a fundamental re-think about how application servers are built to make them less reliant on static IP addresses so we don't have to worry about spreading L2 domains across multiple areas.
networking,3cb7lk,splenetic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"It depends on the design and resources. In my case the L2 design is always present because most customers run a small network (1-500 users), collapsed core/dist, good segmentation, etc. When we go to bigger customers we tend to use L3 all the way to the ""access"" switches so we can reach a better convergence time tuning the timers or using BFD. L2 will always be present in some kind of way and every technology manage it differently. You can see it with those technologies you mentioned and Fabric Path, Cisco ACI infrastructure."

networking,3cce0l,bobsmon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:28:07 2015 UTC,For the best you might want to look at the Cisco 4948E[1].  It has a 17.5MB shared packet buffer[2] which can help decrease drops on VOIP when the network is being hammered (check out microbursting).  Supports VLAN/QoS as well.  [1]http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-4948e-ethernet-switch/data_sheet_c78-598933.html  [2]http://people.ucsc.edu/~warner/buffer.html
networking,3cce0l,bobsmon,2,Tue Jul 7 00:43:32 2015 UTC,"The Catalyst 4948E is a great switch, based on Catalyst 4500 technologies.    But your use case or reason to leverage it as a tool doesn't make any sense.    The 4948 does indeed have an unusually large packet buffer for a Cisco device at 17.5MB, and deeper buffers can be a very valuable tool for preventing packet drops for certain types of traffic.    But VoIP should always be marked as DSCP ""EF"" or otherwise placed into the Hardware Priority Queue.    The Priority Queue is serviced first among all the packet queues in the switch, and is often serviced until empty, so VoIP packets are seldom placed into packet buffer memory at all.    A shallow buffer switch like a 2960X should be able to service as much realistic VoIP traffic as you throw at it.    200kbps per phone call times 48 phones = 9600kbps or about 10Mbps of VoIP traffic.  Most VoIP calls are down in the 80kbps range, so this would be an extreme example.  But 10Mbps of VoIP exiting a switch via a 1Gbps uplink via the Priority Queue should be a trivial undertaking for any 2960."

networking,3cej5l,Gegabone,2,Tue Jul 7 08:02:48 2015 UTC,"What benefit do you gain from checking the port?  Is this some kind of license check?  I would suggest a simple way to deal with this (which will also solve other problems with broken connections...)  Whenever a new connection for a specific client comes in, the server will check to see if the old connection is still alive.  If it is, the new one will be rejected (already in use), if not the old connection will be killed and the new one accepted.  However in concept, I don't see any useful reason to check which PORT the connection comes from.  If I knew more about what exactly you were trying to accomplish with this I could advise better, but failing that, I suggest just remove the port verification.  To answer your questions though:   Yes this behavior (source port randomization) is expected.  A large number of NAT firewalls will randomize the source port, this increases both security and capacity (without it, if two clients connect FROM the same port, one of those connections won't work).   To fix it the clients will have to configure their router/firewall to use static port mapping for connections from your product or connections to your server IP.  Whether or not this is possible and how it's done is depends on what type of router/firewall they use. There are a very few situations when checking source port would be useful, but it's a short list.  Unless checking source port gives you something that you can't get any other way, I suggest don't bother."

That said, from the surface their proxy and your security policies are working as expected. Many ways to skin the cat, but two major avenues that shouldn't be too politically involved.   They whitelist the domain of your servers to bypass the proxy. You whitelist the IP of their proxy to allow multiple connections.   Given the perceived brightness of your client's admins, number 2 seems like a fair route.   Without knowing more details of the software though, its hard to say if that requirement is antiquated. Generally speaking, NAT/PAT is used quite widely too and can bring up these same types of issues under certain circumstances."

networking,3cb2n0,Busbyuk,3,Mon Jul 6 17:58:13 2015 UTC,Have you checked the MSS and MTU sizes within the packet capture? I've experienced this issue with some Macbooks recently.
networking,3cb2n0,DNDNDN0101,2,Mon Jul 6 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"Had the same issue, dropped the MTU to around 1280 I believe."
networking,3cb2n0,phessler,2,Mon Jul 6 15:50:18 2015 UTC,Quick question for others; could this have possibly been due to a firewall/proxy service?
networking,3cb2n0,SuddenWeatherReport,2,Mon Jul 6 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"Without reading too much about this, I'm pretty sure that this is a MTU problem. I've seen this many times in many situations be down to MTU settings. Part of the problem is ACL's usually block ICMP messages which are used to negotiate the MTU size & any fragmentation that is required when a TCP connection is being established. So put a permit any any ACL on and reduce the MTU for the purpose of testing (tell your manager to STFU if he starts crying about security, and tell him you are just testing it). See if you can just drop your TCP MSS down a touch too. So set it to like 1350, and put your IP MTU to like 1400 (I have no idea what protocols you are running so I don't know what headers you're gonna need to account for with the MTU settings. If you post your protocols I will give you the MTU specific values to use) I'm about 90% sure this will be the cause of the issue.  The actual underlying reason why only some pages load is because, let's say a web server is using a 1400 MTU size ok? Now you sent a 1420 MTU towards it. The server needs to tell the client that he should fragment packets before sending them. This is done using, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) type 3 code 4 packet (Destination Unreachable; Fragmentation Needed and DF set). However, on your FW, usually a lot of noob admins don't understand this and just block ICMP completely, so the type 3 and 4 ICMP messages never get back to the client. So the packet can't get fragmented. So the data continues to reach to the server and the server continues to reply with ICMP type 3 and 4's as the packet is too large & is being sent with the DF bit set."

LACP and VLAN-Tagging is available on all avaya ethernet routing switches (ERS series and the VSPs), even the smaller ones so it should be no problem!  The only reason i see for you to take the 4000 instead of the 3000 would be redundant power supply and maybe if you want them to be your router.

Yes, there is of course a method to add a VLAN to an existing LACP trunk without network disruptions, I just wouldn't trust it and have never actually done it in production due to the high risk of messing things up. It's not as simple as add another VLAN and be done with it as you have to de-construct the LACP-trunk before you can add another VLAN to it.  So my recommendation without irony is to stay as far away from Avaya as possible and buy anything else (Cisco, HP or whatever).  Also, don't use the Avayas as routers."

I'd say I'm an low/intermediate hacker but have 10 years of experience administering networks and security. It's very easy. A decent hacker can go one step further though. The best kinds of ""fun"" hacks are just scanning the network and checking what OS & versions are running on the other machines, then checking what antivirus' they are using (most of this can be done using NMAP to be honest). What you then have to do is just find an exploit for that particular OS, then FUD that exploit so that antivirus doesn't spot it (basically you'd usually pay a guy to FUD your exploit because he's reverse engineered the antivirus in question and found a way through). The exploit usually then contains the code that performs an action. So one I've used in the past is called a RAT, where basically I just have complete remote control of the other machine without the user being aware that I actually have this. If you are being mean, just delete the registry files and break the machine. Or what you can do is script a key-logger into the software to give you better access to the targets data on various websites. If you have a very amateur person who just wants to piss people off, then a quick way to cause traffic loss is by joining the network and putting your IP as the gateway address. If you have IP forwarding disabled (default on most OS's), then providing you respond quicker than the router for that IP, then you blackhole peoples traffic. There's hundreds of things you can do, it just depends how much data you want from your targets. I'd say about 60-70% of network penetration can be prevented by the network admin, but the rest is down to the targets knowledge and own self-protection."

The loopback-detection will send out a broadcast packet containing its own mac-address (and I think some other data) and if this packet shows up on any of the other interfaces it can then detect that there exists a loopback and take proper action (either just log or shutdown the interface where the packet looped at).

You need to have a route map that has a first line denying TCP 179 so your BGP peering isn't affected, then a second line matching the source interface, then a third line sending it to whatever the next hop for the /24 is in your routing table, so it ignores the /32 when it comes in from that interface.

When a packet comes in from the ISP destined for 10.10.1.10 it'd normally go out vlan 100 via port 3, but if 10.10.1.10/32 is being picked up by the filters it'll go into port 2 and return via port 2.

If you can get a couple good entry level internships in your remaining time at school and finish a mid-level certification, you might be qualified to interview for a tier 2 position.  Network engineering is something that's somewhere between difficult and impossible to teach.  Spending time in a junior position allows you to see a wide range of issues without being ultimately responsible for solving them.    Interviews will generally focus very heavily on situational troubleshooting, because at tier 2+ your value to a company is based on your ability to quickly recognize, diagnose, and troubleshoot complex, multi-factor issues.  And any positions above that will rely heavily upon that operations experience to design networks that won't have those issues in the first place."

I really used a terrible choice of words in the original post; I'm just looking for the most appropriate starting position given my situation.

Realistically I think some of the best experience you could get at this point is as remote hands.  You will be directly following the instructions of someone else, but you will also get some access to and insight into their thought processes.  And also learn how to prioritize during installations and outages.   A ""junior engineer"" is still expected to have a basic level of knowledge and experience, and be able to resolve basic problems on their own before escalating.  That's why the 2-5 year requirement.  I think you could be competitive at that level of interview if you got a decent internship and finished your CCNA.  The internship would be the more important of the two.

To make this work, the first line was in the center, and the next line would be the two wires on either side of the first, and so on. This is why one of the pairs in an ethernet cable is split across the middle. The outer ones are not split because while this method worked great for phones, it caused too much crosstalk inside the connector with the pairs split along parallel paths. The middle two kept their pinout for backwards compatibility with phones. The order of the wires within a pair are not swapped for crosstalk, but rather so that the colors will alternate between solid and striped to make it easier to spot an improper order."

networking,3cat4w,oloflundgren,2,Mon Jul 6 13:30:14 2015 UTC,First you want to confirm that DFS events are happening and get an idea of how frequently they happen.  It's not always the case that you'll see a DFS event when close to radar.  DFS channel changes are a non-issue for newer Intel-based chipsets that support 802.11h channel switch announcements since clients roam seamlessly to another channel.  For Apple devices though it's highly disruptive sometimes having to go as far as to toggle wireless on and off to get reconnected.    A DFS event will generally make the channel unusable for 30 min (the FCC mandated non-occupancy period) so if you're seeing a lot of DFS events you might be better off avoiding DFS channels completely.  The next important thing to keep in mind is that not all DFS is equal.    Most implementations are so loosely defined to get through FCC testing that they get a lot of false positives ranging from microwave ovens to the extra noise transmitted from faulty Broadcom wireless chipsets.  Accurate DFS detection is VERY hard to do and something Cisco is claiming to have achieved (and they're patenting the hell out of it) see Cisco FlexDFS for details on that.  Also not that even with Cisco some code releases in the past have had DFS bugs triggering false positives so you really want to be running the latest code.  I don't have experience with Aerohive but unless they put a lot of work into DFS radar detection I would hesitate to use DFS channels if I'm seeing frequent DFS events.    Does Aerohive have any logging or debugging for DFS?  20M channels kind of suck since everything takes up more air time but if DFS is giving you problems then you probably don't have any choice but to go with 20M channels or stick with the 4 x 40M channels available.
networking,3cat4w,soucy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:11:11 2015 UTC,That is basically my understanding.  It will just jump channel anyway.  The feature is generally designed to make the channels usable by the device but ensure they are not in use where they might interfere.
networking,3cat4w,lathiat,2,Mon Jul 6 13:37:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah ok, but in a high-density (possibly) radar environment it could cause more problem than it is supposed to fix? Because the AP has to find a new channel and the AP has to follow, which is probably going to cause performance drops?"
networking,3cat4w,The_3_Packateers,2,Mon Jul 6 13:48:12 2015 UTC,"In my experience yes, it will cause more problems than its worth.

networking,3c9d9s,triplesek,5,Mon Jul 6 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"Habits  -Keep track of every problem you solve, what the symptoms were, what the resolution was, etc. If your ISP uses a ticketing system, keep track of the ticket numbers too for reference down the road.  -Question the path, there may be a device that is being overlooked  -Establish a set of questions to ask the end user depending upon the symptom(s)  -Never be afraid to ask the engineers questions. That is the best way to learn is the real world scenarios.   Like soucy mentioned, dig deep into the issues. Take the time to understand the issue and its resolution.    -Keep Googling, not every issue is documented in a text book.  -Be the person that strives to fix every issue, no matter where the issue is. You'll learn a LOT more and people will appreciate you more.   Topics  For an ISP- anything in the Cisco service provider track (or other vendor SP tracks). Or if the curriculum matches more closely to your enterprise, then maybe the route/switch track is the better option for topics to study.  Critical Thinking  -If the situation calls for it, I will ""lab"" up an issue and then evaluate the CLI output or Wireshark output and study the topic to learn the expected behavior, or what the output looks like before and after the change.  -The first thing to be concerned about is WHERE the issue is (assuming you already have a good description of the symptom(s)). Don't worry about the WHY until you know the WHERE.  -think about whats feasible for a device to do to packet(s) (drop it, delay it, modify it, duplicate it, reorder it, etc). If possible, figure out which one of these things are happening (Wireshark comes in handy here).  -Ask mutiple engineers questions, usually people will have a different way of troubleshooting than the other. Ask them why they ran a certain command or did a certain task, what is the output telling them and how do they know from that output what their next step is.  The path I took - not necessarily in a particular order  2-year degree in Computer Networking Passed certifications (A+, Network +, JNCIA, CCNA, CCNP) Asked the ""jedi masters"" a LOT of questions Read a lot of Cisco Press books Read RFCs  Read the vendor documentation"
networking,3c9d9s,packetwhisperer,3,Mon Jul 6 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"A few other things as well:  -Not every issue will have a single fix. There might be multiple fixes to an issue. For example poor speeds could be caused by an interface in half duplex as well as drops in a policer. Lets say both are happening and you were to fix the half-duplex condition. Someone will probably be inclined to believe that the duplex condition wasn't ""THE"" issue because there are still drops adding up in the policer after you fixed the half-duplex condition. And then once you fix the policer drops, then the issue is resolved.   -Just because you've identified where the issue is, that doesn't mean you've identified where the fix needs to take place. Once you've identified where the issue is, the fix may need to be applying a few devices away.  -Sometimes there is more than one way to fix an issue. Take the BGP AS_PATH attribute. When a BGP router sees its ASN in the AS_PATH it will reject the route by default. There are (at least) two ways to fix this (for instance if an MPLS network calls for it), you can add as-override at the neighboring BGP router, or you can add allow-as-in at the local BGP router. They will both fix the ""issue"", but you can fix the issue at multiple devices. Generally in these situations its good to follow best practices."
networking,3c9d9s,packetwhisperer,4,Mon Jul 6 05:01:17 2015 UTC,Sounds like you're on the right track.    You mentioned having to compare configurations?  Take the next step and start looking up the documentation on what each and every line of configuration does.  Spin up a test setup and play around with it until you know it inside out.  If you get stuck ask questions.  Ideally you should never apply configuration you don't understand.  Every good network engineer is obsessed with understanding how things work down to the smallest detail.  Don't stop at configuration.  Dig into the RFCs and IEEE standards and get an understanding of how major protocols are implemented and how things work in the physical world.  Eventually that understanding will come off to others as an intuitive sense once you've put in the effort to build up that foundational knowledge.  This is where the Jedi Master stuff happens.  A background in Computer Science or Computer Engineering is helpful once you start getting into the details.

networking,3cba2p,chuckbales,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"Do you have a .64 subinterface set up on your router? No connected route leads me to believe no interface. If it's not directly connected you'll need to tell the router how to get there, i.e. static route, etc.  edit: a subinterface is the 0/1.xxx interface, typically that last number corresponds to the vlan being tagged on the interface if it's been set up with any sense. You also seem to have both 65 and 67 on the same vlan. Are those working? Can you post your full sanitized config?"

networking,3cba2p,chuckbales,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"Based on that, your router doesn't have an interface for 10.33.64, nor does it know of that network existing somewhere else.  Check your interface configurations. Looks like you're using subinterfaces (G0/1.1, G0/1.66, G0/1.68), and 65/67 maybe secondary IPs on the g0/1.1 interface. And that IP space is broken into /24s (255.255.255.0), not one big 255.255.252.0.  Use sh run | s interface to see just the relevant configuration."

networking,3cba2p,ehcanada,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"You can add 64 into the g0/1.66 interface if you need to, as long as the devices configured with .64 addresses are in VLAN 66 on your switching (needs to match the dot1q configured on the router, which is 66)."
networking,3cba2p,ehcanada,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"Not going to lie, after the first bit there, I have no idea what your saying.  Call it a fundamental lack of knowledge.  Would this requires a change in the switches too?"
networking,3cba2p,ehcanada,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:15:48 2015 UTC,"No problem. On your switching, you would have (at least) two VLANs configured. These VLANs would correspond to the settings on the interface configurations.  interface GigabitEthernet0/1.66  encapsulation dot1Q 66   The 'dot1q 66' bit means 'this traffic belongs to VLAN 66'. If you were to look at the configuration on the switchport that connects to G0/1 on the router, it would be a trunk port (trunk ports can pass traffic for multiple VLANs).  So somewhere on your switching, some ports are configured for VLAN 1, and some ports are configured for VLAN 66. A device with an IP provisioned in that G0/1.1 subinterface (10.33.65. or 10.33.67.) needs to be connected to a port configured as VLAN 1 (to match the router).  A device configured with an IP 10.33.66 likewise needs to be connected to a switchport configured for VLAN 66 (to match the router again). If you take a device configured for 10.33.65.x and put it into a port configured for VLAN 66, you'll have problems. So a device you configure with 10.33.66 needs to be connected to a switchport that is configured for VLAN 66 (basically if you put a 10.33.66 IP on something, and you can't ping 10.33.66.32, the VLANs probably wrong)  To add the config to the router, you'd use:  config t interface GigabitEthernet0/1.66 ip address 10.33.64.32 255.255.255.0 secondary end"
networking,3c9a1c,beardedpacket,2,Mon Jul 6 02:21:04 2015 UTC,Can the switches reach anything in the 192.168.1.x/24 net?  What does the route table on R1 look like?  What is the default gateway for .50?
networking,3c9a1c,noukthx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"Good questions.   Yes, SW1 and SW2 can ping all hosts and interfaces in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. here's a capture of the R1 route table: http://pastebin.com/r9tP7wh9 the DGW for host .50 is currently 192.168.1.1   Thanks."
networking,3c9a1c,noukthx,6,Mon Jul 6 03:01:52 2015 UTC,R1 appears to be 192.168.1.1 from diagram.  R1 route table shows the route for 192.168.2.0 as a static route to itself (192.168.1.1). Doesn't appear to have learned 192.168.2.0 via RIP.  Try removing static route for 192.168.2.0/24 and repointing it to 192.168.1.2 or 192.168.1.3.
networking,3c9a1c,MhughesNP,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:42:30 2015 UTC,Thanks! This worked beautifully and fixed the stress I was experiencing. I had forgotten that I had setup a previous static route on R1 with a different topology. RIPv2 is working like a charm now and SSH/Telnet too.
networking,3c9a1c,noukthx,2,Tue Jul 7 02:19:19 2015 UTC,"I do not think you are using RIP to send routes in this topology. You have two directly connected networks on R2 and R3 (which are the DG for the switches) and you have a static route on R1 for the 192.168.2.0/24 network.  If the RV220W is like any other Cisco router that has a switching module in it then you will need to make a SVI for VLAN 1 on R1 and run RIP on that interface.  Right now, you could turn off RIP and everything would have reachability."

Duplicate ip address on the physical hsrp interface lol  Also from looking at the configurations don't forget to enable preempt on the hsrp routers, it will allow them to check when the primary router has came back up."
networking,3c781l,Totoros_Belly,10,Sun Jul 5 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"The firewall is where you need to do this. One thing, is your server on a public IP, or a private one (10.X.X.X, 192.168.X.X, 172.16-32.X.X). If it is public, you just need the access rule. If it is private, you need to set up NAT as well.   For the Access rule:  Open ASDM, go to the Configuration tab at the top, then click the firewall tab. In Access rules, look for a group called outside. Click in there and hit the button labeled new, then access control entity. This should give you a form. Put source IP as Any, put the destination IP of  your pitboss server, and service as udp/27016. Hit OK, then use the arrow buttons to move this above the deny any any rule that should be in that list.   I have to run, but if you need NAT, I'll check again in a few hours, or someone else can help."

Though if you get the chance to post instructions I'd greatly appreciate it"
networking,3c781l,Geodanah,7,Sun Jul 5 15:24:19 2015 UTC,"To NAT, on the same config and firewall tabs, there is an option called NAT rules on left. Hit that and hit the add button then ""Network Object NAT Rule"". Name your server, select host from the drop down, then enter the server's IP address. In the dropdown NAT section, check the Automatic Address Translation box, then select Static NAT. For the translated IP, hit the list, then pick the interface ""outside"" at the bottom of the list. Then hit the advanced button, and pick source interface inside, destination outside. For service protocol pick udp and use 27016 for both original and translated ports.

networking,3c8m1x,karroplan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:58:41 2015 UTC,Formal education is good but not a requirement in networking.  The biggest problem is that very few universities actually prepare you to be a network engineer so even with your masters you'll be starting at the bottom like everyone else.  In that respect a masters before experience might feel like a waste of time but in the long run most people never get the free time to go back and continue their education so getting it out of the way up front will certainly help you later on.  Another thing you should be ready for emotionally is that networking is a competitive field and you might see a bright kid who dropped out of college join the company and rise through the ranks faster than you.  Don't assume that your degree makes you more valuable or fall into the trap of not continuing to learn things on your own.  The learning process really begins on your first real job.  Build up experience.  Be nice to your peers (not arrogant or condescending).  Once you have 10 years of experience that masters will help a lot in terms of making you more attractive on paper.  It wasn't a waste but it won't become relevant until you have the experience to back it up.

This is only relevant on 10Mbps or 100Mbps networks.  If you do A-A, or B-B, it's a straigth cable, useful for pretty much everything.  If you do A-B, it is a ""crossover"" cable. Before modern card with auto-detect, it was the only way two similar equipment could talk together (pc-pc, switch-switch, router-router). Switches usually had the ""send"" and ""receive"" opposite those of PCs and routers, which meant you could use a straight cable for pc to switch and for switch to router. It also meant you would need a crossover is you didn't use a switch for pc to pc communication.  Now, 99% of interfaces support auto-mdix, which will detect and swap pairs according to what is needed, crossover are not necessary anymore. Inyerfaces running 1000Mbps have this to be able to function, most modern 100Mbps also have this.  With auto-mdix, you can use straight or crossover without issues.

That seems incredibly convoluted when you can just use GeoIP.  A simpler solution would simply be to point netflix.com to the US datacenter in your hosts file if that were the case.
networking,3c4h6f,striata,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:35:08 2015 UTC,"The proxy is necessary because Netflix is checking the source IP against their GeoDB and blocking based on that.  You have to change the source IP, which means you need a proxy."

networking,3c4h6f,striata,29,Sun Jul 5 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"Because the DNS-servers hosting these zones (lets say netflix.com) use a technique called geo-location.  This means that depending on which geographical region the source ip is considered to be located in you will serve different results.  For example maxmind.com is a large provider of such geoip databases.  This gives that if you use a DNS-server in USA as resolver netflix (as an example) authoritive DNS-servers will see that the query comes from a DNS-server who is considered to be in USA.  The reply the neflix DNS-server then provides is an ip to their datacenter in USA.  When the same happens but with a DNS-server in Europe the DNS-server at netflix will see that the query comes from a resolver in Europe and by that reply with the ip to their european datacenter.  On top of this there are other methods to direct customers/clients to the proper datacenter - one of the more common is anycasting.  With anycasting the routingtable will direct the client to the networkwise closest datacenter.  For example both client in USA and Europe got reply to connect to 1.2.3.4. Thanks to anycasting the client in USA will end up in a datacenter in USA while the client in Europe will end up in a datacenter in Europe even if its the same ip.  In netflix case they also use clientbased geolocation, that is their app will do its best to try to figure out which country you are currently located in and based on this use various datacenters. For example running their app in your smartphone the app can find out which country you are in by querying the sim-card information (who will inform which cellstation you are currently speaking to etc).  Other methods involves latency - if the app pings an ip it knows is in USA and get lets say 150ms in reply and then pings an ip in Europe and gets lets say 20ms in reply it can then assume its more likely the app is being runned in Europe and not in USA and by that serve you EU-based content instead of US-based content."
networking,3c4h6f,Apachez,7,Sat Jul 4 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Just to make sure I understood correctly using your same example, the DNS request eventually makes its way to a Netflix DNS server which in turn replies with an address depending on where the request originated (i.e. the DNS server that made the request) to provide the best performance?  So, if I choose a third party DNS server outside the U.S. (let's say Denmark for the sake of example), Netflix will respond with the closest data center to Denmark.  That makes complete sense, I guess I'm just amazed that these billion dollar companies are able to get away with such a simple system within their contractual obligations (e.g. the relationships Netflix has with content producers or the relationships the NFL has with networks like FOX and NBC)."
networking,3c4h6f,Apachez,7,Sat Jul 4 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"Yes you understood it correctly.  Regarding Netflix they have started to use other methods since they are in control of what the client is running so they might be a bad example.  Another method to determine where a client is located (after the initial geo-location through DNS-replies) is to tell the client some random redirect (in 2 or more steps).  If you then measure the time between the first and second query (or rather second and third since the first could already be cached so it never hits the authoritive servers (the ones maintained by Netflix themselfs)) you could then figure out if the client is ""close"" to the DNS-resolver asking the questions.  If so then the client most likely really is in lets say Denmark. But if the time between second and third DNS-query is lets say 200ms or more then the client could very well be elsewhere and you could do further redirects to determine which datacenter the client really is close to (and find out that this client, using DNS-resolvers in Denmark, most likely really is located in USA).  Other methods would be to apply this geo-location for the streaming itself.  A client who only changed the DNS will still use its real IP-address to access the content at the datacenter. The datacenter could then be selective of which content it will provide to which client based on the geo-location of the source ip the client is using.  That is why changing DNS to a US-based DNS-resolver today often doesnt help to get US-based content of Netflix, you need to use a proxy or even better a VPN (the downside with proxy is that with bad DNS-settings you could ""leak"" your true location to Netflix (in terms of which country you are in, a VPN will often be better to fully tunnel ALL requests through that VPN-connection - however be aware of IPv6 leakage when using VPN-tunnels :)  Netflix could also store a record of previous locations like if you use your account in your smartphone (who will leak that you are in Denmark) and 5 seconds later shows up in USA (because you switched DNS-resolver(s) to use) - well, Netflix could then decide to still provide you with Denmark based content.  Also most will use a credit card of some sort to pay the monthly bills from Netflix, through those API's (creditcard stuff) Netflix could also get a location of you (perhaps not current location but regarding which location is your ""home"" location).  https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-providers-respond-to-allegations-of-data-leakage-150701/  There are valid points of using various types of geo-locations, mainly to direct client to the closest datacenter and by that bring the client a better experience (you will get lower latency and higher bandwidth from a DC in your own country than from a country at the other side of the globe) - but personally I feel sad that Netflix is doing all this geolocation against me as a paying customer.  For example if I search for ""Terminator"" in Netflix here in Sweden I get following results:   Terminator (1) Terminator Salvation (4)   So what happend to Terminator 2 (Judgement Day) and Terminator 3 (Rise of the Machines)?"
networking,3c4h6f,Apachez,2,Sat Jul 4 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"Other methods would be to apply this geo-location for the streaming itself   As a (mostly) web programmer this is what I assumed a majority of companies would do.  As requests come in for the stream, simply check the requesting IP and validate its location.  Instead it sounds like some are trying to stay within a gray area of providing just enough effort to check the location of customers.  It seems like Netflix is taking it to another level than some other content providers, likely from pressure from the content producers would be my guess.  Anyway, great responses!"
networking,3c4h6f,jcacedit,2,Sat Jul 4 21:03:28 2015 UTC,Thanks!  In Netflix case I think it could be a combo of attempt to do goodwill (which would mean that they would get more paying customers than if they would be as anal as they have become lately) and technical reasons like less stuff in their code when sending the bits to each client (if the authorization to get the bits is done elsewhere then the servers providing the bits can assume that the client is cleared to get these bits and by that can focus on actually deliver these bits to the clients) but also because you could then better utilize a localized cache.  That is the gigabytes needed to cache (as an example) Terminator 2 and 3 in Nordic (or even European countries) could be better used for some other movies or tv-series because due to DRM T2 and T3 are not to be provided in streaming format for the Nordic/European countries.
networking,3c4h6f,Bruska,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"It's also important to understand that a key element to geo-location is something called recursion.  A DNS server can be configured to perform recursive lookups on behalf of the client, so the authoritative server, which is responding according to geo-location, will see the source IP of the lookup as that of the recursive DNS server and not the IP of the client."
networking,3c4h6f,Apachez,2,Sun Jul 5 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"I wonder if one of the reasons for using this method is the decentralisation of IPv4 addresses.   For example: In the past large blocks of IP addresses were allocated geographically. So if you implemented a simple access list to block 100.0.0.0/8 then you could be sure that all of those addresses were in the same country. And if you so desired you could easily block all foreign IPs. Today, due to the low supply of IPv4 addresses, there is a large 2nd hand market. So now 100.1.0.0/16 might belong to someone in  Spain while 100.2.0.0/16 might belong to someone in Uganda, and the abovementioned access list is no longer effective.   Just a theory..."
networking,3c4h6f,Bruska,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:14:54 2015 UTC,"Na, IANA hands out the large blocks to RIR's such as ARIN (US), RIPE (EU) and the others. Then sure at that level you can see which part of the world the address belongs to - but when you go further in the food chain a company in Sweden could get a range from their LIR who then got it from RIPE which maintains the EU-ranges.  However once this company got this range it can be used wherever they like as long as they announce it along with their AS (they could announce it elsewhere but various methods to protect against BGP leaking could then backfire).  So just because a range is allocated to lets say a EU-based company doesnt mean that it will physically only be used by equipment placed within EU.  So thats why maxmind.com can create, maintain and sell its geoip databases (I think there are others but Maxmind seems to be the giant in this area) so you can get a physical location (sort of) of the IP address and not only to whom its being allocated."

networking,3c4h6f,Newdles,2,Sun Jul 5 19:19:03 2015 UTC,"The reason this might work is due to how the servers figure out what server to send you to. A lot of times this is how CDNs try to get you as close as possible to their local servers. When you make a request for a DNS record like streaming-files-here.cdn.netflix.com you will send that request to your DNS resolver, which will make that request on your behalf. DNS requests aren't sending the IP address of the computer that asked for the record along with the request, so it appears that the DNS request came from whichever resolver you have setup, like google's public DNS resolvers. If you make the request from your ISP's resolvers it may respond to that DNS query with an IP address of a server that resides in your ISP's datacenter, if you instead of google's public DNS resolvers it will respond with an IP that's physically close to their resolvers. I ran into this problem with people getting terrible download speeds from our CDN and the fix was to have them set their DNS resolvers back to their ISP provided servers, or to find a resolver closer to them. There are a number of different methods that can be used to determine where someone is, and none of them are foolproof, but from what you're describing it sounds like that might be what's going on."

The request is still coming from your computer > Your ISP DNS in your geographic location. With a DNS redirector, the service is actually making the request so it appears that they (the service) are making the original request to access the site. This means they make the request to translate the website to IP, not your ISP in your region. They are usually hosting their service in a non-geographically limited country and thus it allows your computer to access the content. Since the geographically limited website sees the request coming from a server in a non-limited country, it allows the request and serves the content.   If deep packet inspection is involved, the site can still see the source of the original request (you) and understand if you are in a geographically limited service area and decide to axe your request. This is why using this method is still not bulletproof. Using a VPN is still generally the best, then proxy, then DNS."
networking,3c4h6f,1RedOne,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:34:36 2015 UTC,"I'm finding a lot of the replies here a bit confusing, so I'll try to give a simple explanation.   When changing dns servers works, the service your accessing is not using one ip as an entry point for their website, put a different ip for every region.   They use dns to determine which ip you should get. So if their dns server gets an address from a dns server in the US, they'll reply with 1.2.3.4, and when an EU dns server asks, it gets 4.5.6.7 as reply.  That allows them to restrict content depending on the server you connect to, instead of on the client you connect with.   By switching dns servers you are changing the server you connect too, so you're also changing the restrictions that apply."
networking,3c4pb9,The_Packeteer,9,Sat Jul 4 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you are using TDM microwaves.  TDM is time division multiplexing which is what you are dealing with when working with T1's.  Most microwaves deployed 10 or more years ago are built for TDM.  Newer style microwaves are often a hybrid IP/Ethernet/TDM system which allows for use of MPLS and other routing and IP based protocols, as well as significantly more bandwidth (on the order of 300mbps per link on most IP/Ethernet deployments I've dealt with) while maintaining backwards compatibility for legacy TDM systems.    The most common ""older"" microwaves out there are motorola CM6's, which are still fully operable and you can still get replacement cards and boards for.  We still have a handful CM6 based links in use.  Until we get them upgraded to higher throughput Ethernet/IP microwaves, we are combining the T1's via RAD T1-Ethernet converter and using them as ethernet paths so we don't have to maintain older T1 CSU/DSU's and routers.  With much of this hardware, your maintenance and use of it will revolve around the ""three R's."" 1. Reset, 2. Reseat, 3. Replace.  First, try to reset the radios, they may just have locked up.  Second, power down the radios, reseat the boards and/or cards and all connections, and then power back up.  Third, if you can identify a board, card, or other component as the problem, then replace it.   Most of your problems will be resolved with one or more of those steps.  You can usually get contracts for emergency board replacement from RF specialty suppliers.  Alarm and indicator lights will often point you in the right direction (power supply, synchronization, whether the primary or secondary SPU (signal processing unit) is in use, whether the primary or diversity antenna is in use).  A volt meter will become your friend.  If you have no alarm lights and you are having problems, attempt the three R's.  If problems persist, you may need to call in help from an RF engineer, preferably the one who installed it.  Most companies or agencies that use microwaves maintain a ""crash kit"" which contains the most commonly needed replacement boards, a splice kit for waveguide (special hollow cable that propagates a gigahertz signal from the inside of the building, up the tower, and into the dish - not all microwaves use waveguide, and you shouldn't attempt to splice it without training and experience), a few waveguide flex pieces (the waveguide equivalent of patch cords, flexible pieces for the last few feet of connection), spare DC fuses, spare DC power supply hardware, etc.  The hard part of microwaves is not the maintenance, it is the planning and initial deployment of new microwave links and hardware.  There is no quick learning guide for that.  It's best to seek out a proper RF solutions company for that.  Often times they will do the pre-planning and engineering for reduced cost or free as part of the process of obtaining the sale for the total wireless solution.  It is a large undertaking, requiring a path survey (actually walking the proposed path, evaluating tree and building heights, looking for obstructions or reflection points) a properly filled-out FCC frequency license application, math, physics, and tons of experience.  Also, most microwaves allow for management through a serial port and basic CLI, or proprietary software, this will tell you things like the status of synchronization between endpoints as well as the Received Signal Strength, etc.  Some newer microwaves have IP based management access (usually through SNMP or a proprietary communications protocol).  Additional Tips from Experience:  -Channel Banks - Worth the money for good ones.  I have had decent success with Adtran hardware.  -T1's - get a quickBERT tester.  You may have to get one from ebay as they might be discontinued  -If you replace a board and your alarm lights on the microwave go away but your channel bank still has an alarm on the T1 interface, you may need to go into the CLI or management software of the microwave and change the framing of the T1's because replacement boards might have shipped with a different default setting.  -I have never seen a properly installed microwave dish on a properly maintained tower/structure get knocked out of alignment by any storm or event including greater than 85mph winds and ice storms.  So unless the dish is literally hanging by it's waveguide or laying on the ground, it's almost certainly not the alignment.  Since tower climbs are expensive, you should exhaust all other options before scheduling a climb to examine the alignment."

The book I think costs about 50 bucks and is a great at explaining theory without getting too deep into the math.  It's also a good basis for learning about electronics.

networking,3c3kb9,nativevlan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on the security level you wish to achieve.  Obvious downsides:   Traffic will compete over the linkspeed where all your VLANs must squeeze into. If you misconfigure something then a single error can cause you to open up way too much (for example mixing VLAN traffic who shouldnt be mixed). A software bug in the appliance you use can do the same (for example mixing VLAN traffic who shouldnt be mixed). A hardware bug in the appliance you use can do the same (for example mixing VLAN traffic who shouldnt be mixed). A not to uncommon drawback, specially if you use a single unit for everything, is what happens the day you get a DDoS against your internetuplink? The first device will most likely suffer or even die (while the DDoS lasts) - then what?   So using two boxes (even if you only got two interface like one WAN and one LAN) where one acts as internet-firewall and the other as internal-firewall will overcome this situation by design.  Personally I think that you can use VLAN for the same type of information being handled. Lets say you got three interfaces on your router so one is WAN, one is LAN and one is DMZ. Then the DMZ could be divided into several VLANs (because you shouldnt keep any sensitive data on your internetfacing DMZ, right? ;-)"
networking,3c3kb9,Apachez,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"I do exactly this with our ASAs... easy to setup as many sub-interfaces as licensing allows for various DMZ security needs. To the firewall, they're all just separate zones. As long as you don't exceed available bandwidth/pps of the physical interface there shouldn't be a problem.  The only time I can think something like this wouldn't be kosher is if you had something like a PCI compliance issue where your traffic has to be physically separate."

All your devices come up on the same network.   Granted what other people posted here like good host security practices will likely prevent issues nothing beats physical separation.   Consider the application.  Home lab probably ok.  Probably not what you want to do for a PCI compliant network (a guess).   [EDIT]  loses its config:  When a device is reset to defaults.    In the rare case this may happen this could end up with all devices sitting on the same network. Most switches default to all ports on the same network with no VLAN's.

Then it gets approved by MY manager, who will submit an emergency change request, and he will assign it to me. Then, YOU have to hunt down an incident manager in an opposing timezone, who will call it out to the NOC, who I have trained well to look at the ticket, and if it's not something they already know how to fix or implement, they will tell the incident manager to hunt YOU down because there isn't enough info in the ticket for me to not roll over and go back to sleep.

Give an example of a case study, like a hypothetical/real network and discuss solutions?  It may work in a forum-type setting, in my opinion those are better for blogs as industry best practices usually dictate one or two ideal solutions with commentary.  Definitely good ideas on the wiki side regarding a FAQ.  For the OC, to be frank these items are what I've spent countless hours on and bring value to my employer and customers.  Anyone can do this reading whitepapers and datasheets.  Its part of the industry and a necessary step in any engineer's career path.  Mainly its a large time sink to maintain and would be in constant flux.  I'd rather build out my own comparisons than being handed to me as then I have a deeper understanding of the platforms.  Also, none of the 'throughput' averages that the vendors put out can be taken at face value and I would hate to steer others or be steered in the wrong direction.  Its usually difficult to compare vendor offerings apples-to-apples."
networking,3c0eu0,l0c0d0g,6,Fri Jul 3 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"I think I the weekly Monday 'Junior Guys Ask Anything' is a great idea, well at least better then my idea.  Much more realistic then asking people to get on skype, and should help cutdown on the chatter.   Case Study examples. I just implemented Vmware NSX, this is how I designed it, here are the issues I ran into. I just converted an all mpls WAN to a IPSEC over Internet WAN, my cost went down X, my reliability was X greater/lower, and this is how I step migrated to the new design.    Anyone can do this reading whitepapers and datasheets.    I'd love to find those whitepapers :) It took me months to get a specific vendor to answer QoS questions, never mind it being in a whitepaper or datasheet.    none of the 'throughput' averages that the vendors put out can be taken at face value   That's the point, I can't trust the vendor's info, plus they only tell me that they support, not what they don't support. So when doing vendor to vendor bake off I have to build my own structure, which is fine, but it would be nice to have a jump off point. I do not expect this to be a one stop shop to make a decision, just a one stop show to do a base comparison.  It will also be nice to be able to get basic information about Vendors you don't use. I have no idea what HP, Dell's, Avaya switch platform looks like, but I be someone here does."

Personally, a weekly discussion would be great on the regular topics, a free for all if you will.  After that, a regular moderation and removal of repeated content is something I would support.

I don't think we should demonize folks asking for career advice. Of course they could usually get answers from the search function and it does become a bit redundant, but if by them making their own thread and getting their own answer they are able to advance in their career or become a better engineer than the annoyance seems worth it to me.   The idea of a detailed wiki would be difficult to maintain just because of how often certifications and resources change.  I post here fairly often asking for folk's opinions on a topic or asking technical questions. Of course there are probably very few questions I couldn't find the answer to in a white paper or cisco press book, but I rely on the community here to help me streamline my research and in return I try and respond to questions in areas that I am confident in.  I've always viewed /r/networking as a forum where networkers and aspiring networkers can help each other out in a casual fashion as well as have some discussions about the industry. If you delete redundant posts you've killed a big chunk of that.  If you don't like a career question downvote it. Reddit is sort of based on the self-moderating function of the voting matrix. There is no reason for the mods to reign with an iron fist when the community can just click the down arrow and bury the post.  More active mods in general would be nice though."

Once routes are in the routing table, longest match always wins."

networking,3c1i2w,jm493,4,Sat Jul 4 01:44:50 2015 UTC,"I recommend you go back to your ISP and tell them that you need more than a /64.  Giving out a /64 via DHCPv6-PD is only suitable if you are absolutely sure there will be no downstream routers, e.g. using your cellular phone to create an IPv6-enabled WiFi hotspot for your laptop.  Home networks can need internal routers e.g. for keeping multicasts away from WiFi, or as gateways to home automation networks. As such, a home should get a /56.  Small businesses should ask for a /48.  A /56 might do, but if you expand, you don't want to have to renumber.  IPv6 addresses are amazingly abundant, and amazingly cheap, so it makes sense to allocate them generously to avoid wasting people time later if you run out of subnets."
networking,3c1i2w,Apachez,2,Sat Jul 4 06:28:52 2015 UTC,I agree on that.  We hand out one /64 per private customer along with a routable /56 per customer (out of which the DHCP6-PD picks its /64's from).  And enterprise/commercial customer (aka not private customer) should get a /48 by default.  A better option is to aquire your own /48 but then you need an ASN aswell which will cost a bit more than just get this from your current ISP - on the other hand if you want 2 or more ISPs doing your own ASN and having your own range(s) will be so much easier.

I had thought the same as you - that the Requesting Router (""Router A"" in your diagram) would be able to further delegate some of the prefixes it had received on to Router B.  But the RFCs only talk about your ""Router A"", and when that requests multiple prefixes it uses one for each of its multiple LAN interfaces.

If you're certain it will work, I would be willing to try a switch in place of router B, but it doesn't sound like they'll pass through IPv6 from what I've read.

Essentially the upstream router just needs to do the same things that its upstream router (the ISP's) does: assign an IP and route a subnet. To the downstream router, it looks no different to being plugged into the ISP directly.  Of course, in order to do this, you need more than one /64, and if your ISP doesn't provide that then they've fucked up.

It's certainly not 100%, but it's pretty amazing what all the various teams have accomplished. They've been working on it for years, though. Of course, it's still a process. There are pockets without v6 and plenty of devices in the network that just don't support it, but that is rapidly changing.

The RIRs do, but only for address blocks they have authority over. ARIN can't withdraw an allocation made by RIPE NCC - that wouldn't make sense. ARIN can't withdraw the legacy IPv4 blocks held by Apple, etc, because ARIN was never responsible for those address blocks to begin with, nor was IANA.

Public IP address space is demonstrably of financial value to an organisation. Government bodies unilaterally deciding to take items of value from an organisation without legal basis tend not to do well in court.

As far as the consumer is concerned, where ipv6 is needed is at the router level as assigned by our ISPs (cable/DSL box), or on any device that has a need to have a static IP on the internet.

But it's also possible that the AP won't be happy with 10-11v when the battery is partially discharged.  I guess I'm not exactly suggesting a raw battery is the right way to go. But more to give you an idea of what is possible with better batteries (the unit you linked used heavy lead acid cells, which kind of suck).  edit: actually LiFePO4 batteries have a really flat discharge curve and this will probably work well, assuming the APs will work off a 12v power adapter."

Spanning tree is a nightmare around diverse paths, you really want to route diversity unless the paths are very straighforward.  Personally, I'd consider this:   each stack is switches. Each stack connects the top back to one of your 3750, bottom back to the other 3750. You will need a top-bottom loop within the stack too. The 3750 core is routed. Then run VRRP on both 3750 to each VLAN on that stack.   The aim here is to be able to kill any one item of equipment and continue to operate for all bar the unfortunates directly connected to that item of equipment.   You will need multiple VLANs on a stack (eg, to force people through a print gateway, or to run phones out of the main subnet so configuring their QoS is simpler).   This approach has the nice attribute of only requiring the more expensive license on the 3750s."

From what you described I would go for L2 equipment and enable protected vlan, dhcpsnooping, option82, DAI, IP source guard etc.  Every L2 switch would then become one VLAN (if we speak IPv4).  For client-VLANs use 1xxx and for server-VLANs use 2xxx (or the other way around, whatever floats your boat ;-)  This way you get the most segmentation of your network but at the same time dont waste ip-addresses.  Other option is to simply use one VLAN per client but the drawback is that you will waste ip-addresses (not that it matters if you use RFC1918 and only got 350'ish clients but still).  One workaround for that wasting part is if you at your L3 device (the core/dist-router) use private vlans.  Also dont forget IPv6 while you are at it - with IPv6 you can easily do one VLAN per client (so each client sits in its own /64 which will be a great mitigation against most of the MITM shit you otherwise will encounter while using IPv6)."

Current IBGP topography has two routers acting as route reflectors, and originating OSPF defaults. All IBGP sessions over loopbacks as per best practice. Four edge routers, all run IBGP sessions with the route reflectors.  I use communities to control route distribution. Some primary ones differentiate internal routes, transit routes, customer routes, and peer routes. I use those to control which routes go to which peers, and if the route doesn't have one of those tags it won't get announced to any EBGP peer.  I then have communities for each transit and peer session that allows for prepending, only announcing to the to that peer, not announcing to that peer, and/or adding no-export when announcing to the peer.  Since our network isn't very geographically diverse, I have the route reflectors generate bgp routes for our aggregate prefixes and use route policies to tag them as needed.  I do some default local prefs based on peer * Transit is the usual 100 * Peers are 110 * Customers are 120 * Our own prefixes are 200  I do have some communities that allow our transit customers to manipulate localpref, but to a limited range and I don't think any of them use it right now.  Also, I strip any overlapping communities on ingest, allowing for customers to do the route manipulation communities only and not the ""origin"" communities. Other sessions like peer or transit have the entire overlapping community space stripped, and then an origin community is added.  Some of the community stuff was borrowed from a previous engineers design, though the original setup was confederation hell which as described I replaced with route reflectors.

networking,3bxvli,The_Packeteer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"How come and why not the other way around, OSPF-free core?"
networking,3bxvli,Apachez,2,Fri Jul 3 03:34:54 2015 UTC,"MPLS on top of an IGP like ospf or IS-IS is the best design. BGP in the core can just cause a lot of inefficiency with tables and forwarding.   Some people get confused about BGP. BGP is a routing protocol technically speaking,  but the reason it exists is to function as an application running on top of your IGP (which is why it uses TCP 179 and not it's own protocol like ospf) so you can enforce policies and seperate link - state domains when peering with another AS. It also has some plug-ins like MP BGP which are important."
networking,3bxvli,The_Packeteer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:22:07 2015 UTC,"I know that the basic idea of BGP is to exchange routes between AS's and not necessary ipranges but at the same time you have this private AS ranges you can use and to me BGP is a better option than OSPF with its ""everything goes to area 0"" design.  Do you perhaps got some recommended reading on this topic that is BGP vs OSPF/IS-IS for IGP (presentations or speaks or such)?"
networking,3bxvli,Apachez,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:49:05 2015 UTC,There are very few situation where BGP should be used as the IGP.
networking,3bxvli,The_Packeteer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:42:17 2015 UTC,Any good reason for running BGP-free core ?
networking,3bxvli,amar-c,2,Fri Jul 3 05:55:06 2015 UTC,"Generally, you don't use BGP as your only IGP. It simply wasn't designed for that purpose. BGP is an application, you need a proper IGP to learn the internal topology.  So you are going to have to run an IGP like OSPF/IS-IS/EIGRP regardless. Having to run BGP on every device as well adds complexity. Most designs that use a lot of BGP, such as Service provider MPLS networks, use BGP only on the edge of the network (PE routers)."
networking,3bxvli,100BASE-TX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:51:39 2015 UTC,it's painful to have every node run a BGP peering to every other node.   i'm a fan of IS-IS as an IGP
networking,3bxvli,beefknuckle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:03:28 2015 UTC,I probably need to read up on IS-IS. All the network I build I use OSPF because I don't know IS-IS very well.   Do you recommend any books specifically on IS-IS?

networking,3buzcs,noreallyimthepope,8,Sat Jul 4 10:07:44 2015 UTC,"We were looking at leasing a building for a branch to move into.  The ""decommissioning team"" from the previous bank that was in there took the ""Dumbass Scorched Earth"" approach.  They cut the ends off of all visible network cables, but left the rat's nest in the ceilings.  The teller equipment had the combination cards taped to all of them and it takes roughly 10 seconds to open one, but they're all destroyed with crowbar marks all over them... a process which I'm guessing took considerably more time than just opening the damn locks.  The room that had the 2 post telco rack... they cut the studs off with about 5 threads protruding from the floor.  It's not enough to do anything with as far as mounting or even trying to extract, but just enough for people to trip over.  And the security cameras, they just cut the cables off (power and video) and left them there.  The power bricks are still attached to the wall in some of the places where they had to just run it up to the camera.... because I guess taking the screw out that holds the power brick to the faceplate was too difficult for them.  On the bright side, they weren't able to meet the negotiated terms of the contract thanks to them destroying everything in sight.... so we're getting a few months knocked off of the rent.  More than enough to pay for nice new teller line hardware."

I could see the LL letting the next tenant run their own additional temporary cables if needed    OR  pay an extra monthly  fee For the option to: rent access to the LL's  cabling rack with all the ports  installed by previous tenant  and install any additional permanent cabling if needed.  Not a huge monthly fee (less than the cost in materials and labor of the next tenant hiring a company to cable everything up  with the temporary cabling  and no permanent modifications to the building/no changes to fixtures or holes in the walls   allowed option)."

networking,3buzcs,Draco1200,5,Thu Jul 2 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"Hey wait a minute...  I was talking about the choice keeping the patch panels VS requiring the exiting tenant to remove the patch panels,   not the choice of  allowing old cabling to stay VS  forcing tenant to remove crappy old cabling they installed.  Removing the patch panels with scissors is not ripping anything out; it's about  10 minutes worth of cheap labor.      At least the old cables can be useful as  ""pull string""  to avoid having to fish walls.  Cabling lasts longer than 10 years.   When was the last time you expected to rent Office space,  with no Electrical or Telephone cabling installed?  Who was running CAT3 cabling for network in 2005?"

Mobile VPNs are used in environments where workers need to keep application sessions open at all times, throughout the working day, as they connect via various wireless networks, encounter gaps in coverage, or suspend-and-resume their devices to preserve battery life. A conventional VPN cannot survive such events because the network tunnel is disrupted, causing applications to disconnect, time out,[1] fail, or even the computing device itself to crash.[2] Mobile VPNs are commonly used in public safety, home care, hospital settings, field service management, utilities and other industries.[3] Increasingly, they are being adopted by mobile professionals and white-collar workers.[2]"

The best thing you can get out of it is the framework to pick up a book on something and work towards learning it on your own.  Most network degrees look something like: a CCNA program, an English course or two, a math course, a random Microsoft course, a random Linux one, sometimes a scripting or programming course, a business course, and a bunch of filler like history  or such.   What about that screams valuable? Like you say there are a ton of lazy students who cheat their way through assignments by relying on their group or posts to reddit.   Even if the student isn't lazy what does him/her getting a B in VoIP class really mean to an employer? How much does the student really remember? What voice solution was it? Did they ever lab anything or just listen to the instructor?  Compare that to someone with his CCNA, if they are a CCNA I can instantly judge him at at least a CCNA level since I know what's in that exam and I can very easily tell if he is legit. Certs also show interest and career direction on his part since in school you have to take that wireless class but if you take a wireless cert then that means your interested in that technology.

You'd like to make the field harder to enter, so that it's easier for you to get a job, because you don't like competing against people who might be better at the job than you, but don't hold a degree.  A better question would be why do so many other fields require a degree, not why does networking not.  Also, I've never even seen a college that offers any sort of bachelors degree in networking. Lots of 2 year schools do (which is where I went, and am close to having a BA too but not in IT). CS is the closest thing offered at most schools, and there is very little carry over that would be useful."

Mostly this irritates me due to firewalls that are layer-2 adjacent to the app switches and run VRRP; they set the source MAC of traffic to the interface and not the VRRP MAC, and so when they fail-over the sessions stay on the ""failed"" firewall and eventually time out on the F5. In that regards I could just as easily complain about the firewalls' selection of source MAC and their insistence on symmetric routing.

Another good example is multiple internet connections. If a SYN comes in on ISP1, the response must go back through ISP1. If it comes on ISP2, it goes out ISP2.

Right now I'm leaning toward SGT, but there's a few things that make me uneasy about it:   Lots of moving parts -- You define the policy in Cisco ISE, and devices talk to ISE and download the policy from it.  If a device doesn't support inline tagging, you need SXP, but different devices support different versions of SXP.  An SXP implementation in itself requires careful architecture/traffic flow considerations How stable/reliable is ISE? How seemless will devices interact with ISE? I've used it for wireless AAA and the BYOD flow.  Outside of self-inflicted issues, I haven't had any issues.  However, my implementation is child's play compared to what it can do Enterprise-wide hardware and device software consideration.  If inline tagging isn't supported on a device, you have to check if the software supports SXP The concept of identity-based access control still seems very new.  I could be wrong   I'm unsure of EVN either as it also doesn't seem widely deployed and seems more fitted to separate traffic, not enforce security policy.  I'd need to funnel the traffic to a firewall to impose security traffic, but then I have to consider a centralized vs decentralized firewall architecture which opens a can of worms in itself.  On the other hand, with EVN being based on VRF-Lite (I could be wrong here too), I'll have more online documentation and concepts to reference if needed"

We use Mikrotik only at solar sites due to low power requirements.    I posted in here a while back about an alternative to Mikrotik, and got a lot of recommendations for either a Cisco/Juniper.  I ultimately went with a Cisco ASR.    I don't trust the Mikrotik under load.  We had an x86 i7 that'd reboot when it hit more than 1 million PPS.  A few of our customers seem to be magnets for DDoS attacks, and our core router would die every time from too many PPS.  I don't care what Mikrotik says the router can do.  I've seen them fail under less than their specs say.  Their cloud core router is probably the best of the bunch, but again, I don't trust them.  I know I'm going against most of the WISP culture by not liking Mikrotik, but I've had too many failures to be comfortable at any site that pushes more than 150mbit.  As far as 10G, when we turned up our 10G we put a CCR1036-8G-2S+ as the core during testing.  They said it'd be able to route like 34 million PPS @ 64 byte  no rules/firewall or some bullshit like that.  It freaked out around 5.5Gbit and stopped communicating on the SFP+ interface.    I just wish Cisco/Juniper would become more WISP friendly.  If they were, we'd be an entire Cisco shop.  And in response to /u/the-packet-thrower  I totally agree, when you have a problem a phone number is a life saver.  I don't speak Latvian and their forum responses are a joke.  edit: forgot words."
networking,3bv0kr,doomcrewinc,2,Thu Jul 2 17:47:50 2015 UTC,Working for a fiber/wireless NSP using Juniper gear.  I was wondering how Cisco or Juniper can become more WISP friendly? Are you referring to the pricing or the product/software?
networking,3bv0kr,ep0niks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"They can do 2 things.  1: Pricing -- Way too expensive to deploy at all of our tower sites.  2: Wattage/Voltage -- Many tower sites run off DC, and when you're using solar to charge your batteries, every watt counts.  We can't buy enough batteries to power up a inverter and a cisco, let alone enough solar to charge it constantly.  We could add in wind power, but that's expensive and oddly enough in our neck of the woods not terribly reliable.  Its either no wind, or too damn windy."

One difference is we're a metro NSP so our wireless gear is usually on AC in big buildings with UPS and fuel generators and even dual utility power feeds. Different realities!  I do agree about the pricing but it really depends what you actually need. Any routing can be done cheaply-ish depending on your level of traffic. We actually deploy Layer3 PoPs (again, different realities) with small-ish routers (SRX and ACX series) that can scale from 100Mbps to easily 10Gbps of traffic and mix with Ubiquiti's EdgeMax switches that can feed the Ubiquiti AF5, 5x and 24 radios with PoE+.

networking,3bv0kr,doomcrewinc,5,Fri Jul 3 01:41:01 2015 UTC,"Also a WISP here. Completely Mikrotik based for all routing.  I've got a few i5 Based X86 boxes running our BGP edge (Maxxwave I5). The most loaded of the group does ~800Mb/s aggregate. Handful of firewall rules. Avg CPU load is ~21%. Under DDoS, I've seen it pass linerate 1Gb/s on Four interfaces (3x Transit, 1x 10gb to our core) at ~1.5M PPS aggregate. CPU load was ~62%. So it did quite well. And that's with firewall rules.  I'll note that the Cloud Core router directly behind that BGP router was at a much lower (~4%) cpu load. Being that it has no firewall rules, No rate limiting..etc. Just straight MPLS Switching.  I'd be comfortable deploying it to handle 1-2 10Gb/s feeds. Anything more than that is just a little outside of the realm of the hardware at the moment. But as Mikrotik implements more things like Fast Path/Fast Track. That will change.  I'd say the only cons are all software related. While we don't work with much other routing gear. Router OS has a few tiny bugs that absolutely infuriate me just because they're a pain in my ass. In an environment like ours. Where configs are constantly changing as we turn up new things..etc. You've got a lot more space to see these tiny bugs. If your deployment would be more of a ""set and forget"" scenario.

networking,3bv0kr,icankickyouhigher,2,Thu Jul 2 21:17:58 2015 UTC,"It won't handle 10Gbps. We've got one at a conference site which maxes out at about 5Gbps of IPv4 NAT. So it's best to think about the 10Gbps interface as actually being a >1Gbps interface.  But, and here's the but, name me one other device around the $1K mark which will do NAT at 5Gbps.  The trick with Mikrotik (and all vendors) is to play to its strengths. It's not a great replacement for a core router, as small packet performance is poor. Routing protocol support looks good, but you can't push that to the limit the same way you can as code from the larger vendors. Personally I wouldn't put anything at a network core which didn't have dual hot-swap power supplies and hitless in-service software upgrade, or some way of simulating that.  It seems to me that the competition for Mikrotik is VM routers on x86. There's some nice stuff there.  At some point the OpenFlow switches will allow a VM router on a x86 to control line-rate forwarding hardware in a way which a normal network engineer can configure. And then -- bang a gong, it is on -- there will be an almighty shake-out at the low end. But that's still a way down the road if you are buying a router today. It's more to say that setting a long-term low-end router strategy at the moment is a little pointless, just use them tactically with a short pay-back period."

networking,3bwgt0,MinimusNadir,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:52:34 2015 UTC,"Yes passive is the prefered one and if your firewall doesnt get the concept of FTP you would need to statically open up the portrange you define for the datachannel of FTP to use.  With passive its the client who will setup the TCP session towards the server, one session for command channel (the login and other commands such as dir etc) and one session for data channel (sending the filelist, sending/receiving files etc).  If you use FTPS you will need to open up this partrange statically anyway because even if you got a firewall who understands FTP (and dynamically open up for the datachannel the server instructed the client to use) the firewall wont see which port will be used for the datachannel when you do explicit/implicit FTPS."

networking,3bx2wu,Newdles,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:54:08 2015 UTC,You have to configure the AP. I'm assuming you don't have enterprise gear or a wireless controller. You need to log into your access point upstairs and configure it to broadcast your SSID. It's not automatic.

Meraki can handle IPsec 3rd party VPN connections.  Call Meraki support if you want assistance setting it up, that is a good question though regarding 'dynamic' vs 'static'.  Do they have to use a dynamic gateway since Meraki would support static.  I read the Azure doc, basically they are trying to peer over the tunnel and send dynamic routing updates through the tunnel instead of a static IPsec prefix mapping.  Worth asking Meraki if they support this before buying new hardware, otherwise I'd get a small peering router like a Cisco ISR 2921/4331 solely for this purpose.  You can even do it virtually with a CSR1000v and the adequate licensing."
networking,3bvno6,pmormr,2,Thu Jul 2 16:19:42 2015 UTC,They actually just added a config preset in their 3rd party VPN specifically for AWS and Azure. It's super easy to set up now.

As mentioned, the Meraki site-to-site settings now include an Azure preset that does it in about 2 clicks. The problem is it only works for static Azure gateways and they have significant limitations. You can only connect to them with one tunnel making point-to-site and vnet-to-vnet connections impossible.

As long as you have the L3 Meraki switches, you can redistribute the VPN routes on the ISR's into OSPF that will be peered with the Meraki devices.  If L2 Meraki's, then you'll have to build some VLAN's with static routing for those VPN routes."

Good thing about the new 4k routers is that the Mbps throughput spec'd in the datasheet is consistent with all features enabled, so no additional hit for IPsec or services (look under 'Aggregate Throughput'):  http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/4000-series-integrated-services-routers-isr/datasheet-c78-732542.html  That is contrasted with the G2 routers like the 3900's where you'd have to look up throughput reports that detail IPsec traffic and then cut by half for bi-directional flows."
networking,3bvno6,cooldude919,2,Thu Jul 2 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"Nope, not totally, which is extra shitty on cisco's part.  See here.  http://miercom.com/pdf/reports/20130605.pdf  Page 1 and 2 are most interesting.  4451 with 2gb license can only do 1625mbit ipsec, and it gets worse the more features you add.  What everyone needs to realize is the throughput limit is not a guaranteed minimum, it is only a guaranteed maximum.  Yes you are more likely to get more throughput with more services than in the past, but its still not great.  Because of this we are moving away from cisco, most likely to fortinet.  Cisco does two things on the new 4k series, they have an artificial shaper in the router to limit the throughput, if you run few enough services to even be able to hit that limit.  Next they intentionally shut of cores of the cpu on the lower throughput license limit on the box, and unlock those cores when you upgrade to the max license on the box.  Also dont forget you still have to license sec, voice, etc, and all the other ios feature sets as before."

One of fortinet's things is they used their own custom asic along with a general cpu, i was able to do 600mbit (it could do more) of ipsec and it was all in the asic.  In the pricing i spec'd out, including support/maintenance on both, fortigate was between 1/2 and 1/3 of the price when compared to cisco.  That included fortigate with all the UTM features which cisco didnt include, which you may not need for your use case, so it may be even cheaper.  TL;DR Id look at fortinet.

For a solid all-in-one package, grab a Cisco ISR G2 2911/2921 router and add a fiber and copper switch module to it.  That will handle everything you've asked, security handled with zone-based firewall.  The 3900 series will give you more module space if needed.  To save some money, get the previous ISR G1 generation so 2800/3800, these are end-of-life so no TAC support.  Otherwise, grab a smaller edge router/firewall and buy an additonal L2 switch like a 2960-X or a 3750-X/3850 for fiber to provide adequate port space.

But encrypting all packets between two sites isn't usually hard (unless NAT comes into play, and needn't be expensive. A couple hundred dollars gets you a gigabit-speed IPSec terminator."

One of the companies I'm doing work for implemented IWAN with dual internet providers, from a single MPLS provider network, and increased their bandwidth dramatically.  They still managed to save money, and had comparable reliability.  If they had done hybrid WAN, Cisco's recommended implementation is to use DMVPN on both the MPLS and the Internet link since you would then be able to control the routing protocols easier.   Another benefit of DMVPN is it makes it a little more difficult for a bad actor in your MPLS network to do traffic pattern analysis.  Since the IP headers are encrypted as well, you would not be able to see that two end nodes are communicating, only that two sites are.  It's probably not that big of a deal most of the time, but some industries are really touchy about that."

Either because we have private data and are contractually obliged to protect it, or because the SP didn't support the features we wanted (ie. IPv6 and multicast). With the data protection side it's not just encrypting the data but authorizing access (so an SP misconfiguration will not give people routes to our servers). It's usually cheap to accomplish, with the only real cost being routers/firewalls at the branch that can do this (instead of just basic L3 switches), and that's not so much the cost of encryption as much as it's the cost of tunneling. It also puts you in the position of being able to migrate to running your VPN over the Internet very easily if the business requirements change.  That being said, if your WAN circuits are more than 100Mbps, the cost of encryption can start to go up quickly; choose your vendor and products wisely.

You can think of it this way:  If you (and the rest of the company incl. CEO, CTO etc) are fine with that everything you sent over this WAN-link shows up at Piratebay then you will be just fine without any encryption - but if not, well then its time to encrypt the stuff being sent (preferly by a high assurance link crypto).  And if the data you are about to send over the link is considered RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP SECRET then you have comsec regulations you must follow (normally in terms of which encryption devices who are ok to use, who is allowed to create the cipher keys being used along with routines for education and administration of the devices and keys etc).  A common prevarication is that using link encryption is expensive so better let each end system do the encryption for you... well in reality having each system do the encryption for themselfs is far more expensive to handle and maintain over time (along with cpu intense) than to use a link crypto (who's only work in life is to encrypt/decrypt packets or frames). Not to mention that end-to-end encryption, specially if not being under some sort of assurance, can be broken. Just take the past years bugs in OpenSSL as an example where end-to-end encryption could be broken.  Having that said you should still evaluate what needs to be further encrypted even within your DC in order to protect you from insiders (among network people and what not). The tricky part here could be that in order to have your IDS and/or IPS do its work the data flows within the DC should be unencrypted."

You should pass BGP prefixes from your downstream customers to your upstreams/peers and back, but never from upstream to upstream or peer to peer (or any combination thereof) - otherwise those networks will try to pass traffic to each other through your network. Well-run ISPs will have prefix filters in place to prevent this (both outbound to their upstreams and inbound from their downstreams).   So what happened today was that Axcelx, a small hosting provider in Boston, had a peer with Amazon Web Services, and didn't filter the prefixes they received from AWS on the outbound peer to their upstream ISP, Hibernia. Hibernia, for their part, didn't have downstream filters in place from Axcelx, so they accepted the route, causing anyone connected to Hibernia's network (and some other peering networks) to attempt to reach Amazon though Axcelx - which Axcelx clearly didn't have the bandwidth for. Hence, all those packets dropped on the floor, taking Reddit and a number of other websites with it. A coworker of mine actually alerted Amazon to the problem - he knows a high-level network guy there pretty well, so he was able to just make a phone call - and Amazon shut down the peer to Axcelx, stopping the traffic from going through them and restoring service."

networking,3bsoaq,bryanc1,6,Wed Jul 1 20:48:41 2015 UTC,"Look into VSS, two chassis then gives you geographical redundancy with active/active L2 links.  What happens to your one core chassis if the building goes down?  Only downside of VSS is a shared management plane, so bugs can still crop up.  Ideally, you'd have two core devices in two separate buildings with L3 routed load-balancing links from your closets/buildings.  Otherwise, yes a single chassis with dual-SUP, dual-power supply is ample for most applications.  1RU core L3 switches like 4500-X are also solid if you don't need a full chassis worth of 10 gig uplinks.  The 4500-X do VSS as well."

Sure, bugs are a pain on any platform, but when it comes to VSS vs VPC, I'll take VSS any day. VPC has so many caveats on how you have to run things it isn't funny. VSS? set it up and it just works. No restrictions on L2 + L3 in the environment. No limitations based on the platform - complete differences on N5K vs N7K.  VSS is pretty well worked out and stable. You're better off with 2 single-sup chassis in a VSS than doing anything VPC. Nexus is a load of crap they're packaging up with a bow."
networking,3bsoaq,Rex9,2,Thu Jul 2 01:18:26 2015 UTC,"VSS and vPC are similar technologies but harder to compare since they are meant for different parts of the network, converged access for vPC and core networking for VSS.  That line is blurring now with the N9k.  With vPC the two Nexus devices still have separate management planes while supporting active/active L2.  VSS is active/active L2 but shared management across two linked devices, some potential for a bug to take down both devices simultaneously from a management plane.  IOS-XE helps in mitigating this running the separate daemons for services.  L3 works fine with VSS but best practice would dictate skipping VSS and using the two devices as separate management planes to alleviate a point-of-failure.  That's how we've deployed 6880's and 4500-X's at the L3 core.  If they were L2 distribution, then VSS would be preferred.

That's how we've deployed 6880's and 4500-X's at the L3 core.   Would you mind explaining a little more? I recently worked on a pair of 6880's as core switching using VSS for redundancy and it seemed to work well - had some fun testing VSS and I was impressed at how quickly it was able to handle the active switch failure.

If it is L2 up to the VSS switches with L3 SVI's then using VSS is the preferred topology for those 6880's.  Using multi-chassis port-channels, that would be the active/active alternative to HSRP as well as shared management.  If your closets/buildings connect to the core switches via /30 routed links (routed at the access/distro layer), then VSS isn't necessary or recommended unless a single management plane is truly preferred.  From a resiliency standpoint, it would be better to separate the management planes and not utilize VSS for a fully-L3 core setup."

A very insignificant cost when you are talking $50-75K. Chassis failure is very rare, but in my 17 year career I've witnessed it twice. I also have another argument against VSS or similar tech in the core. Yes you have all redundant hardware but I've seen a seasoned engineer go a ""no router eigrp 1"" by accident and nuke an entire site.

networking,3budon,ricochetintj,3,Thu Jul 2 05:55:02 2015 UTC,This sounds like co-channel interference (APs on the same channel).   Turn the power level down on each AP.  Try 14 or 15 dBm.  Most mobile devices only transmit at this power level and you don't want a large gap between the the AP and client transmit power. Make sure each AP is assigned to a different non-overlapping channel and that APs on the same channel are as far away from each other as possible. Turn off all the APs and test bringing each one online separately to see if there is an AP that has a problem.  There could be a hardware issue causing excessive noise.   If you're using ZH everything is using one channel so you could be on a channel that there is interference on.  Try moving to a different one.  From what I hear ZH can work if you don't have many clients but if you're looking at above 20-30 clients I don't recommend it.  I've never tried ZH myself.

Edit: From your other post it looks like this is what you're saying.  You shouldn't need shielded cable for 50 ft unless you're going through something really terrible.    Is the cable touching the transformer used for florescent lighting or anything like that?  Are you sure you've terminated it properly?  You can terminate a cable in a way that will work fine for 100BaseTX but have problems for PoE.    Do you get different results if you move the PoE injector next to the AP instead of the switch (I know this would be a pain for deployment but just curious in terms of testing).

networking,3bu4qd,madkapper,2,Thu Jul 2 04:15:50 2015 UTC,A second meraki access point registered to the same network (in the meraki dashboard) will act as a repeater for everything on it's network (provided it is in range of the wired AP) - just make sure it has power and you're set - bandwidth isn't the same as a wired AP - but it does the trick. When you set it up there's a quality meter/metric that I recall - check the #s there to make sure you're getting decent connectivity between the wired and extended APs.

The later case specially if you use a regular L3-switch as edge with BGP-capabilities who cannot chew a full internet bgp table.  However there are cost effective solutions today if you want to grab one or more full internet bgp tables and that is to use for example Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Pro which goes for about $350 each.  Even if you would use ""only"" default route then your connectivity wouldnt be any worser than you got today.  Something to keep track on is if the interlink between site1 and site2 dies and you go into some kind of split brain scenario (site 1 announces site 2 range even if the packets cannot be forwarded to site 2). So dont forget to setup ip-sla (or similar) to withdraw the announcement of site 2 from site 1 if the link between the sites goes poff (and of course the other way around - stop announcing site 1 range from site 2 if the interlink goes down)."

networking,3bssog,Joker_Da_Man,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:13:40 2015 UTC,It's pretty common to limit guest networks to a very small set of applications:   DNS (TCP and UDP port 53) NTP (UDP port 123) HTTP (TCP port 80) HTTPS (TCP port 443)   If you want you can be more liberal and open up ports for common VPN traffic and other applications like email and chat but most of what people do today is over HTTP or HTTPS.  It's generally a good idea to restrict DNS to your own server or relay.  You can send requests up to OpenDNS for filtering and also do some rewrites like forcing www.google.com and www.youtube.com to resolve to forcesafesearch.google.com (which will enforce safe search and safety mode if you're concerned about minors accessing the network).  A captive portal to get access nice because it provides you the chance to brand the service so they know its for your business as well as control access if you have a lot of neighbors.  That said this is assuming it's more along the lines of business that doesn't cater to people needing to spend their day using your Internet.  If you were running it for a Hotel or something (e.g. Internet access is part of the service they pay for) then I wouldn't filter at all.

But off the top of my head what I think I would do now is... maybe take topologies from vendor C's certification program and try to implement them with vendor J's equipment (virtual or otherwise)?  Or the other way around?  Or a mix of the two?    I say use the certification topologies just because it seems like a good way to get your hand on a reasonably complete set of requirements to design against.  Not really sure where ELSE to get those (outside of ""I know a guy that has a bunch of really excellent notes from past work"" or something), but anything like that should be fine.    And of course if you've got a topology you've labbed up that's a sensible approximation of, say, an ISP, add a few customer sites of various scales, etc... With so many options for virtualization nowadays you could get silly with it.  Customer A just bought Customer B and wants to implement an L2 VPN, but they run brand new Juniper gear and refuse to upgrade/replace any of Customer B's 10 year old Cisco gear.    Oh, but now they've directly absorbed the B's HR into A's HR, and someone decided they HAVE to be added into A's address space... so go ahead and make that happen, but without breaking their access to local resources or security policies.  And then... uh.... meteor strike took out the ISP, so re-implement access between sites load balanced across multiple high-latency satellite links or something.    EDIT:  Or just learn python.

The old model of proxy-based filtering (even with the newer monstrosity that is SSL Inspection) is both invasive and expensive.  The majority of malware research today is focused on tracking down APT domains (the hostnames that advanced persistent threats have baked-in to phone home to).  I'm not surprised Cisco is going after OpenDNS to add to their security portfolio.  That said OpenDNS isn't perfect.  They still don't support IPv6 filtering (even though they host IPv6 reachable servers).  They also don't support rewrites so you can't point www.google.com and www.youtube.com to forcesafesearch.google.com for example.

So if a user tries to upload a 1GB archive of company financial data or employee rosters to their Google Drive, it will be blocked and alerted on.

The problem is that we're seeing companies use the same wireless on-boarding software that's used to install wireless certificates ALSO install a fake root CA for SSL inspection without informing the user and then intercepting all their encrypted traffic in a BYOD situation because they can.  The then hide behind some implied user agreement that said the connection may be monitored or filtered for security reasons as justification to not explicitly inform the user even though it's much more intrusive than what the average user would expect that to mean.  Even worse we're seeing public schools turn to this kind of filtering to deal with the ""SSL everywhere"" movement for CIPA compliance.  Unfortunately the result is that school teachers are now also being spied upon usually without being told.  Maybe someone reveals their sexuality or a serious medical condition in email they assumed was secure.  Depending on the school that might cost them their job.    People are WAY too willing to give up their privacy today.  SSL Inspection should be incredibly offensive to people but it's too complicated for most of them to understand and the US has created such a culture of being watched that the common response is a complacent ""I have nothing to hide""."

If an employee even plugged their personal laptop into the network it just wouldn't function (802.1x computer certificates).  And it's all very clear in the employee policy they sign during hire. Although we don't have a splash screen pop up or anything reminding them each time.  Wouldn't dream of doing it on the employee devices network though. We don't care and if an employee wanted to do something we would normally block they could always just do it over cellular anyway so there's no sense in opening that whole can of worms.  I just always hear people give a blanket argument that you shouldn't do it no matter what but I think there are specific situations where it's warranted.

networking,3bmogj,asdlkf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:15:20 2015 UTC,"That would depend on what aspect of DNS you're talking about.  I've always found OpenDNS, as a DNS resolver, to be slow.  In my experience, Google's DNS has always been much faster (though, lately, I'm using my own DNS (Microsoft), with google as a forwarder).  For DNS Hosting however, I don't think google even does that; so if OpenDNS does (which, honestly, I have no idea. I use Hover), then they would be the superior service by default.  If you need DNS filtering and whatnot, which google doesn't provide, again, OpenDNS would win by default.  As for speed, in my experience, It is not faster or more reliable than Google as an alternative.

What is your current setup for remote sites. How many users will be at your new clinic What services are required  Will this be a long term solution   My preference would be to get a second ASA for the clinic and do a site to site VPN. the ASA can do your routing and/or get a 3850 with IP Services license.  Most designs are moving towards L3 switching if you can afford it."
networking,3br5u4,blahblahdablah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"I edited my original post to reflect some of your well thought out questions.  This is kind of a one off site.  Most of our other sites are all layer 2 MPLS connectivity and this solution is rather unique for our organization.  There will be a max of 50 but probably around 30 people at this location.  Yes this will be a long term solution with whatever we go with, and money for the project isn't an issue.  I don't need to toss a mikrotik router out there or anything.      I have no issues utilizing a 3850 with IP services especially since one of the hops is over a microwave network.    If I go that route however, I would run EIGRP on that 3850 at the clinic and broadcast those subnets out over the microwave network over a layer 2 SVI transit VLAN.  i.e.  I would only have one layer 2 vlan run between the clinic and the VSS layer 3 switch on the left hand side of the diagram.  All of the gateways for this clinic would live on that 3850.    If I do that however, I'm assuming I would be able to run a GRE tunnel back to the 6500 VSS core inside an IPsec tunnel between either ASA's or setup IPSEC on the 3850 itself.  Can you even setup IPSEC on a 3850 and is it a good idea?  I personally haven't done that myself."

Will the clinic use it the cable modem for internet traffic or will all traffic route back to the core and use your main internet ?   In either case I would still recommend a FW at your remote sites.  Another alternative would be to use an ISR instead (like a 2911) which could handle IPSEC with basic FW functionality.

I make decent money, and can see what I need to do to make my next move (basically, get my CCNP R&S as a demonstration that I know what I know, as well as start laying the groundwork for a move to consultancy).  Now, for your situation, I would suggest getting your CCNA, and look for a Tier 1 support position.  It probably won't pay the best, and you may have to be open to relocation (depending on where you live now).  Get some help with your resume, that is key.  Get in touch with a technical staffing outfit, but be aware of who's reputable, and who's only looking to turn a buck off your back and has no qualms about screwing you over.  Both exist.

I've seen BGP work wonderfully in large campus deployments and datacenters, though I haven't seen it deployed in a small office environment before.  It's not really fair to make blanket statements like ""BGP is never appropriate on the LAN"" -- it's more nuanced than that.  Sure, if you do it wrong, it's the wrong choice, but that doesn't mean the technology is inherently bad.  If you're more familiar with IGP's, then sure, BGP is the wrong choice for you to use.  I'm glad you're solving your customers' problems either way, though!  Personally, I figure that there's a number of right ways to do most things, and that at the end of the day the most important thing is that the problems get resolved."

In a heterogeneous environment you simply can't beat it due to the filtering and TE options that work cross vendor.  It is certainly more suited to larger networks though where you can benefit from the segregation offered by AS's.  Two glaring drawbacks are how well do you and your team understand BGP in order to support it? And which vendors are going to make you bend over licensing wise?"

That's part of why I started this - to get different perspectives, not just confirm what I already believe (even if that feels nice sometimes too... just not when when I'm wrong! heh).   I didn't think about the variety of what one might think of as a ""LAN.""   Even LAN v WAN is not a comparison that one can make always (without argument), now that I think of it. I started off being hesitant to use the term 'MAN,' but I find myself wanting to use it more and more.  That reminds me of the things I never thought I'd have to question (or be questioned about).  -An officer asking me if I could 'fix' an issue with a static route. Didn't even know what the issue was yet, just wanted me to start tacking static routes on until it worked. o_0  (I said no, sorry, I ""can't"".)  -Config a static route with a next hop that wasn't... a next hop (not directly connected).

networking,3bowyr,jermudgeon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"True, totally agree. :D  I may be biased in my descriptions, as I've only seen it done Terribly. By people that didn't understand the difference between BGP and an IGP.  Just because you CAN use BGP doesn't mean you SHOULD. If it requires a bit more work to prevent significantly sub-optimal routing, and you know for a fact that the customer is not going to have a permanent network person on to fix it next time a flaw is found (or a workaround is needed, really) after your 3 month contract is up, then an IGP that was designed to work for your purposes by default (or close enough) will be a better choice. It all depends on your goals.  Other times, you might need the power and benefits of BGP, and IGP just won't cut it.  I have seen a lot of 'bad idea fairies,' so my knee-jerk reaction is to keep things as simple as possible, so there's less chance to muck it up. Of course, there's pros and cons - it can be good for scalability purposes, but may also prevent me from seeing a more creative solution that would be a better choice. I'm always trying to improve, though.  It is like using pliers to remove a bolt, when you have the right size socket wrench and bit designed for the job. But, sometimes a pair of pliers works just as good, especially if better tools don't exist. (Okay, I really SHOULD have used an oil filter wrench that time, but it's not like I was gonna re-use the thing...)  I look at it this way - in the typical business LAN there's a choice between static and dynamic routing. Most ppl lean towards dynamic, but I understand that they might be perfectly happy with statics, if they are small and have no need of such things - even though it is nice to be prepared from the beginning so it's less painful when you have to scale up later.   (Like having chicken pox when you're younger - it's just less of a hassle and you bounce back faster.)  Then, you have to choose between IGP and EGP - where it's less black and white. You have to understand both options to make the right decision, but USUALLY people learn IGPs before BGP. For most cases, this is fine, as both will do the job for the LAN generally. Until it doesn't, then it's time to dig in with BGP.   Will their data centers grow enough to see a benefit from BGP? I have no idea, but I doubt it will be any time soon. That would be such a change that I couldn't design for it at this point anyway. -Full mesh BGP neighborships would no longer be appropriate, etc. (HOPEFULLY I haven't made a horrible, horrible mistake. Hahaha.)  I WAS worried 'bout the OTV stuffs, since I am not as familiar with data centers yet, but if I caused any issues - they haven't been discovered yet. And I'm more than happy to rollback if they want to bring me back on site, and leave IGP only on the Office LAN + DC connects of the MAN ring.  I also wonder how great of an idea it was for them to use Nexus devices that had limited routing features as the handoff from DC to Office and from DC to Internet router. I had never seen that before, but as I said, my experience hasn't been as heavy in DCs. I've always thought of them as internal DC switches.  It's when someone learns BGP before understanding IGPs that things really get interesting (which is one of the theories that I like to use to explain the messes I've seen). Of course, you could mess things up by using an IGP where a BGP would be more appropriate, but it doesn't happen as often. Or at least I haven't seen/heard of it personally.  But, LANs are getting more and more diverse, and larger in scale, so there's going to be a lot of exceptions that I haven't even thought of. It's kind of crazy amazing to think of how much has changed, and how perception needs to change with it, or get left in the dust! /dramaticality  TL;DR: BGP is great for large scale. For what it was created for. And that could include the 'LAN' label. :D"

networking,3bowyr,jermudgeon,2,Wed Jul 1 22:17:08 2015 UTC,There is sometimes a place for BGP in the LAN. More often than not BGP in the LAN is more of a dick flex from what I've seen.  The configuration overhead isn't really worth it unless you need it for a very specific reason.  BGP isn't designed to run independently which makes it sort of a pain to configure to do so.

I've been running a co-op village ISP, basically a (very) overgrown LAN, and I'm nearly done turning it into a proper ISP/MSP. Whether or not I'm using BGP for IGP is somewhat a matter of semantics, since from my perspective ""it's all campus."" BGP is just the ticket for my use case: it provides a clear demarcation between customer-facing networks, and keeps traffic and transit networks separate. I'm using OSPF for core IGP.  There are features that BGP offers that OSPF does not; OSPF is a link state protocol, and there are times where you really don't want it flapping.  And since BGP is also the protocol by which I peer with my upstream provider(s), my config management and knowledge base get put to good and similar use.

OK ELI5:  BOOTP is old, people used it in the olden days, like how people used to ride horses.  DHCP is the replacement, think of it as version 2, like how now a days most people travel in cars."
networking,3bo6e9,djdementia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"Lots of vague responses here. Let's fix that for you.  BOOTP allows a booting machine to be supplied IP addressing, a hostname and a TFTP image server. Imagine a lab of workstations.  One of those workstations would have a BOOTP server with a list of MAC addresses and the IP address to be assigned.  Of course what we really want is one BOOTP server for the whole organisation, and so routers gained a ""BOOTP relay"" feature, where they would forward the BOOTP broadcast from a subnet to the central server, altering the packet to record the subnet it was heard on. The central server would use a IP directed broadcast to send its reply back.  BOOTP has no concept of an allocation lifetime, so it really needs a static list of (MAC, IP addresses) in the server. One can imagine a pool of addresses, but without the ability to age out allocation s this doesn't work well in the general case.  To have IPv4 ""just work"" we want to have a pool of IP addresses in a server, which we can allocate for a fixed period. If the ownership of that address isn't renewed then the address can be timed out and used for another client.  The protocol to implement this idea is DHCP.  Now remember that special router support for BOOTP? Rather than wait for routers to support a similar feature for DHCP we designed DHCP to be carried within a BOOTP packet: so any router which can relay BOOTP can already relay DHCP.  Of course DHCP's scheme has substantial issues, most notably in requiring a central server at all. AppleTalk and IPX don't need that -- in those protocols the server broadcasts the subnet information and the client chooses a free address with that subnet. This is what we do for IPv6 SLAAC."
networking,3bo6e9,kombiwombi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"For what ever reason.. Printers seem to want to use BOOTP over DHCP and it's a effing drag.  One of things is how it gives out its identifier, under BOOTP, it uses its normal hardware address. Under DHCp, it adds 2 addition hex to the front of the mac address, creating the client-identifier.   What it comes down to, with BOOTP, you have to power cycle the equipment for any changes too DHCP pools or address changes. Rather effing annoying."

networking,3bnjt0,The_Packeteer,3,Tue Jun 30 19:41:25 2015 UTC,A hub represents one collision domain and communication on any device attached to it should be half duplex.
networking,3bnjt0,the-packet-catcher,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:35:45 2015 UTC,yes
networking,3bnjt0,sg4rb0sss,2,Wed Jul 1 12:08:30 2015 UTC,Very nearly all hubs are half-duplex. But not absolutely all.  There were (very rare) full-duplex Gigabit hubs for sale back when Gigabit Ethernet was very new. Half-duplex Gigabit was developed as part of the standard but hopeless in real life and I never saw a real-world implementation. But Gigabit switch chipsets were very expensive at first. So as a half-way house they developed hubs that had buffered ports to allow them to operate at full-duplex but with reduced contention on the shared backplane.
networking,3bnjt0,splenetic,2,Tue Jun 30 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"The way a hub works logically is this way:  1- listen on all ports  2- when it senses something on a port, it flips switches so that all other ports ""rx"" lines are connected to the ""tx"" line currently speaking  3- switch off and listen again once the transmission is done.  This is why it is an half duplex device. It couldn't connect more than one ""tx"" at once, because it would create collisions.  Physically however, most hubs just takes whatever is on any TX and put it on all RX, collisions are frequent, and throughput is shit. The hub doesn't care if you go full or half duplex, if you only had two devices, it could two full duplex. The PC cares because half means if you receive something while you talk, consider the packet you send as trashed because of the collision. Back off and try again. The hub is not the one managing this, the pc are. At most, a led will light up when two TX talk at once to show a collision occured."
networking,3bnjt0,CBRjack,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:50:03 2015 UTC,Hubs do not listen or do anything in fact. They only forward frames. Your theory is right from a pc's perspective though.

networking,3bnjt0,DavisTasar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:36:45 2015 UTC,"A hub cannot sent or recieve traffic at the same time or there will be a collision. Thats what I thought, but he was saying that collisions weren't relevant in the discusion and the capability of the wires was what mattered, how.many wires could be used to send and recieve.  But it doesnt matter because if the cables are plugged into a hub and send at the same time the signal will collide.  But heres the sticker, if only one device is plugged into the hub with say 100/1000 cable with multiple wires for rx/tx, can it act in full duplex? There is no collision so there is the capability for full duplex right?"
networking,3bnjt0,splenetic,2,Tue Jun 30 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"It's theoretically possible because if all you have are two end-points then you might as well just have a direct cable between them. There wouldn't be any contention for the hub to manage.   In reality, though, the hub will either not be doing auto-negotiation at all - at which point the hosts should default to half-duplex - or will be providing negotiation but only offering half-duplex as a supported option.  The reason for this is historical. Ethernet was originally a shared bus that was intrinsically half-duplex. Stick a couple of hosts on a thin Ethernet segment and they'd still both have to operate at half-duplex because there really could only be one host transmitting at a time. When 10Base-T was developed they took the simplest option which was to just copy exactly the same design principles. That way you could mix and match 10Base-T and 10Base-2/10Base-5 segments and not worry about it."
networking,3bnjt0,CBRjack,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:43:34 2015 UTC,"Even 10mbps wires have different pairs for tx and rx, so I don't see any difference... 1000 has to use all pairs as tx and rx at the same time if I recall correctly."
networking,3bnjt0,Haxim,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"This is true, also interesting to note is that iirc the negotiation for 1000 only happens over two pairs, so it's possible to negotiate to 1000 even though the cable is faulty/unable to support 1000"
networking,3bnjt0,sg4rb0sss,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised nobody actually knew the correct answer for this. Hubs are 100% half duplex. The main reason why is because they share the same collision domain.   On a switch, each port has it's own collision domain. So since one port usually = one pc, then there will never ever be a collision when using a switch unless there is some bug/fault. Hubs on the other hand share one collision domain for all ports.  When a computer transmits data on the wire, it is done so using a signal through the copper. It is the job of other computers to detect this signal and wait for it to be clear before sending. When it's clear they send data. If two machines send data at the same time, they can detect a collision using Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD), which is built into network cards. In short, the machine detecting the collision sends a jam signal (basically an error signal) on the wire so that all other machines stop sending data. They then wait a random amount of time, AKA the ""backoff period"", before transmitting again. You can read up more on CSMA/CD on the Cisco website."

It's also unusual to just have a single host route across the tunnel, but it should work for your setup. Usually people use the /24 over the tunnel instead. If this is is only for pings, then it should work. However, for normal traffic you should use the command     #ip tcp adjust-mss 1456. This is there to accomodate the 20 bytes of tcp header, so fragmentation doesn't have to occur."

And yes I know it's weird it wasn't an actual setup, but just a test for a job so it was just create a tunnel for the host to connect to the server via the two routers.  Yes I know about the TCP adjust command, which for some reason didn't work for me when I tried it on Packet Tracer (which is the brand new student version) but either way it crashes even with just ping traffic so it's not that.   And the single host static route stems from the fact that is I do it at /24 subnet it crashes. If I don't have a static route the tunnel works, no packet tracer crash. If I did it at /24, packet tracer crash when any traffic goes through the tunnel. If I do it at the single host it doesn't crash. That's my entire problem."

It should be fa0/1 because that is your WAN side interface toward the internet.

You could do it without the Firewall ASA, or at least let routing happen on the switch between your internal networks, if it supports some L3 features. You wouldn't have some of the more advanced firewall features but if you're just looking for basic filtering, ACLs on the switch would be enough. It would also be faster (your FW wouldn't have to do anything until something needed to get routed elsewhere, out the WAN, etc.)  If the switch supported programming virtual L3 interfaces to route traffic for those VLANs (the manual from the one you linked appears to). From there, you could just apply ACLs on the switch to achieve the restrictions you mentioned.  If you are going to use the ASA, the switch doesn't need to support much of anything aside from L2 VLANs. However, in this case the ASA would need to be tagged (802.1q), for each VLAN on your switch and serve as a gateway for each.  Static routing just means that the device can't ""peer"" with other routers using OSPF, etc. to share routes. In the network you described, which is pretty small, that is probably fine.  http://www.downloads.netgear.com/docs/m4100/enu/202-11161-01/swa.pdf  Section: 'Set Up VLAN Routing for the VLANs and the Switch' talks about ""VLAN routing"", which is what I mentioned.  Also, for the DHCP question, you can have your DHCP server live in your server VLAN and setup an 'ip helper address' that points to your dhcp server. The docs are a bit unclear on this for netgear, but typically this means that the switch will forward bootp/dhcp requests, which are broadcast, across the L2 boundary to the DHCP server in question. This is a huge plus, otherwise the DHCP server would have to exist in each network at L2.  This explanation is a bit dated, but it's still valid: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_Helper_Address"

How many places could even justify a /24 without wanting to dual home for redundancy?  But if you do have a /24 of PI space but no ASN or no desire to run BGP, and you only have a single Internet connection, then feel free to provide your ISP with an LoA to advertise the space on your behalf and have them do so. I worked for an ISP that did this for a couple customers that had PI space from way back in the day when it was easy to get (send an email to ARIN and they respond with your IP space)."

This is largely because your ISP's ISPs will want it to make sure what they're receiving is a legitimate route.  3) Your ISP will usually need an LOA from you (as the owner) so that your ISP's ISPs will know that what they're receiving is a legitimate route.  3*) Even if you want to BGP with your ISP (with your own ASN or not), they'll still probably need an LOA so that they can tell their upstream to accept it.  It should be mentioned that if you BGP with your ISP via private AS, the rest of the internet sees it identically as though your ISP is announcing your prefix for you.  4) If you are an ISP, with your own allocations and an ASN, you can often just email your upstream ISP's and say, ""hey, we have this prefix, it will be announced from this ASN"", and the whois data matching them up is usually good enough.

Option 3 will normally be fine, I would advise you to originate it from your own AS and announce to your ISP, but under certain circumstances (provided you make sure RIPE / radB records are correct) the ISP may announce it from their own AS for you.

networking,3binop,PehSyCho,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:15:11 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a silly question to me, but: Where?  In general, not from what I can see. If the in-rack switches are ever being pushed, it's probably during VM migrations."
networking,3binop,jandrese,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:50:34 2015 UTC,"Well, ultimately that's the point VA_Network_Nerd is trying to make. Lets imagine you have a 1Gbps interface, and you are trying to push 1.05Gbps across the interface. In theory the higher your packet buffer the more traffic you can push beyond that 1Gbps limit as it will store the data in buffers until it can push it out. Eventually if you are continuously pushing your buffers you WILL run out of buffer space and you WILL drop packets. The theory behind large packet buffers in certain scenarios makes sense. However in a perfect world (the recommended world) you wouldn't let that happen if at all possible. Instead of using 1 1Gbps interface, you would throw two in a bundle. This of course leads to higher cost but it is in my opinion the correct method. If you never come close to saturating your 1Gbps link, then buffers should be in my opinion little concern."
networking,3binop,PehSyCho,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:58:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that all makes sense. Currently all but a couple of our servers have 2 or more ports in a (switch independent) team. So my guess is that the chances of pushing an individual switch port that past 100% for long if at all is next to zero."
networking,3binop,VA_Network_Nerd,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:04:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a little wary of sprucing huge buffers for an iSCSI interface since it may saturate the interface a lot and lead to unbearable latency (Why is my chatty database protocol so slow?!?).    I'm of the school that buffers should be kept as small as reasonable because big buffers only add more latency on top of the loss you get on an oversubscribed network.  It depends how bursty your traffic is mostly, but a lot of times a network that starts out ok when it only goes over the line a bit from time to time grows into a network that is chronically overcapacity in a distressingly short amount of time."
networking,3binop,PehSyCho,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:40:01 2015 UTC,I think this is a little incorrect. You're absolutely right that the 1.5MB buffer size is a limitation if you're reaching interface capacity which is the real question. If you're reaching interface capacity you should plan properly and not buy a switch which doesn't supply the necessary bandwidth / interfaces you truly need.
networking,3binop,VA_Network_Nerd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:14:48 2015 UTC,"You are entitled to your opinion.    Have you managed many iSCSI SAN / LAN solutions ?    Your point is valid.    As I've stated elsewhere, if you have no oversubscription in the network, and no oversubscription in your connected hosts, then a Cat2960 is fine - you have no need for deeper packet buffers.    This is seldom the case with iSCSI SAN solutions.    Entry to mid-range iSCSI NAS/SAN devices usually support 4 or sometimes 8 1 Gbit NICs.    Many of these vendors charge considerably more for additional interfaces.    So lets assume for a moment that the device will have a management interface, and 4 x 1GbE interfaces for storage operations.    If OP only has 4 x 1 GbE servers to use this SAN, then everything will be peachy.    But if the requirement is for 8 or 12 servers, each with 1 x GbE ( a fail-over NIC team), then we have oversubscription.    The only ways to deal with this oversubscription is:      More bandwidth.  Deeper packet buffers."
networking,3binop,mattjames859,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:07:10 2015 UTC,I work with enough environments (Not just iSCSI SAN / LAN solutions) to know what should be be primary goals. A deep packet buffer is a fallback in my opinion only when absolutely necessary due to a heavy spike in traffic. I do not believe that it should be heavily relied upon. In the scenario you provided OP would be in no worse off condition than he is already in. If you're running your interfaces and equipment to that point of utilization you need to look at higher end switches / more ports.   If you have no choice and the only option is grabbing a switch with higher packet buffer then you have no choice. But by no means should that be your first choice in my opinion.
networking,3binop,rawwrX3,2,Tue Jun 30 01:00:08 2015 UTC,"I think we are on the same wavelength then really.

They handle all we throw at it effortlessly. The iSCSI, VMotion, backups, and we also have our DMZ/Inside/Outside on them at one location."
networking,3binop,SubOrbitalOne,15,Mon Jun 29 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"No.    The Cat4948 series do have an unusually large packet buffer by Cisco standards at a ""whopping"" 16 or 17.5MB.  The Arista 7048 has 768MB of packet buffer.    The Dell Force10 has 1.2GB of packet buffer.    If you have a workload / traffic mix that really demands that packets not be dropped there are better options than what Cisco has to offer.    Obviously the best way to prevent drops in the LAN equipment is to ensure there are no points of oversubscription.    At the Top of Rack though, this becomes a challenge when your iSCSI SAN device only has 4 x 1GBe interfaces and is servicing 16 or 20 1GbE client devices.  This is the exact use-case where you want a deep-buffer LAN device.    So when 6 or 10 servers all send a 700Mbps WRITE flow to the SAN, which can't possibly all fit at wire-speed in a 4Gbps port-channel, the LAN can (hopefully, try very hard) to successfuly buffer those write packets until the SAN catches up.    The nice thing about iSCSI is that it is TCP.  So if the packets are lost, they will be resent.    But, can your application tolerate that brief drop in performance while the retransmit occurs?    If the application CAN tolerate packet loss, then who cares?  Use a cheap Cat2960.    If the applicatiion CANNOT tolerate loss, then you have your justification for fancier LAN gear, and SAN devices with more bandwidth.    You simply cannot squeeze more than 4Gbits of traffic through a 4Gbit pipe.  If your SAN architecture is oversubscribed in this sense, then you should expect egress drops on the interfaces facing the SAN device.  Too many packets trying to exit the switch towards the SAN.    Tagging OP, for his benefit & convenience.  /u/ddreier"
networking,3binop,chiefbootkn0cker,3,Mon Jun 29 17:30:34 2015 UTC,"The other nice thing about TCP is that it does flow control. Dropped packets are what make TCP flow control work. If you have deep buffers, and are using TCP, then by the time you find out you are congested, you've got a huge backlog of packets that will end up getting dumped because your receiver can't tolerate megabytes of data out-of-order.  Buffer bloat is a problem, not a solution.  More buffer only really helps if you're using hardware flow control, and don't care about QoS or differential service. For example in a storage network.  For campus networks and mixed data centers with heterogeneous flows and user traffic, more buffer is usually not a good idea."
networking,3binop,rawwrX3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:12:30 2015 UTC,"As I said, it's up to the application.    Can the application tolerate dropped packets and thus a delay in data flow?    If it can, its easier to just drop packets or let flow control try to help.    If the application cannot tolerate delays, then you either need to beef up the device causing the congestion, or buffer packets."
networking,3binop,VA_Network_Nerd,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:15:20 2015 UTC,"I really encourage you to read one of the many excellent papers on buffer bloat.  A little bit of buffering is useful when flows are so short-lived and congestion is so stochastic that flow control does not have time to do its job.  Otherwise, deep buffering thwarts the primary mechanism for LAN and WAN congestion management i.e. the TCP sliding window.  The idea that ""my data is critical and time-sensitive, therefore it needs more buffering"" is more often than not, counter-productive.  If your ToR switch happens to implement WRED or WRED with ECN then sure, set your queue depths a little higher. Otherwise extra buffer is going to burn you. Trust me on this one."

networking,3binop,VA_Network_Nerd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"are the buffer sizes really that important? Cisco seems to do fine with tiny amounts where as Dell throws GBs at the task.

networking,3binop,VA_Network_Nerd,5,Mon Jun 29 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"The importance of the buffer sizes depends on your traffic patterns.    If you have a great SAN to server oversubscription ratio, then you don't need significant buffers.    If your SAN is either oversubscribed, or if one set of devices are 10GbE, and the other set are 1GbE, then you might depend much more heavily on buffer memory to handle micro-bursts of traffic.    I can tell you that packet loss of 1% and higher can be very impactful to application performance.    Packet loss of 0.1% can be detected by many application performance solutions.  Some solutions can detect smaller percentages of loss.    When I do a ""show interface counters errors"" and I see millions and billions of outputDiscards, I know something is very wrong in my environment.  A few thousand, or a couple hundred thousand discards?  Meh.    You need to decide what is important in your environment."

networking,3binop,stazy,2,Mon Jun 29 21:51:08 2015 UTC,"This is a fair question.    The Catalyst 4500 and 4900 devices are a centralized forwarding platform. The packet buffer memory, if I understand correctly is in a centralized pool that is divided out more or less equally to the physical ports. You can tune things to assign a little more here and a little less there within the switch. So, 16MB of buffer divided across 48 ports = .333MB per port as a base. And with the magic of dynamic buffering, more memory can shift from unused ports, or idle ports to highly active ones.    But I think the upper limit per port is 4-6 x default, so back up to the 1.2-1.5MB range.    It gets complicated in that buffers are assigned by the buffer unit and not by the bit or byte...    The 6748 line card in the 6500 has 1.3MB of buffer assigned to each port.    48 x 1.3 = 62.4MB of total buffer memory per line card.    The 6500 cannot borrow unused buffer memory from neighboring ports because it is not a centralized design.    The Catalyst 6500 has been, in my experience (15+ years as a network engineer) the most stable network device I've ever worked on.    Its complicated.  Its frustrating at times.  It has limitations and restrictions.  Its kind of old, and sucks as a medium to high-density 10GbE aggregation device.    But you can just ignore them for years at a time.    Ask your reseller if they can upgrade them to IOS 15.1(2)SY5 or 12.2(33)SXJ9 before they ship them. You might consider redundant supervisor modules as well."
networking,3binop,OutOfThePan,2,Tue Jun 30 00:30:57 2015 UTC,"The 6748 line card in the 6500 has 1.3MB of buffer assigned to each port.   Ok, so what I didn't understand is if it was 1.3MB per card or per port.  With redundant SUPs, we're still talking ~$2k for 144 GigE ports. Even for EoS parts that seems crazy (low)!  Are there any big caveats with going to a 6500, especially for a jack of all trades small business IT guy like myself? And thanks so much for all of your help!  Edit: thinking through this, the only problem with the 6500 is power. None of my UPSes have 240v out, so I'm limited to the 3kw PSUs max.  Edit 2: Found a Cisco power consumption calculator. I might not have enough available power in my ""data center"" for a 6500 at all. :P"
networking,3binop,stazy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:46:01 2015 UTC,"A 6500 with two SUP-720's and 4 x 6748 line cards (fully loaded) will be a fairly power hungry animal.    You will need to use the 6000W power supplies, and feed it 4 x 120V @ 20amp inputs (2 per power supply).    If you can use 220V power, any power supply is fine, though the 2500W power supply would be 88% loaded.    The 4kW PSU's you identified earlier would be fine.    The 4948 is a slightly more simple device.  The configuration requires slightly less effort, because of its centralized forwarding design.    In a 4500/4900 all packets are designed to enter the line-cards (switch ports) and be forwarded up to the CPU, and then exit the switch somewhere.    In a 6500 many line cards are allowed to make forwarding decisions on their own, without bothering the central CPU in the Supervisor module.  This lets the chassis scale to higher and higher total throughput levels.    The 6748 line cards by default use centralized forwarding.  But they are capable of distributed forwarding, if you add a DFC daughter card.    Is this necessary in your deployment?  No, not really.  It wouldn't hurt anything.  But I doubt you'd notice any significant performance improvement.    Ask your reseller to quote WS-F6700-DFC3B or WS-F6700-DFC3BXL if you're curious. Those are the distributed forwarding controllers for the 6748's.    We had about 2500 servers in our data center with 6500's in it.  I think we only put DFC modules in one pair of 6500's as an experiment.    A 6500 is sufficiently complicated that you might want to pay for 2-days worth of consulting time to help configure it.    1 day to learn the requirements from you, and one day to perform the config & provide training.    There are some very good guides out there to help you do it all yourself.    It would work if you just powered it on, and started plugging things in.  But I don't recommend it.  I can't tell you what the right answer is for your environment.    But I've tried to tell you what has worked well in our environment."

Yes, connect the APs directly to the switch. You might need to consider disabling or otherwise not using the WAN port if the APs have one (haven't looked them up). This might depend on the APs ability to also handle vlans and multiple SSIDs. Very likely would need the WLAN management appliance in this case - and a good idea to use it anyways just for RF management. The router would also need to be configured for vlans and inter-vlan routing (probably default, maybe special firewall or NAT rules though).   If internet access is also being provisioned, this is where your AVM home-router may not be able to keep up. If you have anything beefier (say a small computer running pfsense off a USB stick) it may perform better."

networking,3bk2ss,JFICCanada,2,Tue Jun 30 23:12:36 2015 UTC,"Can a standard AVM ""home-class"" Router handle 75 clients? DHCP is what I worry about the most; should I perhaps just use the Router as a Modem and stick a Linux box to it for DHCP?   Pretty much any router will be able to hand out 75 DHCP leases without a problem, but if you were going to do a linux box, you may as well make that your Firewall and just plug directly into the modem, or have your ISP bridge the modem if it's one of those Modem/Router in ones.    Can I just connect the APs to a network switch for WLAN or do I need anything else to get them to work?   Yes you can, however as the people move around your network they will likely need to re-connect to each wireless AP.  One solution would be something like: https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap/  Which allows all Access points to share the Same SSID so that people can walk around seamlessly. I have used them in the past and they work just fine, others may recommend another product.    How hard would it be (if I used a managed switch to put them on different VLANs) to make two separate WLANs for Artists and Crew?   IF you do this then you will need to make sure that you have DHCP servers on both WLANS."

If it's not much make sure the crew and artists know that video streams are not going to work very well. I would DBL check how many DHCP clients are supported if your using a home-class router as DHCP server.  (I got burned with a box that only supported 32) If the number of people in range of the device is over 1000 Hide THE SSID.  It's not often that I would recommend this but you'll be surprised how many people will try to get in while they are board.    CONTROL DNS!!! - If bandwidth is limited a single user hitting YouTube or attempting to watching a clip on ESPN can bring the other users to a stand still.   I used NTOP on a linux box to watch for bandwidth hogs.  Null route the sites that are killing your bandwidth or setup a static web page to explain to the users why the site is not allowed.

I had both the 360 membership as well as ine for odd political reasons. I attended both bootcamps. 360 and any vendor that offers their bootcamps are very constrained. Things like pfr/oer were covered in literally a single lesson. They don't focus on this in the bootcamps at all. The same goes for things like zbpfw, mpls and similar topics. The 5 days is focused on half day labs, and those labs focus on the routing protocols and core areas, which are great, until you can't pass the lab because you don't know a major focus and large point section that you barely studied. Ine on the other hand was ten days and when the Brians were teaching it, you would spend the day learning the technology, breaking it and then applying it to the labs you did. The first week they cover basics with advanced bgp, mpls, and other features being covered in week two, making all the difference. There's no doubt that angry Dave runs his bootcamps the same and the move from cisco 360 to ine has given him much more freedom. I would highly recommend ine to not only polish your skills, but possibly even give you more to think about when it comes to how ready are you really.   Good luck!"

I will say, the INE material is much more in depth and difficult than some of the other labs I have used. From what I hear, if you are comfortable with the INE material front to back, the actual lab should be somewhat easier. Here's to wishing, ha."

INE tend to be more focused and also IMO harder then the actual lab. INE also have some great explanations in the workbooks.  360's video's are annoying and crap, INE's are awesome and very detailed and I am currently going through IPExperts wireless but can't really offer much of an opinion on them at the moment.  I really like INE's stuff. They tend to go above and beyond rather then just doing the bare minimum. I wish they would do CCIE wireless but there is not the demand. 360 had the advantage in troubleshoot part because again it is similar to the live system. I don't know if INE have introduced a newer approach recently though."

networking,3bibnl,1DumbQuestion,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"My experience on the last INE V4/V5 hybrid class was similar to what you are describing.  I got ""angry Dave"" as well.  That was my only meh moment.  He assumes you know a lot going in the door and unless you want to look very silly putting your hand up and asking for an explanation on something you can get lost quickly.  He will do the configs live but you cannot keep up with him (most of the time).  It would behoove you to sit back and watch unless you are very fast and do not make many mistakes in typing because once you do...you are gonna get lost real quick.  The PFR/OER example is actually a salient point for study.  He spent a good bit of time explaining PFR and there is an entire video on INE's  youtube of Brian Dennis explaining it that does not require paid access.    At the time when I took it the class was divided between those gearing up for final V4 attempts and new victims trying V5.  ""Angry Dave"" would teach the first half and prep everyone for both exam relevant content and then dismiss the V5 only folks at the last couple hours to cover V4 only topic (FR, PFR, and L2 QoS come to mind here).  Those topics just weren't on the V5 blueprint and no sense in wasting anyone's time.  If you asked him though he would explain and then some more.  You may not understand it at the time and have to think it through more after the fact.  He was receptive to emails initially but slowed up on response toward the end.  Guess he was getting mauled by people asking questions.    It sounds weird to call him ""Angry Dave"" but it's just a personality difference.

Unlike ANY other training i've ever been in, Narbik could answer EVERY question I had..be it ""What if you do X"" or ""I saw this one thing one time..."" etc, etc.    Finally...I did Narbik's bootcamp simply because it was different.  I'd done all of INE's labs available at the time and simply wanted access to more labs.  In addition, new labs = new ways of presenting faults and other configuration issues.

Things typically start around 9-10.  I think the amount of content he has for a normal class (9-5, 5 days a week) would be 2-3 weeks.   Narbik knows that it's hard enough to get time off of work for this kind of training, so he wants to give you all the content and the only way is to go long days with out taking the weekends off.  At the end of every day I was burnt out, but I went back to the hotel, slept for 7-8 hours and was ready to go again.  It's one of those classes that you're never really tempted by distractions because there's so much to cover and so much to do.  12 hours will go by without you noticing and you'll want to get to class in the morning because you're actually learning things.  Narbik hates slide presentations so he does everything on the whiteboard, which I loved because the room isn't darkened at all and you're engaged in the lecture.  Narbik feeds his classes great food (at least in Glendale) so you'll never go hungry.

I was seeing the exact same error messages and TAC confirmed the version of OpenSSL ISE was using does not support RSASSA-PSS.  Changes were made on the PKI server to use RSA256 instead and ISE authentication started working properly.  We did continue to experience a slight annoyance though.  Once the correction was made the previous certs weren't revoked properly.  So devices would receive the new intermediate certificate with RSA256, but it was also receiving earlier chains with RSASSA-PSS, which would cause periodic failures with ISE.  Correcting this fully resolved the issue.  This was with ISE 1.3 earlier in 2015, so perhaps Cisco started using a newer version of OpenSSL with ISE 1.4, but it looks like whatever version it is it still won't support RSASSA-PSS."

But at the same time (until a valid reference/source is located) I can still see why overrun isnt counted as an input error because the frame itself isnt necessary bad - there just were no room in the input buffer to receive and process this particular frame."
networking,3blsc1,Apachez,0,Tue Jun 30 07:08:07 2015 UTC,Because the Cisco programmer's view was from the point of view of the Ethernet controller. Look at it that way and the classification of the counters males sense.
networking,3blsc1,kombiwombi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:15:43 2015 UTC,Sure but any valid source would be nice.  One thing to consider is a firmware update (or downgrade) to check if the input error counter remains at 0 even if overruns goes up.
networking,3blsc1,Apachez,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:41:48 2015 UTC,"I've got to disagree. If input errors increases then you know it is a link-layer issue. If it had counted any packets which failed to reach the forwarding plane will that could include faults in the backplane the bus and crossbar switch and other router components, complicating debugging.  The large number of overruns is because the router is failing to service the ring-buffer of the ethernet controller before the controller overwrites a yet-to-be-removed entry in the ring buffer. There are some tuning parameters for the ring-buffer, but generally speaking the router is too small for the load presented."
networking,3blsc1,kombiwombi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:48:02 2015 UTC,"Yes but thats more of an ""input fail"" rather than ""input error"".  Error to me is something which is broken with the frame itself.

The error is complaining that you don't have a bgp neighbor named received-routes   why not?   Policy applied to incoming routes can change/delete things. There's no reason for the router to remember hundreds of thousands of routes as received, so BGP only remembers the routes as they look after having applied incoming policy.  'soft-reconfiguration inbound' allows you to re-apply incoming policy without coordinating with the neighbor. In order to do that, you need to hold the as-received BGP routes. A side effect of holding the as-received prefixes is that you can display them with the command we're talking about here. If you don't hold onto the un-mangled table, you can't print it."

In the last year, I finally added a summary that summarizes and quantifies specific categories of experience -- short bullets with specific numbers attached.  Outside of this, no other info goes on my LI profile -- that's what my actual resume is for.  Partly because it changes extremely quickly sometimes and partly because it's a ton of information to curate as my career evolves, and I prefer to use the resume as a single source to avoid having to make the same changes in multiple places / worry that something is outdated / etc.  Feel free to PM me for my profile link if you want to see what I'm talking about."

networking,3bjq5b,mrojek,4,Tue Jun 30 07:58:04 2015 UTC,"Re-posting for yet another monitoring thread  I've spent the past two months on this same project as we are currently using Solarwinds, and looking to get a new monitoring solution that actually gives us the info we need. Let me try to save you a little time. I've done testing on a TON of monitoring solutions, set up test instances, and weighed the benefits/drawbacks of each. Disclaimer These are the results of me setting each of these up, trying to get at least a few nodes added and monitored, and then shown off to others. I'm a networking guy and NOT a sysadmin or a Linux guru, so for those that live in Linux and write config files for fun when they go home at night, be aware.  Observium  Pros   Pretty Interface Fast config Nice graphing features   Cons   Requires all hosts to be added by DNS, will not add by IP Younger development cycle Less user plugins than other similar solutions   Zabbix  Pros   Relatively easy deployment   Cons   All the manual implementation of Nagios Core, without the same level of user support   PRTG  Pros   Windows based solution makes set up and management easy Beautiful interface  for monitoring   Cons   Struggled to keep the server running solidly for more than even a few hours.   ICINGA2  Pros   Beautiful interface as well   Cons    Not personally wanting to manage Linux config files to add my hosts and services one of my primary motivators was being able to implement a web config tool. Unfortunately either through my own inexperience with Linux, or just because there isn't much, I was unable to get a web config working and abandoned the effort after a couple days of working on it.   Check_Mk  Pros   Easily one of the best interfaces for nagios core out there in terms of functionality Being just a front end for nagios allows support for all the existing nagios plugins automatically the check_mk client for server monitoring is easy to get up and running and works wonderfully without any need to mess with much They have a rack mounted appliance for sale relatively inexpensively that makes deployment cake (This however is a bit deceptive, as seen below)   Cons   Their yearly subscription cost is done by service, leading to an enormous hidden cost. I went from expecting to pay 3 to 4 grand for the total product to getting a quote for 12k with a 9k yearly expense.    OMD  Pros   INSANELY easy to deploy, and allows you to kind of roll your own nagios build with all the bells and whistles, without having to spend three weeks reading all the documentation for every plugin just to get started.  the check_mk interface makes the set up a snap, and being able to use different interfaces is a definite boon   Cons   There is no commercial support level for OMD that I was able to locate, so unless you are comfortable with forum support and trying to figure things out on your own, you might want to look at more commercial solutions At least the debian package I was using seemed to be using an older version of nagios than the current nagios core, that made getting help in nagios forums a little difficult   Nagios Core  Pros   Tons of support in forums Free   Cons   Adding a host to nagios requires writing out the config in scripts for the host, and any services you want to use. Despite buying a book and reading through it, and watching tons of videos, nothing made this process any faster or easier.  OH DEAR GOD IT'S ALL SCRIPTS AAAARRGGGHHHHH   Nagios XI  Pros   All the flexibility and capability of nagios, with some truly excellent configuration tools Has a pretty affordable ( if you are leaving solarwinds) annual cost Has some nice additional features like capacity planning in the enterprise version that make executive types happy Offer a five day instructor lead training class for a reasonable price to help you get started.   Cons   If you don't have a decent budget to build your solution, then it's probably best to try to work with OMD It's still Nagios, anything that you want to do that someone else hasn't gotten on the exchange means you are still going to have to figure out the scripting. nrpe and requires a significantly more involved install process to get everything you want monitored going as compared to check_mk  In the end it came down to check_mk's appliance solution or the nagios XI solution. The surprise cost of support with check_mk ended up swinging the choice to XI. I can't say if it's the right choice or not as I just got the product set up, and I'm waiting to really start implementing it after I do the training class I signed up for with them, but I will let you know.   P.S. If you are using Solarwinds NCM solution to back up configs like we are, I was able to find an absolutely AMAZING solution called Net Line Dancer. It can be VERY costly for a lot of nodes, but the things it can do absolutely blew my mind. We managed to scale things back to the more minimum requirements and fit it in our budget, but if config management is something you need to do, take the time to download the demo and give it a spin. I was immensely happy with it. We deployed it to production only a few weeks ago and in that time I've been able to eliminate over 150 ""forgotten"" local accounts on our devices from old net admins, push an IOS update to over 400 devices without an incident, and I can daily see any device that have unsaved changes to the running config."

There aren't many realistic use-cases where you'd do this but it can be useful sometimes. In Cisco devices you can assign both a primary and multiple secondary ip addressed to layer 3 VLAN interfaces. This capability would allow you to transition a VLANs addressing to a new subnet if necessary. I have had to do this in the past because we were using private IP space on our management VLAN and we had security requirements that we use public space. I know that probably sounds odd, but it was a DoD thing.   You could also accomplish this by running two VLANs simultaneously with different address space and decommissioning the old one when the new one is transitioned to completely. This is probably a better solution in most scenarios. Ours happened to be a unique scenario with a strict deadline.  Take note that it is never a great idea from a security perspective to run two separate subnets within the same VLAN, but if it is only temporary sometimes it may be for the greater good."

If you put those 10 PC's on the same LAN (just using dumb switches), would the broadcast traffic hit all 10 PC's? Yes.  If you put 5 of those PC's on one physical LAN, and the other 5 on a different physical LAN, they would be isolated. This is the same basic idea as putting 5 on VLAN 1 and 5 on VLAN 2.  VLANs are there for when you actually want to make 2 (or more) different networks, but can't justify buying 2 of every switch and running 2 of every cable. Like everything, it gets a lot more complicated in implementation, but this makes a good starting point for thinking about the when and where of VLAN design."

networking,3bizbh,Psdyekick,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way: A ""LAN"" is a bunch of network interfaces that will broadcast to each other. Usually a LAN is physical switches and hubs, modern switches have ""VLAN"" options. If two switches are connected to each other, then you've doubled the number of interfaces on that LAN. All that you've done with your single ""VLAN"" is make it so those 10 physical interfaces will broadcast to each other, as though you had connected 4x 4 port network switches together (bad example, but it works)  C=Computer U=Uplink I = Interface Iface:   I0 I1 I2 I3 Switch0: C0 C1 C2 U0 Switch1: C3 C4 C5 U1 Switch2: C6 C7 C8 U2 Switch3: U0 U1 U2 C9   On top of a LAN you build Subnets. These subnet IP Network ranges are completely irrelevant to a LAN or VLAN. In my example, C0-C4 using subnet1 , while C5-C9 use subnet2.  EXAMPLE0: Let's say C7 powers on and sends out a DHCP request to the broadcast IP 255.255.255.255 and MAC ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Switch2 receives that packet with broadcast destination MAC, so it sends it out to C6, C8, and U2. This results in Switch3 receiving that broadcast packet and sends it out to U0, U1, and C9. Switch0 and Switch1 send the broadcast to C0, C1, C2, and C3, C4, C5, respectively.  EXAMPLE1: Now lets say C4 pings 4.2.2.2, which isn't in either subnet. C4 sets the Destination MAC address to the last known MAC Address of its default gateway, which we'll pretend is C0. Switch1 receives packet with dest MAC 00:00:00:00:C0 (C0 for short), which it last saw on I3, which is U1 to Switch3 I1. Switch 3 last saw dest MAC C0 on I0, which is U0 to Switch0. Switch0 saw C0 on I0 and sends the packet to it."

However, the broadcast IP will either be 192.168.1.255 or 192.168.2.255. When the host examines the dst IP at layer 3, if it is from the different subnet it will see the broadcast IP is not what it knows and drop the traffic.   They will all receive the broadcast frames, and after examining the layer 3 header they will accept the broadcast or drop the packet based on whether or not they are in the same subnet."

This is because it is one of the few pieces of software not made by VMware that is allowed to run inside the kernel.  Things running in kernel that have problems can easily impact the kernel (I think something like 90% of purple screens are caused by either drivers or 3rd party kernel processes).     In practical terms, this means strict adherence to the compatibility matrix for versions of everything (down to exact build numbers).  Also, I would highly recommend having a couple hosts in a lab cluster configured the same as your prod clusters so you can test ANY sort of update or config change before it goes to prod.    I think the 1000Vs bad rap in this area is a bit undeserved - a customer's incautious operational practices aren't Cisco's fault.

It's a long story and took months to track down, but it wasn't any fault of the N1Kv. Basically, we had introduced a new host based AV that utilized vShield. Well a very specific bug having to do with vShield caused a memory leak in the API that VMware provides for use with its networking stack specific to the version of VMware that we were running. When the memory pool allocated to that networking API ran out of memory, it would no longer forward traffic to any NEWLY spun up VM on that specific host, whether it was freshly booting or vMotion-ed. That caused the Cisco side of the software to seem like the software port was disconnected. Took Cisco, VMware, and VCE the better part of 6 months to finally track it to a bug in the version of vSphere 5.1 we were using. Cisco actually did the best troubleshooting out of all of them. Their software team seemed to know the inner workings of VMware's product better than VMware did. Upgrading the to a newer build of VMware where the bug was fixed obviously fixed the issue.

networking,3bf0h5,Eli_570,41,Sun Jun 28 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"Circuit switching is best thought of with a 'phone call' analogy: there's a circuit establishment, then you get a bitstream of a particular bitrate until you clear down the call. It was, of course, invented for voice. It's widely used for satellite too: if you're broadcasting the World Cup final then no one wants that to run into capacity issues. Circuit-switching has some nice attributes: once you've established the call then you are not subject to denial of service, there's no packetisation needed: just whack that digital TV feed directly into the channel. But there's a lot of internally wasted bandwidth: for example phone calls are at least 50% silence (people generally don't talk over one another), but using circuit switching we can't recover that bandwidth.  Packet switching allows efficient use of bandwidth, at the cost of packetisation and adding jitter. The miracle technology is TCP, which allows the a reliable connection over best-effort packet forwarding, and there was a lot of opposition to packet protocols until people accepted that TCP worked.  It doesn't really make sense to place a VoIP call over a circuit-switched connection on the basis of one VoIP flow per circuit. It's no cheaper and a lot more complex.  It does make sense to do this on the basis of N VoIP flows per circuit, where N is as large a number as the nastiest codecs a call card provider can use to extract the most revenue from their satellite channel."

networking,3bf0h5,Apachez,5,Mon Jun 29 03:03:30 2015 UTC,"Also even with packet switched networks and VoIP you will often encounter the situation of using QoS.  With VoIP, which is realtime traffic, there is no need for the packet to arrive outside the codec window size (normally approx 20-30ms or so depending on codec) which gives that if a VoIP packet is delayed more than approx 30ms it can just be thrown away and make room for the next packet instead (because the receiving end will throw it away anyway since the sinuswave has already been decoded and missing packets have been extrapolated).  This gives that VoIP is often preallocated bandwidth on top of your regular traffic flows. So that there will always be bandwidth available for the VoIP traffic to use. Depending on QoS engine you use this preallocation is either statically allocated (and cannot be used for other packets) or dynamically (other packets can use it but as soon as a VoIP packet shows up the lower prio packet will just be thrown to /dev/null to make room)."
networking,3bf0h5,bvierra,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:08:30 2015 UTC,"Just a note to this for people reading it later... 99.9% of the time QoS packets are only good on your LAN.

In the voice world there is SS7, which is the signaling behind voice calls. It sets up and tears down circuit paths on-demand.

They are VCs that are configured in a way so they have many of the characteristics of an actual circuit-switched network, however, they are still packet-switched networks.

VoIP by nature, itself, uses packet switching, because it's over IP, which is a packet-switched protocol. you can convert it to line-switched, but it just converts it at the module.  The back end is still VoIP and you're left with a crummy analog phone at the endpoint (but maybe that's the point)."

networking,3bhhd2,Hf444,5,Mon Jun 29 06:51:48 2015 UTC,"I earned a computer science degree as well, and before I started to focus on network engineering I did a lot of UX design and software engineering.  Now I'm a network architect/consultant/engineer (among several other hats).  What sucked me into networking was the magic of the infrastructure and the ability to think creatively and abstractly while also still feeling like I was accomplishing something tangible.  At the end of the day, a piece of software or a graphic design is just a set of bits projected onto a screen -- when you walk away from the computer, it's hard to feel like you're doing something tangible.  When you design and implement a computer network, you get the creative and artistic elements, but you also get the feeling of raw, cold hardware in your hands, wires bundled up neatly, etc.  You can see and feel how everything is connected, from end user desktops to racks of servers in datacenters to ISP interconnection points.  When a line you laid lights up and makes a connection, you have all of the physical pieces to see in action.  Networking connects people in many ways, from phone calls to video conferences to manufacturing processes and financial systems -- the world we know today wouldn't exist without communication networks.  Maybe this is waxing a tad poetic, but it works for me.  My passion, regardless of specific field, is developing and exercising creative skills while also making a positive difference on the world.  Networking is one of several ways I'm able to do that, and I'm pleased to have my career centered around it (albeit not exclusively).  I had a few early experiences, but what ultimately shoved me in this direction was doing a few co-op rotations as a network engineer with a large equipment vendor while I was in college.  I absolutely, strongly recommend you do co-op -- take a semester or two off to work fulltime in a role that's far more challenging and rewarding than a 3-month summer internship.  For getting started, check out some books, articles, videos, etc related to the CCNA certification from Cisco -- it's a nice basic generalist certification that gives a guide for learning the basics.  You don't have to actually pay to take the exam, just use that as a baseline to start looking for materials.  If you like wireless, check out the CWNA certification materials.  Grab a copy of GNS3 and/or pick up a few cheap old switches and routers from eBay (should be able to get a few of a moderate vintage for $100-$200), play around with the CLIs and practice wiring up a few basic topologies to test out the concepts you read about.  Networking is in demand everywhere and the west coast is no exception.  Bear in mind that the most siginificant factor in job duties, compensation, etc come from the role you play inside a company, not the company/location/etc.  If you are in a position that directly results in revenue for the company (i.e. as a consultant, sales engineer, etc) you will have a very different experience from someone who is working as a network engineer on enterprise infrastructure for a paper production company (for example).  Core enterprise infrastructure is seen as a ""cost center"", whereas customer-facing roles are seen as directly revenue-generating.  That translates directly into regular compensation differences as well as opportunities for bonuses, career advancement, etc.  Learn as much as you can as fast as you can.  Take jobs that help you get experience as quickly as possible -- work for a variety of companies in a variety of roles.  Don't be a one-trick pony...find a way to create a complex, interesting, and valuable perspective for yourself that is both personally useful and higher value to employers than someone who is just another cog in the machine.  Good luck!"
networking,3bhhd2,drakontas,2,Mon Jun 29 08:12:35 2015 UTC,"A great starting point would be CBT Nugget videos. Use those to get the knowledge needed to study up and get certified, while you are getting your degree. For your CCNA, also look into getting Packet Tracer for Router/Switch simulation. Go on eBay and purchase a router (1841 or 2811) and a switch (3550 or 3560) and play with them.   There are a good amount of opportunities within the networking field, but having your certifications will help get your foot in the door.  Best of luck in all your endeavors"

Agreement to terms of use is vital, yes. We're in Germany and the legal situation here makes the operator of a hotspot liable for any nonsense done by its users when there's no such thing in place. MAC-Tracking was tried out (Radius+Hotspot on the Mikrotik, simple Client-Mode on the TP-Link's) but I failed to find a way to forward the adresses to the Mikrotik for good, it always seemed to forward the MACs of the TP-Links and so made only one session in total possible, haha ;)    @mrhhug: It's shaped to 30mbit/s and there's supposed to be data-limits for the accounts. The Authenticable accounts are supposed to be delivered there in simple list form. The MikroTik antenna connects to another network, yes. But that's because we're in a rural area and the firm I work for is using wireless tech to hook small communities up around here. Basically we could, for all intents and purposes, ignore the Mikrotik in this setup. As I said, I've tried using its Radius/Hotspot functions for ease of use, but fell on my face again and again.    @Syran2k1: Problem here is that it's a good will project. Barely any budget in the first place - see the consumer routers - and no money to be generated. I'll buy a Raspi from my own money since I care, but three Unifi-Pro are just that much more. That being said, it'd probably be what I'd have used if I had the resources ;)    @SimonHova & 102381: Well, Wifidog was offered to me by OpenWRT and going through its docu, the need for a Linux system became evident. There's no budget for anything big, but the Model 2 B should have enough bang to handle a small SQL/Web server for the Auth and Free-Radius, shouldn't it? It's small, light and uses very little power. Strikes me as a good solution, but I wouldn't write this if I was sure. Your feedback makes me a bit more confident in the idea, however.

If you tag users as /u/siredcalot rather than @siredcalot, the tag will turn into a link.  If that user has Gold, they'll also get a notification they've been tagged in a post.  Now as for terms of use, that's just a captive portal which can easily be done with DD-WRT or MikroTIK or almost anything else, without any RADIUS backend.    It sounds though like you want to be able to create and delete accounts for people, and then track how much data each one uses.  Is that correct?  If you're getting Ubiquiti, skip the UAP-Pro.  For something cheap like this use UAP or UAP-LR- they're 2.4GHz only (so be careful if your area is RF-congested) but at around $60USD they're cheap...

With Ubiquiti you will also trunk the relevant VLANs to each AP so that they can forward appropriately.  When we set up/redesign networks for customers, we will typically follow something like this: VLAN 5 - wired/data VLAN for end-user devices, printers, etc. (we avoid using default VLAN 1 wherever we can) VLAN 10 - Voice VLAN (set up for voice VLANs is a bit different between manufacturers) VLAN 15 - Staff wifi VLAN 20 - Student wifi (if a school, of course) VLAN 25 - Guest wifi VLAN 100 - Servers VLAN 999 - Management  Lots of ""room"" between VLANs for future additions (dept.-specific, iSCSI, w/e) while still keeping pretty simple. Of course, make sure to keep plenty of space between your actual subnets as well (multiple congruent /24s make sad panda sad). I could probably send you an example deployment topology/base config if you're interested."

networking,3bepl7,youfrickinguy,2,Sun Jun 28 15:48:26 2015 UTC,Just a quick addition.  Your trunk ports should have a native VLAN configuration set to an unused VLAN.  This unused VLAN should not have an SVI on your core.  Setting a native VLAN to an unused VLAN will help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks where a user plugs in an unmanaged switch on a trunk with an unmanaged PC and injects unwanted untagged traffic.  I am only using Cisco terms here as that is all I know.
networking,3bepl7,Copter64,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:59:10 2015 UTC,"You will also want to use 'switchport native vlan XX' or the equivalent since the unifi expects its management traffic untagged, as far as I know."
networking,3bepl7,belgarth,3,Mon Jun 29 16:42:13 2015 UTC,"With unifi, I recommend tagging all ports with your wlan and guest wlan.  Example, vlan 10 is wlan, vlan 20 is guest wlan, you can tag all ports for vlan 10 and 20.  Make sure now on the unifi Mngr to have those ssids tagged accordingly.  As for wired nodes, it depends on their abilities.  If all servers can tag, then do it, it will allow you to tag all ports and avoid going to a per port config.  Otherwise you have to setup your untagged and pvids to what is needed.  Sorry for the short speak, typing from a phone."
networking,3bepl7,Skilldibop,3,Sun Jun 28 17:26:16 2015 UTC,"To help address your concern over the time it will take to do the configuration: most switch os's will have some way to do bulk configuration changes, so you can apply the same configuration change to ask like ports, like the user clean ports. For example, in Cisco IOS, it would be ""interface range ...""."
networking,3bepl7,auriem,2,Sun Jun 28 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"Usually management isn't an issue as your servers will typically all be on a separate switch to your clients. So those switches are pretty much all server VLAN access ports, then LAN switches are pretty much all Client VLAN access ports. The only places you'll need to manually configure stuff is the uplinks between switches to ensure they have all VLANs tagged on them (or if cisco, just set ""allowed VLAN All"" on them) and the Ports your wifi APs connect to."

networking,3bfmgw,SirEDCaLot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:00:43 2015 UTC,"Put this in CIDR notation and it's easier to think about:   Your company has the following assignment:  170.16.0.0/24 a. Write the address for two valid subnets on this network. b. Write the address of two hosts on each of these this network (total of 4 hosts).   Now you can split a /24 into smaller subnets easily, say /29.  Remember you don't have to split cleanly on the octet mark- the decimal numbers just represent 32 binary bits so you can use as many or as few of those bits as you want.  You can use this tool to calculate what the decimal numbers will look like.  Like so:  a. 170.16.0.8/29 (covers 170.16.0.8 - 170.16.0.15), and 170.16.0.24/29 (covers 170.16.0.24 - 170.16.0. 31)   b. 170.16.0.9 & 170.16.0.10 for the first subnet, 170.16.0.26 and 170.16.0.27 for the second subnet.  Now it's worth mentioning that in every address range, the first address is the Subnet ID, and the last address is the broadcast address.    So for a clean /24 like the example. 170.16.0.0 is the subnet ID, and 170.16.0.255 is the broadcast address.  Neither one can be assigned to a host.    And in my example b, 170.16.0.9 is the Subnet ID, 170.16.0.15 is the broadcast address for the first one.  170.16.0.24 is the Subnet ID and 170.16.0.31 is the broadcast address for the second one.

networking,3beilc,drakontas,7,Sun Jun 28 14:34:20 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  Wireless design consultant here, I work with clients around the US and do both events and long-term installs like what you're talking about.  Engenius makes consumer grade equipment, which is not what you need here.  I've worked with it before -- sure, it's cheap. But you get what you pay for.  Flaky devices, each AP has a hard time handling more than 15-20 connected devices, etc.  There is also no central control system (they're ""autonomous""), meaning you have to login and manage each device individually.  Also, zero competent support from the company -- they're beat effort, not something a business can rely on.  At the very least you should be looking at Ubiquiti's UniFi AP Pro models -- bought in 3-packs you can get them for around $200 apiece.  They have more powerful radios, feature right software for configuration, a central control system that allows unified config and diagnostics for the whole system, etc.  However, UniFi is still consumer grade on the WiFi side (ignore their marketing efforts) -- they lack normal enterprise features like band steering and they provide zero direct support (only email and forums).  I'd strongly recommend using a proper enterprise grade vendor.  My personal favorite is Aerohive, but any of the enterprise vendors will be fine -- Aruba, Cisco, Meraki, Ruckus Xirrus, etc.  Find a reseller who can get you the best discount and get an installer who knows how to design and deploy these devices, and you're all set.  If you have a high volume reseller you should be able to get equipment that fits your needs for around $500 per AP, potentially less depending on model chosen and discounts available.  Near the end of each quarter (for example June 30), you can get the best deals because the sales teams are trying to make their quotas.  The July-September quarter has the least deals because that's when all of the schools are buying in bulk using their government subsidies (the sales teams don't have to work as hard).  For professional discussion, the /r/wireless folks are better suited than /r/networking.  For learning how to do this yourself, grab a CCNA Wireless book and/or the CWNA book.  However, note that all of the textbook reading in the world still won't prepare you fully to properly select and configure the right hardware for your environment -- that comes with experience.  As a caution, there's a lot to learn in terms of properly laying out signals, understanding user behavior, troubleshooting, etc -- there's a reason why people have careers based around this type of work :-)  Feel free to reply or message me directly to chat more.  Good luck!"

If I am looking at the units being mounted outside, (We are a motel, entrances to the rooms are located on the outside of the building, not all inside unfortunately) I would be looking at the UAP outdoor units I believe. Would it be better to have more of those units, try to have 3/4, and none of the UAP Pro units, or try to have a combination of them to have more AP's to cover more of the property?"

Fewer units could do the trick but you're also dividing up less total available bandwidth, airtime, etc among your users.  Read up on the physics involved and the comparisons between APs and switches to better understand the tradeoffs.  Zero handoff from Ubiquiti is always a bad idea -- there is never a case when it is a good design choice, though there are cases where it can be less bad than other cases.  ZH works by putting all of the APs on the same channel -- read up on cochannel interference to understand why this will result in a terrible experience for users."
networking,3beilc,JasonDJ,2,Mon Jun 29 03:19:36 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised nobody here has mentioned fortigate/fortiap.   A fortigate 90 or 100...maybe even a 60... should be sized properly for 100 simultaneous clients.  A little more involved of a setup than ubiquity, but gives you more control, since the Fortigate itself is a router, firewall, and wireless controller all in one. And it gives you the ability to completely segregate guest and employee/business traffic (look into VDOMs).  And it makes it easy to block botnets, peer2peer, and other bandwidth hogs very easily.  Oh, and it can let your lobby employees easily generate unique guest passwords for every user."
networking,3beilc,julietscause,4,Mon Jun 29 01:57:13 2015 UTC,"A single fortigate (heck, a single AP of any brand) is not anywhere near enough to cover the 7000sqft area the OP described, even if it was a completely flat wide open field and not a motel with walls and windows."

So he can have a Fortigate with integrated AP at the main office/checkin and a couple more throughout the building, all reporting back to the same central management.   Even 3 seems kind of light given that he probably (hopefully) has some reasonably thick walls between rooms.  If you want to do it right, there should be significant overlap over the coverage areas.  OP, quality WiFi is something that guests remember.  If you want repeat business (making VOIP calls/meetings from the room) and/or cater to a lot of business and family guests (kids want to watch Netflix and play games on their DS), I recommend you don't cheap out on placement.

networking,3beilc,CBRjack,5,Sun Jun 28 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"First things first: Set up a segmented network with a firewall between your VLANs.  Here is a very simple network I diagrammed for you. The firewall will prevent communication between each network.  Your current router (Netgear R6100) does not have support for VLANs, so on a tight budget, I'd recommend a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite, they are < $100 and are extremely powerful (mine at home can handle a 300Mbps WAN connection with no issues).  Next, you'll need a switch that can be configured with VLANs. I don't know what your network size is, but you can get something like a Cisco SG300-10 for a little under $200. That's only 10 ports, so you could have your uplink (switch to router), plus 9 devices (three APs + 6 ""other""). If that's not enough, they also make a 20-port model, or you could look at another vendor (Mikrotik makes high quality but affordable stuff, but it takes some strong networking knowledge to configure).  You can use your existing APs, or return them and get something else. I'd recommend 3x Unifi AP-Pro APs, for just under $200 each. You will need to use a PoE injector (included with the units) unless you get a Ubiquiti Switch (they have proprietary PoE implementation on their hardware). If you go the Ubiquiti route, you will also need to install the controller software either locally on a computer in your motel (I recommend something that is stationary and stays powered on 24x7), or a cloud server (a $5/mo DigitalOcean VPS does fine).  With all of your hardware ready, you're ready to start configuring your network.  Step 1: You'll program your firewall/router to use one port for WAN, one for LAN, and set up your VLANs. This is very simple to do with Ubiquiti stuff, I can show you some example configs if you're interested. Cisco is also pretty easy, but I've also been working with Cisco for some time.  Step 2: You'll set up your switch to have the proper VLANs and trunking/access on a per-port basis. Pick one to be the uplink back to your router, pick a few for APs, and program it all. Again, Ubiquiti is easy, but so is the Cisco SG300 (any of the Cisco Small Business equipment is pretty simple to use, even for a newbie). Make sure to set the switch to have an IP in the Admin VLAN instead of the default VLAN.  Step 3: You'll install the AP controller software. This is a very simple process. Log in to the controller and set up your networking settings (Wireless names, VLAN per SSID, guest policies, etc).  Step 4: Bring your APs online and adopt them to the controller. If you're using a Cisco or Ubiquiti router, you can set a DHCP option to point the APs to connect to the controller you set up in step 3 automatically. You'll still need to ""accept"" the adoption in the controller, but once you do, the controller will provision each AP. You can also go ahead and upgrade the firmware to the latest version.  Step 5: Physically install your hardware. This is where the folks at /r/wireless will probably be more help in planning the optimal layout for the placement of your APs. Essentially, run your cable and plug it all in.  As long as everything is configured properly, you should now have a working mesh wireless network throughout your motel. The total cost should be a little under $1,000 for hardware (if you go with my suggestions), plus your labor (this could probably all be done in a few hours, to be honest, especially if you know anyone who's knowledgeable about this sort of thing).  Let me know if you have any questions!"

networking,3beilc,Sbatio,4,Sun Jun 28 16:13:09 2015 UTC,"A consumer router will shit itself with that many devices because it needs to store each connection in memory for NAT. If you can't afford a business class router, you can run pfSense on a computer to transform it into a proper router.  Wire all your APs, if not, throughput will be pretty much zero for remote APs. The cheapest solution for extending cabling to the last access point is to install a switch at or before the 300' limit of cat5e. Router <- 300' -> Switch -> First AP, and also <- 300' -> Second AP.  Yes, Ubiquiti makes really good stuff, all controllable from a pc, but you can use what you have to do the job.  Look into pfSense, or any business grade router, like the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter. Look at the cabling distance in between APs if they have a built-in switch, or install small switches near the APs.  APs would need to be distributed relatively equaly. To cover 700' : 175', AP, 175', AP, 175', AP, 175'.  You should call a professional, but if you are not rushed, shoot me your questions and I'll try to help."

Try having a lawyer negotiate a job offer for you- If you are in huge demand, it will pay off. If you are one of 10 candidates for the job, watch the employer laugh and move on.  On a side note, it's worth bringing up that most professional athletes and actors are union members. Just saying."
networking,3bgf2a,FruitbatNT,3,Mon Jun 29 03:33:55 2015 UTC,"Agents absolutely exist for talented folks in engineering roles.  They're sometimes called agents, executive recruiters, or a host of other labels.  They brand themselves as marketing top talent to high paying clients and work closely with the engineers (the talent) to understand and accurately communicate their value and interests.  It's not nearly as common as sports, but it definitely exists.  People that are at the top of their game are at least aware of them, even if they don't use an agent personally.  See http://www.10xmanagement.com/ as one of many examples.  Haven't used that one personally, but I feel like I'm always seeing their recruiting ads.  On the flip side, many top engineers I've found seem to enjoy the personal connections and relationships enough to want to manage their own career directly.  Nothing wrong with that either -- just depends where you see your focus and priorities.  Disclaimer:  I'm an architect/consultant/engineer, not an agent/recruiter."

Union had him back the next day with full pay for the shift missed.  Same employee called in sick several times, boss ended up seeing his car at the local bar, goes in and sees him hammered, fires him again.

I can't specifically comment on your work environment but in my experience peer reviews and peer feedback to management go a lot further than an individual grandstanding. If you are in a functional team the management will want to see it work as such and may take a dim view on placing individual credit over the teams core purpose.  I am lucky enough to work in a team where we all have different strengths and as such have a solid peer review system into the management level.

The story of Joseph - After being sold into slavery by his jealous brothers (what a bunch of jerks), he quickly rose to a place of authority and trust, which from his actions it's reasonable to infer that he was an upright man not seeking his own glory, but to honor his God. The story of Daniel - You'd have to read more about him, but basically I'd say that he too was more concerned with doing what was right and good than gaining power, and yet because of this power was delivered to him."

It all depends on your environment. Where I work, outages are often complex and cause pain to potentially many thousands of people, so we don't fuck around. If I'm looking at an email thread and see them going the wrong direction, I tell them. If I'm on an outage bridge and I hear someone give bad information, I tell them, but I'm fairly senior and well respected already. That gives me a lot of latitude.

Now, more broadly I think this comes down to your manager (and their manager if appropriate). If your boss is the kind who monitors how these things go, you will get the credit. There may not be a ticker tape parade after the outage is resolved, but you'll know when review time comes around. And it may not be anything specific either. Your boss may just say ""AndyofBorg, you do a lot of good work around here and I notice that. Also $Boss's_Boss notices too."" Letting your work speak for itself has been, in my experience, the best way to go.  Now, if you have bad management I think you have already lost this one so you might as well get the outage resolved. Bad managers want someone to blame that isn't them. And if you own up to seeing something, but sitting on it (for whatever reason) you just might be that person. Even if it's not fair or accurate. Again, we're talking about bad managers here.  Finally, regardless of the disposition of your manager(s) you need your team and they need you. Having things to hold over each other isn't going to work long term.

networking,3bd75e,sedsnewoldg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the part where I'm a bad person.  I saw that this T-1 was bouncing but didn't have time to deal with it (it's not my job, I'm not in operations, but I don't consider myself above it by any means, I was hoping someone else might notice it, and if not I'd get to it soon). So when it shit the bed I was pretty sure it finally decided to give up the ghost. Most of the time a bad T-1 doesn't self-heal, it just bounces until it croaks completely.   Secondly, because it's a T-1, the provider has insight into the building side. Their ability to test to the smartjack gives a valuable second test point. Of course, if the building really lost power, the shelf might lose power also, and then you still might now know. Especially because they can probably see errors on the line, so even if the circuit is down, they can still see something coming from the other end, so it's powered on. This is not nearly so easy with ""real"" circuits that run on fiber, since when the building loses power, you probably can't get information from the NID.  Finally, since the T-1 was bouncing, it did come back up long enough for me to verify power. But mostly it was a hunch because I already knew the circuit was dirty. But then, he could have (and honestly, imo, should have) checked the T-1 router on our side."
networking,3bd75e,burbankmarc,2,Sun Jun 28 04:22:24 2015 UTC,"My approach is general to put something in the form of a question, and tag relevant people in the CC (ie your manager, the project manager, whatever).  So in this case....some email / whatever that basically states:   Agree that it looks like it could be a cause...but... Ask if they are sure its power / how did they reach that conclusion? Point out that you knew the circuit was having some issues for a while Point out that you talked to the provider and/or checked out the T1 on your side (not really clear which you verified) Suggest the action / method to do what you think is the missing step...OR...do that action and share results...whether this is show commands, before and after in a test env, etc. Some closing comment that you appreciate that theyre working on, you're just hoping to help or share experience etc.   The template of basically ""Good news, bad news, good news"" is always relevant here. IE - you made a good point, however I think this is worth looking into / you're wrong / here I am helping show you a better way, and then wrap up with something positive. At no point do you look like a total dick, youre including people who can commend you, youre showing that youre willing to help and share knowledge, and above all - you're helping fix a problem.   Sometimes people may take offense - but if you wordsmith your message appropriately - you should be 100% in the right. Sometimes situations will backfire and it turns out they were right and you were wrong and maybe things took longer ...be gracious and just say you were trying to ensure nothing was missed.   However in the end, as long as you really ARENT trying to undermine them and just trying to help - you should have no fear of reciprocation or negative results by trying to be helpful."

networking,3bbjn2,trendless,22,Sat Jun 27 17:22:43 2015 UTC,"That's akin to asking how much you pay for food. There are so many variables to factor in. If you're asking about port charges, leaving out loop costs....we pay about $750/Gb with Cogent, $1200/Gb with Comcast, $500/Gb with HE and $2500/L3."
networking,3bbjn2,kodiakinc,15,Sat Jun 27 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"this sounds about right.  My experience is a few years old, and my prices are something like 20% higher.    I've actually bought from cogent and HE, my l3 experience is all only quotes.     I'm currently paying like $700/month to he.net for a gig delivered to 55 s. market, but if I could negotiate hard (that is, if I was okay with them yonking the few hundred odd IPs I have from them)   I'm pretty sure I could get that down lower.    The other thing to consider is that in my experience, Cogent makes you buy more to get the minimum price, whereas he.net will give you a good price on a gig, or even 100mbps, but he.net will try to sell you a port-speed commit, while Cogent is happier with a 95th.      A 1g commit billed at the 95th on a 10g pipe is obviously much better than a 1g commit on a 1g port, because in the latter, you will start seeing latency and loss long before you hit your commit, whereas in the former, you can run right up to your commit and be just fine.  (and bursting!)  but...  A few years back, he.net charged you more for a 10g port, so you were better off aggregating 1g ports, while everyone else was happy to give you a 10g port.    this has probably changed by now.  Oh yeah. and all of these folks are professionals.   This means that if you use their IP addresses?  (e.g. if you have to renumber to leave)  don't expect the price to go down with market rates... they know it's hard to renumber, and they are going to capture some of that value.   At one point, my price went up by nearly a grand a  month for just IP addresses, because I told my provider (not one of the named providers, a smaller outfit)  just how difficult it was for a VPS provider to renumber.   Professionals;  capturing value, it's their job.     You want to counter this by having your own IP block and bgp announcing it out of two providers.   Good luck with that, of course, as ARIN recently ran out of IPv4.   In general, like all commercial leases, treat it like you are borrowing money for the lease term and paying up-front, and read your contract (take it to a lawyer if it's for money that you consider significant vs. the lawyer fee.)     They will send it to collections if you cancel early, and you know that auto-renewal?  of all the newbs I've known who have bought bandwith from  the higher-end players?   Yeah, like half of their cancellations at the end of the first term involved lawyers, because the company on the other end claimed they didn't get the cancellation on time, or that the email wasn't ""written notice"" or some other bullshit.     Of course, this is only an issue when you cancel, they're much cooler when you are upgrading."

networking,3bbjn2,kodiakinc,2,Sun Jun 28 11:32:04 2015 UTC,"Right now, if you are providing a hosting service, you either need IPv4 (preferably ipv4 and IPv6 at this point, and the IPv6 needs a bit of care and feeding to keep it from reducing reliability.)    or you need very technical customers who are willing to deal with the problems that going IPv6-only entails.     To be clear, the people willing and able to go IPv6 only do exist, but even those people probably want dual-stack for serious business.     Still, there's a lot that happens on the internet that isn't super-serious business, so I do believe there is room for an IPv6 only product, but you need to target your customers (so you get people who can deal with it)  and price it appropriately (for things that aren't serious business.)   IPv6 only, right now, would be wholly inappropriate if your customer base isn't technical enough to know what that means.    (Dual-stack, having IPv4 and IPv6, I think is appropriate for this at this point in time.  IPv6 has gotten a lot better, and now only very rarely breaks things that would otherwise have worked.)"

If you want to stay in a traditional infrastructure role for a bit then I'd definitely recommend security.

Palo Alto, F5 and others integrate with cisco ACI so a developer can provision a box, get connectivity to what he needs to and he doesn't have to worry about firewall rules, F5 config, vlans, routing - it's all automatic. These are things that junior network and security engineers traditionally did.  In my opinion it's a bad idea to just keep learning traditional networking. You're putting yourself in a shrinking industry. You're learning concepts and skills for an industry that is changing. All those skills you learnt - how different routing protocols work, subnetting, switching etc will be redundant in a SDN environment.  The uptake of SDN's won't be instant obviously, but there is no doubt in my mind that when it matures a little and businesses see the cost benefit then network engineering jobs will almost be non-existent and you'll have a few select seniors and no junior roles."

Think of the guys who only configured vlans of access switches back in the day. Those jobs don't exist anymore, but if they adapted with the times they are now doing more advanced stuff.   The other guy got lucky configuring that and once it was set up he didn't understand how to troubleshoot once it wasn't working. A need for the understanding of concepts is still there."

One of them bought it as a deal sweetener on a Nexus 9k deal.  It was so awfully, horribly, terribly broken that Cisco ended up giving them their money back on the ACI portion of the deal and they're just using the switches as a straight IP-Clos.  Another evaluated and went Contrail, hinting that ACI was terrible and they were glad they didn't buy it.    The third I know of has not started their NSX vs ACI bakeoff yet, but is planning to this summer.  So, that's 0 for 2 and 1 not yet started looking on ACI.

The bean counters/sales and CS people will be there to support your product instead of the other way around.   This is just one data point and my personal story so don't take it to seriously.

As I get older I value a company that will treat me like a human being and not overwork me into the ground. I would look at the big picture and factor in which company meshes with your interests and will help you develop the most. One thing to keep in mind is the ISP side tends to be hard work, more on call, more emergencies, etc. It also depends on your age and ambition level. I would probably let the quality of the company do more of the talking: how much vacation? will they pay for training? what kind of resources do they have? do they treat their employees well?

At an ISP you will be working with carrier networks that handle many many different customers. Planning and engineering will most likely be a bigger portion of the work at an ISP. You will learn how to make a rock solid network at an ISP. Enterprise networking will be a lot of last minute requests to perform miracles on bargain equipment for no thanks.  I would take the ISP job and learn everything you can get your hands on. If you can talk to customers then ask about their problems and how they use your data services.

As long as none of these are directly accessed using public IP addressing you can use what ever you want.   VLANs pare not going to reduce the number of IP addresses you use.  That is going to be equal to the number of end hosts you gave unless you want to use duplicates by using VRFs.  The only thing VLANs or VRFs will do is reduce your broadcast domain which is a good thing but you can give whatever IP addressing you want to your hosts as long as it is between 0.0.0.1 and 223.255.255.254.  The only reason to choose a specific range for a set of hosts is to make it easy to recognize a specific host and to not have to worry about leaking public IPs to your ISP. An ISP will drop any traffic than has a source IP that is private (RFC 1918).   For reference, I often use single digit octets for loopbacks on routers to make it easier to identify them (1.1.1.1 is R1, 2.2.2.2 is R2 etc)"

Under CIDR (which is how things have been done for many many years) you can have a /24 but you can just as easily have a /23 or a /22.  Here's a handy chart.    Remember that each 'network' has two more addresses than are usable- the first is the Subnet ID, the last is the broadcast address.  That's why 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255 are not usable for the standard /24. The same principle applies for CIDR blocks- for example, 192.168.1.32/27, aka 192.168.1.32 / 255.255.255.224, has a Subnet ID of 192.168.1.32, then usable IPs of 192.168.1.33-192.168.1.62, and a broadcast address of 192.168.1.63. This page will do those calculations for you.    That said- as others have suggested and you have agreed, just make some VLANs and use your routers to pass the traffic between them..."

We all know how bad its to stare into a 80km signal, wonder how fast you would damage your eyes if you accidently (or by purpose) stared into the optics of a 11909km signal?  The nice thing with this is that fewer amplify stations will be needed between two remote locations which gives lower latency (each time the signal must be retransmitted adds some latency)."
networking,3bbrq1,Apachez,5,Sat Jun 27 19:06:13 2015 UTC,An EDFA amplifier does not really retransmit the signal. It just boosts the light waves as they pass through the fiber.
networking,3bbrq1,kaaelhaa,2,Sat Jun 27 21:29:53 2015 UTC,Sorry forgot about those but you still get point of failures compared to the cable itself. You still need to get electricity to the amp stations every 80km or so (where every 11909km or so would be much nicer).
networking,3bbrq1,Apachez,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:38:08 2015 UTC,True.  I have seen studies in biasing the Erbium-doped fiber from long distance instead of where the EDFA sits. But I have no idea how far the development has come.

networking,3bbrq1,kombiwombi,2,Sun Jun 28 00:29:19 2015 UTC,I guess common sense doesnt count but sure there are more details to be explored before you jump on this boat.  I found this doc regarding latency of EFDA:  http://images.tmcnet.com/online-communities/dark-fiber/press/Optelian-Minimizing-Latency-in-Optical-Networks.pdf  which says that such amplifier adds 50-200ns per hop.  Comparing todays methods (assuming only EFDA amplifiers for this comparision) with a single 11909km link you would need at least 11909/80 - 1 = 148 such EFDA amplifiers along the road.  50 * 148 = 7400ns 200 * 148 = 29600ns  So you would avoid approx 7400-29600ns of latency unless this 11909km technology uses some bad magic which on its own adds more than the above latency to transmit an optic signal from point A to point B.  The main goal would most likely be that you wont need power to 148 places and by that lower the probability of the signal not reaching between point A and B (incl maintenance etc).  Edit: On the other hand I found this:  http://www.ti.rtu.lv/90080C.pdf  which claims 0.15us per EFDA amp (which shows that the previous example is closer to 200ns (0.2 mikroseconds) rather than 50ns (0.05 mikroseconds)).  So with 148 of those you get approx 22.2 mikrosecs of latency in one direction which then can get avoid (or 44.4 mikroseconds RTT).  As a comparision Arista claims 0.35 mikroseconds forwarding speed for their 7150S-24 boxes. So this would be like you had 64 of those boxes on your link which you now can remove (with the disclaimer that this 11909km tech doesnt perform any evil magic when it comes to latency)...

networking,3bal29,marvuozz,14,Sat Jun 27 10:40:42 2015 UTC,FYI Microsoft HIGHLY recommends you do NOT disable IPv6 on the interface. It will cause problems and some services could fail.
networking,3bal29,rnawky,2,Sat Jun 27 13:51:32 2015 UTC,"Got a link of this?  We do it as part of the server deployment process and haven't noticed any issues, but it's always good to learn new things."
networking,3bal29,youfrickinguy,7,Sat Jun 27 17:20:40 2015 UTC,"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/cc987595.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396  There's a lot of good info there. I've posted the most relevant one below.  Basically Microsoft doesn't run tests of their OS at all with IPv6 disabled. Disabling IPv6 is basically an unsupported configuration.  Our server guys love disabling IPv6 on the NIC too because they don't understand it. All I hear is ""dude pinging an IPv6 address is so hard because there's so many numbers!"" but the second I disable DNS for the company and tell him to ""just tell everyone to use IP addresses from now on"" their tone changes (obviously haven't really done this yet).  However whenever there's a ""networking problem"" I always check the server for disabled IPv6 first and tell them I can't proceed until it's turned on due to them running an unsupported Windows Server configuration. Dickish and unprofessional, perhaps. But so is disabling IPv6 due to not understand how it works (in my opinion).  Q. What are Microsoft's recommendations about disabling IPv6?  A. It is unfortunate that some organizations disable IPv6 on their computers running Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2008, where it is installed and enabled by default. Many disable IPv6-based on the assumption that they are not running any applications or services that use it. Others might disable it because of a misperception that having both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled effectively doubles their DNS and Web traffic. This is not true. From Microsoft's perspective, IPv6 is a mandatory part of the Windows operating system and it is enabled and included in standard Windows service and application testing during the operating system development process. Because Windows was designed specifically with IPv6 present, Microsoft does not perform any testing to determine the effects of disabling IPv6. If IPv6 is disabled on Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2008, or later versions, some components will not function. Moreover, applications that you might not think are using IPv6—such as Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, and Windows Mail—could be. Therefore, Microsoft recommends that you leave IPv6 enabled, even if you do not have an IPv6-enabled network, either native or tunneled. By leaving IPv6 enabled, you do not disable IPv6-only applications and services (for example, HomeGroup in Windows 7 and DirectAccess in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are IPv6-only) and your hosts can take advantage of IPv6-enhanced connectivity."

Probably. Are you safe from a determined attacker with a little bit of cash to hire time on a botnet? Doubtful. It's not difficult for someone these days to bring to bear a somewhat significant attack, and the prices are going down from what I understand as more botnet operators get into the game.   If your service provider sees a DDoS attack coming your way that doesn't max out your pipe they may still blackhole your traffic to keep the attack for persisting and possibly growing. Whether they do that or not depends on their policies and if you have some kind of arrangement with them for DDoS mitigation. I've heard some anecdotes about professional gamers having to work with their service providers to arrange DDoS mitigation because they are getting hit very often with persistent attacks. You're hedging your position with the fiber pipe, but if you're expecting a threat actor to attack you I suggest putting in a robust firewall as well."

networking,3bcyx1,MinimusNadir,4,Sun Jun 28 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"CPE is customer premise equipment.  The thing that plugs into the internet line.  Just because a device has gigabit ports on it does not mean it is capable of gigabit speeds.  When you connect through that thing, the CPU in it has to do stuff.  Processing and moving packets from one interface to another, updating state tables, etc.  Someone may be able to send lots of tiny packets, or packets with some TCP options set, or maybe fragmented packets that cause the CPU in it to have to work very hard to keep up.  That could result in someone being able to effectively take the router offline with a few hundred mbit/sec of traffic.    I don't have any specifics of that model as it is a consumer grade unit.  A rough example is Cisco makes the ASA line of enterprise firewalls.  The ASA 5515-X has a quad core 3ghz CPU and handles ~600mbit/sec of inspected traffic.  The ASA does far more than that Linksys, so it isn't an exact parallel.  Just be aware that even though it has gig ports it can't necessarily handle a gigabit of traffic under any or all conditions."

NTP and DNS recursion attacks are ""sourced"" from servers and routers in the internet that have a minimum of 1gbps internet access."

I'd throw in a couple of entries on the hosts file of each system just to make sure it's not something as stupid as failed DNS resolution.  Regarding the unidentified and limited networks, Windows does some checks regarding default gateways and, I think, Internet connectivity, so make sure you explicitly set your default gateway on the nodes (make it the other system if this is a simple p-t-p connection) and/or make sure DHCP (if you're using it in a LAN) is providing the correct one.

Traceroute works by sending packets with different TTL set. Each layer3 hop should decrease the TTL value in the packet (this way to avoid having packets spinning around in the networks forever). The device where TTL becomes 0 drops the packet and should return to the source ip in the packet with an icmp (ttl exceeded). Now which source ip is used for this icmp packet differs depending on vendor and model. Some use the ip on the link itself where the packet arrived at and some use the loopback interface (if such is configured).  Either way the result you see is within the same ISP you use thats why you will see a RFC1918 address since they use that either as loopback interface or as linknet for the p2p-links between their routers. Allowing RFC1918 within an ISP is perfectly fine, its at the border towards other ISPs you should filter packets who use RFC1918 as source ip (that is assume ntt.net would use 10.0.0.0/8 ip's for their links or loopbacks, in that case you should get * * * *  as ""reply"" for those hops since ntt.net is outside your current ISP (assuming that you dont have ntt.net as ISP but something else thats connected to ntt.net)."

networking,3bbtc6,Apachez,3,Sat Jun 27 19:27:37 2015 UTC,I would say its not uncommon to see that even if best practice is to use public ip-addresses for your links if you are an ISP. But then again depends on the gear you use regarding which source ip will be seen towards the client (the linknet or the loopback).  I would assume its more common for the loopback (which then also is used for mgmt traffic) to use RFC1918 than the links themselfs.  Within an enterprise I think its far more common to use RFC1918 addresses internally.  Also note now when more and more uses MPLS to hide the actual structure the traffic inside this MPLS could very well be public ip (basically your border routers) while the traffic outside the MPLS is then RFC1918 hop by hop.

I understand cyncism but OP's post is a bit too much so I feel the need to address it.   We're a software company and I truly believe we're the first residential router company to actually address real world problems. All other resdential routers just focus on improving bandwidth for wireless and wired throughput. This is ridiclous for so many reasons:   For nearly all connections (other than Singapore, HK) the bottleneck will be the broadband connection not the wifi/wired speed Most people don't do LAN 2 LAN traffic so again the high wifi speed is redudant Many papers have shown that the TCP buffers for most OS default setup will saturate way before speeds that high so unless you have multiple connections or are using a protocol that does you won't even use that speed Recent papers on google fiber have shown people don't even use the bandwidth when its available (incidentally I think the next killer app will be something that consumes bandwidth)   So just improving bandwidth at the physical layer will have pretty much no impact on a user's expierence, yet people don't seem cynical and you get monthly reviews praising the latest hardware which always puzzles me.    Instead we provide features that will make a difference, they work typically at higher layers i.e. network/transport and application layer. Anyway let me address the points that OP made.   My first reaction when i see ""Anti DDoS VPN"": ""This is awesome! Finally an ISP someone proposing DDoS Scrubbing as a service to consumers !""   If you use our VPN-Hybrid solution it is almost impossible for you to get DDoSed. Because:   The VPN will mask your IP so an attacker will never get your true IP Our DPI is extremely accurate (far more than just a regular expression on the first few packets), will classify game/stream traffic and make it bypass the VPN This means the game/stream servers that you connect to can see your true IP but they are run by Valve, Twitch, etc so you trust them   What's the benefit of this? The game/stream will not be hindered by the VPN (i.e. reduced bandwidth and higher latency) and furthermore if the VPN server is attacked your game/stream will continue to run. That is the most important thing for gamers/streamers and those are the people this feature is targeted at.    Anyone who can write <img src=yourserver:27014> can decloak you and hit your home.   We don't classify traffic by port number its DPI as mentioned above, so that would go through the VPN and therefore the IP would not be revealed ergo your game could not be attacked :)   QoS, that they call themselves ""broken"" in some of their blogs ""Anti-Flood"", basically RED as congestion control, in all likelyhood   RED is not a good QoS mechanism at all and it's pretty dated as well. There are far superior algorithms, in fact for higher speeds we use CODEL. Our algo for low speed connections (which need it the most) is not an AQM derivative and excels on all major metrics including packet loss, jitter, latency (obviously), responsiveness and fairness. Our customers have expressed how much they like it many times and we will soon publish a white paper with experiments which you can replicate yourself if you're so inclinded.    Network & Ping graphes, which are a standard thing nowadays   Not on console games which typically only show bars like a phone. For example for some very popular games the bars are differenitated at 100ms bands which is clearly very imprecise. So this feature is indeed very useful for console players to gauge the quality of the game connection.    ""One-click VPN"". In other words, run OpenVPN in Site-to-site mode without knowing about anything like MTU fragmenting your packets at application level and wrecking latency.   Its an OpenVPN client that is very simple to use. Most people/gamers don't have time or knowhow to install their own VPN client and setup the config files. We provide a one-click solution for them. This coupled with the exception list (and accurate classification using DPI as mentioned above) for the VPN-Hybrid means you can benefit from the VPN without the drawbacks (e.g. you can still watch HD YouTube on your tablet and still be VPNd on other traffic).    Geo-Filter, Deny and Allow: Refuse connections on a Geo basis so that game servers try and retry until they find someone close to you. Seriously ?! You can't just do that on the Internet...   You cannot filter by distance on any router in the world. It is actually an extremely difficult task to implement on a router. Try compress a full IP database into 3mb that must remain compressed when doing lookups & furthermore lookups must be submillisecond. Not easy at all.    ""Powerful hardware"": a 60$ Mikrotik Routerboard, 600 Mhz MIPS with full software processing, they didn't even bother changing the case   The next free upgrade allows gigabit LAN<->WAN throughput which is the switch speed so I'd say that is powerful.  Furthermore we're a software company that provides functional benefits for our users. So why on earth would we change the case? That's what I don't understand about the criticism, people like OP accuse it of being trite but then they want things like a case with go faster stripes? Very puzzling to me.    Certainly not ""R&D, Legal and Patents"" as they told me...   I don't understand how you can claim that legal, R&D and patents are not expensive? They are very expensive.   I'm going to leave it here, my expierence with some users on Reddit is that they just want to argue ad infinitum. I've made my points hopefully that helped clear that up for some people out there.

networking,3b820t,chrtr,0,Sat Jun 27 11:27:42 2015 UTC,"Hello, Thanks for taking the time to answer ! I'm sorry if my post was.. somewhat aggressive. As I said in the comments, I do understand that there is a market for such devices, and that they can indeed help deflect a fair share of DDoS attacks on gamers.  What I'm however having trouble with, and that's what made me fly over the edge as someone working in networking, is the way it's being marketed as a ""bulletproof magic-box"". Because I don't believe that can be the case, for reasons following.  Let me retake the points i brought up here and in comments, and attempt to explain my views differently.   Improving throughput on LAN is ridiculous   I agree, and I'm actually glad someone finally had the presence to put some extra intelligence in consumer devices.    RED is dated, we use CODEL   I just threw RED out there because it's the first thing that came to my mind when reading about the details on your website, sorry about that. Don't many router boxes already use CODEL though ?   Geo-Filter: ""You can't do that on the Internet"" ""Not easy at all""   I concurr that doing so on a limited memory device and in realtime is an impressive feat. Only, dropping connections seemingly randomly sounds like a poor networking practice.   Powerful Hardware   Again, this is pretty much a baseless rant on my part. I personally plead in favor of Mikrotik for consumer uses, but it's pretty ironic when they are considered very poor by most people in networking.   R&D and patents are expensive   Sorry, I didn't mean it that way, I do know how expensive R&D costs can be. However this answer left me in disbelief cause i've always been told a fair share of the european countries do not allow Software patenting.   Our DPI is extremely accurate  We do not classify traffic by port   VPN-Hybrid  more than just a regular expression on the first few packets   I'm sorry, this part I just cannot buy though....  I had thought you'd use DPI initially, but there's a very simple reason that makes it impossible to use DPI to route..   I tried asking on Twitter for more information about it as it intrigued me, and since Faser eagerly (and very professionally) answered to my first sarcastic comment and said he'd be happy to answer any technical question. Sadly, i didn't get any answer..   Now, you'll probably ask me, why are you saying can't you route based on Layer 7 ?  Take a TCP Stream. Establishing it requires a 3-way-handshake. The router receives the SYN packet, and has to make a routing decision. What does it contain ? Source/Dest IP/Port. That's pretty much it. The router has to route it now, or the connection won't be established at all, and there is no Layer 7 data to inspect.  Let's say it runs the packet through the direct link. Handshake completes. Now the router remarks through DPI this is actually HTTP traffic and RST the stream. It's too late: you're already decloaked, you sent a SYN with your IP...  Let's say the router runs the packet through the VPN instead. Handshake completes. Now the router remarks through DPI this is actually game traffic. However, because the stream is already established, it can't switch routing and outbound IP, that'd break it (ah, if only, the wonders of SCTP..)...  Now someone will certainly be telling me, ""Most games don't use TCP, we can just VPN it all"". Bear in mind that this means you have a different IP for UDP and TCP game traffic. If you've ever been behind a Revolving NAT Pool, or if you've tried to mess with networking on games, and especially both, you can see how slippery it is to appear with multiple IPs to game servers.  Of course, there could be an alternative, but it's not routing. The only possible thing I could see would be fully-transparent layer 4 proxying -- in a way similar to 'connection accelerators' used in Sattelite Connections endpoints, that allow to bypass the effect of sattelite round-trip-time on TCP. And even that isn't perfect for DPI, because if any underlying protocol makes the assumption the server talks first, you're toast.  Also, there's the problem of SSL. How can you do any DPI at all on traffic behind a SSL Handshake ? Many games run SSL over 27014-50, to take a random example, Saints Row 4. Or do you filter based on SNI alone ?  Don't get me started either on how the whole concept could fall apart as soon as you're playing on non-official servers. For being Net staff at a LAN, i've had more than once people ask me to open specific ports because they were using alternate matchmakings for competitive training. Either then your traffic is ran through VPN and you get poor latency, or you risk running it to private servers and having your IP exposed.  Also, you didn't comment on the issues coming from MTU when VPN'ing a LAN. I suspect that's why some of your customers are complaining about poor bandwidth through VPN.   TL;DR: To me, it looks like you're trying to sell it as a magic bullet, when it clearly isn't. That's what got me somewhat angry, and i'm sorry as I went a bit overboard in the initial post.  And if you made it to this line, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read through my reply, despite all my ranting :)"

We're patent(s) pending in US and we will expand to rest of the world through what I believe is called the 'Paris Treaty' (I can't remember if this is the right term, I'm not a lawyer!).  There is a huge debate on whether patents are legal or not in software as it can be seen as Maths (and therefore is discovered not invented). Personally I wish we didn't need to do it but we're so small we need to protect ourselves.    Only, dropping connections seemingly randomly sounds like a poor networking practice.   The Geo-Filtering occurs on the connection establishment stage. We never interrupt a connection half way through. In fact once a connection starts you can't filter it out till its terminates itself. We did this to stop people using it to cheat in game (by reducing their distance once playing).  The Geo-Filter is probably our most popular feature. When you see the reviews on our site many of them are discussing the Geo-Filter. I guess because its the most ground-breaking or significantly different. Also it really really does make a big difference. I speak from experience I used to play Halo 3 a lot and playing in the UK on a US host was heartbreaking lol. Propagation delay is definitely the most dominant factor in latency (unless the link is saturated of course).   I tried asking on Twitter for more information about it as it intrigued me, and since Faser eagerly (and very professionally) answered to my first sarcastic comment and said he'd be happy to answer any technical question. Sadly, i didn't get any answer..   Sorry he didn't reply, we try to respond to all comments. Sometimes we miss them sadly as we get quite a few notifications a day.    The router receives the SYN packet, and has to make a routing decision. What does it contain ? Source/Dest IP/Port. That's pretty much it.    Firstly games mostly use UDP so there is a payload in the first packet. Incidentally if Fast TCP becomes widely adopted so will TCP.   The DPI we do is throughout the entire game but that is for other features like the ping stats during the game. We do however classify the traffic based on the first packet. That way the entire traffic of the flow will bypass the VPN.   Don't get me started either on how the whole concept could fall apart as soon as you're playing on non-official servers.    This leads me onto why our DPI is relatively advanced. We don't just do regular expressions but we fully understand the protocol (in fact we sort of replicate it in the machine) so its extremely unlikely it will be misclassified.  The cool thing about that is we know the difference between competitive matches and casual matches. In the next upgrade I'm going to update the CS:GO VPN-Hybrid classification to only work with competitive games(which have to be hosted by Valve servers).   Also, there's the problem of SSL. How can you do any DPI at all on traffic behind a SSL Handshake ?    We only do VPN-Hybrid DPI  for source engine games and LoL at the moment. For other games you'd have to go for port based method. However I assume DDoS is not such a big issue for other games.   Also, you didn't comment on the issues coming from MTU when VPN'ing a LAN. I suspect that's why some of your customers are complaining about poor bandwidth through VPN.   Sorry I missed your MTU point. To answer your question I wasn't aware of that. I'll do some research into it and hopefully address it on our next update. I assume the VPN encapsulating means that large packets will end up being fragmented. As it mostly impacts TCP flows you could do some MSS clamping on the fly for VPN traffic. Anyway I'll need to do some research.  We're constantly evolving the product, it's part of our strategy to try always be ahead of potential competition as we can't compete on marketing/budget. Anyway we've done 10 updates (there pretty big as well) since we launched in last Dec. I will definitely look into the MTU issue and thanks for letting me know (it's been added to our development ticket system).  Hope that helps, Iain"
networking,3b820t,Cantbelieve123,3,Sat Jun 27 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"It does :) Thanks for the precisions   We only do VPN-Hybrid DPI for source engine games and LoL at the moment  We do however classify the traffic based on the first packet   I do understand UDP is a PITA to DPI-Route, though replaying the game protocol sounds very impressive indeed ! Is the protocol spec open ? If not, did you manage to get an accord with the editors, or reverse it by hand ?  How do you handle the TCP part specifically though ? Or is there simply no TCP at all in Source games and LoL currently ? If there's any, do you VPN-it-all for safety despite issues it can cause on some game, proxy it, or IP/port filter it ? I think it's pretty important as it's very telling of how robust in IP Masking the whole Hybrid thing is. For example, what'd happen if i do the <img> thing above with port 2099 (LoL TCP PvP.net) ?   MSS Clamping   Indeed, MSS Clamping is the way to go I believe ! It wouldn't be too perfect in most cases, because it doesn't work on UDP and other protocols, but since in your precise case almost all UDP traffic wouldn't run through VPN, it's probably good enough. Could also try advising users to use comp-lzo on OpenVPN if that's not already the case.   As I said in some comments, the whole MTU thing is pretty vicious under OpenVPN : contrary to IPSec/GRE/IP-IP where it causes actual IP Fragmentation, OpenVPN just fragments at application level, so it works all the same, just slower.  For reference, i've had a friend trying to run site-to-site VPN over a 100 Mbps consumer line recently and tried to help him troubleshoot the MTU problem. His testing was in a nutshell bare HTTP-on-TCP throughput through Speedtest: (disclaimer: i don't remember about precise numbers, this is more of a rough indication)   25 Mbps with OpenVPN and 1500 MTU causing app-level frag Nothing working properly with GRE and 1500 MTU (probably fragments being dropped somewhere) 35 Mbps with OpenVPN and 1400 MTU (no frag then) 90 Mbps with GRE and 1400 MTU   For some reason OpenVPN was real slow in his case, even though he was using a EdgeRouter that is supposed to be somewhat beefier (Dual Core 500 Mhz MIPS, 512 MB RAM). GRE offered much higher perfs, i assume because of kernel-level processing and the fact there's no encryption or application-level protocol (shift the payload, add in the header, done!)... But still, MTU played a part on OpenVPN throughput.   Again, i'm sorry if i caused trouble, and hope you guys can manage to improve your product further ;) Good luck."

I actually think this would work quite well to help prevent the typical Twitch-style DDoS attack--people use your Skype handle to find your IP and then hammer it killing your game so they can win. Skype would be running through the tunnel so if they DDoS'd you using that IP the only thing they could take down is your VPN connection not your game. In fact, if it was tunneling all non-gaming traffic it would actually work to prevent unmasking your home address in the exact scenario you gave in your criticism (using an image fetch to connect to a server you control). That would go through the tunnel too.  The idea is that nothing but gaming traffic ever goes through with a source of your IP, the rest goes through the tunnel. It prevents you from accidentally disclosing your last mile IP address.  Also pre-configured QoS isn't a terrible thing for a home user. Hell I like to think I know what I'm doing and I can barely get it working sometimes.

If you also include DPI you can cut down on management overhead by parse DNS requests and building your ACL dynamic (or snooping whatever mechanism steam uses to discover and authenticate it's steam server--I doubt it's just blindly downloading files willy nilly).   You guys are way overthinking this. It's meant to prevent against 13 year old script kiddies who fuck with people on CS:GO. Even something super basic is probably going to foil 90%+ of ""attacks"".

An immediate thought is to write a simple phpinfo() call into a webpage and run it on port 27015 and redirect the user to that address, which would capture their WAN IP.  I simply feel using DPI to route traffic over a VPN is any sort of DDoS protection or mitigation or anything.

All you can do is make a routing decision for the whole stream based on the first packet exclusively... In case of TCP that's often a SYN without any actual information about the underlying application other than port numbers.   Why am I saying this ? It's simple, data isn't flowing until the connection is established, so how can you use it to route the whole connection ? And it's not like you can magically change the interface to balance things on mid-connection, that'd break it.  Long story short, unless they're doing full application proxying in a way similar to Sattelite Internet connection accelerators, that completely break a lot of fundamental principles (like getting a RST when you hit a closed port), they can't even do more than Layer 4."

While they can be made to bridge, and even drop all connected hosts onto a specific VLAN for you, that is not their default behavior.  My personal theory on why this otherwise counter-intuitive behavior is the default is as follows:  First, Meraki solutions are meant for a broad audience.  The less technically-inclined of their customers will appreciate this ""it just works(tm)"" functionality out of the box, and those more technical customers will have no problem changing these defaults, so nobody loses out there.  Secondly, and probably most importantly, Meraki and the like have all sorts of extra packet shaping and filtering functionality built into their cloud service.  These types of functions require the AP to be the gateway, otherwise they would have no direct control over the packet flow.  tl;dr: the fancy value added features of Meraki cloud controller and the like can't work unless the AP is also the gateway."

I see that there's a lot of conflicting information about this specific matter, so I decided to look into it a little further to explain the discrepancy.  It turns out you're right!  By default, they do come in bridged mode, and do indeed still offer the stateful packet inspection functionality when in that mode.  It turns out that some of Meraki's sales partners perform ""value-added"" benefits to their customers, including engineering the wireless network solution for them.  That is what we ended up doing at our company, so by the time I saw the Meraki cloud instance for our company, everything was in routed+NAT mode, as I described above.  I was also led to believe by our ""value-added reseller"" that this configuration was set up as such to allow greater visibility via stateful packet inspection, which led me to the assumption that this functionality hinged on the devices being in that mode.  So, I appreciate you pointing out the error!  I hope that clears things up for some of the other readers,as it did for me.  This Reddit thing is alright. :D"

Hint: NAT only works when the machine behind the NAT (aka within the WiFi) initiates a connection to go outside the NAT (aka LAN). If you try to reach anything behind a NAT from outside, it won't work, because you NATing instance doesn't have any rules for that.  The point of NAT is to have one outside address and many inside addresses. E.g. one public internet IP-Address and a whole 10.0.0.0/8 subnet. The clients withing the 10.0.0.0/8 can initiate connections to the internet. But the internet can't reach any clients within your 10.0.0.0/8."

The function is still pretty limited for the use case you are trying to use.  99% of the users aren't going to be initiating code pulls from a switch to their laptop and you generally aren't going to be running server stuff off the AP (just an assumption).

networking,3b9lu5,nswizdum,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:23:26 2015 UTC,Does the audio always drop in the same direction? If so then it is most likely a routing issue. If you are using IP endpoints(IP Phones/ATAs) then both of the end points need to have routes to each other. This is due to the face that the RTP stream will flow directly between the endpoints.
networking,3b9lu5,timberwolf1128,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:36:29 2015 UTC,Tends to be a firewall issue. When a call is made the RTP stream is initiated by the two end points to each other via a call setup request from the call manager. Make sure the firewall rules allow each side to initiate the connection. Typically site a can connect to site b but because the connection from b to a is not a direct response to that connection the firewall will drop it. The rules must permit traffic each way. A secondary cause would be asymmetric routing which would similarly cause the firewall to drop the traffic because it is not seen as a reply to initiated traffic.
networking,3b9lu5,AndyofBorg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:48:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting, so would you suggest maybe making an ACL on both routers to allow the RTP ports (20000 to 20999) in from the WAN IP of the other router to the LAN IPs where the phones will be?  For example, router A: Action: allow; service: UDP: 20000-20999; source interface: WAN; source: <router B external IP>; destination: ANY  I'm assuming this should work since, like you said, the party that initiated the call is getting their packet stream through, but the response stream was originally getting dropped, which this rule should allow the response stream to pass through the firewall untouched.  Am I thinking this through correctly?  There's also an IPS feature enabled that may be causing more harm than good...that's the only other thing that's standing out to me anyway."
networking,3b9lu5,AndyofBorg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:54:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply, but remember, VoIP calls are endpoint to endpoint.  Your firewall/routers/tunnels need to allow Phone1IP to Phone2IP, and vice versa. You should not be NATing the traffic. NAT will play havoc with voice calls. You have to do special things like STUN or even a SIP type of firewall/gateway to handle that stuff. I don't really want to get into it, it gets into ALG stuff (application layer gateway).  The main thing is, to make sure the traffic between voice endpoints is not run through NAT and that both sides allow the traffic straight through."
networking,3b9lu5,Skilldibop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"maybe I'm understanding IPSEC incorrectly, but I always thought when the tunnel was created, all traffic flowing between sites was encapsulated and decapsulated in a way that no NAT traversal happens when going from a 192.168.0.20 address to a 192.168.2.20 address on separate /24 networks.   Not at all. If the IPSec VPNs are policy based, I.E there is no 'Tunnel interface', then NAT policies will be applied and you will need to put a NAT exception statement or ""NO-NAT"" into the NAT rules to tell it not to process traffic between those internal networks."

networking,3b6uya,nativevlan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:04:03 2015 UTC,"If you're seeing the magic packet hit another host on the same subnet, this is unlikely a network problem. Power your target host on and check Wireshark/tcpdump straight from that machine to confirm whether the packet is reaching the host.  Certain hosts and certain NICs are very picky about WOL. What OS is the target machine and what is the brand/model of the NIC?  As an example, last time I worked with WOL was with some Dells running Win8. I came across two issues - Win8 has certain sleep/hibernate settings which are entirely incompatible with WOL, and the NIC in these machines needed different firmware to support WOL properly."

I followed this guide: http://ephingadmin.com/a-configmgr-admins-guide-to-wol-magic-part-two/   All tho I do not use config manager I could use all the scripts described in this blogpost.  The part about EnablePME is the most cruicial to me since all my PCs use a Intel NIC.  And another thing to remember is that if Windows is not shutdown correctly then WOL doesn't work because Windows tells the NIC what to listen to when the PC is shutdown. It can listen for both Magic Packets and Patterns.   //Anders

networking,3b86fx,VA_Network_Nerd,2,Mon Jun 29 15:18:19 2015 UTC,"Be careful with MST if you're changing root priorities.  Cisco MST to legacy STP interop will not allow the root bridge to be in the STP domain, it must be in the MST domain (specifically the Internal Spanning Tree - IST - Root).  The end result is that the links from MST facing legacy STP will get blocked if the root is in legacy STP (PVST simulation failure).   Basically you can blackhole traffic if you don't migrate it correctly.  You need to start at the MST IST root and migrate out from there.  We have a detailed writeup on these cases here - Understanding MSTP"
networking,3b86fx,VA_Network_Nerd,3,Mon Jun 29 16:28:29 2015 UTC,"Its best if the STP root is co-located with the default-gateway.    So lets say switch A and B are the HSRP gateways for VLANs 5, 10, 15 and 20. Lets say switches C and D are the HSRP gateways for VLANs 7, 12, 17 and 22.    I am assuming you are using Cisco, or cisco-like switches.    I assume Switch A and C are the HSRP primaries for the switch-pairs.    This will first set the STP priority to 16384 for all VLANs. Then sets the STP priority to a very low value of 8192 for the HSRP Primary VLANs. Then sets the STP priority to a medium-low value of 12288 for the HSRP secondary.    Dumb switches generally default to STP priority 32768, so they will always defer to one of these configurable devices as the root bridge.  If I sat and thought about it more, I could probably reduce the syntax redundancy.  But this should work.

networking,3b86fx,robertj180,3,Sat Jun 27 02:42:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, objective is move to the root nearest to the SVI as possible. Sometimes its my switch sometimes its a firewall. Part of my problem is that over the years people have dual homed pizza box switches to different pairs of core switches. If I set root on CORESWITCH1/2 for VLAN 100 and PIZZABOX1 is connected to CORESWITCH1/2 and CORESWITCH3/4 does the change nor propagate across PIZZABOX1 to CORESWITCH3/4? Vlan 100 is potentially a different layer 3 network on CORESWITCH1/2 and CORESWITCH3/4.  Does that example make sense?"
networking,3b86fx,X-Istence,2,Fri Jun 26 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"Lets use the example above, and instead of VLAN 100 lets go with VLAN 10.    Pizzabox switch ""E"" has hosts connected that are members of VLAN 10.    It should have been uplinked to A and B, in our example.    But instead it was mistakenly uplinked to switches B and C.    What will happen?    B still has the lower (better) priority, so the packets will flow that way. I assume there is a link, or port-channel connecting A and B, so the packets wil enter B and flow to A for servcie by the HSRP primary.  Less efficient, but valid.    The alternate STP root port is C.    But if you are saying that C & D might also have a VLAN 10, that is a completly different subnet than the VLAN 10 on Switches A&B then your topology is right & proper fucked up.

Unless you are using bidirectional optics,  you are talking about a pair of fibers and two unidirectional paths.   dBm is a measure of power referenced against 1mW of power. A dB is logrithmic unit of measure,  so each 3db change is half of the power.  The power loss over the fiber span is simple math, A-end TX dBm minus Z-end RX dBm.    Mars TX (0.73dBm) - Jupiter RX (-16.55dBm) = 17.28dB (not dBm)  The -40dBm on Mars' RX is a false reading, notice the 0mW?  A lot of gear does this,  mine included. Jupiter is not receiving anything it can actually measure.   First, best practice is to use the same optics on both sides,  since all fibers in the same path should have similar span loss.  Second,  your lead engineer is full of it.   Easy troubleshooting?  Switch the fibers on both ends.  The problem should switch direction.    Correct troubleshooting?

And finally which connectors you will use (no matter if its a temporary or fixed installation).

networking,3b7bts,Sp4rt4n423,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:17:30 2015 UTC,"First of all the price is about the same these days. But then it comes to compatability...  With multimode your are limited in length (50 meter - 2km depending on speed and optics being used) where a singlemode fixed installation can be just patched into another singlemode installation and then you can use optics for up to (normally) 80km in the ends. Singlemode will also work just fine for shorter distances when using 10km optics.  Then with multimode you also have the various quality settings to obey... so you wanted to run 10Gbps with your multimode OM1 installation? Bummer... you need at least OM3 to do so for any length longer than 50 meter or so. Also dont forget the 50um vs 62.5um thingy.  Also the day your fixed installation doesnt cut it (in terms of interfaces) you can grab a set of passive multiplexing (CWDM?) and just plug that into a pair of singlemode fiber, I dont think that works with multimode.  So in short - singlemode is superior to multimode att basically all parameters (the pros are far greater than the only con which is that singlemode is slightly more expensive but the difference is small today).  Its similar to if you would use CAT5E or CAT6 (or higher) for a fixed RJ45 installation? I doubt anyone (mentally sane =) would argue to use CAT5E as a new installation today."

networking,3b7bts,Sp4rt4n423,2,Fri Jun 26 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"Ah! that explains your confusion, it's just not your area of expertise. No big deal, i'll try to ELI5 it better and answer some of your miscellaneous questions. On a network switch, you're used to seeing an RJ-45 jack that a Cat5 or 6 cable would plug in to. Fiber doesn't use those - it needs what's called an SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable) port. You can check to see if your network switches have that capability. Usually they will look like an open square port to the right of the RJ-45 ports (they might have plugs on them). In to these you have to plug a transceiver, which might be referred to as an SFP module or a ""mini-GBIC"". The reason these aren't built in like the RJ-45 plug is because you use different transceivers depending on the type of cable. Here's a bunch of images so you know what I'm talking about.  This is where the single-mode vs. multi-mode comes in to play. It basically has to do with the diameter of the glass core that is transporting the light used to transmit your data. Single-mode has a much smaller diameter, so the light can only travel down in the core of it and doesn't bounce around, so it is faster and can travel longer distances. Multi-mode has larger diameter cores so some of the light bounces and some travels in a more direct line - that's the ""modes"" we're talking about. While single mode is definitely superior, the tiny cores make it significantly more expensive to deploy. For you application, multi-mode will work if cost is a factor. If that's what you decide to go with, look for SX transceivers and ask for 50/125 multi-mode cabling (that's a 50 micron core and 125 micron sheath), OM2 or OM3 - I'd recommend OM3. OM2 is sufficient at that distance for 1 GB data rates. If you want to future proof more for 10 Gb or faster, you need to step up to OM3 or OM4, or step up to single-mode. The OM3 and OM4 ratings basically means the manufacturer used lasers to optimize the cables.  Hope that helps! To recap, my recommendation for the best price/performance is to lay down OM3 50/125 multi-mode fiber and get SX transceivers for your switches."

You need to install surge suppressors on both ends of that line and (ideally) install a fiber gap between the connected terminals on either and and whatever the next hop is to the rest of the network.  That aside, since you don't want to buy a fiber cable, you might be able to find and bury a small PoE-powered switch so that you don't have to run a power line out to the middle of the parking lot.  I'm not sure if any vendors make gigabit PoE switches, but I have seen 100mbps switches that are PoE powered.  This is not recommended.  It's important to note that if your intent is to run 10gbps across that Cat6 line, you need a 10gbps switch every ~150ft down that line (Cat6 is only rated for 10g at 50m, while Cat6a can do 10g across 100m).  I'd create vaults in the parking lot that you can access and that have enough headroom to install a full rackmount-sized switch so you have room to accommodate changing sizes of equipment in the future.

Some of this is to provide easy ability to pull/repull new cables in the future.  This is also to protect the cable -- between using conduit and the proper burial depth, your network link will stand a much better chance of surviving if someone drives a too-heavy truck across that parking lot, when the area gets flooded, etc.  Also, in the beginning, pull at least 2 lines if you plan to need one active -- it provides a dark fiber you can easily light up for more capacity later, and also acts as a spare to switch over to if the first fiber fails.  For extra bonus reliability, run these in two separate parallel conduits.  To go really over the top use geographic path diversity to ensure maximum reliability (i.e. two paths between the buildings, each exit point located far from the other, with paths that are far apart so that a single catastrophic event is unlikely to affect both paths).  This is datacenter-level reliability, so YMMV, just putting it out there to consider depending on the criticality of the network to the business and the risk involved."

Or at least you can on aruba, not sure about unifi.  Anyway, that essentially ""disables"" 802.11b and by not allowing clients to associate to the AP at those lower speeds, your hemming up the farthest reaches of your cell - where the slowest clients might be.  God forbid you have joe at a transfer rate of 802.11g @ 2mb/s trying to stream a netflix video - he's gonna eat up a fair amount of airtime.

As others have said, if you don't need dynamic VLANs you might be OK. That said, I really want to move to Ruckus, as their radio technology is ahead of Ubiquiti for beam forming and AP density. Their new ""small business"" Xclaim line may work for you, but has some odd limitations at present. (For instance, initial setup requires pairing with one iOS device.)

You generally want to stay away from their newest kit for awhile and let other users find the bugs.   Their UAP-Pro APs were really buggy and had a lot of performance issues when they were first released, and it looks like the same thing is happening with their 802.11 AC APs.  That being said, it is a very cost effective way to get uniform wireless management implemented and should at the very least be a large step up from individually managed autonomous APs.  BTW, Unifi isn't going to help you much when it comes to rogue APs and DHCP servers.   You will want to have at least some form of basic switching gear that allows you to perform DHCP snooping, and you should talk to management about getting policies implemented that forbid users from performing this sort of activity."

You need a firewall, a managed switch, and a wireless system. I'm recommending a HP Procurve (one of the rebranded 3coms), a ubiquiti edgerouter, and a 3-pack of ubiquiti unifi AP's.  The HP Procurve supports DHCP snooping, so you can use it to block rogue DHCP servers, and it has MSTP to detect and shutdown loops.

networking,3b5gcf,ariadisorbetto,2,Fri Jun 26 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"I talked to customer support yesterday about this. I was able to verify on my own via VPN that its just effecting LA area (Tested connections around the world - worked no problem & our cell phones connect no issue as well).  Time Warner Cable (the 2nd tier customer service representative) told me that they don't deal with website issues and since I can visit a website, my connection is working. He got mad when I explained to him that there is a blockage between those Google scripts and me, that seems to be only effecting the IP range in the LA Area. I tried to explain that the main page, he was visiting didn't have the script hence why it loaded no problem.  Rebooted my modem / router; no joy.  Looks like at least some of Time Warner Cable realizes it is an issue effecting their side.  ""We are aware of the issue and working toward a resolution, however, no ETR is available at this time.

No pursuit of CCIE? Also it sounds like you might not be where the jobs are. That is a challenge right now which is preventing many people from buying a home. It can be somewhat easy to find ""great"" jobs if you're willing to move all over the country. You get your couple years experience and move on to the next job/state. Are you willing to expand your job search to the entire country and move your family?  I have Linux, coding, and networking experience. I'm qualified for most ""DevOps"" jobs. I might move in that direction but I'm fairly certain 90% of the positions are ""we expect you to do 3 jobs."" Just left a support position that paid extremely well. Are you able to talk to people without enraging them? Customer support skills?  I'm sure there are a ton of technical sales positions you could get if you want to go that route. You can earn more than you've ever imagined too."
networking,3b5wpe,nospyingpls,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:26:36 2015 UTC,Completely agree regarding the CCIE R&S. These days it is even easier to get practice gear with virtual routers and stuff. ( i would use virtual routers and physical switches).  It also show's on your CV that you are not stagnating. Same goes for other vendor training or even something more left field like one of the Coursera mini degree's.

It is kinda a meaningless bone they threw to the entry level crowd since it doesn't allow you access to higher level certs.   I should not bother attempting a higher level cert without any real world   You really shouldn't attempt ANY higher level cert without real world or you'll only hurt yourself and fail at interviews.  A VCP is valuable to a lot of people but only for Virtualization heavy jobs but that is out of your reach since I doubt you will pay for the training class out of pocket and the test is a bastard. Also you would continue to be a paper cert if you somehow got it.  Saying that if your CCNP is still active (and you know what your doing) then having that on your resume for 15 years in NOC positions looks decent enough to someone seeking a intermediate level guy. Probably best to seek a junior to int network role and see if you can get some virtualization stuff as you go."

I am willing to move again for the right opportunity but, I need to be able to maintain my families quality of life... I can't park my kids in an unsafe neighborhood to improve my career.

networking,3b5wpe,rtechie1,2,Fri Jun 26 11:41:00 2015 UTC,"If the IE is not doable fair enough it takes a lot of commitment.  Now as to the paper cert question that one really depends. If you are refreshing yourself or using some knowledge every day then you are not a paper NP.  For example I used to do Martial Arts in a strict organization and reach one below black belt before a knee injury stopped me. I have not been able to train since. Although i know how to do certain things and exploit weakspots, position correctly and all that Jazz i would not call myself a martial artist.  Now lets say i stuck around the club and helped with teaching and mentoring and what not then i think i still could call myself one even if personally i am stopped by injury.  Without seeing your CV it is hard to tell but it looks like you are fairly stagnant and moving as jobs dry up. If you are in a managed services company R&S engineers are a dime a dozen and can be easy to offshore. Have you thought of a track change to something like wireless? you need to give them a reason not to drop you instead of someone else.  Other things include being proactive, what is the biggest problem you face internally day to day? Can you fix it? What are your relationships with customers like? What are your internal relationships like?  I have taken a swipe at another team internally for sub standard work that led to me being put on a tiger team of sorts and now i get to do internal work as well as customer facing. When i meet new people including people in upper management for the first time they often say ""oh your /u/NotHyplon ? I heard about that thing you did with X""  If you find some bottleneck internally or something that can be done different to save\make money they are unlikely to chop you over someone else."

networking,3b5wpe,Cheeze_It,2,Fri Jun 26 20:07:36 2015 UTC,"because my only real world experience was stuck at Layer 2   This is a big problem this far into your career.   I'm going to assume you want to stick with network engineer, which means there are two paths forward. Neither is easy:  1) ISP. You work for an ISP/datacenter/hosting provider. This is the land of MPLS, high-end routing protocols, provisioning lots of OC-3s, etc.   It is very, very hard get experience in this tech if you don't start junior and work up. It's hard to mock up this stuff in the lab and the gear is too expensive to buy yourself and play around with.   If you won't take a pay cut, this probably isn't an option. This is less in my wheelhouse so someone else can probably say more.   2) Enterprise networking. Time to learn Linux.   The other path for someone that knows layer 2, the one your are thinking about, is enterprise networking. I think this makes a lot more sense. Mainly because you can learn much of what to need to on your own.   So what so you need?  If you haven't already, buy a used Cisco router and switch and Aironet hotspot with IOS on eBay and start creating scenarios. Buy the physical gear. People will tell you just to use the simulators and they are wrong. Not knowing the gear just exposes your ignorance.   Second, Linux. You will have to deal with this. You should look into formal training. Since you don't have it at work, move everything at home to Linux.  Now that you have a few Linux boxes, you can start running networking tools on them. You're going to be dealing with a lot of Linux-based appliances in enterprise networking."

Saying that you have a colleague that is head and shoulders smarter than you is kind of a self-downer. You can't allow for that attitude to permeate you like that. You need to see what the market demands and decide if you want to learn to meet that demand. There's always a demand for good IT people. At the current moment though you need to show people you can kick ass.   Same job for 15 years with nothing more to show for it than a lapsed CCNP to me says you have other things that you're doing and that you're doing your job well enough to stay where you are but not to excel. Management/HR only looks at letters on your resume. The A level of certs will only get you entry/mid grade. You need to have multiple P level, or expert level if you really want to move up.  So, be better. Get more certs. A shit ton more. Start applying around. Talk to recruiters. For crying out loud, stop settling for ""decent"". Shoot for the stars. Settling for decent will mean you will get taken advantage of by an employer."

I believe that should change the management IP to vlan 25 since right now it looks like its sitting on vlan1 (by default).  The other option is OP could assign an IP to vlan 25 from the interface level, but that's not really what I assume he's going for here"
networking,3b4pap,Flightless_Ferret,3,Fri Jun 26 03:08:26 2015 UTC,Can you explain on what the difference is?
networking,3b4pap,Working_Hard_ly,2,Fri Jun 26 03:36:05 2015 UTC,"Sure thing, I'm the above guy's alt account.  Anyway, let me jump into it.  I think I know what's going on here? Idk, I could just be rambling - take with salt.  In your posted config, you have:  exit ip address 192.168.100.4 255.255.255.0 ip default-gateway 192.168.100.3   This is giving the switch a ""management"" IP, it's just an IP address for you to use for remote management (telnet, http, ssh).  Since dell's come out of the box configured for vlan 1, this IP is associated with vlan 1.  You have created vlan 25, but not assigned an IP to it, in this line:  interface vlan 25 name ""WiFi""   So, think of it this way.  You have a router in between 2 networks.  On one side is LAN 1 on the other is LAN 25.  On said router, the interface plugged into LAN 1, you gave an IP, aka a default gateway.  However, on LAN 25, there is no IP and no default gateway.  You plugged your PC into LAN 25's network and you're trying to ping the IP on LAN 1.  See why that wouldn't work? You need to give an IP to LAN 25 or said another way - LAN 25 needs a default gateway.  Back to your actual issue, you can solve this one of two ways.  Change your switch's management IP to VLAN 25 OR assign an IP directly to VLAN 25.  (Helpful hint, you can't assign an IP who's subnet overlaps with the management IP's to another vlan)  So you have two config options here (well atleast I suppose):  member 1 5 exit ip address 192.168.100.4 255.255.255.0 ip default-gateway 192.168.100.3 ip address vlan 25    #This is the added line, set's your mgmt IP to vlan 25 ip routing ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.100.2 interface vlan 25 name ""WiFi""   The above we assigned your mgmt IP to the proper vlan, 25.  Below we'll change your mgmt IP to something outside vlan 25's target subnet, just to get it out of the way.  Then we'll assign an IP to VLAN 25.  member 1 5 exit ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0    #changed mgmt Ip ip default-gateway 10.10.10.1    #changed dg as well. ip routing ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.100.2 interface vlan 25 ip address 192.168.100.4 255.255.255.0  #added this line name ""WiFi""   If I were to do this, I'd suggest doing it the first way.  Truth be told, that config is actually a bit much since it looks like you're trying to route on your cisco, you don't actually need:  ip routing ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.100.2   But that shouldn't hurt anything...Anyway, hopefully this helps? Truth be told, I don't think about this often since I don't use my 6248's for anything more then just layer 2, my config's are pretty bare bones, so lab it up and let me know how it goes!"

networking,3b4pap,theamazingretardo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:13:58 2015 UTC,"A bit, but I think you still need to follow /u/MhughesNP advice:  You have fa0/3 configured as a trunk, but you haven't allowed any vlan's on it.  So, not to write your config's for you, but on the cisco:  interface FastEthernet3 switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed VLAN 25   That should pass a vlan 25 tag to the dell.  On the dell, 1/g45-1/g48 should work just fine.  If not, I recommend narrowing down your config's.  Right now it's hard to tell if you've got a trunking issue, a vlan issue or an IP addressing issue.  So here's the process I'd recommend.  Take some non trunk ports and assign them to be simple access ports in vlan 25.  Take a computer, give it an IP inside the 192.168.100.0-192.168.100.254 range and try to ping that switch's IP.  Does that work? If so, then do the same on the other switch.  Does that work? If so, then try plugging both those access ports (one from each switch) into each other.  Can each switch ping the other? If so, then finish up by double checking your trunk.  This way, if something fails in that line, then you'll know what the issue is."

You don't need to state which vlans are allowed on the trunk (all vlans are allowed by default) but you do need to set the trunking protocol which should be dot1q to match what the Dell uses. The router may be using ISL which is Cisco proprietary trunking protocol.   It is either one of those things or the Dell is not using VLAN 25 for its management traffic.  Also to troubleshoot you should use these commands,  Show interface fa0/3 Show VLAN 25 Show  interface trunk Show spanning-tree VLAN 25 Show interface status"

Unless you can assign multiple VLANs for management traffic"
networking,3b4pap,Flightless_Ferret,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:33:19 2015 UTC,You have the configured IP in the Cisco router on VLAN 25. If the Dell is also not using VLAN 25 then they will not be able to ping each other.   You can create as many management IP addresses that you want. I almost always have a SVI in each VLAN just for the ability to easily troubleshoot connectivity on a per hop basis.   For this experiment you are just trying to test trunking between two different vendor devices. Pinging between the management plane of the devices is the easiest way to test that.
networking,3b4pap,MhughesNP,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:16:12 2015 UTC,What is the standard practice for IP addressing then - always keep the management IP on VLAN 1?
networking,3b4pap,chuckbales,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:22:48 2015 UTC,No.  The standard practice is to not use VLAN 1 at all and to shut down SVI on VLAN1 if it was created. VLAN 1 is the default VLAN and is also the default native VLAN on the trunks. You don't use it for numerous security reasons.   It doesn't matter what VLAN you use as long as it is not 1. You just want to have a dedicated VLAN for management traffic (with separate physical ports preferably) so there is a lower chance that a problem in the data plane will prevent access to your management interfaces though that is not a guarantee since  a bridging loop can consume all the switch resources and all the switch ports will be screwed.   Besides having a VTY port for management you almost always have an Access Server connected to the dedicated console port as well. The console is you out of band (OOB) management port.

You need to change the config on the Cisco switchport going to the Dell to be this,  Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q Switchport mode trunk  Switchport trunk allowed VLAN 25   You also need to check that your IP address on the Dell is equivalent to the Cisco SVI that you have configured. If the Dell setup is different you might not be sending packets on VLAN 25.   When a Cisco receives tagged frames on a access port it will drop the frame."

Its a fairly well constructed device and will probably move packets for years between reboots.    But what it the network starts to misbehave?    What if it feels like packets are NOT being delivered as desired?    That dumb netgear device has no diagnostic capability or port-spans, or syslogs, or error counters or any data at all to contribute to finding the diagnosis.    You can swap it out and see if things feel better.  But thats arguably a somewhat expensive option or experiment.    What if some of your traffic is more important that other traffic?  That dumb Netgear has no ability to treat traffic with different priorities.    The packets go in, the packets go out.  He is a dumb switch - thats what he does.    Buying a more advanced switch offers you the ability to access features & capabilities that you perhaps don't need TODAY.  But in my experience, once you desicde you need them, you tend to need them very badly and in a serious hurry.    This doesnt mean you should deploy very high end equipment in all scenarios.  But you should identify a baseline of features that you feel really should exist in whatever product you adopt as standard.      Syslog both internal and external.  Per-port interface counters (packets sent & errors).  Port-mirroring or port-spanning.  A proper understanding of VLANs, even if the quantity of VLANs is limited.

My campus LAN's are all much happier and more efficient with edge-to-edge QoS everywhere.    But, a 30 user office with a local file server only, VoIP phones and a WAN router (or redundant WAN routers) would probably not experience any LAN congestion of sufficient frequency or duration to make LAn QoS mandatory.    This assumes a 48-port non-oversubscribed Gigabit LAN device were in place.    If the users in question pounded on that file server, and did experience periodic local congestion, primative QoS (CoS) in the form of having the phones mark their packets, and telling the primative LAN device to honor the markings would probably be sufficient.    That could all very probably be performed with one of those semi-smart Web-UI only LAN devices.    WAN QoS, obviously would be very much required to protect VoIP from abuse from other traffic.    Because we have adopted edge-to-edge QoS, our Catalyst LAN devices detect, classify and mark packets on ingress.  Then they queue them per priority, and during periods of LAN congestion (however infrequent that may happen) the drop packets in accordance with their priorities.    The QoS markings (DSCP values) are trusted by the upstream LAN gear, and trusted again by the WAN routers.    This releives the WAN rotuers from needing to discover and classify packets by ACL again, they just classify and forward based on the existing DSCP values.    All textbook stuff really, nothing ground breaking at all.    My point is that Enterprise, granular QoS in a simple LAN environment is not of such high a value in many small to medium environments that I would declare it a mandatory feature for a small business environment.    Sending errors & events to an external syslog server on the other hand, is without question so valuable to the troubleshooting process that I would not support a request to buy a device that did not support that capability.    I love QoS.  I want granular QoS in all my equipment.  But I think I could make many LAN environments work without it, or with primative QoS.

There was heavier discussion on the CompSci side about Dijkstra's algorithm, but only a small bit about it being a part of routing protocols.

From the standpoint of how an EE is applicable to NE world I can tell you that I was Control's Engineer for 12yrs before I moved my career to NE. I feel that it is applicable because NE/EE needs to be analytical, and good at troubleshooting. Doing the coding in say Cisco is easy i.e it's not hard for someone to standup BGP in the most basic sense, but to troubleshoot it you need to have someone who knows how to efficiently and effectively look at the situation and answer the who-what-where-when of the problem in order to work on a resolution. An EE does this already with systems. Say you have a switch that burned up out in the field; if you are an EE fixing that switch you are going to grab schematic, start the primary of the transformer, across the secondary, on to the rectifier, and so on until you isolate the issue and repair it.

networking,3b2hxb,thedude42,3,Fri Jun 26 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"With respect to the degree differences... I went to a school where the only classes taught in assembly and C were in the EE/ECE department, and the CS department literally had no classes using C, and assembly was minimally taught using risc  and simulator languages.  When I took the CS elective ""advanced networking"" there were mostly EE/ECE folks taking it, not CS students."
networking,3b2hxb,wolfmann,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:31:30 2015 UTC,weird CS department... mine was a top20; we had to take compilers which forces you to know top level languages and convert them to Assembly; also had some Assembly in the Computer Architecture class as well.
networking,3b2hxb,thedude42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"Oh we did assembly, just not x86.  In the upper division architecture class it was MIPS, but not a lot.  Compilers was an elective I didn't take and honestly the prerequisites for the class weren't adequate, leading to many students being under served by the course.  In the Programming Languages class we did write a parser generator and semantic analyzer for a subset of C, but things like pointers and IO were far outside the scope of the course.  What I noticed is that algorithm and language technology was seen as the domain of CS, and interconnection and circuits were the domain of EE/ECE, and almost no one attempted to focus on the specific mixing of algorithms and circuit design.  My thought is that this is going to be changing in the future with the advent of very cheap ASIC components with high speed interconnects, and it will be practical to show these things to undergrads."

networking,3b2hxb,mathech,3,Thu Jun 25 17:02:13 2015 UTC,"EE here working in netsec. If you choose a digital EE specialization like Embedded Systems, you learn the basics of communications protocols, how to build your own serial/parallel protocols through firmware programming, etc. Having to create collision-free protocols and implementing your own IO buffers helps a lot. It's easy to abstract that knowledge to TCP/IP.  In the same way, being able to design a microprocessor-based system from the transistor level gets you used to the concept of data flow within a single device, which isn't that different from data flow within a network. It's still understanding what talks to what and where your delays are. And honestly most of that understanding is done by drawing out your block diagrams and your connections. You can do the same with a network; draw a block diagram and trace the routes to understand where your data is flowing. Whether the ""blocks"" are processors and registers or routers and switches doesn't really matter. It's the same type of system.  Assembly programming and debug is all about manipulating binary/hex data. Also easily abstracted to networking.  All I really had to learn was TCP/IP basics and routing/switching basics. A few labs to learn how to work in the CLI and you're off to the races, but that's easy if you can work from the Terminal in Linux/Unix."

The number of people I meet in this field who seem to be unable to read the documentation is staggering.    2) I find I can work in binary far better than others.

If you're involved in engineering DWDM networks it really helps to understand the physics of optics as well as understanding modulation schemes.    To me there's a difference in pasting a configuration on a box and getting it to work and having a deep understanding of the system so when you design a new network or troubleshoot problems you can actually understand the details.

On the design, pre-sales, sales and customer facing technical sides, you are more likely to come across with people with degrees.

Back in the mists of time when the internet was still becoming a Thing, I was looking at college (never ended up going).

My options were:   1: Mechanical Engineering BSc > Aerospace Engineering Masters (or just hit Embry-Riddle and go straight Aerospace) 2: Electrical Engineering and pick up as many computer-related courses as I could.  CS/CE degrees were born out of EE degrees because if you were in computers you were probably making chips and doing circuit design, or you were dealing with running electricity over wires for some reason or another. The reason they still include it is because some schools were really slow on picking up CS/CE paths, and even moreso networking. (I remember 5 or 6 years ago looking at a community college coursebook and they only had one CS offering that was pure programming.)  At a guess, the H1B folks' schools haven't bothered to roll over to separate CS and EE degrees for whatever reason."

If you don't work with VoIP it could probably considered.  BPDU guard/filters are important  I like adding port-security setting it to something like 5 max macs and setting the port security to reset every 3 mins or something. It will shelter you from CAM overflows and is pretty hands-off if you set the time-out correctly.   That's all I can really some up with on the top of my head.

Test to see if VTP is version 2 and if you are running any switches in server or client mode and then modify your VLANs by plugging in a switch and setting it's VTP config revision number higher If the DTP is negotiating they can test to see if you are using a native VLAN on the switch that is forwarding traffic and attempt to do VLAN hopping or do double tagging.  They can also get traffic to flow though a connected switch by doing MAC spoofing in order to capture all traffic flowing through the switch."
networking,3b2kzh,MhughesNP,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:42:08 2015 UTC,Your first bullet point is what I'm most interested in. To see if it's possible to get an interface already hardcoded as mode access to negotiate to trunk.
networking,3b2kzh,Jank1,3,Thu Jun 25 15:46:04 2015 UTC,"While DTP stills runs, the switch should not allow the port to negotiate to a trunk port if the ""switchport mode access"" command is configured.   If the switch sees a tagged frame come in, it should dropped the frame. If I know it is a Cisco switch that I am connected to I would check every Ethernet port I can find to see if I can negotiate it to a trunk.  People make mistakes and infrastructure changes all the time - the network engineer might have forgotten to hard code a switchport and left it in dynamic desirable or dynamic auto which is the default mode depending on which Cisco platform it is.   The real point is that you should not give more information than you need to a possible attacker.  The reason that security people like to turn off CDP as well."
networking,3b2kzh,MhughesNP,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:57:38 2015 UTC,"I'm of the same belief, don't share more information than you have to. I guess nonegotiate would be good to enable as a best practice then even though it seems an attacker would be unable to change the mode to access if hardcoded. Thanks."
networking,3b2kzh,Jank1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:15:37 2015 UTC,You can't negotiate an access port to a trunk. No-negotiate only makes it so that the device on the other end will not function with the switch unless it is also defined as an access port.  If you connect a switchport mode access port with nonegotiate to an DTP dynamic desirable switchport the two devices will not talk.  If it is switchport mode access to a DTP dynamic desirable port the DTP port will negotiate to access.  this thread sort of explains it all.  https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/thread/47243

With the HT502 and HT503, I didn't see anything built into them for me to test if they could see each other.  I think that's what I was most frustrated about.   I didn't even know if they were talking... or seeing each other.   I did set up both the FXO and FXS ports to look to the other device.   I found a few peer-to-peer guides for these exact devices online, which I followed.  When that didn't work, I tinkered a lot.     Do you know if the devices need to talk to each other over WAN port or LAN port?   Each box has a LAN/WAN connection.   Since i was in a LAN configuration, I didn't know for sure.  Since I'm using devices that want SIP connection to a VoIP provider, or SIP server, I'm glad that I'm not using 80% of the settings in the hardware, but I'm confused as to what I actually need for such a ""simple"" configuration.  When I used just the one HT503 to have the POTS connected directly and a phone to it, dialing *00 allowed me to dial out.   When dialing in, the phone didn't ring.    I must really not know what I'm doing.   It seems so logical, but with so many different radio buttons and ""YES"" or ""NO"", I'm missing something.      I'm a large enterprise network and systems admin.  You'd think I could figure out a simple little phone box!  haha  When/If I get this connected, is there a way to make the phones simply dial-tone right to the outside, without having to press *00 (or whatever I change that to) every time?   Or, will the phones need to dial 9 to tell the HT device ""I want to dial over POTS""?"

networking,3b35u6,Tarnel,2,Thu Jun 25 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"Any activity on your pc DOES affect the transfer if you're using windows explorer.  This is something I have to do regularly for a large variety of reasons, and when doing so the transfer is ALWAYS faster between two mapped drives and windows explorer if you use the most powerful machine you can get your hands on and have it doing absolutely nothing else.  This is partially to do with the time calculations and partially to do with windows double-checking each file and comparing it to the original after it's transferred. Any other overhead in the operating system slows that process down.  Not a big deal if you're transferring a single 250gb file. (only one file to check)  HUGE deal if you're transferring 250gb of small files.  (thousands or tens of thousands of files to check)  With small files, due to the sheer number of checks the OS performs when you use Explorer to handle the copy, It can take anywhere from 10 to 100 times longer if the CPU/RAM are under heavy use from something else."
networking,3b35u6,Kiernian,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:53:50 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply.  I'm asking more about the pathway the files takes and if me initiating a file transfer between two other devices on my third device has any effect on it.  I was asking because I have a couple of computers on a subnet that are getting slow transfer rates between our management subnet and theirs and also our file server subnet and theirs. Speeds are fine between PC's on the same subnet.  I wanted to test the speeds between two devices on different subnets (theirs and a file server) but didn't want to physically walk over there and didn't want to remote into their PC and even trying to avoid logging into the server. All for various reasons.  I didn't know if tranferring  the files using my PC as the instigator would be a true test or not.
networking,3b35u6,wulfsburg,2,Thu Jun 25 18:04:53 2015 UTC,It is not a true test of bandwidth. What you want is a traffic generator. Look into iperf or some other kind of software that you would run between 2 notes. That is a much more accurate way to gauge if its the network or between the 2 points or not.   Read more about it in general here:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iperf  But get something that is designed to test throughput... a file transfer doesn't cut it.
networking,3b35u6,Casper042,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"If you want iPerf for Windows, look for a tool called NTTTCP from Microsoft which is 'NT Test TCP' abbreviated.  And I wholeheartedly agree with /u/wulfsburg that for network testing, File Copy is a horrible benchmark.  Use iPerf/NetPerf on Linux and NTTTCP on Windows to stress the network.  On my 10 Gb enabled Blade Servers, I can easily push over 9 Gbps (9.4 is about the max you will ever see in the real world) between 2 servers, even though the HDDs in those servers can't handle that speed."

networking,3b35u6,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:26:29 2015 UTC,"File eXchange Protocol:       File eXchange Protocol (FXP) and (FXSP) is a method of data transfer which uses FTP to transfer data from one remote server to another (inter-server) without routing this data through the client's connection. Conventional FTP involves a single server and a single client; all data transmission is done between these two. In the FXP session, a client maintains a standard FTP connection to two servers, and can direct either server to connect to the other to initiate a data transfer. The advantage of using FXP over FTP is evident when a high-bandwidth server demands resources from another high-bandwidth server, but only a low-bandwidth client, such as a network administrator working away from location, has the authority to access the resources on both servers.

networking,3b35u6,Casper042,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:27:39 2015 UTC,"Short version, if you are using Windows and you use a Desktop to move files from ServerA to ServerB, your desktop is pulling the files to itself and then pushing the files to ServerB.  Proof: If you are in Windows XP/Vista/7 you can see this very easily by Opening Task Manager, go to the Networking Tab, click ""View"" up top, then ""Network Adapter History"". Turn Sent and Received ON but I usually turn Total OFF.  Now you can see in the graph for Local Area Connection the Bits In vs Out.  Do your file copy and you should see both a Red and Yellow line and they approximately match.  How do you fix it? If the host on the other subnet is also running Windows, you might be able to get on it 2 main ways. 1- Use Remote Desktop Client (Start, run mstsc.exe) and connect to the host.  Then initiate the file transfer from there. 2- Get the PSTOOLS pack from Microsoft (former SysInternals) and extract it on your desktop.  From a Command prompt, type PSEXEC \\SERVER CMD.EXE Where SERVER is the host on the other subnet. That will open a CMD prompt on the remote machine but be visible on your side.  Use 'hostname' to verify where you are and then do a simple COPY or ROBOCOPY command since you are in a Command Prompt.  You won't see the speed but you could measure the transfer time and get a rough idea."

In a previous job we had an older model Optiview - I can't remember what it was called but it was effectively a first-gen Optiview's analysis board but without the touchscreen PC on the front. It was designed to just be plugged into the network somewhere interesting and then accessed remotely.   It was a very powerful piece of kit in that they'd thrown every kind of network analysis feature they could think of at it. At the same time, though, it wasn't hugely reliable as it often needed to be reset before it would tell you anything which made it less useful for emergent problems. I imagine this is something that they've subsequently fixed. Plus the cost for even that low-end model was very hard to justify.   Frankly, if I had 30K spare in my budget as much as I'd want to blow it on an Optiview I could probably find more productive uses for the money. We just don't have that much of a need for that kind of tool.   On the other hand, though, if your job is such that you often have to visit sites you know little or nothing about and fix complex problems then the fast network discovery features and everything-you-need-in-one-boxness of the Optiview is pretty much impossible to find elsewhere."

This is one reason many NTP servers broadcast the wrong time for up to a day after a leap second insertion, and it has been suggested that hackers have exploited this vulnerability.""

You can run a CWDM mux at the head end and a single channel drop for each warehouse and connect them all at 1Gbps today and 10Gbps in the future (assuming you choose the channels around 1550nm).  Then from the point of view of your ethernet switch each warehouse has its own connection and you can get full bandwidth to each.  Better still, do the drop using an in-pit mux. Then if you have some sort of environmental condition in a warehouse (fire, whatever) then the other  warehouses will still be online, giving you better business continuity.  These muxes are unpowered, so a power fault in one warehouse has no downstream consequences, unlike chaining Ethernet switches."
networking,3b2jh9,DexTsarII,2,Thu Jun 25 22:39:41 2015 UTC,"Hi I have about 7-8 years experience on this stuff. I'd recommend buying and using a Cisco router (the 4000 series routers are being promoted heavily at the moment, but the 1921 is a good router too and suits 90% of SMB's).   For your policy control. Usually, people have their own WAN facing router with an ACL on the outside interface blocking loads of traffic inbound. They then put the more specific control policies on their firewall.   The firewall usually adds extra protection due to UTM, IPS, and deep packet inspection capabilities (which basically can protect you up to layer 7 on the OSI model), as well as offering some web filtering (usually tied in with a UTM policy).   The switch is usually considered in a safe zone away from external threats, so focuses on policies like port-security, ARP & DHCP spoofing etc. These kinds of features are there to protect against disgruntled employees trying to break your own internal network, or against someone who has compromised your network via the wireless (i.e. all stuff are threats within your ""internal safe zone"" if you like).  So put simply, you will end up securing all these devices, but they just have different security functions for your network.  FYI I'd seriously highly recommend against ever using a 3rd party to look after and manage a router. I have seen BT doing this for some businesses, and they provided a router and kept pushing firmware updates to it causing it to reboot. The helpdesk were too dumb to understand my findings so I replaced their router with a Cisco product, and stopped this problem."
networking,3b2jh9,CBRjack,3,Thu Jun 25 14:58:53 2015 UTC,This works for most people but does he really need a router? Sonicwall should accomplish all basic routing/nat needs along with s2s vpn. It will also do all firewall stuff. If OP is not looking for advanced routing features or QoS on the WAN link than assuming this is not a huge company I think he will be fine without an edge router.
networking,3b2jh9,DexTsarII,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:07:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, yes in some situations you can cope without a router and just use the firewall. Usually the determining factor is the type of hand off from the ISP. So assuming you are buying a DSL line, you probably need an ATM or VDSL interface, which most firewalls tend not to have.  If you are planning on letting the ISP manage the router (i.e. let them buy the router with an ADSL or VDSL interface), and you just use the firewall as your CPE, then you can do that instead. It will be down to budget. If there is enough budget then buy the router.  I personally am very anal about owning as much of the equipment as possible because I can troubleshoot faults a lot more quickly and better. So if you were having slow internet speeds, or problems with the internet cutting out, then you don't have the facility to check the router's logs and perform some troubleshooting. You have to call a guy up and get him to look at it. And this is why that 90% of the time, serviced offices (offices with an ISP managed router) take a lot longer to fix faults that are business impacting. You usually have to log a ticket, wait for an idiot engineer to check it, fail, then get slightly smarter person to look at it etc etc until it's fixed.   One thing I would advise if you are going to just let the ISP manage the router is to make sure you get a public subnet on your LAN side of the router (i.e. you get a public IP on your firewall's WAN interface). Just ask the ISP for a /29 or something. The reason why is, if you need to do some static NAT rules, then you have complete control on how your NAT is configured (and not have to log a call to change it). Another reason, is because if you need a site-to-site VPN or client VPN configured, then having the public IP on your firewall makes the config a lot simpler (it can still be done with a private IP, but it's just more of a ball-ache)."

networking,3b33ol,X-Istence,2,Thu Jun 25 16:42:20 2015 UTC,"Iperf has to be the worst tool for measuring network goodput. It applies its own TCP buffer size, totally undoing all the buffer autosizing of the operating system. It does reporting in the same thread as the traffic, so if the reporting I/O has latency then you get jitter in the observed traffic (and if the Gbps is high enough then all reporting has latency).  Just run up a webserver which uses sendfile(), Apache will do fine. Create a 'holey file' so there is no real disk I/O. Use wget to grab that file and write it to /dev/null. You've now got a TCP connection which accurately reflects the best an application can do. You can then pursue whatever issues that uncovers, starting with Wireshark.  If you have a Internet performance issue related to TCP dynamics then Google have fielded a stack of Web100 servers with their mlab project.

Make sure you follow it with, I have a strong learning curve and can figure out anything. The key to being great at really any job is being able to troubleshoot the situations you get into. Use the tools you have to find a solution.  Also, make sure you have good positive energy when interviewing and talking with people. Take deep breaths and practice what you might say and read your resume so you know what is on it. And don't for any reason put things on your resume that you don't know.  I conducted two 2 hour interviews today and one of them was full of fluff. I lit that guy up because he essentially was lying, and when we realized it he was toast."

This is because when you give your PC a 255.255.0.0 netmask but the camera is still set to 255.255.255.0, the camera does not see the PC as part of its local subnet.  Is it possible to just factory default the camera and reset its IP?  Unless you change everything to a /16 (255.255.0.0) mask, or add another routed interface on the 192.168.254.X/24 network, it won't be able to communicate with anything else."

On a CLI-based OS (linux, IOS-esque) I would add a secondary IP on the LAN network interface for every subnet you want to scan.  Having 256 IPs on one interface shouldn't be a big deal, but you want to be careful not to steal someone's IP.  After you have the IPs you can do your nmap scan on the /16 and hopefully find them."

Regarding undercutting the official pfSense store price -- I'd suggest you reconsider.  The official store is hardware that is fully tested for the latest builds of pfSense, and is continually supported by future build testing, and also comes with support from Netgate, the company that employs the pfSense core dev team (when you get support responses, you're talking to the actual developers).  For a situation like a business, school, etc, having that quality and support is really important (I know from firsthand experience) - -it's totally worth the extra couple of hundred dollars, honestly -- both in terms of your sanity and in terms of the cost/risk to the organization from troubleshooting hardware compatibility, software bugs, config issues, etc.  Also, the official store hardware ships with custom-tweaked images of pfSense that are optimized for the hardware; you can tweak a regular public build to do the same thing, but again -- weigh the cost and risk of time, mistakes, support, etc.  Also note that the 8860 is one of the top-end machines from pfSense -- it has the same general core components as their C2758 machine, which is designed to support 10gbps routed connections.  For a school of your size, I'd be very surprised if you had the need or resources to get/use even a 1gbps line.  If you're not comfortable with the price point of the 8860, downgrading to the 4860 or even the 2440 would be perfectly fine (both of those models support 1gbps throughput, I believe).  Also, for pfSense chat, you will get many more informed responses, including (usually) responses from one or more of the pfSense developers on /r/pfsense.  Feel free to message me if you want to chat more -- I've built my own pfSense servers and bought a few different models of the official ones, so I can speak to both sides (not affiliated with them, just a happy customer).

Also, the 3560 (24-port) is 6.6Mpps/8.8Gbps; roughly double that if it's a 48-port. See this link:  http://www.cisco.com/web/partners/downloads/765/tools/quickreference/switchperformance.pdf"

It's like the printer isn't responding to the ARP request and maybe the one ADMIN PC which still had the nic from the old network somehow kept it in a cache?

That said, given the fact that no other machines are even resolving ARP for that IP, it's unlikely that there is a duplicate IP because surely at least one of them would respond.  Can you create a static ARP entry on one of the machines that can't ping it and test if it works that way?  Are you working with managed switches? Maybe there is something strange in the config of a switch causing the issue?"

With this your troubleshooting will be top notch and you'll go far  edit: Just to be a bit more clear here. If you're ever learning the behaviour of a new protocol, assume nothing. Configure it in a lab, capture packets to see what's happening. Break things and think about how you would expect it to behave, then see what really happens. This has been my philosophy form the start and I've done well with it.

networking,3ayo1g,the-packet-thrower,9,Wed Jun 24 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"No one remembers the minutia. I look for the following mastery from a solid network administrator:   OSI understanding Basic binary and hexadecimal math skills Working knowledge of ${dynamic_routing_protocol} functionality, configuration and troubleshooting Ability to design redundancy at switching and routing layers Capable of writing simple automation scripts Proficiency with a relevant operating system and troubleshooting abilities with at least one used application   Breaking that down further, I need someone with the base knowledge to formulate the right questions to ask team members, management, vendors and Google, when that person reaches the end of what they can recall from memory. Scripting and application delivery experience is no longer a want; I find it necessary for executional effectiveness.  For your bonus question, if I were to start as a network engineer at a new employer, I would perform the following:   Crawl Ethernet, logical and resolved addresses, comparing against documentation (LLDP, MAC entries, nmap, dig) Make sure I can log into every device and compile a list of exceptions Ensure all network gear configuration resides within a repository which I could pull and grep against Identify and categorize all used protocols: STP, OSPF, BGP, VRRP, etc Make a topology map and circle areas lacking redundancy Review ticketing system for the prior six months' failures and develop an automation or self-heal plan to address top issues Present findings to network and systems groups, requesting feedback within a set window Submit a plan to management, requesting a nod and ask that the document serve as the basis for your performance review ??? profit?   When you start a job, think of ways you can directly influence change. The biggest wins, in my humble opinion, come from taking the initiative to tackle nagging or highly-visible problems and adhering to a plan with management buy-in.

Like  /u/totallygeek said, identify critical areas of the network that need redundancy and explain to management the consequences of ignoring the single points of failure. Create diagrams of current configuration and future proposed plan.

If you're lucky enough to work somewhere where their existing diagrams are up to scratch, then print these out and log onto the devices and follow it through.  For security devices that don't diagram well - review firewall policies, review proxies, review load balancers.  Read company policies - what are their acceptable use policies, do the devices adequately enforce these.  Review review review.  A lot of companies (most / all) do not get the most out of their tools.  I have worked for many places who have a diverse set of tools, none of which are utilised to their full extent.  One place had HP Openview, PRTG and Solarwinds Orion, for example.  Each of which they were paying yearly maintenance on, and none of which were operating correctly.

VLANs are a no-brainer. If people are leaving them off their diagrams, it should be because it's not interesting, or they're routing at their edge.

networking,3b1d02,arkaddicts,2,Thu Jun 25 04:27:55 2015 UTC,"For the past ~9 years or so we've had an old Foundry BigIron RX-16 chassis as a core switch, with 120x MRJ-21 cables coming out the front going to various 24 and 48 port patch panels in a small datacenter.  They're fairly stiff cables (Tyco brand in our case), and without a doubt the biggest complaint we have is the fragility of the cable ends. In particular the screws/bolts tend to get stuck in whatever standoff you're screwing them in to. This has happened in both the line cards for the switch and the tyco patch panels. Guessing they just swell a little over time, but it's a PITA to disassemble and try to fix them if/when they move. Worst case is when the heads of the screws break off.  That said, the panels and cables that haven't been moved much have all been fine and while a bit old at this point certainly are nicer than 6x the number of ethernet cables.  Are these going to be dropped from a ceiling/trays? Bend radius is a possible concern -- at least the Tyco cables I'm familiar with are very stiff so that might be a concern."

That's me applying the most pressure I personally feel comfortable with to the end. That's right at 3"" from end of connector to cable going down at 90 degrees. This also happens to be the exact same bend as the worse ones coming out of our Foundry switch (the cables have been fine in an HPC cluster that operates close to full 1Gbps utilization for years, so I can safely say 'no issues' with it).  That first 1"" of black from the grey connector head is very stiff, after that it's a bit more flexible for the record. The middle of the cable itself is a bit more flexible -- I would say a bend radius of ~1.5"" isn't too insane. I don't personally have any bent that much though in production. Also I have no idea what the specs call for -- that could be asking for trouble.  Another thing to note, this is all for the older standard MRJ-21 --- Just realized Tyco has a mini/thin MRJ-21 out now which could be a much better fit for you.  As for supplier, the only times I've bought them have been through Anixter (www.anixter.com) along with Tyco patch panels. Never had issues, but also never shopped around for a 'best' price."

networking,3b0az7,creddfltswap,2,Wed Jun 24 23:01:56 2015 UTC,"I think that what you are having problems with is you want to connect to your ASA using AnyConnect and be able to connect directly to your management interfaces of your other production devices which are located on a subnet that is connected to your ASA's management interface.  If this is slightly different than your issue it doesn't really matter, since the issue comes down to being able to override the outgoing interface choice the ASA is making.  You only have two good choices here.   The first is to use policy based routing to direct the traffic to that subnet. The second is to create a static route on the ASA for every IP address that you want to reach from the outside. The static host route will override the NAT configuration.  route management 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.255 next_hop_IP 1 route management 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.255 next_hop_IP 1 route management 192.168.1.8 255.255.255.255 next_hop_IP 1 etc..   In some ways this is simpler than the PBR and it allows easy fine tuning of which devices you want to be able to reach externally.  Some production devices (like the ASA itself) you do not want to be able to be accessed externally even if the admin is connecting via AnyConnect."

Your baseline should be almost totally protocol based.    All HTTP goes here. All FTP and CIFS and NFS goes here. All VoIP goes here. And so on, and so forth.    You should avoid HTTP to & from <ip address> until you have no alternative.    Keep in mind, you will feel the greatest benefit from reducing the priority (drop threshold) of low-priority traffic as opposed to making everything higher and higher priority.    Make NetBackup beg for bandwidth. Make NetApp SnapMirror and Oracle DB Sync grovel and cry for capacity.    Evaluate whatever is filling your WAN circuits and seriously consider dropping it down in priority.    Most things that are truly high priority are small, and transactional in behavior.  Getting big lumbering CIFS traffic out of the way (into a lower queue & drop-threshold) will enable those smaller flows to have a far more pleasant experience."

networking,3aunte,JohnnyKilo,7,Wed Jun 24 16:26:33 2015 UTC,Not to be overlooked is proper STP configuration on your core. We didn't have STP priorities on any VLANs set and 2 old ass 3550s took over as the root bridges (based on low MAC address I believe) for about 50 of our 150 VLANs without anyone's knowledge. The CPU spiked on the 3550s and I noticed the trunk ports were allowing all VLANs. There were only 2 or 3 switchports in use as access ports so I pruned all of the over VLANs from the trunks and caused a huge outage. Still not sure why but STP never recalculated. We essentially had STP root bridge on a stick with single non LAG gig interfaces. When I allowed the VLANs again everything worked again. I was able to set the priority so the core switches took over. I still have a few VLANs to move.  This was a pain.
networking,3aunte,oonniioonn,8,Tue Jun 23 22:53:33 2015 UTC,based on low MAC address I believe   Yeah who the fuck ever thought that was a good idea? They're random now but the OIDs used to be handed out sequentially so doing that always lands you at the oldest equipment being the root bridge.
networking,3aunte,BrainAIDS,9,Wed Jun 24 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"It makes sense when you think about it. I'm guessing the original point was to maintain some form of stability when adding new switches. Newer switches from the same vendor would arguably have a higher MAC address, preventing recalculation. If you had it the other way round then you could guarantee the network goes down every time you add something new. I guess people that disable STP wouldn't care where the root bridge was as long as the network is 'working'.  I know of a large hospital where someone disabled STP because 'every time we'd connect a switch the network would go down'. shakes head"

networking,3aunte,AndyofBorg,17,Wed Jun 24 01:20:10 2015 UTC,"I work in a hospital. You have to realize that many of the systems they use were designed in the 80s. Many of them have been strung along like this for decades. Many of them still rely on undesirable things, like requiring the devices to be on the same VLAN.  Modernizing these systems is EXTREMELY tedious, because the technology is so specialized, often finicky, and most of all, people's lives are at stake. You can't fuck up. You have to design new systems that will inter-operate with both modern and legacy systems.You have doctors who have been doing this for 40 years and resist learning a new system. Top this off with the doctors paying the bills and the absolutely staggering amount of political capital they have as such."

That or fire me, and I was dead serious.   A lot of vendors have to be dragged into the current decade. They're greedy and dishonest. Most of their stuff WILL work in a modern environment. They just don't want to put out the little bit of money (relatively-speaking) to figure out what to certify as ""the right way"".   For years, we had every vendor demanding their own database server. Huge specs, specific version of MSSQL. Then they'd run a 1GB DB on it. We turned it around. Built a big SQL cluster, started telling them that their DB was going to share space on the cluster or they'd lose our business. It worked. We're not a big hospital as hospitals go.

The main reason we had to span various layer two networks across the various campuses was because of the poorly written apps they used.  One of the biggest was an RFID system that tracked beds, wheelchairs and other devices across the hospital.  If bed X was missing you would look it up and see which RFID sensor it tripped last.  That would give you a geographic area to look for it.  The stupid system only worked on a layer two domain.  What ended up happening was that previous contractors spanned the layer two domain across the layer three boundaries.. Giving is the worst of both worlds.    We eventually converted all hospitals to a a collapsed core hub and spoke configuration."

This was my main case study as to why you don't do that and why you configure STP properly and build hierarchical networks.  We actually bought a Hospital that had a flat L2 network, one cabinet had 10 or 11 access switches daisy-chained with 1foot patch leads and then a single uplink from the end switch to the core..... I mean not even the middle switch which would at least reduce the chances of orphaning huge numbers of access ports.  Oh an NO spanning tree :) Because it was run by sysadmins without a CCNA between them and STP ""just caused more problems"" when they turned it on.

The short answer is no, it doesn't create a network storm on its own. What it does is cause loops because spanning tree does not work properly due to a concept called network diameter.  Collapsed core is a LAN design where you have access switches connected to core switches and do away with the distribution layer. These are switches not routers, routers feature in the WAN not the LAN. If you have multiple buildings then you use a distribution layer to aggregate back to the site core. Cores then typically connect to routers and through them to the WAN. Normally distribution and core are multilayer switches that handle layer 3 as well as layer 2 forwarding."
networking,3aunte,projectdp,3,Wed Jun 24 07:16:28 2015 UTC,I see that I'm missing this shift in design from traditional core to collapsed core. The stacks vs rings with LAGs seems very nice. I should dive deeper into these core L3 enabled switches. Thanks for the detailed reply!

networking,3aunte,kunstlinger,3,Wed Jun 24 11:51:25 2015 UTC,"First- limiting broadcast traffic is a big deal.  By limiting your broadcast domains you limit your points of failure.   Second elimination of STP.  Links are typically point to point from access to distribution with only one VLAN being allowed across.  You can combine uplinks into an etherchannel for redudancy and enhanced throughput.  If a link fails even without etherchannel, layer 3 protocols reconverge faster than STP.    Third is management.  I can identify a device by what IDF/closet it is running from by its IP address.  I no longer have to ""show mac"" trace a device through 5-6 layers of switches.  I can simply go directly to the switch that is connected to.    Performance and reliability are increased while allowing for higher degrees of organizational expansion (scalability) at better performance."
networking,3aunte,kunstlinger,2,Wed Jun 24 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"I have a question which I already asked in a previous thread but I yet don't fully grasp the idea.  Take a look at this image OSPF - Layer 3 to the access layer design: If I understand correctly the links between each Area Border Router and BBone router are link to link Layer 3 connections. With every point to point link in it's own subnet (probably a /30).  But I was wondering if, for example, links going from AB-R1 & AB-R2 to BB-R1 go to a switch Like this image -switch now drawn- The green lines represent one subnet, and the red one a different subnet. Would this break the ""L3 down the access layer"" design? And if so, why's that?"
networking,3aunte,jpeek,3,Wed Jun 24 16:58:18 2015 UTC,"The first design you posted is not ""layer 3 to the edge"".  It is layer 3 to the distribution layer, which is a standard scenario.  Layer 3 to the edge would mean your access layer switches at the very edge of your network (those switches which service hosts directly) provide routing for its hosts and is the gateway for all of its users.  In the design you showed, you have each switchblock redundantly connected to a distribution layer switch, which then routes to the core(backbone).  Here, your access layer switches still feed to your distribution layer switches over layer 2 with no layer 3 connectivity in between.  If your distribution layer switches hold the SVIs or are performing the primary gateway role to hosts, then layer 3 is not at your edge.    Now assuming this design did route between access/distribution layer.  You'd see every switch connect to the next tier with /30 or /31 subnets (we use /31 being all cisco).  Changing the subnet size from /30 or /31 to a larger subnet for more hosts doesn't change the ""layer 3 to the edge"" aspect, it simply changes your OSPF neighborhood so to speak.  With the 2nd image you provided, you'd just have more neighbor adjacencies form, instead of simple point-to-point style stub networks."

I work with a smallish campus (24 buildings on a 20 acre campus, 14 of which are homes).  A few years ago, I migrated the organization to Ubiquiti Unifi, which was a dramatic improvement over the random collection of Asus and Linksys access points they were running previously.  The problem is that the buildings are close enough that the wireless coverage overlaps, so handheld devices and laptops and what not will happily roam from AP to AP.  If I were to break up my user VLANs into smaller layer 3 domains, that would break the roaming which I don't want to do.  My option is to either run a couple campus-wide VLANs for the wireless users, or switch the wireless system out for something more advanced, so that I can break things up a little more.  The good news is that I realistically only have 60 to 80 active users, and they're pretty good about not plugging in random crap.  I have also deployed all the tools I can to protect the L2 networks (DHCP snooping, BPDU guard, etc... ) so in all honesty, it has been rather stable.  That said, at least I do have the network broken up into a half-dozen VLANs, it's just that these VLANs span pretty much all the switches in town.  This is kinda depressing since a significant number of my switches are L3 capable."

networking,3aunte,millijuna,0,Tue Jun 23 20:16:05 2015 UTC,"Not really, it depends on user counts. Roaming isn't the issue. Turn down your TX power on your APs and let the clients find the WAP they want to connect to.  Roaming across L3 boundaries are the issue - clients will not request a new DHCP lease when roaming between WAPs on the same SSID. That said, with client isolation you should be able to put ~500 users on an L2 WIFI VLAN.  Is the best solution a controller based network? Of course. But if you're budget is sub-$100k instead of over-$100k... You can make it work."

networking,3aunte,Joeymon,3,Wed Jun 24 14:08:11 2015 UTC,One of the reason why L2 would be choosed instead of L3 down to the access layer would be:  A. Lower cost  B. Mobility as a VLANs can span different building/locations.  I'm sure there are other advantages as well.  Edit: typos

This sub tends to be fairly heavy with the ""don't try to do our job, call a professional"" which is not wholly wrong, but it's a bit black and white when the world is more shades of grey.  I think we need more information to make an assessment. It's unfortunate the guy won't help you. Unfortunately in some cases in the industry, people resent the baton pass and will do everything in their power to try to see the other guy fail.   As with all things, it tends to start with documentation. What can they give you? What can this guy give you? Get the company to lean on him to be more helpful. He shouldn't burn his bridges. After that, build your own documentation. Start with taking pictures of everything. Trace the cables. Start with the physical diagram which anyone can do. Then work out the logical diagram and go from there.  The ASA is a firewall and those tend to be one of the trickier parts of networking, so if anything that is probably where you'll either need help or a lot of work to get up to speed."

You should be honest with them and say their infrastructure is not something you commonly deal with - it is a learning curve for you, you are willing to put the time and effort in if they want you but they should know that you 'could' become 'stuck', and that they may want to look for someone with the applicable skills to do the job for them.  This way its not you quitting, its you being honest - which the company will appreciate, and giving them honest warning before major disaster falls on your shoulders - they made the business risk decision to keep you if thats the way it goes, and if you take 5 hours to resolve a 2 hour issue, that extra wait time is on them.  It's win win - you keep the work, you learn a lot (hopefully) and then have experience for the next big job of this scale, or you don't keep the work, you don't have to stress about things you dont understand or aren't confident in supporting, and you can continue doing the ample amount of work you suggest you have.

networking,3azre6,SuddenWeatherReport,3,Wed Jun 24 20:32:57 2015 UTC,You can select which speeds should be allowed for autoneg (for example autoneg but only announce 1Gbps as supported speed and only Full Duplex).

networking,3azre6,oonniioonn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"Different standards. Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet are different standards. The original Fast Ethernet standard had to be modified with annexes later to clear up some lingering questions related to speed, duplex and autonegotiation behavior. In the gigabit ethernet standard, autonegotiation is required because it is doing more than just simple speed and duplex."
networking,3azre6,Apachez,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:38:16 2015 UTC,When 10Mbps Ethernet was first designed there was no such thing as auto-negotiation. Even for 100Mbps it was something of an after-thought. By the time they got round to Gigabit it was realised that they should bake in auto-negotiation from the start.   Plus they knew that not all cables would support Gigabit operation. By enabling auto-neg it allowed the interfaces to step down to 100Mbps if the cable couldn't do Gigabit.
networking,3azre6,oonniioonn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:24:20 2015 UTC,"Auto-negotiation is required for gigabit ethernet over copper. Even if you fix the speed to 1000Mbps, it'll still be autonegotiating in the background; it'll just limit what it advertises to the link partner to just 1000mbps.   For ethernet and fast ethernet though, you can either fix them and disable autonegotiation or you can use autonegotiation and limit what is advertised. This is in my opinion the best option -- hard-coding the speed is fine (can be detected reliably) but if you hard-code the duplex you will at some point get a mismatch and that is not fun."
networking,3azre6,Apachez,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:26:50 2015 UTC,"I dunno, my best guess is due to compatibility reasons.  I still prefer to ""hardcode"" speed and duplex for 10 and 100Mbps links (when used RJ45) and auto/auto for 1Gbps links (or towards clients).  One common drawback of hardcoding speed/duplex is that you will miss the auto mdi/mdix feature which means you need to get a crossover cable if you want to connect lets say a router to a switch at 100/F fixed speed/duplex. While with autoneg (which have auto mdi/mdix enabled) the interface will figure out the polarisation on its own so the proper pins will become RX and TX.  Edit: You can of course do autoneg for 10 and 100Mbps devices. The reason one want ""hardcoded"" speed/duplex is because it sucks if your 100Mbit/Full Duplex link suddently becomes 10Mbit/Half Duplex because the interface incorrectly thought the other side is a 10/H device."

networking,3azre6,Apachez,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:28:27 2015 UTC,Yup but then I will curse IEEE :-)  Because setting fixed 1000/F for RJ45 isnt really supported on all devices and your result might vary - a workaround is to limit the autoneg to only support 1000/F as announced capability.  Also thats why I prefer fiber for 1Gbps (and above) links.

I'm happy to share if it is honest, but it sounds like it might just as easily be some condescending write-off of the possibilities the world offers.    Almost as if the sentiment behind it is ""He's doing risky adventurous things with his life, he must be irresponsible and a slacker who I'll have to support with my taxes"".  Which, I am not unfamiliar with, but given that you know nothing of my situation, values, or work ethic, it seems an uninformed and unfair position.  Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I could just as easily ask you: ""What are your plans for enjoying the present while living for a future that might not come?"""
networking,3atzce,Cheeze_It,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:28:07 2015 UTC,"I apologize. I'm sorry for asking the question as I did. It made me come off far differently than I was intending.  It's not at all a dismissal. I'm actually very jealous of you going out to the land of the Kiwis :) I very much so wish to have been able to go out there. I hear it's gorgeous.  It's not so much that you're taking risky adventures. It's more of, from everything I have seen....retiring is expensive. If one wants to retire with about 100K USD per year of interest then one has to save around 2.5 to 3 million and then manage it properly so as to make that much interest. Making that much money will take about 30 to 40 years of work and saving. That also entails getting a job that pays about 120K or more a year and saving most of it. One could (and should) invest in the market. That'll allow for more money to be created and could potentially decrease that time. The reason I say all that is because it's very likely that social security will be insolvent by the time current 25-30 year olds start to retire. They will have to generate most of their income from private retirement rather than government subsidized. That's why I asked...  I do not at all hold the view of for example, you being another slacker to support with my taxes. That's a worldview I do not at all share. I realize and understand that my taxes go to support people that are slackers, and that's kinda the price one must pay to have a system in place like there is in the US."
networking,3atzce,kshymkiw1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:17:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding. And for being as forthcoming with your concerns.  I'll let you know what changed in my mind, and how I've come to view things.  Compounded by the fact that our industrial society as we know it is dependent on many non-renewables, dependent on enforcement of particular legal codes, and dependent on a limitless amount of capital being created by the coffers at the Federal reserve (the power of which is dependent on much militarized control of oil markets, and the large-scale ignorance of the public) I've come to realize that even with a huge amount of money in reserve and saved away, I would still not feel that retirement is something I can realistically expect to be an option in my late years.  It's entirely possible that a financial collapse, a military attack, an overthrow of governments or power/energy producers, or destabilization of food/water sources could occur.  And some of those outcomes have a real chance at making our retirement savings disappear or become worthless.  Surely you feel some of the same doubt - your comment about an insolvent social security system shows that.  Does this lead me to be pessimistic and despair for my future?  It did.  For years. And I admit one of the reasons I went to NZ is because I learned about their embrace of renewables, and their overall eco-partnership approach to life.  (As an aside, I saw poor people in NZ, sure, but I never saw a hungry person.  I'd regularly pick my meals off of fruit trees and herbs, which seem to be abundant in every city and everywhere you can find them.  Something like 70% of families have vegetable gardens!)  Anyway, two ideas changed my thinking.  I'm going to share them.  I believe that instead of estimation of costs during retirement (adding up years of expenses for as long as you hope to live but not earn) is not the best way to get there.  The real winning strategy is to endeavor to make your living expenses as close to $0 as possible.  Some people my even be able to go into negatives.    This may include growing your own food (I recommend researching permacultural strategies for a no-work, self-fertilizing garden - particularly the book Gaia's Garden probably the only book you need.)  It may include creating your own power.  Fortunately, solar and Wind are becoming very cheap and attractive options, and beginning to gain acceptance in zoning boards.  (You don't need to try power your whole house... just the important appliances)  It may include cutting off services or working out deals to secure them for free.  Municipal free Wi-fi would be great, but so would building an antenna to capture it from a free service.  It may include building or upgrading your home to more resilient or efficient building materials.  It may involve a risk-reduction process and curtailing homeowners' insurance.  It may include reverse mortgaging your dwelling - either to a bank or to your children, should they accept.  It's a GREAT option to finance your lifestyle.  It may include riding or biking places instead of driving.    It may involve relocating to an area where the climate doesn't cost you much to maintain comfort, and things can grow.   It may involve taking on a roommate later in life to pat the costs.  I have a roommate who gives me $320 a month - that covers electrical & internet.  You'll notice that the above comprise a very self-reliant end-of-life approach, which may not be what you had in mind.  If your dream of retirement is to have everything be taken care of for you while you relax and watch TV or play games or whatever, well, it might be rather more expensive than my ideas would account for.  I do suggest the exercise however, of trying to add up your expected costs of retired life, and see what can be done to reduce them by lifestyle changes or technological improvements.  Or, if you're planning to consider any/all of the above like me, you may even rethink the whole notion of retirement and what it means.  This book may give you some perspective on alternatives.  Many people in life enjoy their work to the degree that they choose to continue working until they are no longer able.  Perhaps there's a trade or a talent you have that you could envision yourself actually enjoying performing in your late years?    Seriously, though, even if you've never considered yourself a gardener, read up on the methods of Permaculture.  It's the method of engineering the earth to work FOR you.  Imagine all the microbes in the soil, and the insects and birds and worms being your employees and doing all the work for you.  For free.  It's brilliant, and it might just be the very thing that can save humanity should every other industry collapse."

So the reason why I ask is because per....everything I've seen says that the likelyhood of social security being solvent as current 25-30 year olds retire is quite low at its' current rate. And saving 2.5 to 3 million isn't exactly easy.  I am not at all trying to be combative. When I wrote that out I was quite tired and I came off FAR FAR more dismissive than I ever intended to be. I am genuinely curious as it's something that one should/needs to keep in mind.

networking,3atzce,Ailbe,5,Wed Jun 24 05:21:35 2015 UTC,"First, I would try to figure out what you want to get out of your career, or what is the thing that originally drove you to become a network engineer. For me, it was the love of technology and building something from nothing. Learning and building, that's all I want to do. Figure that out, and focus on it, because that's what will drive any further decisions about what you do at your current company or what you will do at another one.  Problem is, you need to find a company that is disciplined enough to keep you where you want to be. It sounds like your current job doesn't make much of a distinction - either by nature of the loss of NOC positions or poor management - between operations and engineering. They've let things rot and now you're responsible for it all. I bet they also don't offer a lot of support for any decisions that would set them on a better path, there's probably no budget for tools or improvements to the network infrastructure, and we already know HR doesn't want to pay for any talent. There are probably a couple of idiot middle managers that think everything has to have an extremely detailed and ridiculous process to follow. Their heads are so far up their collective asses that they forget process and policy is supposed to help and not hinder. There's some kind of pressure from up top, so a couple of them are freaked out about losing their job, so every situation is an emergency so they can be sure that upper-management knows something is being done. Sounds all too familiar.   Either that company needs to suffer a dramatic shift in mentality, or you need to suffer a dramatic shift in employment and find somewhere else to work. Either way you look at it, you're the catalyst for that change. Take up your issues with management, see if they'll work through them. Be sure to speak their language - time, ROI, etc. You'll need to have plenty of documentation. I could be working on this, but instead I've been doing this and it affects the company in this way. That sort of thing.   It's up to you whether or not you want to take the fight to them, or abandon ship and let them sink and suffer. Honestly, there's no guarantee they'll ever ""get it."" Lots of companies are like that. Sometimes the pay and perks line up and make it worth dealing with their bullshit, at least until something better comes along.   If you do look for another job, make sure to ask a lot of questions during the interview. Take some examples from your current job and ask the new prospective employer how they'd handle that situation. Identify all the stuff that drives you nuts at your current job and ask them about that. Just don't frame it like ""my current job sucks and here's why, how would you do it differently."" Look up the place on GlassDoor to see what other people think of working there. You can also tell a lot about a company by what they're willing to invest in their employees. Cisco, for example, will hound you about improvement, training, where you want to be in 3-5 years, and how can they help you get there. They want you to be the best, they want you to move up, make more money, because ultimately it benefits them to have top-notch employees. Find out if the company has a training budget, if they send employees to conventions, support user groups, etc.   Just a couple of thoughts. Hope it helps, good luck."
networking,3atzce,ixholla,4,Tue Jun 23 21:39:49 2015 UTC,"Stop taking it so seriously. OP, you're super stressed.  I felt this way for a long time, took me losing my job (downsized) to realize how stressed I was.  The primary portion of stress from these types of jobs is that we take everything so seriously.  Someone says it has to be done now, well, we pressure ourselves to get it done.  People with passion, like you and I are particularly susceptible. funny thing is, we work more thoroughly, and make fewer mistakes when we're relaxed and able to be observant and creative, yet all management wants is ""better metrics"" - whatever that's supposed to mean.  Obviously, since everything is a 9-1-1, and needs to be done IMMEDIATELY, then nothing is a 9-1-1, and nothing needs to be done immediately.  Stop using their system of priority, start observing the tickets you deal with and ensure something is a priority before allowing yourself to feel pressured to get it done.  Keep working, by no means stop working, but don't pressure yourself to live up to their deadlines and expectations.  Create your own, and live the best way you can; for your own sanity do this.  An employer's expectations can only be so high, and as long as you're doing the job they're paying you for, there's very little room for anybody to complain.  Don't slack off, just don't push yourself so hard.  Calm focus, without the pressure, is going to serve you much better than what they're doing to you.  Both in the task at hand, and in the long term.  Nobody can function under constant high-stress, always 9-1-1 conditions and expect to stay sane.  You've done really well, keeping up with that pace for 4 years.  My suggestion: take a vacation.  You're probably like me, and nearly never take time off, so book a week or more off, and just sit back, relax and intentionally do nothing.  Watch the grass grow, go camping and stare at the campfire for a few hours.  Just relax.  When you come back to work, observe how the entire world crumbled while you were away (it didn't) - and realize that all that B.S. they feed you about you needing to get X done NOW, not now but RIGHT NOW, is exactly that, B.S.  The world will continue to revolve if the issue isn't resolved immediately, and take that perspective on everything moving forward.  Continue to work on things, but take it with a grain of salt, and don't let yourself get stressed out over stupid deadlines that THEY want you to believe are critical.  .... or find a new job.  Whichever works better for you."

networking,3atzce,vi0cs,2,Tue Jun 23 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"It's not hard really.  First find the following string of words in a job description:   Must have the ability to obtain a secret clearance This means the company will sponsor you getting your clearance.  Essentially, this means no criminal record, no foreign national ties, no offshore accounts, no DWI, no bankruptcy, just be an average John Q. Public.  You'll fill out your OPM Sf- 86 .   That gets submitted to OPM via the E Verify website and also to your FSO (Field Security Officer) who validates it and formally submits it.   Believe me when I say you do not want to know what it costs to get one. Just let them pay for it.  It will then go through adjudication where the FBI does a formal investigation on you and either grants or denies your Secret clearance. During this time, you will be granted what's called an Interim clearance. This is what you will need on day 1 for a DoD job.   Once you find that and find a job you're qualified for, make sure to get your Comptia Security+ and a MICROSOFT cert. This is important. Once those are in line, here is the type of job you can walk into. If I had my CCNA, I would be making around 80-100k right now because I have a Top Secret clearance which is in high demand currently. I just can't get my head around all the terminology and commands.   http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/jobs/jobdetails.aspx?APath=2.31.0.0.0&job_did=J3L5LR62MWD2R43NXQT&showNewJDP=yes&IPath=ILKV0A&2015=true  Hope that's helpful.

Once again - do you have reasons to change that, or are you just blindly following the best practices?  From the description, I assume you have a flat L2 network between three sites. That's the only problem I can see (inter-site STP over unreliable media is a call for disaster), you should probably turn to routing between sites. Use of VLAN1 for everything but voice and guest access could be totally fine, depending on your security policy.  Be lazy, keep it simple. Something that's listed in best practices could provide no actual benefits for you while complicating the setup. Overcomplication leads to occasional outages."

That's how I read your post, but rereading it, I'm thinking that you meant that's how you wanted to number the VLANs. Your job is much easier now then. Just assign people to different vlans, terminate them at the firewall, allow all between the networks. That's the same security policy you currently have in place and having the vlan segmentation will lower the broadcast traffic on your hardware."

From what you're describing, you basically have 1 private network port from which you can hang multiple ""sites"" off of, but they will all be within the same VPN. Typically how this is done, is that you BGP peer with CL on the /30. That way, as you add more sites to the VPN, you will learn those automatically, because each end-site will also be BGP peering with CL at the edge."
networking,3awvk2,notpudding,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:10:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, this. You either have a trunked link where each VLAN represents a discreet VPN/VRF or you have a single routed link all on the same VPN/VRF.  When in doubt, pull your SE in. There should be one on your CL account team."

We didn't have to do the same thing when setting up mobility groups for internal WLC's.  **edit: I just noticed it on my WLCs.  lol I remember getting so frustrated with this.

You need to be self-aware and really look at your knowledge from the outside in and decide whether you're skilled enough to hold up in a mid-level position or not.  Remember, although experience and education usually add to your overall skill level, that doesn't mean you're unskilled just because you don't have a lot of experience or certifications. I'm not saying you are skilled or aren't skilled, but you need to judge your own skills, not compare to others with more or less experience.  I know guys who have been in the field for 15+ years that I ran circles around after my second year as an engineer. I'm sure those guys could get into a bunch of senior level interviews if they fluffed up their resume, but they'd probably never land a senior job because they're content with not learning more so hey would fail the interviews.  All that being said I would apply to all of the positions you think you could feasibly work in. If you get an interview then the company obviously thinks you could be skilled enough to at least give you a chance. Worst case scenario you do an interview and don't get a job, best case you do land a mid-level job. Even if you're not prepared for it you'll learn a lot and be better because of it."
networking,3ayrwn,The_Packeteer,3,Wed Jun 24 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"All that being said I would apply to all of the positions.   Was going to say this, apply for all the jobs you think you could handle and let the hiring folks decide if you're not qualified. While it is all relative most people agree that CCNA is entry level, CCNP is something you get to validate that you have a solid mid-tier set of networking skills after you've been in the game for a few years, I read somewhere before that Cisco gears the CCNP exams towards someone who already has several years of networking experience."
networking,3ayrwn,SnoopyTRB,3,Wed Jun 24 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"That's usually what I see, but obviously there are exceptions in everything.  Most guys I know with CCNA are either entry guys, 2-3 years experienced guys, or IT generalists that needed to learn some networking basics.  Most guys I know with CCNP have been in the game for 5+ years and are full on networking folks.  CCNP is a weird cert because there are a lot of CCNPs who are pretty average, and there are a lot of CCNPs who effectively function just as well as CCIEs but the time spent on the CCIE isn't worth it to them. Of course a lot of people can function on a ""CCIE level"" without having a CCIE, but I've known more highly-functioning CCNPs than I have CCNA/JNCIAs/Uncertified folks."
networking,3ayrwn,The_Packeteer,2,Wed Jun 24 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"Well you're in a bit of a spot. I took a pretty big pay cut when I went from sales to a junior networking position. I worked my way back up pretty quick. Sometimes you have to take a step down to get on the right path which will have a lot higher potential.  Alternatively, you can always work on simulations, certs, or even buy some lab gear to work with. But nothing will replace real life experience. An interviewer might well sniff out your lack of real world knowledge if you apply for a mid level job. Technically a CCNA with very little hands on would only get you into a junior position anyway.  If you build a lab, do some hands on and get a CCNP you might be able to get into a mid-level position, but it will still be difficult without some years of real world experience. Ultimately at some point you will probably need to bite the bullet and switch jobs to start getting the job experience if this is the field you really want."

I think a big (incorrect) assumption of mine was assuming that CCENT -> junior, CCNA -> mid, and CCNP -> senior, without really giving thought to CCIE, etc. Dunno.   Thanks for the response."
networking,3ayrwn,The_Packeteer,3,Wed Jun 24 17:01:20 2015 UTC,"The certifications have little to do with the level of engineer you are.  I could consider CCNA a junior level cert. If you're a CCNA with 2-3+ years experience then you may function well in a mid-level role. CCNP is usually mid-level, but a CCNP with 5-7+ years of experience can often function at a senior level.  In reality the certifications aren't a real good judge of your overall skill level. Experience is important, but there is a difference in quality of experience and quantity of experience so even that isn't the best judge."
networking,3ayrwn,AndyofBorg,3,Wed Jun 24 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"What it comes down to in my completely unofficial opinion is: Real World Experience with no book knowledge = often decent, but also often not very exceptional either (these are often the 9-5'ers that just do the bare minimum to get by) Book Knowledge with no real world experience = usually a huge liability to have working on a production network, but they usually have potential to ramp up to be a good engineer Experience + Book Knowledge (certs/study) = The best way. You will learn certain things only from books, and you'll learn certain things only be experiencing them yourself. Combining both IMO is the way to really become something exceptional."

networking,3axeyj,Dankleton,2,Wed Jun 24 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"I've seen something similar before, but it took a very specific network setup to trigger it.  In my case it was 100% packet loss for short periods when there wasn't load on the network - but everything was fine when there was.  Firstly, are you seeing any errors on any switch interfaces?  That's the first place to look.  Packets don't just disappear, they are lost because they are corrupt (which gets logged) or because a buffer overflowed (which gets logged) or because they get switched to the wrong destination (which doesn't get logged.)  Is the 30% packet loss to a single destination or many?  If it's to many destinations, do some have 100% packet loss and others 0?  If it's to one destination, do you have multiple links to that destination?  Is there any difference in the CAM table on the switch between when you don't have packet loss and when you do?"
networking,3axeyj,jpeek,2,Wed Jun 24 09:05:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the replies. It's our Solarwinds monitoring platform which notices the packet loss to the device itself. We have another switch on the inside of this one and that get's alerts at the same time indicating it's everything to the switch and inside also.    The logs show it's VERY minimal traffic but it's always minimal traffic through this particular switch. About 20Mbps at peak and then during the quiet times we see a peak of around 8Mbps. No spikes above that at all.    It could just be on it's way out and I'll do some proper testing and logs on it once it's out of production.  Thanks

networking,3axeyj,sysvival,2,Wed Jun 24 13:14:48 2015 UTC,"I've had some similar cases. It has to do with timeouts of arp/mac tables, and probably your router is not the one to blame.  In our case, it happened because of an asymetric flow in the network: Traffic from one machine to another would go through one router/switch on the way from machine a/b, but would take another path for the return packets. Especially during periods of low traffic, this caused mac/forwarding tables on switches to expire and not get filled up again.  Verifying that this is the issue is easy: keep a ping running from your Solarwinds machine to the switch, and keep a ping running from the switch to the Solarwinds machine. If this is the cause, this will keep things going through the night.  The root cause in our case was that we had some Linux machines with separate interfaces in multiple VLANs. These VLANs themselves were also connected to one another by a router on one of the switches. In Linux, the networking stack decides which interface to use for sending out a packet after it's already put in the source address of the packet. So in our case, reply packets went out of a different interface than the Syn had come in on, and this caused the two halves of a TCP connection to take different paths. With ARP or switch forwarding timers expiring (don't quite remember which at the moment) and no other traffic to populate those, the asymetric paths caused either flooding or complete loss of communication, depending on the particular setup. Note that a switch going into flooding might also cause rate limiting, and be perceived as packet loss."

networking,3asq3d,tlodude,19,Tue Jun 23 05:10:57 2015 UTC,"I've spent the past two months on this same project as we are currently using Solarwinds, and looking to get a new monitoring solution that actually gives us the info we need. Let me try to save you a little time. I've done testing on a TON of monitoring solutions, set up test instances, and weighed the benefits/drawbacks of each. Disclaimer These are the results of me setting each of these up, trying to get at least a few nodes added and monitored, and then shown off to others. I'm a networking guy and NOT a sysadmin or a Linux guru, so for those that live in Linux and write config files for fun when they go home at night, be aware.  Observium  Pros   Pretty Interface Fast config Nice graphing features   Cons   Requires all hosts to be added by DNS, will not add by IP Younger development cycle Less user plugins than other similar solutions   Zabbix  Pros   Relatively easy deployment   Cons   All the manual implementation of Nagios Core, without the same level of user support   PRTG  Pros   Windows based solution makes set up and management easy Beautiful interface  for monitoring   Cons   Struggled to keep the server running solidly for more than even a few hours.   ICINGA2  Pros   Beautiful interface as well   Cons    Not personally wanting to manage Linux config files to add my hosts and services one of my primary motivators was being able to implement a web config tool. Unfortunately either through my own inexperience with Linux, or just because there isn't much, I was unable to get a web config working and abandoned the effort after a couple days of working on it.   Check_Mk  Pros   Easily one of the best interfaces for nagios core out there in terms of functionality Being just a front end for nagios allows support for all the existing nagios plugins automatically the check_mk client for server monitoring is easy to get up and running and works wonderfully without any need to mess with much They have a rack mounted appliance for sale relatively inexpensively that makes deployment cake (This however is a bit deceptive, as seen below)   Cons   Their yearly subscription cost is done by service, leading to an enormous hidden cost. I went from expecting to pay 3 to 4 grand for the total product to getting a quote for 12k with a 9k yearly expense.    OMD  Pros   INSANELY easy to deploy, and allows you to kind of roll your own nagios build with all the bells and whistles, without having to spend three weeks reading all the documentation for every plugin just to get started.  the check_mk interface makes the set up a snap, and being able to use different interfaces is a definite boon   Cons   There is no commercial support level for OMD that I was able to locate, so unless you are comfortable with forum support and trying to figure things out on your own, you might want to look at more commercial solutions At least the debian package I was using seemed to be using an older version of nagios than the current nagios core, that made getting help in nagios forums a little difficult   Nagios Core  Pros   Tons of support in forums Free   Cons   Adding a host to nagios requires writing out the config in scripts for the host, and any services you want to use. Despite buying a book and reading through it, and watching tons of videos, nothing made this process any faster or easier.  OH DEAR GOD IT'S ALL SCRIPTS AAAARRGGGHHHHH   Nagios XI  Pros   All the flexibility and capability of nagios, with some truly excellent configuration tools Has a pretty affordable ( if you are leaving solarwinds) annual cost Has some nice additional features like capacity planning in the enterprise version that make executive types happy Offer a five day instructor lead training class for a reasonable price to help you get started.   Cons   If you don't have a decent budget to build your solution, then it's probably best to try to work with OMD It's still Nagios, anything that you want to do that someone else hasn't gotten on the exchange means you are still going to have to figure out the scripting. nrpe and requires a significantly more involved install process to get everything you want monitored going as compared to check_mk  In the end it came down to check_mk's appliance solution or the nagios XI solution. The surprise cost of support with check_mk ended up swinging the choice to XI. I can't say if it's the right choice or not as I just got the product set up, and I'm waiting to really start implementing it after I do the training class I signed up for with them, but I will let you know.   P.S. If you are using Solarwinds NCM solution to back up configs like we are, I was able to find an absolutely AMAZING solution called Net Line Dancer. It can be VERY costly for a lot of nodes, but the things it can do absolutely blew my mind. We managed to scale things back to the more minimum requirements and fit it in our budget, but if config management is something you need to do, take the time to download the demo and give it a spin. I was immensely happy with it. We deployed it to production only a few weeks ago and in that time I've been able to eliminate over 150 ""forgotten"" local accounts on our devices from old net admins, push an IOS update to over 400 devices without an incident, and I can daily see any device that have unsaved changes to the running config."

You can hack into the sql and get data what even the api can't and do any kind of integration you want with relatively ease. It supports all kind of data access: data polling, data pushing, remote ssh, active checks, remote script execution, snmp and so on. It has good AAA support with users, user groups, read/write access and LDAP. It's template support is good and you can create complex setups with templates, macros, and per-host data.

They will tell you which IP in the range the router interface has and you use that as your gateway.  If you have a single static IP (tbh rare when the circuit is presented on ethernet) They'll usually give you the IP and your gateway is the other address left in the /30.   It really depends how the ISP has configured your service, so really just ask them."
networking,3avi4q,Skilldibop,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:12:37 2015 UTC,"At the most basic level, you need:  Interface with an IP Address and mask.  Let's suppose it's 1.1.1.1 /30  interface gi0/1  ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.252 no shut   Now you also need a static route to the ISP:  ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 1.1.1.2 1   1.1.1.2 being the ISP on the other end of your local interface(1.1.1.1). The ""1"" on the end of the route statement is simply the Administrative Distance."
networking,3avi4q,shortstop20,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:10:20 2015 UTC,In this example does the ISP provide you with the IP to set the static route to?
networking,3avi4q,shortstop20,2,Tue Jun 23 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, they will provide that IP.   ISP device<-----Cable---->Your device  Static route goes to ""ISP device"""

networking,3avi4q,Apachez,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:12:56 2015 UTC,We prefer to use linknets (p2p) that are different from the ranges that are being routed.  If you use a public or private ip for the linknet is a matter of taste (and what the ISP will offer you).  For example using x.x.x.x/30 or /29 (the later to have room for VRRP/HSRP setups) for the linknet and then get y.y.y.y/z routed that way.  This way the ISP (if we use a pure static routing setup) will route y.y.y.y/z towards your ip at the x.x.x.x/30 or /29 range and you will route 0.0.0.0/0 towards the ISP ip in the x.x.x.x/30 or /29 range.

If you get replies, then the MTU is larger than the value you set, if you don't it's smaller.  Tools like NMAP might even be able to sweep a range of sizes or increment the size each time so you can effectively scan to find the maximum path MTU.  OR if ICMP is allowed fully you can just ping with your local MTU size as payload and you'll get a packet too big ICMP response where it's dropped which should also contain the hop's MTU in the response.

networking,3aubtm,m0wax,5,Tue Jun 23 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"For layer 1 testing, you will need:   Power Meter OTDR Fiber Microscope Cleaning Supplies   For Layer 2 and optionally 3, you will want a device capable of a BERT (Bit Error Rate Test).  These can be used to test not only the fiber for transmission quality, but also the end-to-end path including all active gear.    I'm lucky enough to work for an OEM's Services group and have all of this provided to me.  Purchasing single units of these devices can be quite expensive from what I understand.  Look into renting them if you are trying to troubleshoot a single problem.  However, I recommend that anyone with Inside/Outside plant fiber have at least a power meter, scope, and cleaning supplies.  I've not used them personally, but I've seen fiberstore.com suggested around here.    My personal preference is JDSU equipment, but I hear good things about EXFO products, and that EXFO can be had at a lower price.  I'm sure others in the sub have recommendations.    In a OTDR class, I was told that 60-80% of fiber issues are caused by dirt, with half of the remainder caused by macro-bends in the fiber.  ""Inspect before you connect!""  EDIT: Formatting"

It's always worked well, provided the information I needed, and I've never looked at how a feature was implemented and thought it was obviously stupid/deficient."

I hate to tell any fellow network magicians to just hire someone and miss out on a learning opportunity, but in this case it's a valid option.  Not only can the equipment be cost-prohibitive, the knowledge required to operate the equipment can have a steep learning curve.

Things to watch out for is stuff like roaming profiles and such (no fun if the client downloaded or for some other reason handled files that are several gigabytes in size, this mean that the profile must be fully copied before the client is let in - with multiple gigabytes on busy network this can take same time so the client leaves and reconnects and gets to another server who then will also try to download all these gigabytes which saturates the network even more so you end up in a bad loop. In the end both servers will then try to commit back the profile to the fileserver making the network and fileserver even less happier).  Folder redirection (if we speak windows environments) are often better (specially if this can be in combination with a readonly account which can be used as a skeleton for the user who logs in)."

While everything is working great today we had a few hurdles with:   undersizing the nutanix nodes (memory) we made a few silly decisions during the initial setup such as persistent disk application provisioning is also a PITA and vmware's application packager leaves a lot to be desired. updating the gold image isn't as quick as we thought (more so rolling it to users) -success with hardware pass through varies per device and software (ie jabber needs cisco's vmxe to pass audio traffic to the Virtual desktop yet windows sees it and can use it without issue)   That said the users have embraced it and both them and management like the way it's made our workforce more mobile (read more working from home for $0/hr).

networking,3aun8d,daynomate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:27:23 2015 UTC,I'm really keen to try it here (1000+ users with large private WAN). One thing I've heard from everyone who's done it is that the capacity planning and design needs to be good - there's less room for mistakes than with fat clients.
networking,3aun8d,MinimusNadir,2,Tue Jun 23 23:26:32 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely true.  You need to do a LOT of research,  analysis, and planning, or you will regret it, deeply."
networking,3aun8d,pharos92,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:42:39 2015 UTC,"VDI is great for working remotely, for sure. But you'll never beat the fluidity of a physical workstation.. If you're after the one-size-fits-all approach, then VDI - it's easy as shit to manage. If you're after performance, local."
networking,3aun8d,Apachez,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:05:29 2015 UTC,"The downside is that you will get a higher demand on your network (if the network is down then your client really is down if you use VDI - compared to regular client who then could continue to work on their word-file or whatever even if the network is down).  Another common downside is how you will scale your VDI solution. I mean lets say you got 100 clients, should you take aim that all these 100 will be able to be logged in at the same time and have a great experience or will you just take aim for lets say 50 concurrent users?  Another downside is that various kind of streaming (specially the videobased one) isnt that great (sure there are various ""accelerators"" but that still often means transcoding on the server along with a 20-60Mbit/s pipe to the client to feed the video, compared to the original feed from lets say youtube which might be just 1-5Mbit/s).  The upside is that you will save costs on the client side (a few more muscular servers are often cheaper then a lot of higher end desktops), you will also save alot when it comes to licensing of antivirus and such. Dont forget the maintenance costs (maintaining lets say 10 servers is often easier than maintaining 100+ regular clients).  Another good thing with VDI's is that you can make them ""start from known good configuration"" (like a readonly image) to lower the attacksurface for malware (compare to a regular client where malware could operate for years unless detected by the antivirus engine).  You will also greatly save costs in administration of the clients (you can use various thinclient software such as 2xos, thinstation or whatever to either boot from a cd/dvd disc or to pbx-boot the clients) because the clients will just have a stripped down kernel + gui + rdp-client (or whatever protocol you might use). I mean there is not that much to troubleshoot on the clientside.  Another upside is that you can more easily lock down what the clients will be able to do and by that limit usb drives and whatever from function (simply by not allowing usb feeds through the rdp session or whatever protocol you might use). This way it will get harder for evil clients to get in bad stuff into your environment but also to steal the original files (you still need some kind of role access control and logging and such and the evil client can still just take a photo of its screen but compared to exposing everything to a regular client a thin client can, if you need to, far easier be locked down compared to a regular client).  Also since using thinclients you wont need harddrives on the clients which will not only save a few watts of electricity and cooling on each client but also by design makes it less likely to leak sensitive data through broken harddrives where some support tech comes and picks it up (without following your regulations of physically destroy the broken drives at your own premises or whatever routines you might have).  Another bonus is that something like 1GB of RAM will be more than enough on the clients (using a regular client these days you often want 4GB or more).  But sure there are of course situations where you still might need regular clients even if the majority of your workstations are VDI-based. Something to watch out for is the licensing that Microsoft will apply on your organisation for using VDI's (if you would use windowsservers to host the VDI-environment). Here you can save some costs by looking at other vendors such as 2xos and such to perhaps using ubuntu or similar as VDI-guest and 2xos for the virtualization (VDI) part."

The previous week corporate email was unusuable for about 60,000 employees for about 2 days.

These types of outages are mostly a result of discovering new bugs, or unknown conditions in the network.  However, if you are being a cowboy and just changing stuff on the network without testing, peer-review, and/or following procedure, you could easily be terminated.  In general, management understands stuff can (and will) go wrong despite good practices and solid engineering - it is just a fact of life when dealing with technology - particularly when pushing the scale of infrastructure to its technical limits. Management gets pissed-off if it looks like you are not being careful enough.  At one provider, we had an ""award"" that was passed around if you caused a major fuck-up. It was a bit of ""badge of honor"" as it usually wouldn't even be possible to receive it unless you were doing big things to begin with. It was understood that, sooner or later, you were going to be the one to fuck-up if you were doing this stuff on a daily basis.  Also taken into consideration was the sheer quantity of stuff you did without incident. Sort of a ""batting average"". You generally need to have a pretty high batting average to survive such work for any length of time. Otherwise, it just looks like you are incompetent.  In the wafer fab outage I mentioned above, I had probably done 10,000 successful changes in the network before that one happened. And, I just stumbled on a bug. I got bitched out for not followed proper procedure, and costing the company a few million, but, they knew the work I had done over the previous year had probably saved the company from bankruptcy (this was a ""Fortune 50"" company at the time).

I can't get into too many details but he was generally pretty good at his job and made a bad mistake in what would have otherwise been a fairly routine change.  It would be akin to updating an ACL but mistakenly denying traffic. The error in the ACL was not even initially his mistake but proper verification of the work would have prevented a larger rollout of the mistake.   The mistake itself was easy enough to make but because of its seemingly routine nature he was not more careful. He got very fired largely because of the scale of the impact and others involved in the process of approving the work to be done without catching the mistake were also reprimanded.  Over several years and thousands of network updates he probably had about 3 things with his name on it that impacted traffic but most were short term but the one he got fired for was an outage.   It definitely adds to the stress of the job for the other engineers. Some of them feel like it doesn't matter what their standing is they are perpetually one solid outage to their name from being out the door with no severance, no insurance, and no unemployment (he was denied these things).  We get to work with some amazing equipment and I generally love my job but there is very very little tolerance for mistakes. A lot of people who could be great engineers hate the pressure of knowing how big of an impact mistakes can have and when you make one it doesn't just make you look bad, the team looks bad with you, and the company with it. If you end up with employees you know are not qualified to do some of the work you have to just let them coast mostly rather than allow them to do any real harm.  It creates an environment where only a few people are trusted to do higher risk work and add limited budgets and understaffing and you have a recipe for an extremely high burnout rate.  Capacity demand means I have replaced several whole iterations of our network under this environment sometimes working hours that would make China blush.

networking,3app78,nothing429,10,Mon Jun 22 17:02:04 2015 UTC,"I have a story for you. At the college I went to there was a rather large broadcast storm that pretty much killed the entire campus network. Apparently it started in our networking classroom because of an ethernet cable being attached to another port on the same switch.  Thing is, there is a layer-3 switch in our classroom to keep us somewhat isolated from the main part of the network (our own little broadcast domain). It's locked in a cabinet, no student can physically access it, and I'm assuming that no one aside from management had remote access either. If the switch was configured correctly, the outage should've been isolated to our classroom, regardless of our isolated LAN's status, right? Apparently not.  In the end, the issue was concluded to be the fault of the students (no one in particular, no one was punished), and definitely not the fault of the college's network management. Our professors used it as a teaching opportunity. Understandably though, our networking professors have no positive opinion of their own university's network management team."

Apparently not.   This happened to me a few years after the above incident. I thought the loop was my fault because I screwed up a bridge and brought down the broadcast domain it was on. My boss thought it was his fault because he didn't have STP enabled. Campus thought it was their fault because STP was enabled, but didn't unblock the port for that particular VLAN once the loop was cleared. It was only up for about 30 seconds before I realized what happened and yanked the ethernet cables out."

It basically boiled down to me returning from another project after several weeks and the lead engineer being out and totally unreachable with an absolutely crazy site manager. I was forced to rush through connecting some things and borrowed some modules from the lab rack where it turned out that the SAN replication group was testing things for the same project.  They should have put it in a temporary rack if they didn't want me to think I had free reign to use the gear in a pinch. The site manager was fired a few weeks later since I was about the 6th person he had gotten rid of in 3-4 months and somewhere along the line, someone had proof that the guy was either hallucinating or lying about conversations about task assignments and change windows that we never had.   More recently, I can't say that people were fired for the technical mistake itself, but usually because they didn't follow all the byzantine change control procedures and then goofed on a minor change like adding a vlan to a trunk port.   Some other people were given final written warnings but were basically targeted for firing my upper management so when they did get fired, it was usually for absurd reasons. One guy got fired because he fixed an outage caused by the cabling team by moving the cables back instead of waking up a 70 year old man at 3am to drive back in and fix it, because he wasn't supposed to do cabling anymore."

networking,3app78,thatgeekinit,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:57:20 2015 UTC,Less opportunity for error: add keeps you from accidentally missing any currently allowed vlans. You don't have to copy/paste.

networking,3app78,DorkJedi,5,Tue Jun 23 06:49:41 2015 UTC,"Not network specific, but I was fired for someone else's mistake.    I was a contract consultant, called out to a HUGE hosting site to help with the backup system. Pretty routine, except they had just gotten 15,000 tapes from a sister site that was closing down. Tapes are expensive, so these were to be recycled.  Fair enough. We were running low on scratch tapes anyway. Importing foreign tapes for scratch is time consuming, so i write a perl script to handle it. Due to the extreme risk of a data loss if a tape is used out of order, I explain to all the employees that this cannot happen. I segregate the tapes and put a big sign warning DO NOT USE YET!! DATA LOSS WILL OCCUR!!  Then I proceed to import the tapes and add them to the scratch pool. The silo can process 300 at a time, and there is a list of available scratch that can be ejected and moved over to the main silo at will.  Good system, right?  Yea, you guessed it. An employee took a half dozen tapes, imported them and used them to do a backup for a HUGE customer who wanted to try a live rollout of a new version. they wanted a fresh full backup before they begin. They begin, several hours later the fishie floats to the top of the fishbowl and they demand a restore ASAP!!  Now the script has reached those tape numbers, added them to scratch.. and since they are in the main silo, currently being written to in a backup job.  So they fire me. Why? Because the customer demanded a firing, and they felt bad firing the idiot as he was their employee and I was just a contractor."

Management had been harping on us about literally putting red tape on the live fibers during a migration, and I had simply gotten tunnel vision about the tape and pulled the wrong one.  Nothing compares to the feeling of disconnecting an OC-192 and hearing nearly every single person on the conference call drop.  At least the cause was obvious and I still had the fiber in my hand, so I jammed it back in and everything restored within seconds.  In the end the customer didn't care since we had a change control and it was in the window, my boss just laughed when I told him.  In my former IT life, I had a well respected Senior Engineer tell me, ""If you don't break things once in a while, you are not really doing any work.""

networking,3app78,BobertMk2,6,Tue Jun 23 00:10:01 2015 UTC,"Is that cell tower thing you described something you've actually seen happen?   Yeah, you're right. Most good engineers wouldn't be in a situation to cause such an issue, but things do happen sometimes. Most of the mistakes I've seen stem from changes authorized during production. Most companies I've worked for didn't offer overtime or comp time for guys who spend 12 hours on a weekend doing a change so we tried to get changes approved during the day as much as possible, surprisingly our management approved most of them. That probably wasn't responsible of us, but I tend to point a portion of the blame to the company for expecting us to be completely okay with spending our weekends at work on a regular basis with no added compensation in the form of time or money.   I do know a guy who was doing an approved software upgrade on our Secondary ACS server that we used as 802.1x authentication functioning both as wired and wirelss authentication for entire org during production hours. The ACS servers were mirroring one another and the versions didn't need to match for the config to mirror. The idea was to reload the OS of one on Thursday and one on Friday. He submitted a changes and it was approved to do during production since it shouldn't have had any impact. I don't remember the exact complications but the primary got fried from a storm during the upgrade and the secondary lost it's configuration and before it could mirror its config from the primary. The entire organization couldn't authenticate for most of that day. We had to turn off 802.1x on all of our switches while we reconfigured the secondary and got a replacement for the primary.  The guy was easily the best engineer on our team. He didn't get fired, but I wouldn't always agree that just because you're a good engineer doesn't mean you're not vulnerable being the point of blame for an outage."

We had a journeyman engineer coordinating a splice for a ring of Sprint and Verizon towers. The day before the maintenance period he had scheduled he went in to adjust the rep for the ring to accommodate his splice. Brought the ring down and locked us out of our management vlan. Keep in mind he did this as people were walking out to lunch (the maintenance period was set for 1am). Took them two hours to bring the ring back up.    Ya, he got fired.   And what I mean about having good procedures set up, I'm mostly talking about covering your ass. If I'm working on carrier circuits or equipment that carrier carrier circuits, I do it during the pre-approved maintenance period, that was approved by my boss, my bosses boss, AND the customer. If I break something, yes it's my fault and I get the blame. But I told everyone that I might break something. Further, if I can't fix it, there is a chain of more senior engineers I can call upon to help me.   So long as I follow that procedure, there is almost no mistake I can make that would result in my termination.   It's when people try to cut corners or cover up their mistakes that get fired."

Since the resignation was not truly voluntary, it is in effect a termination. For example, when an employer makes life extremely difficult for an employee, to attempt to have the employee resign, rather than outright firing the employee, the employer is trying to effect a constructive discharge.  The exact legal consequences differ between different countries, but generally a constructive dismissal leads to the employee's obligations ending and the employee acquiring the right to make claims against the employer.  The employee may resign over a single serious incident or over a pattern of incidents. Generally, the employee must have resigned soon after the incident.

Sounds BS to me.   Basically, it must have been a very very very unique situation, and the switch he plugged in was likely not NEW (fresh out of the box).  I'd also be pointing fingers to the guys who configured VTP with the default domain name and no password."
networking,3app78,BGOOCHY,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:44:19 2015 UTC,VTP with the default domain name and no password   I know the password is optional. Is the domain name optional too? It's never occurred to me to even try to run VTP without a domain name configured...
networking,3app78,the-packet-thrower,4,Mon Jun 22 20:02:24 2015 UTC,A brand new switch wiped out your VTP database? Doesn't make sense. The VTP domain matched the one you're using in production? And somehow the configuration revision was higher than your production environment?

The SRX is a reliable platform in regards to a routing/switching/firewalling perspective. IPS & AppID/AppFW work well. However if you are primarily wanting to focus on AV/Anti-Spam/Anti-Malware/URL-Filtering, etc I would recommend Palo Alto. Both firewalls are great, and each has its benefits.   Palo Alto is going to be quite a bit more expensive but I imagine you can get a device to fit your needs. I believe the SRX to be a more reliable (stable) platform which has a better cli configuration setup than Palo, but the GUI for Palo is also a night and day difference compared to the Juniper equivalent."

SRX is a multi-functional device that has most of what you'll need for a branch device - UTM and some other features like that will require a separate license, but you probably won't need that. Besides if you only have Cisco experience, its worth trying out Junos. Once you get hooked its hard to go back to IOS (my totally biased opinion:)"

Not you personally, although that is extremely important, but your company long term (I always have a goal to work myself out of a job).  Change is good, and change is needed, just make sure it is not too much change from a support structure.  From a cost perspective, who cares about the hardware, honestly that is one of the cheaper investments, especially for small companies who use them for 10-15 years without hardware refresh.  Depending on your location and your remote office location, again chose a product that can fit the future you envision, both support and architect...  Me personally, I feel you may fit better in the fortinet or sonicwall market from a quick judge... Their GUI is simple enough to maintain and they have features you can use for the future to possibly help eliminate circuit costs (if you're inclined to do that), and it is an easy to learn interface for next hires and replacements. Sonicwall seems to have a larger historical support structure from what I have seen."

There are different sizing guides out there, i can say we have a fortigate 200d in production and it does 600mb of ipsec all in their ASIC, doesnt even use the cpu.  ~100mbit of nat traffic is like 2-4% cpu.  200mbit of web protect, ips, dlp, basically everything was around ~20-25% cpu.  Just got a SG230 in for a POC yesterday so i plan to start playing with it tomorrow, we will see how it goes.  As for pricing, at our discount levels, which are pretty good, sophos is the cheapest, fortinet is a little more than that, and cisco 4000 series (replaces 29xx series) with smartnet is between 2x and 3x the price for what is really less UTM type features.  We have been using cisco routers forever, but are looking at replacing ~130 of them next year at our branch office sites and cisco was out of the running pretty much right away due to price."

They have custom asic which offloads some tasks such as IPSEC, simple nat traffic etc along with having a regular CPU.  Sophos only has a regular CPU.  Also if you read on the sophos/astaro forums they use snort for IPS, snort is single threaded and as a result limits IPS throughput to a max of 300mbit per traffic stream with a high end CPU, for the 210 it would be less than that.  They can launch multiple instances to handle different traffic streams, so there is that.  Fortinet doesnt have that issue.  Given that, i will know more in a few weeks once i have some time with the SG230."

It only does crypto map type stuff, which obviously you cant do a routing protocol over.  So if you want to do a routing protocol to a sophos, it has to be between it and another sophos where they run their propitiatory sophos-sophos tunnel.

networking,3ar8uh,geritzzz,3,Mon Jun 22 21:27:10 2015 UTC,"Case A would be correct. The reason Case B is wrong is think about e.g. a ping packet. How does the router in the lower right know which interface to send a packet destined for a particular IP out of? Remember each interface has it's own IP, so you need routes for all of them to move traffic around. If you have conflicting subnets you won't be able to move traffic due to the conflicts, or at best move traffic suboptimally (it'll pick the wrong interface but still work because you're lucky).  What I think might be confusing you is the fact that many designs might start off with Case B. All primary uplinks from 10.0.15/24 and all secondaries from 10.0.55/24. However, this would be for summary purposes in higher levels of the network (so the core didn't need to know about the individual links in the individual areas two layers downstream, just info about it's directly connected subnets and what supernets are behind them). You wouldn't use the /24's on the interfaces themselves... you'd subnet that /24 into e.g. /30's or /31's for use on the point to points."

It won't change anything, your backbone routers can be in the same LAN segment and peered with each other full-mesh.  They will have /30 networks to each closet and the closets will advertise their local networks.    The positive part of this design is that each closet can re-use the same VLAN numbering for administrative ease because of the L3 boundary, just each VLAN at each closet will have a unique IP subnet.  Is there a need for the backbones to be in the same LAN segment like HSRP/VRRP or other L2 extensions?"

Always keep the backbone area as simple as possible by avoiding a  complex mesh. Consider using a LAN solution for the backbone. The transit across the  backbone is always one hop, latency is minimized, and the backbone is a simple design that  converges quickly.""  Would this design break the L3 down the access layer model?"
networking,3ar8uh,kWV0XhdO,2,Tue Jun 23 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Nope, they just want all backbone devices in OSPF area 0 which is fine.  Won't affect closet routing at all.  Just think about packets going from a closet through the network and see if there would be any issues during routing lookups.    At the end of the day we are just sharing destination prefixes.  If the prefix is available in the routing table and a port to send it on, then the packet is routed correctly.  L3 at the closet is great because you eliminate STP, lessen the L2 failure/broadcast domain, faster failure convergence, greater ECMP, ability to re-use VLAN numbers and summarization."

But that's not how it's usually (ever?) done.  The reason folks assign dedicated subnets (usually a /30 or /31) to each uplink has to do with routing convergence.  When IP interfaces link directly to one another (option A), failure of one of those interfaces causes an immediate failure of the neighboring device's interface, and routes learned by both ends are immediately withdrawn from their respective tables.  When peering with several neighbors over a transit network (option B), failure of an interface goes un-noticed by neigboring devices until upper layer protocols (on the core and all of the peer distribution layer devices) detect the problem.

This isn't a valid configuration in most cases, and many platforms won't even let you do it.  The scenario I had in mind was to have all of the distribution devices uplink share a common broadcast domain. The core would only have a single IP address in this case.  On most platforms, you'd instantiate a VLAN, plug distribution devices into ports on that VLAN.  On your Linux host, you'd need to:   clear the configuration from eth0 and eth2 instantiate a bridge with brctl addbr add eth0 and eth2 to the bridge with brctl addif put an IP address onto the bridge with ip addr add"

Both the 3850 and the 3750-X is right around the same price will offer better performance with minor price differences (As will the new 3650's) - on top of that I think the 3750-X's could be going EOL soon considering the 3850's do basically everything and more they do for almost the same price.

This is fairly DIY and may cause more headaches than you'd like especially if you want to make the network scale with VLAN's, subnets, and redundant connections that provide hardware and software resiliency.  Since I'm familiar with the Cisco/Meraki side, I'd go with something like two MS220's as the L2 core and a MX64W firewall/VPN appliance for L3 which includes an access point.  The current design doesn't have any core redundancy.  Ideally you'd have an L3 core instead of router-on-a-stick but that few users won't make a difference.  This yields an enterprise-level network and support that is still low cost.  Only downside to Meraki is a licensing model that renews every 3 years, really easy to configure the switches and firewall.  The network should be stable, not just cheap.  With a customer-facing medical office, you'll want to spend a bit more early on so you can grow easily and not have to worry about the network to meet your needs.

Just some items to think about because once this equipment is purchased, that's it for probably 5 years so make sure you're okay with administering it.  Also for Meraki, Cisco owns them and it is very easy to configure via GUI, just another option out there that takes out much of the guesswork for config across multiple platforms.  Again, if you reach out to them, they will send you sample equipment to try out."

So we double-check and yep, I can peer with the MLX from any source regardless of the rACL. Great! Open a ticket.   First, Brocade suggests that the logging feature that is enabled for the rACLs is causing the issue, known bug, etc. We turn that off and it seems to work, then it doesn't. Back to the drawing board. Then Brocade suggests we block the traffic the other way...toward the MPLS PE...which completely defeats the entire point of the rACLs on the MLX! We want to protect the MLX! So then they find another bug that explains the issue, we upgrade, try to re-enable, and figure out that now we have to adjust the rACL CAM partition because the ACLs are consuming too much memory.

If you are only taking in one full table, then just filter it to your default route - this is my one complaint with the MT's, v6.x is slow to do BGP route processing and to do route table lookups with 'complex' filters. This has gotten better in 6.2x and up but still lacks - apparently a lot better in v7.x (still only alpha, no beta releases yet)  Having said that I talk IPv4 and IPv6 to about 15 different peers, 3 of which are internal, 1 is downstream, the rest are either transit or IX - run probably half a gigabit aggregated throughput at peak, about 8 Simple Queue reading over about 100-150mbit of that traffic and often limiting at full rate, the router barely hits 20% CPU, and thats with all load pumping through 1 single router.  I have multiple routers installed - one is configured to auto-failover, and I could easily move some services over for load balance, but I haven't 'yet'.  All-in-all, my experience has been positive. There are concerns and drawbacks - those of which you have to make a business case to see if they are worth it (this setup cost us <$4k AUD, where as similar Cisco featureset + performance was looking at $30k+ with redundancy).  If you do your research and pick the RouterOS revision that will fit your needs then it should be stable - and lab your updates if you ever do. There is a strong network of consultants around the major countries that can help professionally if required also.  TL;DR - IF you need to save money - Mikrotik is a great platform - however if you have the budget for Cisco or other higher grade gear, they are always still recommended."

Anyway, for a simple setup, you may disreagard mikrotik haters : it DOES run just fine, you just have to take a few specificities into consideration, and Keep It Simple, Stupid.

I'm pretty picky about making sure all of my IPv6 addresses reverse resolve, but not all admins are since IPv6 frequently isn't considered to be ""as important"" as IPv4 (a mistake, IMO).  If there are different numbers of traceroute hops returned, keep in mind that IPv4 and IPv6 operate independently.

This is exactly why I'm posting my question to Reddit: I know very little about how this stuff works (I don't even know what on-net or off-net traffic means), and I have a general distrust of Comcast as a company. These two facts combined make the speed test results I was getting seem very strange/suspicious.  Put yourself in my shoes: your Internet starts acting up. You run some speed tests to see if it looks abnormal (you're paying for 50/down). Comcast's speed test results are consistently showing 50-90/down, while multiple other speed tests are way below 50; even down in the single digits. Doesn't that look suspicious (to someone who doesn't know much about this stuff?)  If you read my full, original question on /r/AskTechnology, I think you'll see that my goal from the beginning was to try to understand the discrepancies.

The VPN will almost certainly be connected to a firewall, outbound traffic initiating sessions will be fine, traffic returning that didn't leave via that firewall thus creating an session entry will be dropped, because firewalls are stateful - Routers don't care because they're not stateful.  The link to DHCP may be trivial or could be to do with the default gateway / ARP issues if you're using VRRP/HSRP or similar.  First place I'd start is the routing table at both core switches under normal operation and failover/failback conditions. You do not want ECMP to be happening with this setup."

Now one simple way to do it might be to just find some FTP server software that supports secure FTP.  I think FileZilla will but I'm not 100% sure.  That way all access is encrypted, and you don't even need the VPN.  The only downside then is anyone with the password can connect from anywhere.  You could work around this if your sites each have a static public IP from your ISP, just whitelist those IPs.  Hamachi would would as a VPN to get you site-to-site access.  You'd have to install Hamachi on each computer that needed FTP access.  You could also set up a site-to-site VPN.  That would involve programming the routers at each site to talk to the central office.  It would mean any employee at any office could easily access the FTP.  One gotcha- for most setups, each office will need to be on a different subnet.  For example, if Office #1's router is handing out 192.168.1.x IPs, and Office #2's router is handing out 192.168.2.x IPs, you're good to go.

networking,3an5pu,fisharr,5,Wed Jun 24 18:57:37 2015 UTC,"For any VPN you want two levels of security:   a certificate for each client, which can be revoked. This doesn't get you in, it merely allows the session to begin. The point here is to stop bad people connecting to your VPN and then brute-forcing userids & passwords. authentication against userid and password|token. This has to link back into the corporate directory. This is is the step where people who'd had their access terminated fail to login.   Edit: as an alternative to AnyConnect have a look at one of the products which adds a web skin to OpenVPN. Sophos have a commercial one, there are plenty of others. The nice things about this approach:   there's a host of client options, as any client which will work with OpenVPN will work, but at the same time you're not asking users of the more popular platforms to do arcane things. you can run it an VM and thus scale CPU and networking to meet the needs of the service. Congested VPNs are a major drama with the hardware-based VPN servers.   Finally I'd note that a lof of what a VPN does can also be acheived by application-layer PKI. That can be desirable for some systems: you're only asking people to install a certificate into their browser; and it's more resilient to networking issues."

networking,3anxsz,Dr__Dreidel,3,Mon Jun 22 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"More than likely, your device is already registered to an account. Fortinet is more than willing to transfer the ownership, but generally require the go-ahead by the previous account holder. In the past, companies I've worked for who have resold devices have been contacted by Fortinet saying that so-and-so was trying to register the device, and if we wanted to allow the transfer. So it's very possible that if you contact them, they could work with you and reach out to the previous account owner.   In any case, registering the device isn't necessarily required. FortiGates have 2 'licenses' or support options:   1st is 'Forticare'. This is the warranty and update license.  2nd is 'Fortiguard'. This is what allows the box to access all of the UTM stuff - AV updates, IPS signatures, Web Ratings, etc.    Neither of these are necessary for the hardware to work. Without, you can still access all of the standard functions of the box - IPSec, SSLVPN, Dynamic Routing, Policies, etc. This should be enough to get your feet more than a bit wet. The UTM stuff is simply built into 'profiles' that you can create and customize, so you have some AV Profiles, some IPS profiles, etc, and can apply them to policies as you desire.   I ran a 200a - without any licenses - for about a year before I got into a company that made heavy use of them, and the at home time was more than enough to teach myself the system and how it works, so worst comes to worst, I still think you can learn a ton.   If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up here or PM - or consider checking out the official forums at https://forum.fortinet.com/Forums. It's really become a busy place over the last year.

networking,3aoybu,CerealSubwaySam,5,Mon Jun 22 09:00:00 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure of how HyperV handles replication to a DR-site but I've learned from my adventures in DR-replication that applications that can mirror themselves are much more robust than mirroring actual machines to a DR-site.  AD for example can mirror itself and will be quite easy to set up. Databases can be set up to do so also and Exchange should be quite easy also, depending on existing configuration.  As added benefit, you'd not need to fire up the DR-copy when the doodoo hits the fan at primary.  EDIT: L2-connectivity is often required between DR-site and primary which you would also be able to avoid by replicating applications instead. Networking approved answer now? :)"
networking,3aoybu,d00bianista,4,Mon Jun 22 11:12:50 2015 UTC,"The Hyper-V replication is actually pretty good. Microsoft is positioning to have you be able to replicate up into Azure to give you a low cost off-site environment, so there's been a lot of focus on making sure it's first rate.  That being said, you shouldn't be doing Hyper-V replication for Exchange, SQL, ADDS or DFS. It should be a last resort for applications that don't support it otherwise and needs to be tested extensively.  All those apps have built in redundancy options which you should explore at the application level. They also have mechanisms for redirecting traffic when one of the instances does fail (e.g. DFS can automatically redirect client file share traffic to the backup when the primary fails without you spoofing IP addresses or changing DNS). Especially for SQL Server and Exchange. There's a very good chance you'd hose your SQL/Exchange database in a failure scenario if you were trying to use Hyper-V replication."
networking,3aoybu,pmormr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:52:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips.  We're going to look at Exchange DAG and building a new DC at the secondary site.

We will look into better options with SQL server high availability.

networking,3aif1b,soucy,29,Sat Jun 20 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"As a public university we have have a lot of public IPv4 space (upwards of a few hundred thousand addresses) so we were able to escape using NAT entirely until maybe a year or two ago.    The thing that pushed us to NAT for a small subset of networks was wireless coverage and the amount of devices that people have with them today.  Unfortunately doing NAT at this scale is incredibly expensive in terms of not only hardware but the logging requirements for incident response.  We host CDN servers for Akamai, Google, and Netflix in our data centers which combined save us over 10G of commercial bandwidth at peak times.  All of these CDN services are IPv6 enabled at this point, so by delivering IPv6 to clients we're able to avoid what amounts to the majority of traffic going through NAT.  Unfortunately, while we have the network ready for full IPv6 deployment and have been running native IPv6 as a production service for a decade or so there is one important piece that continues to hold us back:  IPAM.  Our current IPAM solution is actually really solid and has a design that I haven’t seen a commercial solution be able to come close to replicating.  That solution is one that has been developed in-house since the mid-90s, though, and we haven’t been able to convince people to make development of IPv6 functionality a priority.  Currently, the system handles DNS and static IPv6 assignment well, so things like servers are easy.  We even support DHCPv6-PD no problem.  The part that’s missing is dynamic address allocation.    The system uses a model where only registered clients receive an address.  For IPv4, the system handles clients that don’t receive a static (e.g. the majority of end-user devices) assignment through a process called network roaming.  Network roaming is pretty much open pool allocation but with controls in place to keep DNS records up to date as roaming events occur and security controls to control which networks a system is permitted to roam into.  We depend on this as a basic NAC mainly because 802.1X is challenging to implement when you don’t control the clients (e.g. an academic setting).  So our IPAM is 90% complete save the most important feature in terms of IPv6.  We looked at Infoblox as an alternative but it had no way to actually replicate the level of control we need, and for the scale we operate at the price tag was seven figures.  Nope.  At this point you’re probably wondering why we don’t just use SLAAC.  First, our users aren’t out of luck.  Even though we don’t hand out dynamic IPv6 by default, any user can request to have IPv6 and get a static assignment through DHCPv6.    In this respect DHCPv6 in a model of only responding to known clients has allowed us to enable IPv6 on nearly every network (hundreds of them) along-side IPv4 because we don’t need to worry about hosts that aren’t ready for IPv6 picking up an address.  It fundamentally shifts the model from IPv6 being enable on a per-network to a per-host basis and makes IPv6 rollout a non-service-affecting change.  I can say with certainty the if we allowed SLAAC then the problem of ever host picking up an IPv6 address regardless of whether it was ready for one or not would have been a show stopper and prevented deployment.  A lot of people who advocate IPv6 really want to restore the end-to-end model and are in a rush to do so.  They see SLAAC as the fastest way to get there and take the SLAAC vs DHCPv6 discussion into the territory of a religious debate.    For us it’s a matter of pragmatism and experience.  As a university that doesn’t use NAT we’ve been actually living the end-to-end model for IPv4 for a long time.  Over the past decade the security concerns have grown dramatically in the IPv4 world and I don’t think a lot of people pushing for open IPv6 understand what it takes to run a large network where you don’t filter traffic to the host because they’ve been living with NAT for so long.  The ones who have adopted a SLAAC model will tell you everything is fine, but that’s only because IPv6 is relatively ignored right now in terms of malicious traffic (brute force attempts or denial of service attacks).  This is because the lack of access to IPv6 has made IPv6 a kind of walled garden, but that is quickly changing as adoption ramps up, especially with residential service starting to provide native IPv6.  There is a security storm coming, and if you run IPv6 without filtering you need to be ready for that.  The long and short of it is that in our case we feel that SLAAC is just not something we can run for our environment.    A lot of this comes down to being able to know who had what address at what time for incident response, but because we don’t block incoming traffic to hosts on our network we maintain a number of systems to identify and contain compromised host systems to protect not only the user, but their peers.  We depend on security scanning and network flow analysis to identify problems, and that a host will have a predictable address to mitigate them.    Through years of running the end-to-end model for IPv4 we’ve built up a lot of custom  systems to keep things running smoothly and avoid being forced to lock down and filter our users, so that experience is what drives our decision to not implement IPv6 using SLAAC.  We could write new systems for IPv6, or we could deploy IPv6 using a model that is operationally consistent with how we deliver IPv4.  Given that we will be dual-stack for a very long time, there really isn’t a choice here.  There are no good commercial solutions to do what we need for IPv6 on the security side of things if SLAAC is the model; and taking on development of completely new systems instead of updating existing ones as well as the cost of training hundreds of IT staff on how to troubleshoot IPv6 in a way that is completely different from IPv4 would basically result in us saying we can’t afford to roll out IPv6 at all.  Anyway, the real point here is that if you deploy IPv6 you should hold it to the same standards you have for IPv4 in all areas (security, performance, and service availability).  If you don’t have a way to do that, then you’re not ready for IPv6 and you risk a failed deployment making your organization resistant to IPv6 adoption."
networking,3aif1b,fiberplz,5,Sat Jun 20 19:31:59 2015 UTC,"Great read. I work in the same space but we have NOT adopted IPV6 at this time. We do not host any IPV6 content and I do not feel like the knowledge level is strong enough to even want to begin supporting it. There is very little reward and a great deal of risk by engaging in IPV6, even at this time.  I will say though that we filter 100% of traffic that ingresses campus.. I couldn't imagine having that wide open."
networking,3aif1b,kombiwombi,3,Sat Jun 20 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"Conversely I assist a lot of universities with their networking and one of the huge benefits of IPv6 has been SLAAC and its removal of centralised IP address space management.  Since most casual users are on wireless, 802.1x is pretty widely used and supported by the BYOD devices. I helped with the national  deployment an extension of 802.1x which allows a member of one university to use the wireless network at another university (""eduroam""). That's been a success and gives identification of endusers.  Note that using globally-routable IP addresses doesn't imply a lack of filtering. Deep packet inspection is still possible and worthwhile. Furthermore SLAAC addresses are stable enough for blocking of threats to be just as effective as with IPv4.  Edit: going back to the OP's question. IPv6 has three bugbears:   equipment. Many IT departments haven't had a ""must"" requirement for IPv6 support in equipment they have purchased in the past decade. If your department is one of these then you may be the person who pays the piper for this shortsightedness. accounting. Some IT departments bill traffic to charge codes. IPv6 means that this systems needs augmentation, upgrading, replacement. Sometimes those systems are the result of 15 years of work, and the augmentation then raises questions about the ongoing desirability of that system. The differing textual format of IPv6 is particularly egarious, as pretty much every home-built systems which manipulates IP addresses will need work. For some departments this is a showstopper, for other departments it is a non-issue. firewalls. That mess of firewall rules -- you're going to need to sort that out so that you can write a parallel policy for IPv6.   The point I'd make is that these are just bugbears. Mostly IPv6 ""just works"". The less ""internet"" and more ""enterprise"" the application the less the odds of that (the development of 'enterprise computing' into an irrelevant ghetto is something I've written about elsewhere, this is yet another example)."
networking,3aif1b,soucy,5,Sat Jun 20 22:47:47 2015 UTC,802.1X is definitely something that makes using SLAAC more acceptable but hard to do if you don't control the clients.  It seems like someone is always excluded if you require it.  Even with an on-boarding application solution to make the process simpler (which should be offensive to users but they're mostly clueless and will click anything) you still have the problem of IPv6 privacy extensions and temporary addressing breaking the one-host one-address model that existing network security designs depend upon.  You can go with something like Cisco Trustsec if you're willing to accept vendor lock-in and use Cisco for everything from wireless to firewalls but for most people that's a showstopper.  SLAAC is great as a bootstrap for link-local or keeping residential IPv6 simple but it was never intended to replace stateful address assignment for a managed network.    In my view a big problem is that people were so eager to push people to adopt IPv6 that they advised SLAAC for all situations because DHCPv6 isn't easy and there aren't many solutions for it out there yet.  Unfortunately while thinking they were advancing the cause of adoption they were actually holding it back by taking attention away from the lack of DHCPv6 support as a problem.  As a result it took years to get clients to have solid DHCPv6 implementations and we're still struggling in the case of Android.  There is also the lack of a good IPAM solution which is a major roadblock to adoption.  As I mentioned a lot of early adopters embraced SLAAC for its simplicity and have been mostly OK because security for IPv6 has been largely ignored and DHCPv6 clients only became common in the past few years.  Many of my peers in higher education have started coming to me asking how to deal with increasing security incidents over IPv6 in the past year.    Some have gone as far as to try polling router neighbor discovery tables to log MAC to IPv6 associations only to find that its so CPU intensive at large scale that they can't justify it and end up going further down the rabbit hole trying to write passive scanners that try to gleam the traffic from a tap or SPAN port only to find that the logging requirements become overwhelming and a significant development time and hardware investment to keep them in a responsive and searchable format (e.g. database).  For the most part they're stuck in a position where they rolled out something without taking management and security into consideration and now they can't take it away from people.  Not a good place to be.
networking,3aif1b,kombiwombi,0,Sun Jun 21 10:18:18 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that stateless autconfiguration was acceptable to enterprises for Novell IPX and AppleTalk. So I have the feeling that somewhere along the line we lost out way a little and bought into expensive systems to manage every single IP address.  As for 802.1x the trick is to support both TTLS+PAP and PEAP+MSCHAPv2 at the authenticating server. Then you can use the native client on the platform. Totally agreed that the onboarding is still a drama, because on most platforms you're asking users to go and set parameters they don't understand.  I understand what you are trying to do and in your case I'd bridge all the Neighbour Discovery packets on each subnet into a tunnel back to a Linux box. That will get you the IPv6 Address--MAC address mappings as machines come online and do Duplicate Address Detection."
networking,3aif1b,nightkhaos,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:08:43 2015 UTC,"Actually DHCP came before AppleTalk and IPX had problems of scalability, so I think that comparing them to SLAAC is not equivalent.  And also, I might as well point this out, the RFC for SLAAC specifically states (RFC4862):   The stateless approach is used when a site is not particularly concerned with the exact addresses hosts use, so long as they are unique and properly routable.  On the other hand, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] is used when a site requires tighter control over exact address assignments. Both stateless address autoconfiguration and DHCPv6 may be used simultaneously.   It seems that the people who originally suggested SLAAC understood that it was ill suited for well controlled networks. Just because we can audit SLAAC traffic doesn't mean we should use it over DHCPv6. Having a clear audit trail like DHCPv6 provides makes things easier from a tooling perspective. It also allows us to more easily identify rogue traffic.  This isn't to say DHCPv6 is the best way to do secure a networking and prevent rogue traffic, it is just a well known way, and it is a way that requires very little shift from the current and historic approaches. I mean the only thing that most people will need to get out of their heads is ""one IP per device"" to provide adequate service. This is compared to ""non centralized managed auto configured addresses"" which will scare the crap out some people. I mean come on, we're already taking away their precious NAT. :P  Some interesting approaches have come out to this problem like CGAs, and while CGAs themselves (due to the use of SHA1) should probably be depreciated, the concepts definitely need some exploring.  However, right now, for sanity reasons, most of the time you're better off deploying DHCPv6 for managed networks."

It ended up being a DHCP issue - he didn't have an IPv4 address, just v6.  It's important to remember that a dual-stack network is actually two separate layer 3 networks running at the same time over the same hardware. It's totally possible for only one of them to have a problem, and this leads to failure modes that aren't quite the same as a single-stack network.

But more on that in a moment.  First let me point out I haven't actually done an enterprise IPv6 deployment yet, merely been involved in feasibility studies and experimented with it at home (however my ""home network"" has a lot of room for experimentation, more on that in a moment).  While I would really like to deploy at work we haven't yet due to a difference of opinion with the senior Network Administrator that I haven't had the time, nor motivation, to actually flesh out with him in detail. The difference of opinion comes down to two key areas: our firewall software not supporting BGP for IPv6 and where we should deploy first.  My opinion is you want to deploy to your users first as ultimately you need somewhere to test your IPv6 service endpoints. This means you need to deploy two networks, your desktop network and your wireless network. To do this we don't require BGP enabled on IPv6.  The second place you want to deploy is endpoints. Provide an IPv6 endpoint for existing systems. This will have to be done on a case by case basis, and as a lot of our production systems are externally hosted again we don't need BGP, and for the ones that do need BGP, well the endpoint will fall back to IPv4 while we're migrating data centers anyway, so there is no practical reason why we can't get our provider to announce for us until such time as a firewall BGP support has been fixed by the vendor (or we take my advice on the very unpopular opinion of moving to a new firewall appliance...).  Then you can finally focus on the backend network(s). You will want to focus on new systems here, and ideally IPv6 only with NAT64 for legacy access (however you may need to go Dual Stack with some products that don't work well under an IPv6 only implementation, YMMV, I did most of my experimentation with open source products where IPv6 compatibility is relatively strong).  All this looks like a relatively painless process, and I won't get into further details like using DHCP as it has been support for security tools and auditing as they have already been covered.  However I do have one bugbear. Your wireless network will have to be assisted or SLAAC only because for some unfathomable reason Andriod doesn't, and won't, support DHCPv6. They use the excuse of tethering for not updating to a version of the daemon that supports DHCPv6, despite the fact that tethering doesn't apply on WiFi connections.  This isn't a problem at home as my security consists only of a stateful firewall and I have no auditing at all, however at work this might mean we either have to acknowledge we can't audit WiFi traffic, or just say sorry to Android users, you don't get IPv6. Both of which I am not happy with."
networking,3aif1b,soucy,3,Sat Jun 20 23:10:46 2015 UTC,Our solution is to just not provide Android IPv6 until it has a full implementation (e.g. DHCPv6 support).  Sucks for Android users but my iPhone works great.  IPv6 isn't required yet and phones are a secondary priority on our network.  We can get by with providing them NATed IPv4 for a long time.
networking,3aif1b,nightkhaos,2,Sun Jun 21 04:44:40 2015 UTC,"That works for you I'm sure, however considering our company does mobile development as one of its many functions we unfortunately cannot take that stance.  Another consideration was to make a secondary WiFi network that was IPv6 only with NAT64 for testing. Apple's new policy regarding iOS 9 has made this pretty much mandatory for us now.  I really wish more people, such as yourself, would kick up a stink about Android not supporting DHCPv6 so they actually fix it.

Google will be forced to come on board eventually as everyone else already has and once enough DHCPv6 networks are out there they won't really be able to fight the issue.    It's fairly well known that the entire issue is actually one person drawing a line in the sand.  Lorenzo Colitti has done some great work promoting IPv6 adoption but he's just wrong on this one (he's one of these people who believes DHCPv6 shouldn't exist despite it already being widely implemented and adopted).

I'm affraid there's no right way to do it, and there are many issues on most of the network gear I've had to use.  The worst issue I've been dealing with is MLD snooping. No switch is able to manage enough groups for a large L2 deployment, so we have to switch at least the IPv6 support to a routed design, or deal with so much broadcast it messes up most control planes.  Routing IPv6 up to the access port is nice, but then comes dual-stack. IPv4 is a whole other issue : if you're routing it to the access port you'll end up with DHCP snooping and proxying everywhere, and that's also a pain for most control planes.  In the end I've had to push for a single stack routed IPv6 design, with NAT64/DNS64 for legacy services and tunneling IPv4 to some reluctant hosts.  It works, but project management is a real mess in such cases because there's always a service everyone rely on but is not managed anymore and run off a forgotten unmaintained server in some closet far from the standard IT process.  On the last one we spent 2 months chasing such unofficial servers, with employees using / running them playing hide and seek to keep their private garden off our migration plan. Some of them beeing creative enough to force us into trafic dumping and cable relabelling to hunt down the last two offenders.  I also second the IPAM consideration. I found no useable solution on the shelf, we always had to improvise with in-house code. And it always fucks things up with Active Directory. That damn AD is what pisses me off everytime I have to work on a LAN project : I couldn't figure how to make it play ball on an IPv6 network."

IPv6 has been deployed internally for over 4 years now. The longer ""testing"" period you have to perfect and test your deployment the better. What you don't want is to get caught off guard when something does become v6 only and you can't access it and then scrabble to get something together.  Design wasn't particularly challenging. Already had a fully routed v4 network, and all equipment is on a strict 3-5 year replacement cycle, so all hardware at this point is fully v6 capable. Did the standard dual-stack deployment and has worked well so far. Security didn't require a whole lot of changes to start with. Deny all inbound non-established and permit all outbound and go from there. Been using public addressing internally forever so used to securing networks using global addressing internally. Certainly monitoring tools had to be updated to support v6, that was probably the biggest headache and still isn't 100%."

If you're willing to move anywhere just get on indeed.com, search ""Network Engineer"" and spam your resume to places that interest you.  I personally avoided the big DOD contractors like the plague. I am still in the air national guard to maintain my clearance just in case I need a job in a pinch since DOD contract work is pretty much guaranteed if you're willing to move, have Sec+/CCNA/CCNP and are cleared.  I hated working for the military. I had a great enlistment, got BTZ/Step-Promoted and won all kinds of stupid awards. It kick-started my networking career so I don't regret it, but it was the worst job I ever had... and I worked at taco bell as a line cook for 4 years. I hated it not because of any moral obligations, but the IT manning/organization structure was very unhealthy. In military IT you just work with a bunch of incompetent turds who stay in because they're not skilled enough to make it on the outside. If they weren't horrible engineers they would never stay in. In the networking field you can easily double or triple your salary on the outside and reduce your risk of going to the desert to 0%. Why would anyone stay in unless they weren't too bright? Okay... I'm done shitting on military IT now. Apologies, it's just one of my favourite hobbies and I'm quite passionate about it.   That being said, if your goal is to get into a DOD contracting position your best bet is to get in contact with various recruiting agencies and recruiters around the country. I have my resume on clearencejobs and I get calles/e-mails weekly offering some engineer position in military-dense areas offering a great salary and awesome benefits. If you're not on clearencejobs get there. Also, lie on your profile and say you're readily available to be employed and are willing to locate. If you don't have that on your profile you won't get near many calls. Even if you don't want the job it'll help you get in contact with a bunch of recruiters who have other opportunities. I have phone/email for roughly 10 recruiters who constantly e-mail me with openings. If you're going to be actively looking in the next few months PM me and I will send you their contact information.  Some companies get back to you in just a few days, some take up to a couple of months. That is why I recommend recruiters! They will respond immediately and go to bat for you. It makes the job-search process a lot less annoying because you don't have to bear around the bush about the job and salary expectations and all that. The recruiter will tell you up front ""We need 4 engineers within the next 2 months. The position pays 120k/year. If you have Sec+, Clearance and CCNA I can get you an interview next week."" which is great. You've got to make sure they don't try and put you into a role you aren't really qualified for because they are comission-hungry fuckers, but all in all the system works nicely if you know what you want."

networking,3ahmb4,the-packet-thrower,2,Mon Jun 22 04:13:45 2015 UTC,"Starting from the beginning  In college I interned at a multidisciplinary engineering firm, and I worked in the electrical engineering department. I was producing specifications reviewing plans and helping with copying a lot of papers. This all predates sending plans and specs via PDF. This eventually led to working on a large project and becoming a network administrator on an already deployed Cisco network and HP server/Windows network.  This was great experience. At the time there were few other places where green field Cisco voice existed.  We did it all. So think of it as fireman. Benefits here were great autonomy, easy to get involved in all the work you wanted and also very little call responsibility. The bad things were that it had about 0 chance for upward mobility. The salary wasn't great and they had no issues working you hard without any thanks.   I moved into the world of EPC after. EPC is engineering, procurement, and construction for those unfamiliar.  This is a high pressure low bid low cost type of environment. Jobs are reluctant to spend any money on any technology. Circuits must be fought for. You had to justify every dollar because the project managers personally were losing money when they agreed to spend money on IT. Their compensation structures ran completely opposite of the goals of IT. Sound infrastructure on the project side was overlooked. We were pushed to use products we never tested since it was cheaper.   I just remembered a valid point.  In neither of the examples above was there ever money or labs to test or certify any of these solutions. Changes were done with little pre-test or dev environments.  Even CUCM upgrades just happened on a hope and prayer. The way management tolerated this was by always hiring a partner to theoretically be there and accept blame. The partners we have worked with are woefully unprepared and incapable of producing results on very complex topologies or new technologies that we were literally the first customer they had seen. Partial thing I learned here is to engage partners only based on their documented experience doing exactly what you are. Else you have a liability on your hands because they will be learning how to do this on your project and on your budget.    Back to EPC. The money is here. They pay much better since you are critical to the success of their projects. Without you they cannot make money. This is a recurring theme.  The advice here is to always remain close to how a company makes money. EPC builds things. Plants, processes, oil, gas, chemical, etc... Those are done with networks and automation systems.  We supplied the parts to make them successful so we have value. Engineering you aren't as valuable since you are usually (in electrical) around 10% of the whole design or less.   I moved to working in healthcare.  This is a complete cluster.  You have an amazing dog and pony show that happens.  Doctors and buildings are no expense spared operations.  Concrete and steel will be paid for without question.  If you need to replace the ancient 4500 in the closet with one sup and no smart net and no POE go pound sand.  It still works so we ride this thing till it dies.  You want to deploy a 90% virtualized network and upgrade your datacenter to support it and all you had at the time was sup720 6500s with inadequate ports and cards.  You need money to upgrade that and buy the SAN. Imagine fighting tooth and nail for this.  Literally you have to convince them to buy something and re sell this every day.  High call requirements.  With 0 tolerance for missed calls. You are still a fireman here. You need to be able to do it all (AD, VPN, exchange, content filter/email, IDS/IPS, wireless, design, etc). There is still no money for lab. No certification process.   Salary was about on par with EPC. Neither cares about certs. They will pay for passes. Won't pay a dime for IE attempts or additional training.   Lastly I work for a vendor now. 100% win. Salary is nice. We certify in the lab before we recommend.  We think about things in a very different very structured manner. They demand the best and the talent you are surrounded by is immense. People occasionally have attitudes about how awesome they think of themselves.  Internal siloed technologies are hard to cross. Building relationships between yourself and others is critical. It is something I learned quickly. I was told very early on my knowledge was deep enough to work just about anywhere. I just needed to improve my soft skills and people skills. This is something that far too many people fail to understand in our arena. People assume their certifications equate to dollars or their title. It very often has nothing to do with that. It had far more to do with how you get along with people and your ability to motivate people to help you to get a task done on time. It sounds a little cheerleader to say that but it's the God honest truth.    Advice TL:DR - work for the company that you are the product. Pay is better and your treatment is better.  The further away you are from being the product the easier you are overlooked and your value is marginalized.  Work your people skills. Get uncomfortable.  When things are uncomfortable you are learning."

networking,3ahmb4,tgwill,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"Here's a quick overview of what I've experienced personally so far...  Consulting/VAR/MSP  As a consultant in a decent-sized firm, it's much like a normal company of the same size, except you get a decent amount of project variation by working with different clients.  You do design, config, install, equipment acquisition, whatever it takes to get the job done.  As a senior consultant and/or owning the firm, you have the added pressure of bringing in new clients, managing the business, etc.  Consulting can be very rewarding in terms of seeing projects through from design to completion and the impact you have.  Consulting can be difficult in terms of managing client relationships.  Compensation is directly tied to the work you do and the business you bring in; might be very high or relatively low.  Upward mobility depends on the size of the firm; a large firm has the most opportunity, but it depends entirely on relationships and client development.  Enterprise  You're a cog in the machine, doing what needs to be done.  At a junior level, work may be very siloed.  Plenty of opportunities to be hands-on, but what that means varies significantly role to role (rack & stack vs. config, etc).  A a senior level, you may get to make more decisions and potentially have creative authority, but everything is design-by-committee, so politics and relationships are pervasive.  Compensation is very stable/secure at a reasonably mid-level (not dependent on bringing in client business, etc), but it's also seen as a cost-center so bonuses and raises may be harder to justify.  Upward mobility varies a lot on the org, but this is probably the best space for it -- lots of enterprises allow for progression in parallel tracks for ICs and management, so you may not need to become nontechnical to move up.  Can be easy to get stuck in a rut if you aren't careful -- you've got to be very proactive about managing your career and keeping yourself moving in the direction you want (technical skills, projects, etc).  K-12  My experience was in the context of a public charter school operated by a nonprofit org, so YMMV depending on the exact context.  I was a one-stop shop for a new school -- architect, CTO, engineer, equipment acquisitions, compliance, sysadmin, etc (but not helpdesk -- faculty and staff took care of that).  Lots and lots of fun in terms of taking something end to end and one of the highlights of my career so far.  No room for career growth; long-term, that role was going to stagnant into keeping the lights on, handling periodic upgrades, troubleshooting issues, etc.  Compensation is stable but low; bonuses and raises are nonexistent.  Public Universities  Similar to my K12 experience, except way more political issues.  Constant shifting of project priorities, fires to fight, lots of legacy decision debt, etc.  Pretty similar to enterprise, in retrospect -- but lower compensation and no bonuses/raises.  Upward mobility is very slow and quickly involves stepping into management (no real mobility as a technical IC).  Nonprofits  They don't hire networking staff, generally speaking.  The opportunities I've had to work for/with nonprofits have been volunteering, consulting, and in my role as a member of the boards of directors.  It's similar to the K12 experience -- very fulfilling to help an org that (often times) has a really terrible technology infrastructure identify and improve in ways that have very significant impacts on their business and their ability to serve their community.  The biggest tricks are thinking about how to make their infrastructure totally lights-off and sustainable without needing highly skilled folks around all the time, and also how to do enterprise-level functionality on a shoestring budget.  Personally, I take it as a challenge -- it's fun to figure out how to get stuff like 1g and 10g infrastructure into a nonprofit for next-to-no-money compared to the solutions you might see at a normal business.  No compensation unless you're a consultant/vendor (and then it's usually less than what you can get from other types of clients).  Event Services  Designing and delivering networks for one-time events is a ton of fun, but a lot of work.  The same end-to-end satisfaction as a few other roles.  Lots of client management and relationship development.  Clients never know what they want, so you have to ask a lot of very nuanced questions proactively.  Events often think of things like networking, power, and furniture as after thoughts compared to agendas, food, sponsorship, logistics, etc -- if you're not careful, this can result in things like rolling brownouts from inadequate power provisioning, an event organizer allowing 20% more attendees into a space than what you planned to support, etc.  Compensation varies -- events always want a deal and have no idea how much a network costs; they often compare to Best Buy pricing (there's a lot of education that has to happen during the relationship).  Upward mobility depends on context -- recurring events have a tendency to develop leadership legacies with the same folks coming back to do it every time, and the network side is usually pretty flat.  Startups  Fantastic if you've got one that's fully funded and leadership that has at least an awareness of the costs and complexities involved.  Nightmare if you've got one that's yet-to-be-funded and/or management that considers networks to be an afterthought.  Also can be very challenging to help a startup scale from a home-grown solution to a proper business-ready infrastructure if you're coming late to the game after the founders already have something strung together.  If it's not funded yet, never take equity as compensation unless they're paying you well in addition to that.  No upward mobility.  Small Businesses  Like the K12 and Nonprofits -- often a one-stop for infrastructure, but you might have to do helpdesk as well.  Compensation is poor, bonuses/raises nonexistent (you're seen as a cost center).  No upward mobility.  Overtime  Depends entirely on the org and role.  You may be required to be part of an on-call rotation in some roles, rotating-hours staff shifts may be a requirement in other roles.  Some roles are hourly, some are salaried.  Salaried roles often give you the ability to manage your schedule, so you may be <40 hours some weeks and >40 other weeks -- in that case, you also generally get enough rope to hang yourself, in the sense that if you keep saying ""yes"" to new projects and commitments you may quickly find yourself overwhelmed and working a lot of unpaid overtime.  Salaried roles generally do not pay overtime; hourly roles may pay 1.5x for each hour past 8 hours in a single day and/or each hour past 40 hours in a week."
networking,3ahmb4,drakontas,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"I have spent most of my networking career working in the SP space for a small regional provider. The good thing about this job is you get to touch a lot of different technologies. The bad things are you are held to really high standards when it comes to performance, availability, and mean time to repair.   The fun stuff is you are always designing a new network for a customer or augmenting your current network to handle growth. One thing you have to be aware of is costs are heavily scrutinized. You better be able to justify why you are doing something because management is going to ask. This also includes your salary, getting raises can be tough. On the fun side though you are touching some of the newest and best technology on the market right now and you are expected to be learning this technology as well.  When it comes to performance, availability and mean time to repair this can get very tedious at times. We have customers call in trouble tickets on circuits that drop 5 packets over a 20 minute window. This circuit goes through our network, but it also might go through 2 other companies' networks so you aren't sure if the drops are on your side or not at first. It now becomes your job to find out where they are being dropped and fix it. The entire time you are on a stop watch because how quickly this gets fixed directly impacts your mean time to repair statistics. It's not unusual to be on a conference call for 2-3 hours while all parties involved try and figure out where the problem is located. In the worst case scenarios you might have to prove to another provider that they are the one causing the issue. This means sending techs out to meet-me locations with test sets to isolate the different networks until you find the one causing the issue.  All in all the Service Provider environment is fun and engaging and I really have liked it a lot. IMO it is the fastest way to grow your knowledge and understanding of networking especially working for a smaller shop where you will be asked to fill multiple roles."
networking,3ahmb4,Jackol1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"I've only done networking at an MSP so far, so I can't really compare it to anything else.  But what I do like is that I get so many different situations and problems to solve.  Client A's needs may not be anything like Client B's thus requiring a brand new solution, but Client C could benefit heavily from what I learned working on Client A.    Not everything I do is fully related to networking, and that's always a nice break too.    Some of our clients are cheap and I have to come up with something simple so that when they do shoot themselves in the foot, it ain't our fault.  Some of our clients are rolling in dough and have no issues paying us what we need to get them the best set up.  Developing shoe-string solutions and super well-funded solutions provide their own unique challenges and both can be quite a bit of fun.   Also, there are two huge feel-good things about it:   I really love the feeling of having a fleet of networks out there that I designed.  Sounds selfish I know, but hey man, I love making things. When someone comes to us with a broken network, or new issues have developed based on their changing needs (that they invariably never tell us about until it is too late), being able to come up with a solution, drop it in, and then hear that things are working fantastically..  such a good feeling."
networking,3ahmb4,sugardeath,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"I worked for an ISP in the early-to-mid 90s. People wore a lot of different hats: designing and expanding networks one minute then addressing systems security another. The pay was okay, but not great with relation to the work load. We put in a lot of hours because of the 24/7 nature of customer issues.  I moved to a VAR in 1995, mostly focused on Novell Netware builds for large school districts. Understanding networking certainly helped with migration and integration work, especially when interfacing Netware/IP with existing UNIX networks, as well as when companies required Internet connectivity. Never a dull moment with this job, always learning something new in order to address a build concern, since every installation site worked differently. The down side came from never fully investing in a system, building to a specification even when you disagreed with the design. I identified problems and provided solutions when possible, but usually not called in to implement changes. Sales commissions padded a low salary, and overall compensation worked out well, though inconsistent. Since work generally did not tie to operations, hours did not usually extend into evenings nor weekends. Though, some installations required weekend work.  In 2000, I went to work for a growing national bank. Their growth through acquisition complicated networking, because of logical addressing conflicts, routing strategies and capital expenditure differences. Initially, I enjoyed the work, integrating networks and introducing VoIP. However, after a couple years, most problems got addressed through following a well-planned group of recipes. That bank viewed technology as an expensive liability, so pay and pay raises stayed extremely low compared to the rest of the company; aside from my negotiated starting salary. I could not complain with the hours, thinking I worked fewer than ten weekends over the five years I spent there. The biggest down side came from the slow-moving nature of banking, where small changes required months of planning meetings.  In 2006, I moved to a start up, and back to multi-discipline work: heavy Linux engineering, application delivery and building data centers. We did not get paid well, mostly counting on the company going public and converting our stock and options into wealth. I learned a lot at this job, where people had very little time to solve huge, complex problems. The operations group grew quickly and I finally decided to leave after eighteen months: small salary, little hope of IPO and zero time off.  For the past eight years, I have worked for an animation company. Nothing stays on the network longer than three years, as we constantly replace components with faster systems. From each vendor, core gear usually means their biggest, baddest, fastest. The biggest challenge at work comes from analyzing network and systems metrics in order to tune both for higher productivity. I get paid fair market rate and get to work with the latest technology, at times working with storage, systems and network equipment not yet on the market, through strategic partners. Alpha and beta testing equipment within a high-utilization, 24/7 system means we must account for software bugs and hardware failure. The work load does not rival working at a start up because the teams have an appropriate number of engineers, but times exist when a smaller group must deal with difficult issues, usually centered around software/service review or application delivery. I work a considerable amount of hours, averaging 63 hours per week."

networking,3afb7d,robi2106,3,Sat Jun 20 01:35:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for asking!  Like I said, of the three authors I consumed in the last two weeks, INE's were the best. It's obvious you guys take production quality seriously. Of the items I listed in the original post, the only things that might really apply to you are:   The toolbar in your whiteboarding app should be hidden away if you're not actively using it. If it has some kind of autohide feature where it appears your mouse hits the top of the screen, that'd be great. If you've got some way of using keyboard shortcuts instead, that'd be even better.  Captions for what the presenter is saying would be helpful. The presenter (for the videos I was watching, regarding STP) was engaging, but it's inevitable that I'll be distracted for a moment, or have some incidental environment noise, (and my hearing isolation isn't that great, anyway) and captions are good ways to help me catch what I missed.   Of stuff that isn't on the list, it's pretty minor stuff. A slightly heavier font weight on the whiteboard is probably the biggest thing. Limiting color choices to something that contrasts strongly with the whiteboard (pretty much: stay away from yellow.) would be smart, too.  One thing I recall done very well was that even though I couldn't always read what was on a given console window on the screen, the presenter covered for that by saying out loud what I would have needed to see there. That redundancy is the kind of thing I'm talking about when I say to strive to push information across multiple channels (Voice, video, text).  Keep in mind it's been over a week since I watched the videos, so if I'm misremembering something, I apologize."

networking,3afb7d,EtherealMind2,4,Fri Jun 19 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"yeah normalization is hard subject, since ""loudness"" is defined differently.  Some broadcast specs suggest normalizing speech to -6dB, music to -10dB.  But if you don't have an audio program that uses those numbers or that scale then you are SOL guessing what ""goes up to 11"" means.  If nothing else, make sure all your productions are consistent between tracks, and for pete's sake (I'm sure someone watching  / listening is named Pete) .. make your intro music quieter.  Nothing is as annoying as having that loud stock music stinger blare and then having to crank up the volume once the people start talking.  Hence, normalize music to -10 and speech to -6."

Like when they say words with strong Ss or Fs, it almost sounds like it's clipping or something. It's definitely uncomfortable. When you compare it to one of the TWiT podcasts, the difference is night and day. I think it's some combination of mic, compression, eq settings. iOS podcast app doesn't have an equalizer so there's nothing I can do on my end, and TWiT podcasts sound perfect so I feel like I shouldn't have to fix it on my side anyway."

So far I'm also liking their interface a lot more.  Oh yeah, and the quote for matching appliances, plus a block of professional services for install and customizations, came out to half the price."
networking,3afp44,nouc2,29,Fri Jun 19 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"So basically the way this works, the provider will give you a T-1 line which comes in on a RJ-45/48/etc jack which will basically look like a regular type of 8 pin jack in a patch panel that you will plug a network cord in to. This handoff will generally happen in the MPOE, which is also known as a demarc, because it is the demarcation of the handoff of responsibility from the carrier to you. The carrier's job is to deliver a working signal to the demarc. After that it's your problem. That means if you need the T-1 to be in your server room, someone has to run an extension to your server room from the MPOE (this is also called an extended demarc)  Once you have the T-1 where you need it, you will need to connect it to a CSU/DSU to understand the T-1 signaling. In the olden days when dinosaurs walked the earth, there were external CSU/DSUs that then hooked to a router with a serial cable (usually giant serial cables, with a head called a winchester block). These days you can get a cheap router with a built in CSU/DSU (or buy a modular router and a CSU/DSU). You can buy a used Cisco 17xx series router on eBay for like 40 bucks that will do the job just fine. There's a million other new/used options depending on your budget. This is extremely old technology.  After you get your router with a T-1 CSU/DSU, you just need to plug the T-1 line into your router. T-1 uses pins 1,2,4,5. The other pins are not used. Assuming you connect a properly extended T-1 into a properly configured T-1 card, you should see port come up and see the alarm light on the device turn off.  After that it's a relatively simple matter of configuring the router. From the sounds of things, you have a /30 to the ISP and a /29 block of usable IPs. You would configure your serial port (the T-1 port) with the IP of the /30 that corresponds to your device and then add a default route to point to the IP of the carrier's side of the /30.  Then you would configure an IP of the /29 block on your router's Ethernet port to be your gateway, and use the other/rest/whatever of the IP addresses on your interface of your SonicWall, add a route on your SonicWall to point traffic out that interface to the IP of the router's Ethernet interface. Run an Ethernet cable from your router's Ethernet port to the Ethernet port on the SonicWall. Make sure you can ping your router, then try to ping your side of the /30, then the carrier's side of the /30, then ultimately try to ping stuff out on the Internet.  This is kind of a grossly under-written example and I have assumed a step or two in the process somewhere. I just figured it'd be more helpful than telling you to hire a network engineer.  That said you should probably hire a network engineer."

The /30 you mentioned elsewhere would be used between the carrier and the router on the T1 side. Then you'd use two IPs from the /29 between the router and your firewall on the Ethernet side.

SONET/SDH is on the way out being replaced by carrier ethernet and packet OTN switching. Take mobile backhaul as an example, the newest transport boxes will take PDH from the masts and use circuit emulation over a MPLS -TP transport network to aggregate to an OTN switched core.  As you said SDH i assume that you are based in europe or asia. I know of three major service providers who are currently migrating to this network model and a number are already employing it.  DWDM is also evolving with more RAMAN amplification being rolled out and more importantly flexible grid in both submarine and terrestrial coupled with L0 mesh restoring topologies.  Transport and SDH may seem to be uninteresting but it is a necessary part of the telecomms infrastructure and there will always be a demand for people with experience in the field.  Long story short - I work in transport and I dont think its dull or stagnated. You work for an ISP - you WILL be dealing with switching in the transport network - if not today then soon."

That's pretty excellent as we can use VLANs to build differing topologies without running around recabling.  Since this implies leaving the heavy lifting of networking to the RPis then the RPis will need multiple interfaces. I'd go out and buy a small number of USB/ethernet dongles. Not too many, because once your students are proficient enough they'll realise that multiple ports on the RPi can be implemented by running a VLAN trunk from the switch to each RPi.  So we have an adjustable topology, and a Debian platform with as many (VLAN) interfaces as we please. That's pretty much everything we need to teach any networking topic.  So what to teach   obviously starting simply, IP and IPv6 addressing. DHCP and SLAAC. Wireshark is good to see how these protocols actually work. You run the DHCP server on one of the RPis and project it's logs into the screen. whack a USB/ethernet dongle into a RPi and demonstrate subnetting and routing between subnets. Get students using ping and looking at the RPis ARP tables in some exercises designed to show the L2/L3 distinction. now set up a routable topology -- something with a chain of RPis connected in interesting ways (including some redundancy). Have an exercise where you statically route that --- the takehome lessons here are the complexity of static routing and its lack of response to topology change (ie, traffic dies when you unplug one fo the RPis despite a viable redundant route). Now install Quagga and repeat with OSPF. Let people run wireshark so they understand what is happening -- you'll need to help them buy displaying some of the OSPF packets on the screen and walking them through how the topoklogy change lead to that particular advertisment. back up a little and do the same with bridging. Exploring spanning tree. Ending with the realisation that your switch is really just a bridge with lots of ports. This is a good point to talk about hardware versus software, explaining TCAMs, showing the TCAM on the switch, etc. expand the network more to incorporate a upstream RPi acting as a BGP router. Get everyone to peer with that. Explore the difference between exterior and interior routing protocols, and why they are designed so very differently. Arc up OpenVSwitch. Run all the VLANs to that. Run up a small OpenFlow program to implement a switch, and then a router. Implement a typical SDN datacentre ""all hosts routed"" network. use Python to implement a small server. Explore sockets, and how they relate to actual on-the-wire traffic. Use a RPi with netem module to add latency , jitter and loss and explore TCP dynamics and performance."

You can assign the guest wlan to a virtual interface that has its physical configured for eth2.  One thing to watch out for is that you don't have any firewalling for your anchor WLC this way, so you want to create an ACL that drops all traffic destined for the ip configured on the external-facing interface.  As far as your 250+ host requirement, just configure the modem's internal address subnet mask to be a /23 or lower. You can then run DHCP on the anchor WLC for the guest network, and still be able to communicate with the modem (just make it the default gateway as part of the DHCP pool).

They might use a couple factors to TRY to determine if it's static or dynamic. This might include:  -Checking the IP Block / DNS name to determine if it's associated with a consumer ISP  -Checking the FQDN to see if the IP address is a part of the domain name (ISPs commonly do this for reverse-lookup as the FQDN isn't associated with a particular customer/account domain name).  -Some other ""made up"" method they've put together.

It's typically used to assign dynamic addresses, but it's easy to configure a DHCP server to always give a specific IP address to a certain client. (Many ISPs assign static IPs this way.) ""Dynamic IP address"" and ""autoconfigured IP address"" are not necessarily the same thing.  Second, what you said about TCP/IP doesn't make any sense.

A static IP is manually entered into the device. A sticky IP is received using DHCP.  This normally looks at the MAC address and assigns the same dynamic IP based off that.  This is why people have issues when they get a new device, because the MAC changes , thus the IP assigned is different. A Dynamic IP is more or less an IP assigned by a DHCP server."

Lets break it down by each switch and their strengths and i'll leave it up to you to define ""best"":  Procurve 1810G-24 : 24-port gigabit switch which is silent! perfect for home use since it makes no noise. Layer 2 only however. You cannot do IP routing or layer 3 vlan interfaces on it. run's the Procurve OS.  Procurve 2824 : Basic low power gigabit switch with basic Layer 3 ""lite"" features (usually static routing only). OK switch. Super simple interface running the procurve OS.  Procurve 3400CL : More featured L3 Gigabit switch with a couple of  10-gigabit-ethernet ports (depending on model). can do most L3 routing protocols like OSPF and BGP. Run's Procurve OS and to the dismay of many networking people, Procurve is still a widely used switch OS in the SME market. Also a little noisy.  Catalyst 3500 : Many of these are 10/100 with 2 optional gigabit ports. Has the full Layer 3 gamut running IOS making it an excellent switch to learn off of but not so great for using at home for your network if it is 10/100. Also a little noisy. If you are trying to learn IOS (which has the lead market share at around %45-%50) this is probably the switch to play around with."

It's not because your warehouse needs a 400,000 square feet room that every single office needs that much space. It would be very wasteful to build every single room to be 400,000 square feet if it was only for 5 people.  A /16 allows for 65534 devices on a subnet. If you don't need more than 100 devices in a particular location, why waste over 65 thousand IPs?  If you can, draw a building on a whiteboard, and split it in equal parts, then ask if it makes sense for an office to have the exact same space as a bathroom, or as the entire manufacturing area. Then draw a normal office layout and tell them that properly managing IP space is exactly like properly managing room space. Offices that needs a lot will be assigned a large space, offices that needs only a few will be assigned a small space so it will be more efficient.  Edit : Also, if they ask you why you are leaving a lot of IPs unused at the end, you can tell them it is for future expansion. To go back to the building example, if you build a wall in the middle to have two offices that uses all the space, when a new office is needed, they would need to remove the wall and build new ones. Changing existing subnets to make space for a new one involves reconfiguring equipment, which involves time and money instead of just allocating from the unused IP space."

Thousands of prefixes, and your routers are struggling to keep up with any topology changes? You're speeding up convergence, decreasing downtimes, limiting failure scopes thanks to summarization, that's where you should add some lovely graphs.  Anyway - how many sites are there in total? If the answer is ""<100"", ask your mentor ""why do you care about efficient address space utilization?"". The trouble is definitely not worth it.  A word of advice. If you have a dozen huge locations and hundreds of small ones - let the huge ones keep their /16 and give each small one a /24 within a fixed block (maybe even not from 10.0.0.0/8), end of story. Do NOT try to select networks as small as possible for each location. That would complicate management later on and would occasionally lead to errors.

If they are currently giving every site a /16, that's probably not an issue.  But I still don't get the point of the presentation.

networking,3acj4o,Jisamaniac,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:23:25 2015 UTC,"All valid points, i'll add one more bullet to your powerpoint :P  An IP Addressing schema is also a useful tracing tool. For example, you may be able to correlate and/or isolate issues to a smaller set of equipment if there were tickets open only for hosts using a 10.10.15.0/24 netblock , vs a 10.0.0.0/16 netblock.   As a CCNA candidate you're already familiar with the differences between collision domains and broadcast domains.  Using smaller subnets adds more broadcast domains, but reduces broadcast traffic to that individual subnet instead of broadcasts being propagated throughout your entire domain! (imagine ARP traffic only set to 254 hosts instead of 65534!)   If you're at all interested in applying QoS rules (or any sort of rules ) , it's much simpler to do so for a specific netblock that services a group of users with common needs (i.e. developer netblock, marketing netblock) or a particular location instead of tracking individual IPs, which you'll need to if they were all part of one giant 10.0.0.0/16 block.  This also simplifies your configuration for devices, as you'll not have lists of IPs all over, but simple subnets instead.  Which in turn makes it easier to troubleshoot if indeed there is a configuration issue.   hope this helps...."

networking,3af4n1,marx1,4,Fri Jun 19 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"This ALL DAY. We just had a customer RMA his Nexus 9504 and 9372's due to issues:   No ability to support load balanced (vPC) connections across linked 9K chassis of different models, i.e. LAN “A” balanced with LAN “B” for ESX host connectivity. Without the ability, our operation cannot achieve any higher bandwidth than 10GbE from any one ESX host per ESX VSwitch link. Per discussion with Cisco, the requirement to support host NIC load balance can only be support with host links to one Nexus 9K chassis. With this, our ESX farm operation would lose fault tolerance / resiliency for VMWare HA/DRS services. This dual host link requirement was one of the basic needs as shown in the diagram within our Invitation to Bid. Nexus 9K units cannot allow QSFP port groups to be split into different speed groups (40GbE / 10GbE within one chassis / blade), such that more than one blade/ chassis is needed to allow for simultaneous 10GbE / 40 GbE links. Had this been known at the time of bid, the Nexus 9K units would not have been selected as the cost savings advantage / design simplicity would have been lost due to the additional line items needing to be supplied to meet the intended design. As resolution on the Nexus 9504 chassis, Cisco did provide a heavily discounted 9504 blade, however this did not resolve the issue for the Nexus 9372 connections. Intermittent Layer 1 connectivity for several (TX ports) 100MbE / 1GbE connections whenever Spanning Tree Protocol is active with connected edge network switches where non-Cisco brand or earlier version of iOS products such as Cisco 26XX routers are involved in trunked VLANs. This observed phenomenon seems very odd for such a “core” Ethernet device. Inability to make Layer 1 connections on some ports while other ports would easily support connection. Issues would only resolve with a switch reboot. This is also very odd for such a “core” device. As note, Cisco TAC observes the switch port showing up, then down but no resolution was provided. Inconsistent, false port monitoring for Ethernet traffic  statistics. Examples include reported lost packets on 100MbE device management connections made to the Nexus 9372 where the “show Interface” reported no errors.  High latency observed on 1GbE connected untagged ports unrelated to ports tagged ports where STP was active and ANY STP recalculations were made. This issue made the campus network appear to be “flapping” in terms of what the staff users observed and a single link connected device was active on such a switch port."

VSS is not, in my opinion, as elegant a solution as vPC, but it works.    Most Nexus devices will support a 1Gbit SFP in a 10Gbit SFP+ socket to help support some of your legacy gear.  But you are burning a mighty expensive port to accomplish that.    In my experience, the Catalyst 6500+SUP720 is among the most stable network devices ever deployed into a production environment.

Second option which might be a lot better (though I've never done this myself) is to apply ACLs to the switchports themselves. See this for more info, but basically you can apply an ACL to each switchport that can only allow 1 source IP into the interface (that IP being whatever IP you give to the customer connected to that port). I'm not sure if the ACL check is done in hardware or software, but it could be a bit of a performance hit if it is done in software.

Even expert car drivers (think Top Gear) have issues stalling it. Then there is the issue with down force, tire heat, and cornering. Basically when the tires are cold, the car doesn't have all that traction and will lose the backend quite easily. To warm the tires you have to go fast, but, yes you guessed it, how do you go fast when your tires don't have grip. Well aerodynamics. At certain speeds, the downforce generated by the aero parts will keep it there.  What this means is that you not only have to be very careful when driving it, but you actually NEED to go fast, faster than a professional car reviewer will feel safe doing on a track.

This is more economical than driving a grounding rod thru the foundation and it provides a very decent ground for all things electrical.  However, any electrical noise generated on the ground, usually from faulty stuff, or fans and motors, will be propagated along the pipes. The ground will make an ideal reflector for RF noise, and now every water pipe is an antenna.  Proposed solution, try grounding the water pipe at both ends, see if it solves things. If it does, get it fixed properly! If you just ground the pipe at both ends as a permanent solution, you might induce a small current from the voltage difference and corrode your pipe slowly.

If the pops are all interconnected there wouldn't be many reasons not to use the same ASN. If they are islands, separate ASN is more common."
networking,3abmq6,smeuse,12,Thu Jun 18 20:24:36 2015 UTC,"There are not that many options other than:  1) You dont have any interconnection between your POPs (between cities). This might sound odd but you could get away with just buying transit at each city.  2) You buy MPLS or similar L3-WAN from a larger provider (basically a fullmesh between cities but its not you who maintain this - for the POPs it will be just as a single (or doubled for redundancy) uplink, basically just one (or two) interface(s) will be used per POP for interconnection no matter how many POPs you got).  3) You buy VPLS or similar L2-WAN/point to point (most likely) overprovisioned connections. This way the packets from POP1 to POP2 can have multiple physical links but you use only a single (if we ignore redundancy for now) interface at each POP towards each POP. So with 11 POPs each POP would have 10 interfaces towards the other POPs.  4) You buy wavelengths, similar to above (you have your own mesh) but you can then push whatever traffic you like as long as its 1310nm. This will also NOT be overprovisioned and will also be the lowest latency possible. Depending on the wavelength service (how much you pay) the optical fiber provider could ""reroute"" the optical feed in case a physical path goes down (high prio customers will then get optically rerouted through other unused frequencies to bypass the faulty path).  5) You got your own fibernetwork (including amplifiers) and wavelength equipment - this also gives that you can sell off any unused frequencies to better cover your own costs of maintaing a physical network incl. amplifiers (and locations, cooling and power at each amplifier node).  6) In case its not that far (max 80-120km depending on optics) between each POP you could also get away with your own fiber (or hire just darkfiber).  The above assumes that each POP should be able to directly address some other POP. In reality its not uncommon that far off POPs doesnt necessary have a fullmesh capability towards the other POPs but perhaps 1 or 2 ""parent"" POPs which is their uplink to the rest of the network. Also not uncommon that POPs are connected to each other in larger or smaller rings. That is POP2 is connected to POP1 and POP3. While POP3 is connected to POP2, POP4, POP5 and POP6. POP4 is connected to and so on..."

Yes, you could do that, but good luck being able to reason about the topology when looking at failure scenarios.  ""Why do we have separate links between A and B and A and C when a failure in B takes them both out?""  The sheer numbers of links in a full mesh also gets ungainly quickly ((n2 - n)/2).  Follow the physical layer1  and you'll end up with a hierarchy, and with capacity management, the links will be sized to cover the load of local_pop + downstream_pops.  When looking at redundant links, you might have to break the follow-the-physical-layer rule, but that's a conscious decision.  1. because your traffic is going to, regardless of what the L2 and/or L3 topology says."
networking,3abmq6,Apachez,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"Why would you take the full mesh off the table?  Full mesh IS the preferred method for both performance and redundancy. However full mesh can be obtained both physically (one interface towards each POP) or logically (only one interface towards uplink, and then address each POP through this single physical uplink by ip-address).  The downside with (physical) fullmesh is that after a while (as you grow in number of POPs) you will run out of interfaces for the intra-routing but also the costs of having this many P2P-links all across the country.  Which gives that you most likely ends up having full mesh for your ""inner"" core (lets say the 4-8 largest cities) and then from that gets satisfied with various rings (that is when you build out the 9th city you dont order P2P-links towards the other 8 cities but perhaps only P2P-links towards the 2 closest cities).  This picture describes this:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/classconnection/615/flashcards/4987615/jpg/mesh_2-14978C91D2D0A0F2C94.jpg  As you can (in the above example) see Atlanta got 4 ""uplinks"" (for intra-routing) but no directlink to LA (Dallas or San Francisco must be online otherwise LA gets offline)."
networking,3abmq6,IWillNotBeBroken,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"Full mesh IS the preferred method for both performance and redundancy.   That statement depends entirely on the physical details -- particularly in regard to redundancy.  If you have two physical paths out from a POP (let's say two completely diverse physical fiber bundles with a given minimum separation distance), and a full mesh of equally-sized links (either physical or logical), then one outage can take out half of your total capacity by breaking one of your two physical paths. How is that any better redundancy than two diverse physical connections out of the POP, and two (let's say) physical connections (one riding in each fiber bundle)?  You still lose 50% capacity.  With regard to performance, if the connection from A to C must geographically go through B, then you have a very small benefit by having both A-C and A-B links (the benefit is having less hops at whatever layer(s) you're looking at).  If you want your links diverse (which is pretty much a guaranteed requirement with >1 link out of a POP), you're going to start having longer-than-shortest paths in order to meet your diversity requirements as you add more POPs with a full mesh, which increase the latency along that link of the full mesh above what it could be if it was aggregated.  One could argue a small performance benefit by aggregating ten 10G links into one 100G link (serialization delay, although that's probably a wash compared to the parallel serialization you'd get with 10x10G), but management is definitely easier (fewer upgrades needed as each 10G link would need an upgrade as it nears 10G utilization, whereas the aggregate needs to near 100G in order to trigger an upgrade of the larger link, even if one part of the aggregate jumps up to 30G utilization).  There is a big difference between full-mesh, and a full mesh of your (very small number) of large sites.  For example, in my employer's network with ~150 POPs, there are four which are fully-meshed with each other at layer 3, and they're in the same metro area."
networking,3abmq6,Apachez,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"The point here is economy... again the most optimal (from the redundancy, latency and performance point of view) is if each POP has their own direct links (1 or more) to any other POP you have in your infrastructure.  However due to the costs of this you will be forced to choose other less optimal solutions. Which often ends up with having (for example) wavelengths between your 4-8 core POPs and apart from that combine this ""core"" with either ""router on a stick"" (well two sticks for redundancy) where the other POPs only got wavelengths towards just 2 of these core POPs or if you choose to go by a regular L3-WAN from another provider.  This way for your core POPs they can either communicate to each other through their direct links which are preferred (wavelengths and/or darkfibers depending on distance) and to speak to the other POPs they will go through that WAN-link (which of course is limited but still better than push this traffic over a transit through internet).  Designing networks is not only a matter of what kind och cables you will have between the nodes but also calculate for disaster scenarios  regarding setting up proper QoS and such to activate when shit hits the fan."

networking,3abmq6,IWillNotBeBroken,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:08:13 2015 UTC,"One where ""full mesh"" actually means full, not partial, and where the number of sites is more than a handful :-)  A physical network is impractical to do full mesh (above the ""handful of sites"" size), but you could put a full-mesh overlay on top.  What that would give you is an easy traffic matrix.  You can't reason about the network by looking at the overlay, though, because it's hiding all of the details you need, such as any shared-fate between the underlying links or even the utilization of them.  You have to refer back to the lower-layer.  Perhaps you're thinking of something like a full-mesh of TE tunnels, so you can redirect pop1->pop2 traffic as you see fit (constrained by physical capacity of the new path and realities like customer complaints for taking the long way around the world).  If you have a high fanout of diverse (physical) links from your sites, that can make sense. Maybe I have a bit of an irrational distaste of full meshes due my geographic constraints. In Canada the fiber paths roughly follow the population centers, so it tends to look like a coast-to-coast horizontal line (well, rings, but still heavily horizontal).  You'll notice that the national ones all tend to look quite similar, and at-best tend to have a north path and a south path."
networking,3abmq6,Apachez,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:13:41 2015 UTC,Well full mesh in the physical form really means if you got 4 nodes then all nodes have at least one cable toward each other node.  While in logical form it means that each node can still address each other but without the cost of having one (or more) dedicated interfaces towards each other node.

The larger ISPs usually own their fiber between PoPs, but that doesn't mean they can't lease transit from another ISP if it makes sense both economically and technically (buy vs make type of analysis). They may or may not use more than one ASN, typically just one. What happens is a large ISP announces different portions of their network in different cities, so the ASN typically is the same, but the router number/names and the IP blocks are different.  Hope this helps. Please anyone correct me if I am wrong."

So to reach between sites, you'll need to point a default out, which means you lose routing efficiency between each site.  ASNs are very easy to register, so it's highly recommended to give each island a separate one."

Does each POP have a different ASN and they just link up to whatever higher level provider is closest?   Pretty much this, but not with different ASNs; each RPOP only advertises their local IP pools."
networking,3abmq6,Joeymon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"The other important design note is that not all ISP's will inter-connect their POP's privately - depending on size and network purpose sometimes you'll just chuck a pop in to have local router and customer termination, and buy your transit local to that city - you can use the same AS and segregate your prefix for advertisement at the individual POP's.  Once you hit a certain size though - you can inter-connect (which these links are usually cheaper then full transit) and use cost analysis to determine best ingress/egress points of your networks to save more money - for example one of my small POPs ONLY has a private link to our main POP and not pure transit, as it is better economically for network ingress/egress to happen at the major city it backhauls to."

networking,3ac08n,xHeero,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"If it can load balance on src/dst IP and src/dst port it could. Most speedtests use multiple TCP flows, for example speedtest.net uses 4 TCP flows for it's tests, so there would be different source ports for those.  Of course if it is a single flow it will go over one link."
networking,3ac08n,Apachez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:51:27 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking LACP is just a protocol to dynamically setup bonding (2 or more interfaces works as one).  The good side is that you get easy configuration (LACP will take care of which interfaces to bond) and increased total bandwidth.   The downside is that most common setup is that the loadbalancing between the links is not due to packets but due to flows (sessions).   At most you can normally loadbalance (hash) for srcip + srcport + dstip + dstport.  This gives if you got 4x1Gbps in your LACP setup you cant push 4Gbit/s for a single transmission, but you can (if loadbalanced optimally, this is kind of random) push 4 streams at 1Gbit/s per stream (at most).  Some equipment supports per-packet loadbalancing but a common problem for those setups is that packets will then (most likely) arrive out of order on the other side. This is normally not a problem as long as the out of order packets are covered within the receiving window size of the destination host, but its not uncommon that such out of order packets will affect the total bandwidth (the TCP stack will adjust to let the source host send less packets on the wire so the total bandwidth for a specific transmission will drop and not be optimal).  Another common problemscenarion for out of order packets is when various realtime codecs are involved. Its not uncommon that for example VoIP codecs will be unhappy if you got an out of order large than 20ms. Because packets who didnt arrive witin the decoding window (often 20ms or so) will be ignored and the codec will then have to guess how the reconstructed audio should be outputed as.  The above gives that if you are alone on this switch then there will be no difference when doing speedtest before and after using LACP with 4x1Gbps.  But if you do other downloads at the same time from another host then, if lucky, you can get the same difference from speedtest as if you would be alone on the current switch."
networking,3ac08n,Apachez,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"I found many answers in my Google searches, but none of them were as clear as yours. Thanks a ton, that really helps.  Is it a safe bet that a per packet implementation will have all sorts of trouble with pretty much any UDP application?"
networking,3ac08n,the-packet-thrower,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"Na, per packet is really great if you got the exact same length of your cables between the 2 units who will bond and/or if you need more bandwidth than what a single interface can bring you (lets say you have fileservers at 10Gbit interfaces and then only have (for some odd reason but anyway) 1Gbps links left to interconnect this switch with another switch who will have 10Gbps clients).  Another scenario could be if you lets say only have 10Gbit links and aggregated lets say 4 accesswitches into this unit. If you then setup 4x10G towards your uplink with per-packet-loadbalance then each accesswitch will be able to push 10Gbps no matter what. Otherwise you could, if unlucky, end up with one client from each accesswitch going over the same physical cable to the uplink so each client gets 2.5Gbps for their transmission instead of 10Gbps.  The thing with these loadbalance hashing is not that its calculated per session but rather a bitwise operation is performed so the unit know which physical interface should be selected for packets that will be sent.  Lets say you have a hashalgo of only srcip and you only got 2 links. This means if the last bit of the srcip is 0 (even ipaddress) then int1 will be selected, if its 1 (odd ipaddress) then int2 will be selected.  Edit: Also when doing bonding dont forget that a common mistake is that you dont properly monitor the links. If you got lets say 4x1Gbps link who are fully saturated, if 3 of these 4 links breaks for some reason (cable or interface malfunction) you will instantly end up with 75% packet drops which then will end up with even slower transmissions (since most will be retransmissions due to packet drops). So in the case of 4x1Gbps bonding you should setup other paths if the 4x1Gbps path goes above 25% utilization per physical interface."
networking,3ac08n,kWV0XhdO,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:59:04 2015 UTC,"You can never go faster than the member link speed with LACP, instead  you load balance unique flows across the LACP links based on various hashes.

networking,3ac08n,jetter23,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"A contrary view: Everyone who says LACP won't improve a speedtest result is wrong :)  Really, it depends on the specifics of the aggregation and the test.  If the aggregation uses L4 criteria for link selection, then a test against speedtest.net (for example) may well be faster because Ookla uses multiple concurrent threads. Those threads each represent a flow, which may well be balanced across the link members.  If we're talking about a single flow, then yeah, you're limited to the speed of one link member (save Brocade's ""Frame Spray"" - already mentioned here).  But the question wasn't about a single flow. The question was about ""a speedtest""."
networking,3ac08n,Joeymon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:14:30 2015 UTC,Flows will maintain across a single cable. You just basically double the amount of flows that can go through it as you bond the links.

What are your requirements for the routers? It looks like you only have a single RE in each. If you're not doing 10G, full tables or redundant REs per chassis, the MX5s come with like 20x1G SFP ports (and can have their 4x10G interfaces license-enabled later).  And presumably you'll run VRRP on the routers? Then are you thinking static routes or OSPF on your Guest/BYOD ASAs?

It can, you can set up the MXs to do switching (see bridge-domains and IRBs), though with some added complexity.    the MX104 is replacing the MX5.   That could be the case, but I haven't heard that yet. I don't think Juniper has EoL'd the MX5-80 yet, so stepping up to a 104 if you don't have the requirements seems like a waste of money. That said, if your VAR will get you 104s for the price of MX5s, go for it (but I'd probably still bid this out).   I did not plan on VRRP. Something to think about though.   I would encourage it. Rather than making your links between routers strictly L3 and iBGP, you can make them VLAN trunks, run iBGP on one small like /31 VLAN and then create VLANs for your other downstream links to run VRRP on. The VRRP config is quite simple (do remember to enable accept-data or whatever on them, though).  How do you plan to force datacenter traffic to take Carrier A while user traffic takes Carrier B? Announce different prefixes and use policy-based routing for outgoing? Are you NATing on your firewalls or are they going to be bridging?

To prevent false positives you can set up two tracking objects and then do a bolean of the two,e.g.:  track 1 rtr 1 reachability track 2 rtr 2 reachability track 3 list boolean and  object 1  object 2  then in your HSRP config:  standby 2 priority 110   standby 2 track 3 decrement 20  *sorry formatting is screwed"

They know their products are complicated and would rather you pay the VAR to help get you up and running quickly rather than have you depend on their TAC for simple set up help.

I did perform a failover to the newRR last night and it worked, I had access to everything but what was odd is I could not ping my secondary data center (10.1.100.1 - not involved in tunnels) from the site while on the vpn tunnel however I could connect and RDP servers in the location. Very confusing."
networking,3ab4vq,sirianthe3rd,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:52:44 2015 UTC,Are the routes for those missing subnets in the BGP table?
networking,3ab4vq,sirianthe3rd,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:23:16 2015 UTC,"When I run a ""sh ip bgp"" on a destination site backing up to NewRR I get those ~50 internal subs and another ~50 external addresses for MPLS. Every entry has an external IP for the sites MPLS line listed and every entry has a 10.35.25.x entry which is the cellular backup. However the only entries that have the 10.40.50.x entry are the default 0.0.0.0 route and the 5 subnets that are on the NewRR router in the bgp as network. So on a destination router every entry has 2 routes, 6 entries have 3 as they should. I can edit up a ""sh ip bgp"" full table from whatever router you want and link it if you want."

If you're making a change, and shit blows up - roll it back.  Don't wait to find out if it was YOU who broke it, just roll it back.  Customers, internal or external do not care what happened, they care that their service was down.   If you're doing the text file/peer review thing, make sure you include every single command, start to finish to make the change (even ssh $hostname).  AND all the commands to roll it back to the exact state it was in prior to the change (if its something that can be rolled back).  Both should be peer reviewed with equal scrutiny.

But to take an example from something I have done in the past, if the change you made are to a core switch/router and not everything going through it is affected by your wrong doing, then you don't want to rollback the entire config as that often entails rebooting the entire device. Just trying to undo the change you did if successful wont be noticed by the part of the network that wasn't affected in the first place."
networking,3a79su,vauxhallvxr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:15:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this varies - depends on the size of your network.  It's one of those grey areas.  Unless you're ready to say in the middle of an outage with 100% certainty, ""my change didn't do this"".  Just rollback and cover your ass.  I mean if you reboot a TOR or two, and the core blows up - sure obviously it doesn't matter.  But if you fuck up an OSPF cost in the wrong place, sometimes it doesn't matter where."
networking,3a79su,The_Packeteer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:32:35 2015 UTC,"Some folks don't have a good backup process which makes it difficult if you're using a network platform (like older cisco IOS) which doesn't support roll-backs unless you set up a configuration archive in the switch (highly recommended).  If you don't have such a process in place it's not always as easy as just loading a file, but any respectable network SHOULD have a process like this. If they don't and an issues arises the blame should really lay on the shoulders of the IT manager or senior engineers."
networking,3a79su,vauxhallvxr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:37:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, things like upgrades are tough - I typically toss those in the ""no rollback possible"" unless shit severely breaks.  It's going to vary."

networking,3a79su,NotHyplon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:37:22 2015 UTC,Not as easy to do on the core switch. It's one thing for me to break a vlan temporarily. It's another thing to ask the entire organization to stop everything they are doing for 10 minutes or more while I reboot the switch. AFAIK I can't reload from saved configs over the live running config without a reboot. (Though if I am wrong on that would love to hear otherwise!)
networking,3a79su,vauxhallvxr,3,Thu Jun 18 15:45:12 2015 UTC,It's a small team. We do review when we can. But not everything can wait around till someone has time to review it.    Sorry but that is not a valid excuse. Either it is reviewed or the change does not go ahead. This is required in many industry compliance programs (i.e ISO).

I promise you, ""but but... you told me to!"" isn't a valid excuse when senior management is screaming at him.  If you can't tell your boss it's going to take some extra time to verify what you're going to do isn't going to blow shit up, (and you need to inform him if it could, and how bad) then you need to mature as an engineer/employee.  You're FAR less likely to get fired if you take 30 minutes to verify your changes, than if you nuke your network from orbit because you didn't.  And if you're not the only engineer, the same thing applies with the exception that someone ELSE is going to have to vet the change (Sr. Engineers fuck up all the time).  If it's truly an emergency change that could impact the network, make a phone call, or page someone.

Currently the IBGP sessions are setup as ""family inet"" meant to just exchange IPv4 routes.  Ultimately what I'm trying to accomplish is enable the IBGP sessions to carry IPv4-VPN routes which means I need to add in ""family inet-vpn"".   I'm concerned that doing so will cause the current IBGP sessions to flap.  So what I'd like to do is setup a secondary IBGP session to both test this theory as well as test the implementation of a L3VPN over this secondary IBGP session."
networking,3aaouj,Xipher,3,Thu Jun 18 16:27:21 2015 UTC,"I don't believe you can do so over the existing loopbacks. Since you can't run BGP on an alternate port, there is no way to discern the difference between the two sessions you want to configure on the same IP. You will have to setup another loopback on each if you want to have inet-vpn isolated.  Also, adding it will cause the existing session to flap.  I should add, I know this because I did this in a lab previously with branch SRXs in packet mode."

You see a incoming BGP Syn from the same neighbour. On that connection you see a BGP Open. At that point the correct thing to do is the TCP RST the current BGP session and negotiate the new session.  Adding the new NRLI will cause BGP to clear down and reconnect, as NRLI is negotiated at BGP Open.  tl;dr: suck it up, arrange a planned maintenance. Maybe add the multicast NRLI whilst you are at it."

Learned which MAC addresses were on either side of it and would make forwarding decisions accordingly Switch - Switches traffic based on layer-2 information (MAC addresses for Ethernet). Learns which MAC address are connected to every port. Basically every port on a switch is a bridge   Of course this barely scratches the surface, as we now have switches that can forward based on layer-3, so they've become routers.

Most of these answers are off the top of my head and not backed up by research so they might not be right.  1) Yes, in most cases octetes == bytes.  YMMV if you use an OS different from Windows, Mac OS, Linux, or Free/Open/NetBSD (basically any operating you're likely to see).  It's up to the operating system and/or hardware to determine what a ""byte"" is where as an ""octet"" is fixed for ever.  2) Flow control is layer 2 (on the directly attached link).  TCP is layer 4.  Does that answer your question?  2) Flow control is the mechanism by which basic data transfer decisions are made (emphasis mine):   What distinguishes TCP from these protocols is the sliding window mechanism that controls the flow of data between devices. This system not only manages the basic data transfer process, it is also used to ensure that data is sent reliably, and also to  manage the flow of data between devices to ensure that data is transferred efficiently without either device sending data faster than the other can receive it.   from: http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPReliabilityandFlowControlFeaturesandProtocolMod.htm  3) Usually it would be the operating system.

TCP itself is responsible for the reordering of the data, and TCP is part of the kernel: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/tcp.c  Data is received by TCP and placed in a buffer, then acknowledged. The data stays in this TCP kernel buffer (potentially requiring reordering / waiting for previous segments to arrive) until the a user process that has the particular socket executes the read() system call on the socket's file descriptor. The data is then copied from kernel space into user space  This actually ties into your flow control question. The receiver continually signals back to the sender via the window size parameter in the TCP ACK the size of the kernel buffer. If the user space application isn't read()'ing the data from the kernel fast enough, you eventually run out of kernel buffer, the window size goes to zero and the sender stops sending."

networking,3a8ed8,maxiums,3,Thu Jun 18 01:28:24 2015 UTC,Do you have ip helper enabled as you will need that for the dhcp requests. I use a windows server for dhcp and have a segment for each vlan and just use ip helper.
networking,3a8ed8,Newdles,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:49:40 2015 UTC,Likely your issue op. IP helper will convert the dhcp requests to unicast and send the requests to your dhcp server in the correct subnet.
networking,3a8ed8,wolffstarr,2,Thu Jun 18 08:47:12 2015 UTC,This is incorrect. ip helper-address is for crossing VLAN boundaries; he's configuring the SonicWall to serve IP address space through a port on the SonicWall that is untagged VLAN 5 (or should be).   One uses ip helper-addresses when you have a DHCP server that is on a single subnet/VLAN and you wish it to server addresses to multiple subnets/VLANs. That is not the case here.
networking,3a8ed8,maxiums,2,Thu Jun 18 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"You are right, he must have something configured wrong with his dhcp setup on the sonicwall or the static route to his core switch."

networking,3a8ed8,sirianthe3rd,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:31:12 2015 UTC,"Port gi1/0/2 (connected to X2) is an access port on VLAN 5.  The VLAN does appear when I run show vlan.  sh mad add vlan 5 does return MAC addresses of the D-Link switches connected to my trunk ports (gi1/0/46-48) but not the mac address of the SonicWall, nor does it list any MAC addresses as connected to gi1/0/2.  The switch can ping the X2 interface (192.168.5.1) from the interface VLAN 5. (I tried to ping from a port, e.g. gigabitethernet1/0/45, which I currently have set to be an access port on VLAN 5 for testing purposes, but it said invalid source.)"
networking,3a8ed8,maxiums,2,Thu Jun 18 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds like what you need are simple access ports. Based on what you said about the core switch, if you're connecting that to your TZ210 you don't need to tag any traffic.  VLAN1 has 192.168.1.0/24 - SonicWall X0  VLAN5 has 192.168.5.0/24 - SonicWall X2  Core switch:  Port 47 VLAN 1  Port 48 VLAN 5  These ports on your switch should be untagged access ports, unless you need to pass multiple VLANs per port (tagging/trunking).  In the former case, the switch config is easy:  int g1/0/2  description To SonicWall X2  switchport mode access  switchport access vlan 5  int g1/0/1  description To SonicWall X0  switchport mode access   The Sonicwall needs to make sure you have the correct DHCP scope setup and that it's set to use the right outbound interface. The ports your connecting devices to need to have their access VLAN set to the VLAN you want to get traffic flowing through. If those ports need to be tagged for whatever reason, then you'll need to set the native VLAN to the VLAN that you want untagged traffic to flow through. So if VLAN5 is your normal data VLAN, then set the port to trunk, change native VLAN to 5, and you should be golden. This is actually the old school way to do phones daisy-chained with computers behind them.  Make sense?"
networking,3a8ed8,BGOOCHY,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:47:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That's how I have it configured on int gi1/0/2, minus the description. And I just left gi1/0/1 as default as it seems to be carrying all the main LAN traffic just fine. I've double- and triple-checked the DHCP settings on the SonicWall, including making sure it's bound to interface X2.  My normal data VLAN is the default (1). VLAN 5 is the guest network. I've verified that I can ping 192.168.5.1 (X2) from VLAN 5 on the switch, so I know they're talking. Just can't figure out why DHCP isn't flowing.  (The SonicWall automatically sets static routes and firewall rules, and they all seem to be correct and analogous to the client where I have this set up and working.)"

At a minimum, knowing the topology puts you in a similar realm to a work environment; you're not going to necessarily get told ""You have 20 minutes to figure out why our EIGRP network is broken"" as soon as you walk in the door Day One.

I know that sounds harsh, but the topology is as straight-forward and simple as they could have possibly made it while incorporating all of the proper technologies.  Cisco doesn't design the topology to trick you. They show you an overview physical and logical topology throughout the exam and if you are prepared it shouldn't take more than about 1 min to look at and completely understand the network they lay out. You'll still have to reference the topology to know what ports/IPs are supposed to be used, but the flow of data and routing/switching structure is very clear."

Also, I said ""you have 20 minutes to figure out why our EIGRP network is broken"". This is not the same as ""net no worky fix plz"". If your employer is using EIGRP and it's breaking the entire network, the odds of you being the lone wolf network guy are fairly low, and you're unlikely to have only 20 minutes to fix it. In other words, someone ELSE is being told ""net no worky, fix plz"".

The very first thing I ask people is ""Okay, so what on your resume do you actually have job experience with, and what was just from school/self-study"".  In most cases, that three page resume becomes a few bullet points of actual experience."
networking,3a9ksp,snowbirdie,2,Sun Jun 21 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Don't be one of those ignorant people who assume.  I force people to do a lab during the interview.  I don't ask any question that requires memorization.  I only care about critical thinkers, something 90% of the people cannot do.  Anyone can Google up the details of a protocol.   Now you're the one assuming. I never said you specifically do this. I said it's done and it most definitely is.  My last statement was this:    If you're doing the interview right it won't matter if someone crammed beforehand or not.   What you do is exactly the right way to do it. But not everyone does and you can't know beforehand what the process will be like so you have to be prepared for it to go either way. That just doesn't make someone a cheater in my opinion."
networking,3a7roe,hindware,3,Wed Jun 17 22:04:56 2015 UTC,"You should really clarify this with your service provider.  The 802.1q type id is 0x8100, which in this context is also referred to as a C-Tag, CVLAN, or Customer VLAN.  Option 1 doesn't make sense since the VLANs are already tagged with ""C-Tags"", you can't ""encapsulate"" them with another C-Tag, since they explicitly told you they are expecting a single tag.  Option 2 is likely, but it's up to them on how they implement it for transport.  Did they explicitly tell you they are using 802.1ad (QnQ)? Did they ask for a specific list of VLANs to transport?"
networking,3a7roe,NetworkMagician,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That makes sense, they expect 0x8100, which means we can only tag that one vlan. Ideally, shouldn't they expect multiple c-tags ?"
networking,3a7roe,NetworkMagician,3,Wed Jun 17 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"They said ""one tag"" as in a single tag per frame, not stacked. They did not say ""one VID"", as in you can send ""multiple VLANs,"" each single tagged but various VIDs."
networking,3a7roe,sedsnewoldg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:51:55 2015 UTC,"Ideally, yes....and in most cases, that will probably work just fine.   Depending on their transport and core - multiple tags may present a problem. I can't emphasize enough how important it is that you verify if they will support a single CVID with TPID 0x8100 or if they will suppoprt any CVID with TPID 0x8100"
networking,3a7roe,kombiwombi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:28:45 2015 UTC,"It's worse than that, because spanning tree BPDUs don't have TPID 0x8100. So they are saying that they won't transport spanning tree, LLDP and so on transparently. Let alone untagged VLAN 1 frames.  I'd be pushing back on the ISP for a properly-configured service. Usually the only contraint we place is on the number of visible MAC addresses (and only then if the service has more than two endpoints) and a reminder that we might (under temporary conditions) transmit the same frame multiple times (which can upset some IPsec anti-replay measures)."
networking,3a7roe,Honky_Cat,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:36:37 2015 UTC,We ignore the VPLS aspect to it - just send your tagged VLANs to the CE and they will send whatever you send in across the VPLS network.
networking,3a7roe,goramuth,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:24:23 2015 UTC,"Ask them, to put it in MEF terms and find out if they are MEF compliant.  This is like the one instance where MEF has a use."
networking,3a6xr5,imangelslv,4,Wed Jun 17 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"Take a look at Brocade IP Primer. It teaches the basics of networking. IP addresses, subnet masks, switches, routers, routing protocols, load balancing.  It is written in an approachable manner, it starts with the assumption that you know what a computer is and that's it.  It is not going too deep into things, but it's not too much to read and it will help you understand the basics before moving on to more in-depth litterature."
networking,3a6xr5,CBRjack,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:43:25 2015 UTC,I think that is the first time I've seen brocade recommended for training
networking,3a6xr5,the-packet-thrower,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:10:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was surprised at first, but it's really geared toward beginners. It doesn't go in depth, so it's kinda useless for advanced training, but as a starting point, it makes senses."
networking,3a6xr5,CBRjack,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:22:52 2015 UTC,Neat
networking,3a6xr5,the-packet-thrower,2,Thu Jun 18 21:27:23 2015 UTC,Try Network+ as a starting point. http://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Network-All-In-One-Exam-Guide/dp/0071789227
networking,3a6xr5,Alexbeav,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:16:36 2015 UTC,"OMG I completely forgot about these! I used these in college for all my classes. They have networking, switching, routing, system administration, any thing you can imagine they will have a course for it. They come with exams and certifications too. They even have virtual labs you can use during the exams and while using the study material. It is a very useful tool to educate yourself."
networking,3a6xr5,DONT_PM_ME_NOTHIN,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"A+, Network+, Security+ and Server+ (once the new version comes out) and you have yourself a very solid foundation and understanding of how things work. After that you expand to where you feel like you belong."
networking,3a6xr5,Alexbeav,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:48:40 2015 UTC,The first one I got was the Network+ certification. I had so much fun using this program! It made learning the information much easier. Plus you get to listen to LabSim Louie!!!
networking,3a6xr5,DONT_PM_ME_NOTHIN,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:51:31 2015 UTC,From the end of your post it seems like you are looking for some information on system administration. Excuse me if I am wrong but English does not seem to be your first language. Can you elaborate on what it is you are looking to learn more specifically?
networking,3a6xr5,DONT_PM_ME_NOTHIN,2,Wed Jun 17 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"Hahahah sorry about it, isn't first language and also I didn't check twice.  I'm just want to set networks, mostly at home, so I have connected all my devices. Probably to understand networks at work too (make my life easier) I do not work with networks precisely but we use it often (private networks) and sometimes when the network isn't working understand the problem (witch I do, but to fix some problems too)"
