They get set off by just about anything (or nothing at all), they aren't held closed very tightly, AND the mice have chewed out of them (see previous point, once they get an edge to chew, it's all over).  In my experience these work much better, as long as the tail isn't long enough to hold part of the door flap open: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Nkb-dJ9tL._SX300_.jpg  Potentially, a larger version of the same design would be the best case scenario.  Also, since I'm talking mouse traps here, THIS KIND also works terribly (at keeping them alive) as it always gets them stuck with their head/neck pinched in the contraption when it tries to flip them into the live storage section.  Good idea, bad execution (no pun intended).  Yeah, we have mice in the house rather often.... (but not right now thankfully, even if they always return somehow)."

The first two were caught when I was nearby, so I got to them right away and was able to release them within a couple minutes. The third one was caught while I was in the shower (I heard the scrabbling noise when I turned the water off) so he was in there for at least 15 minutes before I got to him. He had already chewed a sizeable hole  where I'd cut the bottle, and would have gotten free in another 5-10 minutes.  If you're going to use one of these, only set it when you're home and near enough to hear the trap. Don't leave it set overnight or when you're at work or you'll wake up/come home to a sprung trap with a hole chewed through it and will have to make a new one."

One day i set up my phone to record. Turns out a rat was drilling through the thick plastic of the worm farm. the rat suspended itself between the wall and the worm farm and drilled away. Upon inspection there were a few inch wide holes. Further to that they had a network of tunnels under the paving under the worm farm to get access. I tried building traps. At this stage there were many rats, I could sit in the living room add watch them approach the traps in broad daylight. you could see them scope it and then fucking piss bolt when they realized it was a trap. After this experience, I gained massive respect for rats. I think they are second to humans on this planet for intelligence and I will leave them be now unless they become a real problem. I find their numbers grow and plummett a lot, so what seems like a big problem maybe isn't."

interestingasfuck,3dzs8j,lolzergrush,136,Tue Jul 21 05:08:00 2015 UTC,"Former Disney World lifeguard here.  Regulations may have gotten more strict in the last 15 years but I doubt they've gotten any more lax (no pun intended). The moment there's a fecal incident, the lifeguard dealing with it uses the same signal as if they were just performing a rescue. The reason for that is that their attention is diverted from the swimmers in their zone, so other lifeguards have to adjust their zone to keep the entire area covered, even for a matter of 30 seconds or so.  As soon as people are away from the immediate area, second step is to close off the entire pool. Basically, all water that's part of the same system, so that could mean a simple pool & waterslide at a hotel or a gigantic wave pool that can accommodate thousands of swimmers. Everyone gets out, security is alerted,   Once the situation is safe (i.e. people are no longer climbing on top of each other trying to get out), steps are taken to preserve the person's dignity, it all depends on the situation...again no pun intended. If there's any way to minimize the embarrassment of course they'll take it but not if it means taking their attention off the pool while people are still in it.   (No matter what, if even one person is in the water then there is a lifeguard watching, and a security camera backing them up. With up to a half million swimmers every day, accidental drowning deaths at WDW are virtually nonexistent for a reason.)  Once all the guests are out of the pool and lifeguards agree that the bottom is clear, now it's cleanup time. Any removable solids are skimmed out and placed into a biohazard container if one is available. Since lifeguards always have nitrile gloves, we're the ones who get to do the hands-on aspect of this, lucky us. Next, they shock the ever-loving fuck out of the water. Only 10 ppm of free chlorine is needed but for public perception sake they usually take it up to 25-30 ppm which is enough to smell it from the parking lot.  How long the pool stays closed after the chlorine shock really depends on where it is the since there are so many tourists in the larger attractions. 24 hours would be a good rule of thumb but this would be impractical for the water parks during peak season. It mostly depends on how public the fecal incident was - if there was a crowd of thousands standing around gawking at a giant floating cloud of diarrhea then it will probably stay closed for at least 2 days.   Also if the pH was out of the ideal range for some reason they have to bring it down to below 7.8 or the chlorine isn't effective, so that takes longer to add acid and circulate.  Now here's the interesting part, Cryptosporidum parvum and Giardia lamblia are both intestinal pathogens that are chlorine resistant. It was still a new research topic 15 years ago, so now I don't know what they do but they may have added some additional measures. My guess would be that every major water attraction nowadays has a UV disinfection system somewhere or some sort of inline ozone device in addition to the chlorine.  So to sum up:   Lifeguard calls for backup Get people away from it Signal all lifeguards to clear the pool Poop scoop Shock the pool like the angry fist of Zeus raining down righteous fury Management decides how long to stay closed   Hope that helps! They keep chlorine levels pretty high anyway. Almost all pathogens are dead the moment they hit the water anyway - for instance, even if an HIV positive victim is bleeding profusely there's basically no risk until they're out of the water. At the pool I worked this almost never happened but some of the bigger water park lifeguards said they had a fecal incident about once a week in the summer."

interestingasfuck,3dzs8j,synestheseizure,13,Tue Jul 21 08:46:11 2015 UTC,"This post was stunningly interesting. Keep telling me more of the world of water parks. I could read all day.   As an aside... I remember summer days at our tiny little outdoor public pool in town. When lifeguards found a floaty, it was a whistle for everyone to clear to the edges, skim it off, then a whistle for the all clear. I am skeptical that they went through the same cleansing procedures you described."

interestingasfuck,3dzs8j,SovietK,4,Tue Jul 21 07:19:34 2015 UTC,So you only remove what solids you can and thats it? I'm ignorant as fuck but I thought you'd change all the water although I know thats expensive.
interestingasfuck,3dzs8j,lolzergrush,7,Tue Jul 21 07:12:45 2015 UTC,"Not just expensive - in the summertime it's nearly impossible.  In Florida, we have a high water table. That means that during the wet season, the water table surrounding the pool is actually only 3 to 4 feet deep.  So if you drain a 10 foot deep pool, and the water table is 4 feet deep, then it's the same thing as having a balloon filled with air 6 feet underwater. The buoyant force upwards for a 50,000 gallon pool (typical hotel) is enough to crack the concrete, break the pipes, and completely destroy the pool.  During the wet season, before draining you have to do a quick geotechnical survey to check the water table level, and then bring in truckloads of sandbags to weigh it down."

Actually, free chlorine does not smell. It's the chloramines that are formed when the chlorine reacts with nitrogenous contaminants in the water. Basically, you're smelling the chlorine that does its work and in the described case, there sure is work to do."

interestingasfuck,3dzs8j,Drunkenaviator,33,Tue Jul 21 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"""Saturday, July 24, 1982 - A 15-year-old boy drowned in a wave pool at Action Park in McAfee, New Jersey.  Sunday, August 1, 1982 - In an accident at Action Park in McAfee, New Jersey, a 27-year-old man was killed after being electrocuted while on the Kayak Experience ride. Two other victims also suffered electrical shock and were hospitalized. An investigation by the New Jersey Labor Department concluded that, although the ride's equipment was properly installed and maintained, an electrical problem existed in an underwater electrical fan system, used to simulate rapids. The current in the motor circuit of an underwater fan that churned the surface of the water had the potential to incur bodily injury under certain circumstances. The investigation ultimately concluded that no safety laws or ride regulations were violated. A park spokesman said that the investigation had absolved the park of responsibility, claiming that there was no ""proof"" of mechanical failure. The Kayak Experience was drained and closed after the incident."""

I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for. Thanks."
interestingasfuck,3dxsut,revolved,23,Mon Jul 20 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"First, you're confusing memes and ""memes"". Do you remember what they were before they were officially called ""memes""? Can you point to two pre-""meme"" phenomenons, using impact font plus images (aside from ICHC), before Socially Awkward Penguin and company showed up?  And, just to be clear, you say you're a former 4chan ""memer"" who loves Advice Animals. You ""cut your teeth"" making ""clever and easily digestible"" memes to ""reflect on society"" and ""relate some story to your audience""?"" You posted on 4chan and this is how you write?  And why does the number of times I posted to Advice Animals matter? I unsubscribed because a) it fucking sucks, b) that sub was created by people who owned a meme creation site and were exploiting the phenomenon for ad revenue.  And, back to the first question, if you're so knowledgable about memes, why did you think Moskau was the first? Can you link me one Moskau image with impact text from back in the day?  Sorry but everything you're writing here makes you seem like more of a phony than before.  Edit: did you respond with the wrong account or what's up?  Edit 2: You got me good."

interestingasfuck,3e2lcp,Phyrexian_Starengine,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:07 2015 UTC,"Why do they stretch out like that?  With the moon the tides are facing the moon and facing away from the moon, so if anything they should be elongated to/away from each other, rather than just pulled out like that.  Plus wouldn't the gravity have to be insanely strong for that to happen?  I mean, at the surface of earth the gravity is ""normal"" (what do we measure gravity in?) which isn't terribly strong.  The pull on the other planet would be less than ""normal"" until the planet made contact with earth.  I could see some kind of sheering force, where the difference between gravity at the surface and gravity at the opposite surface was so different that it structurally started to destroy the planet, but again it doesn't seem to be THAT different."
interestingasfuck,3e2lcp,Team_Braniel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"The tides rising ""away from"" the moon is a misconception. The near side's water rises toward the moon most. The earth's core moves toward the moon some. The far side's water moves toward the moon the least. Nothing moves away from the moon but standing on the solid beach near the far side could give that perception."
interestingasfuck,3e2lcp,kaihatsusha,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"From what I understand that is wrong.  From what I understand it compresses the earth slightly into an elipsoid.

interestingasfuck,3e2lcp,Team_Braniel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:05 2015 UTC,"Gravity doesn't ""push"". That is simply difference in gravitational strength relative to the gravity at the planet's center of mass. The far side is further from the satellite than the cm, so gravity will be less there than on the near side, but the field in both cases is still pointing toward the satellite."

It works by trading pressure for height, eventually the internal pressure of the system won't be enough to pull the liquid back up to the top of the flask. So putting in a pin wheel to extract energy, would just cause it to stop sooner.  (you would have had better results simply pouring the liquid onto the pinwheel yourself.)

The bobbin is not attached to anything; it is free floating loosely within an enclosure to simply stop it from rolling away. Imagine a cereal bowl with a tennis ball inside it. You (the sewing machine) are holding the bowl (enclosure) with one hand, a loop of string in the other, and the tennis ball (bobbin) is just sitting there in the bowl. It's perfectly possible to pass that string under and around the ball without climbing your whole body through the loop, or getting all tangled up in it. Sewing machines work just like that, with the addition of a second thread coming out of the bobbin which gets trapped by the first to form a stitch, then the process repeats. The thread doesn't pass around the rotating shuttle hook or any other part of the machine, just the floating bobbin."

Microdium is a genus of fossil crab, (or, at least, Family Cancridae).  I don't know whether that helps in figuring out a material (or even if Wham-O actually used crushed fossil shells), but it might be a start.   http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-362433.html  Edit:    Magic Window (1971), was made from two 30 by 30 centimetres (12 in × 12 in) oval plates of heavy clear plastic, with a narrow channel between them containing ""Adamantium"" (glass) crystal sands of varying colors. The concept behind the Magic Window toy came from inventor Roy L. Cloutier, who had a degree in Engineering Physics from Michigan Tech.[12] In 2012, the current owners of the original patent made a slightly modified version of the Magic Window available, created and marketed without Wham-O's involvement.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wham-O  Microdium appears to have been a gimmick name, coincidentally related to the crab.  edit 2: From the patent   Example 2: A three-component or three-class particulate mass is prepared by filling the device with equal parts by volume of (1) iodized table salt having a particle size range of approximately 300 to 500 microns with the salt crystals being coated black with an alkyd enamel; (2) solid soda-lime glass beads having about 80 percent of the total in the size range of 177 to 350 microns with a coating of fluorescent spray paint glowing blue and having density properties similar to the glass beads of Example 1, and (3) glass microballoons made of sodium borosilicate glass and similar to the microballoons spheres of Example 1 except that the spray-paint is a fluorescent paint glowing cerise.   http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN/3692382"

Because I've seen so much poor hygiene in kitchens it makes me wonder if the chances of food poisoning are a lot lower than is generally thought and that it's kinda like a lottery. Most likely cause is probably sick worker. That been said I've had food poisoning 3 times and it's not pretty."

It is located in the single most beautiful bit of land I have ever been, surrounded by towering mountains, waterfalls off glaciers and wildlife everywhere.  See the vsauce video to see what I mean.  However the people that live there are mostly doing so as workers in the salmon industry, and while they are a hardy hard working lot, they are small town in the worst of ways.  It is a bit bigoted and minorities are given the worst jobs of those available, at least that is how it was when I was there.  Hopefully things have improved since then.

Each layer of this cube is 19 by 8, which seemed odd to me, because 1,000,000 is not exactly divisible by 152 (19 x 8 = 152)... I wondered why not make it 20 by 8, which means it could then be exactly 6250 tall. But 20 by 8 would be 52.2"" by 49.12"", meaning the face of the ""cube"" isn't actually square.  I then noted that a stack of 6,579 bills should only be 28.29"" tall, at a thickness of .0043"" per bill. They're using handled money, so the bills average .0076"" thick in practice in this display, but what if they actually used new, non-circulated currency, so it would stack at maximum density? Could they make a smaller cube?  Let's start with possible layer dimensions. We know we want a cube smaller than the ~50"" per side of the cube in the picture. The following square layers can be created, with a length-width difference of less than an inch:   2 by 1 --> .92"" difference 5 by 2 --> .77"" difference 7 by 3 --> .15"" difference 12 by 5 --> .62"" difference 14 by 6 --> .30"" difference 19 by 8 --> .47"" difference   Let's re-order these by closest-to-square:   7 by 3 --> .15"" difference 14 by 6 --> .30"" difference 19 by 8 --> .47"" difference 12 by 5 --> .62"" difference 5 by 2 --> .77"" difference 2 by 1 --> .92"" difference   We can see there are only two options that would make a better layer. Are either of these possible?  With a 7 by 3 layer, each layer contains 21 bills, meaning we need 47,620 layers. At a minimum thickness of .0043"" per layer, that ""cube"" (which is 18.27"" by 18.42"") would be 204.77"" tall. Clearly, this isn't an option -- the bills are more than 11 times too thick to make a cube.  Okay, but what about 14 by 6? This would give us 84 bills per layer, so we would need 11,905 layers. At .0043"" thickness, that ""cube"" (which is 36.54"" by 36.84"") would be 51.2"" tall. This is a lot closer, but even perfect, optimally-stacking bills would still be about 40% too thick.  The next best option is the cube we see, which is 19 by 8 in each layer, or 49.59"" by 49.12"", less than half an inch out of square. (The frame is probably at least 50"" by 50"" and built actually square, and the stacks pack imperfectly, spreading out slightly to fill the space ""tightly"".) This cube requires 6,579 layers (with some stacks missing one single bill -- or alternately 6,578 layers, but some stacks have a single $1 bill replaced with a $2 bill, so the number of bills in each stack can be uniform). This many layers of ""perfect"" bills would require 6,579 x .0043"" = 28.29"" of height, well below our ~50"" length and width of the money cube. The currency is bundled, though, and those paper wrappers take up space. And the money has been handled so does not pack as efficiently. A brief internet search suggests that a stack of real currency re-bundled in a bank is about 3/4"" for 100 bills. At that thickness, our stack of 6,579 bills would end up being 49.3425"" tall, which works out very nicely."

Just enough time to firmly establish himself as a father figure in my dad's life, my dad would have been too young to understand anything other than one of the people that was supposed to love him more than anyone else just wasn't going to be there anymore. I've only ever heard him acknowledge his biological father once, when I was breaking up with the mother of my daughter,  he wouldn't say it directly, but he wanted me to know how important it was that I didn't leave my daughter behind. I would never have done that anyways, but it helped me understand him more as a person."

Smartphones may be one the least ergonomic, yet mass used devices ever.    Somehow Steve Jobs convinced the world that, "" thin beautiful light ( plain )  "" is that matters in terms of design....and now we are all stuck with boring slabs for smartphones.    Its really pretty crazy... The one device that people can't stop using, and its not made for a human hand.     Size isn't  the issue at all here...   I'm talking in terms of holding something this ""thin"" ... especially when trying to use touchscreen at same time.   Look at every other product designed for the hand... Tv remotes, old flip phones, bottles, cans, toothbrush, handles for any tools... there is some roundness...something to grab.... it's so simple we don't even notice it.   But the smartphone... fucking nope. complete opposite... and we act like its amazing.    last but not least... you can definitely make something grabable that easily slides and fit into the pocked... soo... don't give me that."
interestingasfuck,3dtott,niggytardust2000,48,Sun Jul 19 14:04:02 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? Thin phones were a thing way before Apple made a phone. The razr was the most popular phone when it first came out. They're built like that to fit in your pocket.
interestingasfuck,3dtott,FuckBrendan,7,Sun Jul 19 14:28:17 2015 UTC,Ding ding ding. This guy has his own bullshit narrative and is way too verbose considering he's just saying the same shit repeatedly.
interestingasfuck,3dtott,originalityescapesme,11,Sun Jul 19 20:30:05 2015 UTC,So this guy wants a smartphone shaped like a TV remote basically. I can't imagine anything more cumbersome or hard to fit in a pocket.
interestingasfuck,3dtott,jilko,3,Sun Jul 19 18:23:13 2015 UTC,Their handhelds aren't really that ergonomic niggy. That's what you should be looking at as an example more than their consoles.
interestingasfuck,3dtott,badgraphix,2,Sun Jul 19 18:21:02 2015 UTC,? I find phones perfectly fine ergonomically.. Maybe you just have massive hands?
interestingasfuck,3dtott,CactiChill,9,Sun Jul 19 19:59:24 2015 UTC,So an updated Handspring Visor?
interestingasfuck,3dtott,aeneasfate,3,Sun Jul 19 12:54:45 2015 UTC,Holy crap I forgot all about Handspring!!
interestingasfuck,3dtott,linoleumknife,135,Sun Jul 19 13:40:13 2015 UTC,"Looks kind of bad, honestly.  Cameras should be integrated.  The controls should be as vast the 3ds. It would more than likely be a slider like the PSP go, or clamshell like the 3ds.  Cartridges are a good idea, but they probably don't need to be that big and clunky.  The design will probably continue to follow the apple aesthetic that Nintendo seems to like."
interestingasfuck,3dtott,Colorfag,72,Sun Jul 19 13:40:41 2015 UTC,"The camera is integrated, the slot in one gives 3d."
interestingasfuck,3dtott,tatch,17,Sun Jul 19 14:01:05 2015 UTC,"Just make a friggin DS shaped smartphone... a clam shell design would be the shit.   Keep the dual screen ... maybe make the whole thing a big bigger for bigger screens... but leave plenty of bezel for buttons and something to grab and keep it not so fucking fragile.  Here's why a dual screen clam shell smartphone would be the shit:    The camera.  Just hold it like you are playing the DS... and camera is on back of top section.....  It would be just about 1000x more convenient to use when shooting pics than a smartphones.      None of this hold edges with one hand akwardly.. then ""tap"" to take a pic ... Instead u can take one handed photos with the convenience of a handgun :P   With the hinge it would be extremely easy to slightly adjust angles and see what you are shooting on the screens.    Even better set that fucker down on something and adjust away...instant stabilization system, no need for BS accesories.     Even better allow the top section to rotate ala "" 2 in 1s "" .... and now u have seriously nice options for adjusting the camera position ever so slightly... and leaving it stable... and the image preview will show up on the bottom screen."
interestingasfuck,3dtott,niggytardust2000,12,Sun Jul 19 14:17:52 2015 UTC,But how would you hold it for taking phone calls?  Seems like that part would be super awkward with a clamshell.
interestingasfuck,3dtott,yooman,17,Sun Jul 19 14:30:54 2015 UTC,When shut maybe?
interestingasfuck,3dtott,MidgarZolom,6,Sun Jul 19 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"Simple. You make it really thin and narrow, while maintaining the clamshell flip functionality. Eliminate the second screen to save on battery life, and replace it with a set of physical buttons for input on the remaining top screen. Maybe put a digital clock on the outside of the clamshell, so that you can easily check the time without opening the phone. Boom."
interestingasfuck,3dtott,fifthpilgrim,13,Sun Jul 19 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"So basically, and LGVX 9900? Or an ENV?"

interestingasfuck,3dtott,Twinkling82,3,Sun Jul 19 18:11:08 2015 UTC,"So, there's a built in battery, memory, and camera, but the battery would extend the life of, or recharge, the phone. So you can use the  apps it has on internal drive, and the camera. The memory would let you access apps that you have downloaded on it, and it will run on the internal battery. The extra camera would make it 3D, but would run on the internal battery.  That seems like a good description. I think this would be cool."
interestingasfuck,3dtott,PenguinsRAwesome,16,Sun Jul 19 20:49:10 2015 UTC,I'd buy one except a phone that cool would not even make it to Sprint :(

interestingasfuck,3dtott,snailshoe,4,Sun Jul 19 18:04:28 2015 UTC,Except with that logic it would cost less than others because nintendo consoles always do
interestingasfuck,3dtott,HumbleManatee,27,Sun Jul 19 18:40:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't buy it.
interestingasfuck,3dtott,minimalillusions,82,Sun Jul 19 13:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's precisely what we need, another ""innovative"" smartphone.

interestingasfuck,3dtott,HeavyHDx,38,Sun Jul 19 13:22:16 2015 UTC,"That's not what would happen at all, at least not to the point of no one buying Nintendo hardware anymore."
interestingasfuck,3dtott,keanex,19,Sun Jul 19 13:49:29 2015 UTC,They wouldn't put Android on that.

It's probably better to just leave everything the way it is and not release the games on other platforms, even if I wouldn't want anything more."

interestingasfuck,3dtott,InvincibleAgent,3,Sun Jul 19 14:08:56 2015 UTC,Unless they made their own OS. Then they would not have to release the games for android.
interestingasfuck,3dtott,30sebastian0198,3,Sun Jul 19 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"Considering that they have always made their own OS for every piece of hardware they've released, I wouldn't be surprised in the least.   Don't kill me if someone finds a reference to them getting assistance with building an OS at some point in their history."
interestingasfuck,3dtott,zehkaiser,5,Sun Jul 19 16:35:44 2015 UTC,I don't think Nintendo would make the control pad a separate piece. They'd find a way to make it a slide out. Sony already did it with their gaming phone.

interestingasfuck,3dtott,The_Wayward_Vagabond,2,Sun Jul 19 14:18:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I loved mine. The internals eventually died from overuse haha. The specs were definitely the reason it didn't sell too well. It just wasn't powerful enough to compete with the true flagships even at the time. Having a single-core processor in a phone directed toward gaming whenever dual-cores were already on the market was dumb on Sony's part.

I'd highly recommend going, but not for completely new divers.  That was around my 25th dive and was very nerve wracking for me."

interestingasfuck,3dtvet,willardfillmore,6,Sun Jul 19 13:04:59 2015 UTC,"It's still very much a job. Geographic Information Systems is more or less what the field is called now, but it's awesome. They map all kinds of data as long as it has a location and can be represented as a point, line, or polygon. It is very important to the decision making process for companies and governments. However, it's less about making the map itself (landforms), and more about displaying data as it relates to the surrounding geography.   Source: took some classes in college.  Edit:spelling and I want to add that I'd like to go back to get my masters in something GIS related even though I just minored in it."

Looking at the Bureau of Justice Statistics Criminal Victimization report for the same year, approximately 337,960 gun attacks (I am presuming that both numbers include rapes/sexual assaults, robberies, and simple assaults, which appears to be the case at first glance). As the population of the UK is listed as approximately 62,641,000 and the USA is 311,591,517, we get approximately .0021 knife attacks per capita in the UK and .0011 knife attacks per capita in the USA. Assuming the veracity of all these numbers, then it would be true to say that there are more knife attacks per capita in the UK than gun attacks in the US."

Now that the tech hasn't changed much we're seeing people win medals and championships in their respective action sport from having great technique.   There's people doing unique or new tricks still but it doesn't mean they'll win 1st place. A perfectly executed trick or run nearly always outshines one new trick.   With that said in the future, I'm sure that technique and execution will become even more important in the future as action sports age and be thought of as real sports like baseball, basketball etc."

Freezing, however, dramatically slows the process down."

Most nightshade plants contain tomatin, an alkaloid that works as a fungicide and mild pesticide, which is why you can make pest spray from tomato leaves. Tomatin is completely harmless to humans.  Another plant in the nightshade family, the belladonna, bears a poisonous fruit that is sometimes used in herbal medicine, but can be deadly. This is where the myths come from."

interestingasfuck,3donbg,MINECRAFT_BIOLOGIST,4,Sat Jul 18 08:37:25 2015 UTC,"Poorly paraphrased Wikipedia:  Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as glycoalkaloids, which are concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits. Poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely, and most cases involve eating green potatoes or drinking potato-leaf tea.  Leaves, stems, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant contain small amounts of the toxic alkaloids tomatine and solanine. Levels in foliage and green fruit are generally too small to be dangerous unless large amounts are consumed, however the use of tomato leaves in herbal tea has been responsible for at least one death. Small amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring without ill effect. Compared to potatoes the amount of solanine in green or ripe tomatoes is low.  /  Tomatine is toxic to humans in high enough amounts, Tomato and potato leaves & stems are maybe 90% edible. Other members of the genus solanum familiar to me, solanum nigrum and solanum aviculare, are toxic except for ripe fruits, so toxicity is definitely not a myth."

interestingasfuck,3donbg,hybroid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:46:58 2015 UTC,I am growing this as well. They were selling it in a pot at Home Depot a garden center and after reading the description I bought it and planted it with my other tomato plants. No yield yet though.
interestingasfuck,3donbg,AnActualRock,3,Sat Jul 18 12:02:22 2015 UTC,"I believe anything is possible, but HD should not have had access to this graft in the USA-- it is the first year of its US availability and responsible growers are checking to see how the thing actually DOES in various parts of the country before starting mass production. I work at a large garden center that grows our own plant material and we received 5 individual plants to try. This means growing each in whiskey barrels and sending back information about yield & size. Mine is currently loaded with green fruit. If you really do have a K&F, you will notice that the tag has no information about plant size or # of days to harvest... because they legit don't quite know what it will do here yet. Our supplier said to anticipate a plant 6-8' tall. I would be very, very interested to know how a HD supplier acquired enough to sell to HD and how it could possibly have been profitable for them to do so (grafted veg are very pricey to grow). I've heard of one consumer who bought one from another garden center in our state, apparently because they sold their sample plants by accident. Should be readily avail nationally within 2-3 years and grafted vegetable plants are generally at least $10 retail."
interestingasfuck,3donbg,MonsteraDeliciosa,2,Sat Jul 18 14:35:01 2015 UTC,My dad actually bought it. I just verified with him. He bought it from a garden center/florist NEXT to Home Depot for $17. Sorry for the inaccurate initial comment; i edited it.

It seems to me that if you have to unroot the thing and kill it to harvest the potatoes, it's less efficient than just regular old tomato farming...  edit: Upon second thought....this WOULD be a nice way to get some extra tomatoes out of a potato farm that would already be uprooting the potatoes as soon as they were done..."
interestingasfuck,3donbg,huott,22,Sat Jul 18 07:41:45 2015 UTC,The process of grafting the tomato to the potato rootstock is prohibitively expensive for farming purposes. It's a curiosity that home gardeners may try once or twice. I don't see it taking off to any great degree

Ah, who am i kidding? I know the exact episode and exactly what happened. In the episode ""I, Borg"" they found a stranded Borg and put him in captivity. Eventually they designed an ""impossible"" image that, due to the analytical nature of the Borg, would cause them to effectively get stuck in a logic loop and overload. But over the course of time and by being away from reddit the Borg hive mind, the captured Borg started to develop a sense of individuality when speaking with crew members who then started to become affectionate towards and end up calling him Hugh. Picard, previously having survived being almost fully assimilated by the Borg, decided to have an intense interrogation with this Borg in an attempt to trick him into thinking Picard is still Lucius Locutus and needs help assimilating the humans. The Borg refused and identified as Hugh and said ""I"" instead of ""we"".  Picard now faces a moral and ethical dilemma to either use the Borg to transmit the impossible image to destroy the Borg or risk this golden opportunity to have a chance at delivering a sense of individuality to the Borg. In the end, they decide not to destroy the Borg and Hugh is dropped back off where he was found and is collected by the Borg. Just when you think Hugh is lost to the hive mind, he turns and acknowledges the crew members indicating he retained his sense of self.    sigh    Edit: Fuck me, I guess I wrote this when I was absolutely baked last night. I'm surprised I remembered that much detail about this episode..."

Obviously they work with varying levels of effectiveness.  It's been theorized that humor serves this purpose in humans.

interestingasfuck,3dmvkz,Wildhalcyon,5,Sat Jul 18 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"Not in this case. With most typical punchline-jokes, where there's a thing to figure out and laugh at (as opposed to absurdist humor, where the joke is that there is no logic), the joke is funny because you and the teller share a moment where you each understand that eachother knowns the ""encrypted"" message within.  People speculate that this type of humor evolved as a way to encourage humans to sortof broadcast information, and develop friendships with people who think and understand them well. To continue the theme of computer analogies, humans evolved to like looking for other people who share the same encryption algorithms, and to find joy in understanding new ones.  This is called the encryption theory of humor (paper, pdf)   In this theory, the joke isn't funny when it's explained because you are not doing the decryption yourself, and are not sharing in that excitement of decoding hidden, shared knowledge."

They make a home in the sea bed.    They go out and catch pray, then drag it back to the entrance of their home.  Then they leave the pray, go into their home and check it, come back out and drag the food into their home.  If a human intervenes and pulls the food slightly away from the entrance while the octopus is inside, the octopus will seem to start the process from scratch.  It pulls the food back to the entrance, then goes back inside to check its home.  If the human keeps pulling the food slightly away while it is inside, it will just keep going around that loop until it starves to death."

Wasps have very limited programming that can appear complex, but are really just hardcoded decision trees.  Telemarketers have the same issue.  EDIT (LONG):  Found the source I was thinking of: The behavior patterns of the Sphex wasp:   ...[T]he wasp Sphex builds a burrow for the purpose and seeks a cricket which she stings in such a way as to paralyze butnot kill it. She drags the cricket into the burrow, lays her eggs alongside, closes the burrow, then flies away, never to return. ... [T]he wasp’s routine is to bring the paralyzed cricket to the burrow, leave it on the threshold, go inside to see that all is well, emerge, and then drag the cricket in. If, while the wasp is inside making her preliminary inspection,the cricket is moved a few inches away, the wasp, on emerging from the burrow, will bring the cricket back to the threshold, but not inside, and will then repeat the preparatory procedure of entering the burrow to see that everything is all right.   From a 1963 paper by Woolridge, popularized by Dennet and Hofstadter. It has since been thoroughly debunked, but keeps sticking around due to how useful it is to describe Fixed Behavior Patterns and emergent complex behaviors.  For more info, read The Sphex  story: How the cognitive sciences kept repeating an old and questionable anecdote  TL;DR: I'm right and wrong"

Imagine if you took a show about Guinness world records and had a comedian interact with a given topic, with a touch of Punk'd and Jackass. In Japan, the B and C-tier (even D-tier) celebrities are much more prevalent, and make up a huge majority of talk/gameshows, but since it's a homogenous society, everyone recognizes everyone, and because the competition to stay relevant is so cutthroat, producers can pay pennies to send desperate comedic talents to ridiculous situations. In slightly twisted logic, most A-list (especially musicians/actors) celebrities aren't okay to mess with, but because there's so much willing talent to get pranked/messed with, this sort of thing is viewable on a daily basis."

interestingasfuck,3dlhdf,Margate_Mod,73,Fri Jul 17 18:09:46 2015 UTC,Ugliness usually comes from not writing the same letter identical to each other. I did this about 15 years ago with my handwriting and the font looks a lot better than my actual handwriting.

No more social life means no more people around to say ""Hey, I'm worried about you.""   I'm not saying your wife is ""abusive"" but all behaviour lies on a spectrum, and this is at least a little manipulative/controlling if she is genuinely cutting you off from your friends.

If you use InDesign you change the font to kern optically and it fixes most of the issues. Then anything else is pretty easy to fix after that. But that doesn't really help the people who will be using Word to make their ads and stuff. I'm sure it will all just look like a minutely slightly better option than comic sans or something!

interestingasfuck,3dlhdf,fanboat,7,Fri Jul 17 10:10:32 2015 UTC,"I played around with the idea of a ""handwritten"" font in my head a few years ago. The thing that bothered me most about was the fact when you write, it's never uniform. Lots of people unintentionally connect their writing. In a non-formal situation, it wouldn't work.   While it might work for a formal situation, even then it wouldn't be a viable replacement for a hand written report. Mostly due the obvious perfect lining without lines on a printed paper, even with lines added. The sheen of the printer ink, or laser printer.  Again, cursive writing is taken out, as there is no perfect way to link every letter from the same 2 points, beginning and end.  The only practical would be fun to show people, as shown in the gif.  That's to say, it's a great idea nonetheless."

While the method shown will produce a heavily degraded copy of the original grooves, and may even result in a ""playable"" record, this is being done here because it looks cool, and not because it was ever considered a practical way to copy a record.  The headline stating that this is ""how music piracy worked"" is fanciful at best and should not be taken as a factual description.  The vinyl LP heyday from the 50s-80s coincided with wide availability of consumer tape recording, it would have been far cheaper and easier to make a tape.    To say nothing of which it almost certainly would have been cheaper just to buy another copy of the original record than attempt to make reproductions in this way.  Bootleg records were (and still are) made, but overwhelmingly came from actual, legitmate pressing plants.  I have a bootleg copy of David Bowie's third album that is almost more common that the original pressing - in the late 70s, some shady group decided to profit off his increased profile by having copies pressed from a cassette tape of the original record.  It sounds terrible, but only due to the bad quality of the source - it was still pressed and printed by legitimate manufacturers back in the day."

Acetates are generally shorter duration (10""), heavier (laquer on a metal plate), and lower quality than 33 RPM pressed records; the blanks would be more expensive than an actual record even before you cut them, and then you have to sit there cutting them in real time, one copy at a time.  And the resulting copies can only be played a handful of times before breaking down.  The implication of ""bootleg"" is that you end up with a product that would fool somebody into thinking it was the real thing, and an acetate cutter will not do that.  There are labels who will do limited run acetates today just for shits and giggles, but they for the most part way more expensive to make in terms time and investment than a comparable mass-produced run."

I looked into the possibility of 3d printing records because damn they're expensive but the quality was not great at all from what I found. I wouldn't expect just pouring some liquid and peeling it off by a human would be any better than a computer.
interestingasfuck,3dif3o,Zombies_Are_Dead,74,Thu Jul 16 23:20:24 2015 UTC,They were horrible sounding and the material was sub-par. I have a bootleg Dark Side of the Moon album and it is warped to all hell even though it's been stored the same as all the other albums.
interestingasfuck,3dif3o,sprucenoose,16,Thu Jul 16 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"Well I think the step they are missing here is that the should have created a master from the mold, cleaned that up as much as possible, then created better molds and pressed copies from those. With the materials you would need to use to get the mold from the original and then whatever you poured into that mold, I imagine they would have to be pretty unsuitable for long term storage and quality."

interestingasfuck,3dif3o,lumu2015,2,Fri Jul 17 06:30:43 2015 UTC,it is somewhat of a miracle. i was actually wondering the same thing. The sound was actually pretty good. There is a diamond tipped needle that reads the audio from the grooves. the record player amplifies it.  it was always a drag when you broke a needle because they were expensive...I remember riding my bike down to the  mom and pop record shop to buy needles.  damn...you'd think i grew up in the 50s.
interestingasfuck,3dif3o,Mr-Platypus,3,Thu Jul 16 23:38:16 2015 UTC,Omg. I actually remember having a red record when I was little. Now I know why it was different.
interestingasfuck,3dif3o,cunningcolt,2,Fri Jul 17 09:17:14 2015 UTC,Do you need the red part or does that just make it look nice?
interestingasfuck,3dif3o,Brickhows,5,Fri Jul 17 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"Yes because the grey is opposite of a record. Instead of valleys where they stylus plays it has ridges but keeps all of the nooks of each so creating a copy of it that you can then pour a moldable liquid over it that once hardened will create the valleys that you need to play it. Basically the process is you take the record, create an ""inverse record"" and then you can create the bootleg record. its like copying a ceramic, think of the Grey part as the mold of the record you ultimately want a bootleg of."
interestingasfuck,3dif3o,eesperan,3,Thu Jul 16 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"I'm really curious as to how the mold itself sounds when put on a record player, with everything ""backwards"""
interestingasfuck,3dif3o,Brickhows,5,Thu Jul 16 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"A stylus can't track on the ridges, so it'd just bump all over the place and sound like a needle being dragged all over."
interestingasfuck,3dif3o,eesperan,6,Thu Jul 16 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"Well where there are ridges in the original record, there would now be grooves, so just start the track there."

If you invert those, you would have very wide grooves with flat bottoms.  It's unlikely you'd be able to get any coherent sound out of that."

interestingasfuck,3dif3o,ophello,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"It would be more inverted than backwards, same idea as with a negative of a photo. It would be interesting since the valleys (where the music is at) become the ridges and the smooth ridges be comes the valleys but the stylus would still pick up most what it would when the correct way since most of it is more on the sides than the actual floor of the valley. (I could be wrong on this. It is simply an assumption on my part.)"

A stylus runs through the groove, and as it passes through that wave form, it moves around. These movements are picked up by tiny electromagnets which induce audio signals into some wiring which eventually makes its way to an amplifier. Somewhat similar to how a microphone works."

interestingasfuck,3dif3o,vitruv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"this would probably work fine with a much better understanding of the materials and the interface between them. The record would need to be cleaned very thoroughly (the needle of the player can move debris, but here it would be fixed in place).  Ideally I'd think you would deposit a very thin layer of lubricant, and then a very low surface tension cement which really fills in the grooves, and then a silicone layer to add pressure and structure. Press until dry."

It sounds crazy I know, but he sort of likes me and we have a rhythm to life, but he never sees the need for being lovingly and kindly assisted despite knowing him since he was a kitten and him knowing how I try to communicate with him.   He always wants to try to dominate as his only known way to interact unless there is an object like food or a toy.   The girl cat understand the hand signals I give before stroking her fur, making many signs for treats after she hears the bath waters being drawn and knows it will be time for a bath and she is richly rewarded.   I focus on them nicely and treat them like individuals. I am not a crazy cat lady, I just know they are tiny intelligences, and not only stupid animals nor tiny people, but social symbiosis and limited cross species communication can be achieved.  Mr Derpy is too much of an insecure scrapper to comprehend, but he knows when bedtime is and wants to cuddle on his terms.

interestingasfuck,3diqul,Lulwafahd,8,Fri Jul 17 04:00:18 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a job for some fun. Because what happens next will not be fun for either of you. Best just call it fun and pretend it is.   If he ever goes outside the litterbox, complains more often, vomits on the floor, or acts like a terror you must stop. You're stressing him out and he does not want it.  How big is his bubble? We need to pop it or, at least, shrink it a little. Next time you see him laying in his spot tomorrow I want you to lay down next to him as close as you can. Bring two things with you, a treat and thick gloves.   If you don't have gloves, I suggest thick wool socks if you have any. If you don't have treats, then you shouldn't have cats.   Do not keep eye contact. Lock sights, give him a look that suggests that he will not win his battles, and pretend you are interested in something else. Just be certain he doesn't make a sneak attack.  Now that he's uncomfortable, put a treat down. Make him get up for it a little and come closer to you, maybe an inch or two. Do not move. Let him finish his snack.   Here we have two outcomes. He lays back down or he leaves. If he bolts, let him and try it again in an hour until he does relax. If he relaxes, move a little closer. Keep the gloves on, he may not like that.  Everyone still have all their blood in? Good. Repeat the steps. Treat, wait, move, etc. If he fights, leave him alone for the day. Keep this going for a little while until you can touch him without serious injury. Start by sliding your hand along the floor slowly to let him get the hint. Work your way up. Expect to be bitten or put in a death lock. Put up with it and let him kill your hand. You'll know if you need better gloves at this point.   Now that the two of you can relax without starting a war, you get to move to the next step. This one can be a little tricky. You are going to need the treat and gloves again with the addition of a coat or a towel.  Glove up with your dominate hand, put the coat over the other arm or wrap it up with the towel and put a glove on that hand. You are now ready to attempt cuddling. If your cat is as problematic as you say, you may want to invest in kevlar.  This time you have to make eye contact, but not in the way you expect and not right away.   We pick up where we left off. He lays down, you lay down. Attempt to put your arm over his head. Make it slow and deliberate. Again, let him run if he wants and wait a day if he fights. At some point you might be able to make it to his scruff. Make no attempt to grab it yet. Just keep your arm out and your hand on him until he gets up.   Give him a treat for a job well done.  While you are reaching your arm out, talk to him and keep eye contact. You should be closing and opening your eyes very slowly. Don't stare him down. He will think you want to fight.  Try changing it up a few times. Try putting your hand underneath his head. They don't all go for this, but mine certainly love the combo of a good ear scratch and pressing their faces against my hand.   The next step is hardly one. From here you get to try making him the little spoon instead of facing him. Talk to him and promise him a treat and basically get as close to him as you can while trying to pet him. Treat him and take the same cautionary advise as before. There is no good way that I've found of making this work. Just do your best.  If you succeed, and I hope you do, you'll only have a few more little tricks to pull. Try step one when he is not relaxing. Try step two by putting a treat on a towel or blanket on the floor. Have him lay on it and cuddle. Try it again without the treat and then again without the towel. Try spooning when he's relaxing.  Here comes the last step. Swaddling. Get him on the towel with the treat. Start out like you are getting ready to cuddle from either side of him. As he relaxes, pull the towel up fast around him. He probably won't like this as much as you think which, as I understand, is absolutely fucking not. So that plus 10.   Make sure that his hind legs are trapped. He will wiggle and squirm and complain, but don't let that stop you now. You are making him your bitch and he has to know it. Before you were his pet. Then he thought of you as a pleasure. Now he knows where his place is. Underneath your kind heart and your hard heel. Don't crush him, but keep a firm grip while talking to him sweetly. You lose if he gets his hind legs out to kick you. Pet him heavily and scruff him as best you can.   He will basically turn into your little furry burrito after a few more of these swaddling sessions. They don't like it, but they don't put up much of a fight after a while. You just have to break them on this.  You should, at least, be ready to scruff him now. Trimming his nails will be easy now. All you need to do is swaddle and go. You can let him get a hind leg out one at a time to be safe while trimming those paws. Bathing will be easier if you've learned how to bath with one hand like I have. I can help you out there if you get to that point.  I mentioned that you should stop if you stress him out. You still need to bath and trim him, though. This is where you'll actually need to enlist. Buy an extra pair of gloves and get a friend wearing long sleeves over, because there will be blood.   We skip all the steps and go straight to breaking him when he needs his toes trimmed. If you thought he might fight like a bastard five times his size before... well... Prepare to be amazed. You are going to need full protection. Swaddle him up and have your friend hold him down. You get the fun task of pulling your hellbeast's paws out and trimming them while he is actively trying to murder you.   Bathing is even better. Seriously, you'll love this. Gear up and put a rain coat on. You are about to get wet. Do not draw the bath. He's going to be mad enough, you don't want him to be ready for it too. We go back to the swaddle and letting your friend hold him. We walk him very carefully to the bathtub or sink where you give them baths.   This part happens in an instant, so do not take your eye off him. You don't want a killer on the loose. Turn on the water, get the shampoo bottle open, and grab the cat whole from the swaddle as fast as you can, and push him under the water. No matter how it turns out you'll probably do a little bit of bleeding. Keep him down and scruff him hard. Hard as you can muster. Your friend gets the easy job of shampooing while you keep your little monster under the water.   Do not lose your grip.   Do not lose your grip.   Do not lose your grip.   Do not lose your grip.   Do not lose your grip.   When your cat is properly clean, have your friend turn off the water and pick up the towel. The most difficult part is coming up. You get to pick up a soaking wet and angry cat and push it into the towel for a second swaddle. He might pee into the towel a little, or on you or your friend. Keep him in there until you think he's dry enough and let go. You may have to do a little running and do not expect to see your warrior for the rest of the day. He hates you.  So, there you have it. Good luck, have the local ER's number handy, and make friends with someone of low intelligence or a high pain threshold.   tl;dr: Give up. You already lost."

Poor fat bastard (12 US pounds) serious acts like he has C-PTSD whenever he isn't asleep or something.  One of his incisors is chipped since years ago, and wouldn't you know it that dullard draws blood best with that tooth.  I think what's worst is that he growls for over an hour while swaddled. Fat bastard can really nurse a grudge."
interestingasfuck,3diqul,Lulwafahd,3,Fri Jul 17 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"Hah. You may need to try an alternative tactic, then. This one is much simpler.   If he wants something he doesn't need, ignore him. He'll probably act out a little bit but keep it up. Reward him but never punish him too much.   Play with him more often. Some use toys, but I prefer actual contact and have the scars to show for it. Play pat-a-cake while he's on his back to kill. Let him death lock you but make sure he knows when it hurts by bopping him on the nose.  Wear him out with constant attention. My cat Spoticus loves a good fight and cuddle."

interestingasfuck,3diqul,Jagermeister4,58,Thu Jul 16 17:53:20 2015 UTC,Shouldn't be.  It is basically activating the same spot on the cat where their mother use to carry them around.  I'm sure they have a natural reaction to not move while mommy is taking them with her.
interestingasfuck,3diqul,WreckerCrew,60,Thu Jul 16 18:17:53 2015 UTC,"Scruffing is not safe if done by a complete novice under the gist that it's some kind of a universal off switch. It can harm the neck severely. It is however possible to do it safely if done gently and loosely, particularly if the cat reacts positively.  More on this is available in the clinical textbook for veterinary technicians, just to quote some source on the matter. Plenty more is available through Google, including conflicting hypotheses."

You should also try to get your dog used to touching their feet.  My advice since you're already in this situation, go exercise your dog as much as you can so that the dog is tired and try it then.  Try touching your dogs feet as much as possible when they are sleepy or half asleep.  You need them to get used to the idea that you're going to touch their feet."

interestingasfuck,3dl2ez,NickRivieraPhD,28,Fri Jul 17 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"Virtually all creation myths trace back to some kind of serpent or snake, usually embodying evil, usually in some kind of conflict with god(s). Often the conflict is ongoing, the end of which will bring about the end of the world. The seeming universality of the archtype could trace back to oral tradition prior to man's emmigration from Africa. China, Mesopotamia, Norse, Mesoamerica all have eerily similar mythologies which originate with a serpent or snake, and all emerged seemingly independently. For 1 of many thousands of Egyptian reliefs to look similar to a Mayan relief is not evidence of anything. The image on the left is of a lost artifact which was one of many gifts allegedly given by a mysterious, lost indigenous people to a mysterious priest while on a clandestine expedition in South America (after extensive expeditioning in mesopotamia). The artifacts the priest claims the tribe gave to him are now ""lost"". The tribe is also ""lost"". In other words, it's bullshit. Sun worship appears in some form or another in most early beliefs. So even if this weren't another ""lost"" artifact from the above  priest's hoax, it wouldn't be too unheard of. If he'd made a little more of an effort to make it less of an exact copy of Egyptian style (the sun disk doesn't quite cut it), it might actually have been convincing as authentic. But would still not be evidence of anything beyond early peoples worshipped the giant ball of fire in the sky.  Similar to #1, what we call ""Orion's Belt"" was majorly significant to virtually all ancient civilizations with (and even without) advanced knowledge of astronomy. Or at least capabilities to look up at night and see 3 fucking bright stars in a row. When ancients had their entire civilization dragging massive rocks across the world for generations, they wanted to make sure the rocks ended up arranged in a meaningful way. Equinoxes and Orion's Belt were the faves.    There are striking common elements in early belief systems. But it says more about how humans perceived and explained the world. And perhaps a common oral tradition. We now have genetic evidence that the number of modern humans dropped from probably around a million to at most 6 thousand after a catastrophic extinction event. Some say it could have been as few as a single population who survived, are the ancestors on all 7 billion of us, and may have kernels of their oral tradition surviving to this day."

interestingasfuck,3dl2ez,demontaoist,3,Fri Jul 17 10:06:48 2015 UTC,I remember coming across these scattered theories over time. None of them are conclusive. At best they offer interesting ideas that encourage further study in an area that has very little interest. One of those things that the professional researcher would say 'there is no evidence of...' but that is only because no one has asked the question. Should someone ask the right questions some of these theories would undoubtedly fall apart.  As best as i can compile here are a few:  Ancient Chinese reached America on at least 2 centuries apart expeditions. They are the original Americans or took over most cultures - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20932396-asiatic-father-s-of-america  Chinese Visited in 1400's prior to Columbus - http://www.gavinmenzies.net/america-book/about-who-discovered-america/  Wikipedia has a page - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_contact_theories  Olmec Heads get a lot of attention - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec  There's one about an Islamic prince in Mali who left on an expedition to the new world in the 1300's. His people were close to the...Nubians I believe who were still close to Egyptian culture. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_I_of_Mali  There are some others or at least those who speculate on evidence 'that can only prove pre-Columbian contact.' The Wikipedia page captures some of these. I know this post was originally about how Egypt and Ecuador could be similar and I have merely presented how contact could have been made.   It would be very difficult to conclusively make that connection since it is anathema to even consider pre-Columbian contact as a possibility.

But there's no evidence in artifacts. Crossings would have happened before civilizations as we define them existed, and the people who may have crossed were all very isolated.  If there was trade between the new world and the old before Columbus, there would be records, and very concrete evidence. It never happened."
interestingasfuck,3dl2ez,PrometheusDarko,3,Sat Jul 18 03:42:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if various cultures did in fact base the layout of their pyramids on Orion's Belt. But for no other reason that to base it off a constellation that many cultures loved, and several used for time keeping.  Humans love doing stuff like that, it's just what we do. No hidden meaning just some contractor in whatever BC gong, ""You know those three stars we love? Let's make the pyramids in that shape. People do bigger things for dumber reasons. Don't even get me started on the fucked up reasons entire wars have been started."
interestingasfuck,3dl2ez,RadioIsMyFriend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying but that doesn't really explain the similarity. Sure Orion's belt played a role in watching the stars and time keeping, etc. but a lot of stars and constellations were being watched and we weren't as a species making pyramids based on the north star or the seven sisters. It's really only laid out like pyramids are made three in a row like Orion's belt and tgat gets into a broader question of WHY do we equate pyramids to Orion's belt almost exclusively."
interestingasfuck,3dl2ez,NathanGillett,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:15:02 2015 UTC,"However, not all pyramids are laid out like the three kings, either. It's a case of all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. For every case of pyramids laid out like the three kings, there are at least two cases of pyramids laid out in a different layout. Humans love patterns.  Take domestication for example. Across the globe, humans started attempting to domesticate animals and plants rather than continuing to live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. It didn't all happen at exactly the same time, but the theme exists. Animal and human hybrids (usually deities) was another theme across multiple cultures.  We only have so much inspiration to draw from it's not unlikely that more than one planner drew inspiration from the three kings for a layout. And I wouldn't be surprised if at least one of these three examples listed was purely coincidence.  Occam's razor states that the hypothesis which requires the fewest assumptions should be selected. We know that humans enjoy copying things in nature, it's how we learn and get many of our ideas. The Three Kings is a steady constellation in the night sky.  It's both my SOs and my favorite constellation, but that doesn't mean it holds any kind of significance beyond us both happening to like it. That's just how the law of large numbers works. Occasionally things will appear to line up, when in reality it's coincidence."

The same principle also applies for the analogy: why major security corporations and other ""paranoid"" businesses/institutes have keypads, ocular scanners, and other security measures for critically-sensitive sectors rather than just a key to unlock the door.  If you're truly paranoid about the security of your password, make it long and easily memorable, then add complexity with special characters.

Place the now empty tube on the edge of the table and pinch it so that it has backspin coming off the table. It will shoot forward and the spin will give it lift.

interestingasfuck,3di571,Derp-Boy,2,Thu Jul 16 18:03:58 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly from the Encroma site.  Colorblindness is caused by more than one color receptor in your eye triggering for a single color.  Normal eyes have several different receptors depending on the wavelength.   Colorblind Eyes these receptors overlap.  So the red receptor reacts to a some of the green, and the green receptor reacts to some of the red.   What Encroma does is filter out the wavelengths between the two receptor types so that you don't have both firing.  So the short answer is he probably saw Purple = Blue + Red + Green = Brown.  The glasses stopped the green receptor from firing and now it looks cool."

interestingasfuck,3di571,whitesombrero,3,Thu Jul 16 19:14:22 2015 UTC,These glasses actually work by letting the user see fewer colors so probably not anytime soon.  It blocks wavelengths that were causing things to appear red+green at the same time.

A rifle will certainly be more deadly than a pistol regarding the ballistics of a round, even if they both fire the same caliber/cartridge. The length of the barrel (and to some degree twist in the rifling) will improve the ballistics of the round.   That being said, the .223 was designed as a varmint bullet (I.e. very small creatures.) and isn't very well suited to killing larger animals. (Though there is a military variant in the NATO 5.56x45 round.)

You can just hit it directly into the pocket.  If the object ball was sitting exactly on the focus, then I guess hitting it in with the cue ball would be fairly easy since all you have to do is control the speed of the shot because every angle should lead to the hole.  However, saying that it is substantially more likely to result in making the ball than any other spot is just utterly and completely wrong.

Of course you could just knock the ball in without a bounce from anywhere, but that fact is not unique to this table.  What is unique is that, when shooting one ball off a wall into the pocket, one spot (without aiming) assures you will either get it or be very close, while all other spots (without aiming) almost guarantee a miss.  That's cool. It's a cool thing about an ellipse.  But if you insist on talking about using a cue ball to hit another ball in, it's still pretty cool that you can work out the needed angle by needing to hit the object ball so that it's new path appears to have run through the origin.

interestingasfuck,3dgs31,GallowBoob,19,Thu Jul 16 03:45:02 2015 UTC,"If you were stuck, it would be dangerous to lift your foot and break form."
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,ploppedmenacingly,11,Thu Jul 16 04:18:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If anything, it should operate by lifting your toes instead of raising your foot and depressing a pedal."
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,NirvashPrime,2,Thu Jul 16 04:32:11 2015 UTC,Why not just use a smith machine?
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,GrammatonYHWH,13,Thu Jul 16 10:22:12 2015 UTC,"Why not just use a smith   Because they blow donkey shit. Barbell will help you gain more muscle. dumbbell will help you even more. The less stabilized the lift, the surprisingly better the workout. (To a certain extent)"
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,J_lovin,6,Thu Jul 16 13:20:20 2015 UTC,"No, I mean why not use a smith machine if you don't have a spotter instead of this reclining bench thing."
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,GrammatonYHWH,4,Thu Jul 16 14:07:24 2015 UTC,What he said still applies.
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,colewilco,7,Thu Jul 16 14:14:23 2015 UTC,Except it doesn't because the smith machine doesn't run the risk of crushing your neck while you fiddle trying to hit a peddle.
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,GrammatonYHWH,4,Thu Jul 16 14:15:29 2015 UTC,"Because the smith machine is still a piece of shit machine.  A proper bench isn't straight up and down, the barbell moves with a slight arch. The smith machine only goes up and down so you're essentially doing a fucked up bench. Not to mention it completely eliminates the need for stabilizers so that fucks you as well.  It is actually better to just not bench than use a smith machine."
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,Fudgms,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:56:10 2015 UTC,He said because the workout isn't as good. Reading comprehension bud.

interestingasfuck,3dgs31,bury_the_boy,2,Thu Jul 16 17:50:39 2015 UTC,"...no it wouldnt.  If you break form, congrats you went from an arched bench to a flat bench. Both are legitimate exercises. The only danger is if you're benching 300+ pounds without a spotter and if you are advanced enough to pull that kind of weight you either 1. know your limits or 2. have a spotter.  If you're too stupid to have that truly be an issue you deserve your sternum breaking because the hard way is the only way you will learn."
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,Fudgms,-5,Thu Jul 16 05:32:54 2015 UTC,"If you can do 300+, and you are smart, oh wait that isn't possible. But if you could do that and would be smart, you would use a chain suspension system that would help you without the need of a spotter."
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,DAT_SAT,2,Thu Jul 16 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"Did you just say benching 300+ pounds isn't possible or it isn't possible to bench 300 and be smart?  Also all you need is either a spotter, no clips on the bar, or one of the benches with the rails on the side that will catch it.  Source: I bench a lot completely alone in my gym."

interestingasfuck,3dgs31,jat0369,0,Thu Jul 16 15:37:28 2015 UTC,There is no form to break on the bench. You would go from an arched to a flat bench.
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,Fudgms,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:33:32 2015 UTC,But it doesn't help with the initial push up.
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,DAT_SAT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:06:12 2015 UTC,It is meant more for after you do ten reps and can't bring forth the energy to put it back.
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,zw1ck,0,Thu Jul 16 18:02:56 2015 UTC,What is if the weight is higher than you can push up? So for a delta exercise?  In that kind of exercise you can't push the weight up but you just lower the weight down. Studies have shown that this kind of exercise can be very effective.
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,DAT_SAT,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"Huh? If you can't push the weight up, you cannot lower it so no movement will happen"
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,Fudgms,0,Thu Jul 16 18:58:26 2015 UTC,So you don't know what delta means. Are you saying that you can only hold or lower weights you can push up? Even that studies just show that you have 30% more muscle grow when doing such an exercise were the lowering weight is higher than the pushing weight?
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,DAT_SAT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"I think you mean deltS for deltoids (see no A) which are the main shoulder muscles.  Also link a study. Negatives have their place, but the delts are a pushing muscle so lowering the weight will get some muscle break down in but it would be significantly more effective to do a pushing motion...because that is literally what they do."
interestingasfuck,3dgs31,Fudgms,0,Thu Jul 16 19:17:59 2015 UTC,"I mean delta like the letter in the Greek alphabet if you know what that is. Here is a link to a article about some machines that allow you to change the weight in the exercise, so you can push one weight and lower a different weight. http://suite101.de/article/kraft-und-ausdauer-mit-dem-milon-zirkeltraining-a81827#.VagKkNIo7qA"
