MakeNewFriendsHere,3e5s8f,GallantNova,2,Wed Jul 22 04:32:13 2015 UTC,"That episode was amazing, but the whole story broke my hearth, specially the end :c One Piece isn't a hobby, is a life commitment! Hope to hear more from you :p"
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e5s8f,GallantNova,2,Wed Jul 22 04:40:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really felt for Stan near the end, feels maaannn. And why wouldn't you hear more from me? Am I dying this soon? Such is life I suppose..."

MakeNewFriendsHere,3e4i5r,marcosgotreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:03:53 2015 UTC,"I've wanted someone to discuss these things with too!    I've found informal groups of friends who like talking about these things, but they often have a tendency to try to one-up one another, each one striving to be perceived as the smartest and most sophisticated."
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e4i5r,philoveritas,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:34:59 2015 UTC,I actually am not really interested in a group bit thank you anyway :)
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e4i5r,philoveritas,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:47:22 2015 UTC,"I think I wasn't clear.  I have participated in groups in the past, but I found I didn't like them because people always tried to top one another.  I don't participate in groups for this reason.  Talking to another person might be a better fit for me.    Since you provided some information in your post title, I'll do the same.  PM me if interested in talking more.  Have a good day!  25 male USA"
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e4i5r,actualsnowman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:51:09 2015 UTC,What kinds of philosophical topics are you interested in discussing?
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e36wz,christina2923,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:02 2015 UTC,The 20s are both the best and worst times ever. Finally get some freedom after school is done where you find more permanent jobs or relationships and get caught up in the everyday groove. Before ya know it that groove can turn into a rut and if you aren't careful can leave you feeling relatively lonely. Mores since your normal field of friends gets pulled away by their own developing lives to new states for work or deeper relationships.  I've been through it all and if you need any advice or would like to vent you know where to find me.
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e36wz,Haven1882,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:40 2015 UTC,"That ""groove"" is a modern day slavery to big banks.  You seem smart so just be research.   Mortgages , loans, insurance.  Just consider what i said please because u can be happy n live a simple life."
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e36wz,beatlejuicex,2,Tue Jul 21 18:04:01 2015 UTC,"I'm in a good place, actually. Despite the big banks. I was trying to be supportive of the OP by explaining about how easy it is to get into a rut."
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e36wz,Haven1882,0,Tue Jul 21 18:11:52 2015 UTC,You did well.  OP needs to be aware of so many subcultures and stuff before giving up to the debt system.
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e36wz,beatlejuicex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"Good to have ya here Christina. And yes, being lonely does suck, but don't you worry. Sent you a PM :)"

MakeNewFriendsHere,3e0z47,GallantNova,2,Tue Jul 21 03:22:40 2015 UTC,"You can be beautiful, GallantNova. I believe in you!"
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e0z47,GallantNova,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:35 2015 UTC,Beautiful? What's that? Is that like being fergalicious? That's still relevant right?
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e0z47,GallantNova,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:35 2015 UTC,"It's the exact same thing, to achieve peak Fergaliciousness you must make all the boys go loco. Thought this was common knowledge, get with the program dude."
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e0z47,GallantNova,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:43 2015 UTC,"Oh right, god can't believe I forgot about that. Though that probably explains all the people that start spelling ""tasty"" and ""delicious"" when they see me. And here I thought I was going loco."
MakeNewFriendsHere,3e0z47,GallantNova,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:55:15 2015 UTC,Are you also g-l-a-m-o-r-o-u-s? That's the important part imo
