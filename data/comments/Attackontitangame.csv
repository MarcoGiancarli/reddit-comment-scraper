Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,is_moo,5,Tue Jul 21 21:34:00 2015 UTC,not just a box.. a mighty box..
Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,Yusuke224,5,Tue Jul 21 19:40:14 2015 UTC,Minecraft for Unity hype?

Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,Clockwork621,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:08 2015 UTC,7 soon.
Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,TNoodler,4,Wed Jul 22 01:51:12 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, I wish I could make boxes :o"
Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,KazeWindfold,4,Tue Jul 21 19:28:04 2015 UTC,is he making a map editor? if only there was one he could conveniently copy
Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,fancyrice,2,Tue Jul 21 23:21:41 2015 UTC,"That's actually a good guess. It looks like he's running the game already within Unity, as you can tell by the move gizmo on the box. The positioning/coordinates thing on the side with 'CM_Box' (I assume refers to centimeter box), seems too convenient to have in the game. Perhaps this is just a test project of his, but it looks ot me like it could very well be a map editor. There's also a sphere in the scene, if that means anything.  Or maybe I'm overthinking it and it's just a damn box. ._."

Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,nikoskio2,4,Tue Jul 21 19:25:44 2015 UTC,Wasn't that already established a few days ago when he posted on his Weibo that he would be updating?
Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,ricardosensei,3,Tue Jul 21 22:44:47 2015 UTC,Oh shush.
Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,Armina-San,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:33:27 2015 UTC,"You sure? I mean, we all say crap about him (with reason) so it's tough to believe he's really doing something. Accelevi said he had promise an update about 3 months ago, after that month and the one after that my hopes had been long gone. I'm just asking because reddit is the only social network I visit so I don't know if it's official."
Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,Xelerot,4,Tue Jul 21 20:23:45 2015 UTC,Accelevi said   well that's where you fucked up
Attackontitangame,3e3vh9,Xelerot,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:26:31 2015 UTC,He posted this on HIS facebook page that only he has control over. It's definitely him.
Attackontitangame,3e1enx,CaptainLechon,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"Aw, that's sad to hear. I saw one of your members in a F3 Hard server a few days ago and figured you guys had started playing again. You guys will still be playing other games together right? Either way good video"

Attackontitangame,3dy7wh,TheTechDweller,2,Mon Jul 20 14:40:19 2015 UTC,This is a bit more difficult than you might think. How much modding experience do you have?   Looking for help?
Attackontitangame,3dy7wh,ZeusAllMighty11,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:45 2015 UTC,Oh I know how hard it's going to be and I don't have any modding experience. I'm looking for any help I can grab. I already have one person who is super willing to help and pretty good with scripts. I know it's such a big project and I will need some more help.

Attackontitangame,3dtxmj,TheTechDweller,2,Sun Jul 19 12:54:22 2015 UTC,How long would this take? Cause if its done right this could be the best thing to happen to this game.
Attackontitangame,3dtxmj,darcnavyseal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:35:36 2015 UTC,I definitely agree. This project will take a very long time. I can't even make an estimate as it's still in the idea stage. There are a few changes that are easy things to add but for the most part things are going to take a long time to make.
Attackontitangame,3dtxmj,sparkie510hieu,2,Mon Jul 20 00:33:24 2015 UTC,That's some project... I'll be open to testing it out though. Sounds like it would be fun
Attackontitangame,3dtxmj,Diabeetush,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:01:46 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a big one but you gotta start somewhere. Testing won't be for a while yet but I'll keep you in mind when we get there.
Attackontitangame,3dtxmj,ninnymonger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"Shit, if I can remember, let me check this out in a year. I'll be competent enough to dedicate some free time as a software developer to aid you on this mod. I really like the idea!"
Attackontitangame,3dtxmj,Tornado76X,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:50:28 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome. I would gladly accept the help. Hopefully in a years time the mod will have become usable in it's basic form. However this will be a growing project constantly expanding so any help would be cool!
Attackontitangame,3dtxmj,Tornado76X,2,Mon Jul 20 13:50:27 2015 UTC,I want to help! Any way I can offer my assistance?
