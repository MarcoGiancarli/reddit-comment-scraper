JapaneseFood,3dx45i,plipyplop,7,Mon Jul 20 07:10:37 2015 UTC,"Recommend not using boiling water.  As stated once on NPR (as well as ""commonly agreed upon"" in other circles): ""Never boil miso because high heat kills the aroma (and, some say, healthful enzymes)""."
JapaneseFood,3dx45i,plipyplop,6,Mon Jul 20 15:29:25 2015 UTC,So it's better to turn the paste into a liquid in the bowl and then add the hot water?
JapaneseFood,3dx45i,HoverhandsMcgee,10,Mon Jul 20 15:55:14 2015 UTC,Yes.  Add your miso paste to 2 Table Spoons of water and mix it until it is nice and uniform.   Then add the rest of the hot water and mix.   It is easier than adding the water all at once and trying to chase the little miso lifeboat around the bowl or having it stick to the bottom and still be difficult.

Traditionally, when you make miso soup, you make a separate dashi stock, and add the miso paste. I guess they're trying to separate the middle man.  This would also be pretty good if you use it as an ingredient, since this is miso + dashi flavor = super umami flavor"
JapaneseFood,3dx45i,n0exit,5,Mon Jul 20 07:07:05 2015 UTC,"I see. That's pretty helpful, is it possible to use in ramen soups or something crazy? I'm not a great cook."

JapaneseFood,3diank,jerichi,5,Mon Jul 20 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"Dairy is used minimally in Japanese food, as are peanuts. I don't believe that much of anything is cooked in peanut oil in Japanese cooking, at least not traditionally, but you might want to steer clear of fried foods (tempura especially) just in case. There is a possibility that Western-style foods might have one of these ingredients (milk is more likely than peanuts, I would imagine), but more Japanese-style food will probably not have either.  From what I know, allergies can be a bit tricky in Japan if you're staying with a native Japanese person, but if you're on your own and are sure to avoid things that might contain your allergens, you'll probably get away with it. It might be a little hard to explain to people at restaurants without a command of Japanese, and even with that sometimes they don't understand very well (allergies aren't as culturally well-understood in Japan). As for shopping on your own, you can probably manage. Ingredients are listed on packaging for food by law I believe so you can check them if you need (ピーナツ = peanut(s), ミルク or 牛乳 [pronounced gyuunyuu] = milk). It might be a good idea to research some common dishes and find things that will be safe before going. There's a wide range of Japanese food and most of it doesn't contain those two items typically so you can probably find things that will be relatively safe.  I'm not really an expert and most of this is based off other people's experiences, but I think it's at least a good starting point!"

JapaneseFood,3cyp5l,BurntCoconuts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:46:19 2015 UTC,"It depends on how cold your freezer is and how well you wrap the item. Ice crystals form based on how quickly you can freeze the item. The longer the process the larger the crystals and the larger the splatter and less shelf life of the item , industrial plants have methods to minimize this which is why store bought product lasts so long an cooks so well. Anything you wrap in plastic needs to be double wrapped at the least , the cold makes the wrap brittle and lessens its effectiveness. A vacuumed sealed bag or well wrapped item kept in the coldest part of the freezer will last 2-3 months as long as it never touches air."
JapaneseFood,3cyp5l,GoyoP,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:36:40 2015 UTC,Good points about wrapping them in plastic wrap. You definitely need to do that. I wouldn't push them past 3 weeks in the freezer.

JapaneseFood,3cuosv,Joonanner,6,Sat Jul 11 01:16:46 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite recipes is miso salmon. All you need is miso, mirin, soy sauce, sake and (optional) sesame oil. I think the ratio is supposed to be 2 tbsp miso and 1 tbsp everything else, but don't quote me on that. I make it all the time so I just eyeball it now. Should make a paste, not a liquid. Coat salmon in that and refrigerate for half an hour, then scrape most of the marinade off and broil on high for 12 to 15 minutes until cooked through.  This goes super well with miso soup, plain rice, and tsukemono ( Japanese pickles, also easy to make). I usually leave out the sesame oil, and I've made it without the sake too when I was out, but in my opinion the other ingredients are nonnegotiable.  As far as sweets...you can get crazy and make your own mochi (my first time I just followed the instructions for cocoa mochi on the side of a mochiko box, but there's tons of recipes for it online so look around if you want) or you can buy frozen taiyaki to microwave. That's pretty much a fish shaped, slightly sweet pancake with sweet red beans in it. It makes a good breakfast when you drink matcha green tea with it too :D  Also, hi-chew in mango is my favorite candy ever. And try Calpico! All the flavors I've had are good.  Anyways, sorry this isn't formatted super great. I'm on mobile and got a bit carried away! Good luck with trying new things!   Edit: I dug up a link for the pickles I make here. That site is where I usually start my search for Japanese recipes to try! She gives really clear instructions and usually posts video instructions also if you learn better that way."

JapaneseFood,3cuosv,inferno229,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:11:11 2015 UTC,"You're fine in this sub.  Just want to share a story: the local Japanese market at the food court, Asians (regardless of ethnicity) would all form a line at the Ramen stall that served real authentic Ramen (not the store bought instant kind). However, the Western (i.e. White/Caucasian) ones would eat at the Chinese stall which confused me initially as it's like if you're at a Japanese food market, shouldn't you eat at the Japanese food stalls as they most likely have the best food as it's more fitting? It's because Westerners are more familiar with Chinese cuisine which is too strange as the Ramen from the ramen stall of course is descended from Chinese cooking but is deemed as too exotic/Japanese for their tastebuds even though I can imagine they've eaten instant ramen before. Not even the those of Chinese descent would eat at the Chinese food stall besides them not only knowing they're at a Japanese food court, but they know they can get better Chinese food elsewhere.  You seem like the person who's willing to branch out even though you find some items intimidating. Please, don't be as Asians (I'm Asian) are typically excited for those who are not Asian to try out their food. If the Asian market is Japanese, be sure to try out the Japanese food stalls at their food court. In other words, line up at the stall with other Asians waiting in line (usually a very good sign) since it's in our mantra to want authentic preparations of food. You'll then get ideas to make new authentic recipes."

Sang in a hidden library and bank vault.  2) Check out Zauo.  You catch your own fish, everyone cheers for you, bangs drums, then they whisk the fish off and cook it how you want.  Just be warned, it took me 45mins to catch one (you can just order food regularly if you are having trouble) 3) Definitely go to Mizuno for okonomiyaki.  Get there early and go hungry.   4)  Snack, snack, snack.  Anything you see will probably be at least interesting.  There are so many shops in the shopping arcades there.  Its amazing.   Aww man.

JapaneseFood,3ar2xk,Account9726,2,Mon Jun 22 20:42:35 2015 UTC,You could try Hiyayakko.  The soy sauce and grated ginger do a pretty good job of masking some of the fishy smell.
JapaneseFood,3ar2xk,lotr818,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"I'll give that a try! I like Hiyayakko anyway, and the other toppings plus lack of heat might make the dish a bit more acceptable to start people on. Thanks!"

JapaneseFood,3ar2xk,mofumofuyamamayu,2,Tue Jun 23 05:02:15 2015 UTC,"I can't say anything for sure as I don't know what type of katsuobushi you are using. But as a topping, we usually use the type of shavings shaven more finely and thinly than the ones good for making stock, which is usually available in a bag of small packets.  But first of all, I'm wondering what's wrong with just putting no katsuobushi topping if everyone else doesn't like it. Basically, katsuobushi as a topping is added for enriching the fragrance of food as well as the taste."
JapaneseFood,3ar2xk,mofumofuyamamayu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:15:58 2015 UTC,"My shavings are rather big, so that might be part of the problem.  And of course there is nothing wrong with not using it as a topping, but as you say it enhances the taste and aroma and I think people will like it once they get used to it. So I was wondering if there were different types, like the equivalent of ""milk chocolate"" versus ""extra dark chocolate,"" that would be better for introducing it to people who hadn't had it before.  I'll probably try ripping it up a bit finer, try the recipes the others recommended, and see how it goes. Hopefully people will get a taste for it, but of course if they don't I'm not going to force it on them."
JapaneseFood,3ar2xk,sean_incali,2,Tue Jun 23 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"OK. I'm wondering if it's impossible for you to get this type of easy-to-use finer shavings that I mentioned in the previous post over there.  For a more tips on the recipes (hiyayakko/sliced onion) others recommended, I always put in some ground white sesame and a bit of shichimi pepper (can be replaced with chili oil) along with katsuobushi shavings that would not only help to lessen the fishy smell but surely make your food much better!!   Edit: Oh! I forgot to say as for onion salad, it's better to mix everything to prepare."
JapaneseFood,3ar2xk,GoyoP,2,Tue Jun 23 22:56:30 2015 UTC,"Don't use it as much. But honestly, I use hon dashi powder."
JapaneseFood,3ar2xk,GoyoP,2,Fri Jun 26 05:45:13 2015 UTC,"What you should do is find the ""soft"" Katsuobushi. It's finer flakes and has a much less pronounced fragrance. It has ソフト written on the package."
JapaneseFood,3apkc7,Itakeurpants,5,Mon Jun 22 13:40:51 2015 UTC,"Oh no! That looks like the shelf stable kind! I'm glad you liked it, but that's seriously like the worst kind I've ever had. Normally I find them in my local Asian store, refrigerated and cool. They're less gummy and I find the flavor to be way better. I understand not everyone has an awesome Asian grocer nearby (I just moved, trust me I know!) but if you ever get the chance try the refrigerated kind."

I have found many common items were cheaper in lower manhattan, flushing or sunside queens. plan to eat in - they have plenty of just prepared ready to eat above average quality stuff reasonably priced, and places inside and out to enjoy it. mitsuwa has shelf restocking workers who speak clear english, know their inventory who are happy to assist you in finding something, or understanding the difference between products - this is  my biggest problem - as 4 Japanese products may look exactly the same, but could be a dramatically different quality levels, texture or flavor. don't assume if mitsuwa stocks it, it's a good product.  I've bought many items there that were a total waste once I got them home and used them correctly. do not buy starches (that are not unique to japan) as the big chinese grocers sell them (rice legumes noodles) much cheaper."

I found some blog by someone who writes for Trash Up, which appears to be a magazine dedicated to alternative/lesser known things. She ate a snake referencing how it was supposed to keep you young according to an old horror manga. She said it tasted good.  I am guessing this is a thing people are aware of is something that can be and occasionally is done, but it is rare. Probably like it is anywhere else.   A different blog talks about how it was eaten in the Edo period as an alternative meat but now the people who eat snake in Japan are very few. It is still common in China and Taiwan and Korea.

JapaneseFood,39dnx5,sean_incali,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:39:02 2015 UTC,I recommend this one but don't get it from here.   You should be able to find it in every Japanese grocery store for a lot less.
JapaneseFood,39dnx5,Stiltzy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:48:04 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'll look for that-quick and easy
JapaneseFood,39dnx5,sean_incali,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:34:26 2015 UTC,Is that hon tsuyu or straight?
JapaneseFood,39dnx5,Stiltzy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:19:33 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you mean but you do dilute it with water if using it for soba
JapaneseFood,39dnx5,sean_incali,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:08:35 2015 UTC,Ah ok. Hon tsuyu means concentrated I think. You're supposed to dilute it for soba.
JapaneseFood,39dnx5,dstam,3,Thu Jun 11 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"Dashi is key. You can make or buy dashi, depending on what you've got access to. You also need soy sauce, mirin, and some sugar. Use about 3 parts dashi to 1 part of the rest combined. The ratios of the soy, mirin, and sugar depend on your taste. I like to keep it simple and do a 1:1:1 ratio.   I often make it like this: 1 tbsp each of soy sauce, mirin and sugar. 1/2 cup dashi. I like to put chopped scallions in as well."
JapaneseFood,39dnx5,bruddahmacnut,3,Thu Jun 11 02:34:51 2015 UTC,I like to add a little wasabi too. Gives it a nice kick.

It's a term in Chinese culinary (itame style dishes are considered Chinese style food) that refers to imparting a smoky taste to the food by using a wok.

JapaneseFood,396vr4,tekton23,2,Tue Jun 9 18:06:58 2015 UTC,I tried making one girl last week. Couldn't get a filling to rice ratio that didnt feel like I was just eating a load of heavy rice. It was hard to eat for the most part because of that.
JapaneseFood,396vr4,Carlos13th,2,Tue Jun 9 20:31:10 2015 UTC,"I was just eating a load of heavy rice. It was hard to eat for the most part because of that.    A lot of them are very rice heavy. You could always add flavour to the rice, brush with soy sauce or mix in furikake, to make it more enjoyable."

JapaneseFood,396vr4,Kawaii_Fart_Tits,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:24:47 2015 UTC,"I think it takes practice to find a ratio you like. Lots of Japanese really like the flavor of plain rice seasoned lightly, so a small filing is fine. In the west we like our rice as side to condiments rather than the main attraction it seems."
JapaneseFood,396vr4,Carlos13th,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"Makes sense good point about the difference between Japan and the West, its the same with Japanese food compared to Chinese too. There is also a chance I made the rice too stodgy to ensure it would stick or didn't season it enough. I will have to try Onigiri in a restaurant sometime to see how it differ's so I can tailor my future attempts accordingly if I like the restaurant version. I have never had it before but made it for my girlfriend who had and wanted it again."

Researchers have suggested that they be considered a separate species, N. viverrinus, or that raccoon dogs of Japan could be further divisible into separate subspecies as N. p. procyonoides (hondo-tanuki) and N. p. albus (ezo-tanuki), but both views are controversial.  As the tanuki, the animal has been significant in Japanese folklore since ancient times. The legendary tanuki is reputed to be mischievous and jolly, a master of disguise and shapeshifting, but somewhat gullible and absentminded. It is also a common theme in Japanese art, especially statuary.    Image i     Interesting: Kachi-kachi Yama | Ponpoko | Japan | Raccoon dog   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Takeshita Street is busy, but so interesting and there are lots of nice crepe places. There are also quieter streets with non chain shops if you want to get away from the crowds. On Omotesando street there's an amazing toy store called Kiddy Land, which is fun to look around (and there are loads of toilets!)."

JapaneseFood,377zwi,vanishinglex,2,Mon May 25 17:04:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this post, it's like a reference for me! So many things I recognise, and so many more I want to try!  We moved here 2 months ago for a few years, and the food here is an amazing experience!  I don't suppose by any chance there are more details available of where you found everything? Shinjuku for example is 20 mins on the train for me, but as you probably know, finding one restaurant there could be challenging....  Particularly interested in everything you found in Tokyo as that's where I live! Great photos!"
JapaneseFood,377zwi,vanishinglex,1 point,Tue May 26 05:37:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Hmm I can actually remember the whereabouts of some of the places, or I can ask someone the name of the place if there's anything in particular that you fancy?"
JapaneseFood,377zwi,coming_out,2,Tue May 26 10:48:32 2015 UTC,"Ok this is a bit of a brain fart, but these are the things that caught my attention!  The Showa place in shinjuku,   I found the uobei in shibuya, round the corner from a sushi zenmai (which are a great nice chain)  Wondering where the 100 yen kaitenzushi was,  where the ""cakes galore""  came from, was it the shop saying ""lovely cakes""  side note, did you try the Suntory plum wine? green carton, even sweeter (i have a bit of a sweet tooth!)  The Ice cream mochi, from a kombini? a supermarket? looks delish.  melon pan is amazing, check this out for the nicest one I have tried!!! http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/03/24/where-to-find-the-ultimate-melon-bread-in-japan/  currypan is indeed great, just ate one from a familymart :D  scary fact Mcdonalds do home delivery to many places in japan, including my house, but so far in 2 months ive only done it once, resiiiiist the teriyaki burger (and get them much cheaper from the supermarket hehe)  the green tea ice cream sandwich looks nice, i once had some frozen mango puree balls that were amazing, but havent seen them since :(  Thank you for showing Beard papas, there is one a few stops down the line for me :)   One thing on the list i didnt like the look of though, cucumber pringles! but thats only cos cucumber is one of the few foods i dislike.   Is Katsuya a chain? or a specific place?  where did you find the crunchy chocolate, green tea ice cream and other weird sandwiches? I've only seen normal savoury flavours everywhere yet! special editions perhaps?  Another Interesting side note that most people refer to baskin robbins here as 31  Dowhats looks a bit like a Cronut (they sell them in waitrose) compination of croissant and doughnut..... where did you find it?  Where was the indian curry in tokyo? looks semi authentic minus the egg!  We found a seventeen ice cone machine in the photobooth basement floor of the taito game arcade in akihabara in tokyo, it sold quite the flavour variety!  Please of course, dont go to any special efforts to identify these, just if you happen to be able to remember a couple off hand, that would be great, but I don't want to put you out with loads of searching etc!!!  Noted from your comments that you are coming here permanently to work, and marrying your partner too, congratulations!!! I've just moved here for likely a couple of years with my wife, for her work, and am loving it so far. If you ever want to compare notes with a fellow British foodie in Tokyo, feel free to message me!"
JapaneseFood,377zwi,HamyHam,1 point,Wed May 27 09:15:28 2015 UTC,"I asked my partner and he said the Showa place is called はんべえ(Hanbee), the kanji is 半兵ヱ. Here's the link This is their website.  Google maps link I searched for it on Google maps, seems like there are a few in Tokyo! I went to the one in Shinjuku.  Not sure if I had the Suntory plum wine, but I was always trying new types of plum wine! I would usually just pick out whatever looked pretty haha. The kaitenzushi place is called Sushiro, and is a really popular chain. I'm sure there's lots in Tokyo! Yeah the cakes I had were from a shop called Anne, though that was in the middle of a town somewhere in Wakayama. Very far from Tokyo! The green tea ice creams were all from supermarkets, I typically went to Matsugen, Mesa and Yotete. I found that most things change all the time! So if you find a nice ice cream, the next month it might not be there!  Yeah Katsuya is a chain, here's their website. Katsuya It's almost like a fast food place, and will be easy to find everywhere Tokyo! Just remember their sign! If you go to any kombini, they sometimes have interesting sandwiches! Again it always varies, same with the snacks. Sometimes I would see the cream and strawberry sandwiches, sometimes I wouldn't, so I always went with nothing particular in mind to buy, just I want a sandwich or some kind of drink or snack! The Dowhat was found in a supermarket (I forgot which one!) but I'm sure it was limited edition, since I only saw it one time. The curry place was in Shinjuku, I liked it, but it was much sweeter than the stuff in the UK! I think I'll just keep to Japanese curry there. Didn't have anything like authentic Indian or UK curry inventions. Thank you! I hope you enjoy your time in Tokyo! I'm quite far away from Tokyo when I live in Japan (in Wakayama in the countryside). Though it's always nice hearing about places in the big cities!"

The most expensive thing was the flights, but everything else was cheaper than a trip in the UK or somewhere in Europe. My Japanese is really basic, so it's possible to go with very little to no knowledge. I was quite surprised that a lot of English is used in Tokyo on signs and menus, especially in the trains and subways. So eating and getting around Tokyo isn't really a problem!"

JapaneseFood,374t02,NaganoGreen,11,Mon May 25 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"The only real directions on the package say ""Rinse with water before using for cooking.""  The directions and pictures on top are for Takenoko Miso Soup.  1) 1.5 C katsuo dashi, 2 T mirin, 1 T soy sauce, pinch of salt, all together.  2) Simmer the bamboo shoots in this broth until volume is halved.  3) Add 45 g miso (25 of ""saikyou/kyoto-style miso"" and 20 of red miso, if you have them available, but I doubt the type of miso matters that much.) Simmer and serve."

Personally I have never had any issues eating them straight from my backyard when I still grew bamboo.  That being said, I can't say for certain whether those are raw or not, but the back looks more like a serving suggestion than cooking instructions."
JapaneseFood,374t02,yomimashita,1 point,Sun May 24 22:59:08 2015 UTC,"Unlike most vegetables, raw bamboo shoots aren't safe to eat unless just picked.  Fresh bamboo shoots that you didn't just pick yourself need to be prepared correctly.  Anything sold in a packet has already been cooked though."
JapaneseFood,374t02,Xnfbqnav,1 point,Mon May 25 11:09:00 2015 UTC,That's weird. What happens to them after being picked that they need to be cooked?

Then below that it suggests:   same proportion as above to make miso soup and nimono (boiled dishes in dashi stock) 500ml of water per stick for men no kake tsuyu (soba broth) 100ml of water per stick for don mono (rice bowl dishes)   All are indicated for 2 servings.

I ended up using a food processor and added a lot of liquid back to the beans.  For the buns, instead of 1 cup milk, I used 6 oz coconut milk. I'm lactose intolerant and avoid dairy when I can. I steamed some in a rice cooker for 15-20 minutes and used the same recipe to bake others (the recipe works well for steaming or baking). I put them in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 415 degrees F until golden brown.  Delicious."

When I think of meth in the context of Japan I think of msg because both are chemicals discovered in Japan.  You say MSG is not akin to meth.  'Akin' is a value judgment.  I think it applies in this context.  SO we disagree.  How can you argue with the way I've decided to think of things?  Idk not worth getting in a fight on the internet about, like everything else isn't.  EDIT: They were even discovered within ten years of each other!  And at the University of Tokyo! :D"
JapaneseFood,36goha,folderol,1 point,Tue May 19 18:22:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not upset.  It just sounded like you couldn't understand why I would ask a question that had such an obvious answer and then went back and revised your post because you knew it wasn't clear what the connection was.  No big deal.   Akin' is a value judgment   No it isn't in this case.  MSG will not rot my teeth, fuck up my pleasure centers and my body creates glutamate all on its own.  One is a major epidemic that is socially and economically destructive and the other is not.  Nobody gave their troops MSG to keep them fighting full bore.  You can think about it any way you like but it doesn't make your analogy valid.  It is interesting where and when they were discovered."

I have a small metal fondue pot and i add a few of the fatty bits of meat first. Let that fry up. Those i dip in soy sauce and eat with rice. Then in the fat, i add halved garlic and slices of ginger. When i make it for myself, i also add thin slices of hot pepper. When the mixture is fragrant, i add long green onion and fry a little. Then i add a broth and some sake.  Let that simmer while i prep the meats and veggies. When I'm done, the soup is usually done. Then i add in white miso and enjoy"

JapaneseFood,35u9p4,BCJunglist,10,Wed May 13 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"There's a dish in Thailand called dancing shrimp. It's live small shrimp in chilis and lime. First time I had it, I had this moral dilemma for a hot minute. The restaurant was on the water. One of the shrimP's managed to hop outa the pot and into the water, to freedom... where it immediately got eaten by a fish alive. Made me think most the things we as humans eat pretty much get eaten alive or die quite gruesomely. The way most chefs prepare their dishes is merciful compared to how they'd die in nature."

I'd like to think that's true but it's not likely that animals appreciate being boiled or dissected alive. There are more humane preparation methods and getting eaten alive may lead to a quicker death.

JapaneseFood,3560sx,lovelight,4,Thu May 7 12:07:02 2015 UTC,"Here's my okonomiyaki tips:   Don't be afraid to burn the edges a little Cook it slow, I use medium heat on an electric stove, if you have a temperature controlled griddle use the temps the package suggests I like bacon better than the pork belly they use in Japan Yes you should put that much mayonnaise on it, it's very good"
JapaneseFood,3560sx,Lodley,3,Thu May 7 12:34:22 2015 UTC,"This is roughly what it says, with some additional notes from personal experience:  Step one: mix 160cc of water with the flour and purple package. In the future, mix water with 1-1.5 cup of flour.  Step two: break and mix in 2 eggs, what ever is in the yellow package, and a handful of finely chopped cabbage.   Add additional ingredients like bacon, pitted umeboshi, scallops, cut up luncheon meats, corn, green onion, kimchi, etc... And mix.  Step three: heat your grill to 200C or a pan on your stove top (med-high heat), add some oil. When the griddle/pan is heated (3 min) it is ready to use. Pour the batter to make 2 large ""pancakes"".    Step four: Adjust the heat. When the edges look solid (5 min), flip them.  Step five: cook them for 2 min. Remove from grill/pan  Step six: add okonomiyaki sauce, a dollop of mayo and some of the bonito flakes to the top (aonori is also good on okonomiyaki)  Edit: FYI, 160cc=0.67 cups and 200C=~400F"
JapaneseFood,3560sx,neowie,4,Thu May 7 12:26:59 2015 UTC,"FYI, 160cc=0.67 cups   1 cc = 1 ml, in America I've never seen cc on measuring cups but a lot of them have ml."

JapaneseFood,3560sx,neowie,3,Thu May 7 12:42:41 2015 UTC,"It says to use more cabbage and that your batter is too thick...  Seriously though, my biggest advice would be to follow the recipe as translated above, don't be afraid to add more water to thin it out a bit and use a TON of cabbage.  It should look like a bowl of cabbage loosely bound together by some batter.  Of course okinomiyaki is ""as you like it"" so you don't have to do it this way but if you are looking for an authentic experience, add MORE CABBAGE!"

Also, green tea flavoring is much more stereotypically exotic and fancy than strawberry or pudding or something, so it probably got even more popular not necessarily because it's a better flavour but just because it's something easy and obvious for hipsters etc. to latch onto.    And of course, the flavour may not be distinct, but it's still pretty good either way."

You can leave whatever you don't like on the plate, and no one will think you're rude, especially so if it's a restaurant or hotel. There are plenty of Japanese picky eaters as well. Here's a handy-dandy guide on how to eat fish. It's in Japanese, but it has pictures and a slideshow. You'll notice how there's a bunch of leftover fish parts on the plate, so there's no need to fret about eating everything."
JapaneseFood,34ijy4,tougarashi,11,Fri May 1 14:02:20 2015 UTC,Writing only to add that more of the fish is edible than most people think. I'd encourage you to dig around the collar (neck) and cheeks for some great meat.

JapaneseFood,343ypr,flowerdicks,2,Tue Apr 28 08:21:20 2015 UTC,Dashi is a light broth made from preserved foods such as katsuobushi (smoked dried tuna) and konbu (seaweed) most typically. These foods have high amounts of glutamates from broken down protein molecules that occur during preservation. ...so it tastes amazing.

JapaneseFood,33xwax,Nessie,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"Ah no, this was definitely chewy. Almost unbreakably chewy. It was like chewing raw chicken skin (though it wasn't that)."

JapaneseFood,333h9f,FatMarker,2,Mon Apr 20 01:52:59 2015 UTC,"Just tried it, not bad, bland to almost an egg drop soup taste without soy/tamari sauce. No special kind here. It looks super slimy and has that as a slight texture. Not as slimy sticky as say natto (never again...) so I could handle it, but might not be for everyone. Best to try some, like the natto, and explore new foods.  I feel you are right kun, lots of Americans are taught when they are young to cook everything meat-based for fear of bacteria, fungi, or worms. For most, it's best to do a little homework to see if the fears are justified, then ease into food items as they feel comfortable doing so. Worked on people I know with sashimi, just eased in."

None of us spoke japanese, so we just grabbed a pack of meat that we thought looked somewhat like bacon.    Got it back to the place we were staying, fried up a pan full and started talking about how this didn't taste anything like American bacon and wondering if it was made from a different part of the pig like Canadian bacon.  Then the one member of our group who can read Japanese walks in, overhears us, checks out the package in the fridge and starts laughing his ass off.  Turns out it was horse.

My bf and I got a variety pack of steaks and were so excited to have a super beefy dinner. As we were cooking them up I noticed they'd starting going red. I freaked out but then realised as it was just a ""variety pack"" with no actual named cuts, it was probably a different cut I'd never had before and it just cooked that way.  When we got around to eating them, they were so tough (beef steak cooking times do not apply to venison steak!) and tasted so gamey. Turns out (as you're probably aware by now) that they were venison steaks. In the end, I was just gutted that I'd cooked them incorrectly.   As a side note, why does eating horse bother people, but not venison?

I don't know why but I really can't get my head around horses being cheaper than cows.   It has to be because of all the rich girls in England that own horses. But then that's treating the horse humanely. They might not need that much land if they're being bred for consumption. In fact it'd probably be detrimental to the overall quality of the meat.

Would it be reasonable to eat a mentally retarded person, or a hermit, or someone who lived out in the jungle?   I'm not doing this to convert people or hate on people who eat meat, but to unpick some of the assumptions surrounding meat.

I'm not going to attempt to force you to eat dog or stop you from eating beef.  But any attempt at classifying some animals as morally acceptable to eat and the others as not on the basis of your own subjective criteria is going to be arbitrary and inconsistent. And again, that's fine. None of us are perfect. But you should be honest that it's hypocritical.   Also also, wait, what?

JapaneseFood,32kb5u,Subotan,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:40:07 2015 UTC,"""...arbitrary and inconsistent...""  That's not true. And I explained why it's not true. I can only assume you do not know the meaning of the word arbitrary.  arbitrary - 'based on a random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system'  Even if someone's reasoning is subjective and debatable, it doesn't make it arbitrary.   And the reason I didn't respond to your original post is because your 'counter-arguments' are absurd and don't even contradict what I said. A 'mentally retarded person' has relationships with humans. A 'hermit' and 'someone who lived out in the jungle' still have intelligence.  I appreciate logical discussion, but you were just being offensive."
JapaneseFood,32kb5u,jelloskater,-1,Wed Apr 15 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but I own a dictionary. I only use words when I know the meaning of them.   Even if someone's reasoning is subjective and debatable, it doesn't make it arbitrary.    I didn't say the reasoning is arbitrary, but that the end result of any classification is going to be arbitrary. I understand that people often have more sophisticated processes when choosing to eat animals other than personal whim, but that ultimately these systems collapse under scrutiny because they have inconsistent results and therefore create arbitrary categories. You actually concede this in your first post when you agree that these reasons are arbitrary, even if their reasoning is supposedly more complex.  For example, pigs are well known within biology as intelligent animals. They are certainly capable of relationships with humans, and they are some of the most intelligent common animals in human society. A criteria for human consumption based on intelligence would certainly exclude pigs - but do many people who would refuse to eat dogs on the basis of their intelligence and relationship to humans refuse to eat pork? I doubt it.   Even for those people who do, where is their line between edibility and inedibility? Which animal is only barely smart enough to avoid being eaten, and which is its unfortunate counterpart which is just dumb enough to be eaten? Would they eat a stupid dog incapable of forming relationships with humans? What about an incredibly empathetic rabbit?   A 'mentally retarded person' has relationships with humans   Ok, what about a person born a vegetable, who only has relationships assigned to them by other humans?   A 'hermit' and 'someone who lived out in the jungle' still have intelligence.   Fine, imagine a stupid hermit then. The actual specifics of the counter-example don't matter - just apply any criteria you can think of to a person."

Whenever I see it, I always think, ""Nah, I'd eat the dog, too,"" not because I'm particularly gluttonous, but just because treating animals differently because they're perceived to be ""cute"" or ""friendly"" is ridiculous. Cows are cute. Chickens are cute. Fish are cute. It's almost, I don't know, disrespectful to discriminate.  It's also the reason I resent the campaigns to ""save the baby seals"" and so on. Not because I don't like baby seals, but just because they're the most adorable furry sausages to ever exist doesn't make them any more important than say, tarantulas, or any other animal that made the mistake of being born less than photogenic.

JapaneseFood,32kb5u,LemurianLemurLad,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"but have no objection to eating animals that have been bred to be food   You're making a logical leap from ""this is the case"" to ""this ought be the case"" here. The fact that a species is bred for human consumption doesn't mean it should be - for example, pigs are widely considered to be one of the most intelligent non-primate species."
JapaneseFood,32kb5u,Subotan,0,Wed Apr 15 12:34:14 2015 UTC,"While we're on the subject of logical fallacies...   All-or-nothing thinking (or dichotomous reasoning): seeing things in black or white as opposed to shades of gray; thinking in terms of false dilemmas.   I think its a absurd that you're implying that my system of morality must exist in a purely binary state.  ""All meat or no meat.""  I mean, by your logic, if there are any plants shouldn't be eaten (for example endangered varieties), then no plants should be eaten. Furthermore, if there is any meat you find morally acceptable, then eating human babies straight from the womb should be just fine.    Clearly these examples are a ludicrous and extreme, but that's where your absolutist ideas are headed.  There are shades of gray in the world.  Its a lot easier to stay sane once you accept that fact."

Clearly these examples are a ludicrous and extreme, but that's where your absolutist ideas are headed.   Well, this is a clear example of a slippery slope.   If you'd asked me what my criteria are for deciding what animals are appropriate to eat I'd have been happy to clarify it's animals who can't feel pain. It's why I eat oysters.  I do notice though you don't explain how you get from your premise ""animals are bred for food"" to ""animals should be bred for food"".   I think its a absurd that you're implying that my system of morality must exist in a purely binary state.   I don't think this is your view. I think your reasoning is muddled and produces inconsistent results. Deciding whether a given animal is fit for consumption on the basis of a value judgement (e.g. exceptional intelligence, liking horses etc.) is ultimately subjective, and even when people make incorrect judgements (e.g. deciding not to eat animals if they are intelligent, but eating pigs) the distinctions they end up making are arbitrary.   What specifically is it about an animals intelligence which means it does not get eaten and another one does? Is there a test or a ranking? Which is the animal that just isn't quite smart enough to not get eaten and which is the one that is just smart enough to survive?  As I see it, the only consistent answers to those questions can come from a utilitarian perspective."

I'm glad you have Korean salted seaweed snacks, I live off those things. I couldn't find any furikake/rice topping, though. I prefer cooking my own rice, but I'm not sure you could make a profit off of shipping bags of rice for free.  Unfortunately I have Japanese and Korean stores within 30-40 minutes of me, and I usually buy a lot of refrigerated and frozen ingredients, too, so I don't know that I'll be using your service. I'll recommend it to friends in more rural areas, though. :)"

I used to live in an area with great access to Japanese food and drink, but I moved to a place that has almost no asian markets at all, except for chinese stuff that i don't like the taste of. So, this service makes me EXTREMELY happy! Amazon is way to expensive to really use for most of the stuff i want to buy so i have not felt able to purchase any snacks while here.   It looks like you have most everything i would be interested in ordering except for Funaoka shoga tsumami cookies. They are AMAZING! This is the brand I'm talking about.   Also, it would be nice if you offered a discount for purchasing drinks in bulk. For example, i would love to buy the Calpico drinks in groups of 10-30, but at $2.99 that is too much for me when I am used to paying about $1.87 for them at my old local stores. So, if you have a constant special that says 'Buy 10, they only cost $2.25 each or Buy 20, they only cost $2.00 each', then I would be much more likely to purchase a lot of them instead of just 1 or 2.  Thank you again for this! :)"
JapaneseFood,321lbt,chapstickninja,2,Fri Apr 10 08:18:51 2015 UTC,"Excellent idea, and I completely agree that we need to add bulk discounts for ordering more than one drink.

JapaneseFood,31wn64,hubbabubbathrowaway,17,Wed Apr 8 19:04:51 2015 UTC,"You probably will not notice a difference, especially if it gets used within a month or two. There's a lot of sodium in soy sauce and that makes it difficult for bacteria to grow and cause it to go bad. You will probably notice a difference in flavor after a longer time though. I keep mine in the fridge to retain flavor as long as possible. Here's what Kikkoman says on their website:   Do I need to refrigerate my opened bottle of soy sauce?  Once opened, the soy sauce will start to lose its freshness and the flavor will begin to change. By refrigerating the sauce, the flavor and quality will remain at their peak for a longer period. As long as no water or other ingredients have been added to the soy sauce, it would not spoil if it had not been refrigerated."
JapaneseFood,31wn64,PatrickNLeon,7,Wed Apr 8 19:45:43 2015 UTC,I've never bothered. Nothing with that much salt in it required refrigeration in my book.
JapaneseFood,31wn64,specofdust,3,Wed Apr 8 21:47:50 2015 UTC,It's not about bacteria; it's about intensity of flavor. Unrefrigerated becomes more intense a LOT faster than refrigerated.

If you hold a pencil with thumb and index that's fine but most people do not and you may have less fine control and additional fatigue holding it strangely.   I just tried your grip and there's no way to open up the chopsticks to grab something large, it's a very static grip. If you can pick up large and heavy pieces using it go for it but I think it's limited to a small range of motion."

JapaneseFood,31by5l,refrigeratorbob,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:46:57 2015 UTC,"Not bad per se, but the range of motion comes from holding the stick between the index and middle, which bend at the knuckle, with the thumb giving support. If it's just the index and thumb, you only have a fraction of the range and the index finger knuckle is locked in place. Its the difference between being able to pick up something an inch wide and 4 or more inches.   If you don't mind, take a picture of your chopstick grip closed and fully open, and compare that to the proper grip open and closed. Proper grip can achieve 90 degree angle between the sticks, your grip remains at about 30 degrees"
JapaneseFood,31by5l,refrigeratorbob,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"I meant bad as in informal  http://imgur.com/a/CWhGH  I see now that I can't get the 90 degree reach, but is there any time where you would pick up something that big?  And for the last picture, if I were to go down to a tighter grip I would need to reposition it in my fingers a little. I still have a tight fulcrum there"
JapaneseFood,31by5l,hlhlhlhl,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:20:59 2015 UTC,In a proper grip you won't need to reposition fingers. Index finger doesn't budge and the hand doesn't curl or rotate. The extent of the movement is the index and middle finger doing a 'come here' motion. It's very solid and almost impossible to knock out of one's hand. You should be able to wildly shake hand with gripped chopsticks without slipping or letting go. You can pick up rocks as well as individual grains of rice. You can scoop and pick up a whole small bowls worth of sushi rice at once. You can easily catch a napkin flung into the air. You have enough grip strength to be slightly painful if closed on body parts and pinching skin. It can be opened and closed very rapidly (You can make lots of noise rapidly tapping them together) without the sticks slipping or needing to be adjusted. Any adjustment can simply be made by loosening grip vertically above a plate and recentering grip. Entire meal can be eaten one-handed.

JapaneseFood,310atx,shortpaleugly,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:00:09 2015 UTC,How many blocks are you using?  I made a Japanese style chicken curry for the first time this week- I'm Indian so it was a first- and using 2 blocks I felt the sauce wasn't as thick as it normally is in Japanese restaurants.  I'm wondering if you're meant to use all of the blocks.
JapaneseFood,310atx,rxs420,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:36:43 2015 UTC,I normally use 6 blocks (1/2 box) of curry roux for 3&1/2 cups of water. It might also depends on what brand you're using.
JapaneseFood,310atx,shortpaleugly,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:32:01 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I think I'll use the whole box which consists of 5 blocks at the next attempt- it was still good though so I approve of Japanese curry as a viable alternative to Indian ones.

JapaneseFood,310atx,naery,4,Thu Apr 2 23:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going to copy/paste from an email I sent to my family about my gluten-free Japanese curry recipe.  It's awesome (to me), and it's at least a great starting point.  Feel free to adapt and change however you want.   N.B. The Amazon links are all non-ref, but they are Smile links.    Hey all,  I feel like I've finally hit on a good way to make curry and I'd like to share the recipe.  Obviously, this is highly configurable as far as what main ingredients you add, but the first part (the roux) is absolutely critical foundation to making it ""right"" and shouldn't be modified too much.   TO make the roux:   curry powder (I use S&B spicy curry powder, see P.S.) (side note: I've only ever used the dark red tin and I don't know if the yellow tin is the same stuff or not) coconut flour (or regular wheat flour, but amounts will prob be different) (I'm pretty sure it's not Red Mill, but I can't remember brand) soy sauce (I use Tamari, which is gluten-free) butter or oil (I use coconut oil) (optional) shaved/grated 1/2 apple (many Japanese people add this to give a slight sweetness to the roux)   The amounts that I use are hard for me to say exactly, but I'll ballpark it.  I use between 4 and 6 tablespoons of curry powder, the amount affects the heat, and a little less than (or about) half a teaspoon of coconut flour.  (Coconut flour is much finer than regular wheat flour, so I don't need much of it at all; if you used regular wheat flour, you'd maybe want to use a bit more, but I couldn't tell you how much exactly.)    Put the curry powder in a large-ish skillet, add the coconut flour to it, pour just enough soy sauce over top to surround the dry ingredients, then add butter or oil (just enough to start browning the flour and make a paste, not enough to make a sauce).    Once you've made a thick, gooey, play-dough looking roux, and it's been cooked a bit and the flour is browned, you can start adding other ingredients like chicken, mushrooms, zucchini, carrots, bell peppers, onions, beef, peas, potatoes, honey, broccoli, spinach, squash, cheese, etc.    Key Point: You also want to add water, to convert the roux into a sauce, however much you want for making your sauce as thin or thick as you like it; I add it at the beginning of adding the main other ingredients.   This is the way I've made it the last few times, and it's been absolutely perfect.  If you're interested, I could try making a video, but I won't go to the trouble if you're not interested.    P.S. For reference, the ingredients of S&B Curry Powder are: Ingredients Turmeric, Coriander, Fenugreek, Cumin, Red Pepper, Black Pepper, Cinnamon, Ginger, Star Anise, Cloves, Cardamon, Fennel, Nutmeg, Laurel Leaves, Allspice and Garlic"

JapaneseFood,310atx,shortpaleugly,9,Wed Apr 1 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"""Block paste tastes different from the dark, rich, sweet Japanese style curry.""  Seeing as no one makes it from scratch in Japan, they buy blocks or other preprepared sauce, there is really no point."
JapaneseFood,310atx,grabbygrab,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:40:53 2015 UTC,How many blocks would you advise using to make a dish?  I used S&B Golden Curry and to make a chicken curry that serves 5 according to this recipe I personally used 2 blocks but felt the sauce was somewhat runny.  Are you supposed to use all 5 blocks when making a curry according the above recipe?
JapaneseFood,310atx,shortpaleugly,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:34:46 2015 UTC,"I use 2 for myself and whatever liquid is left in the pot  And its usually still thin, soupy, but is fine for me with udon and boiled potatos/pumpkin.  All you can do is test for yourself, and if its too thin you can always make a flour thickener. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux  If you want it thick with rice make a roux, else it wont happen.  Thats perfectly ok to do.  Japanese curry is NOT very specific or Japanese, even in Japan. Its a weird westernised dish and different places make it different ways for locals -usualy a few blocks made into a sauce with a roux, beside a plate of rice and some meat"

I have step by step instructions I sorta made up if ya want me to post them. Imo it turned out good and is easy to adjust flavors to your liking. The blocks are just to expensive (I live in Alaska) so I had to do it this way."

JapaneseFood,30sceo,LittleHelperRobot,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:00:45 2015 UTC,I was pretty depressed because my working hours were reduced by half so my SO sent me six bags of karintō! All are different flavours and the sadness is gone.    http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karinto http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karinto

JapaneseFood,30pshx,xinganbaobei,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:13:22 2015 UTC,You're kidding! Darnit! Thanks for reading.
JapaneseFood,30pshx,flojin,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:38:02 2015 UTC,I think you just copied and pasted another restaurant's address and forgot to update it. Easy fix!

JapaneseFood,30pshx,flojin,5,Mon Apr 6 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I got you a fucking suggestion. see that little crack-in-the-wall sized alley with the white stairs? Get in there, and get yourself some Okonomiyaki. There is an entire complex of art in there to go with some of the best okonomiyaki I've had in Japan (and I went for 6 months). Tip nr. 2: Get there from Harajuku station before the shops close in Harajuku. (Tip nr. 3: You might not need to get in through the crack - it leads to a bar, which is part of the complex.. It's just the entry I found. There seems to be a more flashy entrance off to the side)  Edit To my great nostalgic surprise, they've even got interior pictures on google, but I don't suggest you look at them. Better if you don't get spoiled!"
JapaneseFood,30pshx,Xanimus,2,Sun Mar 29 22:44:55 2015 UTC,"Coco Ichibanya. Best Japanese curry fo' sho'. It doesn't taste a thing like Indian or Thai curry, it's better in my opinion because it doesn't have that sweet, coconut milk taste to it. Seriously, this chain is so popular over there, that it's made it to mainland USA, but only in LA. I looked it up and it's in Shinjuku, in Tokyo. You get to choose your spice level (0-10), my husband likes kinda spicy food and went with a 4 usually, I got an 8 usually. Get it with garlic naan bread, and chopped garlic bits and cheese mixed in....oh dear God, my mouth is watering.   Also, while my husband and I lived in Okinawa, Hotto Motto was our go-to ""don't feel like cooking, go pick up food during the weeknight"" place. It's a ""to-go, bento"" place. Just looked it up, it's in Tokyo too.   And, if you get the chance to eat Oyakodon pretty much anywhere, GET IT. Sorry I don't have specific places for you. As I said, we lived in Oki, and only went through Tokyo while using Narita to get to and from the US. But I never had terrible Oyakodon anywhere I went. If it was a new restaurant I had never been too before, I looked for this on the menu first because it was familiar. It's a chicken, egg, veggie, and rice bowl. DELISH!"
JapaneseFood,30pshx,Alienz8mypopcorn,2,Sun Mar 29 23:34:24 2015 UTC,"If you're going to visit Senso-ji (a shrine) in the Asakusa district in Tokyo, I would recommend going to the best rated conveyor belt sushi called Magurobito: https://mechapot.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/maguro-bito-premium-sushi-in-asakusa/  If you're good with your Japanese and your sushi vocabulary, I would actually recommend their standing sushi branch of the same name but different owners. It's actually closer to the Tokyo Metro Asakusa Station exit and right across the street from sensoji entrance.  http://www.picrumb.com/best-restaurants/asakusa/magurobito/  Pics of food from Tabelog (a Japanese Yelp): http://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1311/A131102/13003723/dtlphotolst/"

JapaneseFood,30pshx,Nessie,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:40:39 2015 UTC,"go to Satou Restaurant in Tokyo. It's a tiny little restaurant above a butcher shop, seats maybe 20 people. Get the most expensive one, best steak in the world. The marbeling is insane and they melt like butter in your mouth. they run about 10000 yen a piece, but theyre well worth the price and it's not like you go there everyday. bring cash, somehow they dont take credit cards lol.  also, go to tsukiji fish market, probably around 5am(people get in line well before that tho). i didnt care much for the tuna auction, but i did love the restaurants there, amazing sashimi and sushi for (comparibly) cheap prices"
JapaneseFood,30pshx,mynameisthomas2,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:51:05 2015 UTC,"Take some time to travel to Hiroshima. It's a couple hours away from Kyoto/Osaka, but I found their Okonomiyaki-Mura to be amazing.  The historical aspect of Hiroshima is great too.  If you can't make it, any small-time shop in the Kansai area will have tremendous okonomiyaki, as well as takoyaki.  Keep in mind, there are two different types of okonomiyaki.  Besides that, if you can, visit small towns.  Country life is great."
JapaneseFood,30pshx,dwizzle13,1 point,Mon Mar 30 07:07:30 2015 UTC,This restaurant specializes in beef tongue- cooked in various ways. If you decide to go better book in advance.
JapaneseFood,30pshx,j3nnkolla,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:21:04 2015 UTC,"As you're looking for value, and assuming you're a meat eater, I'd definitely suggest Carrot in Nishi Ogikubo (Tokyo, Chuo / Orange line).  Great food, and mom/pop feel.  Easy on the pocketbook.  Should be on Google Maps.  Also, Iseya in Kichijoji, although I hear they've lost the old dingy charm they once had.  Just some general advice: get away from the super popular areas, and just start exploring.  Most all of the best food I've had in Japan was the result of just walking into a random place to try it out. Get off at a station, and walk along the line from station to station and see what you see.  You'll find some amazing places to eat."
