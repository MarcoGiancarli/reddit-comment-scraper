Sorry for my english  - your dog will be jealous so make sure you give him enough time and try to play with them both in one time - dog has to know his place in hierarchy, do not allow him to sit on your lap when you feed your baby - every time when your dog gives your baby signal he doesn't want to play or baby is annoying you have to react - try to teach your baby to not run into your dog with hands up....dog doesn't like it - you have to punish your dog every time when he try to bite your baby(just don't beat him) -Treat your dog like family member -allow them to play with toys together, they both learning from each other"
