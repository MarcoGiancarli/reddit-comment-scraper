Objectivism,3e08hm,Hilarious_Haplogroup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:12 2015 UTC,"There isn't a single one of history's evilest leaders that did it for themselves. Every one of those leaders claimed to be for the people or for the greater good. Why? Because when you're working with more people, the morality gets bigger. Ever hear the saying ""a single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic?"" By broadening their scale they can commit evil acts clothed in the guise of good deeds. But an act of evil done for the greater good does not become an act of good, it remains an act of evil but with utilitarian benefits. So the first thing evil people do is shift the impetus of their actions from their own selfish claim to power to a desire to help the people. This is how they maintain their power, but not how they come into it.  So how does an evil organization come into power? Yes, they typically need to start their ascent claiming to be for the people, but that's not enough, they need actual rewards. Think about it, the reason people join terrorist groups like this is the same reason they joined the barbarian hordes or the mafia: because they get direct benefits. They straight up get to steal things they want, and they can murder people who get in their way. And as long as they give the community a cut (which most successful criminal enterprises and tyrannical leaders do) they'll be covered. In fact, when they give a little back to the community they often reap huge gains because those in the community see how much potential profit there is in crime. This leads to new recruits and also a form of community nationalism where ""outsiders"" are distrusted, and any form of incursion in ""their"" land will spark a defensive reaction."

Objectivism,3dpr9z,dragohole,3,Sat Jul 18 06:48:33 2015 UTC,"Since he doesn't obey the axioms, he doesn't exist. At all. Anywhere.   The law that God - or anything at all - has to obey if it is to have a possibility of existing is the Law of Non Contradiction, which is implied from the Law of Identity, A=A.   That which exists has to have a certain identity. It can't both have a certain identity AND not have that certain identity at the same time and in the same respect. For example, a thing can not be both ""a banana"" AND ""not a banana"". Such a thing can not exist - because ""what it is - isn't"" and ""what it isn't is!"". (or what exists doesn't exist, and what doesn't exist does exist! Such a thing can not exist...if ""what it is"" both is and isn't!)  It must be either 1) a banana or 2) not a banana. (Because a ""banana"" can't exist if it is ""not a banana"" - and something which is ""not a banana"" can't exist if it ""IS a banana""!  So all things that exist must have a non-contradictory identity - and only identities that are non-contradictory can have the possibility of having an existence.  Likewise, something that is ""God and not-God"" can not exist, or something which is ""omnipotent AND not-omnipotent"" can't exist. He can't create a rock so heavy that He can't move it, so He can't be omnipotent.  (I read somewhere that Ayn Rand thought she could imagine God existing, but it could not be an all powerful one, and would have to be subject to the same laws of existence, identity and noncontradiction as everything else that exists)."

Therefore, the concept of God must be rejected, since there is no perceptual datum (or conceptual knowledge, derived from percepts), that validates the concept of God.

Objectivism,3dpr9z,trashacount12345,2,Sat Jul 18 23:58:42 2015 UTC,"dragohole - I appreciate that you seem to actually be seeking the truth in your pursuit of knowledge. I almost didn't open this thread because I thought you might be an apologist attempting to stump objectivists with circular logic.  When I read the OP, your statement ""Since God is infinite..."" jumped out at me since it was stated in such a matter-of-fact way. I would challenge this premise and ask, how do you know that God is infinite? You got that from somewhere.  If you continue down the path of also challenging the source of that information, and your source's source, I think you will arrive in the same place others have. Following this path is what broke me out of my years of brainwashing. I hate to give away the ending, but it almost always leads to someone somewhere who simply wished something to be true because that's what suited them at the time, and then they proclaim it to be true to others.  Many who make claims as to the characteristics of God have a strong enough ego to convince themselves that their own thoughts are actually from God. In this way they do not believe they are lying or misguiding anyone but actually helping others to get closer to ""Him"". It frightens me that people don't hold such high claims under equally high scrutiny. I mean, people die for their belief in this stuff!!  It is also absolutely frightening to me how so many people can fall for this delusion simply because we are inherently afraid of the unknown, and must grasp onto something.  I wish you well on your journey of knowledge. Once I came to accept that I had been misguided for so many years I felt very empty inside. My belief in God was so strong that it was part of my own identity. It took me a number of years to come to peace with the notion that we simply don't have the answer to all of this. What is amazing is now I have a renewed excitement in learning about our nature that had been previously muted by ""God"" being the answer to everything. I am no longer afraid of death the way I was when I had believed in God. I don't worry if I have lived to his cryptic standards so that I may earn my way to live in a magical land upon death.  Enjoy your pursuit!"

Objectivism,3dpr9z,congenital_derpes,2,Sat Jul 18 13:42:29 2015 UTC,"Well, atheism is a complete rejection of possibility of God's existence.  So, now that I googled it, atheism is a rejection of belief in God. I assume, that an atheist accepts the possibility of God's existence, but concludes that there's not enough evidence to believe that He exists. There's no objective ground to believe in God, therefore he doesn't believe in Him.   But does it mean that one shouldn't concern himself with such matter? If God and a spiritual realm exist, shouldn't one strive to reach it\Him? And if we don't know, if that is true, shouldn't we make getting to know it the main purpose of our life, since if His realm exists, and there's no suffering there, and there is eternal life, then it pretty much dictates your life purpose."
Objectivism,3dpr9z,thewriter1,2,Sat Jul 18 13:51:34 2015 UTC,"The 'realm' you refer to is presumably where we originated, and where we are going to after death. Our physical death is a given, so why not just wait and see, and in the mean time, concern ourselves with what is. If God is indeed omnipotent, then we need not strive to reach him, he is everywhere. And if God is the origin of the universe, then we are literally part of him. All of his is idle conjecture however, and if you want to embrace a rational epistemology, then you may have to be more selective in what avenues you pursue."
Objectivism,3dpr9z,spacecity1971,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:13:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see what you mean. Most atheists probably would outright reject God's existence. They would say they are 100% sure God doesn't exist. That seems like a black swan fallacy to me, though. I guess I go farther than an agnostic, but not as far as some atheists.  But if I don't know if God exists, should I devote my life to discovering it? No. First, there are plenty of people smarter than me who have done just that, and they've come up with nothing. Second, how would I even go about such a thing? It's not like we have some evidence, but just not enough. There is nothing. There is no basis in reality for the very idea of God."

What does one mean by 'God' as entity? Which, of course, leads to the question of 'God' as concept (What, rather than who)  A good explanation, I feel, is one posed by CS Lewis in Mere Christianity. He argues that God exists outside of Time (and, due to how physics tend to work, this leads to 'Him' being outside of Space). That is why we, as humans, cannot perceive the entity - it is a case of it (for an entity like God cannot have a gender or  biological sex. It does not have another with which to mate and is immortal due to its timelessness. It would make no sense otherwise) having too many dimensions."
