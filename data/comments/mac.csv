mac,3e1fll,WearyWeasel,6,Tue Jul 21 14:36:18 2015 UTC,"I play dota on mine and have no issues. High settings. Yes it gets hot but nothing insane. A few framerate dips but never anything crazy. If you're a casual player you'll be just fine. People here can really underestimate a mbp's ability to game. I play on mine with zero issues.  A lot of people say to watch out for heat, but a lot of people also say it's not a big deal. They're made to withstand heat. The aluminum gets hot because it's designed that way. The processor gets hot because it's working hard like it's made to. It has fans for a reason and heat isn't just some crazy side effect nobody planned for. It's a normal thing for your laptop to get hot when stressed and yes, over a long period of time it might cause damage, but it's still designed to get hot and withstand it.   Get applecare if you're afraid of it. People here just feel heat and say ""oh no, it's hot! it's probably getting all fucked up!"". Apple isn't stupid. They know what works and what doesn't work. If playing games for a few hours caused their products to get so hot that stuff malfunctioned, they would implement a design change. They're smart and they have teams of engineers who know how heat affects other components, more than some average joe on reddit does.  Use common sense. You'll know when heat becomes an issue. And macbooks (almost all electronics now) have failsafes in place to shut down the system before heat even affects any other components. Like I said, Apple isn't stupid. This is planned for and they know how to deal with it.  This has been kind of a rant but some people here are brilliant and others have no fucking idea what they're saying. I'm just giving you my take on things. Use your common sense and trust Apple's engineers' judgement."
mac,3e1fll,noneofthefoxes,0,Tue Jul 21 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"Heat can most certainly be a big deal. If you're constantly having temperatures of over 90°C, the lifespan of your MB shortens significantly. They are made to withstand heat, but that doesn't mean it should constantly be at 100°C. It'll survive for now but it'll also die much sooner than you'd like."
mac,3e1fll,WearyWeasel,3,Tue Jul 21 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"When temperatures reach dangerous levels the system shuts itself down before any harm is caused. I don't understand why that's difficult to understand.  Yes if your laptop is at a constant 100 degrees 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, then yes I guarantee it'll cause problems. But realistically when does that happen? That's a completely ridiculous scenario. If he's gaming, especially playing dota, it'll be a few hours at a time. Apple isn't fucking stupid. Also, like I said, buy Applecare if you're so concerned that Apple didn't plan on their users actually pushing the limits of their machines.  Of course using your laptop causes the lifespan to decrease. If I never use mine for anything other than browsing reddit, of course it'll last longer than one used to play games or actually do any significant processing. But it's ridiculous to tell him that he can't confidently play dota (which isn't even a difficult game for any laptop to play) for a few hours because it'll get too hot and die soon."
mac,3e1fll,noneofthefoxes,0,Tue Jul 21 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"when temperatures reach dangerous levels the system shuts itself down before any harm is caused.   Before any immediate harm is caused. If for a few hours (probably more since it's an MMORPG) a day your laptop is dealing with temperatures of over 95°C, something on your motherboard will die sooner than you'd like. I wouldn't recommend it.   If you think you can strain your laptop to temperatures just a degree below of which it shuts down and not cause any longterm damage, you are very much mistaken. And not to mention that it would be a horrible marketing move. As a consumer, you're meant to slowly damage your processor so you have to get a new one eventually. The reason it shuts down at 99°C or whatever is because if it didn't, it would die much much sooner, and you'd probably be entitled to getting a new one because of your warranty. And Intel would lose big money because of that.  Oh and, since your laptop is so cosy at 95°C, tell me how the SSD or battery will endure this? The temperatures at which they start taking slight damage is as low as 50°C, and 3 hours of 95°C can cause that."
mac,3e1fll,WearyWeasel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"My last comment must not have saved. So basically, I'm not arguing with you because you aren't listening to anything I'm saying.  You clearly don't understand basic engineering and electrical stress testing. If you don't want to use your laptop for anything significant because you don't think it can handle it, that's your choice. But don't tell other people they can't do anything on theirs either without frying the motherboard, because that's simply not true.  Some of us need to do significant processing on a daily basis, whether it be gaming or work related or video processing, etc. I trust Apple's judgement and massive team of engineers a million times more than I trust your opinion, and if something does go wrong in the next three years, I have applecare.  It's just not right for you to tell people they can't have a few hours a day of system intensive usage without frying their systems, because that's bullshit and you just don't understand the engineering and design behind it, and aren't willing to listen to any explanations.  Good day."
mac,3e1fll,noneofthefoxes,0,Tue Jul 21 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"Running your entire laptop at 45°C is not the same as running it at 95-100°C, in terms of its lifespan. You won't fry anything immediately, and I never said that.   If you trust Apple to make a laptop that'll last just as long as running it at 50°C and running it at 95°C, then you obviously don't know much about marketing and sales, which I know a lot about. They're made in such a way that they wear out when they're under constant strain. But not so much that they'll die while under AppleCare.  If you think Macbooks, or any other newer laptops for that matter, are made to last as long as physically possible, you cannot be more wrong."
mac,3e1fll,WearyWeasel,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"You may know a lot about marketing, but you know nothing about engineering apparently.  I never said they're made to last as long as possible. I also said that yes, under high temperatures constantly for 24/7, there would definitely be issues.  But you're saying in previous comments that you ""wouldn't recommend"" using a macbook under high stress even for a few hours each day, because that few hours of heat will fry the motherboard soon.  I appreciate you know the marketing side of things. I know what kind of random sample testing and algorithms go into finding the ideal warranty period for the company, and you're right they do try to maximize profit...  But at the same time, you're suggesting that these laptops can't handle a few hours of heavier processing a day without getting so hot they damage themselves. That is simply not how designing and engineering a product like this works. Once again, I trust Apple's team of engineers much more than I trust your marketing speculations. As a design-change implementation coordinator, heat is one of the big things accounted for and rigorously stress-tested for every time a product is changed. Any time a new component is used. Apple isn't stupid.  Once again, if you don't believe you can use your laptop intensively for a few hours without damaging it, then by all means keep doing what you're doing. But do not spread false information and pure speculation to others, by saying that the laptops with integrated gpu's can not handle a few hours of intense work without eventually frying their motherboards.  I can't be any more clear in explaining that that is simply not how the engineering behind it works."
