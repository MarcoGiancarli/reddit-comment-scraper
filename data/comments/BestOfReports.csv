BestOfReports,37elyj,chewy_pewp_bar,2,Thu May 28 10:34:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, that was all me. Not that I can prove it or whatever. I don't think I actually ever posted an actual comment in that thread.  It's just really disappointing to see the amount of ignorance and misinformation that gets thrown around and spread about CPS. In no small part because of the dumbass shit like what was in that thread. CPS is already crazy underfunded, and have to put up with so much shit/abusive people in the name of making sure children aren't being harmed. It astounds me how quick people are to turn on these people who's job is literally to make sure kids are safe. But it's not especially surprising. The only time they get mentioned is when something like this happens, which is more about stupid interpretation of a poorly worded (and arguably stupid) law. Not that you'd know from the majority of the comments. A story about CPS rescuing an abused child will never reach the #1 spot on r/news. Unless the kid is like, Misha Obama.  I'm fully willing to bet a good number of the people posting in that thread have no fucking clue how the CPS process works. But it's reddit. Default reddit at that. What can you expect, errybody got a PhD on whatever the topic is [the irony here is not lost on me]. There were multiple people under the impression that CPS picks and chooses what cases to handle, and more than a few straight up stating that like it was a fact. Which is 💯 wrong. If a call is made to CPS, they will act on it in some way. If they didn't, then what would be the point of CPS in the first place.  I don't remember the exact numbers of the top of my head (except that farmers are #1) but social workers have some of the highest depression/suicide rates of any profession, because no matter how much good they do in all, they get shit on like they fell into a honeybucket. It probably would have been better for me to make a CB post, but eh, whadda gonna do?"

A quick Google scholar search pointed to the article on a reputable site.  It's hard to say without knowing exactly why the mod removed it. I can see why you're annoyed about it, but I don't think it points towards mods deliberately trying to censor things.  As with a lot of things, I think it can be explained by poor judgement.  Edit: correction"

I can't help but feel like the only reason they get popular is because all of the people upvoting and commenting want to fuck the girl/guy in the pic. Half of the comments are people admitting that they want to fuck the person in the photo and the other half are people dancing around the fact they want to fuck the person in the photo. And then on top of that a bunch of white knights show up to defend m'lady and her honor. Perhaps these are just my own sexual insecurities showing but I feel like a place for cute animals should be one of the few places on the internet where there isn't sexual tension everywhere. It's nice as a male to be able to take a break from wanting to fuck everything.    Any red blooded heterosexual male claiming they had zero sexual thoughts about this girl when they commented are lying. We simply don't work like that. It's also not something to be ashamed of, we have this to thank for how well our species has done procreating.  Another interesting thing I've seen is that when it's an attractive male it's socially acceptable to admit that you want to have sex with him. And even more so if it's perceived that it's a woman making the statement.  Anyways, just some rambling that was on my mind. I understand that these aren't popular opinions."

Yeah, I think it might be you that's sexualising these things. When I saw the OP all I thought was ""that's cute"".   Any red blooded heterosexual male claiming they had zero sexual thoughts about this girl when they commented are lying. We simply don't work like that.   Please speak for yourself. Do you really think every guy immediately goes ""I want to fuck her"" when they see a pic that happens to have a decent looking woman in it?"
BestOfReports,34rfb3,Timguin,-2,Mon May 4 19:30:05 2015 UTC,"I think that a lot of guys can't admit it to themselves. I mean sure, there's a nice warm fuzzy feeling you get from thinking that a mans number one interest isn't passing on his genes but that's just not realistic. Like I said, it's also not something to be ashamed of, it's simply basic human biology. This isn't something that is particularly controversial or hard to fact check. I may not be articulating this properly but it's not always a blatant, conscious thought of ""I want to fuck this girl"". This is most definitely going on in your mind somewhere and it's certainly impacting your perception of the photo.  I mean, the reason that we think to ourselves that the person is ""decent looking"" is because we want to have sex with them. That's the entire point of finding someone attractive!"

[...] Like I said, it's also not something to be ashamed of   Oh give me a break. I - and I suspect many/most guys - have no problem with feeling sexually attracted to someone. Most of the time I will freely admit it, because it's not a big deal. But that doesn't mean I think of sex everytime I see a good looking woman. I mean, how much sexual energy do you have to store up to feel sexual tension everytime you see a cute girl? That sounds exhausting.  As for the OP, I literally saw a seemingly lovely girl on a happy day with a cute cat. If someone sees more in it, that's fine. But arguing that pictures like that are causing unwelcome sexual tension in all the poor guys who can't escape it is, quite frankly, ridiculous.  EDIT: OP edited his comment after I replied. See my other reply."

This is most definitely going on in your mind somewhere and it's certainly impacting your perception of the photo.   I'm not denying that the attractiveness of a person in the foto is altering the perception of the foto, but in your original reply you spoke of bothersome sexual tension that you want to take a break from.

BestOfReports,33313l,GoldenSights,3,Sun Apr 19 03:11:07 2015 UTC,"60% is no numpad, arrow keys, or function keys. 75% adds back the function keys. TKL (tenkeyless) adds back the arrow keys and whatever you call the keys above them; alternatively sometimes keyboards will have the numpad instead of the arrow keys etc and be called TK (I think). 101 to 104 key means a full layout, and the exact number depends on the locale and if it has Windows/super/meta/whatever keys. There's also stuff like 40%, 108 key, all sorts of fun stuff. I hope that covers the important bits though."

If you look at everyone east of India, we're only talking about a few percentage points worth of traffic.  And even in India april fool's day starts 7 hours early.    April 1st is a 2 day affair currently, it starts 12 hours before April 1st starts UTC and ends 12 hours after April 1st ends UTC. For the majority of redditors it starts at least 16 hours before April 1st and for >90% of redditors, it does start the day before.    It makes much more sense to just operate off of UTC, it's perfect for this sort of situation.  It makes it so that for the vast majority of redditors the ""shift"" due to timezones is minimal (starts 5 hours late in India, 5 hours early in America, and within a couple hours for Europe) and ensures that April Fool's Day lasts only 1 day for everyone, which avoids people burning out on the whole thing.

BestOfReports,2z3poz,longfoot,0,Sun Mar 15 19:47:05 2015 UTC,Quite right too. If we removed people for just hurting feelings you could just censor anyone you didn't like by claiming they hurt your feelings/offended you. Which actually happens in a lot of places anyway. Hence the constant outrage/victim hood.  Which is pretty terrible.

BestOfReports,2yuu1j,Bosses_Boss,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:03:39 2015 UTC,We already know this is a fact. The admins have said in the past that they've dished it out themselves before and that they have the ability to do so when they think it's worthwhile.  Dishing it out themselves is definitely a measure to encourage others to do so. Some of the gold trains we've seen around were probably admins having some fun.
BestOfReports,2yuu1j,AndThatIsWhyIDrink,0,Fri Mar 13 17:14:54 2015 UTC,What if admins gilded themselves to make it look like people appreciated them B)
BestOfReports,2yuu1j,Ultra-Bad-Poker-Face,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:36:51 2015 UTC,To add to my prior comment -   In /r/lounge right now the top post is about them guilding the moderators of many of the subreddits with 100k+ subscribers. As a thank you for all their hard work.
BestOfReports,2yuu1j,AndThatIsWhyIDrink,2,Sat Mar 14 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"Indeed they did, why not?  It's nice as a mod of a 340k sub [plus a few others] it is alot of work [yes that we signed up for but still] it was just of them to do.  It shows they appreciate our work we volunteer our time to."
BestOfReports,2yuu1j,Bosses_Boss,0,Mon Mar 16 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"As a mod of a 100k sub, using an alt - let's face it, it's not ""work"" at all, or hard. It takes 10 minutes to run the average mod queue, once or twice a day, the rest is typically behind-the-scenes policy discussion, at least in the good subreddits that operate a more council style approach to decision making, the hierarchical topmod dictatorship style doesn't fly with me.  If anything, the CSS could be argued as some pretty decent work that can be relatively difficult, as can some of the bot work. But that's all generally a one time task, 10hours or so maybe."
BestOfReports,2yuu1j,AndThatIsWhyIDrink,2,Wed Mar 18 07:49:43 2015 UTC,Maybe for your sub.   But not ours.
BestOfReports,2yuu1j,Bosses_Boss,2,Wed Mar 18 09:09:26 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you're using the wrong rules, haven't trained your filter well, or don't use automoderator as efficiently as you can then?  The core of work that occurs in our subs (I mod more than 10 of similar size) is in approving content that's been over zealously removed by the systems in place. It works better to automate as much as possible and then reapprove false submissions because it simply doesn't hurt submissions to get removed as they go back in the new queue at the same location they were pulled out when approved. There's massively less accidental content that shouldn't have been removed that needs approving compared to content that needs removing in the first place, so it reduces moderator workload enormously.  Different flavours for different people, but if mods of anywhere that isn't a default are suggesting they've got loads of work to do daily I feel like they're simply not using tools available to them as best as they could be."

This concept evolved over the course of the 19th century and became codified into law in the 20th century.

As it turns out, you can't send a ban note to a user if they're not subscribed to the subreddit.

A few years back on the World of Warcraft forums for a specific realm, I and a majority of the other active community members got banned for requesting the sticky on a certain post someone made.  Basically what happened was there was a thread about a guy with a troll (race) character looking for a guild. Someone said ""You should join so-and-so's guild, she's such a material girl. (inside joke basically.)  So so-and-so then came in and said ""Yep, I'm basically Madonna lol, WTB all the trolls"" since her troll was a troll character only guild.  Blizzard proceeds to see this and permaban her for ""celebrity impersonation and trolling"" and quote that post.  This other guy comes in and makes a rant post about the absurdity of the moderators banning someone over such an obvious joke as that as well as some certain other things recently. (They had deleted a bunch of our long standing community stickies as well just randomly out of the blue after a guildmaster on the Horde side said he would get his entire guild to report them and Blizzard just blindly deleted them after like 10 reports or so)  So since we're all pissed about the situation too we request sticky on the topic, and then we all also got banned for ""requesting sticky on a rulebreaking post.""  At which point we basically just said fuck it and made out own, quite successful forum for the community of that server and left the official boards to rot."

BestOfReports,2nu9k1,wasniahC,6,Sun Nov 30 13:53:19 2014 UTC,"Yep. The issue with GPUs is that the solder tends to become brittle and break, so baking it causes the solder to reflow and reconnect. Of course there's a chance of it going wrong, but if the card is already dead, what's there to lose other than a few hours of your time?  To be honest, I'm not 100% sure what the freezer trick actually does, but evidently it works."

I do know for sure that if your problem is specifically overheating, then putting it in the refrigerator or freezer can keep it alive long enough to dump your data onto an external hard drive (or put it on the cloud or whatever).  Did this with my sister's laptop a couple of years ago, it would shut down almost immediately after booting up from overheating, so the only way to get her data off was to stick it in the refrigerator to buy us time."

BestOfReports,2ne3o8,dakta,2,Thu Nov 27 02:43:27 2014 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism  And if you look under ""Schools"" in the side of that page, you'll see all the different political beliefs that fall under the label of Libertarianism. I don't know why Classical Liberalism isn't there...  TL;DR - Libertarianism is about maximising individual liberty and personal choice, and either using government as a vehicle to protect that liberty by limits on it, or doing without govt altogether. And there are tons of flavors and variations on this idea. Libertarian sentiment is pretty widespread in the tech/IT world, so Reddit has a lot of them, which made this pretty funny.  Also, don't visit /r/libertarian. It is a cesspool like the other political subs. That, and it has been taken over/co-opted by /r/conservative half the time."
BestOfReports,2ne3o8,tkms,2,Wed Nov 26 15:13:44 2014 UTC,"Libertarianism:       Libertarianism (Latin: liber, ""free"") is a political philosophy that upholds liberty as its principal objective. Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and freedom of choice, emphasizing political freedom, voluntary association and the primacy of individual judgment.    Libertarians generally share a skepticism of authority; however, they diverge on the scope of their opposition to existing political and economic systems. Various schools of libertarian thought offer a range of views regarding the legitimate functions of state and private power, often calling to restrict or even to wholly dissolve pervasive social institutions. Rather than embodying a singular, rigid systematic theory or ideology, libertarianism has been applied as an umbrella term to a wide range of sometimes discordant political ideas through modern history.  Although some present-day libertarians advocate laissez-faire capitalism and strong private property rights,  such as in land, infrastructure and natural resources, others, notably libertarian socialists,  seek to abolish capitalism and private ownership of the means of production in favor of their common or cooperative ownership and management.   While minarchists believe a limited centralized government is necessary to protect individuals and their property from certain transgressions, anarchists propose to completely eliminate the state as an illegitimate political system.    The term libertarianism originally referred to a philosophical belief in free will but later became associated with anti-state socialism and Enlightenment-influenced   political movements critical of institutional authority believed to serve forms of social domination and injustice. While it has generally retained its earlier political usage as a synonym for either social or individualist anarchism through much of the world, in the United States it has since come to describe pro-capitalist economic liberalism more so than radical, anti-capitalist egalitarianism. In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, libertarianism is defined as the moral view that agents initially fully own themselves and have certain moral powers to acquire property rights in external things.  As individualist opponents of social liberalism embraced the label and distanced themselves from the word liberal, American writers, political parties and think tanks adopted the word libertarian to describe advocacy of capitalist free market economics and a night-watchman state.

BestOfReports,2lnhnb,maybesaydie,1 point,Sun Nov 9 02:32:08 2014 UTC,"It's always something, right? Nice to see you in the wild."
BestOfReports,2llmcs,heatheranne,12,Fri Nov 7 18:18:39 2014 UTC,"They do have a point, though..."
BestOfReports,2llmcs,winter_storm,4,Fri Nov 7 21:00:09 2014 UTC,"Maybe not to kill though. I'm as blue pill as they come, but I'd never want to kill a redpiller even if I do find them repulsive."
BestOfReports,2llmcs,moozie,4,Fri Nov 7 21:11:00 2014 UTC,I don't know...some of them are so far beyond repulsive that they make repulsive look adorable.
BestOfReports,2llmcs,winter_storm,2,Fri Nov 7 21:16:10 2014 UTC,Red pill and blue pill? Did I miss something else in the matrix series.   I don't understand
BestOfReports,2llmcs,Bosses_Boss,5,Sat Nov 8 00:27:47 2014 UTC,"/r/theredpill is a supposed ""pick-up artist"" subreddit which is infamous for promoting misogyny and their belief in ""Alpha Male"" theory and the idea that women exist and evolved mainly to have sex and reproduce, and that that is the primary purpose of women in life. According to many submitters and commentors, it is just natural female nature to be horny and submissive to stronger men, and women doing otherwise are either weak, Feminazis, or just faking/denying it. There's even a sort-of popular belief that women who don't have sex deserve rape [+9 Karma]. Not everyone there is that extreme, but it is still prevalent, especially among the mods and ""Endorsed Contributors"", to the point where I'd say that's the general message the sub aims to give off. /r/thebluepill is a counter-movement, like /r/conspiratard is to /r/conspiracy."
BestOfReports,2llmcs,Namington,1 point,Sat Nov 8 03:27:10 2014 UTC,Well damn. Thanks for the explanation.
BestOfReports,2lj5rq,CrypticCraig,5,Fri Nov 7 00:44:20 2014 UTC,Well he obviously isn't trying hard enough
BestOfReports,2ljkai,Bosses_Boss,3,Fri Nov 7 03:01:49 2014 UTC,Ya. I am not sure why I approved it really.
BestOfReports,2lg4yi,Bosses_Boss,4,Thu Nov 6 05:33:40 2014 UTC,Are you saying you bought banished?
BestOfReports,2lg4yi,Arama,3,Thu Nov 6 21:00:09 2014 UTC,Ha. Nope.
BestOfReports,2lgb0y,ani625,1 point,Thu Nov 6 06:52:07 2014 UTC,It has 1 point. Is that the new threshold for being distinguished?  EDIT: I'm distinguished! :)  EDIT2: I'm not distinguished :(
BestOfReports,2lgb0y,Arama,5,Thu Nov 6 22:16:27 2014 UTC,"Distinguished means the mod highlighted his own post as a mod post.  Ordinarily when a mod makes a comment it just looks like a normal comment, but if you want to distinguish it, you have to click an extra button down by 'report.' Your name will change to green and there will be a green [M] by your name. Mostly done when you want to feel important."
BestOfReports,2lgcuy,enchilado,1 point,Thu Nov 6 07:16:24 2014 UTC,To be fair it is /r/Minecraft  Right?
BestOfReports,2lf23l,ImNotJesus,7,Wed Nov 5 23:24:50 2014 UTC,Not sure if thats his fear or if he is reporting the reporters.....
BestOfReports,2lf23l,Motha_Effin_Kitty_Yo,3,Thu Nov 6 03:11:10 2014 UTC,"Huh,"
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,GodOfAtheism,24,Wed Nov 5 14:05:26 2014 UTC,Mod posts complaining about reports are just begging for reports. I think there's a rule somewhere.
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,weezer3989,2,Wed Nov 5 15:36:47 2014 UTC,I've only gotten about 5 or so in the one subreddit where I've needed to make a post about it.
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,V2Blast,17,Thu Nov 6 05:07:11 2014 UTC,"Well if you'd quit sexualizing minors, this wouldn't be an issue."
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,venn177,6,Wed Nov 5 23:46:16 2014 UTC,Can I ask what the numbers next to each line mean?
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,KharlanTree,22,Wed Nov 5 16:20:35 2014 UTC,How many people reported for that reason.
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,noeatnosleep,9,Wed Nov 5 16:32:53 2014 UTC,"Ah ok, thanks! I thought it might be that but was confused since the numbers in the picture don't add up to 338."
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,KharlanTree,10,Wed Nov 5 17:09:19 2014 UTC,"Those would just be the new ones, I believe."
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,noeatnosleep,6,Wed Nov 5 17:12:45 2014 UTC,Ooooh that makes sense. Thanks man for explaining it!
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,KharlanTree,3,Wed Nov 5 17:17:04 2014 UTC,"Too many different report reasons and it only shows the top 10ish. When the rest are all 1 report, I'm guessing they go by earliest first."
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,V2Blast,3,Thu Nov 6 05:47:54 2014 UTC,"Odd; sometimes I'll see posts with ""reports: 1"" and then expanding it shows ""2: <no reason>"""
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,elfa82,2,Thu Nov 6 05:07:48 2014 UTC,That usually means that it had been approved once already after the first report
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,V2Blast,2,Thu Nov 6 06:45:53 2014 UTC,Not quite; I see it on a few posts that haven't already been approved (otherwise they'd have the checkmark).
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,noeatnosleep,1 point,Thu Nov 6 07:13:46 2014 UTC,That's usually a mobile client.
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,V2Blast,1 point,Thu Nov 6 12:48:23 2014 UTC,"The ""no reason"" thing may be because of mobile clients (or maybe people selecting ""other"" and not giving a reason), yes, but I'm talking about the number of reports not matching up with the number next to the report reasons."
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,noeatnosleep,1 point,Fri Nov 7 00:29:12 2014 UTC,I'm talking about the number of reports not matching up with the number next to the report reasons.   I believe that's because it is only showing the ones that are new since OP has checked last.
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,V2Blast,1 point,Fri Nov 7 12:33:00 2014 UTC,"I'm referring to my own experience, when this happens for posts that haven't been approved by any mods yet. Sorry for not being clear :P"
BestOfReports,2ld7xt,UglierThanMoe,4,Sat Nov 8 07:29:42 2014 UTC,you brought this on yourselves   Hard to disagree with that.
BestOfReports,2lc5m9,Motha_Effin_Kitty_Yo,6,Wed Nov 5 04:38:37 2014 UTC,I'm not sure I understand what possessed them to report it for that.
BestOfReports,2lc5m9,VIOLENT_POOP,13,Wed Nov 5 06:04:30 2014 UTC,The OP said it was a mini-bear. Liar!
BestOfReports,2lcnz4,_Vote_,3,Wed Nov 5 08:39:17 2014 UTC,There was no conversation leading up to this.
BestOfReports,2lcnz4,TyeDyeGuy21,2,Wed Nov 5 08:40:07 2014 UTC,I feel like this report will never get old.
BestOfReports,2lcnz4,venn177,2,Wed Nov 5 16:37:28 2014 UTC,ikr: In kids' rectums.
BestOfReports,2lcnz4,Renegade_Meister,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:47:05 2014 UTC,"If it was LKR instead of IKR, it could stand for ""Little Kids Rock"""
BestOfReports,2lcnz4,Fingebimus,1 point,Thu Nov 6 22:03:04 2014 UTC,It's weird that that report even is so standard. I think a lot of people just press it because it looks funny.
