I suppose it's politically good they're dragging gay men into this nonsense so we all have to deal with it.  Gay men have been pretty sheltered beyond this drag stuff. Maybe they'll finally understand how gay men are utterly demonized by the T.   There is, by the by, a fantastic scene in Paris is Burning where one of the queens, one who has sheltered many gay men and trans women, outright says ""I don't know what it's like to feel like a woman; I've never been pregnant or had a cycle. I only know what it's like to be a man emulating a woman."" He'd actually taken hormones before... and then he then proceeds to describe numerous gay men who have gotten SRS because they thought they'd be treated better by society -- and then regretted it. It's just awful that this person who lived through AIDS and all kinds of incredibly real shit and who clearly cares about his community (both the gay men and the trans women) would be tossed under the bus as transphobic now."

If everything around you casts doubt on your ""identity"", maybe its because your ""identity"" is so eminently doubtful. If you smell shit everywhere you go check your own shoes ... etc.  Honestly, this is a really interesting thing to have happened, because it shows how different the attitudes of women and trans women are to things that are 'offensive' to them. Drag queens are directly 'offensive' to women - not trans women. They are the sexist equivalent of black face. ... And yet because they offend trans women, they are straight-out banned. It's actually staggering. Women are used to being the butt of jokes; they're used to accommodating other people ... because they have to be used to it. But once again, the only thing that makes trans women women is that they like to call themselves one, and everyone else has to bend to cater to their delusion.  I don't blame people for going to such lengths to avoid offending trans women. It's like adults who go to great lengths to hide from their kids that santa isn't real. The delusion is so fragile, you have to work hard to maintain it, otherwise you're being mean to someone who is very fragile. Their entire identity relies on the good will of people pretending to believe them, even though literally nobody does. Nobody sees e.g. Caitlyn Jenner as a woman.

It seems like being publicly female and 'presenting as female' (to use queer-theory terminology) follows quite different principles from being publicly male. And as such, if 'being female' itself is a bit of an act, in a way that 'being male' isn't, this casts a bit of a different light on what it might mean when someone says they are 'trans female'.  Let me illustrate. As a male, between waking up and going to work I wash my hair, shave, and put a T-shirt, jeans and running shoes on. I can't think of anything whatsoever that I do to make my appearance 'acceptably masculine'. On extremely formal occasions I wear a suit, but that's maybe three times a year.  It seems like for the average working female in an office job, she'd do a lot more than that to appear 'acceptably female'. Looking at the women I see going to work on the train, most of them have   some amount of makeup/foundation/eye makeup/lip gloss - even 'natural look' is quite heavily made up jewelry - big earrings, necklace long hair - even 'short hair' on females would be long hair on men - that's got to be a bitch to maintain! female dress - often exposing way more chest/legs/arms/stomach than any man would accessories/handbag high heel shoes (about half the women I see wear them) increasingly, visible 'pretty' tattoos   Now, I don't think women are born doing any of this stuff. It seems to be all pretty non-essential.    Trans women and drag queens make a mockery by overdoing it and treating womanface like womanhood.    But it seems like if a woman refused to participate in these markers of femaleness which I listed above, her femininity might be called into question. What do you think?  So okay. To what extent is 'being female' itself just a function of all this 'womanface' ornamental stuff that women do? And what's the gender-critical perspective on it? I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.   If a woman sees that she gains opportunity by conforming to a stereotype, can you blame her for doing it?    I don't see there's a moral problem with any of it, so it's not a question of blame, just understanding why there's buy-in to sex conformity.   I wouldn't say we get much choice about wearing makeup and high heels, when we recognize that women pretty much have to do those things to achieve success in other areas.    I'd say that everyone has a choice. OK, I made a choice to be sex-nonconforming myself when I came out as gay, which certainly cost me some professional success. It's just a question of the costs involved."

Gender_Critical,3e1knr,Astraloid,17,Tue Jul 21 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"Not all women do that, of course.  Just an anecdote here, but as a female, in between waking up and going to work I wash my face, dunk my hair in the sink, and put on a polo shirt, jeans, and sneakers. Possibly a hoodie. I carry my stuff in a backpack. Get haircuts at the barbershop, FWIW. My hair is pretty damn short, it's cut with clippers.  Makeup? Never worn it in my entire life outside of a stage show.  I'm a programmer, work inside, lead people even. No one has any doubt that I'm female.  Yes, I got some shit for not conforming, mainly when I was younger. Often with women it comes out as criticism for being ""childish"" at the point when you refuse the heels, makeup, and ""sexified"" clothing in particular.  Yes, there are jobs that likely would not want me to dress this way - but on the other hand, plenty of jobs aren't about to let you (a male) get away with jeans and a t-shirt, either. You would need a full on suit plus tie, probably somewhat restricted in design, rules on hair.  Thinking about it honestly and just looking at other women around me in some of those ""suit required"" jobs I think that at my age in particular I could get away with a conservative suit (pants or skirt below the knee, for me), a nice pair of flat shoes (think similar to wingtips, but more streamlined) and still no makeup. I've done this look before too, the main question I would get then is if I'm religious.  Mind you I do agree that there are more ""rules"" on women's appearance in a lot of situations, and while you can break them there is certainly some social pressure if you do. Interestingly enough it seems really short hair on women is considered more ""normal"" once it's grey, ha.  That said though the entire concept of the dressing up being considered ""presenting female"" annoys me no end. I'm female from birth and never dressed this way, and someone else dressing that way doesn't make them female if they're not.  The fact that people who don't pass (if we're being honest, that's what the main elephant in the room is) have to wear all these ""signals"" to let people know what's going on just reinforces this idea that ""the dress makes the woman"" and so yeah, that annoys a lot of traditional feminists."

I'm not an expert on feminism, but I know that's part of the theory.  You say there's no comparison, but we're talking about men and women doing the exact same things: putting makeup and dress on and claiming to be women. That surely invites some kind of comparison.  That's also where the blackface comparison falls down: black people are born looking that way, whereas looking 'stereotypically female' is about the acoutrements, the hair, the nails, the makeup, the dresses, etc.   Womenhood does not exist for men to exploit.

Because I've just heard from u/Herzegovagina[1]  that women don't have a choice on the matter.   You're kind of missing that both points are interlocking.  ""Femininity"" is a construct that makes us associate dresses, long hair, makeup, high heels, and shaved body hair with female bodies.    Women who wish to succeed must often conform to these ideals of femininity.  In the work place, women who wear makeup and heels are more likely to find upward mobility, and to be taken much more seriously.  In this instance, the women who dress this way are doing it ""because they like to"", because it helps them get what they need in order to be taken seriously.  Many women also deform their feet to the point of only being able to wear heels comfortably so that's also a (sad) possibility.   That's also where the blackface comparison falls down: black people are born looking that way, whereas looking 'stereotypically female' is about the acoutrements, the hair, the nails, the makeup, the dresses, etc.   I don't know if I agree with this either.  ""Blackface"" is not 'what black people look like'.  It's often times black paint with huge outlined red lips and fake gold teeth, awful wigs and caricatures of gangster or pimp clothing.  Obviously there are other instances that are less extreme, but it's got a lot of that same ""Exaggerated Features That Are Not Based in Reality"".  The womanface thing is similar, with not just the hair & makeup, but corsets and hip molds  and face contouring in order to give them the illusion of what we perceive to be ""female""...because it resembles femininity.  So what we would like to achieve is to separate ""femininity"" from that constructed idea of womanhood and leave womanhood to simply mean ""being female"", much like with femininity.  My tuxedo is feminine because I'm female, my short hair is feminine because I'm female.  A man in a dress is masculine because he's male.  Etc.   However because we do not live in a vacuum, it is impossible to simply divorce that at the straight away.  A woman performing femininity (makeup, long hair, dresses) in order to get a leg up where women are already paid less and struggle to find footing in a professional environment is a choice that she makes.

Gender_Critical,3duyu6,veronalady,8,Mon Jul 20 21:21:33 2015 UTC,"Transgender people who identify as lesbian/gay are radically different from transgender people who identify as straight, in terms of morphology.  This blog is pretty great in talking about neuroscience and psychology research related to transgender people. If you look around, you'll come across the two-fold typology of transgender men (homosexual and non-homosexual). These groups are very different. Homosexual transgender men (biological males attracted to other males) transition much younger (20's or younger), are more ""feminine"" in childhood behavior, and do not report sexual arousal from wearing women's clothing. Non homosexual transgender men (biological males attracted to females) transition much later (30's-40's+), are more gender-normative in childhood, often are/were married with children, and often report sexual arousal in wearing women's clothing. This latter group is often referred to as autogynephiles.   In other words, the would-be gay children are transed. It's the white, middle-class married men who decide they're women that go on to call themselves lesbian."

Gender_Critical,3drc9z,DoctorAtreides,10,Sat Jul 18 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"Here's the important part:   Dr Verma’s other main finding is that most of these differences are not congenital. Rather, they develop with age. Her volunteers ranged from 8 to 22 years old. The brains of boys and girls aged 8 to 13 demonstrated only a few differences, though all were of the type that later became pronounced. Adolescents, those aged 13 to 17, showed more. Young adults, over 17, more still. Sex differences in brains—those visible to this technique, at least—thus manifest themselves mainly when sex itself begins to matter.   I just realized this article is couple years old. For some reason, it was making the rounds on my Twitter this morning."
Gender_Critical,3drc9z,liatris,3,Sat Jul 18 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"So, doesn't ""with age"" imply ""with puberty?"" Did they compare brains before and after puberty? If not, that seems like a pretty big oversight. A 8 year old and a 13 year are pretty different."
Gender_Critical,3drc9z,berindekamats,5,Tue Jul 21 03:59:20 2015 UTC,Cool. I think some of these differences are caused by hormones at puberty and some are due to socialization.

People always mistook me for a boy. On special occasions, I would have to wear dresses but, other than that, I’d throw a tantrum.   Girls aren't interested in sports:   By 14, I wasn’t interested in sports or associating with any of the masculine things at all.    You have to fit into one category or the other:   There’s male, female and I don’t fit into either of those. What I feel right now is a-gender.   If you're not comfortable with being a girl, you aren't.   I never was comfortable with being a girl. I wore a dress once when I was 5 and I was screaming: “No! Take me out of this!” I cut my hair when I was 15. Before that, I wore it up and wore hats.    Girls always experiment with makeup. Boys never do:   In Grade 10 I started experimenting with makeup, but I still identified as male because I didn’t know anything else.   Boys don't do gymnastics, figure skating, or ballet:   It never occurred to me that I might be a girl. But I went and did traditionally female activities, like ballet, gymnastics and figure skating. I had long hair throughout most of my childhood. I didn’t really click until I moved to a more urban area."

Gender non-conforming and I wanted to be a boy so badly because of unconscious beliefs I had about girls I felt I could not or never wanted to be. I ""identified"" more with the ""boy"" role of being active and decisive.   But it was all unconscious. As in, I wasn't aware of any of those feelings until I was almost 30. If adults had told me as a teenager it was possible to be a boy after all, I may never have healed and become my whole self. My son would not exist.   This is scary stuff. Do they not understand that most of these kids would have grown through it and ended up better for it, or do they just not care??"
Gender_Critical,3dqdpo,itazurakko,5,Sun Jul 19 13:03:40 2015 UTC,"If adults had told me as a teenager it was possible to be a boy after all, I may never have healed and become my whole self.   Aside from this thread I'm watching the ""Growing up Trans"" documentary (an episode of Frontline, broadcast on PBS) - it's a good show.  It has me thinking some of these same thoughts though. There are some really young children, they are gender non-conforming and suffering for it socially, and they get introduced to the trans thing, and are told that they can ""change sex"" later on. Their families help them ""socially transition"" at school in lower elementary. No medical intervention is needed yet, obviously.  And so, they are keeping this idea in their head, that it's possible, though not always realistically at all (some of the interviews are really hard to listen to).  Then it comes time for puberty, and the kids are (understandably) horrified at the idea that they will start developing in a different way from their friends.  So at that point, the adults will say, well, see, they persisted, so they must be ""truly trans"" or whatever. And they're obviously very distressed now, so yes, we need to do the blockers. So they go on hormone blockers. But then in a few short years, at ages like 13 (below the currently recommended age of 16) they're on cross-sex hormones, and giving up fertility (again, some of those interviews are hard to listen to).  ...and I can't help but wonder, how things would be different if the parents were 100% on board letting the kids do and present as they want, maybe even letting them switch pronouns if they want, in elementary, but instead of ""you can change sex when you're older"" telling them ""you can do and dress and date however you want, but your body is the type of body that will end up physically looking more like Dad, rather than Mom"" - or looking like this femmy male star, or whatever.   I.e., getting them used to the idea. Making sure they know, too, that their bodies don't define them. Trying to slowly manage the dysphoria. Introducing them to gender non-conforming adults and role models to just show them what's possible.   People are always saying ""what harm does it do to allow 'social transition' as little kids?"" and as far as it goes I don't think there is any (though honestly I don't see why it needs to be called any sort of ""transitioning"" though) but when it comes with this fuzzy promise (that the kids don't seem to understand) that they will BE the other sex, as adults, with just a little intervention, I wonder if it's actually prolonging this belief of being in the ""wrong"" body and therefore causing them to fulfill the ""are they persisting?"" test for ""do we start blockers/cross sex hormones"" criteria that comes later. Can some of this be self-fulfilling?  As always too there's a lot of ""I will not let my kid do [whatever behavior] UNLESS we decide formally that this is a social transition and then we go whole hog into it and buy the new wardrobe and all the rest"" going on.  Anyway, a thought-provoking program. With the really little kids who are told that they've ""transitioned"" at age 5 and whatever I do think this is a new phenomenon that raises some different questions than even the ""came out to my parents in high school after puberty was well underway"" situations (which are really the youngest self-reporting on the net so far just due to timing)."
Gender_Critical,3dqdpo,goneharolding,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"Can it be self-fulfilling? Absolutely! People often underestimate what ""faith"" can do outside of a religious context. But it seems to work that way, and evidence against can seem especially insignificant if everyone around you agrees. Even be overlooked.  But I think the most sickening part is how they think they're encouraging them to be themselves, when what they're really doing is perpetuating both the pain and the system causing it. It's so sad how empathy can be hijacked by bad ideas."
Gender_Critical,3dqdpo,itazurakko,2,Sun Jul 19 19:49:58 2015 UTC,"encouraging them to be themselves   This is the other thing I really don't get - this extreme alienation of the body as somehow being other than part of ""themselves.""  We are born with a brain and develop a personality in it, we are also born with a physical body that is just as much ""us"" as our brains are. Actually accepting your ""true self"" would be to accept both of these as being a valid combination that has occurred in you, a valid human being that is part of the wide diversity of humanity.  There's nothing about your body and mind that needs to ""match"" - they already match, because they occurred together, and there's nothing dysfunctional about the body (and spare me the intersex anecdotes - these are perfectly normally functioning bodies we're talking about, nothing at all unusual about them).  Some people can't manage to do this in a world that is hypergendered, and I do have sympathy for that situation. Getting bodymods to no longer seem gender non-conforming can make life a lot easier. But it is capitulating to ""gender,"" and to the hypergendered society, not actually groundbreaking or genderbending or anything of the sort.  One of the kids in the Frontline documentary talks about this straight up - Ariel, the kid who was obsessed with Disney princesses. Ariel points out that the hardest part of all was being a BOY who was into that stuff and wanting to wear the princess dresses. Once he got the ""social transition"" done, things became socially a lot easier, because now he's a ""girl into Disney princesses"" (though he was accidentally outed and so his friends did find out he's trans, just after already being friends).  But Ariel is one of the harder interviews to listen to, as the therapist brings up fertility and having kids, and he definitely wants to have ""babies,"" but not via SPERM (or as Ariel puts it, ""from my boy body""), and he talks about already at such a tender age not being able to deal with it when female friends bring up having kids or wonder if they'll be able to deal with the pain of childbirth, because he can't bear the thought of not having them ""from a girl body.""  Honest truth is, that kid has a male body and the only way to ever have biokids is via sperm. It's a harsh truth, surely, but it is what it is. You can have all the cosmetic surgeries in the world and that is not gonna change. So he has to get used to it - either finish ""transition"" on schedule (so no male puberty happening, meaning no sperm to freeze, meaning no biokids, but he keeps the ""not ruined by male puberty"" body) OR pausing transition to make sperm (meaning getting some unwanted other physical changes) and going that route. Kid is THIRTEEN.  It just seems to me listening to some of the interviews that while everyone is meaning well, there are kids being led to believe that they are really going to change sex and not seeing these actual realities - which is expected, since they're so young."
Gender_Critical,3dqdpo,goneharolding,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:53:18 2015 UTC,"I admit to not having actually watched it, I think it would be more upsetting than I'm prepared to deal with right now. But somewhere on a different thread I called that body-mind separation ""weird, retro Cartesian bullshit"" because it really harkens back to that old religious idea, Descartes' idea of the body and soul as two things, one profane and one sacred. It's deeply rooted in Western thought, but this is a new wrinkle.  And it's weird how they at the same time deny physical reality, yet are obsessed with it. What you describe about that little boy is so sad, he needs therapy and love, not coddling and ""acceptance."" What is so awful about a boy in a dress?? I fear the fallout from these experiments will be big and under-publicized."
Gender_Critical,3dqdpo,itazurakko,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:39 2015 UTC,"18 y.o. F2T who has been on testosterone for three years (so started cross-sex hormones at 15, for those keeping score at home) says this:   Today, I’m not comfortable with having lots of male friends because I feel I can’t connect on a lot of bases. Sometimes I’m like, “Dude, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” I find guys harder to talk to. I was raised as a girl and I had a younger sister and all my cousins were girls. That’s who I was comfortable talking to. Even though I’ve always felt so male, it’s such a different experience when people identify you that way right off the bat. I’m trying to adapt to male everything.   I've seen this sort of sentiment in quite a few F2T stories I've read and on quite a few blogs, people saying that while they like to hang out with other F2T, they are uncomfortable around ""cis men.""  ...which makes me wonder just how they know that they ""always felt so male."" I mean, if you are feeling so male that supposedly you have a male brain, shouldn't you get along with plenty of other ""male brain"" people just fine?  It seems once puberty hits a lot of F2T are hanging together and sort of having their own version of ""dudebro"" culture (often exaggeratedly so) but amongst themselves.  19 y.o. M2T who came out at 16 and went ""full time"" at 18 (so, one year ago):   Now I present as female 50 per cent of the time. If I feel girly today, I’ll wear a dress. Another day, I’ll be lazy and wear jeans and a T-shirt. I don’t hate how I look.   Why is ""presenting female"" about wearing a dress? Plenty of women are lazy and wear jeans and a T-shirt frequently, and they are not any less ""dressing like women"" for it.   (Yes, I get it - when you don't pass well, you need the dress to really make the intentions obvious. But language like this is really annoying to, well, WOMEN.)  18 y.o. ""non-binary"" M2T:   There’s male, female and I don’t fit into either of those. What I feel right now is a-gender. There are so many things that a human is and can be. I define myself by my interests and by my personality.   ...as do most people on Planet Earth. But what on earth do ""interests"" and ""personality"" have to do with whether you're male or female, which is about reproduction?   When I was growing up, all my best friends were girls. I put makeup on and played with Barbies. But I never treated these as feminine activities. I just thought I was playing with toys because I’m a kid (I also played with RC cars).   You had it right! It's a bummer that you later have body image issues. So now you have bodymods, you're certainly free to do that.  The stories about the male kids getting bullied for wearing makeup or dressing too ""femmy"" are sad. :( Whether those people ""transition"" OR not, that sort of thing is just not ok.  I notice too several stories of hair policing in there. What is it about parents being so insistently strict about their kids' hairstyles???  Another M2T writes:   One of the things that adults don’t seem to get is that identities are fluid. A person may come out as a trans woman one year and five years later come out as non-binary. Identities might change and they might not.    No doubt I'm one of the fogeys referred to here. I'll admit, I don't get this entire obsession with ""identity"" AT ALL to even start with, and nothing limited to transgender either.  It seems people are spending endless amounts of energy navel-gazing and introspecting and trying to find the precise label for a box which they are then going to step into. They spend hours online talking and arguing with people the precise definitions of the exact borders of the various boxes, and the exact way to apply the ever changing labels to their specific box, and how to broadcast to the world just what exact box they're in.  Why? Why not just do your own thing and quit obsessing over the labels? Why not focus on what you can DO rather than some nebulous notions of ""who you are?"" You're you, that's all you need.  Sometimes I honestly wonder if this obsession with... metadata, basically, is correlated with the rise of all these social networking services that are constantly telling you to search for other people based on some laundry list of ""identity"" features."

I have more body hair than I'd like, too, and my face could certainly be more feminine (meaning neotenic) looking. Maybe I'm really a trans-transwoman?  I've entertained the notion of going to a gender counselor or some such professional to tell them this to try and get laser hair removal and plastic surgery recommended just for the hell of it, for but I know it wouldn't work. Drat. It would be fascinating to see how they treat my sadness at not looking hyperfeminine, compared to how they treat men's. I'm willing to bet most female adolescents feel dysphoric at times when they think of their bodies, but apparently that isn't something that is considered medically necessary to fix (even though the dissatisfaction with appearance will likely persist into adulthood). See, when women are upset because they don't look/feel 'womanly' enough, it's just them being vain, but when men don't look/feel 'womanly' (which usually means pornified...) enough, they need plastic surgery/hair removal to fix it."

You're not educated on genetics.    0.2% of men have an extra X chromosome in some or all of their genetic profile, therefore there's no connection between sex and genes. Checkmate, feminists!  Then this happened:   Shapiro: Would you like to discuss the genetics? What are your genetics?   On the ball with that one.    I... Zoe I'd stay away from the genetics and [go] back to the brain scans.    Get with the picture, Zoe. Stick to the propaganda angle we discussed!   Tur: [grabbing Shapiro's neck] You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.  Shapiro: Now that seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion  [Argument with multiple talking simultaneously]    Now I know, but wait, but to be fair... but to be fair you were being kind of rude, and that's not fair.     Don't you realize you inviting physical violence upon yourself by not having the proper political opinions? Consider yourself lucky you weren't threatened with dying in a fire for those pronouns.   Shapiro: I'm sorry,  Tur: You just called me sir.  Shapiro: It's not rude to say that someone who's biologically a male is a male.  Tur: You just called me sir.  Shapiro: Someone who's biologically male is a male     But Mr. Shapiro, you know, you knew very well that saying that to zoe would be -- would be egregiously insulting.      The other reporters are practically jumping at the chance to defend Tur after he physically threatened Shapiro because he won't stop recognizing the existence of human reproductive biology. What the fuck   Shapiro: The entire discussion is whether we are embracing delusion and mental illness as a society   ...for the sake of patriarchy  And then that tag at the end by the reporter in the blue dress... So rehearsed. So fake. So utterly without logic. Wow."

Shapiro comes in at around 3:54 and asks ""why are we mainstreaming delusion?"" He then goes on to try and discuss biology and genetics. He is the only panel member who hasn't drunk the transgender Kool-Aid. Seriously 5 panel members plus Dr. Drew vs Shapiro, with Drew priming the transgender person to keep him on message. Keep in mind, the media doesn't have a bias....So, when he opens his mouth, the other panelist pounce on him, but he keeps his cool. Shapiro is one of those rare people that seems to get calmer when confronted with verbal aggression. Since he's not folding to verbal bullying and intimadation by the group, the transgender person next to him, puts his arm on Ben yet again (the trans guy has been touching Ben over and over at this point, it seems like a very alpha male domination move imo), grabs him around the neck rather tightly it seems, looks him square in the eye and threatens him physically with this very low, rather terrifying masculine voice. Then the rest of the panel members rush in to defend that violence. Implying Ben has some how brought this on himself for being disrespectful and daring to call a man ""sir"" and asking him about his personal genetics after the guy brought up genetic abnormalities. lmao Not one single panel member is brave enough to condemn the transgendered person for resorting to violence. It's just Looney Tunes.   edited: Here is Ben discussing the events on his radio show, what happened during commercial breaks and after the show. I didn't watch the whole episode but I imagine the clips Ben plays are more interesting than sitting through that whole circlejerk anyway. Apparently the transgender person went on to insult Ben as ""a little man"" repeatedly. Ben is a little man lol, he like 5' 7"" with a slim build. Why exactly is that an insult unless someone is trying to imply that a man being slight of build makes him less masculine? I find gendered insults coming from someone who claims to want gender acceptance to be just so friggin funny. The black guy on the panel also accused Ben of hating black people for some reason which is kind of bizarre.   Anyway, Shapiro says he has spoken to a detective in LA County who has confirmed the behavior meets the definition of battery, especially since the guy continued to physically threaten to ""curb stomp"" him on Twitter. Ben says he's going to press charges which I think is pretty brave. He's sure to get a lot of flak for going to the police."

It is, but bear in mind he's a reporter for Breitbart, so his social circle probably includes a lot of people who haven't drunk the Koolaid.  (And we know his employer supports him, lol.)

But he is very quick to switch to physical and verbal intimidation where he is straight up alpha dogging Shapiro because he is physically smaller.

For some, the aim is not just to avoid sexual assault, but to feel more at home in public space, which in Egypt is traditionally seen as a male domain. It allows girls to smoke, shout, or simply sit in the street, actions that boys can easily do without reproach, but girls can’t. Amira El Feky, a former academic who has researched this topic, explains: “All the privileges that men have – they can have them. They mock the whole idea of gender, they say: ‘Oh you think women are weak? Well I’m just not going to be a woman any more.’”"

Gender_Critical,3cuapd,Astraloid,9,Mon Jul 20 22:44:33 2015 UTC,"Thing is, this part   People are assigned a sex before they are even able to produce gametes. Some of those people will never produce gametes. What we are then referring to with sex is expected or potential gamete production. Much in the same way anti-abortionists think of women as existing in a lifelong state of potential pregnancy. All of these labels are projections of societal expectations, not factual accounts.   ...actually makes some sense. This is WHY the whole ""oh yeah? Well if a woman has a hysterectomy is she no longer a woman to you????"" stupid argument that the people trying to erase ""woman"" as a class constantly make is so transparently stupid and derailing.  HOWEVER.  Being born with a penis is a biological fact that either happens to you or it doesn't.   The presence or absence of the penis is OBSERVED as neutral physical fact when you are an infant.  The presence of the penis is what gets you shunted into upbringing as a BOY (if you have a penis, completely 100% regardless about your feels on the matter or if you have dysphoria later or if you hate the idea of being a boy or not, you're a BOY).  Similarly if you lack a penis, you're a GIRL. Doesn't matter how you feel about anything. Doesn't matter if you will actually be impregnable as an adult, or if you end up childfree or anything else.   Gender is the oppression of people (women, specifically) based on their physical traits as infants (lacking a penis) completely 100% unrelated to anyone's feels on anything and completely orthogonal to other axes of oppression they might be on.  So the only way to change things is to ABOLISH GENDER.  Welcome aboard."
Gender_Critical,3cuapd,itazurakko,4,Sat Jul 11 15:46:49 2015 UTC,"I like your post, but classifying women/girls as simply ""not having a penis"" seems sexist. Women/girls are classified as female if we have a vulva and vagina. Males are not the default sex."
Gender_Critical,3cuapd,Outsidethetriangle,6,Sat Jul 11 22:39:35 2015 UTC,"Granted.  My only point was to emphasize that the classification happens based on the genitalia at birth and does involve a lot of assumptions - no one is actually doing chromosomal tests on babies or really knowing if any given baby is going to end up actually fertile or producing biokids or not, and any acquired trauma to the sex organs doesn't magically remove someone from one's sex category.   When it comes to women, it's about being assumed to eventually be able to become pregnant and bear offspring (so yeah as you say, having the female genitalia parts for starters), regardless of if it's actually true in the particular case or not.  Not all women can become pregnant, but that doesn't make them not women - and YET, that also doesn't mean (at all!) that male babies (born with a penis, and hence socialized as boys) who later have their penis removed and/or fashioned into a facsimile of a vulva are somehow ""just the same as infertile women (so how dare you speak of a distinction at all)"" as so many activists like to claim, either.  I would say though that under the patriarchal system in many places, males are indeed considered the default sex. That's part of the problem. It's why so many things assume that women should be able to empathize and identify with a male protagonist, but any media with a woman or girl as the protagonist must be ""for women"" specialist targeted media because of course no men can identify with such a lead character. 100% agreed that it SHOULDN'T be that way though, most definitely."

We wanted it because it is a basic human right for women who have birthed, and all but 2 nations worldwide have it.

It's in vogue to be progressive and so it's really easy to be progressive, you just need to accept whatever seems a little bit out of the mainstream. Anyone who doesn't is conservative and bad.  The ardency that characterizes progressivism along with this black and white thinking means that it's extremely easy to be written off as the enemy, that encouraging consciousness is considered shady.  Learning, being taught the progressive way to speak and act, is the end all of thought. Being progressive isn't supposed to require extensive thinking, it's supposed to ""just make sense."" This goes a long ways toward explaining why so many of us reached peak trans before we became critical when we were banned or shunned because we just started asking questions. I suspect that few people who are critical of gender come to it by being talked into it.  I'm uncomfortable with the GC subreddits linking to conservative sites for a lot of reasons. One, it does conflate our reasoning and motives with conservative ones. We can understand the nuances and see that we're only linking to a particular article because it's the only source offering a non-overtly-genderist lens to a story, but other people aren't going to see that and are going to turn heel when they come across it. There's also the concern about driving site views and spreading the name of conservative groups.  But it's also concerning because we're letting conservative content that conservatives are writing be a substitute for the gender critical writings that feminists are not writing.

Transgender ideology is conservative to its core and is mostly espoused by centrists and those immediately to their left and their right. Why is it conservative? Because it's the mirror image of ""traditional"" gospel about what gender means, that if you are born with a certain sex you have to look and behave a certain way. Transgender ideology is the mirror of that: if you look and behave a certain way you must be a certain sex, and if you're not then you should ""transition."" But it's all of a piece. It's all the exact same mindset. Sex and behavior must match, even if the behavior has exactly zero to do with reproduction.  YOU helped make this. YOU refused to understand that girls are not born in dresses and boys are not born clutching toy trucks and that people can do whatever they want to do and whatever suits their talents if it has nothing to do with making a baby. Because THAT IS ALL SEX IS FOR, right? That's what YOU tell us, each and every day. So what in the world you think the sexes have to do with, say, playing sports or fighting for our country or running a government or owning property, I really wish I knew.  It's no wonder they're confused... we're ALL confused, and trans and their allies just happen to be the least mentally stable amongst us when it comes to sex and gender.  Many of us here on the actual Left see what is happening and don't like it one bit, but if we dare speak up we are shouted down and no-platformed. I want a world where people can wear whatever the hell they want and pursue whatever interests they have that don't harm others, but I also want a world where I don't have to worry about some pervy crossdresser with a sex-crime record peeking into my stall while I'm taking a potty break, or some naked guy hanging out in the sauna at the local gym when my daughter and I go in to change clothes.  Maybe if you guys would quit being so hateful about folks who don't conform to gender rules, and start standing up for the rights of GLBT people to live in secular society unmolested by intolerant idiots, they'd have a place to go and wouldn't feel the need to be incursive into women's spaces anymore. Or little girls' either.  In the meantime, I suppose, there's always Baden-Powell or Camp Fire. At least they plan ahead properly for coed situations.  And yes, I've noticed how ""transwomen"" are getting all the attention and praise and help while ""transmen"" are left floundering. It's not just in the Girl Scouts.

As is mentioned here elsewhere both the girls who are already members and the trans children allowed in will, under current policy be exposed to the nudity of the opposite sex.

The idea that one’s sex is fluid and a matter open to choice runs unquestioned through our culture and is reflected everywhere in the media, the theater, the classroom, and in many medical clinics. It has taken on cult-like features: its own special lingo, internet chat rooms providing slick answers to new recruits, and clubs for easy access to dresses and styles supporting the sex change. It is doing much damage to families, adolescents, and children and should be confronted as an opinion without biological foundation wherever it emerges.   An interesting article although I'm a bit confused with the conclusion. It seems to be saying that general acceptance of the transgender is causing more transgenderism, or is at least somehow generally harmful to individuals and families alike? If gender dysphoria is a psychological disorder as opposed to a discrete choice then can its occurrence be increased or decreased via larger societal attitudes? Can other mental disorders be combated this way, by making a societal shift? Seems dubious."

Gender_Critical,3ca3dj,uterusesb4duderuses,7,Mon Jul 6 13:15:31 2015 UTC,"This is a long report by the government examining the issue of sexual assault in these centers. They summarize 15 substantiated reports of sexual assault on page 60. It says 3/15 included transgender detainees. One was a trans detainee assaulted by a male detainee. Two detailed were staff-on-detainee sexual assaults. Would transferring these detainees prevent this? Are female facilities staffed by women (not that this would prevent everything, one reported assault was female staff assaulting a male detainee)? The majority of these assaults are male detainees assaulting male detainees. Are the assaults experienced by MtF detainees not part of a larger pattern? I doubt the suggested solution for the non-trans males is going to be to house them with women. I seriously doubt the solution for the even smaller minority of FtMs would be to house them with the men. 'Stick everyone in the female facilities' is not a solution.  15 reports is not exactly a huge number to work with though and makes me feel a little dubious about '1 in 5 of those sexually assaulted are trans'. If you lump the incidents of transgender victims together with the other males, then 13 out 15 of the cases examined involved male victims, and 13 out of 15 involved male perpetrators both staff and detainee. I really wish they had the sexuality of the victims. Is this a pattern of male-on-male violence? Is there a pattern of men assaulting gay men or those perceived as gay men (which would likely include the trans detainees?)?  If there truly is a pattern of sexual assault with trans victims then perhaps an area of these facilities needs to be an area for transgender/gay detainees to be housed with each other rather then sending them over to the female facilities and completely disregarding the safety of the women. But would this truly prevent these assaults if so many are male-on-male (since the trans inmates might assault each other), and if it's not uncommon for staff to assault detainees? The larger problem of male sexual violence needs addressing. But I honestly don't know how."

Gender_Critical,3ca3dj,BrotherNemesis,6,Tue Jul 7 10:57:28 2015 UTC,"A 2014 Fusion investigation found some 75 transgender detainees are held by ICE every night, less than one percent of the estimated 34,000 people held in detention. Yet trans detainees made up 1 out of 5 confirmed instances of sexual assault in immigration detention facilities.   That... is a rough statistic. After evaluating how many sexual assaults there were in total from information provided by the ACLU it seems that a trans person has about a 40%-50% of being sexually assaulted in an immigration detention facility in comparison to a less than 1% chance for a non-trans person. I feel it would likely be better for everyone involved if a small detention facility specifically for trans could be arranged, that way they could be protected from the general population and no one would worry if they were taking advantage of the population that did not share their sex. The only problem is that many facilities would consider this a waste of money and would instead just put them in solitary confinement, which, because humans are social creatures, is tantamount to torture. No easy solution presents itself but I still don't think putting trans-people in the detention facilities they feel coincide with their gender is a good idea."
Gender_Critical,3ca3dj,chasqa,2,Mon Jul 6 14:23:26 2015 UTC,"So ICE holds 34,000 detainees at any given time and in a 3 and a half year period there were 15 substantiated allegations of sexual abuse and assault. By my reckoning that makes... [err 15/3.5/.34 = ] ...  12.6 cases/100,000 people.   Doesn't that make detention in ICE one of the safest places in the USA to live? As an average over all big cities, in 2012 there were 34.5 forcible rapes/100,000 inhabitants.  Statistically I think I'm still better off being a MtT in a mens immigration facility than a woman in Chicago.  I mean nobody should have to suffer sexual abuse or assault, but in the time it took those 3 offenses against trans women in ICE to rack up, at least a  quarter of a million rapes were committed against actual women in the rest of the country. Really wish there was some level of proportionality at work in terms of response. Fuck, even I'm a massive hypocrite for writing this.

If we found that it was even money, that 50% of ""trans kids"" would not be trans adults, would they stop advocating transition as a solution to gender dysphoria in children?  What if ""only"" 30% would grow up to be non-trans adults...would they think that having subjected those children to puberty blockers and social transition was an acceptable loss so that the other 70% could ""pass"" more convincingly as adults?

Gender_Critical,3c5yue,BetAle,4,Mon Jul 6 00:55:35 2015 UTC,"All these trans parents don't get the fact that so-called ""gender dysphoria"" is a symptom of a underlying mental issue, similar to how the symptoms of anorexia (seeing a dangerously thin body as being very fat) indicate an underlying mental issue.  We don't enable the symptoms of anorexia with liposuction surgery, or encourgagin weight loss, we treat the underlying mental issue to help the anorexic see their body in realistic terms.  So, why are they treating so-called ""trans kids"" by enabling the symptoms (transition), instead of addressing the underyling mental issue of seeing oneself as being one sex in the ""wrong"" body of the other and helping these kids to see their bodies in realistic terms?  Trans parents also ignore the fact that it takes at least 20 years of so for children to fully complete their cognitive development and, as children, are especially prone to magical thinking and are quite suggestible to the cues being given to them by the adults around them.   It is in recognition of the fact that cognitive development isn't completed until young adulthood that children are prohibited from a range of activities for their own protection: Children may not legally live independently, smoke, drink, consent to sex, get married, join the armed forces, be responsible for their debts, and so on.  Nor are parents legally permitted to allow their children engage in these activities contrary to the law.    So, why should this trans stuff be any different?  Children do not yet have sufficient cognitive development to give informed consent to any sort of transitioning.  To give puberty blockers and cross sex hormones that permanently remove a child's reproductive capacity before they are old enough to give informed consent is nothing short of a human rights violation, little different from the eugenics movement of 100 years ago that sterilized ""undesirables"" without their informed consent.  Why are parents no longer willing to be parents and tell their child, ""No, you're not really a boy because you hate dresses and love baseball - you're a tomboy"" or ""No, you're not really a girl just because you like dresses and nailpolish,  you just have a different personality"".

At three years old. Three.  Mom asks the kid ""how do you know you're a girl"" or similar and the kid says ""I just know"" and that a girl is someone who says she's a girl.  Mom then goes on to reminisce about how she and the kid would then talk about how some girls have vaginas, and some girls have penises, and her realizing to herself, well, if some girls can have penises, and girls can wear pants and be astronauts, what is being a girl anyway?  But she doesn't actually answer that (at least in this episode I heard) and so I really wonder if she's arrived at any answer.

I watched a bit of the video, where she criticizes a ""Dutch Study.""  The study, which can be found here, examined 77 children who were seen at a Dutch clinic.  When followed up at adulthood, 21 persisted, 33 desisted, and 23 either did not respond or could not be traced.  ""Gendermom"" postulates that these 23 children who did not respond went on to transition, imagining them going to another doctor who embraces them as transgender.  Perhaps in the US that might happen, but not in The Netherlands.  Wallien and Cohen-Kettenis write:   In the Netherlands, treatment is covered by insurance and easily available, but only in the Amsterdam clinic. It therefore seems unlikely that some nonresponders are, in fact, persisters, and that the observed persistence rate of 27% differs much from the actual persistence rate.   Just to hammer this point home, according to this article, ""the Amsterdam VU university medical center treats 98% of the Dutch transsexuals.""

We don't know what happens to GID kids given puberty blockers because it's a new treatment modality.    So I'll be curious what regret rate these guys do have.  It should be around 80%.  If it's less, you might say that's good, but I say it's not.  If it turns out only, say, 30% of those kids grow up to have no GID and stay their birth sex and gay, I'd say it looks like puberty blockers are mostly good at removing gay kids from the breeding population.

The article makes some good points about the general lack of facilities for women, but focuses on gender, not the issues women face - male violence, the sexualisation of their bodies, the physical realities of having a female reproductive system. Assuming gender is the problem and we just need to get over that just doesn't work for women.   The problems in India are well known, and I read an article recently that said they have communal toilets in the slums, but as always it's risky for women to use. They have to go in groups if they do use them, and many just  won't because it's too much risk for them. I've even heard that in the UK, a local swimming pool went for the unisex option, basically communal with cubicles and within a week or so two men got sprung trying to film women getting changed over the top of the cubicle. This sort of thing prevents women from safely using the pool and would mean many won't go there or will stop them going. The worst part is that sort thing is a predicable result, while she complains a women's toilet means predators know where the women are, it is ignored that men can be stopped from going in there. The communal option means that this simple protection is removed, and women using the toilet may be faced with men or groups of men who mean no good."

The restrooms near the beach do not have doors on the stalls, so you almost have to go with a friend to guard the door, or hold up a towel while you are in there- because guys would walkin to take a look hoping to see something-like a girl undressing. And some were known to keep close by so they can keep doing this to different young women until the police are called.  This cut down on sexual assault, because they could not stop men and boys from entering stalls where there is no life guard or park management on duty.   In some areas, gay men were cruising in beach areas and 'woman' on the door did not stop them from entering for a tryst when the men's room was occupied.

Gender_Critical,3bfki8,cones_hotline,6,Sun Jun 28 19:56:15 2015 UTC,"Here's an excerpt. It's pretty un-PC but interesting. The stuff about sexual imprinting seems to fit pretty well to what I remember from my childhood (dunno, really, I was sexually attracted to women since before puberty).   The evidence above makes clear that early socio-affective interactions (or object relations) with a mother are essential to the development and organization of psychic structure responsible for both self-regulation and adaptation. Also, the critical period for growth of these structures is heavily influenced by the interaction of mother and child. The cortex matures towards 18 months and this correlates with the observed irreversible determination of gender identity around that time. In normal development the parent’s reactions to the child are stored coupled with an affective activation through the limbic system. In AD the individual’s ability to integrate the parent’s responses to their behaviours and presentation is impaired. Therefore it is quite possible that their ‘‘working models of femaleness and maleness’’ may be impaired as well. Both sexes contain a feminine and masculine component of personality (Stoller, 1968). The ability of the child to differentiate itself depends intimately on its ability to identify with its parents and its parents reactions to it.   There is a very finely balanced reciprocal relation between environment and organism in differentiation of brain sex. Between the ages of two-and-a-half and four-and-a-half, sexual object choice is, by a combination of maturation and imprinting, fixed in the brain. In individuals with AD this object choice or sense of gender may be distorted or may be abnormal. Stoller (1986) encapsulates the dynamic theory of sexual identity. He describes how anxiety in the infant generates conflict between the infant’s urges and the need to comply with external forces. The conflict leads to regression to an earlier state of experience and this regression may be imprinted and subsequently sexualized. An example may help here. A young man presented to me at the request of his own psychiatrist for clarification of what they thought was a paraphilia. The man, 26 years old, was heterosexual and had been living with his girlfriend for two years. He was an infantilist requiring adult diapers when he went to bed. He said that wearing diapers made him feel safe and comfortable. He denied getting any sexual pleasure from this, saying ‘‘an erection isn’t very infantile, that wouldn’t work at all, I try and get rid of it!’’ Exploration of his history revealed that his mother had separated from his father when he was a few months old. She had taken up with an alcoholic man when the boy was three and the family had moved into the bush in the North. For two years the boy was exposed to violence towards his mother and the erratic behaviour of his alcoholic step-father. During this time, as suggested by Stoller, he dealt with the threat by regressing to an earlier stage, one in which he was still an infant. This regression was imprinted and remained strong and unchanged by the time that I saw him. It is important to note that while this image was fixed, it was not sexualized. Sexualization of a fantasy or a regression apparently takes place slightly later, between four-and-a-half and five-and-a-half years old. This is the result of the maturation in the limbic system and hypothalamus of the circuitry, which will govern sexual behaviours.  The abnormal processes noted above can alter the efficacy or the specifics of maturation. Observation of paraphilias in the adult shows that abnormal object choices are imprinted on the sexual circuitry very early. Individuals will state that they have memories from four or five years old of being attracted to particular objects or dynamics, which evolved into the sexualized foci later in their lives. The vulnerability to abnormal processes and imprinting may also be a sequellae of the early difficulties observed in AD."

She can get somewhere if people don't realize she's female. It's quirky and neat to have a ""boy name.""  It is not cool for a male baby to have what might possibly be considered a ""girl name"" - just refer to the song ""Boy named Sue.""  This is why, overwhelmingly, ""boy names"" migrate to become ""possibly acceptable to give to girls"" and then to ""known androgynous"" and then finally to ""girl names"" never to be given to young boy babies again.  See: Shannon, Leslie, Ashley, Stacy.  See also: Taylor, Jordan.  When do you ever see a name migrate from ""feminine"" to ""androgynous"" to ""mostly given to male babies""?  You don't.

That being said, I do see some political use for her more mild tone. Most people dismiss our arguments because T is allied with LGB and we are ""too mean.""

Gender_Critical,3b7yhd,AliceTheGorgon,6,Fri Jun 26 19:18:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is one of my problems with transactivism around prisons, jails, detention centers etc.   If there is any legitimate ""men's rights"" crisis today I think it's our justice system and the so-called prison industrial complex that oppresses men of color, black men specifically.   I support any oppressed group centering their own in their activism (which is why I think Gutierrez doing so is okay), but ultimately, it's men's correctional facilities that need to be reformed so that all inmates are protected from abuse, Ts and regular men alike.   Instead of working to fix the problem, which is our broken justice system, Ts wish to make the already broken system worse for women! and the most vulnerable women at that.  So while I think this issue is important, it should always be framed in the context of the larger issue which is the human rights of all undocumented immigrants being held by ICE."
Gender_Critical,3b7yhd,transbasenji,3,Sat Jun 27 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"Undocumented immigrants in ICE custody are oppressed on multiple levels: race, lack of citizenship, poverty, unstable political/economic conditions back home (aftermath of US foreign policy in Latin America during the Cold War), etc. so detained transwomen are oppressed but as moc, and more so for being GNC moc being held in a notoriously sexually abusive environment.   Like I said in the other post about this, I support this person's activism on behalf of this undoubtably oppressed group of which he is a member. And Obama brought up TWOC in his speech so I think this was actually the perfect opportunity for Gutierrez to address the issue.   This isn't a man complaining about lesbian feminists not inviting him to a party. This is a man rightfully fighting for oppressed transwomen who are in real danger of violence and from the state no less. He didn't write an op ed in HuffPo blaming women for the violence disadvantaged transwomen face. He took his concerns to the president, a man who has the power to do something about it.  Now it looks like he's asking for asylum for LGBT(especially) undocumented immigrants. I could support GNC detainees getting asylum, depending on how it works.   I know there's a limit on visas Homeland Security gives out. Is there a number that go to women and a number that go to men?   Women are specifically oppressed in many Latin American countries, especially when compared to males:  Many Latin American countries have alarmingly high rates of femicide.   According to the Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on violence against women, the rate at which women are being killed in several Central American countries is alarming when compared to the rate that Latin men are being killed. The majority of the female victims are from socioeconomically disadvantaged and vulnerable backgrounds   Abortion is illegal in many Latin American countries.  Here are maps from TDOR showing number of trans homicides by country: 2013, 2014.  As long as no women lose out on asylum to GNC/GBT males, I don't have a problem with granting Ts special oppressed male status for the purpose of seeking it. If it takes away from women who need asylum just as much, if not more, than GNC men then I don't support it.  I would be okay with transactivists if they demanded to be first in line for males but no they always want to be first in line for females. It's the difference between transactivism that hurts and oppresses women and transactivism that can coexist with feminism."

About 30 per cent of all women experience some form of intimate partner violence (IPV) during their lifetime (Devries et al, 2013). In surveys women who suffered IPV report significantly poorer health when compared to non-abused women. The have difficulty walking, struggle with daily activities, suffer from pain, memory loss, dizziness and vaginal discharge. They also report significantly higher levels of emotional distress, suicidal thoughts and suicidal attempts (Ellsberg et al 2008). Based on country studies the WHO (2013) also concludes that women who suffer IPV are 16 per cent more likely to have a low birth weight baby and in some regions they are 1.5 times more likely to acquire HIV and 1.6 times more likely to have syphilis when compared to women who do not suffer partner violence. In addition there are long term consequences for the next generation that witnessed the violence. Daughters are more likely to be abused by their partners and their sons are more likely to become abusers themselves (Hindin et al, 2008; WDR 2012: 152).   Utterly depressing numbers in the full report."

I had assumed everything would be the same except more urinals, fewer stalls, and maybe blue decorations instead of pink ones.  In the pools where I currently swim, on the other hand, the facilities are practically identical aside from the practical differences mentioned by OP."

Also the men's was bare and utilitarian, while the women's had flowers and little decorations everywhere.    I do understand that some people prefer privacy while showering and changing (although I can't imagine all of those people are female), and also have nothing against flowers, but the differences were shocking.

A trans woman who has not had SRS probably cares more about feeling safe in a place like a bathroom than being able to stand up and pee. Bathroom labels are meant to be convenient but you can't deny that a trans woman going into a men's bathroom will get strange looks/comments. If they were labeled by body parts instead of gender this might be easier for them. It probably sounds super weird for a bathroom to be labeled this way and I admit I can't come up with a perfect way to phrase it but I think this is the most accurate way to label bathrooms."

You only have to look at reactions to men doing ""feminine"" things, or how many qualifiers men have to use in order to do what are considered ""feminine"" things (guyliner, manpurse, manscaping etc.)  Being like a woman is the worst thing a man can be, because woman-things are considered frivolous and inferior and men and men-things are superior by default.

As voi_che_sapete hinted at, what is considered ""masculinity"" and ""femininity"" are not  static things.  They're dynamic and they almost always suit whatever benefits males.  Here's a good, simple way to look at it: gardening vs. farming.  Most people would view gardening as a feminine activity, whereas farming is quite masculine.  But what's the difference besides scale?  Both words mean growing plants, but farming feeds entire communities whereas gardening is more something people do for fun.  Notice how the more important task is the one considered appropriate for men?  You can find countless examples of this sort of thing.  As for this part of your question:   how can you respect people who are feminine?   By not coding personality traits as ""masculine"" or ""feminine.""  Some people get so wrapped up in their gender identity that there's no way we can respect them because we don't respect gender to begin with.

How about that women are expected to be the cooks in a domestic setting but once you have cooking in a professional setting, whoa there, better let the men take over.   Kind of like how typing was considered a strictly female occupation until the ability to type on a computer became extremely important to professional settings and day-to-day life, and then, suddenly, it was worthy of the attention of men.

Men align themselves with power. Power expresses itself in ways relative to the culture they're in.   For instance, in the past, men were the ones capable of great feeling, when passion was valued. Women's feelings were superficial and trivial, and at best they were seen as possessing of a staunch pragmatism to men's deep aspirations.   Meanwhile, in our current era, men are often taught that being stoic is powerful. Weakness is vulnerability. Women are allowed to indulge their perfectly natural feelings. This is tricky because being stoic all the time is not healthy and natural for most men -- so in a way, it's an advantage that women get to express themselves more, but it is still seen as the weaker attribute to be expressive, and men still get the benefit of power and status when they are stoic.  So even if a feminine trait is perfectly human and natural, it can be placed on the ""weaker"" end of the scales and be demonized as feminine -- and work in the larger dynamic toward women's oppression."
Gender_Critical,3b0zmq,voi_che_sapete,2,Thu Jun 25 03:32:37 2015 UTC,"For instance, in the past, men were the ones capable of great feeling, when passion was valued. Women's feelings were superficial and trivial, and at best they were seen as possessing of a staunch pragmatism to men's deep aspirations.   Maybe class plays a role in this too, considering that in the past only the upper class learned to write. For example, perhaps upper class men are allowed to have heroic, aspiring feelings: if you have heroic passions and can bring them to reality, congratulations, you're an upper class heroic Real Man. Meanwhile lower class men are supposed to silently/stoically do their duty. (Maybe the specific occupational roles of men and women too?)   so in a way, it's an advantage that women get to express themselves more, but it is still seen as the weaker attribute to be expressive, and men still get the benefit of power and status when they are stoic.   But it's also considered acceptable for women to be weak, whereas men aren't allowed to be weak. Let's not forget that."

Gender_Critical,3axaea,Jonahmix,18,Wed Jun 24 06:23:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, this reminds me of something I've been thinking. Female gender performance includes: always putting yourself  last; watching as men steal your ideas; getting used to deferring to men on everything; making all the teas and coffees; staying silent for fear of seeming strident or bitchy; laughing at the jokes and not making them; picking up after people; not receiving the praise due to you; working twice as hard to be considered half as good; not being heard when you speak in a group; having your intelligence underestimated; endlessly finding your physical appearance wanting; subject to continual gendered double standards. So, so many more. Gender is very unfair to women, it sucks.   However, male trans seem to ""feel like a woman"" in a very surface way. The use gender in a way that pleases them sexually, and leave out the very, very many shit parts. They are not quiet and accommodating. They aren't afraid of looking strident. They put themselves first. If you read the stories of women whose husbands are trans, they don't help out any more around the house than they did before. I think it was naeferty who said her husband helped less after he transitioned. Gendered femininity most certainly does not condition women to feel entitled to sex, as it does trans.  The femininity that trans perform is very much that of outsiders looking in.Worse, it's the performance of the privileged class looking in. Women, they seem to think, are gorgeous and adored and pampered. Women are the centre of attention all the time. This, as any woman knows, is the opposite of the truth. And it really speaks to the fact that the gender they are feeling has no basis in the gendered reality of women, but that of men looking on as the privileged class. The specific performance of femininity that trans engage in, as much as logic, science or common sense, speaks to what a load of (literal) bollocks it is."
Gender_Critical,3axaea,mrsgetlost,9,Wed Jun 24 08:12:21 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right. It's about what men think women are, not what women actually are in reality.

Why do they not feel they need to take care of dependants for no pay? Where are the ones who fantasize about working 50 hours as a server in a bar, coming home to do more work cooking and cleaning while the husband watches TV? Unpaid domestic labor is far more what ""womanhood"" usually is, not ""sexy fun.""  Even biologically, some may fantasize about pregnancy or mensuration (this really irritates me, pregnancy is one of the more dangerous things a woman does in her life, males SHOULD NOT fantasize or appropriate it). Where are the ones who fantasize about going through menopause? Bruce should be postmenopausal if he's a woman."

I don't know very many trans people IRL so I can't speak to their motivations in expressing gender in the way they do but I think that it is quite possible for them to be making a conscious choice to express gender this way rather than it being some sort of innate compulsion. If that is the case,  it only makes sense that they would take the things they like from a gender expression and dump the things that are shitty...it's rational self interest. As a matter of fact this very process, I think, is important in dismantling traditional gender roles, although I can see that it may also create new ones or disenfranchise those who already inhabit those roles.   Taking charge of one's gender expression ought to be encouraged across the board but doing so with honesty and consideration for others is also important. Should Kate Bornstein be included on a list of radical women? Well... you can't get any more radical than including someone who isn't a woman, right?

Gender_Critical,3axaea,BrotherNemesis,10,Wed Jun 24 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"Your reply completely fails to account for power. It also fails to recognise that gender is an organising hierarchy designed to perpetuate the oppression of women by men. You need privilege to begin with to decide you can subvert gender roles. Women can't identify their way out of oppression, but men can identify their way into an ersatz version of it whilst, as you say ""dumping the things that are shitty"". Men playing around with gender roles does zip to free women from patriarchy. And suggesting gender is innate in fact entrenches women's subordination, as nearly every post on this sub demonstrates."

It also fails to recognise that gender is an organising hierarchy designed to perpetuate the oppression of women by men. You need privilege to begin with to decide you can subvert gender roles.   I can't say that you are wrong in your assessment of the hierarchy erected by  gender roles. These roles obviously benefit men at the expense of women in many instances. But your equation of privilege with choice bothers me. After all, every feminist I've known has subverted gender norms and has chosen to do so despite not being privileged. I can recognize that the choice to break gender roles is easier for a man because he has been socialized from an early age to value himself more highly than others but he can still act as an example, on a human level, of how to break gender expectations. So in a sense, while his contribution to breaking down gender roles may not be a relevant as a woman's doing something similar I think it can still be helpful. I will agree though that many trans-peoples insistence that gender is innate does somewhat hamper their ability to inspire gender non-conformity."

Of course I have to admit that this challenge is only made in so far as people are aware that the person they are seeing is a male (or female) acting out the opposing role."
Gender_Critical,3axaea,BrotherNemesis,11,Wed Jun 24 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"Except it isn't challenged, because that person with a penis is saying conforming to those patriarchal gender roles makes him a woman.

And further these men tell actual women who have had to navigate society as females their whole lives and fight against these very same stereotypes that if they fail to recognize these men as women they're hateful and ignorant. These men and their ""womanness"" can never be questioned, because even though they claim they're exactly the same as women they still expect to exert authority over them.  How is that helpful to feminism?"

If we look at the candidness of high profile people like Chaz Bono or Conchita Wurst we can see stories that help to break down sharply defined gender roles in the minds of the public. It is also helpful to remember the act of transitioning is not a feminist act in and of itself. It is the sharing  of their motivations, their desire to express themselves in a different way in spite of societal pressures to the contrary that can be feminist.   These men and their ""womanness"" can never be questioned, because even though they claim they're exactly the same as women they still expect to exert authority over them.   Sex and gender both  ought be questioned, and not just of trans-people. Discussing the ins and outs of biology and culture with regards to these issues is paramount in discovering and disseminating important truths relevant to all humanity. However, questioning someone with the goal to shame them is different than questioning them to bring to light a biological fact. To some extent the intent of the questioner matters and then also the maturity of the person being questioned. There are useful discussions to have on this matter, its just a little off-putting that mainstream feminism seems so reluctant to engage in them."

My point is that there is some such brain function that we colloquially identify as ""consciousness"", and then a process which is a subset of that function which we identify as ""choice"". Through the process of ""choice"" our brains are able to change their own structure with regards to things like memory, awareness, sensation, kinesthesia. But there are some aspects of the brain,  such as the subconscious, respiratory control, and possibly some aspects of identity which choice cannot directly change. In other words, it is unclear(to me) whether every aspect of identity is or is not a function of choice. All of it is neurological you're right, but my question is whether feeling, or identifying as a ""woman"" is necessarily choice dependent."

Gender_Critical,3anw1d,mrsgetlost,10,Tue Jun 23 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"Your comments violated a number a number of rules actually. That not only included transphobia or ""gender critical content"" or whatever you want to call it, but it also included weird biotruths, victim blaming, sexism and mocking other cultures. And those are just the ones that mods noted.   Ok then; for everyone's amusement, here are all my posts on that sub, all written in one evening (I was procrastinating, and wandered over to FemmeThoughts.)   Jails are different. I work in a men's jail and you've got a large number of sexually-deprived males all milling about. It isn't fair to them for a young woman to come into their living areas dressed in clothing that is the slightest bit revealing. We have had to send volunteers home for being dressed too sexy, though what they wore would have been fine in a business office. I recall a guy in the cage greeting me with, ""Hi, how are YOU today?"" and then turning to the other inmates and saying, ""Oh Man! I need sex for, like, medical reasons."" (I was wearing khaki pants, a high-collared blouse and a white lab coat, my hair tied back and glasses. Perhaps it was a sexy librarian look...)   True story. I can see how this post would be contentious from a feminist perspective, but an all-male correctional facility is a unique setting where the usual rules of power and male privilege don't apply. I maintain that it's not fair to male inmates for women to come into their living areas in revealing clothing.  All women are there voluntarily, while the inmates are not.   They thought that was too flagrant and sexy?? What are they, Amish?   I offended the Amish people of reddit.   Sounds like there was perhaps some sort of personal issue you triggered by virtue of your attractive appearance and she wanted to get rid of you as quickly as possible, professional behaviour be damned.   Is that the ""victim-blaming?""   I hate family businesses. They pay the family members better, they blame you over family if something goes pear-shaped, and they'll fire you if an idiot cousin needs a job.   I guess I offended the idiot cousins.   One of my coworkers transitioned in 2008 and is now a transwoman. My workplace is NOT politically correct, and there were a lot of people expressing doubts. I confronted some of the doubters, saying that if this is what this person feels they need to do, it's not our business to critique or second-guess what is an intensely personal decision. I am personally a feminist who feels that gender is a heirarchical social construct that oppresses women and gender nonconforming men. But I don't get into it in the workplace. You make a good point about how people go on about such topics, they don't know who is listening. Though I don't know what being bi has to do with trans. Sexuality and gender identity are non-overlapping magisteria.   I was honest about being gender critical. But I recommended supporting a trans coworker. And sexuality and gender identity are non-overlapping magisteria. And gender is a hierarchical social construct, but it doesn't hate on anybody to say so.  That seems to be all of them. If I offended anybody here, have at me."

Gender_Critical,3anw1d,BrackenGold,12,Tue Jun 23 00:10:20 2015 UTC,"The more I think on it, they basically had it in for me because I am gender critical. I mean, if you look at my posts, either these are the most thin-skinned people on the interwebs, or it's totally trumped-up.  What they said initially was, ""Terfs aren't welcome here."" And then I was banned. When I asked for an explanation, they said they made themselves clear the first time, and came up with the whole rationale above when I made some noise.   Their first explanation was the most honest."

Gender_Critical,3anw1d,mrsgetlost,-13,Tue Jun 23 03:12:31 2015 UTC,"Your first post is what got us to check your posting habits. And yes, we do take into account other reddit behaviour. Had you not had a bad posting history, we would have removed the comment, and asked you to clarify your statement. Because there's a difference between believing gender is a construct, and believing that trans women are really men and so on and so forth.  But because we could see your posting history and so on, we didn't need to ask for clarification.   Lots of times we'll get borderline statements that can be read a number of different ways. If the person doesn't have a negative history, we'll ask for clarification and make our subreddit rules clear. But if they do, then there's no point in going through that extra step. Same way that when a statement is borderline and we're not sure if it's bad wording, thoughtlessness or something else, and we see that the user participates in mensrights or whiterights...we don't bother to ask for clarification and explain the rules.  If you come into the community and participate, then we expect that you have read our rules and respect them. Screw-ups are okay, everyone makes them. But when you're participating in a group based on misogyny or racism or transphobia and coming and then also participating in a group that has no tolerance for bigotry...you do not get a long leash, you get cut off at the pass."
Gender_Critical,3anw1d,generibus,15,Tue Jun 23 06:26:44 2015 UTC,"This person DID respect your rules, ON YOUR SUB.  Do you honestly expect they'll follow those rules everywhere they go?

Gender_Critical,3anw1d,AliceTheGorgon,-5,Tue Jun 23 17:09:13 2015 UTC,"No, actually, they didn't. They're first comment mentioned their gender critical views, and their later comments also had a variety of rule violations. But let's put that aside.  No, we don't expect our users to follow our rules everywhere that they go, that would be ridiculous. But we do not want members of our community who participate in hate groups, or hold incredibly hateful points of view.  We've had this same problem with people from whiterights and mensrights and so on. We could allow them to comment and only remove problem comments...but we do not want them in our community, period.  We have a very diverse community, and part of our job is to protect the community by not allowing everyone in. Reddit is majority white, male, cis, straight, and arsehole - and if we let everyone who came stay, we would be just like the rest of reddit.   You're right, it's totally possible that you could participate in our sub, follow our rules, never mention certain things and just keep hating people outside of that bubble. But FT isn't on a separate website, we're on reddit. Which means that we all bump into each other in other subs, and see other things that we've said.   This isn't about wanting to spy on people and make sure that they're ""good enough"" - this is about mitigating harm. We're a small sub, and users get to know each other. What would you think if you had regular users here who were then also participating in MR and bashing women? Or if you had regulars here who were then also participating in one of the anti-TERF subs?  If you participate in FT, you are going to be in a community that includes people of all colours and genders and sexual orientations and ability. And they are going to see you as a part of that community. So if they bump into someone from FT elsewhere on reddit and find that they regularly take part in bashing blacks or lesbians or trans people -- that's a huge violation.   If we were an utterly separate community on our own platform, this would not be an issue. But we're not, we're on reddit. And while you may be able to compartmentalise so that you can participate in places that are at odds, we're not going to force the rest of our members to.  We don't expect everyone to follow our rules everywhere in their lives, or even everywhere on reddit. But we're also not a fully open community. And one of the things we're not open to is bigotry - of any kind. If you actively participate in a hate group on reddit, then we do not want you in our group."

Their first comment wasn't on the thread about appropriate dress, but on a thread about trans people in the workplace. The jail comment was their last comment, not the first.  I don't know how you make the ridiculous leap from removing a comment where someone describes their job to assuming that we're all rich. That's about as far from reality as possible. It also makes no fucking sense.  We don't remove comments that involve someone describing their work because we dislike work or don't understand it. But if a comment where someone describes their work violates one of rules....yeah, we remove it (though this doesn't happen terribly often). The three most common rule violations that make us remove a comment that mentions their work are misogyny or victim-blaming, racism and derailing or invalidation. Some people are unable to talk about customers or co-workers without being bigoted as fuck. And some people respond to discussions with fairly off-topic or invalidating stories about their work...which is just inappropriate. Generally this is in response to someone else struggling with something professionally, and invalidating or derailing - those are just arsehole moves."

The comment about prisons was not the one that got us to check their history or ban them. Their first comment (on a post about trans people in the workplace) was the one. We then removed all their comments and banned them.    Your assumption of our privilege is ridiculous. It's not only a conclusion that's wildly off the mark, but the leap you took to get there made no sense. We have no issue with comments where people describe their work. But if a comment about work also violates one of our rules, we remove it, just like we would any other problem comment. This doesn't happen often, but the three most common rule violations that cause these removals are 1 - misogyny and/or victim-blaming, 2 - racism, 3 - derailing and/or invalidation."

I didn't post anything with a whiff of gender critical content   That's a flat out lie. You didn't just comment in that one thread on office attire, and your first comment included ""gender critical content"".    And I didn't violate the rules of the sub but I was insta-banned.   Those are not our only rules...those are a very few ones listed on the sidebar, which repeatedly tells you to read our full rules page.  Your comments violated a number a number of rules actually. That not only included transphobia or ""gender critical content"" or whatever you want to call it, but it also included weird biotruths, victim blaming, sexism and mocking other cultures. And those are just the ones that mods noted.  And if you'd actually read our rules pages, you'll note that we make it very clear that we reserve the right to ban anyone at any time, regardless of rule violations.   Do people who post on Gender Critical get onto a list somewhere? (That was a rhetorical question; I already know the answer.)   No, there's no official list, at least not one that I'm aware of. Lots of redditors run bots and pull immense amounts of data and compile lists of all sorts of users, but I'm not aware of any such list.  We catch most of the GC users because a) we have a very well programmed bot that flags on various words and phrases to make sure a mod checks them. b) mods tend to be active and we try and read every thread. If the bot doesn't get you, a mod will notice it. c) we do keep a tighter eye on hate subs and subs that have a tendency to brigade us. GC falls under both of these groups.    To the rest of you, no, /r/FemmeThoughts isn't run by men. The insistence that we are is getting a little ridiculous. It's getting so annoying that we've actually jokingly debated in modmail sending you lovely people hairy crotch shots to prove it. We do have one man on the mod team, and he does good work.  Also, this is the third or fourth time I've seen users in here complain about being banned who have never been banned. If you don't have a ban, and want one, there's no need to lie about it. Just ask us for a ban, we tend to be fairly accommodating in banning users who request it.    EDIT: I'm aware that I didn't reply to all your points and questions. I did intend to, but the heavy downvoting has made continuing to reply technically difficult. I'm sending the mods a modmail informing them of this, and asking if they'll give me approved submitter status so I could continue responding to questions and complaints regarding our moderation.   It's up to them. However regardless of technical fixes, I will however no longer reply to anyone who threatens me or the rest of the moderation team with violence. And if users continue to threaten us, I will stop altogether. I'm happy to explain things and answer questions - even for people who really hate me. But it needs to be a) technically possible and b) not dangerous."

I'm assuming most mods were using it as a descriptor, but I haven't seen that many of the mods naked so.... The hairy part has absolutely nothing to do with you.    C2) WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU for JOKING about sexually harassing people? Jesus Christ, you guys are up on a high horse for banning our members for referring to people as male and female while you joke about sexually harassing us. You guys are some sick douchebags.   Joking that the only way you'd believe we were women was if we showed you our genitals is not joking about sexually harassing you. It's joking about your ""gender critical"" viewpoints.   Pretend there are two guys talking. One of these guys is thought to be a woman online, and no amount of him telling people otherwise is working. He says ""I swear, these people would only believe I was a guy if I sent them a dick pic"". That's not sexual harassment or even joking about sexual harassment. Now, if you change the context, and he's joking about the looks on peoples faces if he sent them a dick pic - that's joking about sexual harassment.  Neither scenario actually is sexual harassment, because all he's doing is talking privately. But one scenario is joking about sexual harassment, one is not. Seriously, you people need to learn contexts.   C3) Isn't that transphobic of you to assume that sending us a pic of your hairy vulva would constitute you all being women? What about FTMs?   Or we could all be post-op MTF and able to send the pics. The joke is about your perceptions of gender, not about what actually constitutes gender.   Though I don't know why I'm bothering to explain...context really isn't your thing."

The Amish pride themselves and are known for their conservative dress codes. It’s not a negative though. It’s only a negative thing if you think dressing that way is bad or “prudish”   Racism? No, but no one mentioned racism.   The way YOU phrased it as if criticising another aspect of white culture is bad. Culture is part of a racial dynamic.   Do some SRS subs brigade? Yes, they do. I'm not sure what that has to do with me....unless I'm being blamed for the behaviour of every member of every sub I've ever participated in, and that's a strange rabbit hole to go down. That's even more childish than ""I'm rubber you're glue.""   You accuse us of brigading even though we’re a tiny sub and have never been known or have ever perpetuated a brigade on any other sub.  You are the one to accuse us even though you participate in subs that are known for that conduct. Furthermore, you came into OUR sub to attack us with another one of your mods. So it’s not exactly a reach.   Joking about proving our gender isn't sexual harassment.    EXCUSE ME? Oh, yeah. Like all the dudebros who threaten to post pictures of women on the internet can just say “I was only joking”.   The threat is there and YOU MADE THE THREAT. Turning around now that I’ve identified you as SEXUALLY HARASSING OUR USER BASE and saying “Oh, it was only a joke” doesn’t fucking fly with anyone.  Saying “It was a joke” is a bullshit excuse perpetuated by harasses. It smacks of the whole “lighten up you crotchety bitches” that men perpetuate.   Actually sending unsolicited images would be, but joking isn't. We didn't threaten to send you images either.    “It was only joking when I said I’d said I’d sent you naked pictures” – Really?  How is that even an excuse? You said you would send them to prove to us…what? We didn’t ask for them which makes them unsolicited naked images of other people. It’s exactly the same as saying “I’m going to send you a picture of my dick” and then turning around and going “I was only joking” because of the backlash.  That is harassment. No one asked you or any of your mods for naked pictures but you think it’s FUNNY to send that to people anyone.   You also didn’t address my points. Do you think if any of us were under the age of 18 and took issue with you sending us naked images that you could argue that “I was only joking about sending them”.  I’m also infuriated that you think doing so is not only “okay” but also “funny”.  It's disgusting.   And yes, it is weird to show someone your genitals to prove your gender to them, but you're the people who insist on that, not us. That's the joke. That you care so much about genitals that that's the only way you'd ever believe we were women.   Uh no. Hello strawman argument.  Not a single user here (or anywhere I have seen) has ever asked anyone for a naked photo to prove their sex. That’s a bullshit lie perpetuated by people who take issue with our analysis and determination of how biological sex is classified.  We’ve never asked for “panty” checks or anything of the sort. That is a lie used to smear feminists here. The fact that you call yourself a feminist and perpetuate these salacious lies is disgusting.  Furthermore, you make a mockery of the concerns we AS WOMEN discuss about the rate of sexual assault that occurs from males being allowed into female space by dumbing it down to “panty checks”.  You obviously don’t know or don’t care about the restrictions of female autonomy that occurs by forcing them to share spaces with male bodied people. Trans”women” are male. Humans cannot change their sex.   Not that you care, but it's behaviour like this that is why participants of this sub and other hate subs get a much, much, much shorter leash in FT and are sometimes even banned outright.    The behaviour that you yourself invented as no one here has ever asked a user to PROVE their sex to us, and certainly never by the means of showing genitals.   That is a made up lie perpetuated by the transgender movement against us.  The fact that you think it’s funny to flash people (show genitals without a person’s consent) because of a lie made up by males to ridicule us is revolting.   Most of the time, when we have to remove comments and give warnings, users react well. At the worst, the go complain about us somewhere else on reddit.    That is what the user did. They complained here which is another space on Reddit. Somehow you now take issue with this? You just said it was fine.   But people from GC and other hate subs have a tendency to react much, much worse. They tend to fill up our modmail screaming at us for starters. Sometimes they personally stalk the mods. They tell ridiculous and wild stories and go out of their way to inflame mobs.   No. I’ve been a member of all the GC related subs for over half their lives and have never seen even in old postings or modmails that this has ever occurred. You are quite literally making shit up at this point.  If you have proof, I’m sure you can provide the screencaps. I know as a mod that I screencap aggressive users so surely if you have witnessed it you can now prove it.   You're concerned about threatening and harassment, but you're the only person who's engage in either of those behaviours. I told you that we'd joked, and your response was to threaten to go to the biggest internet mob and claim that we'd threatened you with sexual harassment.   You threatened to send us naked images and are now saying “it’s a joke”.  It’s a bullshit tactic that people utilise when they are caught out. I absolutely should tell them about this because I think it’s a disgusting, hypocritical thing for you to do. You say that you are above the sexist tactics of harassing women on the internet for existing and then sexually harass women on the internet for having a contrary opinion.   Then you say “I was only joking about it” as if that absolves you of any responsibility.  If you didn’t want to be caught out for harassing people, you don’t harass people. You don’t victim blame and put the same bullshit, anti-victim tactics onto the person that has complained. You are telling me that I “can’t take a joke”.   I don’t think it’s a joke when you threaten to send naked images of your abhorrent selves unsolicited and then play the “lighten up” card. You are exactly the same as some dickhead in a workplace telling a woman to “lighten up” and stop being so uptight when they object to sexist behaviour.   We've gone back and forth about our policy in regards to hate subs, and always, 100% of the time, I'm the one who's argued for leniency.   This has got nothing to do with me. I’m not the OP. I don’t care what you do with your subs.  I am responding to your “JOKE” that you would send women here naked images unsolicited because it’s “FUNNY”.   But then you constantly go and behave in this way, and there's a reason I lose that argument.   You literally sound like an abusive partner right now. Your argument boils down to “If you didn’t burn dinner, I wouldn’t have to hit you”. You are blaming me for taking issue with your harassment.   For any GC members who don't like the harsh line we take for just participating here -- look around, this is why. We don't really have any other options.   Which is “If you women don’t play by our rules, we are going to send you naked pictures because it’s funny to do that”  You are isolating women based on their ideology. You are saying that if women don’t agree or conform to the way you think the world should work that they shouldn’t be allowed to ever express themselves. You are like a conservative telling a lesbian she can’t be a school teachers because they disagree with our sexuality and our expression.  You are policing and demonising women because they don’t agree with you.  But let me guess, it’s a joke right?"

I have no idea who organised it or where they did. But we have been brigaded by GC people more than once -lots of new accounts commenting, all linking to this and other GC subs or linking to one of your main sidebar resources, repeating the same canned lines.   And I didn't come here to attack you. I came in direct response to a specific complaint that was wildly inaccurate - for the purposes of correcting that. And I've stayed to answer questions and correct other misstatements. I have not attacked anyone, though I've been attacked myself. Ironically, even KIA behaved better when I answered their questions about the moderation of another one of my subs. They a) downvoted me less, b) the mods gave me approved submitter status so I could continue responding to questions even when my vote totals were low, c) they did not threaten me and d) they twisted my words much less.    The threat is there and YOU MADE THE THREAT. Turning around now that I’ve identified you as SEXUALLY HARASSING OUR USER BASE and saying “Oh, it was only a joke” doesn’t fucking fly with anyone.  “It was only joking when I said I’d said I’d sent you naked pictures” – Really?

I’m also infuriated that you think doing so is not only “okay” but also “funny”.    We never threatened to send pictures.    We never discussed or even thought about actually sending pictures. Because we never thought about sending pictures, we didn't bother to imagine your reactions or defending our actions afterwards. We didn't think about whether you'd react positively or negatively or if you were underage or legal trouble....BECAUSE WE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT SENDING PICTURES.  We don't think that sending unsolicited naked photography is ""okay"" or ""funny"". We think it's sexual harassment.  Nor do we think that threatening to send images without consent is ""okay"" or ""funny"". We think it's sexual harassment. We did think that saying ""the only way they'd believe we were women is if we showed them pictures of our hairy cooches"" was mildly funny. The joke wasn't one about sexual harassment, it was a joke about your views on gender and sex.    But since you seem to have trouble understanding this, let me try explaining.  Let's use an analogy. Two people are talking. One of them (a man) is perceived online as a woman, and no one believes that he's a man. He tells a friend ""honestly, I think the only way that they'd believe I was a man was if I sent dick pics."" That's not a threat to send pics, nor is it joking about sexual harassment. Now, in a different context - say imagining sending dick pics and how women would react - then that would be joking about sexual harassment. It wouldn't be a threat, but the ""joke"" would be the reaction of women when sent unsolicited dick pics and how he could provoke/unnerve/mess with them. That's a joke about sexual harassment, and IMO pretty sick and unfunny.  Or let's use your analogy of men posting pictures of women. A heterosexual couple who has kids is talking. They're going to spend some time at her family's house, and her parents are going to put them in separate rooms. He bemoans that the only way her parents would believe that she wasn't virginal was if he uploaded some videos/pictures and they saw for themselves. Is this a threat? No. Is it joking about sexual harassment? No. The joke is that her parents are in such denial about sex when it comes to their daughter that the only thing that could get through to them is seeing her in the act. Now if you change the context, a man ""joking"" about uploading pictures of his partner may well be joking about harassment or in fact, actually threatening her.   Context matters. The reason most rape jokes aren't funny isn't that they use the word ""rape"" or the concept of forced sex. It's that the butt of the joke is the person who was raped (or women in general, or something else gross). Rape jokes that mock the rapist, or the idea of rape, or rape culture...that's totally different (also rare). Using the word or concept itself is not the issue - the issue is what you say with it. In this case, not every comment that discusses showing naked pictures is a threat, or a joke about sexual harassment. Context matters.   The butt of the joke here is your beliefs - nothing else. The joke is that your obsession with genitals means that that's the only way you'd believe us with regards to gender. We find your approach towards genitals and gender and sex amusing. We exaggerated that mildly and tied it into not believing us about our gender. It's a joke - not terrifically funny, but it ties together related concepts and exaggerates in order to make a humorous point about your beliefs.   Not a single user here (or anywhere I have seen) has ever asked anyone for a naked photo to prove their sex. That’s a bullshit lie perpetuated by people who take issue with our analysis and determination of how biological sex is classified.  We’ve never asked for “panty” checks or anything of the sort. That is a lie used to smear feminists here. The fact that you call yourself a feminist and perpetuate these salacious lies is disgusting.   I never said that you asked for naked photos or did panty checks. Not once. See the last paragraph about the structure of the joke and humorous exaggeration to make a point. It is not literal in any way. It's not an accusation that you ask for panty checks or nude photos. It's not a threat or plan to send nude images ourselves. It's making fun of your opinions, and your concepts of gender and sex.   By the way, as far as I'm aware, all the ""salacious lies"" about panty checks and so on....aren't actually lies, they're jokes. People aren't spreading lies that you do panty checks or ask for photos...people are making a joke about your approach to gender and sex and how you would or could enforce it.    Furthermore, you make a mockery of the concerns we AS WOMEN discuss about the rate of sexual assault that occurs from males being allowed into female space by dumbing it down to “panty checks”.  You obviously don’t know or don’t care about the restrictions of female autonomy that occurs by forcing them to share spaces with male bodied people. Trans”women” are male. Humans cannot change their sex.   If by ""males"" you mean ""trans women"" ... then yes, your concerns are ridiculous. Not only does trans women != male bodied, but trans women being allowed into all women spaces doesn't increase the rate of sexual assault, and your attempts to smear trans women as rapists are gross.   The behaviour that you yourself invented as no one here has ever asked a user to PROVE their sex to us, and certainly never by the means of showing genitals.    The behaviour I was referring to was threatening to sic a dangerous and misogynistic mob on us.   I absolutely should tell them about this because I think it’s a disgusting, hypocritical thing for you to do.  If you didn’t want to be caught out for harassing people, you don’t harass people. You don’t victim blame and put the same bullshit, anti-victim tactics onto the person that has complained. You are telling me that I “can’t take a joke”.    We've already been over the fact that no one ever threatened you, but even we had, how does this make sense? Threatening to get the most misogynistic hate group online to come after us...what do you accomplish?  If you do this, there are a few possible outcomes. They turn around and laugh at or harass you. They ignore you. They do what you want and come after us. If you get lucky and the latter actually happens, then the result will be that you've sent a misogynistic hate group after a bunch of women. They will harass us (likely methods include sending porn and gore photos). They'll try and find nude photos of us (possibly by hacking) and put them in wide circulation. If they can't find anything, they'll photoshop it. We will receive threats. They will try to doxx us. If they do manage to doxx us, we'll be deluged with in-person harassment, stalking and violence, possibly even swatting.  And if they do, you will be responsible. Not just morally, and in the public view (try convincing mainstream feminists that you're really trying to help women by sending gamergate after a group of women for making a bad joke), but you will be legally responsible as well.   Pretend you're right and I did threaten you. Pretend I'm the disgusting hypocrite that you think I am. Why is the response to that an incredibly violent threat? How on earth can you think that you can make such a threat and also claim the moral highground? What does this get you? Or are you so filled with rage and hate that you don't care who you hurt or how badly?   You literally sound like an abusive partner right now. Your argument boils down to “If you didn’t burn dinner, I wouldn’t have to hit you”. You are blaming me for taking issue with your harassment.   Actually, the argument is ""If you weren't so hateful and didn't have such a history of harassment, we'd give you more chances to behave properly in the sub, instead of instantly banning you.""   For fucks sake. You're entire response to me is sticking words in my mouth, and then combining that with wholesale context substitution. ""If you didn't harass we wouldn't insta-ban"" gets read as ""If you didn't harass we wouldn't threaten you."" ""If you didn't harass we wouldn't insta-ban"" also becomes ""If you didn't insist on panty checks we wouldn't insta-ban"". Even if I had threatened you (I didn't) and even if I had accused you of requiring panty checks (I didn't), your comments make no fucking sense."
Gender_Critical,3anw1d,Shmaesh,12,Tue Jun 23 02:29:43 2015 UTC,"Not only does trans women != male bodied   not reading the rest of the TL;DR but what in the world do you think male means?   You see, when babies are born some of the babies (around half!) have penises. Those babies are referred to as male. Which means they have what's called male reproductive organs: a penis and testicles. And being born male means they have privilege in our society and when they grow up they often, due to their socialization, inflict violence, especially sexualized violence, against women (women are 'people with vaginas' in case you're struggling to follow).  And when a man thinks he's a woman because he has special feelings it doesn't change his body nor anything else because despite what Disney movies told you, your thoughts and feelings aren't magic and they can't change reality. And women still have the right not to see his wiener flopping around in the locker room or anywhere else because we have a right to privacy, and women still have every right to fear he'll inflict violence on them because 'identifying as a woman' is meaningless and changes nothing!  Do you think any woman who is afraid of sexual assault is smearing all men as rapists? This is practically MRA rhetoric. We aren't smearing all ~penis-havers~ as rapists, we're just not living in a fantasy world where 'penis-havers' can magically erase their socialization and privilege and become 'vagina-havers' by merely thinking of themselves as such and so we're aware that their crime rates aren't really going to be any different. Like, are you not aware that the vast majority of rapists have a dick and the vast majority of their victims have a vagina? So therefore having a penis means you are much more likely to be a rapist, or to commit sexual assault in general? But naw, transwomen are just magically exempt from this for some unknown reason. They aren't male because they don't believe they are. Screw biology, they have an IDENTITY!  That's our ridiculous bigotry. Not pandering to the identities of men at the expense of our privacy and safety."

The joke wasn't one about sexual harassment, it was a joke about your views on gender and sex.   Okay, I don’t give a fuck about your “intent” after the fact. You said you’d send them and thought it was funny. How is that funny?   I don’t care that you think you were “morally” right in doing so because you disagree with our views. You threatened to send them  If this wasn’t a threat, why’d you bring it up at all? You were the one who brought it up. Not a single user asked you or anyone else to verify themselves with a “panty check” but you thought it “funny” to let us know that you’ve joked about sending “hairy crotch shots” to us.   But since you seem to have trouble understanding this, let me try explaining.   Nice condescension.    not a threat to send pics, nor is it joking about sexual harassment. Now, in a different context [...]   So now women have to be mind readers and guess the intent behind the person joking about sending crotch shots? Are you for real?  You said “It’s funny to send crotch shots to prove something to women”. That is the bare bones of what you said to us. I don’t care if you think you’re somehow in the right because you think “proving” something is an excuse.   Now if you change the context, a man ""joking"" about uploading pictures of his partner may well be joking about harassment or in fact, actually threatening her.   Okay so a woman can’t complain about sexual harassment because the CONTEXT might be different to what she thinks? WHAT.THE.FUCK? So women everywhere have to be mind readers and ask for the “context” before they’re allowed to complain?   Context matters. [Blah blah blah].   You said you think it’s funny to send crotch shots to prove something to women you disagree with.  I don’t give a shit about the “context” you’ve created to make it look like you’re not a sexist pig.  The examples you’ve given are still gross and wrong. In your examples, the person “joking” is talking to a person on their side.  You came HERE to tell US that you thought it was funny. That’s like the first dude telling the people online that “If you don’t believe me, I’ll send you a crotch pic” and the couple telling the PARENTS that “I’ll send you a pic of your daughter lolololol. Funny!”.  Not just discussing it amongst themselves. You came here to tell us that you were ""joking"" about sending us crotch shots to ""prove"" things to us and essentially shut us up about your biological sex.   The joke is that your obsession with genitals means that that's the only way you'd believe us with regards to gender. We find your approach towards genitals and gender and sex amusing.    What does that have to do with threatening crotch shots to “prove” things? I don’t care if you disagree with us. We have biology on our side.  You came here to tell us that you think it’s funny to send crotch pictures because you disagree with us. That is what you did. You think it’s funny to make someone “believe” the same as you by virtue of crotch pictures.   I never said that you asked for naked photos or did panty checks. [...] It's making fun of your opinions, and your concepts of gender and sex.   Then why the crotch shot picture? You know we believe in sexual dimorphism. Why not a MRI of the pelvis, blood typing, or any of the many other ways?  I’m calling bullshit on you here.  It was a threat to send. Don’t try and flip it that because you were “joking” or because you had a need to PROVE US “WRONG” that is suddenly makes it okay for you to come here and tell us that you’d do it.   By the way, as far as I'm aware, all the ""salacious lies"" about panty checks and so on....aren't actually lies, they're jokes. People aren't spreading lies that you do panty checks or ask for photos...people are making a joke about your approach to gender and sex and how you would or could enforce it.   WHAT? So when guys say “feminazi” they’re not perpetuating the idea that asking for rights is akin to genocide of peoples, they’re actually JOKING about our approach to getting those rights. Right?  When guys say “bitch”, they’re not perpetuating the idea that women are valueless like female dogs, they’re actually JOKING about our conduct.   If by ""males"" you mean ""trans women"" ... then yes, your concerns are ridiculous. Not only does trans women != male bodied, but trans women being allowed into all women spaces doesn't increase the rate of sexual assault, and your attempts to smear trans women as rapists are gross.   Source one  Source two  Source three  And the infamous:  Dana McCallum, rapist  And I have more sources of males (which trans”women” are) attacking women in spaces. Trans”women” are male. What do you think the “M” in “MtF” stands for? Humans can’t change sex. Male and female are biological categories. If you are born male, you die male. You cannot change that. If trans""women"" weren't male, then what are they transitioning from?  You’re also pulling out the NOT ALL MEN. We never said ALL MEN (trans”women”).  We said that females have a right to be safe from male predation.  The largest study ever done on trans people concluded that males retain a MALE criminality (violent crime) post transition. That means they are no less likely than any other male to commit violent crimes.  Trans”women” are males. Their internal identity is irrelevant to their biology. Sexual dimorphism is not determined by the brain.  *edited for formatting."
Gender_Critical,3anw1d,transsnarfleblort,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:12:41 2015 UTC,Awesome replies! You really owned /u/hermithome. Love how she can't admit she's wrong.
Gender_Critical,3anw1d,hermithome,5,Wed Jun 24 02:25:09 2015 UTC,"PART TWO   The behaviour I was referring to was threatening to sic a dangerous and misogynistic mob on us.   So when you say “joking” and I say “thinking about” both are threats or neither of them are threats. If mine is a threat, so is yours. However, as I said before, I’m going into another subreddit to complain about you. That’s meta Redditing.   You telling a bunch of people that it’s funny to send crotch shots to “prove” stuff is on you. I’m allowed to go into any subreddit I want and complain. You said so yourself to the OP about what other users do when they get banned.   Threatening to get the most misogynistic hate group online to come after us...what do you accomplish?   Who said anything about anyone coming after anyone else? I said I’d expose your hypocrisy in KiA. That you say one thing (sexual harassment is bad) and then perpetuate it yourself. That’s like arguing that anyone who complains about another Redditor’s conduct in another sub is “coming after” that person.   You participate in subs that complain about other Redditors all the time (/r/WhereAreTheFeminists and SRS related subs)  I said I was thinking about exposing your hypocrisy on another subreddit. Not that I was going to 8chan or voat to call for doxx. You invented that yourself.   If you do this, there are a few possible outcomes. They turn around and laugh at or harass you. They ignore you. They do what you want and come after us.    I didn’t say I wanted them to come after you. I said I’d expose you for being a hypocrite in a sub that you can’t control or bully your way into. I don’t care if they’re not interested. I know they hate “TERF’s” too. I’d just feel better if there is a record of your poor conduct.   If you get lucky and the latter actually happens, then the result will be that you've sent a misogynistic hate group after a bunch of women.    That’s not what I said I’d do. I’m also not responsible for the fallout for your actions.  SRS type subs link to other Redditors conduct all the time, they claim they are not responsible for the downvotes and harassment that user gets.  I didn’t ask them to do anything. I’d merely post it for all to see.   They will harass us (likely methods include sending porn and gore photos). They'll try and find nude photos of us (possibly by hacking) and put them in wide circulation.    I think you’re just making shit up at this point. They already know you’re a GamerGhazi mod.   Why would my post be more likely to put a target on your back? Unless you think my complaints are warranted and that you have done something wrong?   If they can't find anything, they'll photoshop it. We will receive threats. They will try to doxx us. If they do manage to doxx us, we'll be deluged with in-person harassment, stalking and violence, possibly even swatting.   Again, why are they more likely to do this if I report you for harassment?   They know you’re a GamerGhazi mod. What would my post change? I’m reporting you for being a hypocrite in a sub I know you can’t bully to cover up what happened. I’m doing something that occurs everyday on Reddit. I’m going to complain about a user in another sub.   And if they do, you will be responsible. Not just morally,[...] but you will be legally responsible as well.   No I won’t.   You’re also trying to bully me because you’re afraid that your behaviour will be exposed. You KNOW you’ve done something wrong. I’m not legally responsible for anything. Do you…do you even know the law?  I’m allowed to complain about users in other subs. I’m not responsible for what happens after that. The responsibility rests on the people that would cause you harm, not on me. I wouldn’t call or tell them to do anything. I’m allowed to go into other subs and talk about poor Redditor behaviour.  Trying to THREATEN me with police action to stop me from doing things on this website shows how disturbed you are.   You are the one calling for my doxx. Not the other way around.  I’m saying “I’m thinking about going to complain in a subreddit you hate” and you say that if I do so YOU WILL INFORM THE POLICE.  You’re the one trying to bring about REAL WORLD consequences for me because I said I wanted to complain.   You are the one making threats.   Why is the response to that an incredibly violent threat? [...]   TIL going into a subreddit you can’t control or harass or bully to complain about your behaviour means I’m actively trying to get you killed.  Righto there. That’s some unbelievable reaching on your part.  You said so yourself, that users are ALLOWED to complain in other subreddits about you or the other mods. Or is it only in subs that you agree with that it’s okay to do so? You knew enough to stalk the OP here. Do you stalk everyone you ban to make sure they “stay” in line?   You're entire response to me is sticking words in my mouth, and then combining that with wholesale context substitution. ""If you didn't harass we wouldn't insta-ban"" gets read as ""If you didn't harass we wouldn't threaten you.""    No it isn’t. I’m interpreting your words and your behaviour. Your “after the fact” context doesn’t make a difference. I’m not a mind reader. We are talking through the internet; context and tone is almost impossible to ascertain.  That’s why most Redditors use things like “/s” to denote sarcasm because it’s incredibly difficult to determine who is joking and who’s not. We cannot rely on body language or inflection on the internet to determine who’s sincere or not.  You threatened to send pictures as a “joke”, I am allowed to extrapolate your behaviour based on the CONTEXT of that threat.   The fact that you have yet to say: “That was inappropriate and didn’t actually need to be brought up at all in this conversation. I’m sorry” gives me the CONTEXT that you are an arsehole who thinks their behaviour is beyond reproach. I’m allowed to extrapolate from that. You can’t tell anyone how they interpret things. You don’t have that right."

Jeez, you're definitely not one of the 'cool' girls. Nobody likes a narc"".  So you're telling women that they should just be complicit when people threaten to send them crotch shots or maybe even pictures of weapons. That maybe we should just smile and nod because no one wants to be with girls who DOB or COMPLAIN about sexual harassment.  ""I thought you were one of the cool girls"" - some frat douche and EXACTLY WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE.  A+ feminism there.

Gender_Critical,3anw1d,theowlgoeshoot,-11,Tue Jun 23 00:07:07 2015 UTC,"We have an FAQ that answers the question, but I'll answer anyway. We're a women's sub, and one that's fairly tightly moderated. We do allow participation from people of all genders, but we're a sub geared towards women. We're not a feminist sub, though we do have rules against anti-feminism and such.  The name of the sub was chosen in large part because we didn't have a whole tonne of options. A lot of the basic names were chosen. I believe the idea was to convey that it was a sub for women, but without relying on any of the chromosomal or other exclusionary naming systems.    GenderCritical is a ""hate sub?"" WOW. No, we don't hate. We just like science, truth, honesty.   Look around you at the comments here. Do you see what you describe? Really? One reply one this thread even threatened to go to the internets biggest misogynistic mob and sic them on us with a lie. That may be a little outside the norm for here, but not that far out of it. And while you can find complex discussions of gender here that don't rely on hatred and bigotry, they almost always include them anyway.   And a lot of the people here aren't pro-science at all. What never fails to astound me is how many of you will comment in one breath decrying gender as a construct and then spout bio-truths in the very next sentence."
Gender_Critical,3anw1d,transbasenji,18,Mon Jun 22 23:45:57 2015 UTC,"This is the problem. Feminists who have thought carefully about their position, find it internally consistent and have evidence to back it up are being stifled with ""Hate"" ""TERF"", without even having the courtesy of being told why. If it's Terf it's hate because it's hate because it's terf. And not just by your sub, either. I've read the other side, it's almost exclusively the only one available in the popular feminist and mainstream media, and I think it's wrong. I'm willing to defend my position, but it's impossible to do so, because of this outrageous intellectual stifling.You'll have to excuse the strong emotions in this sub - we're fed up."

I'd love an example of a ""bio-truth"" that has been ""spouted"" in here, because frankly your statement is incomprehensible to me. The radical feminist view is that ""gender"" is the social roles, expectations and restrictions that are put on people according to their sex. We think this is a bad thing. We want people to be able to do whatever they want, no matter what their genitals look like. Gender hurts females more than males though, so we focus on that, on liberating females from restrictive gender roles."

You can't really force changes in language like this, it isn't organic and doesn't catch on.   I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with ""he"" and ""she"" though to indicate people of different sexes. And there are other ways to be gender neutral. Don't add ""ess"" on to the ends of professions when talking about a female in a profession (""actress"" ""stewardess"" ""waitress"" ""authoress"" etc.), use alternatives for professions that often colloquially end in ""man"" (policeman = police officer, fireman = fire fighter etc.) don't use ""his"" to mean people in general, say ""humankind"" instead of ""mankind"" etc. These are changes that have already caught on, really."
Gender_Critical,3ajx4k,wanderingwomb,10,Sun Jun 21 02:23:12 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to add pronouns to the language because pronouns is a closed word class. In Sweden they have managed to introduce the pronoun ""hen"" to serve as a gender neutral pronoun (he and she is han and hon respectively, so it fits the pattern rather well). I think it's mostly used when you don't know someone's sex, which is a really useful thing. However, this thing where people pick their pronouns from a set of many different ones is a lot more unrealistic.

People are already using it, so it won't meet the natural resistance that these contrived sex-neutral pronouns will meet because it's apolitical.  Grammar pedants may say it's ""wrong"", but who says we can't change grammar rules to make it officially correct?  Grammar rules have been changed before.    As an example, hundreds of years ago, ""thou"", ""thee"", ""thy"" and ""thine"" were the proper singular second person pronouns.  ""You"" and ""your"" were reserved solely for the second person plural.  But the rules changed, so I don't see why it can't be done again.

I personally have no doubt that similarly painful socialization is inflicted upon some males – they are made to believe that their personalities are unacceptable in male bodies.

Many of the items in Moser's scale bear little resemblance to the items Blanchard used to assess autogynephilia, and even those items that do bear some resemblance to Blanchard's do not adequately assess the essential element of autogynephilia—sexual arousal simply to the thought of being a female—because they do not emphasize that element. Consequently, although Moser may have found something superficially resembling autogynephilia in women, there is little reason to think that he documented genuine autogynephilic arousal in women."
Gender_Critical,3aeayk,Reddwollff,8,Fri Jun 19 12:40:31 2015 UTC,"Well, if they really were looking at the exact corresponding thing it wouldn't be focusing on women's bodies that they already live in as the erotic target, but them having as an erotic target male bodies wouldn't it? That a woman may like or appreciate parts of or their bodies as a whole isn't the same thing, nor is feeling attractive or sexy sometimes. I think that is what was measured, not true autogynephilia.   This study where they only had 29 people respond, used a different scale and was done by nabbing women while on shift and working cannot possibly reflect the true picture either. I'm fairly sick of social scientists grabbing a small unrepresentative sample of people (usually students) and claiming a tick the box scale they fill out reflects the experience and attitudes of all people everywhere that it might apply to."

So unless he hates women so much why does he need men to behave this way? It only benefits men.  Why would he want to live in a world where females are treated as shrines for male glory? It only makes sense in the context of him being predatory towards women because his character isn't interested in men. He wouldn't want the attention.

Two dudes getting married doesn't affect anyone else. There is zero social impact by allowing it. But with transgender people being allowed in any and all private places of their chosen gender at any stage of transition does have a social impact.  Personally, I do agree with the core of what the author mentioned. I have seen and heard some horrible things from trans women (and men) about women and I don't really count on something like the author mentioned being dealt with by authority (given the victim and offender are school-age and at school)   I wouldn't say it would be extremely common but I think it could become common enough to be an issue in quite a few schools, especially if the 'gender barriers' were non-existent (eg: Any boy could declare themselves transgender and use the girls' bathroom [or locker room!

Much socialization is not explicitly gendered at all but implicitly gendered (e.g., men who do not realize how much they interrupt women even though they do so; they don't think it's ""their right as men"" or anything, it is just behavior that was tolerated in them and not tolerated in their female peers).   2) I realize it isn't meant to offend, but something is fundamentally offensive to me about the idea that I had a ""girl filter"" and that's why I grew up absorbing messages aimed toward women. I don't feel it's at all reflective of my experience, which was predicated on ""accepting"" my identity as a woman, and therefore my lot as one, as a kind of deterministic inevitability. It does not reflect the sheer coercion involved. If there had been a way out of that socialization, I would have taken it.

Gender_Critical,3a2fzy,wanderingwomb,-1,Tue Jun 16 23:12:54 2015 UTC,"How does it follow that everyone is born with some ill-defined, biological ""gender filter"" in their head that makes them sympathetic toward one or the other of these ever-changing roles...    I didn't say (at least, didn't mean) ""everyone"". Some people may have a stronger ""filter"" than others, some (anecdotally, many GNC men and women) may have very weak ones or none at all (""cis by default""). I have a pretty strong ""internal policing"" relating to status, it might just be a male thing though. Who knows.  I'll give that ""filter"" may be a poor choice of metaphor, since it may connote that the ""wrong"" socialization would always ""bounce off"". Also insofar as this ""filter"" exists, it only seems to affect some gendered patterns of behavior (such as social behavior), not others (such as interests). So I'll step out of the metaphor and unpack what I think may be happening:  A child has male genitals, but strongly believes themself to be a girl. So as they slowly learn what males do and what females do, they gravitate towards the behavior style of women by virtue of that self-identification as a girl, i.e. because they believe themself to be a girl and ""want to be a girl"", they want to do what girls do.   Wait, how does the child know that these people are males and these people are females? Why specifically filter on the fact that these are what males do and what females do? That's a very good question. There are many possible answers to this. Maybe this hypothesis is wrong!   and why should that make them have to get surgery?   I am talking specifically about social dysphoria, not bodily sex dysphoria the one that makes you need surgery and hormones."

Because right now you sound like you're operating on the assumption that gender identity is a conclusively biological thing and are attempting to work backwards from that to justify it.   A child has male genitals, but strongly believes themself to be a girl. So as they slowly learn what males do and what females do, they gravitate towards the behavior style of women by virtue of that self-identification as a girl, i.e. because they believe themself to be a girl and ""want to be a girl"", they want to do what girls do.   How is such a reaction not entirely social?    I am talking specifically about social dysphoria, not bodily sex dysphoria the one that makes you need surgery and hormones.   You said people are born with this ""gender filter"".  I also fail to see how body dysphoria couldn't be caused by social dysphoria. One is told, socially, that one is wrong for one's body, one starts to become distressed by one's body."

Boys exhibit greater rigidity than girls. If children are just looking for roles in society, we should see children at that developmental stage acquire race rigidity, but we don't.  It's just a hypothesis, though.   at least your reasoning as to what it is and how it works.   I did provide a preliminary sketch on how that thing might work."

Blacks have many more black friends than white friends, whites have many more white friends than black friends. So while there are societal roles in a very broad sense, on the individual level there is less role rigidity, only cultural difference.

It's fantastical and doesn't relate to reality.   Menstruation is a fact of life for a woman (adult human female, something NOT socially constructed but real) and if there is something socially constructed here and a choice it's the disgust they face regarding this bodily function. Women require privacy to deal with this and being forced to have those same males that torment them at school by pinging bra straps and trying to look up their skirt (and that's just the mild side of male behaviour)  in the bathroom with them whilst changing a pad or tampon is, well, sucky, disregards their needs and requires that women will have to suffer discomfort in a area they should be able to regard as private and safe for them.   As AC_Unit_On points out there is asymmetry regarding the sexes and legally this can be recognised and adjustments made to accommodate this. Transgender theory would destroy this ability to make this distinction, that is one thing the article picked up on despite being flawed in other areas. Conservatives may get it right sometimes but it's not about being for or caring for women or anything like that, but about control over women which is something both sides like to do."

Gender_Critical,3a2fzy,needs_moarsalt,4,Tue Jun 16 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"I read quite a bit from all of these groups, so am in a decent position to comment.   Whether you accept trans - and by that, I mean whether you believe a man can transubstantiate into a woman - is  orthogonal to conservatism or liberalism, and should probably be thought of as a distinct axis/degree of freedom in itself, like a religion (which it kind of is).   Arguments for accepting transgenderism exist which appeal to both conservatives and liberals.   At the present time in the U.S. and Britain, transgenderism is absolute orthodoxy in all but the fairly rightwing/conservative camps, and even there it's quite acceptable, probably because it aligns with their conservative interpretations of proper sex roles (Rick Santorum!).  The only people who'll outright reject transgenderism are the far-right, the religious conservatives, the radical feminists, a few Marxists, and anonymous online commenters, who are all a long way from the orthodoxy, or having any power to shape public opinion. If you drew a map, it would be mostly conquered by trans-orthodoxy, with a few peripheral territories a long way from one another remaining.  Last week's #transracial brouhaha opened up a bit more room for discussion on the reality of transgenderism, since it's pretty hard to accept one but dismiss the other."

This is precisely the question I have - if ""identity"" is all there is, and ""we are what we identify as,"" then why on earth did we need (and still DO NEED) the civil rights movement?  Why can't all those currently ""black"" people being racially profiled and harassed and shot by the militarized police just identify as ""white"" and call it a day? Problem solved, right?  ...of course not. And we all know why.  People like to go on about how ""race isn't real"" because ""race is a social construct.""  But social constructs can be very very real and can harm actual people. Social constructs have power.  Furthermore, the socially constructed category that is ""race"" is not applied to humans randomly.  The ""race"" you are consigned to is chosen by OTHER OUTSIDE PEOPLE, and it's based on very real physical features of your physical, material body. Some of those can be altered by makeup and surgery, others can't (and when people try to alter, it's very, very political).  Fact is, if you look a certain way because you have certain body features in certain combinations and certain number, you will get assigned to a certain race category, with all the oppressions or privileges that come with it. Of course the boundaries of categories are fuzzy, but that doesn't mean that the categories don't exist and it doesn't make this random at all.  The only people who get to ""choose"" which group they want to claim are people who conveniently appear to be right on a fuzzy border already - often people of ""mixed race"" but not always. People who have the option of ""passing"" (which is again a very political thing and has been talked about long before this Dolezal woman showed up).  People who are very dark skinned don't get the option to ""identify as white"" and have that mean that they will be assumed to be ""white"" by people who see them for the first time across a room and haven't heard of their growing up stories. Etc.  ...and this same thing applies to ""gender"" and SEX as well.  Infants aren't randomly assigned to ""girl"" and ""boy"" categories. They're assigned to those categories based on the presence or absence of the almighty PENIS. The physical, material body part, present or not at the time of BIRTH.  Once assigned to ""girl,"" you get female socialization with all that implies. Doesn't matter if you later end up to be infertile or even what your chromosomes are. It's about being born with a vagina instead of a penis, and later developing all the secondary physical traits that go along with that female biological sex (and that we, as human mammals, are pretty adept at detecting)."

Gender_Critical,39zc0a,87x8gfh,14,Wed Jun 17 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"Hendley, who was born and raised in a small town in the U.S. state of Missouri, said that when she first came out as a gay male to her parents her mother asked: 'Are you sure you're not just a girl?'...""When I came out as trans (my mother) said it made sense. Both my parents felt that way.""    Dude was stereotypically feminine as a child--as were many gay men. Dude comes out gay.  Dude's mum suggests he's really a girl.  Dude comes out later as trans.  Mum and Dad are pleased.    He was born and raised in a tiny little Missouri town apparently, which tells me it's also a very conservative/Republican dominant town and there's a high probability his parents are conservatives. Given the conservative nature of the trans cult it's not at all surprising that mum would plant the trans seed and watch it grow, and that dad would be pleased when his son decided to be trans instead of gay.   This is gay conversion, which is disturbing enough. But then things get more disturbing when the article later tries to imply that Mitchell chose to be trans all on his own.   Throughout adolescence, Hendley had come to identify as a gay male. It wasn't until high school that she he learned about transgender people. ""Once I heard the word transgender and heard stories about kids who seemed just like me - I thought maybe there's something to it,"" she he said.   **Strikethrough corrections are mine and not HuffPo's.

Gender_Critical,39yad5,veronalady,13,Tue Jun 16 04:26:01 2015 UTC,"This thread . . . bothers me. There are arguably two different groups of transgender people, but one isn't more 'true' then the other. They're all men saying womanhood is a feeling.  Transgender people aren't a monolith anymore than anyone else. There are going to be transgender people just having their own personal battles, just trying to get by, just trying to get their hormones and surgeries, and if someone calls them by their sex, they might correct them, but they maybe won't scream ""TERF.""    Most of what trans people call ""true"" transsexuals are very different from the transgender mainstream. If the typical transgender man is a straight white middle aged men, then the ""true"" transsexuals tend to be younger gay men of various races.  Many of them have probably joined the SJW tide because that's the hip thing to do, but gay men don't have as much practice in entitling themselves to women's bodies and spaces, hence I'd imagine them to be less violent towards women. But they're still men in a world where women are things, which is how they can come to understand 'woman' as a thing to be rather than a socially constructed physically-based class of people.  But these kinds of transgender people aren't ""okay."" They aren't good people, they aren't bad people, but regardless of how nonviolent or aggressive they are, they are still appropriating the female experience, they are still valorizing gender, and still reinforcing patriarchy."
Gender_Critical,39yad5,transbasenji,10,Mon Jun 15 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this comment. I agree with you. I do. I just seem to remember there being maybe a sect of the trans cult that actually respected us and didn't try to bully their way into being labelled 'female' and they actually did everything they could do to make their bodies more female-typical--unlike modern trans who are forcing us to call them 'female' without any transition of any kind.  This group of trans I remember were/are still men, but they were different in many ways to the trans cult of today. /u/antigenderist is probably quite right in saying that one group is narcissistic and dangerous whilst the other is sad, confused, and mentally ill. I imagine this particular group I remember were the sad/confused/mentally ill ones."
Gender_Critical,39yad5,antigenderist,5,Mon Jun 15 21:07:37 2015 UTC,"Part of the requirement for transition used to be to agree to ""go stealth"" after transition, i.e., blend into society as women and hide their transgenderism and male pasts. Part of trans activism has been to remove that requirement. To stop judging transwomen by ""transmisogynist"" beauty standards of what makes a real woman."
Gender_Critical,39yad5,antigenderist,5,Tue Jun 16 05:25:22 2015 UTC,"I ninja edited that part because I do not like throwing around the term ""mentally ill"". It's caused by society not the individual."

Some of them know they will do better as transitioned women for various reasons, and view it as a social process to occupy the social classification of 'woman.' That's different imo.   OP, you are not imagining this. While trans activist fuckery has been going on a long time (if, say, you look at the history of Michfest), there definitely used to be a more sane attitude among the trans majority, and the divide is evident if you look at the way mainstays like Calpernia Addams are treated by the new cohort or read this conversation. There's a ton of ageism among the crop of new trans women."
Gender_Critical,39yad5,antigenderist,11,Mon Jun 15 21:16:32 2015 UTC,I'm glad my memory isn't faulty. Thank you.

Gender_Critical,39yad5,transbasenji,7,Mon Jun 15 21:45:14 2015 UTC,One thing that I actually agree with the trans community on is that the therapists are shockingly awful. They seem to pressure patients to conform to sex role stereotypes and shame them like crazy. Bleh.
Gender_Critical,39yad5,voi_che_sapete,9,Mon Jun 15 22:05:38 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a point all of us can agree on. I feel that as gender critical feminists, we do need to realize this is the legacy of transgender politics, and that much of what we're seeing today is the result of HBS's restrictive ideas.  There is truth to the idea that trans women can't win -- if they don't pass, they are ""threatening,"" and if they do pass, they are ""reinforcing patriarchal norms."" In my opinion, we need to give trans women a clear way to live their lives meaningfully and be gender critical.   I think the way toward that outcome is to say that transition, at best, is an act of survival -- not a gender-subversive act at all. It can be triumphant on the individual level of taking control of your life in the face of a fucked-up gender system, but it is not politically triumphant in the sense that it actually helps women. The idea that being trans is this huge fuck-you to the patriarchy is one of the most harmful and flat-out wrong ideas the new cohort has developed. Beth Elliott, in the link, suggested some ways that trans women can actually help the cause in spite of that -- ""dismantling tools of the priesthood,"" etc."
Gender_Critical,39yad5,itazurakko,8,Tue Jun 16 01:07:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think transgenderism (medical transgenderism especially) is acceptable if only because we don't live in a post-gender society. We live in a patriarchy and it might be easier for some GNC males to live as transwomen for lack of a better option. I can accept that some men live and blend in socially as women. That doesn't make them women but it does mean they may have some experiences in common with women, especially if they've been living as women for a long time.   I would be happy if they acknowledged that females deserve our own safe spaces which exclude them and that women have the right to question someone's sex in sex-segregated spaces. Transwomen have been using sex-segregated places of nudity etc. It's just this new insane push to make women ignore their instincts and decline to go out in public if they can't accept males in female-only spaces."

That doesn't make them women but it does mean they may have some experiences in common with women, especially if they've been living as women for a long time.   Exactly. I think it takes a strange brand of social determinism to suggest trans women, when assimilated, are entirely different. They're not exactly the same either, but if you're genuinely living as a woman that's something to acknowledge.  I definitely agree that females deserve their own space -- I support the Intention -- and I'm 100% fine with trans women having their own spaces too. I think that's fair.   I also appreciate what Beth Elliott said about understanding where lesbians are coming from wrt female-bodied spaces, respecting their boundaries and winning their trust. Lesbians are an oppressed group and have reasons for such wariness. If lesbians want to conditionally accept a trusted trans member of their community into, say, public nudity locations, that's a totally different thing than being coerced into doing so because you are A CIS OPPRESSORRRRRR. Beth Elliott is one of those rare-seeming trans women who genuinely seems to empathize with women."

Completely apart from the ""stealth"" thing or how stereotypically a person acts, that's the part that I think has changed.  It used to be that people would happily admit to being ""born a man, decided it would be easier to live my desired life and personality in this gender-policing society if I had the body of a female, so I transitioned to get closer to that, people now judge me into that category, and now I'm a woman.""  There wasn't this ""born in the wrong body, it's all baked into my brain at the point of birth"" stuff that's currently in vogue.  Most of the time it doesn't need to even come up, but when people talked about being transsexual and what transitioning was, they were plain about it.

The people who would now be labelled trans would be mortified to talk about or have a spotlight on their trans-ness, people paying excessive attention to it (or someone's gender identity/sexuality in general) were thought of to be awkward or even downright creepy.   Mind you, most of them were lesbians with male pronouns and butch appearance. Of the guys, it was mostly gay guys that dressed in drag but they didn't identify as woman, except ironically or when performing. A lot of people in the LGBTI crowd don't like that side of the scene anyway, to each their own.  The way they acted was like they wanted to be treated like people, not circus freaks. Not everyone wants to wear their sexuality and gender label as a badge. I just keep reminding myself that this insane militant SJW minority doesn't speak for every LGBTI person."

So, to be looking at women's fashion on a tall, skinny guy with no hips, there's no way you can project yourself into those clothes.""  ""It underscores all of those body issues that we know women have. It's the world telling us that there's something wrong with us and that we'd look better in our clothes and the world would think us more beautiful if we looked like this. I think it's horrible.""  ""I'm conflicted. On one hand, I don't want to say that because you were a man and now you're a woman, you can't be in a women's fashion show. But I feel it's a dicey issue. The fact of the matter is, when you are transgender -- if you go, say, male to female -- you're not having your pelvis broken and having it expanded surgically.

At the moment France, along with other countries is banning female models under a certain BMI. I wonder along with body proportions being so different, with male models having a longer, leaner profile whether this ban will force preferences that way? It's certainly something he indicates he thinks may be likely when he talks about body issues. If they can't select for tall, very thin women (done because they think clothing fits better on that frame) it might be so which would be rather detrimental as there is already a unrealistic standard in place and women just couldn't beat that.   I'd rather than using males as a replacement for females on the cat walk they work on having more diverse body shapes for women in particular. I'd ask for more, but I think they are a lost cause for making high fashion look like something you could or would actually want to wear and know straight off it will look good on you."

It consists of conversations with scientists at Cambridge and other esteemed institutions where they cite studies demonstrating inherent differences between male and female brains, such as: babies a day old with a face hanging over them on one side and a machine on the other. Baby boys gawk at the machine and baby girls gawk at the face. At a few weeks/months old, babies left to their own devices on a mat with male and female toys tend to crawl over to the ones of their own gender, even if it's their first time seeing and interacting with such toys.

Gender_Critical,39uypw,uterusesb4duderuses,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:03:53 2015 UTC,"my dad cried at weddings and during movies that were sad. he must have actually been a woman. who knew. it's not as though men are socialized from a very young age to be discouraged from showing emotion or anything, and this ""feminine emotion"" is an excuse for these men on hormones to use it as a placebo to finally feel allowed to cry, no, it's simply the hormones.   I'll give you that there are confounding factors for emotions like the act of starting HRT. (though crying is one effect of excess estrogen. and I've heard that testosterone taken by FTMs changes the brain so that you experience more anger.)   plenty of women (unfortunately) enjoy and consume porn. plenty of men enjoy and consume erotic stories, while plenty of women don't enjoy stories nor porn. that's not a very good baseline for 'feminine sexuality'. To be honest, there isn't a good baseline for feminine sexuality besides 'needs to be aroused first', and that varies widely for all women.   Another difference is responsive versus spontaneous desire. Men have more spontaneous desire, while women have more responsive desire.  Also there is a lot of evidence (click on page 4 for a list of studies) for male and female sexual preferences being different.  So would you consider these differences bona fide baselines?"
Gender_Critical,39uypw,berindekamats,2,Wed Jun 17 03:07:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think people undergoing HRT should be compared to people who aren't undergoing HRT. I relate to exactly 0% of trans women's narratives on ""discovering"" their ""female"" sexuality. Seriously, none of it rings any bells whatsoever, from the supposed ""full-body erogenous zones"" to caring more about feelings during sex or becoming more fluid.   They are male people taking estrogen. That's not an experience I can relate to, and they shouldn't presume to relate to mine.    Which seems to suggest that these differences are biological sex differences.   You linked to a book on ""evolutionary perspectives"" -- which is therefore from a field notorious for its sexism and tendency to overreach. That isn't to say the entire set of data they draw upon is false, of course, and what you say is certainly correct for people within our society for social reasons if nothing else.   But, for instance, to illustrate how one of the points referenced in that book is problematic: a few years back a study unpacked the actual conditions on casual sex, and effectively pointed out that when women feel safe, they are much more likely to agree to it. The conflating variable is, shock, women don't feel safe around men most of the time. So that's one example about how these studies need context and thoughtful replication, and to be frank I doubt anyone with an ""evolutionary"" perspective is equipped to do that objectively."

When a woman would question my presence in the restroom all I really had to do was open my mouth and then everything would be fine when she heard my voice. The problem with this story is that it involves a male security guard. Men and women judge the sexes differently and for most men the definition of 'woman' seems to be 'someone fuckable'. This woman was not perceived as 'fuckable' by the guard and her statements that she was female and her request to present her ID were ignored seemingly because it was impossible for this one man to view her as a woman. Had she been confronted by another female in the restroom the situation very likely would have ended differently.   So now that the paranoia caused by the trans-cult is resulting in butch-appearing women being thrown out of the restrooms designated for their sex I have to wonder if we really want men being the sex police. If a man were to lay his hands on me in the way this guard did to Cortney I would react physically to protect myself and the man would have ended up injured. The women who ""don't do woman right"" are in danger, and I think it's all because of the trans cult.   Thoughts?"

If you want to discuss the topic more than I say here, please PM me.   I will say that I think there are a lot of women's issues that are important that don't get attention because they can only be resolved by teaching women better skills.  For example, negotiating. Some sources have claimed women are not as good at negotiating than men and that explains variations in salary. Ellen Pao, Reddit's CEO has recently passed a policy where workers are no longer allowed to negotiate salary. I think the policy was enacted with a concern for women, but it's a dumb reaction imo. Women can learn to negotiate if they want to learn. Banning salary negotiations across the board is a short-sighted solution imo. A better one would be to encourage women to learn the skill.  If you can find it, look up the article Haggling for Hot Dogs by Tom Chiarella. It's one of my favorite articles on negotiating.    Haggling For Hot Dogs: Tom Chiarella of Esquire decides to try and negotiate the price of everything he wants for 3 months.   I also think there are issues that women have the longer end of the stick on. Family court is a biggy. I don't think mainstream feminist address that issue much. If you've had a male relative trying to go through the family court system you can easily see how it seems pretty prejudiced against guys.

Just no that, yes, I likely strongly, and may at times passionately, disagree with most of your views.

Gender_Critical,39r32p,joseremarque,7,Sun Jun 14 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is derailing, but I really want to respond to this!  On the surface, “teaching women better skills” — like being more assertive in negotiations — seems like a sensible solution. But this ignores the fact that women aren’t ignorant, nor are they just naturally shrinking violets: They’re less assertive in the first place because they’ve learned that there will be very real consequences if they are.  “Lean Out: The dangers for women who negotiate” discusses the studies showing that women face real penalties for negotiating.   In four studies, Bowles and collaborators from Carnegie Mellon found that people penalized women who initiated negotiations for higher compensation more than they did men. The effect held whether they saw the negotiation on video or read about it on paper, whether they viewed it from a disinterested third-party perspective or imagined themselves as senior managers in a corporation evaluating an internal candidate. Even women penalized the women who initiated the conversation, though they also penalized the men who did so. They just didn’t seem to like seeing someone ask for more money.  […] It happens, too, in situations that are removed from the negotiating table: when, despite the odds, women find themselves in leadership positions. Female leaders who try to act in ways typically associated with male leaders—assertive, authoritative, directive—are seen far more negatively than males. In the modern world, we’d like to think ourselves above such base stereotypes. But that doesn’t mean that discrimination goes away; it means that it shifts from the explicit to the implicit realm.   These nasty implicit biases against women are everywhere. Just a few off the top of my head:    ""Women face distinct social penalties for doing the very things that lead to success"": https://hbr.org/2013/04/for-women-leaders-likability-a/ “The abrasiveness trap: High-achieving men and women are described differently in reviews”:  http://fortune.com/2014/08/26/performance-review-gender-bias/ ""Talkative powerful women are seen as incompetent compared to powerful men who talk just as much"": http://www.businessinsider.com/why-powerful-women-dont-talk-as-much-as-men-yale-study-2012-5   If women need to be taught anything, it's how to navigate (and whenever possible, push back against) these depressing realities."

I don't think mainstream feminist address that issue much. If you've had a male relative trying to go through the family court system you can easily see how it seems pretty prejudiced against guys.   Even if this were true, and many studies show that it's not or at least not true in the way it's commonly repeated (as a short example, men are much less likely to pursue sole custody, which contributes to their lower rates of custody post-divorce), the fact of the matter is it is one of the side effects of gender roles that have been established in society for centuries- that women are the primary caregivers for children. This in itself would not be a harmful stereotype, but it's part of the larger conservative package of gender roles that women have to bear- women are nurturing, while men are the breadwinners. Of course this can also be a burden for men too. Consider the father who wishes deeply to take paternity leave after their child is born and take an active role in child-rearing. Many countries in the west don't offer paternity leave at all, and even if they did he'd likely face social pressure to ""let mom take care of all that.""  Pointing out things like this where, as you said, women have the longer end of the stick in the face of all these other huge social, cultural, legal and institutional barriers and burdens that women face is extremely short-sighted. It'd be a bit like a billionaire telling a working class person ""hey, chin up bud, just be glad you don't have to worry about estate taxes!"""

Any fighter who doesn't go into the octagon expecting to fight a man is probably going to lose. Fallon's only defeat was to Ashlee Evans-Smith who used to wrestle on the boy's wrestling team in high school and ""would defeat them regularly."" So when Ashlee fought Boyd she knew she would be fighting a man and used that knowledge to her advantage.   After defeating Boyd she had the following to say:    ""I don't feel like Fallon should fight dudes,"" she said. ""I don't feel like she should fight women. I feel like there should be a unique organization for those needs. She did have an advantage. She definitely did.""   The fact that Ashlee had the knowledge she'd be fighting a man, and that she's a super badass, allowed her to win against him. The fact that she said after the fight that Fallon definitely had an advantage is quite telling. MMA women who fight Fallon thinking he's a woman will almost always lose, unfortunately. MMA women who fight Fallon thinking he's exactly what he is, a man who loves to beat on women, still are most likely to lose but have a better chance than the women tying a hand behind their back by believing he's a woman.   It's my hope that the rest of MMA women will recognise the reality that Fallon Fox (Boyd Burton) is a man with advantages over them that shouldn't be ignored just because the trans cult might piss their pants if those advantages are recognised."

Why is a single case of this happening considered absolute proof this is disproportional? How can anyone talk about this issue without bringing up hormone therapy, which is the central reason MMA tournaments let trans women and men compete in these matches with other women and men? Lets have a discussion on this.  The reason transgender people are allowed to compete with the gender they identify with is simply because of the way hormone therapy works. Hormone therapy works by suppressing one sex hormone and replacing it with another. The voice becomes masculine or feminine, facial features match the opposite sex, trans women develop a chest, trans men grow facial hair, secondary sexual characteristics of the opposite sex develop, and most significantly to this issue in trans women muscle mass is greatly reduced and in trans men muscle mass is greatly increased.

Chris was honored for his work in promoting trans visibility and LGBT inclusion in multisport and his commitment to advocating for all people to have the opportunity to feel safe, compete, and thrive in sports.[3] He is still interested in competing at the highest level, and in 2014 won two races in the male category [19][20] and won his age group in an iron-distance triathlon, finishing 4th place overall.[21] Both TRX and Odwalla are sponsoring Chris’ athletic endeavors, and Odwalla has named Chris on of its 2011 Athlete Ambassadors.

As for muscle mass, the person talking about them didn't even mention the large reduction in muscle mass trans women get. As for imprinting increasing aggression, how do feelings help in a fight? Shouldn't one just try to be focused?  As for heart size, men have larger hearts but women's hearts beat faster. As for lungs, men's lungs are bigger but women have a higher air flow rate.

Hormones cause some changes with fat distribution, but it is a lie to say this changes all aspects like height advantage, larger heart and lungs and so on that apply to males.   You can't use a bunch of selfies which don't demonstrate height etc against a typical female or even another male. You can't actually tell that from a head or torso shot with no references available to estimate body size. I've seen Laverne Cox alone, it's deceptive. Find a pic of her with women in it, actually even many guys look small against Cox.   ""What kind of feminism denies the fact that someone born a woman can be as physically strong as a man?""  Even the most elite woman sprinters can't quite do the speeds of men, they might be as strong as an average unfit guy, but we are talking elite athletes here.

The transgender athletes always put competition above the well being of their teammates (eg; Doesn't matter if it's a practice scenario, I will layout my teammate to get a point, even if that means she could get hurt.)

Where's the rage?  I read that article and so did everyone else here.  That sentence wasn't particularly angry.  This is how women get dismissed, over and over again, when they have feminist thoughts.  If you're coming over to this sub from somewhere that disagrees with us, and you're reading this now, think about that.  Think about how women are told ""you're being so ANGRY right now"" for simple disagreement in abusive relationships and beyond.  ""Although Burkett’s tone is needlessly cruel, it’s also true that she’s coming from a different political generation. She’s 68 and, she explains, her second-wave politics were based on convincing the world that women are no different than men, except for when it comes to the discrimination they’ve faced. ""  Again...her tone is ""needlessly cruel"" (because disagreement is cruel and no tone is ever kind enough!), and the ageism is palpable.  ""In a modern context, defining women in terms of the hardships we face seems not just limiting, but really sad. ""  Oppressed groups no longer get to define themselves according to how people oppress them--this seems like a great way to eliminate organized opposition to oppression!  ""Maybe the place to begin, before we demand answers of other women, is to ask ourselves, “How do I know I’m a woman?” And to get comfortable with how difficult it is to put our answer into words.""  In other words, you take away the one thing that could ever be used to define woman non-tautologically--adult human female, with female defined by female anatomy and reproductive capability, the same thing that defines ""female"" in all other vertebrate species--and insist that women go spend some time in the corner considering what ""gender identity"" means to them in the absence of that.  Which means they get to come up with things like ""I don't feel it, so I'm agender,"" or ""I guess I do identify with some feminine stereotypes, so now that's what woman means to me,"" or ""I guess I'm genderqueer/trans, I don't identify with these aspects of womanhood at all.""

I have heard the bible and have learned that Eve caused man to sin. Well, if woman upset the world, do give her a chance to set it right side up again. The Lady has spoken about Jesus, how he never spurned woman from him, and she was right. When Lazarus died, Mary and Martha came to him with faith and love and besought him to raise their brother.

Because that's something I'm totally willing to let go of.   Before Laverne Cox draped her gorgeous brown legs over a lucky sheet in a nude shoot for Allure, before “feminist” writer Megan Murphy gagged on all that Black girl magic and condemned our praise of Cox’s beauty as “anti-revolutionary,"" Sojourner Truth asked White suffragists, “ain’t I a woman?”   0_0 holy crap...  Objectification of women is anti-revolutionary, even if you are using a male body to do it.  More importantly, Black women getting the right to vote is infinitely more important than men getting to force others to objectify them. These things aren't even remotely on the same level.   As trans women and trans awareness begin to take center stage, these questions become more persistent as the face of womanhood and feminism begins to diversify.   Men 'diversify' womanhood the way Rachel Dolezal diversifies Blackness.    I can’t help thinking of Sojourner’s insistent words as I watch the ideological descendants of White suffragists who supported slavery wrestle with the notion that the face of womanhood and feminism will can no longer be theirs alone.   So apparently Black suffragists didn't contribute to modern feminism at all or anything. All the ideas she doesn't like can be conveniently traced back to pro-slavery bigots, including the ones that say objectifying people around harmful beauty standards is bad.  Meanwhile, the fact that transsexualism is a direct descendant of the medical philosophy of prescribing synthetic female hormones to fix gay men is totally irrelevant, as is the fact that transgenderism is actively supported at this current time by such forward thinking individuals as Pat Robertson and progressive publishing platforms like the libertarian republic.   These critiques rest on idea of Black and/or trans bodies  being oversexed, grotesque caricatures of womanhood. White women are the only true women, the rest of us are just playing at it.   Being born Black is totally the same thing as spending thousands of dollars of surgery on body enhancements, cosmetics and clothing to disguise your male sex and fit into an artificial mold.   If the White man’s burden was to bring the “savage” to civilization, then in 2015 the White woman’s burden is to teach the rest of us bumbling half-humans how to be women.   TIL women are oppressing men by resisting men defining womanhood for us. Also, this is a racism thing akin to Victorian-Era European colonization.  Colour me unconvinced.   It has become so overt and formulaic that when I opened the most recent “feminist” hot take on Jenner--Elinor Burkett's maddening ""What Makes a Woman?""--it took all of two minutes for me to roll my eyes in exhaustion.    Hold on a moment here. If your argument is that Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner is a woman despite being a man, then why is his enforcement of womanhood superior to Elinor Burkett's? Aren't they both white women to you?   “Their truth is not my truth. Their female identities are not my female identity,"" wrote Burkett--a successful, upper middle class White woman, in an attempt to invalidate trans women.   The more adjectives a woman has, the less ok it is for her to have her own experience of womanhood.   These recent articles and comments critiquing Black and trans women for the very things White women have historically and presently celebrate each other for femininity, self-definition and choosing their own paths, isn’t about defending women- it’s about defending White womanhood as the only version of womanhood   Geez. There's a lot to unpack here.  First things first: Transgenderism is not a race and it's racist as hell to treat it that way.  Second, where the hell are these articles celebrating femininity and hyperindividualism? The only dissenting article you have linked is Burkett's and half of it is expressing frustration as Jenners supposed expression of womanhood through objectifying media beauty standards. The last line of the article is responding to Jenner's excitement that he can now wear nailpolish by gently reminding him that nailpolish doesn't make a woman.  The reversal here, of men being able to define womanhood for themselves but woman doing the same as unfairly individualist, is utterly disgusting and misogynistic.   In the past, White women have had to fight to be seen as strong and capable of working outside of the home. All while Black women have had to struggle to be seen as human, to be seen as more than sexual workhorses unable to feel pain of any kind. Entire branches of medicine were built on our superhuman ability to feel nothing, entire nations were built on the idea we can toil in hot fields tirelessly, doing work no White man could be expected to. The interests of White and Black feminists could align, we are all fighting for women to be seen as complete human beings but not if the issues of White women are held as women issues, eclipsing and boxing out ours.   I totally agree with this. I also recognize it does not magically make men women or justify centering feminism around them.   Interesting to note Burkett's White cis middle class womanhood looks nothing like my Black poor cis womanhood,    But Caitlyn Jenner's White millionaire trans womanhood does?   I don't know what it's like to be in a meeting and have my breasts discussed because I'm not invited to those meetings. With natural hair and a state college education, I'm not let in to make those $0.75 to a man’s dollar. Most Black women do not. She discusses periods and birth control as defining  difficulties of womanhood, but the women I know have found their womanhood rooted in deeper, more communal issues. Becoming a Black woman in America means worrying for yourself and your loved ones when they go out, for fear of police.   Right. These are issues black women face, and they need to be more present in feminism.  How many of them are fixed by getting violent men incarcerated with women? Or celebrating objectification? Or giving white trans males space in private women's colleges? Or giving gender non-conforming children hormone blockers?   As far as I can tell? Exactly zero.   While White women fight to reclaim the word “slut,"" I am fighting for the rights of my younger sisters to be recognized as girls and human.   I'd like to believe we have this in common.   This doesn't make my womanhood less valid. it is simply different...and harder. There is no cult of girlhood, no monolithic womanhood. And if there was, surely it wouldn’t be defined by a successful White American woman, one who's privilege transcends the majority of the world's population.   Like, for instance, Caitlyn Jenner?   When she wrote how trans women do not have to fear for their safety, struggled with jobs or anything of the like,    [citation needed]   it was clear she had never considered trans women of color, specifically Black transwomen who have the highest rates of poverty, murder and suicide than any other group.   [citation needed]   I know these women fear for their safety, I know that they are afraid of walking down the street and not being strong enough to ward off attackers.    By other men.  I feel like a broken record, saying this:  Women are not responsible for male violence.  There's a lot we can do. We can fight for racial and economic equality. But when a man attacks another man for failing to live up to his standards of masculinity, it's not because women didn't validate him properly.   It is because our experiences as women diverge so wildly, not just along lines of assigned gender at birth, but along race and class lines,   Getting assigned Female at birth? That's a privilege.   that White women have to let go of the idea that their feminism or womanhood is prescriptive and universal.   Yes. What I don't understand is why that needs to be relinquished to men when men have been defining womanhood and gender in ways that hurt women for thousands of years. You do realize what you ask also implies that Black women need to relinquish their definition of womanhood to White men as well?   Critiquing marginalized women for embracing femininity is tone deaf as it ignores our history of being denied femininity.   There is a world of difference between a woman embracing femininity and a man fetishising it.   When Megan Murphy wrote that a Black trans woman celebrating her beauty ""empowers no one,"" she meant it doesn’t empower White cis women, who have never had to fight to be seen as beautiful.   TIL Media beauty standards are completely innocuous to women as long as they're white   When you are Black and/or trans you are more often characterized as a fetish object, good for private trysts or grotesque displays of sexuality. Never soft and demure as both Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox were portrayed in their now highly controversial shoots.   Laverne Cox lay naked on a bed. Jenner wore a corset.  You have a strange definition of 'soft and demure.'   Nicki Minaj took to Instagram when feminists and even conservative Blacks alike slammed her ""Anaconda"" cover art, positioning her brown body next to slim White women wearing similar clothes. She wrote simply under her photos  ""unacceptable"" and under the White women ""acceptable."" It was not praised as the feminist action it was.   Gee, I can't wonder why more feminists weren't chomping at the bit to support Nikki Minaj's spead-eagle pose on her album last December. It's almost as if feminists think the expectation that female performers are ok with being sexualised and objectified has had some negative consequences.    And I'm out of space"

Hold on a moment here. If your argument is that Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner is a woman despite being a man, then why is his enforcement of womanhood superior to Elinor Burkett's? Aren't they both white women to you?   one has a penis so she is more important than that mean old Cissie lady who also isn't as PRETTY as Jenner!  That's what's important about being a woman after all and if ur ugly, why even be a woman???    All while Black women have had to struggle to be seen as human, to be seen as more than sexual workhorses unable to feel pain of any kind.    Strange how she's totally okay with a black man (Laverne Cox) sexualizing himself and getting to decide what womanhood means.   soft and demure   if you aren't soft and demure you're not a lady.  just be a man or genderqueer already!"

She was slammed and White feminist were predictably silent; later when a White graduate did the same, it was lauded as a feminist moment.   Breastfeeding in school. That's totally a struggle trans males deal with every day.   In one breath we hear cis White women tell each other they shouldn’t/don’t have to operate with the male gaze in mind and in the next they tell Black and trans women to reign ourselves in lest we appeal to the male gaze.   The difference between the way white and black women are treated with regards to female sexuality is a real double standard. It's racist and unfair.  The difference between the way women and trans males are treated with regards to female sexuality is also an unfair double standard, in that women are raised with these expectations our entire lives and nitpicked by them, whereas trans males can adopt them as seniors (long after women would be considered viable) and embraced by the media as sexpots, getting awards for their 'bravery' doing something women have put up with our entire lives."

Now it seems that the 'what if' game can stop because there's a white woman who has disguised herself as black since around 2006/2007, attended Howard University, and became president of the Spokane, Washington chapter of the NAACP in January.   When I read this story and then read it again on various news sites trying to confirm it's not a hoax--sadly it isn't--I also failed to find anything suggesting that this woman was performing a social experiment or anything indicating that she doesn't actually see herself as being black. The BuzzFeed article even mentions her maintaining the position that she is black and she's apparently even masqueraded her adopted siblings as her own children since they are black and it helped her story.   Please tell me this and the transgenderism thing are a sick joke being pulled on the entire world and that the punchline will come soon and then it will be over. That would be nice."

Transgender people don't decide they want to be another gender, they ARE that gender. Sex is between your legs, gender is between your ears. It's not the same thing as this in the least bit. Don't disrepest trans people's existance to try and make an argument.   Apparently this trans cult activist dude doesn't realise that this woman truly believes she is black. She didn't 'decide' it either. She 'accepted her truest self' and 'transitioned'. The only difference in what she did is that she's transitioned race instead of sex.   The trans cult probably doesn't want this fact being pointed out though given that it would show the world just how far out of reality transgenderism is."

And now that we have a genuine example of someone doing that, people are actually defending it under the guise of transgenderism...which, to me, is great, because they are lumping this sexist and racist idea of being another sex or race as easy as changing your makeup, hair and clothes!!!"
Gender_Critical,39jhrx,mrsgetlost,3,Fri Jun 12 05:15:41 2015 UTC,I genuinely do not understand how people can claim trasngenderism is valid but transracialism is not.   Race is just as much of a social construct as gender.   Racial passing has a very long history. I read some where that some of Jefferson's children with Sally Hemmings lived as white men and passed easily because of their red hair.   There are diseases like vitiligo that can cause loss of skin color in black people. You also have situations like this one where twins are born and one is white and the other black.   http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/03/living/feat-black-white-twins/
Gender_Critical,39jhrx,Sojourner_Truth,16,Fri Jun 12 06:45:38 2015 UTC,"How is this different? Why is transracialism offensive because of racial oppression but transgenderism ok in spite of sex oppression?  It never ceases to amaze me how quick people can be to recognize exploitation by race, or religion, or sexuality, or disability... But the moment it happens by sex, suddenly it's ok. Because it's 'innate'. Maybe I was naive to think it was contained within sexism. I just figured sex was special because patriarchy was that pervasive and ancient. I never believed hyperindividuslism was magnetic enough to pull another axis of oppression down with it.   I hope this is the last we ever hear about something like this. Genderist exploitation of womanhood is horrific. I would never in a million years wish something alike on Black Americans."

The writer Ta-Nehisi Coates explained the social, not biological, foundation of race in the modern age:   Our notion of what constitutes “white” and what constitutes “black” is a product of social context. It is utterly impossible to look at the delineation of a “Southern race” and not see the Civil War, the creation of an “Irish race” and not think of Cromwell’s ethnic cleansing, the creation of a “Jewish race” and not see anti-Semitism. There is no fixed sense of “whiteness” or “blackness,” not even today."

Gender_Critical,39jhrx,berindekamats,2,Fri Jun 12 08:02:35 2015 UTC,"This article, and especially the comments responding to it, are interesting. The author of the piece makes so many poor arguments.   Why Comparing Rachel Dolezal To Caitlyn Jenner Is Detrimental To Both Trans And Racial Progress  I just love the title. Of course making the comparison hurts the progress of the  transgender cause, it highlights how ridiculous it is to call people women just based on their feelings!   And yet, despite overwhelming criticism, some commentators have questioned whether Dolezal has done anything wrong. Many have pointed to her living as a black woman as an example of something known as #transracial identity, even comparing Dolezal's story to Caitlyn Jenner's transition.  But let's make one thing clear: transracial identity is not a thing.   HA! I think this commenter nails it here...   Andres Miguel ·  Top Commenter · Mexico City, Mexico  Let me be clear: gender transformation has existed since time immemorial, just as racial ""passing"" or the adoption of ethnic identities not ones own has existed since the dawn of human culture. But the modern notion of ""transgender"" (or gender dysmorphic) has only existed since the DSM-III classified it as such in 1980.   Thus it is a ""thing"" only insofar as the mainstream recognized it as worthy of recognition. The fact that what some are calling ""transracial"" has not been validated by mainstream discourse does not mean that racial transformation is inherently invalid, as Brianna might suggest.   And this commenter:   Jeremiah Jackson · University of Washington  Your arguments:   ""Transracial identity is not a thing."" Actually that's not an argument. It's an opinion that you don't bother to support. How do you know it's not a thing? FOX News says gender dysphoria isn't a thing, you say transracial identity isn't a thing. Who do I believe? Some kind of red herring about McKinney. What does that have to do with this story? Nothing. ""Dolezal is not trying to survive. She's merely indulging in the fantasy of being 'other.'"" And Jenner is not? You can't just make assertions if you're not willing to back them up.   The question everyone is asking, and the question you haven't answered, is this: If someone can have gender-reassignment, why not a race-reassignment? After all, race is way more of a social construct than gender.    And this commenter...I love this remark because it recalls the arguments trans people use in regards to hermaphrodites and other rare genetic disorders.    Martha Coburn · Jacksonville, Florida  And it says that skin color defines race, but there are twins of mixed race couples that are each one of the colors of the parents, ie. one black child and one white child, but each of those children is black and Caucasian. Skin color does not identify race. We know that. I have known a 15 year old black male who claimed to be transracial. He said he was a white person in a black body and he really meant it. It was a difficult situation for him and the other kids ""got it"" about him. He was in a high school that was 85% black and they all hoped he got into something next, whatever it was that was 85% white. They knew he would be happier.   Anyway, there is a taste. I am just loving this story popping up in the middle of the Jenner hoopla."

This is quackery, and I have no doubt that future generations will look back with horror at the idea that we allowed this to be done to children."
Gender_Critical,39f32q,thrwpllw,7,Thu Jun 11 12:41:34 2015 UTC,"I still reflexively use ""gender"" to refer to the sex-based caste system and the assigned roles therein, as second-wavers originally used it.  But you're right that few people recognize that definition any more."
Gender_Critical,39f32q,thrwpllw,4,Thu Jun 11 16:07:47 2015 UTC,"That's my biggest problem with the legislation. It has ""gender identity"" written all over it, and it outright says that any attempt to ""reverse the gender identity of a child"" is the same thing as conversion therapy. Proponents of this bill say there's no evidence that gender identity can be changed, when in fact there is no evidence that gender identity is even a real thing (besides, aren't they always telling us about how gender identity is ""fluid"" - if it's fluid then obviously it is not immutable). This whole law is extremely poorly written and very poorly thought out. It uses the language of the homosexual liberation movement and just applies it to transgenders. Now, questioning someone's gender narrative is basically a hate crime.  And no one in the media seems to care about the huge prevalence of personality disorders among individuals with gender identity disorder.   This CBC article had a very revealing part, which to me sounds like a massive confession:   ""In most cases, we find that doesn't work because it's such an innate and internal feeling,"" said Gapka, a trans woman who links her own attempt to cover up her gender identity with feelings of guilt, shame and eventually, self-destructive behaviour that resulted in being homeless for a decade until she was able to accept herself.   So, this person basically admits to having a personality disorder, and says that the only way he was able to stop feeling shame and guilt was to basically change his belief system, and merely stop believing that his autogynephilia was something to be ashamed about. Not interested in changing the behavior, just changing his feeling toward it, and now even therapists are being forced to accept the narrative of autogynephilic men (who usually have multiple comorbid personality disorders), because questioning their narrative is questioning their ""innate and internal feelings of gender identity.""   I bet he's happy that now there is a law requiring therapists to think that his desire to jerk off while wearing women's panties makes him a woman, and if they don't, they're a bigot and their ideas/therapy methods don't belong in a civilized society."

Gender_Critical,39f32q,uterusesb4duderuses,6,Thu Jun 11 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"In many (possibly most) cases, yes, although I know there are also gender-nonconforming straight kids getting caught up in this.    I think body dysmorphia is a real and horrible problem that does deserve attention and treatment.  But the idea that cosmetic body modification should be the first or preferred treatment option is really disturbing."
Gender_Critical,39f32q,thrwpllw,0,Thu Jun 11 15:05:11 2015 UTC,"Prescribing conversion therapy for a homosexual kid should be regarded the same way as prescribing leeches for a child with leukemia...and the same way as treating body dysmorphia with plastic surgery.   Sorry, but it's false to say that sex reassignment surgery has ""no solid empirical basis"", that it never works. If I remember correctly trans people post surgery mostly report better outcomes than pre-surgery.  The fact that gender dysphoria in children doesn't consistently translate to gender dysphoria in adults should be acknowledged. But I think that your statement is way over the top."

Gender_Critical,39f32q,transbasenji,2,Thu Jun 11 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly trans people post surgery mostly report better outcomes than pre-surgery.   Success of a treatment isn't based just on how the patient feels about it, otherwise we'd happily provide liposuction for anorexics because they'd feel happy about it.   Trans people who go through transition are (as noted by another comment) more likely to commit suicide.  Their rates of mental illness aren't any lower than pre-transition rates.  So what is being ""treated""?  Personally, I remain unconvinced that gender nonconformity is a disorder at all.  The only potential disorder in the case of trans people would be body dysmorphia, and we don't prescribe cosmetic surgery as a treatment for that in any other realm.  So why should we for sex-related dysmorphia?"

Gender_Critical,39f32q,berindekamats,6,Fri Jun 12 01:41:19 2015 UTC,"Once again, so close.   The problem with gender isn't that it's some sort of vast, unscalable behemoth. The problem with gender is that it's a hierarchical social construct. And the problem with gender conversion therapy isn't that they might guess wrong, it's that they're cutting up and medicating healthy children so they fit better into society's gender expectations."

For example, we may suppose that, through habitually behaving as a sixteen- year-old, the brain activity of the seventy-year-old mentioned above “resembles” that of a sixteen-year-old’s. Does it follow, then, that the seventy-year-old really is sixteen years old? Or that he is really a sixteen-year-old trapped inside a seventy-year-old’s body? Of course not. The most rational conclusion is that such an individual has some sort of cognitive or psychological defect associated with identity and self-perception.

When these facts hit people that have not been soft-groomed for it for months, they flip out.   -soft groomed is: [This can be achieved by changing your vocabulary to include 'ciss', and a few months in, nothing surprises you anymore. This is a type of soft-grooming, and a type of brainwashing. You might first use ciss only in-front of the transperson [that flips out if you don't]. But you are being re-programmed if you are still using ciss when they are not there.]  anyway,- Jeffrey Schaler already wrote about this kind of epic failure in movements and what exactly happends:   He wrote a paper called Cult Busting [you can google]:  One way of testing the cult nature of a group is by challenging the ideology binding the group together. We can discover something about the nature of a group by how well its members tolerate opposition to the ideology that holds the group together. How well do members tolerate difference of opinion, opinion that challenges the very ideological heart of the group?  Members of the cult are like a colony of insects when disturbed. A frenzy of activity and protective measures are executed when core ideologies are challenged. The stronger the evidence challenging the truthfulness of the group ideology, the more likely members of the cult are to either lash out in a more or less predictable fashion, fall apart, or disband into separate cult colonies."

There are some things you just can't dispute, even if it hurts the feelings of (a vanishingly small minority of) people. That is, biological sex is the ground up from which womanhood is built.  Contrary to the views of some people in this sub, I don't think we have to go to a stage where we call trans women ""Sir"" and ""he"" etc.. They are simply 'trans women', and I will call them 'she', out of respect for them as people. But I will not undermine the integrity of women's experiences by saying they are 'women'."
Gender_Critical,39ai7m,uterusesb4duderuses,9,Wed Jun 10 17:53:56 2015 UTC,"Why refer to them as 'trans women' when they are in fact not women?  What does woman mean if not female, and these are males?  In office settings, of course I make sure not to offend anyone.  But in a feminist forum or setting, or in an academic or journalistic setting, there is no reason to acknowledge these people as anything but woman-hating men (or self hating women, in the case of most FTMs)."

I'm with you here, and I also differ from some in the sub in this regard. I don't think ""she"" is a sacred cow and I want to respect people's right to self-determine, as well as their lived reality in the cases of trans women who are truly living as women or genuinely in the process of doing so.   I do see the point of not using preferred pronouns in the sub as far as headlines and such go because 1) misgendering is just not the end of the universe and it's certainly not ""violent"" if the trans woman has already outed herself, sorry and 2) it helps clarify some of the power dynamics when certain trans women do act from a position of male privilege."
Gender_Critical,39ai7m,mrsgetlost,3,Thu Jun 11 03:38:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's funny, I use preferred pronouns face to face, even with people I don't respect. My reasons aren't straightforward, though. Partly, yes, it's to not hurt people's feelings. But partly it's just because it's actually just expected of you, and can't not do it without having to offer everyone present a dissertation on feminism. Because trans have so completely dominated this dialogue, people seriously think if you don't use pronouns there's no principle behind it, you're just literally hitler. So it always feels coercive to me, and a betrayal of what I believe. It's like your boss insisting you call him Sir. The thing is, if it wasn't for transactivism, I'd just be ""Fine, whatevs"" about it."

It's absurd to reduce an entire gender to one experience, thought, feeling, action, whatever. It is really sad to be honest. Reducing an entire gender and by extension, billions of human experiences to one thing is just sad.  And the fact that the transgender allows and even further, proclaims this as the marker for being transgender is disgusting.   Rather than following, you know, the name of their fucking 'movement', they support what they are trying to get away from... what?   This is just one reason why I am completely disgusted with the trans community. I do believe ""true"" transsexual people exist, for whatever reason whether biological or psychological (meaning, I believe the 'transsexual condition' is something you are born with or predisposed to develop [like many other psychological issues]).   But I completely disagree with this whole no dysphoria, only needs to like gender-stereotypical activities or clothing ""diagnosis"" process.  [End short reply, my overall reply tone won't change but add'l info will be added]  If you don't care to read the words / feelings / whatever of a transgender person about their experience, stop reading because that is what this is.    I remember back when I first thought I was transgendered. I was hugely misandristic (Not a word you hear much sadly, it sounds weird in my head. :)) and on some levels, despised who I was proclaimed to be by people around me and I really did buy into the whole ""women must like shopping, have to be into fashion, etc"". I wouldn't have called myself misogynistic, but looking back I did hold some pretty unfair / absurd ideas about women which would be seen as covert misogyny.   I did have 'bodily dysphoria'. I didn't like what hormones were doing to my body and I was becoming distressed about the changes. This was only amplified by my mother increasingly telling me how masculine I was (""Oh, you'll be bald by 25"", ""Just wait, you'll have a full chest of hair soon"", etc.)   So I had all of this social pressure about becoming a ""man"", combined with the 'dysphoria' about what my body was going through... and something I still don't like to admit is that I was constantly (at least two or three times a week) told that I was a girl, that I might as well be a girl, essentially they were saying: ""We are ashamed to call you a boy"" (I am using the non ""grown-up"" words for the sexes as this happened during my teenage years but feel free to change in your head as you see fit).   This is a massive simplification of what caused me to identify as transgender and later transition but it captures the spirit of what was going on when I started identifying as such.  What I am meaning by this is: There is a lot of really fucked up social and bodily pressures to become someone that you might not want to be. I didn't want to be(come) a man, I didn't enjoy being / becoming a man, I never wanted any part of it because I didn't choose it.   Being transgender was supposed to be how I freed myself from those pressures and somehow allowed myself to live as I felt I should (Given that I 'passed'). But all I found were tighter binds and more pressure. I was constantly being told I wasn't ""girl"" enough, asked when I was going to start ""dressing like a girl"", just constant pressure... except now it was coming both ways (""Why don't you look more like a girl?"" from trans people and ""You'll never pass, you'll be bald by 25"" from my parents). So identifying as transgender in many ways only amplified the issues.  Sorry for the rant, trying to wrap this up nicely.   Anyway, I really wish someone had taken me aside at 16 - 18 and told me that it was okay not be super manly or follow masculine stereotypes. That there might be another way than following a tough road with lots of challenges (Admittedly, my parents did say this... but not in a nice, receptive or understanding way). I wish someone had been sane enough and kind enough to comfort me and tell me I wasn't a fuck-up of a boy or something.   Promise, final word: I am really glad I found gender-critical feminism. Oddly (or not oddly) it has made me a lot more comforted in who I am. I know that I don't have to be hyper-feminine or hyper-masculine or anything. I can exist as me and be happy.   Sorry for the absurdly long reply!!! This post just struck something in me."

Gender_Critical,398gg2,needs_moarsalt,5,Wed Jun 10 00:33:35 2015 UTC,"When I heard trans jargon for the first time, - ‘This is defiantly Cult-speak’.  The use of 'ciss', 'gender' and changing words' meanings like 'women' to include men- is a type of programming cults do to reprogram common sense and stop members from thinking with slogans.  I refuse to ID as 'ciss'. When you start using ciss, you have submitted to their re-programing scheme.  If you read  'animal farm', the sheep were given slogans to chant because the concepts were too complicated for them to understand. ""Two legs bad, four legs good"" became the sheep's chant.  Two legs good, four legs bad, is the equivalent of ""TERF"" and ""ciss"" that followers are exposed to, and these guys use time honored techniques used by cults to encourage many teens to leave home if their parents wont let them experiment with hormones. What teen doesn't feel awkward about their body?  and from #5 on the list.  The cult has its own language. The cult invents new terminology or euphemisms for many things. The cult may also redefine many common words to mean something quite different.[like ‘woman’] Cult-speak is also called “bombastic redefinition of the familiar”, or “loading the language”.  “Loaded Language” is one of Dr. Robert J. Lifton’s Eight Conditions of Thought Reform — an essential part of any effective brainwashing program. The cult-speak may include a bunch of well-worn slogans, which Dr. Lifton called “thought-terminating clichés. The special words constrict rather than expand human understanding, and the slogans stop thought.  Beginners have to learn all of the new terminology in order to fit in, and understand what is being said. Then, the new language has the effect of separating the newcomer from his old world, and from his old circle of friends. His new cult friends will tell him that “Only another cult member understands”, and it will be true. When he babbles nothing but cult-speak, nobody but another cult member will be able to understand.  Loading the language and redefining words has a long history. Lewis Carroll described it very well in the Alice in Wonderland sequel, Through the Looking Glass"
Gender_Critical,398gg2,clomjompsonjim,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:34:11 2015 UTC,"The way the trans cult forces people to ""become"" trans is truly appalling but also quite simple in the psychology side of things. If you belong to any ""group"" or ideology you're likely to jump on some bandwagons before thinking it through (I've done this with some radical feminist theory, and other political things). But the cultiness of trans-genderism is really extreme.  I once briefly dated a woman who was (at the time) very libfemmy, extremely pro-trans and identified as ""queer"" rather than a lesbian (she is a lesbian). She is relatively ""butch"" (she used the term for herself). All her friends from her queer groups etc were transgendered and she mentioned to me a few times that she felt ""dysphoria"" about her breasts and wore a binder on occasions. One day I asked her why. She couldn't explain. I asked- are you transgendered? She said no. And she looked really uneasy for a few moments as if something had dawned on her. I told her simply that her body was nothing to be ashamed of, and that all women feel ashamed of their body at some point.  She did reel off a fair few transcult slogans over time, but I was never fully open with her about my being gender critical (we didn't date for very long). She eventually started getting sick of how ""lesbian"" had become a dirty word in her circles and stopped identifying as queer. Then, she had a small crisis. She said to me ""I'm really confused about my sexuality right now, maybe I'm not a lesbian...."" me: ""Why?"" ""Well you know my friend x? we used to date...."" me: ""So?"" ""Well they are a nonbinary person."" (I have met this person, she is a woman). me: ""........so?"" ""well does that mean I'm not a lesbian?"" me: ""Okay this is getting ridiculous. Are they female? Ie, do they have a vagina?"" "".....yes..."" me: ""It's ok. you're still a lesbian"".   In a roundabout way I think this assault on her sexuality from the transcult turned her around and now she's a really involved gender critical radfem :) but for each one that leaves they convert five more   :("

You don't get to pick your sex any more than you get to pick your species.  Your sex isn't determined by your feelings; feelings aren't facts.  Your sex is determined and identified (not ""assigned"", unless you have an intersex cdndition), by clear biological criteria.  I can understand being uncomfortable with the stereotyped expectations of your sex and even believing that life might be easier as a member of the other sex but, in the end, you don't get to pick your sex.  You have to play the cards that your biology dealt you.  You can, however, pick what kind of a man or woman you want to be; there's not only one way to do it.

And it kept not ending for a ludicrous amount of time. The final result would have taken about four separate, max length, reddit comments, to post here, so I tossed it on a random markdown-enabled text host here.  Below are some select snippets for those who don't have the time or desire to read the full thing, or who want to know beforehand approximately what it'll be like.     It's written with a sympathetic tone,   No one in the universe tries to convince people by being unsympathetic.     I'm going to present a take-down of her arguments here   You're going to try, anyway.     the tactic Burkett takes in this opinion piece is to critique Caitlyn Jenner as a means of critiquing all trans people.   Ah yes, the time-honored tradition of taking a look at an individual, and pointing out things that they have in common with other people in their group. Not the height of science, sure, but a good way to make a point.     throughout the piece, Burkett makes sure to refer to Caitlyn as Bruce, Mr. Jenner and ""he"" as often as possible.   Bruce.  Bruce. Bruce.  Bruce.Bruce.Bruce.Bruce.Bruce.Bruce.Bruce.Bruce.  Okay, now I'm just doing it to annoy you, sure. How about you stop whining that someone's using the ""wrong pronoun"" for a rich white person, and actually try to make some points that actually matter in the slightest.     and so some trans people turn to this idea when asked to justify themselves.   Literally no one as ever asked a trans person to justify ""themselves"". What they've been asked to justify is why they think they are, or should be, the opposite sex.     and just respect our self-report of what our gender identities are.   Either ""gender identity"" isn't real, or I'm literally a wizard. Pick. One.     Apparently Elinor Burkett believes that hormones produce no effects, or only affect physical things like breast or beard growth, so that to say hormones influence one's experience of emotions is an antifeminist delusion.   You need to demand a refund on your reading license. Of course hormones can affect one's emotional state. The point is that hormones cannot magically make a man into a woman, and that being emotional does not magically mean that someone is a woman.     Burkett frames Caitlyn Jenner and Chelsea Manning as representatives of all trans people   (Emphasis mine.)  She, never, did, that. LEARN TO READ!     And by asserting their dignity as trans people, trans women are proving themselves to be really men   Uncategorically demanding that women give them whatever they want is not ""asserting their dignity"".     This is ridiculous on so many levels it's hard to list them all.   That's because you've conflated ""sex"" and ""gender"" into one concept, and started assuming that Dr. Burkett said something she didn't. I'm going to skip your four paragraph long ""rebuttal"" here for the sake of my remaining sanity.     This implies a trans woman doesn't know what a ""real"" female identity is, while Burkett does.   For the eleven billionth time, we don't care about your ""identity"". We care about the harm caused to women by men, and how the trans movement is hiding that harm by trying to make everything about self-identity, rather than physical reality. Hell, I'll even be generous and say that probably most trans advocates aren't even purposefully trying to belittle that harm. What they advocate has consequences for other people though, and they need to be aware of them.     The second fallacy comes from framing all trans women as being like Caitlyn Jenner   I'm in Hell aren't I? That's the only reason I can think of for why you continue to insist that Dr. Burkett thinks all trans people are the same. If I am in Hell, I'd just like to let Satan know that I'm coming to take over, and he can either surrender peacefully, or be forced to read this entire stupid article, TWICE!     What Burkett would say about ...  trans individuals who come out as children in supportive families ... I do not know, because she doesn't address them.   You realize that this whole ""trans"" thing hasn't really been around long enough for many kids to grow up as ""trans"" right? Such (mostly hypothetical) children are irrelevant to the discussion, as the discussion was not about them you incompetent- Ahem. Excuse me, I seem to have gotten a bit worked up there.    LEMONADE IS NOT LIMEADE IS NOT LEMONADE!     Eventually, Burkett gets around to talking about trans people other than binary trans women.   Oh, right, 'cause the rest of you are all such special unique snowflakes and I just want to drown myself right about now so please stop with your bullshit about how everyone is different and not remotely similar in any way because that would be boring and not special enough and I'm going to stop typing now because I'm running out of air as I say this and have been over this more times than there are atoms in the entire universe.     Burkett mocks the use of alternative genital and reproductive terms in her piece as ""politically correct"" nonsense.   So you're not going to rebut that?  ...  No? Okay then. Not really sure why you brought it up.     Another source of panic for Burkett   It's not panic, you moron.  Also, I apologize to anyone with mental disabilities, as comparing you to this author was rude, and uncalled for.  …  I think I used that joke already.

Gender_Critical,394j3i,prudemare,14,Tue Jun 9 09:39:32 2015 UTC,"The reason there are a lot of these posts here is because when we have brought up concerns about sex-segregated facilities being open to anyone who identifies a certain way, we have been met with people saying that ""no man would dress up as woman in order to sneak into women's bathrooms"". But it DOES happen - and it should be a concern to transwomen as well as other women. Because if you can go into the facilities of the other sex just by claiming to be the other sex, then by definition they are no longer sex-segregated. And to women, who are often wary of men in their private spaces, seeing someone who is obviously male in their dressing rooms or toilets is going to be alarming. You can't tell if someone is a man or a non-passing transwoman just by looking.   Does that make sense?"

Things associated with women are deemed frivolous and below the attention of men. Men are the heroes and the authorities, women can be role-models but only for girls, if a boy sees a woman or a female character as a role-model then the immediate thought is something is wrong with him, or worse he needs to be punished or corrected.  Take a look at the casual sexism in and advertisement like this, a woman's handbag is apparently so undesirable and shameful to be holding that the man in the ad is literally applauded as ""uncompromising"" for making sure he isn't seen with it.   This was aired on television just a few years ago.  So with all these messages that being a woman or anything like a woman is undesirable, frivolous and inferior while being a man is propped up as admirable, superior, the default is it any wonder some women may find themselves with feelings of not wanting to be associated with ""woman""?

Unlike a male transgenderist who would consider such a thing an 'act of violence' and then punch the woman confronting him in 'self defence', I knew how I looked and that I was stereotypically masculine and that the women confronting me about my presence in the restroom or locker room had a legitimate concern.

You're supposed to check off every item in a woman's list of what she wants in a man. That's why if you're a guy who can be attractive to and sleep with lots of women you're considered awesome. Guys are expected to be a good provider, skillful, smart, funny, be socially dominant, be a leader. If you lack one or more of these qualities you will be considered unattractive or disgusting.

Hmm, that suggests the question ""Why do I have to be hot?"" I.e. is being hot and feminine simply instrumentally useful to your life (e.g. ""being hot gets me more romantic choices"")? Or do you place an intrinsic value in being hot and feminine, do you feel deeply validated from being seen as hot (Perhaps even ""I'm not hot enough, therefore I'm a subhuman freak/feel invalidated"")?"

I don't consider myself trans or cis, just shaped by my biology and the accompanying social expectation...   Many men also have their worth wrapped up in being attractive to women, it's just about fulfilling different expectations.    It's also not that direct, though. The disparity between what women tend to find attractive in our culture and what men think women do is quite stark... for instance, men tend to think the musclebound look is ""male hotness,"" when studies have shown a softer look tends to be popular among women. Meanwhile, women are pretty well aware of what men like -- I mean, the male gaze is everywhere and you can't escape it and frankly marketing caters to it pretty effectively as studies show. IMO that's because women have to be very realistic about this sort of thing.   So I think for men it's more like this issue where if they fulfill their masculine obligations -- success, humor, strength etc -- women can't help but like them. With women, their feminine obligations are be attractive (or motherhood, which is a separate thing).   Hmm, that suggests the question ""Why do I have to be hot?""    If you look at charts comparing perceived attractiveness and salary, you'll find that (with some interesting complicating variables, like looking 'too' hot or a bimbo) there is a powerful relationship that isn't there for men. Women are considered more competent, more loveable, and better people if they're attractive. So it's not so much about validation as an understanding of the reality that their looks mean a great deal to society and will impact how they get on in the world.   I do think, though, that women who don't feel attractive do feel subhuman, invisible, unloveable etc."

We babysat him, and his family babysat my kids for a while, I've known him since he was quite young. I guess I know him pretty well. It's just interesting to see this develop first hand.  The thing is, before any of the trans stuff started happening, he was a pretty disturbed kid. He had an horrifically abusive childhood and was adopted by this guy I know. He had to have therapy for anger management problems and things like that, he couldn't read, his birthday had never been celebrated until he was adopted when he was seven, pretty awful stuff.  And he hates girls. He won't hold my hand crossing the road, for example, because I'm a woman. Worse still, he's punched girls a couple of times at school, and he really fucks with them in other ways too, trying to get them in trouble and so on. This is the reason my kids, and other girls I know, don't play with him any more, although his family blame everyone else but him.

Unless society changes absolutely dramatically from now until that time you raise her, your child will also be influenced by the culture she is surrounded by, which will bombard her with messages that her worth is tied to her attractiveness, that being aggressive is unattractive, and will not reward her for being assertive in the consistent and enthusiastic way it rewards her male peers.

There's definitely a case to be made that some sports are better-suited to the male frame -- like, for instance, basketball, opposed to sports more tailored for females. The testosterone argument is true, MtFs often obliterate their testosterone to levels well under that of females (and females are far more sensitive to it than they are to begin with), but testosterone is a complicated beast.   An MtF's hormonal profile does not match a female's. Period. They can mimic a female hormonal profile, but they will never respond to hormones the same way and their bodies will not use them in the same way.

There's a reason trans people tend to take anti-androgens. This kid is more opposed to going through male puberty than the racing girls are to competing with someone who has.   Letting boys run in girls races sets up women later in their athletic careers, when sex differences DO matter   Except that at the point where sex differences do matter, guess what this kid is going to have? Tits and hips. Guess what this kid ISN'T going to have? Testosterone. You're opposed to MTFs racing with the girls because you say that they'll have an unfair advantage due to testosterone. The opposite is true. This kid will, at that point in time, have a doctor that prescribes doses of medication to do the following: regulate the kids hormone levels to match as exactly as possible to the levels of hormones the non trans girls have. If this kid raced with the guys, there'd be no chance. As you say, how can someone with estrogen and no testosterone be expected to compete with someone who has testosterone and no estrogen?   they ALL get to get in, just by ""self-identifying""   Let me fix that for you:  They ALL get to get in, just by meeting with a therapist regularly who gives them permission to take doses of anti-androgen and estrogen, which makes their physical capabilities equal to those of anyone born female, nullifying any special advantage they would otherwise have, and also causes them to experience female puberty. Those are the actual guidelines. They don't let just anyone compete on the female team if you're MAAB, you have to be on spiro or lupron, consistently and you have to have been on it already for a long period of time before the date where you apply to be on the team.

Gender_Critical,38u4bp,a_socialist_feminist,16,Sun Jun 7 19:08:31 2015 UTC,"Great editorial!  I think critical articles like these in liberal sources could be the beginning of Bruce Jenner's veneration backfiring, spurring the exact type of conversation that trans activists do not want to have.  Say what you will about Laverne Cox and Janet Mock, but they confirm what a lot of people believe about transgender women.  They're feminine, attractive, they pass, they're attracted to men and they transitioned young, including genital surgery.  The only thing new about them is that they say the right things politically.  Bruce Jenner though raises a lot of questions.  Why would a 65 year old man want to transition?  How does he expect people to consider him a woman when he still has a penis?  What does being a woman mean to him?  People have already begun to ask these questions, and god forbid someone decides that autogynephilia is the answer they're looking for (Jenner is basically a textbook example).  I don't think trans activism will be able to handle that sort of PR nightmare.  Online it might work very well to make people scared of being labeled a ""terf"" or a bigot, but I don't think that will fly so well in the greater discourse.      Jenner's already said things which don't follow the new trans politics, like how he's talks about ""Bruce"" and as ""Caitlyn"" as two separate entities, or how he bristles at being described as anything but heterosexual.  Which is to say, if he's always been a woman then he hasn't got the memo.  The more the media focuses on him, the greater chance he'll say more things that trans activists do not approve of, or more explicitly sexist things.  He is, after all, still a rich, white, right wing man.  When people see how little he's changed I don't think people will be quite as uncritical of him as they've overwhelmingly been."
Gender_Critical,38u4bp,repugnent,8,Sun Jun 7 03:39:43 2015 UTC,"Here is the third most reccomended comment on the NY Times' site:   The big secret among the late, straight male-to-female transitioners is the strong sexual/erotic component to their desires to transition. Academics who have researched the topic, like Michael Bailey at Northwestern and Ray Blanchard at the University of Toronto, call these transitioners autogynephiles--men who become sexually aroused at being perceived as female, and they have received death threats (as have many feminists who have dared to criticize/question the trans movement) from these men, and they are men. As the author notes, there is no ""female"" or ""male"" brain. To base gender on self-reported ""feelings"" instead of biology is absurd (and the feelings of these late male-to-female transitioners is of mostly sexual arousal in any case). To top it off, these male-to-female transitioners typically take on and relish in the most misogynistic, stereotypical backward views of what it means to be female, e.g., getting their nails and hair done, wearing high heels, going shopping for clothes, engaging in ""girly"" talk with girlfriends, being ""glamorous"" sex objects for men, enjoying soft fabrics, being less logical and more in touch with their feelings (these are typical reasons that many transgenders claim to be female inside), instead of the qualities that many women have that make them proud to be female--nurturing, motherly, sacrificing, multi-tasking, managing the household."

Males failing to meet the standard of masculinity are relegated to a class defined as 'effeminate'--which of course is just indicative that males consider 'female' to be an inferior class.   And what about us? 'Woman' for most of us (exceptions for a few actual intersex women and women with other medical issues) is the label forced on us usually sometime between the age of 9 and 14 when we get our first period.

This is something I see too little analysis of. It's at the heart of why trans women erroneously deny that they had male privilege, but there's no doubt that it's a very complicated situation and that such males are in the crosshairs of homophobia, which is of course its own very potent form of oppression. In the future I would like to tease out the ways that being a 'sissy' might impact male privilege and present its own sort of fucked-up socialization that can't just be reduced to male socialization as heteronormative males experience it, even if it's not at all female socialization either.    Suddenly I 'became a woman' eight years before adulthood just because my uterus had turned on its 'vacancy' sign.    I always felt that ""becoming a woman"" was something I had to accept.

Gender_Critical,38okua,berindekamats,10,Fri Jun 5 20:41:06 2015 UTC,"In the future I would like to tease out the ways that being a 'sissy' might impact male privilege   I dont think it does impact male privilege, because male privilege refers only to the male-female hierarchy, not the hierarchy that exists between men. The lowest men are still privileged over all women, and that's what the concept 'male privilege' describes.  The hierarchy that exists between men is also significant of course, but this hierarchy needs to be defined and described with different terminology from male privilege. It's really up to men to develop that political language. Though so far, men appear unwilling to tease out the particular ways the male-hierarchy effects them and their status in society. Instead they just deny they have male privilege, which does them no favours because they do have male privilege, and it is easily demonstrated.  If trans women (and other male-privilege deniers, like MRAs who are generally ""beta males"", and some gay men etc) were smart, they would put the effort into developing a theoretical framework which describes and addresses the male-hierarchy. Then we (meaning gender critics / feminists) could actually invite them to the table, so to speak, and we could all make some progress on this stuff.  But they haven't even taken the first steps to define ""alpha privilege"", and I'm not holding my breath.  Men are incredibly resistant to shining a light on the male-hierarchy. They'll say ""well I'm trans / gay / beta / sissy, so I'm not as privileged as the alpha men"", but they never take the analysis much further than that. This is because even the lowest men benefit from the male-hierarchy, because it has a symbiotic relationship to the male-female hierarchy. Being low on the male hierarchy is a price some men pay (and it's a high price for the lowest men), but in return they get to hold privilege over all women. They like this arrangement, more than they dislike it, otherwise they'd put more effort into addressing it.   EDIT -  I think this is also an important factor - the other reason why the low status men don't address the male-hierarchy is because they don't want to piss off the high status men. It's much easier for them to just direct their ire at women (ie, the whole MRA movement)."

The lowest men are still privileged over all women, and that's what the concept 'male privilege' describes.   As someone who has experienced this, I think that you're completely right. I had a slightly different socialization, but I still definitely picked up a few of the hallmarks of masculinity -- even though as an 'effeminate' man I was not included in male groups my age, I still had social pressure from family/media/society to conform at least partially to what it means to be masculine. In doing such, I definitely retained my male privilege in my interaction with women.  I actually feel that it made it harder to notice that this was a dynamic that I was playing out, as I had a clear example of the exaggerated 'alpha male' interaction, and I knew that wasn't how I was interacting. I felt like I was one of the good guys, not realizing that my toned down interactions were yielding exactly the same results while giving me an unwarranted sense of self righteousness.  For instance, what seemed like non-authoritative statements to me -- and were interpreted as such by the guys that I knew -- came across as assertive by most women that I interacted with. Noticing this has helped me to tune my interaction further and engage on a much more meaningful level.  Being low on the male-hierarchy is seen as a high price, but it seems apparent that this cost is shifted to women -- look at male nerd culture's zealous use and defense of pornography. Given low male-status and easy access to a form of violence against women, the exploitation of those lower in the hierarchy is celebrated and 'natural'."

I use the framework of feminist analysis to explain all sorts of male-male relations."
Gender_Critical,38okua,rococo_redux,3,Sat Jun 6 01:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right - feminist analysis does go a long way in describing male-male relations. But I also believe a lot of aspects of the male-hierarchy are invisible to feminism because they are simply invisible to women, or at least cryptic.   The male-hierarchy is highly contextual. Dividing men up into alphas and betas is a simplification, because few men are ""always alpha"" or correspondingly ""always beta"". Status changes depending on the situation. I think this is why men are so quick to establish formal hierarchies among themselves, because otherwise dealing with the constant fluctuation of status would be too distracting and they wouldn't get anything else done.   masculinity is also contextual. Some things codified un-masculine become masculine depending on who's doing them and/or the situation.   It also goes back to the original thread topic - ""more of a woman than you'll ever be"" is a baffling statement to women, because ""more of"" or ""less of"" doesn't really apply to womanhood. On the other hand, manliness is relative and comes in degrees, and men constantly challenge and call into question each other's manliness. But when they try to apply this to womanhood, it doesn't work.   As a woman, I've observed that the male hierarchy fluctuates depending on circumstances, but I can't really describe the mechanisms behind the fluctuation - I'm not privy to the inner workings of relational male power (and I wouldn't want to be, it seems exhausting!)   Men haven't developed a coherent framework with which to analyze this male-hierarchy, and I don't know what this framework would look like. It can't be described as 'male privilege', or even 'alpha privilege' because that's too simplistic and doesn't encapsulate the variability.  But before men can even develop a framework, they have to recognize the male-hierarchy as political in the first place. People of color recognize the racial hierarchy as political. Women  recognize the sex hierarchy as political. Generally men do not recognize the male-hierarchy as political. Some political analysis of the male-hierarchy has been done by gay theorists, but - and this is interesting - gay theory has largely been subsumed into postmodern queer theory, and hence it has become almost totally de-politicized."

As you say, it's about adaptation and not maximization, but frankly you are rare to understand the difference in such a way that impacts your analysis of human behavior.

Gender_Critical,38okua,Sojourner_Truth,-1,Sun Jun 7 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"I think this is also an important factor - the other reason why the low status men don't address the male-hierarchy is because they don't want to piss off the high status men. It's much easier for them to just direct their ire at women (ie, the whole MRA movement).   I do agree male hierarchy is not addressed enough - what specific things do you want such a theory to do?  I think they do talk about the male hierarchy a lot, male culture is based a lot on hierarchy and rising to the top. I would think that racism, classism and ableism plays a lot of role in this male hierarchy too but there is something that feels more fundamental about male hierarchy.  A lot of low status men likely simply feel too weak or helpless to take on and address the ""alpha"" males, not so much from not wanting to piss them off. So they blame the women.  I think the fact that redpillers or MRAs are doing this is also partially because women also enforce gender norms on men. It is a fact that both genders police gender for both women and men. (Women do call men pussies too. See also Tumblr SJWs equating being an ugly unmasculine loser to being a misogynist.) Nevertheless, they are wrong to blame women specifically, because it's the whole society that is oppressing them, not just women."
Gender_Critical,38okua,Sojourner_Truth,8,Sat Jun 6 01:05:28 2015 UTC,"Women don't enforce the male-hierarchy or rank men within it though. Men do that to each other. A woman might call a man a pussy (and men engage in this kind of policing far more often, and when they do it carries an implicit threat of violence), but men are the ones who defined what ""a pussy"" is, and which men fall under that category. At most, a woman can only reinforce, not enforce.    What specific things do you want such a theory to do?   I have no specific wants. This is men's business, after all. However, men currently don't have a coherent political framework which describes the construction of masculinity and the hierarchy between men which is based on how well they conform to masculinity. Such a framework would be useful for men, and would form the basis of a true ""men's rights"" movement. It would almost certainly provide some valuable insights for feminist theory too."

Male hierarchies arose by emergent historical and social contingencies, and men are socialized into the hierarchy, often by their male peers but also by women (e.g. mothers, sisters, female friends).   Elaborating on this, it's because male-female relations in our Western society are effectively a kind of symbiotic dynamic that puts the females in position that's very vulnerable in relation to males. There is a lot that women can't do within that dynamic -- defend themselves, acquire certain resources, etc -- and they are going to rely on males to pull their end of the bargain to live decent lives. Traditional femininity is reliant on traditional masculinity because it is restricted, so yeah, in that framework females are going to police males to fill their roles effectively."

I am questioning whether ""unlike a man, a woman is only reinforcing, not enforcing, male gender roles"".  For example, how is a guy bullying a nerd for his lack of masculinity different from a girl doing the same thing? After all, both the guy and the girl are invoking the nerd's failure of masculinity, his low status on the hierarchy.

They oscillate (as this type of feminism has to) between studies on the condition of women ("" ignoring"" that it didn't ask these women their identity, and doesn't 50% of the time on male exceptions, and thus failed at feminism 101) and ""everybody can be a woman, just do what feels good"".   EDIT: I won't listen to that episode. I don't need a talk on how women need to better accept and educate themselves on that topic. On how terrible it must be to live 50+ years as a man when really you know you've been a woman inside...

But it's the clothes people see first, so they are truly critical when it comes to passing.   The entire concept of 'passing' as a woman is antithetical to feminism. Simple as that.

Would the feminist reaction be to assure her that she, too, can be patriarchy-compliant in her appearance, and give her helpful pointers on how to display ritualized submission through appropriate amounts of frills and pink?

Is she sorting out how she feels about her own body as it starts to mature?    My mom did a pretty good job of giving it to me straight: Wearing make-up and pretty clothes will often get you nicer treatment because most people like compliant women more than non-compliant women.  On the other hand, ""girly"" is equated with silly, weak, and vapid, so the more ""girly"" you appear the less seriously you will be taken.  There is no way to win, because you are a female person.

One of the reasons some doctors (specifically) prefer the ""DSD"" term is that it takes away this assumption that the sex of the kid is completely mysterious or that they are somehow ""both sexes"" or some completely different ""category"" from ""regular people.""    Technology continually marches on, so now there's scans and genetics and everything else, usually they know exactly what happened along the path of sexual development to make the kid's development non-standard.   Lots of people on the internet like to constantly bring up the nebulous ""but intersex!"" in an attempt to claim that sex is not real, and that humans are not sexually dimorphic.

Gender_Critical,385r4q,flapyourwings,-8,Tue Jun 2 05:58:33 2015 UTC,"Serious question: do you care more when: a trans person undergoes HRT and obtains breasts slowly, or gets surgery instead? I'm not really sure why it matters. To me, it is no different than someone who had a mastectomy getting boob implants. ie: Someone, through no fault of their own, has no boobs and wants to have them in order to feel more feminine. I would judge these people less harshly than someone who had perfectly functioning breasts and wanted to ""upgrade them"" to gain attention from men."
Gender_Critical,385r4q,mrsgetlost,15,Tue Jun 2 06:03:53 2015 UTC,"I think women who get breast implants after mastectomies are doing reconstructive surgery. I know two women who have gotten mastectomies and neither opted to get reconstructive surgery. They often wear tank tops without bras and they are not ashamed of people being able to see that they don't have breasts. They are confident in their womanhood without breasts. (It's also very understandable if people get reconstructive surgery, too) There is no question that they are real women who won battles against breast cancer.   Trans people who get breast augmentations are giving so much weight to the size of breasts, as if breasts make a woman. It's sort of like how in video games, female characters are almost always depicted with very big breasts (despite being very thin; I know some thin women naturally have big breasts but it's not a common body type). Why are men so obsessed with turning women into walking breasts and ass? There's so much more to us than just human with boobs."
Gender_Critical,385r4q,liatris,11,Tue Jun 2 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"I think women who get breast implants after mastectomies are doing reconstructive surgery. I know two women who have gotten mastectomies and neither opted to get reconstructive surgery.   In France, it's kind of a non-saying but many women suffer more through reconstructive surgery than the breast cancer stuff itself. As in: they are really fed up of operations, complications, meds and shit and really don't want yet another invasive surgery, and the follow up surgery that are required 5-10 years down the road in ~50% of the cases. So there's external pressure to go through this, else much less women would do it."
Gender_Critical,385r4q,transsnarfleblort,10,Tue Jun 2 06:18:14 2015 UTC,That's exactly the reason why the women I know didn't bother with reconstructive surgery.
Gender_Critical,385r4q,liatris,-7,Tue Jun 2 06:35:12 2015 UTC,"Agree on most of your points. It's always an interesting discussion to think about at what point boobs or having womanly curves is something that just ""is"", something we subconsciously take in as part of our own gender identity, or maybe even take for granted, and at what point it's just a societal burden/obligation, with the pressures to either show them off/hide them/enlarge them/reduce them, etc.   I don't know what pressures to look a certain way a trans person feels, and how much of it is shallow traditional gender reinforcement, and how much is just that ""it feels right"". I do think, that unlike drag queens, trans people do often attempt to look as ""natural"" as possible. Whereas drag is really a (borderline offensive) caricature of women and femininity, trans women just want to be treated like any other woman, hence the emphasis on ""passing"". The photo of Caitlyn in the black lace top is definitely more obviously implants than the other photos I have seen. The cover of the magazine makes them look much more subtle.  For the record,  I know 2 MtF trans people, one who got implants and one who didn't and did just HRT. They are both happy with the results, and that's pretty much as far as my cares extend."

Couple this with his Vanity Fair cover image and it's clear that he's desperate to pose as a woman 30 years his junior.   Brucey also got himself a verified Twitter in his new name and his first post refers to himself in the third person. ""Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me.""

It just doesn't match. It makes you wonder, 'Why did this happen? How your mind can be totally different from what you were born as.' In middle school, I tried to adjust to what society wanted me to look like. Then, halfway through my freshman year in high school, I decided I was just going to be myself.""   What is this ""matching"" thing, other than purest unadulterated sexist expectations?  You have a brain, you have a body, they occurred in you, the individual, and are a valid combination just as they are. You exist, therefore they're a valid example of humanity. We are varied.  Whatever your brain is, however you think, it's a proper way to think for ""what you were born as."" Your thinking? It's a VALID PATTERN OF WOMAN'S THINKING. Because you define what people with your body can do, and NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.   How is this simple fact so hard for people to grasp?

Gender_Critical,3838gy,itazurakko,10,Mon Jun 1 15:56:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  This is about some incredibly extreme body/mind dualism taken so far and so seriously that people believe they must modify the flesh to satisfy the demands of the soul.  Whenever people build up these dualistic systems that see the body as somehow apart from the self, they're ignoring the development of human organisms, that the self is created through the interactions and stimuli mediated by the body.  And once you have an idea of a separate ""self,"" you can build up any crazy notions you want on it.  Medieval Christian theologists believed very much in this kind of dualism of the flesh and the spirit.  One could easily see them grappling with this very idea (indeed, if transgenderism had been common in the population over all time instead of being a culture bound syndrome created by sexualized images of women and the abuse of females)--that there could be female souls ""trapped"" in the flesh of men, and vice versa.  Once your ""soul"" is all that matters, the body becomes just a vessel for continued ""improvement"" of the soul, which so often seems to come in these dualistic systems at the expense of the body itself.  Priest-prescribed hair shirts and ""medically necessary"" electrolysis, the monk who flagellates himself nightly and the man who dilates his fistula, they all believe that through the mortification of the flesh they can bring their soul more into alignment with what is right and good."

Gender_Critical,37vyeq,deirdreofthegaians,11,Sat May 30 21:17:15 2015 UTC,"""For an overall picture of priorities in feminism today I did a quick analysis of 109 articles published in the online blog Everyday Feminism during a six week period from April 1st. Intersectional categories came out at Race: 26 articles; Class: 2; Lesbians get a paltry 1 article; Bi-sexual, Queer, Asexual and Intersex get 9 between them and Transgender gets a whole 15 posts to itself.  General categories include Violence at 10 posts, only 2 posts on Work, Parenting at 6; Sex: 9; Love: 6; Self-worth: 7 and Body: 18.  The difference in the balance and content of these articles is striking: articles on race examine and reference political campaigns, struggles and demonstrations in the public arena and are focused on action for change. Articles on trans people focus on their rights and include lists of rules for non-trans people. The articles for women, in contrast, are overwhelmingly focused on individual issues and personal change and transformation.  In case the message isn't clear, Everyday Feminism provides readers with a helpful pop-up advertisment for their 'Self Love course' which will enable you to 'free yourself from toxic self-talk and give yourself the love you deserve.' Women heal yourselves!  All women are disempowered and disenfranchised in this world, encouraged on the one hand to continually check privilege to avoid offending another group, and on the other, to view low self-worth as a matter of individual responsibility rather than as an issue of systemic oppression."""

Yes, I'm aware that that was slightly hyperbole (please dear god let it be hyperbole), but I'm really not surprised that those words where written by a modern trans advocate. This is clearly someone who isn't just in this for fetishistic reasons, totally. You can tell by the way they don't make everything about sexual intercourse... Er, hang on a minute...   so I was thinking this could get pretty slutty, pretty quickly, right?   I don't... why would... Who even describes random dudes propositioning them like this?! I can't even blame this on autogynephilia, because the word choice still makes no damn sense!   Well, apart from Rachel, poor thing, but then no one likes dandruff, babe.   Yes, let's take a moment to randomly insult one of your ""friends"" from college for happening to have dandruff; which, as I have just learned, affects about half of the population of the world!   usually followed by the classic, ""I've never been in this situation before.""   Maybe it's a ""classic"" because most people haven't actually wanted to have sex with someone who turned out to be trans? Like, you do realize how small a portion of the population identifies as trans right?   but I cannot forgive them for being so fucking predictable.   So you'd prefer that they have random reactions that have no basis in the laws of causality then?   most ended up taking a slice of Paris pie anyway   what.  You have a special euphemism for the act of having sex with you specifically? That's pretty damn weird. You should probably get checked by, well, someone. Not sure who could possibly help with that though.   Or maybe I'd wandered into a strange, parallel universe where being trans just really isn't a big deal any more?   Spoiler alert, being a lesbian is apparently still bad though. It'll come up shortly. Nice double standard dude.   Those questions are the same for anyone, but particularly more fraught for anyone from a minority background. No matter how smoking and wonderful you may be.   Maybe it's just because I don't get out much, but I'm fairly sure normal people don't go on about how ""smoking"" they look. Like, maybe they'd joke about it a bit if the subject came up, but they don't tend to mention it every few minutes like you are.  Also, here we see looks being used as a primary reason for a relationship, instead of actually liking the person. If someone wants to date a sex doll, they should do the world a favor and only proposition actual sex dolls. Please.   I guess straight guys [on Tinder] are more sexually open-minded than we often assume.   Spoken like someone who's never read /r/creepyPMs.  *shudder*   The following is a report on what I've learned about using dating apps as a proud transgender seductress.   I'm just pointing this out to help demonstrate how often ""Paris"" (amusingly, ""Paris"" was a man's name in Greek Mythology, and I don't think I've ever heard of anyone else with the same name) mentions how good he apparently looks. It's pretty frequent.   Basically, my pool of hotties may be biased towards a more open-minded metropolitan elite.   You had a decent (though really poorly worded) point right up until you said ""elite"". Your taste is not ""better"" or ""worse"" than someone else's (well, it's probably worse, but let's not get into that just now). Taste is subjective. Saying that the people you are into are ""elite"" just adds to the perception that you have an absolutely massively over-sized ego.  Self esteem is very different than telling everyone how awesome you are.   The cotton version is when people who otherwise support trans rights say they wouldn't have sex with a trans person.   Ahahahahahahaha! No.  It's about lesbians who don't want to have sex with dudes. The ones who do, well they're not lesbians, by definition. I thought we were past this with the whole ""gay acceptance"" thing. Clearly I'm stuck in the past with my thinking that women (adult female humans, for those not in the know) should be able to decide if they want to have sex with someone, and shouldn't be harassed or ridiculed for not wanting to have sex with any particular person.   after all, it's up to you who you want to fuck—but you don't need to be a dick about your preference. Or, you know, limit yourself.   First bit: Great, fine, neato. Second bit: Aha! Here we get to the part where you look down on lesbians from your obviously enlightened and superior position. Some people are not into penises, that's totally fine. And furthermore, it's a completely understandable position when so many people who have penises are absolute jack-asses all the time! Where the fuck did your self awareness go?! Did you ever have any to begin with?!   I don't want to embarrass anyone (read: I don't want to jeopardize potential shags/hot dates/marriages)   By all that is unholy why do you persist in making everything about having sex!? There are other things to life besides orgasms, now for the love of sanity go do some of them!   Fuck me now, Freddy!   Good news, we've finally got proof that there is a god! Bad news, he apparently really hates me. Fuck you too, asshole!  *wanders off while grumbling incoherently*   Whether they just didn't read my info when they swiped right   Yeah, they didn't read it. Seriously, go read /r/creepyPMs sometime. It'll really open your eyes dude.   Guys are ON IT   Which you would already know if you had even the slightest idea what actual women face in life. Way too many dudes will fuck anything that moves, and a lot of things that don't. As long as they aren't on the receiving end, they usually don't give a fuck.   but the point is, I'm still popular! Probably more popular than you.   Huh? This is completely out of left field. Like, who is this dig even aimed at?   I spent my first night on Tinder speaking to two other journalists, both fans of mine, of course.   We get it, you're the most awesomest and specialest and prettiest person on the planet. Can I leave now, please?   I mean, who knew? Tinder has legitimate human beings on it whom you can talk to about actual stuff.   And a metric fuckton more who are happy to shag anything that's vaguely warm and flexible. And the temperature part is negotiable.    Edit: Got rid of superfluous ""apparently""."

Gender_Critical,37n986,deadpolice,14,Fri May 29 12:16:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  For Paris and other MTFs, catcalls and wolf whistles are something you only get when you actually dress up as a woman, deliberately, at an age when you're aware that women are catcalled and what that means, an age where you already understand your sexuality on some level.  For women, catcalls begin in early adolescence and are totally non-contingent on doing your hair, wearing makeup, heels, etc..  They happen because you're walking down the street with a vagina.  It's not sweet sweet validation of our gendah identity when it happens, either, though one would think it ought to be if we were ""cis"" and therefore content with the female sex role.  It's frightening and decidedly NOT a compliment.  I think there's a huge difference, see, MTFs only get catcalls when they're doing their utmost to ""dress.""  When they look merely androgynous, they're more likely to get jeers.  Whereas actual women know that men will wolf whistle at you and catcall you while you're in sweats with no makeup looking shitty, just because they can.  They'll do it to women who are distinctly unattractive.  But they only do it to the most attractive MTFs.  That's why it's happy fun validation hour for them, and an ugly reminder of patriarchy for us."

She uses that word repeatedly to describe her attitude towards Andy’s assaults: normal.  “I felt trapped, like everyone thought it was normal and I had to go along with it if I wanted to be accepted.” The pressure to conform to these perceived expectations was so great that, eventually, Rhea says, “I felt like there was no way out.” She tried to kill herself."""

Is she trying to say that, say, an effeminate boy is somehow not really a boy?  That being a girl is liking dresses, and any boy with that preference is truly a girl?  I suppose when you put it that way, it all sounds terribly sexist."

Ask black children which doll they want to play with and they pick a white one--and many black children want white-looking skin.  That's not because they feel innately white or have white brains.  It's because they're absorbing messages that come in from all around them."

They notice relationship dynamics, and learn what is their and other's position in them.   But obviously, since a kid is almost only within a family circle, they'll get their understanding of the world through it : if the girl is treated like her brothers, for her it will be like the entire world is so. The kind of games, media, tv shows they are exposed to or kept from (and the reasons they receive) will also help make sense of the world."

For decades magazines, fashion shows, and other adverts have pushed females of all ages toward being hypersexual, hyperfeminine, super skinny (weak and easily conquered) objects for male use. Millions of young girls develop their first sense of their own body image around the images they see of girls in advertising, and the result of that is that 53% of 13-year old girls, 78% of 17-year-old girls, and 91% of women report being unhappy with their bodies. 40% of 9 and 10 year old girls have attempted weight loss. 95% of people (both female and male) are 12 to 25 years old. Adverts showing this one ideal of what a woman is have created a crisis throughout the modern world, and these are adverts that depict real women (read: biological, real females). The bodies in these adverts, until very recently, have been those of real females, thought with too much photoshop action. So what the hell is going to happen now that male bodies are being presented as a feminine ideal?   What a complete mind fuckery this must be to young girls, teens, and impressionable women. How many girls now are going to suddenly trans it up to get the male features they're being pushed to believe they should have?   I'll be writing to IMG about this. I know I'll be ignored or worse receive some sickening response like ""at IMG we value self-identified women of all types and honour them by adopting them into our Models family and showing them off in our fashion advertising. As long as they identify as women and live culturally as women then their cocks, balls, or inverted cocks matter not to us. They're women just like you!""   I really wish that fake reply I wrote from IMG was so far out of possibility that I could laugh right now at it, but then I read from the Girl Scouts (USA) the following and I realise that my fake reply from IMG is probably not far off what they'd actually say:  ""Girl Scouts has valued and supported all girls since our inception in 1912. There is not one type of girl. Every girl's sense of self, path to it, and how she is supported is unique...If a girl is recognized by her family, school and community as a girl and lives culturally as a girl, Girl Scouts is an organization that can serve her in a setting that is both emotionally and physically safe.  Inclusion of transgender girls is handled at a council level on a case by case basis, with the welfare and best interests of all members as a top priority."" VOMIT"

Most people who identify as asexual (especially demisexuals) I think have normal sexualities and just became alienated by hypersexuality in the media being presented as the only correct, liberated sexuality. There is evidence that after the sexual revolution in the '60s/'70s, there was an increase in people complaining to their doctors about low libido, many of whom were probably on the normal scale and just suddenly felt ashamed about it.

So it's not incorrect to suggest that bullying played a role for this person, but I am in no place to judge how much of a role it played.    The son who made her whole first sank into depression about two years ago. “He started cutting himself,” said Prescott.   That alone is a warning sign, and it obviously isn't the death of her pets that caused the suicide.  One doesn't have to refuse to accept that school bullying caused the suicide, it's not like accepting that invalidates our points about gender being an oppressive construct.

I'm distinctly uncomfortable with utilizing the death of this child to make any kind of point, it just feels wrong and is unnecessary.

All I'm asking is why the news media didn't report ""teenager kills self after pets die.""  It would have been equally accurate (and equally not descriptive of the full scenario of this child's life).

Just look at what happened with Leelah/Josh Alcorn. 'See?? If you had just listened to us and did as we say then kids wouldn't be killing themselves :)' It's the trans community that's filled with a bunch of sick fucks encouraging depressed kids to do drastic shit all in the name of transgender without any regard for their mental well-being.  I've read so many askt threads where people talk about how their depression 'disappeared' after taking hormones, which is highly unbelievable and gives a false impression that transitioning is a fix to your problems. That attitude does not help kids who seek transition as a cure instead of seeking help with depression/other problems but find themselves feeling just as awful as before.  I've seen so many askt threads where confused kids are told that if they don't transition ASAP then they'll end up dead and the whole trans community treats suicide as some sort of inevitable outcome. You think that helps them?   This isn't a stupid point against trans people, this is a legitimate fucking problem in your dumbass, shitty community.

And as people may or may not have noticed, the situation is being echoed in the US.  More and more states are legalizing gay marriage, as well as making it easier for trans people to change their name & sex on their driver's license -- in NYC you merely require 'an identity', rather than any surgery of any kind, and in other states, a boob job or FFS counts as surgery enough to change your sex.  Meanwhile we have been getting harsher and more fucked up abortion laws for the past five years.  More states  are shutting down abortion clinics.  George Tiller was assassinated at his own clinic in Kansas.  More places, particularly for rural areas that affect disadvantaged and often marginalized (more often black and indian) women, are making it so they have to wait '72' hours, which can make it quite impossible to even take the time to go get an abortion, if the car drive requires you to go so far away that you have to stay in a hotel in order to see the doctor.  It's getting more and more expensive.  It's getting worse.  As Murphy says again and again, I'm glad that gay men and lesbians will have the ability to get married and share in the laws that they are  afforded, but women's rights are shrinking while laws that benefit men continue to grow."

You shouldn't be penalised for opting out of such an archaic system.  Still, I'd love for gay marriage to be legalised here (Aus) but that will only be if the Liberals (Conservative party) allow their members to have a conscience vote instead of voting as a block.  If I think about my reasons for wanting to get married, it has to do with really wanting to appear ""normal"". It's stupid and illogical and I won't bore anyone with the nitty gritty aspects.

Gender_Critical,378738,deirdreofthegaians,7,Mon May 25 17:54:01 2015 UTC,"This is both presumptuous and historically dishonest.  Number one, people in the 18th and 19th centuries did not think like this  They might have wished to have been the other sex or thought life would be easier as a member of the other sex, but they most certainly did not believe that they actually WERE the other sex in the wrong body.  Such a notion would have been utterly foreign and absurd to them (as it truly is).  It dishonors the memories of these women to slap the trans label on them without their permission.  Secondly, and most importantly, you can't compare past societies with today's society. Posing as a member of the other sex had a completely different motivation than doing so today would. Unlike today, where women can openly aspire to do anything they wish to do, openly as women, pre-20th century women who wished to do things limited to men in her society without interference had to disguise themselves as men, go by a male name, and consistently refer to herself as ""he"".    Attempting to do so openly as a woman would invite a range of possible consequences:  a. being ridiculed  b. being shunned by one's family, society, or both  c. being locked up in an insane asylum  d. being imprisoned  e. being subject to violence   f. and, of course, not getting to do the things she wanted to do.  It's also significant to note that nearly all the ones who posed as members of the other sex were women posing as men.  Today, the vast majority of transfolk are men posing as women.  And the women in history were not deluded - they didn't think they actucally WERE men. Some, like Deborah Sampson, who fought in the Revolutionary War, reverted to female garb after the war, got married, and raised a family.  She also made money giving talks about her army experiences and performed drill for her audiences. She petitioned for and received a military pension, despite the government knowing she was female by that time and, after her death, her husband was the first male military spouse to get a survivor's pension.  Some time ago, I did manage to get her name taken off the trans list on Wikipedia."

Here is a picture of a BC birth certificate. You will notice there is no 'gender marker', but the individual's sex is specified. For a group that differentiates between gender and sex, trans* advocates really need to be consistent and say gender when they mean gender, and sex when they mean sex.   I tried to google around to see if intersex people are given a third sex category on government documents, and the only relevant source I found was this document from 2014, from the British Columbia Law Institute that states:   In Canada, Ontario is the only province which has adopted the third sex of “undetermined” for intersex persons.   So I'm not saying the current M/F sex format is acceptable or meets the needs of intersex people, but to propose removal of the individual's sex on the birth cerificate because some people are intersex it is silly to me, unless the reason sex was included on birth certificates in the first place is no longer relevant. Once again it seems like trans* advocates are using intersex people as a sort of shield.  The article goes on to say:   ""Your sex is not determined or reflected in your physiology 100% of the time.""   ...I don't even know what to say to this but I have a feeling he's about to say he has a ladybrain and his sex is therefore female. I wish he'd understand physical world isn't a lie because it doesn't match this feelings.  Morgane Oger also left a comment (which I am quoting part of), saying:   Many people don't realize their ideas about their sex were debunked decades ago.  Remember when we had race on birth certificates? Earlier, we also had class.   If you believe humans are a sexually dimorphic species, you're racist AND classist!

Gender_Critical,374nwx,liatris,14,Sun May 24 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"I found the article interesting due to the obvious overlap with the language people use concerning gender-identity disorder AND because this was published so far back it's not nearly as politically correct about the topic as something published in The Atlantic today would be.    Yet what exactly does it mean to be stuck in the wrong body? For the past several years I have been working with a research group interested in problems surrounding the use of medical interventions for personal enhancement. One of the issues we have struggled with is how to understand people who use the language of self and identity to explain why they want these interventions: a man who says he is ""not himself"" unless he is on Prozac; a woman who gets breast-reduction surgery because she is ""not the large-breasted type""; a bodybuilder who says he took anabolic steroids because he wants to look on the outside the way he feels on the inside; and—perhaps most common—transsexuals whose experience is described as ""being trapped in the wrong body."" The image is striking, and more than a little odd. In each case the true self is the one produced by medical science.  At first I was inclined to think of this language as a literal description. Maybe some people really did feel as if they had found their true selves on Prozac. Maybe they really did feel incomplete without cosmetic surgery. Later on, however, I came to think of the descriptions less as literal than as expressions of an ambivalent moral ideal—a struggle between the impulse toward self-improvement and the impulse to be true to oneself. Not that I can see no difference between a middle-aged man rubbing Rogaine on his head every morning and a man whose discomfort in his own body is so all-consuming that he begins to think of suicide. But we shouldn't be surprised when any of these people, healthy or sick, use phrases like ""becoming myself"" and ""I was incomplete"" and ""the way I really am"" to describe what they feel, because the language of identity and selfhood surrounds us. It is built into our morality, our literature, our political philosophy, our therapeutic sensibility, even our popular culture. This is the way we talk now. This is the way we think. This is even the way we sell cars and tennis shoes. We talk of self-discovery, self-realization, self-expression, self-actualization, self-invention, self-knowledge, self-betrayal, and self-absorption. It should be no great revelation that the vocabulary of the self feels like a natural way to describe our longings, our obsessions, and our psychopathologies."

Realistically, it's hypocritical as increasingly I'm seeing it baldly stated any male that says they are a woman/any female that states they are a man is that sex and always were so they should be applying to co-ed or schools for males instead of using their sex when it suits and claimed identity when it suits.   Notably, even my strong google skills show up nothing for women identifying as men trying to break into male colleges, it's only the very few for women that are being targeted. I think being safe is part of it, they know full well that identity doesn't mean much in regards to the all pervasive violence against women in society, the part may be embedded in why females feel the need to identify as a man - that being to escape the shitty deal they get in life that no woman escapes.   Anecdote of mine - I went to school for a while with a boy who was fa'afafine. One other kid said it was because his mum had too many boys, and needed a girl to help out and he was the one (LOL, never quite believed that!). It wasn't an issue at all, his mum sent him there in boy's school uniform and he used the correct facilities for his sex. Socially it was different, but they still recognised him as male despite falling into that category. It's an interesting comparison looking at the differences in how this was treated way back when, and how this is pushed now, with identity trumping all (except when it suits them not to use it).   I'm not sure about athletics, once again if stating you are male, you should be enrolling in male sports. After all, we keep on being told there is no real difference between women and males that identify as women in sports. Instead it's just quietly avoided, I'd think because again they know identity won't trump biology and they'd never run as fast or have the strength and stamina of a male and would mostly not even be able to knock on the door of men's sports."

Gender_Critical,36vwer,wanderingwomb,2,Sat May 23 16:59:57 2015 UTC,"Basically.  Most of the stuff I'm reading that complains about it   For a while there's been this narrative that M2T will be beat up and possibly killed if they use the men's bathroom. (Heck, we should restrict this to ""non-passing M2T"" really, since passing stealth M2T can use the women's without anyone really noticing, so they are not the ones usually involved in ""bathroom drama."")  Because they will possibly be killed in the men's, they must (flying leap of logic here!) be allowed into the women's, as a SAFETY MEASURE.    But that whole line of argument relies on there being only two choices of bathroom - men's and women's.    The unisex bathrooms remove all the ammunition behind the argument for using the women's. With a unisex bathroom (particularly a one-holer, which is in fact the form that unisex bathrooms are taking in the US, often called ""family bathrooms"") there is no need for the M2T to use the women's to escape assault and murder, because they can go into the locked bathroom all by themselves.  And so there are already legal cases that have been solved by giving access to such a unisex bathroom. You can't use the men's? Okay, we'll put in a ""family bathroom"" since that's the trend in 2015 for all sorts of reasons and the customers love it too.  But there are also people who are refusing to use the unisex on offer. They are insisting on using the women's, specifically. Usually it's about ""not wanting to be singled out for being trans."" (As if only trans use this bathroom - no one is going to know that behind the scenes you were told to only use this one.) They are saying, ""You have to let me use the women's with 'all the other women'"" etc.  Which goes to show, for that subset, yeah, it's all about the validation of being allowed to use the women's room, to be told by some outsiders that yes, we count you as women. Being seen coming out of the women's is just like extra push for the ""see? I use the women's room, I must be a woman"" to outside observers who might be doubting.  Interesting thing, a lot of ""who gets to use the women's"" is based on legal gender marker on ID. So if someone has SRS, most places they can change their ID and so if challenged, they'd have the coveted ""F"" on there.  Some places you don't need SRS, just a doctor's letter.   But a lot of the cases that make the news, the person is challenged (often by a boss, who has gotten complaints from female coworkers or customers about the M2T in the bathroom) and asked to show ID. The M2T is incensed about being asked (some of them will go on and on about ""how could anyone possibly know what's in my pants if I didn't show them? They don't ask 'other women'"" etc with complete obliviousness) and will resist showing the ID.    Then the ID comes out, and... yep, it says ""M."" If it really did say ""F,"" even if the person doesn't pass in a million years, the argument would end up differently (because the legal system does have to draw arbitrary lines) but usually in the big news stories, it's ""M"" which is why they're fighting.  Some people go back to the ""safety"" argument and insist that if they're ""on the bubble"" of passing and are seen using the one-holer, people will suddenly KNOW they're trans, and thus stalk them and kill them in a hate crime. Others just stick with the ""it's like Jim Crow to tell trans people specifically that they have to use a gender-neutral bathroom"" (which... not quite, they can always use the men's.)  This ""gender neutral bathroom is not enough"" thing is coming up in a lot of the kid trans at school stories too. People are saying that a gender-neutral bathroom (as many new schools now have) or using the staff or nurse bathroom (as a lot of older schools tried to settle) isn't good enough, the parents are insisting that it's extremely important for the M2T kid to use the bathroom with the girls, because it's a social thing and they don't want their kid left out.  So yeah... transphobic, because it's providing a solution other than the desired ""let the M2T use the women's."""

The authors do give those two hypotheticals but the article is about choosing to transition your child or helping them accept their sex, and they condemn President Obama for attacking conversion therapy for such children when 80% desist in their dysphoria if left alone.  It's a message most posters here would agree with.  That said, I don't understand why co-author J. Michael Bailey would leave an important piece out of this puzzle.  In his book The Man Who Would Be Queen, he explains that most of these boys will grow up to be gay, and that there seems to be no innate difference between gay men and homosexual transsexuals.  It seems to me that gender confusion is just a natural part of being the type of boy who will grow up to be gay, and that when parents chose to transition their child they are simply extending that confusion into adulthood."

Gender_Critical,36qrsl,deirdreofthegaians,18,Thu May 21 11:25:38 2015 UTC,"I want to clear up a couple of misconceptions about circumgender trans women before a bunch of misinformation gets posted in here.  Some people might ask why I have posted so many things that view trans women in a negative light, or have misgendered them.  But after so many years of erasure and denial from transgender activists, it's natural for a lot of circumgender people to feel a bit of hostility from the community that is refusing to accept them as one of their own.  When you see a circumgender trans person blowing off steam toward a ciscumgender trans person (i.e. some of those famous images of circumgender women holding up signs or emblazoned with tattoos reading ""die ciscumgender trans scum""), keep in mind that the circumgender trans woman isn't the privileged person here, the ciscumgender trans person is.  Additionally, it has come to my attention that CERTs (Circumgender Exclusionary Radical Transactivists) object to the use of the term ""ciscumgender"" in the circumgender community.  But to just refer to this privileged class of trans people as ""non-circumgender"" is to refuse to acknowledge their relative level of privilege and to make circumgender forever seem like the outcast, the outlier.  We have a right to define ourselves and our terms, and to decide what the terms we can use to define our oppressors are.  People who want to deny circumgender trans women the right to use the term ""ciscumgender trans woman"" are contributing to the same oppression and erasure we've experienced for years."

Gender_Critical,36qrsl,generibus,15,Thu May 21 12:25:57 2015 UTC,"Hey, I was the one who decided to do an AMA, no offense taken.  Though again, these questions wouldn't be appropriate for someone you just met if the context was any different.  It's true that there are differences between my story and the story of the ""typical"" trans woman.  But I think it's critical to remember that not all trans women have the same story.  Some transitioners start transition early, some start late.  Some start AFAB and end up women and some start AMAB and end up women.  Since there's no one ""true trans"" narrative, to say that my narrative is less valid is inherently circumphobic and transphobic, as well as narrow minded.  I know you didn't ask this question to be offensive and I'm trying not to be triggered by it, but I will say it still gave me a pang of hurt.  See, there are so many ways in which I've been treated exactly like a trans woman.  When I wanted to dress more ""girly"" or do more feminine things as a child, I was kept from doing them.  I was forced to keep my hair short.  I was steered away from forming friendships with girls.  Not even all the ciscumgender trans women I've met experienced that level of transphobia.  My socialization may seem different from some ciscumgender trans women, but I assure you it is very similar to that of others.  For anything you could say about my childhood, you could certainly find trans women who had experienced that same thing, except aspects relating to AMAB biology, which again are not important unless we're biological determinists."

Gender_Critical,36qrsl,Sojourner_Truth,8,Thu May 21 17:56:41 2015 UTC,When did you first realize that you are circumgender?
Gender_Critical,36qrsl,pleuvoir,13,Thu May 21 11:26:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this took me a long time.  I guess my first hint was that as a child, I always loved watching drag queens.  It wasn't the fact that they were MEN that I loved.  It was their incredibly sparkly, shiny, over-the-top style, the way they could rock a sequined dress on a Wednesday night.  What I really wanted was to be a woman who was that over-the-top.  But I felt like it could never happen, like I'd never have access to that kind of gender performance.  My mother tended to force me into hand-me-downs and whatever fit from the ""husky girls"" section of the JCPenney clearance rack, which usually meant androgynous clothing, nothing fashionable.  I longed to wear something with frills, and I wanted my mother to think I was worth spending clothing money on.  Because I was not a pretty enough daughter for a woman who'd spent her life in pageants, my clothing was cheaper and more plain than it had to be.  She also forbade me from long hair, saying I couldn't take care of it properly.  It was cut the shortest it's ever been as a punishment one day, as part of an abusive tear she was on.  Even though I was decidedly AFAB, many people mistook me for male or derided my high level of androgyny as a preteen and teenager.  I pressed the halves of my chest together, hoping the tissue would shape itself into gorgeous cleavage, but nothing was forthcoming.  It took me until my early twenties to re-explore my ""feminine"" side.  A single dress, purchased on ebay furtively.  I checked myself in the mirror dozens of times with it on privately, wore it and a few other dresses inside the house first.  It felt right...but different...and I thought somehow that when people saw me in a dress, they'd laugh at me or mock me.  It was a deep feeling, that expressing femininity would lead to derision and hatred.  After I wore a dress out and people reacted with a mix of positivity and negativity, I started wearing dresses more frequently, then all the time.  I started growing my hair very long, longer than I'd ever worn it before.  And something crazy happened: I started feeling better.  I was doing things I'd wanted to do with my own aesthetic that I'd been feeling since I was young.  Oddly, the cleavage I'd been hoping for started developing around that time as well.  Today, I'd say I have the breasts I wished I had when I was fifteen, even though I wear the same size.  I read about circumgender one day and it all fell into place.  I'd undergone a ""transition"" of sorts to presenting as female.  My shoes were size 12s, and I'd been told by sneering shoe store employees before to go shop with the ""t-words"" (he didn't say t-words, he said the slur I do not want to say here).  All my identifications as a kid suddenly seemed relevant again.  I realized that one of the problems I was having is that unlike most other trans women, my transition was invisible to most people.  Other trans women can expect to be acknowledged as trans, to have an aspect of themselves that I think is so important highlighted repeatedly.  My transness is totally invisible to anyone except the people I'm closest to, and the people who saw me through my time of transition.  I never learned to wear makeup, for instance, but no one in my twenties ever taught me how like many of the trans women I know were taught by their cisgender friends.  I guess I fully accepted the idea that I'm a trans woman after I realized that the only person preventing that identity from being true was myself, by not acknowledging what I knew deep down.  I don't know how to articulate that I know I should be a trans woman, I just do."
Gender_Critical,36qrsl,pleuvoir,13,Thu May 21 11:41:49 2015 UTC,"I should remind everyone that there is no one right way to be circum.  Ciscum trans women like to talk about how circum women are pretending if they didn't have a long history of identifying as transgender, but because of deeply internalized circumphobia, many circum trans people simply don't understand the feelings they're experiencing or have any way of contextualizing them until significantly later.  In some ways I was very lucky to have my feelings happen very early, because I'm less likely to have them invalidated by ciscum CERTs."

Lo and behold, when I found the community of trans women I found that my sisters had been doing things the same way for years.  I also found that many of them, like me, felt a sense of discomfort and unease in men's restrooms, especially when they were filled with men.  Today I only go into the ladies' room, actually, because I'm more cognizant of the kinds of issues trans women can encounter if they enter a men's bathroom.  Now that I'm presenting in dresses full time, the men's room seems like an even more dangerous place to me."

Gender_Critical,36qrsl,LovingLilith,11,Thu May 21 13:49:39 2015 UTC,"First of all, it's important to stop making assumptions about trans women.  Assuming things about what genitals someone was born with because they consider themselves trans is really bad form.  You can also make sure that circumgender women are centered at trans events.  The violence suffered by ciscumgender trans women is often put at the front and center of violence against transgender people movements, to the detriment of circumgender people.  You can also help by increasing visibility and not questioning a circumgender person's identity.  Regardless of what you feel about someone's gender, their internal feelings are theirs to categorize as they wish.  Also, I know you're not trying to use outdated or offensive terminology, but ""circumtrans"" is not the preferred nomenclature because it collapses several aspects of circumgender into a single term.  It's important for ciscumgender trans women to keep up with the terminology changes occurring as circumgender trans women find their footing in the trans movement."

Gender_Critical,36qrsl,WhyNotEatCats,5,Thu May 21 15:51:42 2015 UTC,How would you define 'trans woman'? What does it feel like to be one?
Gender_Critical,36qrsl,transsnarfleblort,21,Thu May 21 11:27:48 2015 UTC,"A trans woman is anyone who feels like they've transitioned in any way to womanhood!  The term is open to anyone who chooses to self-identify as a trans woman.  The fact that I don't have a ""typical"" history of transition doesn't mean I shouldn't have access to, for instance, electrolysis for my chin hair, which causes me significant distress.  To be a trans woman is to feel like in your life you've undergone significant changes to how you present your own femininity and what it means for you to be a woman.  This change doesn't have to be surgery, hormones, et cetera.  A trans woman doesn't need to have been born with a penis, and to say otherwise is the kind of biological determinism I really thought we'd gotten past as feminists.  I should note that while I'm okay with people asking anything here, you really shouldn't ask any random circumgender trans person you meet these kinds of questions.  My answer may not be the same as another circumgender trans person's, we're not a monolith or a unified whole.  It is no one's responsibility to justify their trans identity to you, ESPECIALLY if you are not circumgender yourself.  Remember: if someone says they're circumgender and trans, they are.  You don't get to dictate anyone else's identity."

Can we talk for a minute about how problematic the whole idea of trans women trying to ""pass"" is?  Some of us are so invisible that our status is hardly ever recognized, even by the people close to us.  And keep in mind that due to the tremendous stigma and how most cis and trans people alike don't even believe we exist, the vast majority of circumgender people have never come out at all.  It's incredibly lonely.  To hear a trans woman talk about how happy she is that no one slipped up and called her ""he,"" or that no one even gave her a second glance in a dress, I get so upset.  It's massively triggering to hear someone say that this thing they're aspiring to--appearing for all purposes like you have the biohistory of a cis woman--is actually something that has caused you so much pain and difficulty."

Gender_Critical,36qrsl,BetAle,8,Thu May 21 12:49:13 2015 UTC,"When I was younger, I had significantly elevated levels of testosterone, leading to a lot of excess hair growth and such.  In my twenties, these symptoms eased for unknown reasons--another reason my trans identity started making sense to me when I realized I might be circumgender.  I haven't taken any hormones specifically prescribed for my circum issues, or had any surgery to take out my cervix and uterus so I will be more like what most people's vision of a true trans woman is, but that doesn't invalidate my identity one iota.  A lot of doctors are still really confused about circumgender patients.  They don't understand why I might not want certain body parts touched, or why I might not want a ciscumgender trans doctor.  I'm doing my best to educate my own doctor but he seems to think circumgender is the same thing as cisgender, which is clearly circumphobic.  Circumgender people who wish to be given hormones should be given them.  While AFAB circumgender trans women will lose their ability to carry a healthy pregnancy to term if they take anti-androgens (this is why, for instance, the anti-baldness pill Propecia can't be touched by pregnant or trying-to-conceive AFAB people), these pills should be dispensed on demand to anyone who feels their endocrine system runs better on even less testosterone than they already produce."

Truth is they'll never know what it feels like to be constantly questioning their own sanity. They promote the most unhealthy conception of transwomen as perverts and disingenuous operators.  In the end a vagina will never be a penis which is already a vagina but could be more vagina-y with some surgery. It also has full functionality which seems wrong to me. It promotes sexual reproduction which is basically rape, I mean PIV is always rape. It's literally a hole for men to put seed in to potentially create more men. Talk about some MRA's amirite? Cloning a super race of all women who are womales through the transitive property of internet shit talk and somatic cell nuclear transfer will fix all that right up.  I mean, I wish I didn't have to pretend to be nice to these people. Don't they know that us transwomen have to break our conditioning to be assholes in order to protect our fragile manhoods? They take our common courtesy for granted and think we actually accept them as transwomen when really we're just tolerating them because they're so sad and broken.  Speaking of sad and broken, did you see that article about a mentally ill lesbian the other day? Hilarious, I have a tear in my eye!"

He is so clearly seeing his friends transitioning for what it is, a social phenomenon, and his parents are telling him to pretend it's something else.   Gender is like a fingerprint; no two people’s genders are exactly the same. Everyone’s gender is unique and awesome.   They don't think he goes to school and sees this is a crock of shit?  He sees reality: he sees ""boys are this way and girls are this way.""   We always knew that — statistically speaking — our children could be trans   I wonder if they also knew that, statistically speaking, their children would almost certainly be gay?  Well, perhaps not gay if their parents had anything to do with it, but certainly homosexual.  Imagine for a moment they were calling him a ""gay kid,"" setting up playdates with other boys like him, talking about how he's going to date boys and taking him to pride parades.

So she then goes on to tell the boy that he's definitely not straight, and that he's most likely bisexual or pansexual, even though the boy has expressed no desire in the same sex. The poor boy just sounded so confused and thought ""pansexual"" was a type of pancake (he's only 11 after all).   The thing about these ""gender parents"" is that they're so wrapped up in their narcissistic belief that they are so ""brave"" for raising a transboy or transgirl, that they need to push keep pushing their kids (sometimes against their will) down the trans path for their own personal validation. You could see it in the mother's disappointment after learning that her son might only be a mere hetero.

Gender_Critical,36r144,thrownawaywaywayoff,17,Thu May 21 13:06:34 2015 UTC,"I think a helpful word to sink your teeth into is the concept of ""legitimacy.""  Whether a person identifies as transgender, ""non-binary,"" or even cisgender, they're giving legitimacy to a harmful, socially constructed system, because in declaring that their ""innate gender"" matches or does not match their body, they're declaring the existence of an innate gender.  Here is a relevant essay that expands upon another point to be made, which is that non-binary serves to reinforce and narrowly define the gender categories. It doesn't expand or weaken the sex/gender system, it makes it stronger by making the ends of the gender spectrum less ambiguous. A man who calls himself non-binary because he enjoys ballet and soft fabric and long-flowy clothes is making the declaration that men are people who don't like these things.  The category of ""non-binary"" or genderqueer, or genderfluid, or bigender, requires, for its existence, a binary on which to compare itself against. It requires the existence of endpoints in order to locate itself on the spectrum. In order to be genderqueer, there must be some social construct that a person is queer from. Males and females must have a series of social stereotypes attached to them so that a person can define themselves away from it. There has to exist a set of social stereotypes attached to the male sex that a male (sex) person can compare himself to in order to say ""no, I'm not like that.""  If being male or female didn't have any attached social meaning (this is what feminists want), there would be nothing to queer away from. You wouldn't be ""non-binary,"" because there would be no binary, there would just be people, and about half of them would have penises and half would have vaginas and about 15% would be left-handed and 85% would be right-handed and some odd percent would have dark skin and some odd person would have light skin and so on."
Gender_Critical,36r144,veronalady,3,Thu May 21 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"This is a brilliantly succinct way of putting it.  Thanks, VL!"
Gender_Critical,36r144,deirdreofthegaians,0,Thu May 21 23:33:01 2015 UTC,"This makes sense to me.  But doesn't this mean that identifying as 'queer' poses the same problem?  i.e. queers are the queer ones, and heterosexuality is the normal they're queering from.  In reality, it seems like pure heterosexuality is as much of an outlier as pure homosexuality.  So wouldn't queer-identification reinforce the social construct of heteronormativity?"
Gender_Critical,36r144,femininist,5,Thu May 21 20:56:01 2015 UTC,"In reality, it seems like pure heterosexuality is as much of an outlier as pure homosexuality.   Homosexuals have sex with people of the same sex. Heterosexuals have sex with people of the other sex. You are, of course, welcome to fret about the abstract notion of ""pure homosexuality"" and ""pure heterosexuality"" and what it means for your special identity, but hint: it's tedious and irrelevant outside of your queer theory classes. Why not ask your question there?  ETA: mind continually blown by people who think that coming out as gay or lesbian is primarily about promoting your personal brand and showing others how special/transgressive you are. BARF."
Gender_Critical,36r144,BeeeboBrinker,2,Thu May 21 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"Just because both use the term 'queer' does not mean they are the same thing.  Sex is (roughly) binary. Half the world is male, and half the world is female.  Heterosexuality, not so much. An overwhelming majority of people are straight, at least in practice. Homosexuality is queer because it's different from the majority. Being 'genderqueer' does not actually describe being different. It's just a way of defining yourself that reinforces the gender binary. Genderqueer people are still male and female.  As for the merits of seeing homosexuality as something different, I agree with you that in a long term it's problematic. Right now, it's imperative for LGB people to be able to define and defend ourselves since we are an oppressed minority, but I would love to see a future where love is equal."
Gender_Critical,36r144,Astraloid,3,Fri May 22 02:11:59 2015 UTC,"I think identifying as ""queer"" DOES pose the same problem somewhat, but that's because for a while now ""queer"" has not meant the same thing as ""homosexual"" or even just ""non-heterosexual"" at all.  If you look at how many people are rushing to insist that they belong under the ""queer"" umbrella (including plenty of heterosexual people!!) it becomes clear that ""queer"" has morphed into a sort of ""hip, not square, unique, quirky, cool"" label. I mean, you have people insisting that they're ""queer"" just because they're into kink or otherwise just sexually exhibitionist, they rush to explain that they're not ""vanilla."" This even if 100% of the sex they're having is heterosexual.  ...because who would want to be just vanilla?  In that way, yes, the usage in certain circles (not all, and not the original usage) does pose the same problem and for the same reasons that /u/veronalady put so nicely above.  Actual homosexuality though is pretty plainly defined. It's having sex with people of the same sex as you, there's no fuzzy borders.  So if someone wants to say ""homosexuals"" and ""normal people,"" well, I can see the homosexual people maybe getting upset (if the person saying it is clear about believing that only ""normal"" is allowed or good) but it's not any insult to the ""normal"" people because it's just saying, they don't have sex with members of their own sex, which is just... a fact, without much value judgement on it as to whether some individual qualifies for the label."
Gender_Critical,36r144,itazurakko,1 point,Fri May 22 03:11:59 2015 UTC,"Nah, this sounds grossly like ""Everyone's a little bit bisexual.""  Most bisexuals end up in heterosexual relationships.  Heterosexuality is more commonplace and easier to fall into.  Often times, ""queer"" people will still end up living a simply heterosexual life, but still refer to themselves as queer because 'my husband cooks and cleans and I fix the car' (this is referred to as queer heterosexuality and while it may seem personally progressive, it is politically regressive by assuming that just because your husband cooks and you know about cars, you are 'queer').

I would guess that most of the people who identify as non-binary are men, or, surely, they are the ones given the most attention and importance. And what bugs me most is that these men do realize that gender is not natural, as they try to reject masculinity in some aspects (mostly just the aesthetics, as they continue to support misogyny), but instead of realizing that gender is wrong, they think they are different. They are very happy with the idea that ""woman"" is a state of mind and ""man"" is another, they just think they were born ""different"". They are living proof that gender is completely a social construct, but they rather think that their actual material body is the unnatural thing."

However, I kind of hold out hope that the proliferation of non-binary pronouns and identities is the very silly dark horse that will make everyone throw up their hands and give up on gender altogether, by virtue of being absurd and impractical. And, whatever, teenagers are trying to navigate a difficult world. If throwing on different outfits and labeling themselves to oblivion is a step on the road to them telling gender to screw off, so be it.

Certainly not physically; even intersex people have a sex, though it's often difficult to tell, and these people are not intersex.  Is it something in their brains?  Which part?  The science, as best as I can tell, shows that male and female brains mostly look alike, with slight tendencies due to their sex.  You can't tell whether a brain is male or female from a brain scan.  And even you could, what about the people who are ""gender fluid,"" do their brains change?  Some people call themselves ""agender,"" do they have no brains?  And of course if it's to do with their interests, attire or personality that's just plain sexism.  Of course they'll tell you that it has to do with identity, and that this identity has nothing to do with your sex, your interests, your appearance or even your pronouns.  Which raises the question, if all your gender label tells you is that someone uses that gender label, why have it all?  If it conveys nothing, what does it matter?    I suppose this is an awful lot of talk for a label people clearly choose to make themselves seem special and so they can call themselves trans, but it does bother when they use it to prop up sexism.  Besides, any other human being can tell you that male and female are physical properties, no identity required.  If a male person changes his body so he appears to be a woman, I think it would be rather silly to pretend he isn't female in some sense, but on the other side of the coin, a man who's telling me he's neither male or female because he says so is idiotic.    tl;dr I don't go to your church, I don't believe in your god."

But holy shit, if even people like Jonah are getting your ire inspired this way, it's a prime example of letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.  How many men are even thinking about these issues this way?  Jonah Mix has some misogyny, as ALL MEN DO.  There is never going to be a perfect male ally.  This seems to be about performance politics and callout culture, not about actual incidents of misogyny.  I've consistently seen Jonah Mix be more respectful about being called out and ragged on than any man in feminism.  I think he's a nice, handy punching bag, so a lot of people who'd love to score points from both sides (radicaler-than-thou feminists and men who hate ""TERFs"" or even just hate unmasculine men) make sure they do.  And hey, it's fine as long as it's ""punching up,"" because privilege theory means ignoring the message in favor of the messenger.  I can pick anyone and pull apart all their Facebook posts if I decide to begin with that the very fact that they're saying words in public groups and on their own timeline about feminism is anti-feminist.

He had two tumblr blogs in which he actually passed himself off as a woman in order to gain cred in the community. That blog exists to try and make sure his past behaviour and identity is at least made clear to women in future.  And regardless, it is completely inappropriate for a heterosexual (or is he still claiming to be bi but only dating women?) man to do ""feminist activism"" that consists largely of him repeating womens' words back to them and waiting for the applause to roll in. Jonah has been told on multiple occasions that he makes many radical women uncomfortable. If he actually cared, he would stop inserting himself into womens' spaces and use his male privilege to address men.  Knowing a man personally does not make him not a creep.

Also, although I have no clue whether the BDSM blog accusations are true or this same kind of conflation, a LOT of radical feminist women I know used to engage in BDSM practices and watch BDSM pornography.  Many of them found radical feminism in large part because they realized how incredibly fucked up that sexuality was.  Should they all have to turn in their feminist cards?  How many BDSM videos does a person have to watch when they're a teenager before none of their contributions are valid when they reject that same kind of sexuality?  Jonah has been told he makes some radical women uncomfortable.  He's also been told by some women that his points are interesting and articulated in ways they hadn't heard before.  He's not repeating women's words back to them, he's working on ideas involving masculinity and gender that I often haven't seen expressed in a similar way at all before.  A 21 year old with a radical feminist mother and a head full of good ideas is not the person the movement needs to be setting up blogs to attack.  This just ensures that other men considering criticizing masculinity will know to keep silent.  Have you noticed that when a man criticizes masculinity, they get attacked from all sides?  The only way masculinity will stop being a destructive force is if men--yes, men like Jonah goddamn Mix--start talking about how destructive it is now.  For the most part, I have seen Jonah posting in spaces where he's talking not only to feminist women, but to a large number of men as well."

It was hard to get away from that kind of stuff, especially as a 21 year old who was desperate to find other likeminded (read: homosexual & bisexual) people, it was very easy to fall into the ""I'm liberated, I like BDSM!!"" stuff.  People do change and while it is a little harder to get over the male aspect, I was a porn addict and it took me along time to see wtf was wrong with everything about the situation.  I was a liberated female feminist, I knew what I wanted!  When it turned out that I was swallowing bullshit.  Men are capable of being allies.  I wouldn't call them feminists but I definitely think that they are capable of learning from their mistakes and growing.

They've been doing this for centuries and they can't stop us from getting away from them.  They will never be like us. No amount of foot stamping and whining can make them like us. Reality doesn't change because of feelings.  We all did, and other women, men and even trans people woke up to the extreme narcissism and violence that they harbour in the trans community.

Gender_Critical,36kzrg,voi_che_sapete,7,Wed May 20 13:46:08 2015 UTC,"That 'Inclusivity Cheat Sheet' is a perfect representation of what is happening in the real world. When I see that chart I label the first column 'MALE' and the second 'FEMALE', and these first two columns make up the 'Human' group. The third column is labelled 'QUASI-HUMAN PLAYTHING'. I truly believe that the overall male desire is to reduce females to a category even lower than 'quasi-human'. I include a fourth category on the chart labelled '100% Object'. Quasi-human and Object, of course, both being outside of the 'Human' group.   Males, in their quest to reduce us to objects, developed a need to infiltrate and take power in female-only spaces in order to alter the course of feminism and turn our march for equality around. But how would they do this? By 'becoming' females, of course. This seems to have got started in the 70s and has gradually gotten worse since then. I believe a few males tested the waters before the 70s, especially during and after our fight for the vote. Medical 'science' just hadn't reached a point where any of them could be taken seriously as females. Then came the Men's Rights group known as the 'Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association' in the late 70s and everything changed.   I'm going to cut out a lot of my standard rant here now since this is a comment and not my own post. I'll conclude with my prediction for the continued of march of the males through the Inclusivity Chart: 1. Once all females are reduced to Quasi-Human Playthings and only males occupy the 'female' column I predict many males will stop their forward progression through the chart there.  2. There may be just enough males who truly desire our reduction to object status that we see males begin to push into the quasi-human plaything column and push us into being total objects.  3. I predict no males will desire entering the 'Object' column and their forward progress will stop once females are truly objects lacking all human rights and the idea of 'equality' is murdered in cold blood.   The scary thing here is that there is only one group of feminists who are still fighting to stop this--and we're the minority in feminism. I hope we continue to grow and gain the power to stop this."

If you get more women than that, say, actually half women? All of a sudden there MUST be some hidden, nefarious agenda that is pumping the panel full of women at the ""expense"" of men, making things ""abnormal.""  Heaven forbid you get a panel that is majority of women, or ALL women.

It is a weird mix of my body being really weird, never being comfortable with the concept of gender and getting treatment and feeling better when I got to be me. Woman feels like the best fit, but I could never adequately explain why.  2) I guess so. But again, I couldn't really explain why. I just am?

Gender_Critical,36o6d1,voi_che_sapete,1 point,Wed May 20 21:19:50 2015 UTC,"1) Physically, certain symptons went away after I went through a sort of cis womens puberty (hormonally speaking). Now I have certain body parts that feel like they should have been that way at the start. it is a really strange feeling but it is all I have ever know. I still have body issues thanks to me measuring myself up against women in the media, but that is more society bullshit than trans issue.  2) External validation is a tricky one. But probably not for the reasons you think. When someone calls me a she, or my name, it is a signal that I can relax. This person gets it, this person is cool, I can relax. When a person catcalls me (which happens if I dare to wear a T shirt on a hot day) I want to strangle the guy. I guess if I had to choose, I would rather not have gender acknowledged at all. I didn't NEED NEED NEED she and her to be happy. But when they happen, it just shows I am safe and cool.  There is also an aspect of internalised transphobia. Basically, a life of being in the closet, seeing trans folk in the media getting mocked, and people who dared cross the gendered lines get ridiculed...it is hard not to grow up feeling like a freak. That isn't even unique to trans people, but it sucks. A lot. And when someone calls me a he, it sort of...brings all that back. It makes me feel rotten as shit.  I see you are calling me they, and that is cool of you considering your views. But if you ever call a trans woman a he, that is kind of what you are doing.  3) Passing is, again complicated.  If I could choose, I would have been born with the whole ride. The ability to carry a child (I want kids, and that is one of the things you gotto kiss goodbye to when you are a girl like me), the chromosomes the whole deal. But I hate the whole passing thing. Like, what the hell is wrong with being a woman who is trans? Why should I have to hide it? But the reality is, passing makes life easier.  And I would be lying if I said I wish I didn't want to pass. I am conflicted on the issue if you couldn't guess.  I really hope this is clear...."

I know you will all disagree with this, but I have to be honest...that is what I think."
Gender_Critical,36o6d1,lingeringthrowaway,2,Wed May 20 22:27:19 2015 UTC,"But whenever I hear someone say ""women only spaces"" when it comes to not letting trans folk into something....it always sounds like to me the reason is because ""trans women....ew"". And it always sounds like they are saying they have a fundamental right to not be around trans women because.....ew.   I can see why you'd think that, given so much of society does, unfortunately, have that reaction.   The thing is that while trans people do experience genuine prejudice based on the ""ew"" factor, it's not personal, at least in Michfest's case in the way the intent was framed. Often, when women point out sexism, men take it as ""you're attacking me"" -- when, even at its most harshly worded, that is not how it is meant. This is similar.  It has to do with real differences between women and trans women. It's like me, as a bisexual woman, getting upset at a lesbian-only gathering. It's unproductive, and the gathering wasn't meant for me anyway so I wouldn't get much out of it. Same with a gathering of only trans women. I'm sure there's lots to discuss that my perspective would only detract from.   At this point there really aren't very many ""women-born-women"" spaces, and with Michfest gone the biggest one is lost. I don't think that anyone is being denied entry to a hostel or a poetry reading, but there are some reasons why Michfest, among other places, might be different."
Gender_Critical,36o6d1,theowlgoeshoot,-1,Wed May 20 22:37:26 2015 UTC,"I always saw discrimination and prejudice as a thing that happens rather than a state of mind. If a trans woman is being told she can't seek shelter after a sexual assault, I don't care if it is because the person has a heart of gold and thinks trans people are awesome, but is wary of protecting the ""others"". One thing that kept happening when I first came out, was people telling me not to come out to the next person because ""I think it is cool, but they won't get it"".  I have applied for jobs where they said ""I am cool with being trans, I just think it would be an issue for our customers/co workers/Barry downstairs"". But the result is the same even if deep down they think I am a part of the global social marxist agenda (something I got accused of in the other one of these I did in the heart of the manosphere).  They are denying someone a thing because they are trans. Was michfest messed up for denying trans women? In my view, yes because of what it does. If someone broke my window, I wouldn't care about their reasons, I would want them to..fix it?  But I don't really care about michfest, because like I said, we got bigger fish to fry and even if I think it is fucked up, what was I going to do? Stop you? Meh, I got better things to do.  And i rarely find ""women only"" events. I do go to some geeky women groups sometimes, and I am always welcome. Honestly, I only ever see this issue come up from people I have no problem calling hateful morons on twitter. So it is refreshing to talk about this with someone who is actually a level headed and nice person for once.  So thanks for that."

By reinforcing patriarchy.  This is not an acceptable solution for feminists.   shining a light on the ludicrous suicide rate.   One that can be supposedly solved by insisting gendered body dysmorphia is permanent in spite of science, and that the only cure is massive surgical and hormonal adjustments couped with women being more accepting of men and their definitions of womanhood.

I want to ask what you think a woman is but so far your answers to others asking this have been unsatisfying and yes, feel like a cop out.

The English language is not at all prepared for this idea. The words don't exist. To the English language, there are only men and women. And that is it. The English language is far too clumsy to even try to explain what this shit is.

But...this is exactly what I mean when you come across like you think there's such a thing as 'mentally female' or 'mentally male'. Male and female are reproductive categories, not feelings or emotions. There's no need for more terms than male, female and intersex because that's all that exists.   You'd have to think there's some sort of female state of mind or female brain in order to believe you're 'actually' female despite being male. What exactly leads you to think you aren't a man?

It's kind of an amazing change from not even that long ago, which makes it interesting as a meme.   Used to be people (well, non-stealth people anyway) were happy to say things like ""when I was a man"" to refer to their lives pre-transition, or refer to growing up as a boy, no one really thought anything of it, and people would talk about being ""biologically male"" too. This was in trans-friendly spaces, among trans people, it was just no big deal. ""Since I became a woman"" etc too.  99% of the time there's no particular need to talk about it, but if you want to talk about transition, the words were there.  But now there's this insistence that biology too is ""female"" for the whole life, even before transitioning, and retroactive use of pronouns from birth and the whole bit, which really makes it hard to even talk about the issues, in forums dedicated to it even.  It's like, there used to be ""gender"" as a synonym for sex. Then for a while, there was a sweet spot where people said ""sex is biology, not changeable except cosmetically on the outside, but gender is your thoughts and feelings"" - and so all opinions on innate gender identity aside, it was clear what was being talked about.  But now we're back to having people insist sex and gender are the same again, only now they're both about feelz."

Then eventually, when things calm down, they stop posting and move on. It is the weirdest thing, when theyare at the other end of transitioning...people just dissapear, like they have been accepted back into society again.  I guess what I am saying is, the trans boards in most places are people under a shit ton of pressure. So I wouldn't take those places as a good sample of what the realitys of being trans is.

But I am going to answer you as best I can.  In my experience, my presence in womens spaces hasn't caused an obvious problem. And this is the case for the vast, vast, vast majority of trans people. So when you say ""women"" it is a bit misleading. The entirety of women haven't said no and are being ignored. That cause...just isn't that big right now. You probably have explanations why but I genuinely believe it is because people are very capable of being accomadating and accepting. Especially when it doesn't actually cause any real problems.  But there is a whole group (probably most of the people on this sub) whose argument is that they just don't want to be near trans women because they find them distasteful or ridiculous or just plain don't like them. It always sounds like the right people here are defending is ""the right to not be around trans women because....ew"".  If it is that ""right"" vs the right for a woman (who is trans) to be able to go to places and do things everyone else can....the latter wins. And like I said in another answer, sometimes the arguments I see here mirror the arguments made against race mixing in the 60's.  ""I don't mind trans women, but I don't want them using my bathroom"".  I know you disagree, and maybe even see me as an attack on you in some way. But let me put this to you.  How does me using a cubicle next to you to try on some jeans actually affect you?"
Gender_Critical,36o6d1,Astraloid,13,Thu May 21 04:08:30 2015 UTC,"Of course women are accommodating. Many women have been conditioned to be very accommodating, especially towards men and other people who are potentially loud, aggressive, and/or could cause us harm.

Gender_Critical,36o6d1,Astraloid,-4,Thu May 21 07:01:31 2015 UTC,I hadn't considered that. But weighing up this hypothetical possibility vs what could happen to me if I went into the gents....I got to take that risk.
Gender_Critical,36o6d1,Astraloid,11,Thu May 21 14:46:31 2015 UTC,LOL. Women have no right to not want males in our changing rooms because males pose 0 threat and aren't dangerous at all...but males who think they're female can't use the men's changing rooms because other males are dangerous. OK.

Gender_Critical,36o6d1,Astraloid,8,Thu May 21 00:55:02 2015 UTC,"You HADN'T CONSIDERED THIS?  Seriously, a ton of women will be nice...even over-the-top nice...to MTF trans people.  They'll use the pronouns.  They'll say the new name.  But it's because they've been trained to be nice.  They're trained to not cause trouble.  Privately they still think you're crazy, but women are trained to not tell crazy people they think they're crazy.  Watch what happens next time you see a crazy man corner a woman on the subway.  Watch her smile, nod, go through the motions.    And then, also, watch how women treat their gay male friends.  Even when people don't just outright think you're crazy and start appeasing you, my guess is that since you're basically a gay male who would prefer to sleep with straight men, women perceive you in the way they do their gay male friends.  You always have tampons for them and know how to do basic ""girl"" stuff?  Yeah, sounds like some of my straight lady friends' gay friends.  In my experience, women are more likely to accept gay men into their confidence about girly topics, but don't confuse that with people actually believing you're a woman in any way.  They feel bad for you and don't want to make you feel worse about yourself.  Don't confuse their kindness for actual shared delusion."

It always sounds like the right people here are defending is ""the right to not be around trans women because....ew"".   I don't see posts like that around here. Quite a few of us (myself definitely included) know trans people (M2T and F2T both), work with these people, know these people as fellow human beings, and are perfectly polite and friendly with them, because, well, fellow human beings. There is no ""ew"" going on, at least not on my part.  I do see posts that find the currently popular trans ""origin story"" ridiculous, but that is not at all the same thing.   The problem is that the current trans ""origin story,"" the whole ""born in the wrong body"" ""always been a woman"" ""brain intersex"" ""female brain"" idea, fundamentally contradicts with the entire basis of traditional feminism.  The entire enterprise relies on the idea that there is a ""proper"" ""matching"" relationship of thought processes and personality to genitalia, such that someone can have these two things, brain and bits, either ""on the same side"" or ""on the opposite side.""  In all the endless conversations about this, we hear constantly that ""cis"" (i.e., non-""trans"") people are supposedly all content with our ""gender identity.""  Problem is? Most women I know, certainly ones I talk to, and most definitely myself, don't have any sense of ""gender identity.""  I don't ""feel like a woman."" I was TOLD I'm a woman, due to my genitalia, and that's the entire end of the story, I do not have any more voluntary input into that than I do my race.   ...and yes, I know, we hear this ""you just can't feel it because you're 'cis.'""  Sorry, but I'm gonna call shenanigans on that, and I'm not alone. Plenty of times there's posts by trans people asking ""cis"" people who wander into trans spaces the rhetorical ""how do you know you're a guy"" (it's usually men for some reason) and the ""cis"" people pretty much always answer ""what? I have a penis. That's how I know.""  I.e., same thing. They realize that their bodies determined what category they were slotted into, and that was the end of the story. No feelz involved.  I do not believe in any sort of ""proper"" or ""matching"" relationship of thought process or personality or emotions to genitalia. You have a brain, you have a body, they're a valid combination, as a human being, that's it, and we have tremendous variation.  Whatever you do, however your brain is, it's a valid pattern for ""someone born with a penis"" to have. YOU define what those parameters of ""how people born with a penis can be,"" as a member. (But yes, I understand that being an outlier can lead to some intense social pressure.)  Back to the conflict with feminism.  This ""born in the wrong body"" or ""intersex brain"" thing also relies on their being a certain ""women's way of thinking,"" or should I say ""people born with vaginas way of thinking.""  Why? Because someone who is born with a penis, but feels out of place or strange, suddenly identifies this certain thought pattern (or patterns) as surely being ""patterns that people born with vaginas usually have."" (This despite the fact that there is NO WAY for someone born without a body part to even ever KNOW what someone born with it ""feels like"" inside. You simply can't know ""what it would feel like"" to be someone else.)  That is an obvious conflict with feminism. Feminists have fought forever against this idea that there is a ""way that women think"" or worse yet that there's a ""woman's way of thinking"" and it's all about HORMONES. It's sexist tripe of the worst sort, and now we see it being revived under the guise of pseudoscience with a shiny ""progressive"" veneer.  Is it really all that surprising that traditional feminists find the ""brain sex"" idea ridiculous?  You can't honestly say that you have no preconceptions of how women think, or how women ""are,"" and at the same time think that you can identify some pattern in yourself that would cause you, someone not born female, to be a woman.  Just because someone born male feels strange about his body or feels that he's not matching up with social requirements of masculinity or gender rules, that does not mean that ""well, if I don't fit 'man,' I must be 'woman.'""   Would ""transitioning"" and passing as a woman, having strangers on the street think you're female and thus respond to you as they do females help with dysphoria? Quite possibly, as people here admit all the time. You want the bodymods? Fine, it's a free country.   It's just the current origin story, the ""we're truly female in the brain, always been women from birth"" that's the offensive part.  As for the bathroom thing: First we have to admit that the bathroom troubles are an issue for NON-PASSING people. If you pass, no one is going to say word one about you using the bathroom because they're not gonna know you're trans.  Then, when we're talking about non-passing people, the issue is not that they as individuals are there to creep in the bathroom. The problem is, they often don't look any different from people who ARE there to creep in the bathroom.    So the current push for ""you should never complain about what look like creepers in the bathroom"" means that there might be a creeper in the bathroom, but you can't raise any alarm, because you'd be POTENTIALLY offending some poor trans woman.    It's an issue of do you err on one side, or the other? Not about insisting that ""truly trans"" people are the ones creeping in the bathroom."
Gender_Critical,36o6d1,wanderingwomb,-1,Thu May 21 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"Well, all I can say is in the UK this stuff has been made law, and there hasn't been a spate of creepers claiming to be trans sneaking a peak.  Honestly, I don't think most people even noticed.  I think feminism has moved on from the days of the Transsexual empire, and now is more about solving identifiable problems facing women. And the data just doesn't back up your ideas about people using being trans as a cover to invade bathrooms.  Also...would like to find the person who started this insane idea that there are guys wearing guy clothes, with beards and all that, saying they are women and walking into bathrooms. I have been to hundreds of trans events...I have NEVER seen that happen."
Gender_Critical,36o6d1,Stupalski,2,Thu May 21 01:43:00 2015 UTC,"People post the news stories all the time.  They are not trans women. They are men, in dresses (or other ""sissy"" attire), who aren't claiming anything at all about their identity. That's the part you miss - this isn't about trans people.  It's about trans people happening to look identical to another group of people who ""crossdress"" (often for fetish reasons more than any actual attempts at camouflage) and creep in bathrooms. They usually shave their beards.  Again, if you pass? You won't have a problem.  Among the identifiable problems facing women are the movements to prevent us identifying as a coherent class, of female people who share important experiences based on our physical bodies."
Gender_Critical,36o6d1,uterusesb4duderuses,-2,Thu May 21 01:47:18 2015 UTC,"Well, looking around, most of the feminist movement disagrees, as do I.  Agree to disagree?"
Gender_Critical,36o6d1,Stupalski,6,Thu May 21 02:03:48 2015 UTC,"Most of the feminist movement does not disagree, at all. You just don't know about it. You won't know that, because feminists don't get press or they get silenced. Pop feminists challenge nothing, they don't analyse patriarchy or the mechanics of womens' oppression. Their message is, ""everyone should be able to do what they want"", which means jack shit when power relations are radically unequal between the sexes, as they are. Which is why the only feminist message you hear is that one. it challenges nothing. Feminists oppose gender, it's the basis of feminism."
Gender_Critical,36o6d1,jiljol,7,Thu May 21 14:33:38 2015 UTC,"Women don't cause a problem. We take endless shit before we complain. Gender ensures that. When a man in a women's toilet dressed up stares at our teenaged daughter a bit too long, we just leave the room faster, and no-one ever hears about it. You are taking the silence of an oppressed group as an assent. Well done.   Your ""getting changed in the next stall"" isn't at all what concerns women. Any man could say that. ""I'm just getting changed, what's the problem?"" Sure, you shouldn't be here but, yes, nothing happened. I guess I can't claim this space because you didn't do anything this time. This space isn't mine anymore, though, is it? And when the next guy comes through, the one who isn't so nice, what can I, or my daughters say? Nothing. And every,EVERY argument trans make against preserving women's space could be made by any man. Think of that. Every claim trans make on women's space could be made just as easily by an MRA and probably has been. ""We aren't all bad. We aren't all hurting anyone. Are we 'ew' or something?""  Change stalls don't even bother me, so much. Where I live, public pools don't have stalls in their change rooms. All the women, young and old, change in a common space. How should I feel about a cock in front of my primary school aged daughters next time we change at the pool? Should I ignore my worries, even though I don't even know who this guy is, what sort of person he is, just to appease you and men like you? Or should I be a strong woman and mother and tell him to get the fuck out?  And the worst of all is letting men in women's prisons. Laverne Cox has advocated for murderers and rapists of women and children to be permitted in women's prisons because they identify as women. That's his main advocacy. Women are in prison mostly for crimes of poverty. Crimes of extreme violence and sexual violence are overwhelmingly committed by men, and some of these men are trans. But if you admit men are women, why exclude some men who identify as women, and why exclude some spaces?   The worst thing about this, that women, who are the people being imposed upon, are not even permitted to question this imposition without being slandered and abused. There's no discussion to be had, even though it is we giving something up. So entitled and patriarchal and oppressive, and you can't even see it."

Because it seems to basically look at trans people, almost exclusively. Which, if gender as an idea is an oppressive social construct, blaming trans people for it is like blaming Kazakhstan for global warming. We make up less than 1% of the planets population for crying out loud. And we don't have any money or any real power, even if you genuinely believe we are all just men in dresses. We don't have any CEO's (or if we do, nobody knows they are trans), we have no world leaders, barely any elected officials...the most famous trans person on the planet is an actor who makes up less than 10% of the screen time on a netflix show. It just doesn't make any sense to look at us as a group and blame us for little girls being forced to dress up as princesses at Halloween.  But the biggest issue by far is the bullying of young trans folk that happens. On sites like gender trender, and the things Cathy Brennan has done. It is just bullying, and I know that trans people can do that too, but it just looks more ingrained and more widespread in gender critical circles."

Places like these are the only places we can discuss that now, because general feminist places have been co-opted and women get kicked out and often face extreme consequences for having opinions or thoughts that go against the flow. So yeah, most of the general stuff can be discussed anywhere, places like this exist for the stuff you're not allowed to say elsewhere.   And we might be bitter, but it's for good reason.

There are alternative scouting organizations for boys that do not have the BSA's exclusionary policies for gay men.

I'm also uncomfortable about the lack of rules / standards - on a case by case basis is all well and good, but the parents of young female Scouts need to have some metric so they know what to expect in the development of their troop.

Sitting as students do at the Flodge, or the Marly, or what have you, accompanied by people I feel safe and comfortable with, I’ll either quite genuinely forget or alcohol will unlock the part of my brain that cares more about fucking with cisnormativity than it does my own personal safety.    There's your motivation. Indignation, resentment, aggressively seeking confrontation, often fueled by alcohol.  But they're such victims of cisnormativity that their indignation, resentment, and agressive confrontation is totally understandable!  There's a good reason they are more likely to behave themselves when sober, but then do this stuff when hitting the booze. It's because a big part of them knows it's an anti-social, inappropriate thing to do. Alcohol tends to strip people's pretense and expose their subconscious beliefs and motivations. When they get a little drunk, they begin to see their own reluctance to enter female washrooms and otherwise ""fuck with cisnormativity"" while sober as some kind of a humiliating and unjust oppression that they are being forced to cooperate with. So, they actually decide to ""fuck with cisnormativity"" extra hard because of their alcohol-fueled bravery. It sounds like some kind of narcissistic example of reaction formation."

For me, that work has meant being mindful about not interrupting people, watching how much space I take up in public, moderating the degree to which I express violent emotions, not taking for granted the service of others, and consciously creating space and opportunities for marginalized people rather than taking it away from them. Those things I work on. Not because those problem behaviors are inherently ""male,"" but because they are inherently oppressive. Like, please don't interrupt and shout over other people at community meetings. That's a really terrible thing to do, regardless of your gender.   But you did experience a specific type of privilege, because you are MALE.  You were born with a PENIS.   Because you were born with a penis, and for no other reason, you were placed into the ""boy"" category. As you put it:   Boy was forced on me when I was too young to consent (a massive childhood trauma that would overshadow the rest of my life), and I did live under that imposed identity for a very long time.   You had a PENIS, and that simple fact meant that you were socialized as a boy, raised as a boy, treated by all and sundry as a boy, and given specific privileges and positive reinforcements which are routinely denied to girls (people born without the almighty penis).  Part of that socialization includes teaching you these various ""things you work on.""  But the key thing you need to realize is that yes, those problem behaviors were induced by certain socialization that was given to you because of your penis.  So yes, in a very real way, they ARE in fact ""male.""  They correlate higher with male people, because of the way that male people are raised.  Sure, it happened from the time you were a baby and like any other kind of privilege, it's not something to feel ""guilty"" for as an individual. But it's our responsibility to recognize it for what it is, and to realize that it can cause damage and oppression to those people who were not born with a penis (who just like you, were slotted into a category - girl this time - without any input or required ""identification"" on their part). And to work on it, which it's nice to see that you are.  ""Girl"" HAPPENS, just like ""boy"" HAPPENED to you. It's not about identity.  Should genitalia define us? Heck no!  But in reality, genitalia ARE very important, for the simple reason that it's the presence or lack of a penis that gets us placed, BY OTHERS, regardless of any identity, into the categories that fundamentally shape how we are raised and what oppressions we face, what privileges we get. The taking up of too much space (as opposed to just being assertive), the feeling of entitlement to the services of others, is something that is socialized not into a random assortment of kids, but into (for the most part) the specific group of ""kids born with penises.""  And the babies who get socialized to be quiet, don't rock the boat, don't take risks, always put others' needs first? Overwhelmingly, they're ones born without penises. It's not random at all.  Doesn't matter if we like our genitals, or feel dysphoric over them. They set the socialization in motion way back when we were babies.   Some of those children born without penises and therefore raised to be meek and put others first grow up to want some space where they can work through this issue and gain some confidence and learn to be more assertive, in the presence of others like themselves who are at a similar disadvantage, so they can learn together and ramp it up slowly with extra supports.  Where do they go for this? Women's groups. Women's colleges. Women's environments that are designed to shut out, if temporarily, the presence of people who are at a massive advantage because they were socialized the other way.  All people should be raised to be assertive. But they aren't. And when you put people who were raised to be assertive and confident and dominate space in with a group of people who were explicitly raised the opposite way, raised to give ground, well... the assertively raised people end up taking over all the space. It's just dynamics.  This goes beyond any individual experiences of ""but I was a shy boy"" or whatever. It's group dynamics.  Obviously not all spaces should be segregated. But there's a place, a need, for some exclusive space for those people born without penises, to deal with their issues.  And for someone to come by and say that ""well, I was born with a penis, and so now that I'm living among people who were born without, I find I do so much better at these universal good goals of being assertive and confident than they do"" - it's kind of a slap in the face, quite frankly.  Yeah, we all want to be assertive and confident, that's the goal of women as well as men. But right now women (i.e. the kids born without penises) are at a disadvantage still growing up. To have someone who was born with a penis come by and say ""I'm better than you at your life goal"" and particularly to then say ""this makes me a better woman"" - well, don't let the door hit ya, is basically the response you're gonna get.  ...and so knowing that someone was born with a penis? Yeah, it's important."

So I'm sure this is important and interesting information, but:   1) We need to be able to look at this evidence soberly without being caught in the trap of assuming too much about it, i.e., adhering it neatly to a given theory. Bear in mind that Simon Baron-Cohen, that king of confirmation bias, was used to dictate educational policies!   2) Even if you buy that the brain is as uncomplicatedly dimorphic as these people are presenting, these studies often seem to say that trans people ""occupy middle ground,"" not that they are equivalent with their identified-with gender (and what often goes unsaid is that the trans person's brain is in most respects quite close to their physical sex; it's not clear why those specific regions of the brain might be different, and social factors are not controlled-for). In this lens, trans women look like trans women, and trans men look like trans men. Trans women don't look like women and trans men don't look like men.   The ""Networks of the brain"" article is particularly overreaching, given its reliance on one study with a tiny sample size to say they ""..were able to demonstrate that the very personal gender identity of every human being is reflected and verifiable in the cross-links between brain regions.""

(Just look at the rows and rows of pink at the stores. And it honestly seems like 90% of all little girls I see in public these days are dressed at partially, if not entirely, in pink.) So I played with all kinds of toys, from dolls and bears to cars and trains and blocks, and no one ever even suggested this might mean I was ~genderqueer~ - they were just - obviously! - fun toys to play with. I was physically active, and that was also just a normal part of childhood - climbing and exploring and being unafraid. I don't remember any specific messages I got from my parents about gender at that age, but I do remember when my father told me, at age 10 or so, that women weren't supposed to sit with their knees apart or their hands on their heads (the explanation of the latter being that female underarms should be hidden at all costs). I could go on, but I don't think my (current) critical attitude towards gender came in any way from my parents - unless it's partially because my father ruled over the family as the ultimate patriarch, thus instilling in me a healthy hatred of men and misogyny. :)"

TBH ""gender"" is just one of many boxes that kids are shoved into much more forcefully now - for example most of us didn't have some sort of medical diagnosis, we had personalities that were dealt with, sometimes appropriately and sometimes terribly.  Personally if I had been born 10 years later I would've been diagnosed with ADD and placed on drugs to control it, but as it was my teachers concluded that I learned quickly and I was bored stiff sitting in a classroom so they placed me in a ""gifted and talented"" program where we learned by doing.  A few years after I graduated high school the program was shut down for being elitist and making other kids feel bad about themselves... then everyone started wondering why so many kids had to take Ritalin.  Now we've moved on to putting kids that don't behave on estrogen/testosterone.  Brave New World, indeed."

They gave me books like Where Did I Come From and tapes like Free To Be You And Me.  They also used white-out and my mother's tiny perfect penmanship to equalize the pronouns in many of my children's books so that girls/women wouldn't be underrepresented; it still sounds weird to me when people talk about the Cat In The Hat as if she is male.

When I moved to the States at a young age, all the sudden it was all about ""Boys drool and girls rule"" and ""Girl power"" and ""You throw like a girl!"" I started hanging out with only girls, and I noticed they really liked things like makeup and nail polish (which in turn the boys hated and were grossed out at). Where I came from, those things were for much older, more sophisticated people, not kids.  My country of origin is very strange. It's still got very sexist patriarchal norms, yet I grew up with stories/cartoons/comic books of very confident, well respected female characters with a lot of depth. It was not rare at all to see male characters in those stories to just be the father in the background or be the lesser developed romantic interest to the heroine who was the main protagonist.   There was also many depictions of homosexual characters in those stories, too, and I don't remember it being a big deal at all. They just were people who happened to like people of the same sex. Crossdressers also showed up not infrequently in these stories, but they were just men/women who liked to crossdress.

Those stories often don't exist. I'm not in favor of lying to children either, but I think this approach is more about reappropriating stories to present feminist messages than it is about deceiving children. Think of it as a remix or retelling. Without the framework of copyright and capitalism, what makes rewriting another person's story unethical? Leaving books untouched preserves authorial intent, sure, but at the expense of promoting misogyny. Have you read Sandra Bem's An Unconventional Family? She and her husband edited their children's books and more. Since I don't have a copy of her memoir at hand, here's an overview of the relevant details from Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender:   Theirs was a two-pronged strategy. First, the Bems did all that they could to reduce the normally ubiquitous gender associations in their children’s environment: the information that lets children know what toys, behaviours, skills, personality traits, occupations, hobbies, responsibilities, clothing, hairstyles, accessories, colours, shapes, emotions and so on go with being male and female. This entailed, at its foundation, a meticulously managed commitment to equally shared parenting and household responsibilities. Trucks and dolls, needless to say, were offered with equal enthusiasm to both children; but also pink and blue clothing, and male and female playmates. Care was taken to make sure that the children saw men and women doing cross-gender jobs. By way of censorship, and the judicious use of editing, WhiteOut and marker pens, the Bems also ensured that the children’s bookshelves offered an egalitarian picture-book world:   [M]y husband and I got into the habit of doctoring books whenever possible so as to remove all sex-linked correlations. We did this, among other ways, by changing the sex of the main character; by drawing longer hair and the outline of breasts onto illustrations of previously male truck drivers, physicians, pilots, and the like; and by deleting or altering sections of the text that described females or males in a sex-stereotyped manner. When reading children’s pictures books aloud, we also chose pronouns that avoided the ubiquitous implication that all characters without dresses or pink bows must necessarily be male: ‘And what is this little piggy doing? Why, he or she seems to be building a bridge.’    Much of the criticism of what they did is that it was too extreme - why doctor books when you can just present children with sexist reality and tell them to think critically? And Sandra Bem - quite rightly, I think - disagreed with this, since children (and adults, I would add) will still absorb messages even when presented with critical commentary. The idea was that the Bem children would grow up, for at least a few years, not even knowing that gender roles were a thing, so that rejecting them would be so natural, so second-nature that once they did meet the unavoidable specter of sexism in their surroundings, they would be well equipped to challenge it."
Gender_Critical,36800n,linoleumblock,2,Tue May 19 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"Those stories often don't exist.   Actually, there are many.  Off the top of my head: Pippi Longstocking.  Stellaluna.  Amazing Grace.  Little House on the Prairie series.  Caddie Woodlawn.  Patricia Wrede's dragon series.  A Wrinkle in TIme.  E. Nesbit's books.  Eva Ibbotson's books.  Tell or write your own stories if you don't care for any of those.  It encourages your own creativity and that of your children, and if you are going to the trouble of doctoring books anyway, you might as well start over and invent something of your own.  I loved to read as a kid, and although some of those books I mentioned weren't around until later, there were many I enjoyed, since I didn't find books without girls in them very interesting.  I also learned to read very young and got my hands on any reading material I could.  I think those kids might question it the first time they get a library copy of a book or talk to another kid about the shared experience of a book.  I think discussing it honestly and openly is more appropriate.  I think television and movies are much more likely to be absorbed as messages since they are visual.  You can try to keep your children from them as much as possible (my parents did) but they will still absorb culture from visual media and peers at least as much as from books."
Gender_Critical,36800n,radishe,2,Tue May 19 03:29:11 2015 UTC,"Most, if not all, of those stories exist in the context of patriarchy. The Little House books being a good example (and a series I did love as a child, although it and my love for historical fiction in general surely contributed to my antiquated views on a lot of things, including 19th century gender roles). I agree that it's essential to center literature around girls, but this doesn't change the fact that reading a book to a child in which a girl is different and daring because she challenges the feminine role subtly serves to teach children that there is a feminine role and challenging it isn't neutral but daring. That girls are supposed to be like what that girl isn't. Sandra Bem recounts a similar incident in which she couldn't read the standard picture books about boys being gender-nonconforming to her son for a while, because she didn't want to teach him that there was anything gender-nonconforming about behavior that should be neutral. And so he learned barrettes and skirts and dolls to be neutral, until he went to kindergarten, met other children's sexism, and then the picture books came in handy.  I agree about TV and movies and would also avoid them as much as possible.  I don't know what the solution is, short of moving to lesbian separatist land and cutting off contact with the rest of the world (I do like this idea, but it obviously wouldn't work for everyone), but certainly keeping children from misogyny as much as possible is, I think, as healthy for them psychologically as keeping them from eating poison is for their digestive systems. There's a point at which you can't do it any longer, but if they have a feminist foundation to fall back on, the ""critical commentary"" approach is all the more likely to be successful. The full-honesty approach is the equivalent of saying, ""Welcome to the world, dear daughter, a world in which you are a second-class citizen. It shouldn't be that way, and I don't want you to think of yourself as a second-class citizen, but the reality is you are. How about we analyze the woman-hating in this children's book?"""
Gender_Critical,36800n,radishe,2,Tue May 19 04:10:34 2015 UTC,"Everything exists within the context of patriarchy.  I don't think that trying to teach your child it doesn't exist will help them live in this world any better.  I am childless by choice, for many reasons, not the least of which is that I don't think it's a good world to bring up any child in.  Creating a better one would be nice but isn't realistic.  To me what you are describing sounds nice but would end up being a bit like Santa Claus, (kid finds out one day you lied to it) and maybe a bit like the liberal Christian church I was raised in that changed hymns and biblical passages to be gender neutral and alternated pronouns.  It was annoying and I knew what they were trying to cover up anyway.  I would love to live in a lesbian separatist community also.  It is sad to me to see women's space disappear and get smaller and smaller with time, with the need for it seeming to get larger.  I don't think that honesty is the same thing as telling your daughter she is second class."
Gender_Critical,36800n,radishe,1 point,Tue May 19 05:31:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want to deny the existence of patriarchy, just let them develop a sense of self before actually having to face misogyny. I think it's important to let girls understand themselves to be real, full, complex people before they meet the world that denies them this and kills their spirits. Maybe this is cruel, or pointless, if they are going to recognize misogyny anyway, or maybe it's a rare and essential escape. In a similar way to female-only spaces, which would serve this function more effectively than they do, were they able to exist and thrive.   I don't think that honesty is the same thing as telling your daughter she is second class.   I don't think there is any way to learn that you are inferior without feeling inferior. And the reality of patriarchy is that women are inferior. Shouldn't be, but are.  So my words aren't misunderstood, here's Catharine MacKinnon articulating what I mean better than I could:   If male power makes the world as it ""is,"" theorizing this reality requires capturing it in order to subject it to critique, hence to change. Feminists say women are not individuals. To retort that we ""are"" will not make it so; it will obscure the need to make change so that it can be so. To retort to the feminist charge that women ""are"" not equal, ""Oh, you think women aren't equal to men"" is to act as thought saying we ""are"" will make it so. What it will do instead, what it has done and is doing, is legitimize the vision that we already ""are"" equal. That this life as we live it now is equality for us. It acts as if the purpose of speech is to say what we want reality to be like, as if it already is that way, as if that will help move reality to that place. This may work in fiction, but it won't work in theory. Rather, if this is reality, nothing needs changing: this is freedom; we choose this. To me, this answer is about denial and is the opposite of change.   (p. 59, Feminism Unmodified)  In the misogyny-free childrearing approach, the idea is to actually create an alternative reality for at least the first few years of life. For girls to have a chance at being something other than what male supremacy does to them. Which they will come to know soon enough anyway, to at least some degree, even on lesbian separatist land.   I am childless by choice, for many reasons, not the least of which is that I don't think it's a good world to bring up any child in. Creating a better one would be nice but isn't realistic.   I feel the same way. Bringing a child into this world would be cruel - but if I did, I'd try to protect her from male violence as much as I could.

The reality is that patriarchy will try to convince us that we are inferior.  Catherine MacKinnon is making my point, and seems to be strongly in favor of reality and working for change rather than pretending it already exists.  But what makes you believe that taking male centered narratives, by male authors, and changing around the pictures and pronouns, will leave you with something more feminist than stories with complex fully formed female characters from a feminist writer, or if those seem too much grounded in reality for you, creating your own?   The male centered narrative is still there, whether or not it is in a drawn on dress or with breasts added to it."

Things got even worse after moving to the States and my father developed a much more conservative group of friends than he had before. I remember when I was little my mum was able to speak to my father's friends and I was also allowed to be in the same room. A little after the move my mum and I were forced to leave the men alone entirely when there was male company--my brother's presence was acceptable.   My mum and I were responsible for the 'women's work'. My father and brother were responsible for the 'important work'. My parents did their best to build my life on a foundation of my appearance and behaviour. My grades and my awards for being a great student mattered not at all (my brother was praised almost daily for his mediocre academic performance), at least not after entering high school. What mattered was that I looked pretty and that my manners would hopefully attract a 'good Christian boy'. It was God's plan for me to live the life the other women in my family had lived. My mum married my father when she was 18 (he was 26). My maternal grandmum married my grandad when she was 17 (he was 24). My great grandmum was apparently married when she was only 15 (and to a much older man). Had my life not shifted so violently off the path my parent's set for me I'd have probably been married at 17 or 18 and had at least two children by now. I'm the first woman of my family to break free.   If I weren't a lesbian and had not come out when I did (16) it's possibly I wouldn't have broken free, but when I came out my father kicked me out. My coming out marked the end of my upbringing and I was given a violent push off a cliff down into the real world. Then two months after my homelessness began I was beaten and raped, spent several weeks in hospital, was released into my father's care and taken home. A few days after being back home he told me what had happened to me was God's plan for getting me back on a righteous path and he was glad God had made it clear to me that I was meant to be with a man. My own father was happy I'd been punished by God with a violent rape because he thought having a man inside me would have cured me of my homosexuality. I ran away after that and have only looked back a couple of times trying to establish at least a phone relationship with my parents. That relationship failed to develop. After all of this happened the rest of my family was quick to divorce me as well. The only person who didn't was my grandmum, surprisingly. She did a lot to help me heal and start a life after I survived my surprisingly-unsuccessful suicide in 2006, and she was my best friend until she died in 2012.

With respect to Facebook, the happy medium I've found is advocating for gender liberation without referencing trans people at all. If people try to make what I say about trans issues, I respectfully refocus the conversation back to females, back to the harmfulness of gender, and back to the realities of sex-based oppression. I express genuine sympathy and swiftly ""put the focus back on the female,"" as antilla-dean from tumblr says. Ultimately, as hard as these people are making it for us, this is about fucking liberating females from gender roles and no one should be distracted by that because other types of people have problems. I express compassion, then refocus.  Bear in mind, always, that their ideology is incredibly internally inconsistent and that just as female feminists will turn on you, you have allies on both sides of the fence. There are trans women out there who are fed up with this too -- and while it is very risky for them to speak up, in my experience they will stand up to advocate for you!

Maybe a trans man would eventually use his identity to resist the notion that femaleness means he's bad at math or something, but I still think (and observe, for whatever that's anecdotally worth) that they generally have not absorbed a lot of those childhood lessons that would give them male privilege on that front. It would be useful to sketch out some scenarios to help people sort out their experiences, but it's all pretty speculative at this point.

If so, I think that's bullshit, because (1) many trans men / trans women did not think of themselves as boys / girls throughout their entire life (2) even if you do think of yourself a certain way, that won't change how other people treat you (3) I think it's impossible to be consistently treated a certain way without that having some impact on how you view yourself (internalization)  If it's referring to post-transition ""internalizationz,"" I can see potentially some difference (assuming the people in question pass), but even major cognitive dissonance reduction doesn't change the fact that trans people know on some level what their actual sex is.

Wow, so much BS here I can't even address it all at once.   introducing a new focus on queer theory   Well, they got that right at least.   abolishing gender role expectations   That's exactly what the third wave is not about (and the second wave, incidentally was).

First of all, transwomen don't know what it's like to 'feel female' because they are male, but the author of the article acts like they do, because men are taken at their word when they claim to 'feel female'. Female isn't a feeling, it's a biological reality.  Secondly, female entitlement? Did the author forget to check the article for mistakes before publishing it, or are they serious?   They believe anyone born a man retains male privilege in society.    Well transwomen seem to be taken at their word when they make ridiculous claims, like in the example above, and women aren't listened to on a class level when they say things that make sense (like that they're human beings or that they know what female means), so I'd say that transwomen are privileged over women.   Even if he chooses to live as a woman, and therefore accepts a correspondingly subordinate social position, the fact he has a choice means he will never know what it is like to be a woman.

""And all of these exclusions are based on a simple transmisogynist idea – that trans women aren’t women.""   That's because 'trans women' aren't women. ;)   ""my close trans women friends and I who aren’t read as cis women, often don’t go to women’s spaces alone.""   Poor baby boy. Why not? Afraid a real woman's going to beat you up? Wait...that actually doesn't happen. You and your male buddies are the ones beating, stalking, assaulting, and raping us in female-only spaces.    ""Sometimes we’re incredibly isolated and don’t leave our homes for fear of public scrutiny and shouted (or whispered) insults.""   Fucking deal with it! We real women must deal with near constant fear in public spaces of being followed, assaulted, groped, kidnapped, trafficked, raped, etc. And you're whinging about fear of scrutiny and insults? Fuck off.    ""There’s also the life-risking endangerment when we are denied critical resources such as shelters...""   Just stop. Women built these shelters for girls and women. If you want a shelter then go build one. Those of us who need these shelters would not feel safe in them with you and your other male buddies there. When I was living in a women's shelter it had a strict no male policy that included no minor males over the age of 12. It made me and the other girls & women there who had been raped feel safe. The presence of someone like you would have made us fearful, anxious, and likely would have caused sleep deprivation, panic attacks, and flashbacks.    ""There is no singular female body""   True. However, there is a distinct difference between the various types of female bodies and the types of male bodies. You have a male body. You're male.    ""This is a step towards unlearning that penises equates to maleness. That our breasts, whether flat or hormone-grown or implanted, are our breasts and just as natural as any other breast.""   I just came very close to getting sick on my laptop. This is just disgusting. Penises are male organs and the breasts you get are not natural, full stop.    ""Not recognizing our bodies as naturally female supports a patriarchal culture that defines what a woman’s body is.""   No. No. No. No. NO! Recognising your bodies as naturally male supports BIOLOGICAL FUCKING REALITY! Recognising you as female, however, would certainly support the patriarchal definitions of 'woman' given that you're a man telling us what the definition is.   ""Instead of saying trans women are welcome to an event run by cis women, have actual trans women in leadership positions to create the events that center and support us. Be someone who offers resources and support to allow us to develop our own women’s spaces. That’s the kind of solidarity that truly makes social change.""   Translation: ""We don't only want to be welcomed. We want to fucking take over--as men do.""   ""Whether a woman has a womb or not, her womanhood shouldn’t be dependent on what she produces.""   I agree. If I were to have a hysterectomy or if I'd been born with MRKH or CAIS or something resulting in me never having a uterus I wouldn't be any less female because of that. However, you not being born with a uterus is not a medical condition like MRKH or CAIS. It's simply the male biological reality, thus you have no right to the claim that you are female despite not having a uterus.    ""Trans women aren’t male, so we don’t benefit from male privilege and never have.""   LMFAO! What? Just...what?! I have read too many stories of successful and wealthy men becoming 'women' that I absolute know that this isn't true. The lot of you enjoy the benefit of being taken seriously, not being talked over, not having your decisions questioned because you're female, etc. Like every other man in modern society you have the benefit of being seen as a whole person capable of independent thought and action. However, we females don't have that benefit. We're seen as only part of a person, incapable of thought and action independent of male consideration, intervention, or approval. One of the benefits of your male privilege is being blind to it.    ""we all have the same socialization""   No. We absolutely do not.    ""I know the stakes of being a trans woman are higher in terms of extreme violence, death, and suicide""   Wrong again. You don't face anywhere close to the same level of violence as females do. You're not raped, assaulted, kidnapped, trafficked, or beaten at anywhere close to the same rate as females. The violence you do experience tends to be self-inflicted (suicide) or the result of your lies to other men about your male sex (I'm not condoning or encouraging violence against the trans cult here, just stating a fact).

Heterosexual males are not very useful for this, because let's face it -- even though they putatively prefer women, there are many fetishists among them, including those with sexual interest in transgenders. The most prized validation can only come from lesbians, who by definition only have sex with females.   EDIT: changed ""transsexuals"" to ""transgenders"" because that's what I meant."

You can't avoid the guys making sure all women in the community are at least considering sex with them as a possibility.

I have a sex and I have a personality that is not innately linked to my sex, not a ""gender"" or a ""gender identity"".

Gender_Critical,360xaq,linoleumblock,3,Fri May 15 22:58:35 2015 UTC,one could argue that losing control to that degree is more scary because it suggests it could happen again. premeditation suggests you could reason with the person and have them not do it again. being so weak in emotional control that you could fly off the handle and beat someone to death with a baseball bat is far more worthy of being kept confined away from the rest of civilization forever.  the problem is we have this stupid justice system which is based on punishment instead of protection. you did something wrong now we get to punish you for it. that stance implies we take a satisfaction in doing so. that may be true on an individual basis because individuals who are directly affected by a crime are susceptible to bias in the judgment of the person but the state should not be passing judgement as if it derives satisfaction and then going easy on someone because they didnt know better. The real point is that we need to protect everyone else.

Both are about identifying only with your pre-frontal cortex, and rejecting your entire body as some kind of oppressive 'bag of skin' that causes pain and requires maintenance. Transhumanists talk about ""morphological freedom"", thinking they ought to be able to have freedom to take whatever shape they want, and look forward to disposing of their bodies entirely when they can finally upload their consciousness into a computer (The whole thing is based on a misunderstanding of philosophy of mind. Apparently these people have never heard of John Searle's ""Chinese Room"" argument.)  Both are based on Cartesian dualism. Both believe that the body should be surgically altered in order to be improved. Both believe that the internal self or identity is essential, while the body is just a vessel. Both resent their bodies and see them as a burden.  It's all based on dissociation. I can only imagine that younger generations sitting around playing video games all day, constructing complicated virtual lives, being fascinated with anime and really shallow-minded science fiction, definitely contributes to this dissociation.

I suspect that this is the reason that their suicide rates are high even after transition. The gap between their fantasy and reality can never be closed.

(Despite what Michfest had meant to her as a young lesbian.) Sparrow became a ""bisexual lesbian."" (Sorry, that's not a lesbian.) With important messages about how terrible it is to discriminate against men and straight couples. Mo, the last symbol of lesbian feminism, started dating Sydney, the epitome of postmodern academia nonsense, and they even sold their online sexual exchanges literally for money, as pornography. And, of course, everyone broke off into their little nuclear families and voted for the Democrats.

I would’ve just gone down that road if it had been there. But I’m so glad it wasn’t, because I really like being this kind of unusual woman. I like making this new space in the world.  Among lesbians of a certain generation, there’s an ambivalence about the emergence of the transgender identity.

Charley is believed the first woman to vote in a presidential election in 1868, in her male persona, of course.  Sampson disguised herself as a man only during her army years, later going on to marry and have children, but Parkhurst's sex was discovered only after her death.  She, at some point before taking her stagecoach job, had given birth to a child, which her autopsy revealed.  Below is a comment I made on an article about Parkhurst that called her transgender, explaining why dubbing historical people as transgender is intellectually dishonest:  Unlike in the 21st century, where women may freely engage in any activity or lifestyle that suits her, openly as a woman, we must remember that people in centuries past did not have that freedom. For those uncomfortable with the roles and activities traditionally associated with their sex, taking on the ones associated with the other sex was never easy and often impossible to do without unpleasant consequences. Such consequences could range from simple ridicule, to harassment, to shunning, to being locked up in an insane asylum or jail, to mention just a few possibilities. So, for any woman who found the position in society assigned to her sex to be stultifying, and who wished to have the life choices limited to the men of her time, had to disguise herself as a man to do so and to consistently refer to herself as a man, lest her secret be discovered.  It is assuming facts not in evidence to assume that Charley believed that she actually WAS a man simply because she preferred the freedom allowed only to the men of her era and engaged in many activities prohibited to women. People in the 19th century didn't think like that; to draw the conclusion that she was transgender is to impose 21st century sensibilities on a 19th century person. I do think it's possible, however, that Charley might have wished to have been a man and no doubt thought life would have been much easier to have been born male, but then, so do many modern women who do not identify as transgender."

Gender critical feminism is about contextualizing gender in our society, instead of focusing on how to fix individuals. We need to fix society's expectations, not tell gender non-conforming children they are the wrong sex!   The actual murderer barely enters the stage as the cause of the murder; neither do transphobia, as well as violence against women, immigrants, sex workers or poor people.   It's actually a classic, patriarchal reversal. It's not violent men and society who murder trans people and make their life intolerable. It's the nature of being transgender itself.    To pathologize their refusal of and discomfort with the social expectations of their natal sex and locate the source of the problem within the child ignores the conditions in which the suffering has developed.    Johnny wants to wear a dress, but is made fun of and told he cannot. Let's ignore the fact he's really suffering because of how gender is enforced (aka the actions of others) and pretend that it's just because he is somehow wrong (aka Johnny needs to be a girl) Again, it's blaming an individual instead of the social context the individual lives in.   Simplifying and decontextualizing their suffering might lead clinicians astray in recognizing what is vexing the child and make promises that the magic bullet of puberty suppression might fail to keep.   Which is why we see detransistioners and the fact that regret peaks 10 years after surgery. You've promised to fix everything with transition, but you have done nothing to fix our sick society."

Gender_Critical,35slqx,generibus,7,Wed May 13 06:11:31 2015 UTC,"Well, they do say it's not common    Women need to be reassured that while pelvic sexual arousal is not a common response to breastfeeding, when these feelings occur they are normal."
Gender_Critical,35slqx,Reddwollff,7,Wed May 13 07:22:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced either, the references mainly consist of general breastfeeding books and general papers not specifically on breastfeeding and they say it's not common despite all of that. I'll put that on the bollocks list with ""bonding"" and ""orgasmic childbirth"".  Being a milch cow is decidedly unsexy, the fact is that you are focused on making sure baby is fed.  It's more the reverse, libido goes down, and it takes a lot of energy to make that milk and maintain an adequate supply and then there's the time to feed as well. Unless you are a autogynephile of course, there's one there in the comments that wants it because it will make them a ""real genetic woman"" and they think it increases libido.  As for the medications they took, I don't understand at all doing that especially when you could do things like bottle feed expressed milk from the actual mother (who barely gets a mention in the article, it's that ""we"" are pregnant thing) and this can create closeness too. Most doctors won't prescribe it, and the Ministry of Health where I am does not recommend it's use for lactation purposes."

Women and their bodies cannot be complex,  they are aroused (hysteric) and thus causing problems especially for their male children.

Looks like domperidone is a validated treatment for increasing lactation in women.

Also, I'm taking half of my pre-breastfeeding dose of estrogen, which is not recommended while nursing because it can have a negative effect on milk supply. It is considered safe for the baby though   Still taking estrogen. Huh. ""Half your dose"" is that more or less than a woman after pregnancy. Does this dude even know? What about the anti-androgens he takes? Or did he stop those?  And also progestin because it makes him feel lovely. That is literally the only reason he is taking it still.  Fucking creepy scumbag."

You say that domperidone is okay, but what about all the other medicines, including hormonal birth control?  I'm just wondering, since this lesbian couple (women born women) co-nursed their baby: http://www.today.com/parents/co-nursing-conundrum-are-four-breasts-better-two-1C7397899  I am starting from the assumption that if it is harmful to the baby, then it is unethical. From a radical feminist perspective, I wouldn't really have a problem with men or women partners (responsibly) helping out with the labor that goes into childrearing. Although, in the case of the MtF breastfeeding his child, the intentions are obviously narcissistic (using his child to validate his illusions), which is not what parenting should be about!"
Gender_Critical,35slqx,pharmavixen,2,Mon May 25 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. My ethics are also shaped by what is harmful.

The first few weeks were a struggle - cluster feeding is seriously fucking awful at times. But I'm so proud of myself for doing it and getting where I am now.   You know what would not have helped? Having my narcissistic partner 'help' with feeding. It would not have helped. It would have undermined my relationship with my baby. It would have given me supply issues. It would probably have led to engorgement issues and plugged ducts.   You know what did help? Having my partner support me emotionally and practically. For the past two and a bit months he has done every single bit of cleaning, cooking, washing, shopping, tidying, you name it. Because it would have been almost impossible to do any of that stuff on my own with a tiny baby while establishing breastfeeding. When you are glued to the chair during a mammoth feed you need somebody there to wait on you hand and foot, bring you drinks, cut up and feed you your dinner, pass you something to read, etc. God, the last thing you need would be your bloody partner standing there going, 'me! me! let me have a go!', undermining you at every step so he could fulfil his little fantasy of being a woman.

Without any real screening for donor risk and a fair amount of time these products being taken from risky populations (such as from IV drug users or prisoners) they had no chance at all.

Meanwhile, if he actually passed as a woman, no women would have noticed him out of place in the women's or complained about it. This particular incident isn't hypothetical worrying by the employer. Women actually have complained about him - both coworkers and random public women using the courthouse, to the point of one of them complaining to a deputy. So the boss kinda had no option BUT to step in.  At that point asking for the sex marker on the license has to happen, because if by some chance it HAD been ""F"" probably the story would turn out differently, or at least lead to more complicated legal arguments.  But with the ""M"" on the license? There was just no chance, at that point.  This is hardly the only similar case, either - plenty of stories coming out now of M2T who want to use the women's, don't pass, get called out, boss steps in and forbids the women's, the ""safety"" argument comes out, and the solution is to offer a unisex bathroom - which is rejected, because ""it singles me out"" or similar. It's all about the validation feels.  And so you can find people now complaining that unisex bathrooms are actually discriminatory and transphobic, because people are realizing that unisex bathrooms neatly get rid of the ""but I'll be beat up in the men's!!"" issue while not allowing that fear to push the ""...so you must let me use the women's"" argument."

He wanted to grow his hair long like young girls would. And he desperately wanted to wear dresses.  It had started when Matthew was just 18 months old and didn't stop. But Ana wasn't having it.  ""For me, it was like 'No, a boy doesn't wear girls' clothes. That's crazy. So I always put it in back. Ignore, ignore, ignore,"" Ana said.   So...you literally taught your child, systematically and forcefully, that he must be a girl.  You told him that only girls can want to wear the clothes he wants, only girls can play with the toys he wants, only girls can have the long hair he wants.  You forbade him all the things he wanted while telling him that only girl children want or have those things.   He obediently concluded that he's a girl, because YOU TAUGHT HIM SO.     ""It's a feeling as though the inside doesn't match the outside,"" said Dr. Laura Streyffeler, a licensed mental health counselor in Fort Myers who treats people who are transgender.

It's a ""knowing"" that Mommy and Daddy forbid you all the things you want, but they'd let you have those things if you were a girl.

Autogynaphilia is just the final form of male objectification of female bodies. It's not enough to see women as mere sexual objects existing only for male gratification. In order to completely objectify or own a female body, one has to become a woman themselves.

Toys should not be gender-specific.   Oh come on. This campaign has been around forever and isn't about transgender children specifically.  It has everything to do with tearing down the gender role pressures exerted on children from birth. This article highlights the aversion boys especially get for ""wrong"" toy use.   But then the article goes on to support not gendering toys in general. Sort of.    Does that make me someone who has an issue with my gender? No, it doesn’t. I just like cars and girls and boys can both like cars, as I suspect boys and girls can like dolls. I always thought there should be an American Boy Doll store to coincide with American Girl. Our society teaches young children that dolls are for girls and cars are for boys, when in fact, they can like both.   What she doesn't seem to grasp is that wouldn't solve the issue. I'm sure if this hypothetical ""American Boy"" doll were to be made it would have very different accessories and advertising than the American Girl dolls, still creating a line between what's expected of young girls and young boys."

It isn't really fair scientifically / medically to point to a specific point or trait and blame everything on that one thing.   It's a bit like saying ""this is the cheeseburger that made you fat"". There isn't a single point where an eating disorder was created.  Eating disorders are a complex disorder that have multiple factors for them developing. Predisposition for an eating disorder is a genetic factor. Also, there are many social factors that feed into the creation of disordered eating patterns. Access to food, whether physical or monetary, feeds into it as well. And I am sure an expert on eating disorders could point out many other factors into the development.  Of course being transgender can and does feed into the creation of disordered eating patterns. I've seen equal number of trans men and women having eating disorders, in the same vein as /u/deirdreofthegaians mentioned (fat in places makes passing harder).   So yeah, this study isn't a good study because they focused on one aspect of someone and said: this is why they have an eating disorder. Eating disorders don't care if you're white, black, rich, poor, cis, trans, whatever. It doesn't matter. Are certain groups more likely to have them? Definitely.    As a transgender person who did have an eating disorder, I can say gender dysmorphia factored into it occurring, but there were factors that made it spin out of control. Dieting itself isn't harmful but what happens if you are dieting and you hit a slippery slope? That is basically what happened with my behavior.   At first I cut down to 1500 calories to lose a few pounds in high school. Life got hard. Brother tried to kill himself. College got hard. Cut more. Life got harder. Cut more.   Last year, I was down to a very strict ruleset with very strict calorie requirements. I lost 25% of my bodyweight in 1.5 years. The only time being transgender factored into any of this behavior was the dieting in high school which was harmless at the time... but it still probably factored into the development."

Gender_Critical,357mlk,Eclectic58,4,Fri May 8 00:22:41 2015 UTC,"From the article:    “A 2011 study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered,” Dr. McHugh wrote in that WSJ piece, “evidence that should give advocates pause. The long-term study – up to 30 years – followed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery. The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable non-transgender population. This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.”   As an aside, I wonder how much confusion results from the fact that surely McHugh means ""non-transgender males"" when he says ""comparable non-transgender population"" and probably Sandeen means ""natal women"" when he says it.  Meanwhile according to actual religious fundamentalists, God created dinosaurs to live with humans before the Fall, they only died off in the flood. So there's really nothing ""biologically impossible"" when it comes to God creating something. The entire POINT of creationism is that you don't need to explain how anything ""biologically"" happens because it's created in one fell swoop at God's whim.  If God wants to make trans people, he can. He can put a ""woman's soul"" into a body with a penis and it doesn't have to be a ""mistake,"" maybe he wanted it that way for some reason. Maybe he's having a big laugh. Who knows.   ...but no, trans origin theory doesn't have to contradict religious fundamentalism at all. Heck, they easily can go hand in hand. As long as the ""woman's soul"" person is a proper ""helpmeet"" after getting it all sorted, it's all good. In fact recognizing that you have the soul of a ""helpmeet"" rather than a ""man"" is maybe what makes you realize you're trans.  Just don't go around saying that WOMEN can wear pants. That's where you get into trouble with fundamentalists. Worse yet, men lying down with men.   But if you're a ""woman"" inside? It's all good."

I am accepting of non conforming people, and I am androgonous. I looked non-conforming at a few times in my life when it was permissible, but women are judged harshly in employment-   It is more than- Munchhausen,  sterilizing healthy children because of a suspected LBGT status -is a human rights violation and considered sexual abuse.  I would not promote it as safe anymore than FGM makes women pure and prepares them for marriage. It is the same type of sexual mutilation directed at children with the purpose of controlling their adult sex-life  -using social & cultural excuses.  Allison Woolbert campaigned for a new law in California giving men that ID as trans the right to remove children they think are trans from their parents. What a pedophiles' dream, you can pick out children to molest and rip them from their parent's care if they don't want to perform medical experiments for the delight of a 50 year old guy's lady-boy fantasy involving children. Other nameless men and handmadens are now pushing pedo campaigns in the LBGT that were started by him, even though he is hidden from public and rumored to be gone.  Allison went after Mark, because Allison was a pedo activist that used transgender status to hide his sex offender record and start getting access to children again, this time as a 'SWJ'. When he made the 'Terf' tracker to stalk women and punish them for questioning child safety/ speaking out about the pedo activism -  at the same time collected teen information on 'trans-teens' and took the info with him. The other SWJs claimed they were locked out of his database after his sex offender status came to light.  What also made me sick was the m to trans sticking up for him having a record, and insisting, -it wasn't a problem, he was young at the time and he should get to stay- his life should not be changed..  Yea, right. He was a sexually mature man in his 30s when he served 6 years- and now, he in his 50s trying to get access to heterosexual couples' children as young as 5 to help them prepare and focus on a grand sex life that will dominate their lives- instead of education or housing concerns for adult LGBT.   I hate to say it, but for the second time in it's 'out' history, the gay community needs to kick out the pedophiles. I was real young, but was taken to the gay community as a kid by a Lesbian relative that baby-sat. I- remember the gay guys had peak- NAMBLA, and just kicked out the pedo-fetishists.

You're right that the system we live in treats women (and, indeed, anyone who isn't a man) as an inferior class, and that this is unacceptable and should be changed. However, believing that there is a spectrum of gender identity does not require or condone a system of gender-based class.

It was conducted by Wendell Johnson at the University of Iowa. Johnson chose one of his graduate students, Mary Tudor, to conduct the experiment, and he supervised her research. After placing the children in control and experimental groups, Tudor gave positive speech therapy to half of the children, praising the fluency of their speech, and negative speech therapy to the other half, belittling the children for every speech imperfection and telling them they were stutterers. Many of the normal speaking orphan children who received negative therapy in the experiment suffered negative psychological effects and some retained speech problems for the rest of their lives. Dubbed the ""Monster Study"" by some of Johnson's peers, who were horrified that he would experiment on orphan children to prove a hypothesis, the experiment was kept hidden for fear Johnson's reputation would be tarnished in the wake of human experiments conducted by the Nazis during World War II. Because the results of the study were never published in any peer-reviewed journal, Tudor's dissertation is the only official record of the details of the experiment.

They act like it's a privilege to have been taught you exist in only in relation to men, that boys are the smart ones and girls are the ones who stay in the kitchen.   As a feminist, Monica finds many of these signifiers troubling: What does it say about society that the subconscious gender cues that cast women as submissive are the ones that actually work?   It says that a bunch of sexist assholes consider submissivensss and femaleness to be one and the same. It's almost as though that's the purpose of gender...  And it says that we've gotten to the point where ""mannerisms of femininity"", and makeup are considered by genderists to make someone a woman. Now a 'real' woman is anyone who looks like a pornified version of one, and actual women who refuse to pretend they are naturally hairless below their eyelashes are considered unfeminine or manly. The fact that someone has been socialized as male and has a schlong apparently doesn't matter if they pretend they have a ladybrain, which is a sexist concept in itself, or if they put on a dress and wig.   ...most of Monica’s clients don’t want to be viewed as trans; they want to be viewed as women, because that’s how they identify. “I feel like a woman when I’m dressed,” a longtime client who calls herself Robyn tells me. “It’s not a transgender persona, it’s a female persona.”   You just can't argue with these people. Identification means nothing if it contradicts reality but you can't tell them that or you're a bigot, even though they're trying to redefine woman to mean 'pig in a wig'.  For these autogynephiles, 'woman' is a costume that they can remove at will. And gender is a playground, not a hierarchical system by which women are oppressed because of their sex. Their 'female personas'/ladyfeelz are nothing like the lives of real women, which include things like being hit on by grown men as a preteen, or perpetually being reminded your body is considered shameful and never thin or hairless enough. There are a million more examples of sex-based oppression within the Western world alone but hopefully you get the point: these people have no fucking clue what a woman is, but they're determined to redefine it to include them and their autogynephilia because they can't stand not having their delusions supported by everyone else. And (in typical male fashion) they don't give a shit if their actions harm actual women."

Gender_Critical,34pb5j,generibus,11,Sun May 3 08:48:39 2015 UTC,"I read this article recently!  Like a lot of other people here the only thing I find more disturbing than recent media portrayals of transgender children is the fact that if you dare criticize the idea you're immediately called a bigot and a monster.  Now this article was from 2004, and what I found so interesting was the article seems to be more concerned that gender identity disorder in children is being used to pathologize gender non conformity and by extension, homosexuality.  They dismiss the notion that these are transsexual children outright.  I don't think most parents of so called trans children today are looking to cure their potentially gay kid, honestly I think they're just looking for liberal brownie points, but if I'm right then they are supporting homophobia inadvertently.  This article by Alice Dreger is also very good.  She compares the difference between treating these children as transgender vs. accepting them as they are.  It should come to no surprise to anyone that she is regularly painted as transphobic.   edit: This is another good article by Alice Dreger, a little more recent."
Gender_Critical,34pb5j,repugnent,7,Sun May 3 09:51:59 2015 UTC,"The Alice Dreger material is really interesting, thank you for sharing it!  One thing I might add on the subject of helping parents of gender dysphoric kids:  I was raised by feminist parents who refused to impose sexist stereotypes on me or make me conform to gender roles, who themselves did not obey traditional roles or norms, and who staunchly supported me in my life-long gender-nonconformity...and yet I still have struggled with gender dysphoria for my entire life.  I still believed myself to be trans for most of my life.   I think my gender dysphoria is, ultimately, because who I am at my core simply is not congruent with the gendered reality of my world.    As long as the world is strictly gendered, I think people like me will exist.   This is why I worry about people trying to advise parents on how to ""fix"" or ""help"" their gender dysphoric kids.  Whether using therapy or drugs or surgery, all current approaches work under the assumption that there is something wrong with the kid that needs to be corrected.  There doesn't seem to be a model that entertains the possibility that the problem is external to the child."

Gender_Critical,34p5es,norristh,8,Sun May 3 07:03:54 2015 UTC,"What jonah Mix doesn't bring up about women is that the ""you don't do the women-things you are supposed to do ? Then you are not a woman"" is a very, very common way to separate these women from their female peers : what they women do is then NOT what proper women should do, and the category remains untouched. In fact, negatively stereotyping these women helps scare women into submission.   Turning successful and independent women into non-women is perfect to keep women under control. It's conformity or exile. And men aren't threatened by a couple rogue women because society is stable, not just a mind game."
Gender_Critical,34p5es,astrologiques,9,Sun May 3 12:53:35 2015 UTC,"HRC has commented on every stupid statement ever made by Rick Santorum (who by the way said only a couple of weeks ago that he would not attend a loved ones gay wedding). I so want them to comment on this. Surely it is momentous when a Republican politician supports the basic tenet of transgenderism -- that personal identity is more important than biology in determining who is a woman. They have totally made it their stock in trade to praise or condemn politicians based on their statements about ""LGBT"" issues. Let's hear from them!"
Gender_Critical,34p5es,BeeeboBrinker,12,Sun May 3 15:49:06 2015 UTC,"Why would it bother a patriarch that .6% of the women he dominates have penises, so long as the category of “woman” still exists to be dominated?    Exactly. I couldn't have said it better. In the last two days, two arch-conservative, anti-gay, anti-women's rights politicians have expressed full throated support of transgenderism. I hope it causes many on the left to reflect why this is happening.   Transgenderism is a highly conservative movement. It seeks to preserve the category of gender despite overwhelming evidence that it is socially constructed and used to oppress women as a class. You see it in the way that they, especially transwomen, police gender. It is very common to hear a transwoman talk about how they're more of a ""real"" woman than actual women-born-women simply because they spend more time and effort in conforming to male-created female beauty standards (wearing makeup, high heels, tight skirts, etc.)   Despite what transgenders believe, a man wearing woman's clothing does not challenge gender or patriarchy. By claiming that gender is an innate condition, they give a biological basis for patriarchy. Gender cannot be separated from culture. The gendered idea that men are naturally assertive and exhibit leadership is a cultural idea. But transgender activists claim these gender attributes are biological. An assertive woman who isn't afraid to be a leader is demonstrating masculine attributes and is secretly a man according trans ideology (and opposite to this, men who are passive and demure are really women). Thus trans ideology never truly undermines patriarchy, in fact, it reinforces it."
Gender_Critical,34p5es,OwlofMinerva,2,Sun May 3 08:58:08 2015 UTC,"I hope it causes many on the left to reflect why this is happening.   It won't.

They cannot possibly have anything in common with ""those conservatives,"" who they believe to be responsible for all the homophobia and misogyny in the world."

Gender_Critical,34mtab,radishe,10,Sat May 2 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"""I’d constantly beg for reassurance that he wouldn’t break up with me over it again. ""  This is so unhealthy, in so many ways. Not to mention, the forcing of herself to accept his feminine behavior. The way she beats herself up because she's not attracted to him is so, so, sad. It all comes from the guilt that it makes her a ""transphobe."" It's not transphobic to not want to date someone who is feminine when you prefer masculine traits on a male. It's sad that the sexism in their relationship is going over her head, she is having to bend over backwards for him and walking on eggshells, always worried he's going to break up with her, and she doesn't even realize how toxic and sexist that is. Sad."
Gender_Critical,34mtab,deadpolice,11,Sun May 3 00:23:43 2015 UTC,"AND WOW HE JUST ENDS UP BREAKING UP WITH HER AGAIN OVER A FACEBOOK MESSAGE OUT OF NOWHERE. this guy had way more problems then just being trans, she doged a bullet. He sounds fucking insane, especially with the friendzone crap."
Gender_Critical,34mtab,deadpolice,11,Sun May 3 00:28:27 2015 UTC,"Well, she found out early he was shallow and only thought of himself. Imagine the horror if she stayed and had a kid with him.  It sounds like he was looking for a co-dependent to transition with, so he has someone already, like many of these old guys that get a good job as a man [a woman with the same background could never land]-then transition in a solid job after cashing in on their careers as men.  Perhaps without a woman -servant side kick that is stuck there, it is not so fun."
Gender_Critical,34mtab,needs_moarsalt,11,Sun May 3 00:01:35 2015 UTC,"The male late transistioners with families make me sick. They're so selfish. The one's who completey abandon their families so they can ""express their gender identity"" are total scum. They completely ignore their wife and her feelings and sexuality and hapiness, and ignore their children's wellbeing. You're right, they do want a codependent, they wanna make sure the women has no backbone. The worst is the trans community who say the wifes are transphobic and bigots if they don't completely accept their new ""wife."" Doesn't matter if she has no lesbian feelings! She has to get over those transphobic bigoted feelings and get with the new program."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,deirdreofthegaians,7,Sat May 2 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"Actually....the breast cancer risk in transwomen who have grown breasts from taking estrogen is completely unknown, and is likely greater than that of a man because there's more breast tissue. If there's a history of breast cancer in the family, this isn't completely unfounded, though this person looks too young to be going for routine mammograms.  I can support mammograms for transwomen for the sake of science. We don't have any idea what the long-term risks are for transwomen taking estrogen. Maybe there is an increased breast cancer risk."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,pharmavixen,5,Sat May 2 17:52:27 2015 UTC,But money should not be diverted from women's health funds to pay for these men to get their moobs examined. There should be a separate fund for men.
Gender_Critical,34lksu,pharmavixen,2,Sat May 2 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, if that is what is happening. Where I live, we have free healthcare for everybody. It all comes out of one pot. There's no ""men's"" and ""women's"" healthcare."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,Reddwollff,3,Sat May 2 21:30:23 2015 UTC,"Even in public health system, while the funds are pooled they are allocated to specific health needs, such as screening programmes. So there is 'women' and 'male' specific healthcare within that, and what is incredibly arrogant here is that he just rocks up and expects to just take, no questions allowed. In fact, he was ""...thrilled, as the program is set up for women to access breast care..."" That wonderful validation.    He doesn't even seem to get that his choices in life do mean something in healthcare and they can't just start doing it without being clear the care is appropriate, low risk (there is X-ray involved) and cost effective. For women, a carefully planned screening programme meets the aims. For him, we don't know but it is quite clear that as always, instead of changing things like calling for research into actual breast cancer risk for that population and what could be appropriate screening for his particular situation he just whines about it being a issue when he just turns up to a service specifically to meet a women's health need and expects care to be given.   He claims he grew the breast tissue just like any other woman, when he didn't. He took something or perhaps had surgery to suppress his normal hormonal profile and added in other hormones to try and get something approaching a female one, but this is nothing like the cyclical hormonal profile of a born female. There is no acknowledgement that this changes things considerably. He cannot also extrapolate from women overall having a high risk of that kind of cancer and/or there is a history there (for women in his family) that he, as a male, has a similar risk. That is very unlikely, but that isn't even discussed."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,pharmavixen,1 point,Mon May 4 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"While it's true that he's obviously seeking women-centred health care in order to validate his identity, it's also true that there's very little research into trans health. I can support transwomen being screened like this if they are done in the context of medical research.   But yeah; no real woman goes so gleefully for a mammogram."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,deadpolice,3,Tue May 5 00:07:04 2015 UTC,"I CANNOT agree more. There are so little funds for women who need help, it makes me sick to think that these men are using it up just so they can go validate their identity. There should be a separate fund, and I don't care if they do truly need it, but cmon we all know they're gonna do it just because ""they can."""
Gender_Critical,34lksu,Astraloid,6,Sun May 3 00:32:45 2015 UTC,"My understanding is for that the risk of breast cancer for trans males is lower than women on average. Still, I am not opposed to free mammograms for men with breast tissue as long as it does not come at the cost of mammograms for women."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,pharmavixen,1 point,Sat May 2 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"Trouble is, there's no evidence for the effectiveness of breast cancer screening programs in men. It's not evidence-based."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,Astraloid,1 point,Tue May 5 00:03:44 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't it work the same?
Gender_Critical,34lksu,pharmavixen,1 point,Tue May 5 00:07:34 2015 UTC,"The mammogram would work the same as far as the actual process done on the patient. What I mean is that the effectiveness of mammograms was established by examining the images of thousands of women's breasts and determining which ones matched up to a cancer diagnosis. This information has not been gathered for transwomen. Their breasts don't develop the same way as women. Cancer in transwomen's breasts may look different on a mammogram, and we don't know if screening programs have any value in this population."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,needs_moarsalt,1 point,Tue May 5 00:15:03 2015 UTC,"And if the HRT causes cancer, like it does with women, then what?  http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/hormones-and-cancer/hrt-and-cancer  We are paying for a male's self inflicted, recreational injuries with a women's limited cancer fund."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,pharmavixen,2,Tue May 5 13:14:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with your overall point. Though if enough men take estrogen in the long-term and develop cancer, we will be able to establish a cancer link for them too. And physicians will be forced to think about the risk versus benefit, as they currently are not."
Gender_Critical,34lksu,needs_moarsalt,4,Tue May 5 21:09:05 2015 UTC,PUKE  sorry.
Gender_Critical,34lksu,needs_moarsalt,5,Sat May 2 09:13:02 2015 UTC,"Cause men don't have an unlimited sexy fund playing women.   They want men's healthcare for health-the best and only kind of insurance that covers most every male problem- and woman's healthcare to cover male sexual interests[instead of actual female humans] porn-welfare for their porn addiction.  This reminds me of a woman that got cervical cancer and was told that their top rate family insurance could not cover her 'female-problem' treatment, By time her husband got them into court, it was discovered the ins company had a special fund for that form of cancer, and the ins adjuster made a money-saving decision not to award it to them at the time, the court uncovered this-but she died and left three children behind because of the delay. Many women's cancer procedures are not covered, and shortcuts are used.   Many policies have testing and screening, but not 'treatment' of women- specific illnesses. We don't have that yet.  Using this 'set aside' fund for men's plastic surgery is a bad idea.   They should offer affordable transition insurance they can make monthly payments on, instead of taking this fund from women. Does it have to be an actual redirected stolen fund for women 's health to make this guy's fantasy of turning into a female more realistic? Or is that just another boundary to feel good about violating?"
