Its not a career for me, but for 2-3 years it allows you to build field experience and save money for awesome things like traveling! Or not -so-awesome things like paying off your student loans.  It might sound likee a scary commitment, but its a fairly easy gig!"

Outdoors,3dsb8c,Breaking_is_a_Memory,2,Mon Jul 20 07:32:21 2015 UTC,You definitely could do it.  The only knowledge they look for is that you know how/why to randomly sample and can use a dichotomous key.  I guess the one thing that causes ppl to quit early is sea-sickness.  If you are prone to motion sickness then maybe it would not be a good idea but otherwise you are probably overqualified

Outdoors,3dsb8c,ihc_hotshot,4,Mon Jul 20 07:29:09 2015 UTC,Live in city with nature close at hand. If you can get out of work and be in on the trail in an hour it won't matter too much if you work indoors. Though of course if you find your dream job that lets you work outdoors absolutely take it!
Outdoors,3dsb8c,jackskis,2,Sun Jul 19 00:16:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! Yeah you are totally right. I have also considered living in the country a bit and just commuting to work, that way I am always going home to the outdoors.   I've also considered getting a GIS certificate/diploma."

Outdoors,3dsb8c,thegooseisloose218,2,Mon Jul 20 07:24:08 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing outdoor jobs in rural areas, tend to pay a lot less than city jobs.  Also outdoor jobs that are in the best locations tend to be quite manual labor intensive.  You can't really use your chemistry degree in the back country. Biology ehh maybe. The best paying outdoor jobs are Land management positions. Something like a superintendent of a national park, or director of  city parks."
Outdoors,3dsb8c,llamacorn_787,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:07:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I could actually switch to environmental sciences instead of chemistry. I could pair that with a compressed college program to get a diploma in under a year in something environmentally related.   Money isn't that big of a deal. At the end of the day, I want a truck, a camper in the back of it, and maybe some land one day."
Outdoors,3dsb8c,llamacorn_787,2,Mon Jul 20 07:25:50 2015 UTC,Look in to summer camps or YMCA outdoors programs. They have jobs year round. You can even work your way up.
Outdoors,3dpz1z,littlemokey,2,Sat Jul 18 08:51:27 2015 UTC,"I tried to chain stitch/crochet a few. I'll put up a few pics up in the morning. For the belt I used 100', and it ended up being like a 56"" belt. It is much harder to judge the length than you think. The first chain will be 60"", the second will make it 58, the third can make it 50. It all depends on how tight you make the stitches. It gets progressively harder as you go. If you had someone who already knew had to crochet, they could probably make one fairly easily. Mine had to fold over the buckle end about 12"". It was ugly, rolled over itself instead of flat, but worked well.   I've been thinking of doing another one, but this time just a straight coil in some kind of sheath. The idea being that you could use a few feet of it, without destroy it as a belt. Haven't found a design I like. Still looking.  edit - Sorry for the potato quality. I'm still learning how to camera/interwebs. enjoy I'll post more with the necklaces sometime next week."

Outdoors,3diioe,Mocular,2,Thu Jul 16 16:25:25 2015 UTC,Cool throwing motion too! Much more natural. I was never good at chucking a frisbee like this even though I know a lot of people can.
Outdoors,3diioe,NjStacker22,-12,Thu Jul 16 18:46:17 2015 UTC,Unfortunately changing the scale of an already existing product does not make it a new product.

The edge is designed to roll off of your finger and the body design let's you get some pretty fun curves and spins on it.  The thing I liked about it was that I was able to throw it on my first try and have fun with it, but you can get really technical and sketchy with the throws once you get good with it."

Nice places to go, BTW...(if you get a spot cuz some restrict overnights to campgrounds).  If you really want ""underappreciated"" try Carrizo Plain. But it's administered by the BLM, and I think all the ones on the list are administered by the NPS, even if they aren't NPs. Anything managed by the NPS is unlikely to be underappreciated; if anything, the opposite.  Sorry to be so grouchy though...the ones above are great places."

The Alaska ski season though doesn't really pick up till springish (someone correct me if I am wrong). The lack of daylight hours and constant storms put a hamper on skiing in winter.
