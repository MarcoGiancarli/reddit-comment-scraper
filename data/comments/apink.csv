apink,3e51k3,vanxblue,2,Wed Jul 22 00:35:53 2015 UTC,It would be nice to be stuck on a island with them...one can only dream about that.
apink,3e51k3,blam1988,2,Wed Jul 22 01:25:42 2015 UTC,I hope they release a DVD with better audio for this concert because Pink Paradise DVD's audio was terrible....
apink,3e51k3,PantsDePeon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:46:32 2015 UTC,Was it really? I have yet to listen to it.
apink,3e51k3,EraYaN,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:12:18 2015 UTC,"It was ""passable"" but the video was even worse than the audio.  They should just release a Bluray already. With lossless sound not some weird low bitrate AC3 stereo like on the last dvd."
apink,3e51k3,jayeun,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:27:07 2015 UTC,I'm soooo choked. I'll be in Japan at that time and won't be in Korea until the wednesday that week. If I'd known earlier I would've booked my flights differently :( this is upsetting but I hope everyone who goes there will have a blast!
apink,3e51k3,AriesHJ,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:22:49 2015 UTC,I wish they would take visa.  I wish i had money and time to go see.  I wish it wasnt so korea restrictive as fuck.

apink,3e51k3,AriesHJ,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:54:05 2015 UTC,I dont understand the no visa or mastercard. Everywhere uses it. Most countries take it for hells sake... but they want to be different --   Just. Why

It won't be a group image/APink logo on the card is that correct? (Since the photo of the members each holder a card with one person on it.)  Anyone want to get me a ChoRong Card and ship it to Canada for me?

apink,3e2np9,Trn4mr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:42:30 2015 UTC,I assumed so. Just had to make sure since it came in a package. Must be nice. Haha.

apink,3e3psv,blam1988,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:59 2015 UTC,Thanks! Is there a link that exists online that says that? Or is it just an assumption? I'm cool with both haha

apink,3e3psv,ballisticblue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:47 2015 UTC,There was a comment saying that one member from the new groups this year was supposed to join apink... Not sure how credible that was or remember who.
apink,3e3psv,radhumandummy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:44:44 2015 UTC,It was all just a rumour back then. 2 of those are now part of CLC. https://www.reddit.com/r/apink/comments/1cxr3b/rumour_potential_yoo_kyung_replacements/
apink,3e3psv,bbomijjang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:56:14 2015 UTC,I think they just decided not to add another member. It's perfectly fine the way the group is setup so I think as time went by they just opted for the status quo. Seeing as the group's status is rising to unbelievable heights I think adding a new member right now might not be a good idea. It might ruin the chemistry of the group and theres simply no need for it. It's safe to assume that as of now there are no plans for a new member.    Also they don't need to add another bias breaker in the group T_T

She's been singing professionally for 4 years and last I check, her group is doing pretty well. Why would you let these jealous losers ruin your day? Put it this way, if you're getting haters, then you're doing something right!        P.S. If you're really bothered by this, you can tell Sunny about it. She got Chorong's back!"
apink,3e0rc3,bbomijjang,4,Tue Jul 21 02:55:03 2015 UTC,"Being completely objective, Chorong was more on pitch than two other members there (trust me), and she just barely missed the timing on the last two notes.  This is just really random and shallow, even for antis."
apink,3e0rc3,beepeekay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:00:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not a professional musician but I have a lot of background in music and my family members are music teachers and professional singers (opera).  Chorong does not have the 'best' voice but she is more on-key than most other members. In my non-professional opinion, she is most on-key next to Eunji live.   I'm not going to say who I think is the most off-key, but I think it would surprise a lot of people. Listen carefully next time they're on live."
apink,3e0rc3,notrightmeow,2,Wed Jul 22 10:41:32 2015 UTC,"upvoted for Sunny. she DID say it, haha"
apink,3e0rc3,MicaLovesKPOP,6,Tue Jul 21 07:36:58 2015 UTC,"I personally like Chorong's voice just because she has that ""soft and cuddly"" kind of vibe to it and to be honest this albums songs tone did not match with her tone and that is probably the reason why she sounded iffy during the performance since she has a high pitch and she was trying to sing low. Just my opinion :P (Hope Chorong can brush this off!)"
apink,3e0rc3,jinj09,5,Tue Jul 21 09:01:46 2015 UTC,I honestly think she has a good voice. There are just so many haters out there. Her style is more soft and light as previously mentioned. So all the haters can go and suck it.
apink,3e0rc3,blam1988,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:32 2015 UTC,I like her voice so much.  I just feel like Acube hasn't used it properly this time around.  That and she's my ultimate bias everrrrrrr

apink,3dy39v,baegjag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:40 2015 UTC,"I actually like it when they upload the interlaced source directly like this. That means I can download the file and de-interlace it myself during playback and get a nice 60fps video. If they had de-interlaced it before uploading, they would probably just done a simple decomb resulting in a 30fps video with ghosting."
apink,3dy39v,EraYaN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:47 2015 UTC,"Well it is not the interlaced source (anymore). YouTube does not support interlaced video.

MPC-HC didn't work with the GPU deinterlacing, it looks the same as the handbrake decomb filter, both are shit and cause blocks and vibrations."
apink,3dy39v,baegjag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"de-interlacing in VLC is just broken, it can't auto-detect swapped fields, and the developers don't seem to care.  Iif you are using ffdshow with mpc-hc, set it like this http://i.imgur.com/ikwC0Ut.png Use the yadif deinterlacer, set it to double framerate, and make sure to check ""process frames flagged as progressive"".  Kodi (xbmc) also does a great job of deinterlacing without having to set any special options."
apink,3dy39v,EraYaN,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:52 2015 UTC,"Mmm it is a shame that YouTube messes up the video stream then. Even ffprobe reports progressive.  Normally I don't use vlc for that and many other reasons (streaming hls with 100% cpu on 4 threads for example). BUt for this it will do if you configure it yourself.  I really don't want to use ffdshow though. I like the nvidia render, for proper interlaced content the nvidia gpu deinterlace is really the best. You know anyway to reflag all the fields? Like with ffmpeg?  EDIT:  Proper interlaced source: http://imgur.com/w1vHthR Inproper (flagged as progressive) interlaced source: http://imgur.com/8Qx9Yqy (As you can see it is not even completely interlaced, there is some color noise)"
apink,3dy39v,baegjag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked into fixing the flagging at all. In Kodi I get gpu deinterlacing, and it doesn't care if the file is progressive or not if you just enable the deinterlacing yourself, it just works."

apink,3dqojc,anonova,2,Sun Jul 19 01:46:39 2015 UTC,What is here real birth date anyway?  Her wikipedia page says 19th of July 1996 which would make that she is turning 19. http://imgur.com/nfFKaaQ (It is in Dutch but it says 18 years 11 months 4 weeks and 1 day)  Does Korea count differently? Of is the birth date wrong?
apink,3dqojc,EraYaN,6,Sat Jul 18 17:42:36 2015 UTC,"In Korea, your conception is actually your ""birthday"" (age 0), and you are automatically 1 year old when you're born. (Yes, even though it's only been ~9 months.) Your age then increases at the start of every new year, Jan 1. See this post for more detail.  Hayoung's Korean age would then by calculated by (2015-1996)+1= 20."

apink,3di1ao,EraYaN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:58:12 2015 UTC,Where did you source the 60fps version?
apink,3di1ao,Aerys75,4,Thu Jul 16 14:14:58 2015 UTC,"There's a way to convert 30fps videos to 60fps using some video editing magic which I can't begin to know how to explain. (and of cos there is a link in the description of the video to such a page teaching you how)  All i know is it takes a long time to process the conversion, and you have to add the audio back to the finished video."
apink,3di1ao,EraYaN,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"Ooh so it's fake 60 fps.   Well you can do this in almost any video editing software, it is a form of time blurring/smoothing/tweening, but not TRUE 60 fps (the camera didn't make 60 pictures per second). So it does not really add more information to the video, just more data."
apink,3di1ao,Aerys75,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"something about slowing the video down to 50% and then inserting copies of every frame into the video, doubling it. Then speed it back up and add the audio back. Saw a youtube vid about it some time back. (you can easily search for it)"
apink,3di1ao,EraYaN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"Adobe Premiere Pro can do that automatic for you. It will just take the two 30 fps frames and blur them together to get the frame in between. It gives a somewhat smoother playback but is not worth the effort/space IMHO, because you can also configure your player to do it in real time."
apink,3di1ao,Trn4mr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:46:16 2015 UTC,Is there a visible difference between fake and real 60fps? This video looks pretty good for an interpolated one in my eyes.
apink,3di1ao,EraYaN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:05:16 2015 UTC,"Actual 60fps does not have artefacts and looks crisper.  Try shooting a scene with your camera set at 60 and one at 30 and interpolate the 30fps one, you will see the artefacts. (Especially with text/smaller details) They might move weirdly."
apink,3di1ao,EraYaN,2,Thu Jul 16 23:37:50 2015 UTC,It's interpolated the same way the Apink60f channel does it. It works much better than Premiere Pro frame blending.

apink,3ddyqe,ThanatosisLawl,11,Wed Jul 15 16:12:45 2015 UTC,APink is probably the only group where all the girls are my bias lol. If I had to choose one it would have to be Hayoung though

apink,3ddyqe,thunder_fingers,8,Wed Jul 15 15:50:42 2015 UTC,It feels weird.
apink,3ddyqe,DrowsyOne,6,Wed Jul 15 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"It feels weird to me too, I think it'll grow on though. They make no efforts to transition it, just a sudden up."
apink,3ddyqe,DeliSpice,4,Wed Jul 15 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"I love the the song, but I'm not a huge transitions from Eunji to Bomi in the chorus. When I listen to the song, it feels like the song skipped a section. Just wondering if anyone else feels like that part of the song is distracting. I've listen to that section like 10 times now, and I still can't get used to it. I like both the before and after, but I feel like it's two different styles shoved into one chorus. Just personally I think the song would have flowed better with either style for the entire chorus.  Just for clarity, in the M/V it occurs at 1:27 and at 2:28."
apink,3ddyqe,apink_or_nah,5,Wed Jul 15 19:37:24 2015 UTC,"The transition from Eunji to Bomi was one of the highlights for me. Correct me if im wrong, but it sounds like a change from the minor to the major of the same key. Kinda genius if you ask me lol"
apink,3ddyqe,thunder_fingers,2,Wed Jul 15 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"same here. the chord change in the middle of the chorus is something different, and as a musician myself, i really think its cool and unique"
apink,3ddyqe,CNtotheBLUE,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:23:01 2015 UTC,"Check out the lyrics of the song, the change is supposed to represent the feeling of remembering. It's unstylistic flow is supposed to impact you suddenly just like an important memory."

apink,3dftoz,Chorongah,3,Thu Jul 16 00:10:04 2015 UTC,"I like the fact that this album has a bunch of slower songs. Perfect for when you just want to chill.  My favorite songs would have to be Flower Petal, What A Boy Wants, Remember and Track #8 (not sure what it means. Wiki says Isn't it Amazing, but not sure if that is correct).  All the songs are really good nonetheless.  I would honestly give this album a 4.5/5"

I could also be horribly wrong and it does happen.    This much is true: I fell in love with Chorong's song."
apink,3dftoz,ontherice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:07:43 2015 UTC,Which ones are written by the members?
apink,3dftoz,alastoris,4,Thu Jul 16 03:24:44 2015 UTC,What a Boy Wants - Hayoung Dejavu - Chorong Promise U - Eunji
apink,3dftoz,ontherice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:26:10 2015 UTC,Read radhummandummy's post. Dejavu is Chorong's and What A Boy Wants is by Hayoung.
apink,3dftoz,APinkIsMyLife,3,Thu Jul 16 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"My favorite is ""I Do"", it has a super catchy chorus!"
apink,3dftoz,myblindy,2,Thu Jul 16 03:55:11 2015 UTC,"Perfume: The opening bass line, I like this upbeat track. I hope they do a MV for this. It's got the famous ""머리부터 발끝까지"" line in it.  끌려: Easy listening track.  Dejavu: Chorong's track. I like the song's arrangement. Has a nice flow to it. Might be my favourite from the album.  꽃잎점: I feel like this track wouldn't be out of place if it's used as an ending theme song for a light-hearted drama.  What A Boy Wants: Hayoung's track. If the previous track felt like an ending, this one felt like an opening theme song.  I DO: It's a nice track, but it also has that generic ""hey"" soundbyte. I feel like this track is going to be like Cat, some would like it, some wouldn't.  신기하죠: A nice, slower song to round up the album.  The album on the overall has a bunch of slow to mid tempo songs, compared to their first album, UNE ANNEE, which featured mostly mid to fast tempo songs. Not including the title track, Perfume & Dejavu is currently my pick for favourites on the album.  For now, I'd give it a 3.5/5"

apink,3d7ib6,thunder_fingers,5,Tue Jul 14 03:57:07 2015 UTC,Unless she wanted to take her leave herself it's hardly an excuse to terminate her from the group because she didn't have much presence.

Currently only the  DVD1 subs have proper timing. The ripping process messed up the other two files.

apink,3cypmb,beepeekay,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they clean up the audio because there's gotta be a ton of background noise.  What you're hearing is just MR for most of the members, and usually live for Bomi and Eunji, with some switching around. For example for one song (I forget) Bomi's parts are MR and Eunji and Namjoo were the only ones live. This is probably to give the live singers a break, even Eunji for some parts in there.  I can assure you there was no auto tune at all for the live parts. Any thing that sounds like auto tune is because of singing over MR parts, e.g. Eunji's chorus in Good Morning Baby."
