peloton,3e34kn,ErynaM,11,Tue Jul 21 18:09:02 2015 UTC,"Kwiato is a good time trialist but nowhere near as good as Wiggins. Also, Wiggo had a bunch of advantages such as a long time-trial.

peloton,3e34kn,_scholar_,12,Tue Jul 21 18:39:51 2015 UTC,That's kind of the root of the discussion. His DS thinks he's too heavy to survive on the kind of climbs you get on a GT. Kwiato obviously thinks that if he ditches some weight and actually focuses on them he could. We won't know who is right until he actually tries (if he ever does) :D

Kid's 25 and he's already got an 11th place in the Tour to his name. If he changes his approach dramatically, who knows. He's a small dude with sick time trialing skills, which usually bodes well for Grand Tours."
peloton,3e34kn,Schele_Sjakie,3,Tue Jul 21 19:50:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with your comment but I also think he should wait 2/3 years. In cycling you can see that endurance for GTs takes longer to build that explosiveness for classics. So he should have plenty of time to go after the GTs. He hasn't even won a monument, although the WC counst for plenty. I think 2/3 years of classics work would be perfect before becoming a GT contender."
peloton,3e34kn,Dux89,3,Tue Jul 21 21:27:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think he needs to give up his Ardennes aspirations to become the GT rider he wants to be. In fact, if he focuses on improving his climbing, it'll only help him in Liege and LFW, and might give him a better shot at Lombardia too. He wouldn't be as strong when riding through your neck of the woods I suppose but I bet he'd trade an Amstel win for a Monument."
peloton,3e34kn,dayman_ahahaa,3,Tue Jul 21 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"We could take Valverde as an example of a rider who does well both in GT and Ardennes type one day races. Maybe he will mirror Valverde's path, but cleaner of course."
peloton,3e34kn,Schele_Sjakie,2,Wed Jul 22 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"Good point. I really think Lombardia is suited to him, but I can't remember if he did well there before. I also think Lombardia is Mollema's best chance to win a monument."
peloton,3e34kn,Dux89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:49:47 2015 UTC,He cracked last year but it was right after Worlds so maybe he was just cooked. If he improves his climbing a bit it'll be a perfect race for him.
peloton,3e34kn,Schele_Sjakie,4,Tue Jul 21 21:59:15 2015 UTC,"I do think it's amateur like that Kwiat is overcooked again from the spring season. How he, but more importantly Lefevere and Etixx, can make that mistake twice is a mystery to me.   Kwiat is very good but he;s no super man. Any rider below 25 would struggle with that program. He should focus a bit more and let races like Romandie for what it is (not per se (is that English?) Romandie but the week long WT races are really beating him down). The great versatility is also like a curse."
peloton,3e34kn,AmorphousForm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:10:41 2015 UTC,Maybe if he wasn't the WC he would have skipped the Tour for the Vuelta this year. You can't really leave the WC behind but.

peloton,3e3uc5,crwcomposer,4,Tue Jul 21 22:02:43 2015 UTC,"Ok I get this all the time. I have been using Di2 since the first generation.  It is so much more reliable than manual that its not even worth discussing.  No cable stretch, self trimming, smoother shifting, can change with one finger up or down, can change under load, tune whilst riding, cross chaining is not a problem, progammable.    The only people who I have heard speak badly of electric gears are those who have never owned them.  Every person I know with electric gears will NEVER use manual again.   Also, if you run out of batteries you are a fool as you can easily check battery levels at any time.  Also the battery last for ages."

peloton,3e3uc5,CarlCaliente,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:51:10 2015 UTC,"It would not be hard to solve, just ensure all riders have there own frequency. More of a problem is how they plan on preventing people on the roadside shifting gears for you."
peloton,3e3uc5,AmorphousForm,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:59:06 2015 UTC,"Roadside interference could definitely be a problem. Would be funny if the end game bike had processors to compute security stuff to ensure the signal was intentional.  I'm a bit of a nerd but far from an expert of the stuff, but from what I understand the most comparable technology is Bluetooth, which only has 80 something channels.  It does frequency hop, but I'd guess with close to 200 riders there would still be issues.  Seems to me they would have to get into some weird PAN stuff like ZigBee or whatever, or invent their own proprietary tech.  Cool to see though."
peloton,3e3uc5,CarlCaliente,3,Wed Jul 22 04:12:52 2015 UTC,"I have Shimano Di2 and have had zero problems. In my real world use, the battery gives between 1000-1600 miles per charge (indoor and freezing weather pushes it towards 1000).   I've ridden in freezing rain (perfect), mud, dust - nothing fazes it. The front shifting is perfect and very strong - you can shift under load (which you can't with mechanical) to the big ring."
peloton,3e3uc5,VF5,2,Tue Jul 21 22:11:59 2015 UTC,Wait you CAN'T shift underload with mechanical derailleurs? This is news to me! Have I been doing the impossible for years?

Yes, it's not that hard shifting gears while climbing on both rings simultaneously. Ever use doubletap? You can shift while braking hard going downhill (Rival on my roadbike and 105 on my cyclocross). But this maybe because I've been on mountain bike for years so I dont have problems shifting whenever and wherever I please, probably doesn't apply to majority of road cyclist who thinks they cant do it because nobody done it.

Using Gesink's VAM listed for the climb for stage 10 in Strava and the weight his team list him at (70kg), Gesink would have had to do 5.9w/kg to be 93 seconds faster (i.e. finish alongside Froome).   So if Sallet reckons that Froome weighs enough to need to do 7.04w/kg to do that time, Sallet appears to have got Froome confused with Ian Stannard. Or Andre Greipel."
peloton,3e25jo,Quirkafleeg,2,Tue Jul 21 12:05:22 2015 UTC,Gesink did most of the climb with his nose in the wind though. He made a bad tactical error at the bottom of the climb by going off so early in my opinion. He may have been able to hold Quintana's wheel to the top if he just stuck on it.
peloton,3e25jo,nnth,9,Tue Jul 21 12:22:17 2015 UTC,Gesink can't handle the changes in pace Quintana normally does. By attacking it meant that he could just ride the climb on his own pace.

Gesink being at 5.9 means that Froome was at 6.1 (93sec), given the same conditions (which is not the case because drafting). W/kg is a unit of pace, not power.  Actually, Sallet may have confused Froome with Quintana because 420W / 60kg = 7W/kg. Not the other way around."
peloton,3e25jo,teh_skrud,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:51 2015 UTC,"The think with w/kg is that it doesn't change between two riders   Well it does, because the bike weighs the same for a heavy rider or a light rider. A light rider will need higher W/kg because the bike is relatively heavier.   Also, it breaks down further when you consider that there is more going on than just work against gravity."
peloton,3e25jo,life_in_the_willage,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:14 2015 UTC,"Gesink being at 5.9   He wasn't, that's what he'd have had to do to finish 93 seconds faster.    Sallet may have confused Froome with Quintana because 420W    If he was calculating Froome's W/kg from a known power output. As that figure wasn't released, I presumed he was calculating it from climb time. In which case, as you say W/kg is a measure of pace, he is spectacularly wrong about the time gap at the end - converting W/kg to VAM and thus to climb time, 7W/kg would have put a rider over seven minutes ahead of Gesink at 5.7 W/kg, not 93 seconds."

peloton,3e25jo,d-d-d-donkey,20,Tue Jul 21 11:37:47 2015 UTC,I wrote a comment on this in another thread. They ignore the effect of drafting completely which is extremely shoddy. Ross Tucker I always assumed was a well intentioned sports scientist but he's not covered himself in glory here.
peloton,3e25jo,nnth,3,Tue Jul 21 12:08:15 2015 UTC,"This is from your post:   If Froome saves 20w for the first half of the climb then his power/kg (at 68kg) goes from 5.9 to 5.6, a big saving, and one that no doubt has an effect on Tucker's calculated VO2 max (I'm not smart enough to know by how much, sadly).   No, it wouldn't have an effect. The approximate power numbers are calculated purely from the kilometers ridden, meters climbed and the weight of the rider. They are not meant to be exact, be-all end-all kind of numbers but rather a guideline of what the average ought to be. Obviously, taking the wind / drafting will affect the actual power output but when you average the time spent by any rider leading the peloton over a 20+km climb, I'd imagine it gets to be rather irrelevant - most riders do spend most of the race drafting other people. Wind (as in, direction and speed) is probably the one single thing that makes the most difference, as it affects everyone and the formula obviously doesn't take it into account.   My guess is that Dr. Ferrari arrived at this magical formula by just fitting a function over (plentiful, varied and exact, no doubt) data to give himself a way to do sanity checking on the numbers and a way to get quick estimates of the power outputs without having to get all the data from SRM.   I'd compare it to early artillery computers - you could get a pretty darn good approximation on where the shot will land, but without accounting for air humidity, earths rotation, seagulls on the way of the shell etc you won't be able to figure out the exact spot where it will land.   On top of all that, there has been comparisons of actual SRM data and what the formula predicts, and at least Tucker confirms that it's pretty damn accurate (r = 0.86, +-5% or about +-20W error, see addendum)."
peloton,3e25jo,roveboat,3,Tue Jul 21 12:51:39 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't have an effect.     Of course it would. If you're calculating VO2max from power data, and that power data is demonstrably lower while drafting than while in the wind, then your VO2max figure will be different.    EDIT: OK, I ran the numbers for the climb. If we use a combination of DrF method but factor in the drafting for the first part of the climb and use Ross Tucker's lower end guess (6.3w/kg) for power, in his words, in the second half of the climb (in reality it was 14.30 out of 41 minutes, closer to a third), then we arrive at 5.84, which is pretty close to the real figure of 5.78 shown by Froome's power meter."

If you're calculating VO2max from power data, and that power data is demonstrably lower while drafting than while in the wind, then your VO2max figure will be different.   Again, this formula models the average, it's not a simulation. I'm still of the opinion that on average, most riders draft for most of the climb.   Also, I was wrong before - DrF method doesn't involve the weight of the rider at all, it's a function of VAM and the gradient of the climb. I'm actually really curious to see someone more into this stuff go through the actual data, to see how the estimate is that much off, as misestimating the weight of Froome could not have been a factor."

Other variables play into it, but this is formula trying to find the most fundamental connection there. What other assumptions are there inherent in the formula?  Again, I'd guess this formula has been arrived to by fitting a function on a bunch of very good data (where all the variables we measure now are known) and it's not claiming to prove or tell us anything really about the connection itself, but just to give us an approximation. A bit like Newtonian mechanics is an approximation - it's great up to a point but at some point it falls apart and then you take out QM/actual power meters.

I mean, if we'd get (let's say) the Champions League finals data. Some football players would perform wildly better than the other. Would that mean they're doped? Or would it just mean they're fitter?   Or what if Froome's data says he performed less than Quintana, but was just smarter on particular places of the ride. Would that mean Quintana was a doper? Or would it just say he made a poor choice where Froome was a smarter rider.  Long story short; I can't understand how data would vouch for or against any statement and I can't see how these data-dumps help out.   (And, while I'm ranting anyways. Messi is arguably the best football player of the world. Or Ronaldo or whoever. Not going in that argument now. But I never ever heard anyone say he was a doper. I mean... meh.

peloton,3e25jo,isthisdutch,21,Tue Jul 21 12:19:31 2015 UTC,There is no real way to definitively prove that he hasn't doped with data like this but it does go some way to disprove some of the arguments out there at the moment that are using some abnormally high estimates for his power figures as a suggestion that he's doping. The figures released today are much lower than the figures people were assuming in those arguments.
peloton,3e25jo,Kaepertortoise,12,Tue Jul 21 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"It doesn't prove whether he is doping or not. It does prove that he isn't doing something superhuman.

If legitimate data showed that sort of thing, there would be reason to suspect that the rider was doping. However, there'd still be a chance that they just happen to be a 1 in a billion athlete.  People had been looking at estimates of Froome's power data and arguing that it put him in that questionable status. The data that Sky released shows that he's actually performing at a completely reasonable level.  So it's not that the data proves that he doesn't dope, it just proves that you can't make the claim that based on his power numbers his performance is suspicious."

peloton,3e25jo,SantaSCSI,8,Tue Jul 21 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"It's widely agreed upon by sports physiologists (the experts) that doing 7 Watts/kg for any sustained amount of time (read: more than ~10 minutes) is not humanly possible unless you're doping. It's ""drawing a line in the sand."" Many physiologists work backwards from there, saying things like ""You can't do 6.7 Watts/kg for more than 30 min without doping"" etc etc, and so the argument among experts is where we draw these performance ""lines in the sand.""  But it's not like these figures, formulas, and statistics are complete hogwash. They're the product of people with degrees in kineseiology and sports medicine who have worked within cycling for a long time. These people want to improve the way we use data to catch cheats. Although some of them are total morons with an axe to grind, others are just working for the good of cycling."

Some football players would perform wildly better than the other. Would that mean they're doped? Or would it just mean they're fitter?   It's much easier in cycling because cycling is pretty much all about one thing: the ability to use as much oxygen as possible (aka VO2max which translates into more power which translates into more speed). Thus, this data will give us an insight into that exact thing. In football, there is no such thing to measure - the player who has the most stamina or is the fastest is not the best player. There is no objective measure for quality of a pass, but we can measure the power output of the cyclist and see whether it matches all the data we've gathered on the limits of human performance so far.   (note: this is a simplifcation, obviously tactics/muscle type etc do play a role in cycling but on average, the guy who puts out most power per kg will win.)"

peloton,3e25jo,pielad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:53 2015 UTC,Faster seems possible but power output of human muscles won't keep going up infinitely so there is a currently estimated limit on what humans can do.

peloton,3e25jo,nkassis,2,Tue Jul 21 22:32:53 2015 UTC,There are apparently calculations that physiologists say are out of the realm of possibility for humans.

peloton,3e25jo,donrhummy,5,Tue Jul 21 14:15:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you absolutely have to include the adjustment.   Stages say that the osymmetric rings over-read by 4-5% (link is below). At 5% it's 5.83 (rounded) W/kg. 4% error is 5.89 (rounded) W/kg. That's using 67.5 kg as his weight.   I guess it also depends when you are weighed, as weight fluctuates a lot in a day."

peloton,3e25jo,madindehead,3,Tue Jul 21 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"It seems quite reasonable that Stages' quoted 4-5% could be amplified for a pro rider that's putting out far higher power for longer periods than most of their customers.

Of course they could be lying, but if they're lying about that they might as well be lying about all of it."

US Postal used to batten down the hatches and repeat the 'never failed a test' line over and over and come across super aggressive to anyone that questioned it.

I have nothing against Chris personally or as an American rooting for Tejay. If Tejay comes back next year and starts dropping people on climbs, I will be hollering at BMC to release his data.

Once GCN had a question to all pro rider: What would you be if you wouldn't be a pro cyclist. Gesink answer: A farmer. So simple :)  Mollema is never nervous, he always makes jokes in interviews but is a really introvert person according to his team mates.   Also you guys are pronouncing Gesinks name really well. It's still not with the guttural Dutch G but that's impossible for non dutchies. This is as close as you can come! ;)"
peloton,3e2xau,Schele_Sjakie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"Is it a guttural G? I can do it, I promise. Next time we talk about him, I will. Never really knew if it was Hey-Sink or (K)Hey-Sink. I'm on the case."
peloton,3e2xau,Schele_Sjakie,2,Tue Jul 21 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"Here ya go!. The First one is a typical west-dutch accent (hollandsch, so a pretty harsh G). And the second one is more soft, a southern style which has resemblance with the Flemish G.  Almost every English commentator says Hey-Sink, but the first letter isn;t even close to that. The G is very hard to pronounce to foreigners.   A little fact for you, I know you like these historical thingies. In WW 2 the Dutch resistance had a password. People at the door were asked to pronounce 'Scheveningen'. Only a Dutchie can do this, no German in the world can pronounce that. So that was the thing to know whether someone was German or Dutch."
peloton,3e2xau,Schele_Sjakie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:23 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing with pronunciation of foreign names/words though‚Äîtypically the unwritten rule that most people follow (generally without even knowing that they're doing it) is: pronounce the word as close to the correct way to pronounce it, using the sounds that exist in your own native language.  For instance, when I say Nairo Quintana on the podcast, I say it pretty much exactly the way I would in a Spanish conversation, except without a rolled R, because that's the closest approximation you can give using sounds that exist in English. I don't say Nairo Kwintana (like Sean Kelly does) because in Spanish it's pronounced ""KIN-tah-nah."" That hard K sound exists in English, so I can say it. The rolled R doesn't, so I don't.  I'm fully capable of rolling my Rs but if I did, I'd kind of sound like a tool. Like if I say Pierre Rolland with the French Rs... again, I'd kind of sound like a tool. So while I might try for the legit GHesink sound just to see if I can do it, it's not what I would normally do anyway to be honest, because if I went around rolling my Rs on Spanish names I'd sound toolish to many people."

peloton,3e2xau,huloca,2,Tue Jul 21 21:52:30 2015 UTC,"I'm actually loving it, but that's because I appreciate the stage-by-stage battle more than most.

peloton,3e2v9n,Ausrufepunkt,12,Tue Jul 21 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel that it boils down to the unique nature of the sport where you are constantly working with and against your opponents. There are so few sports out there like cycling where working with an opponent is beneficial to both parties. It's something I've found in amateur USAC racing. I've gotten friendly with some of the guys I compete against, but knowing each other and being able to attack together to take a lead on the field makes the sport more fun. There are guys I won't ever try to breakaway with or bridge because I have learned they will not pull for me at all (which is totally fair, and a smart tactic for them, I just won't jump their wheel because as soon as they know I'm there they pull behind me). Basically the unwritten rules get enforced through reputation. If you are known to be someone who will work well at the front of a group and not take out wheels, or throw bows etc., then that helps the unwritten rules become enforced. Guys who build bad reputations won't get help near the front."
peloton,3e2v9n,emersonthird,5,Tue Jul 21 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Now I think about it, all popular team sports is a one-team vs one-team match."

peloton,3e2v9n,ottopivnr,15,Tue Jul 21 21:37:56 2015 UTC,"Through much of the history of cycling, there have been dominant riders in the peloton. they used to call this man the 'Patron'. LA might have been the last of them, as he was infamous for being a dick to riders who didn't follow omerta, or other rules of the peloton. Probably the easiest way to see enforcement is to recognize that a given rider is not allowed to get into the breakaways. In addition to team loyalties, there are also some national loyalties, as many of these riders will also be riding together, regardless of team affiliation, at worlds or in the olympics. plus lot of riders have moved from team to team over the course or a career. this makes for a pretty cohesive group, that will have a traditional sense of the sportsmanship that is particular to cycling. It doesn't take many days of simply not being allowed to get into a break (by constantly being shut down by other teams or riders) to get the hint that you've done something wrong."

peloton,3e2v9n,lonefrontranger,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:44 2015 UTC,"in the TDF it's usually an experienced, often older rider who is usually but not always high up in GC, if not the maillot jaune.  Jens / Spartacus have both filled this role in the post-LA years, but now that Jens is retired and Fabian is out, I'd suspect it's more someone like Valverde, 'Berto or even Voeckler (don't laugh, he's been around forever)."
peloton,3e2v9n,blandwhiteguy,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:52 2015 UTC,I think it can sometimes be deferred to the leader as well. I remember Matthews being a little overwhelmed when he was in pink for the stage at Bari that got neutralised.
peloton,3e2v9n,lonefrontranger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:07:25 2015 UTC,yeah totally race leader has a lot of influence for sure.  my take from listening to some of Vaughters' stories is Padrone / Patrone can be a whole other level... they're the ones who talk down the brash young things if they're being asshats and put the ixnay on attacking through feed zones etc... of course he's heavily influenced by the LA years too so take that for what it's worth.
peloton,3e2v9n,Watoskyv,8,Wed Jul 22 04:31:54 2015 UTC,"The cycling world is pretty small, you don't want a bad reputation with guys you have to ride together with for the rest of the year. I also heard the veterans, guys like Cancellara, get a lot of respect, and they make sure the younger ones know the boundaries."
peloton,3e2v9n,bitchstorm,13,Tue Jul 21 15:43:08 2015 UTC,The reason there is an easy ride into Paris is because it is a flat stage and it is usually impossible for anyone to make up enough time on the flat stage to challenge the person wearing the yellow jersey. The sprinter teams will chase down any breakaways because the real prize and  excitement of that day is winning the sprint on the Camps-Elysee.
peloton,3e2v9n,Jevo_,6,Tue Jul 21 15:45:34 2015 UTC,"I heard an Italian rider, to spite Lance Armstrong, attacked during the ride to Paris when Armstrong's team was celebrating and drinking champagne."

It was well known that Armstrong had used Ferrari as a ""trainer"", this caused Armstrong to call Simeoni a liar. In the 2004 Tour de France Simeoni raced. On stage 18 he tried to join the breakaway, but Armstrong followed him, causing others to chase. Basically nullifying any chance Simeoni had of getting into a breakaway. To retaliate Simeoni attacked over and over again on the way to Paris on the final stage. As we know, Simeoni was 100% correct about what he said about Ferrari."

peloton,3e2v9n,RyanMTB,9,Tue Jul 21 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"This year might prove to be different thanks to time bonuses. If you have a team capable of a TTT and another team wanting to hold onto their position or to move up, you could see echelons form.   Here's an example:  Tejay Van Garderen is 22 down on Quintana for yellow because Froome crashed out. BMC is a better TTT team. Saxobank want to get Sagan a win and they know he can't beat Griepal in a true sprint. Saxobank are also a decent TTT. BMC and Saxobank see that Quintana and Griepal aren't paying attention in a heavy crosswind and surge at the front and echelons form with a front group of 25 riders including Contador, TVG, and Sagan. With this move, Contador would move to the podium and TVG into yellow and Sagan just wants to win the stage. If it's mostly Saxobank and BMC in the group, then there would be an understanding to give Sagan the win and TVG bonus seconds (maybe Sagan and TVG would end yo attacking each other to contest the bonus seconds or stage win) the group could be able to spread the gap to last in Paris and thus move two GC riders up including a new Yellow Jersey, solidify the Green Jersey and give it a stage win, and put another on the podium. If this situation were to happen, then I can say with certainty  that the 2015 ride into Paris will be long remembered for generations."

peloton,3e2v9n,MattWithTwoTs,4,Tue Jul 21 20:17:05 2015 UTC,Depends how close it is between 1st and 2nd in GC I guess. What's the closest it's been before the last stage? If it was all still to play for and only a few seconds difference I can see how the 2nd place GC guy and his team would want to snatch it. Would the no attacking rule really be the case even then?
peloton,3e2v9n,TurtleRecall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:49:38 2015 UTC,"Its a sprinters stage. I doubt a true sprinter has ever won yellow. Theres going to be attacks, for those who want to win a stage, but the riders attacking arent going for yellow. Itll end in a bunch sprint, and all the yellow contenders will finish in the same group. Just like they do on all flat stages.

Michael Hutchinson did a test on an outdoor velodrome between a Cervelo S5 and a more conventional bike (Canyon SLX)  The S5 was something like half a K ahead of the Canyon at the same wattage after 10 minutes. At four hours, you're talking something like 12 kilometers ahead at the same power output.  It's not scientific, of course, but it does make me think that the latest aero developments (especially wheels) would make a huge difference on a fairly flat stage where the S5 would be appropriate.  http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/how-much-faster-is-an-aero-bike-video-176312"

Stages like this with medium mountains suit him well if he can get in a breakaway. He also has a good sprint, so he doesn't need to get away on his own, except if Sagan is in the group of course."
peloton,3e06lg,alreadycalledit,9,Tue Jul 21 08:57:43 2015 UTC,Guessing Sagans extra weight had something to do with the extra pull down.  IAM was peddling like mad and Sagan just sat there for most of it.

I do wonder about the benefits of the supertuck. He expended a bit of energy jumping off and onto the saddle throughout it. Would it outweigh the extra energy one would have to spend recouping the ""losses""?"
peloton,3e06lg,tspek,9,Tue Jul 21 04:24:40 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised how effective it is if you've never tried it.
peloton,3e06lg,Minkelz,9,Tue Jul 21 05:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, you can actually watch the speed ticking up on the garmin from going into the tuck. Aerodynamics are crazy important at high speeds."
peloton,3e06lg,hipsterhank,3,Tue Jul 21 11:10:30 2015 UTC,"I've never tried it and likely never will, because I'm a fraidey-cat. I've only ever done one true mountain climb/descent, Mt. Lemmon in Tucson (hell of a ride, btw), and the descent terrified me. It was pretty windy, giving you an awesome tailwind until the next switchback when you turned into a headwind, but the 1.5 seconds that you were going through the turn the wind blew me almost all the way across the road. At one point I had to stop and catch my breath because I think I'd forgotten to breathe for about two minutes."

peloton,3e06lg,limonenene,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:49 2015 UTC,Just tuck from saddle and with your hands on brakes. Wait a while and then sit up. You'll slow down noticeably even without speed sensor. That's a safe way to test it :)

peloton,3e06lg,Grumpy_Cunt,8,Tue Jul 21 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"I use it (on straight, smooth roads that I know well, not on ANYTHING like that descent) and you'd be amazed at how much speed you pick up by getting that small. If your speed would level off at, say, 70ish then dropping down on the top-tube will add 10kph, no problem. It's really effective."
peloton,3e06lg,nonflux,2,Tue Jul 21 07:28:52 2015 UTC,"I sometime overtake riders which are peddaling when on descent. So I say its super effective. You just need to sit on top tube let the legs rest. I did Portalet spain side descent only in tuck. You get that extra grip thanks to lower gravity, but bike gets less stable and feels weird."

Here is my translation:   Sagan, hats off! A warior. That's the most fitting word. Psychologists, might say that the second place is the most painful - just one small step and he might have landed first... Peter Sagan already earned five second places. But that's what makes him so admirable. In spite of bad luck and lacking a help or support he wakes up every day and gives his best. And that's the secret behind a success - don't give up, don't get discouraged and always give what you have. Peter, we are proud of you. You are making great reputation for our country.

peloton,3e15j2,hairypolack,5,Tue Jul 21 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"I hope to see Quintana win a stage or make Froomey work for it. It's amazing to see Nairo climb.   Polka Dots hopefully to Purito. I hoped to see more from Tommy V, but Purito would look good in the climbers jersey.  Sagan for green. I want him to win a stage too. One of my favorite riders but I wish he rode for a different team."
peloton,3e15j2,emersonthird,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly I hope Greipel wins the Champs-Elysee but Sagan takes the green in second. I like both riders a lot and they reflect a lot of the sport. Greipel is the guy who has a whole team behind him in support and they have pulled off some great work for him. Sagan is the guy who can go out effectively solo and do just as well (or as the standings show, better) as Greipel. Basically I like seeing Cav whine on twitter about how nothing is his fault."

For us cycling fans it's great to see someone like Contador give it a go, but given that the Tour greatly overshadows the rest of the cycling season from an exposure standpoint, it makes sense to be as fresh as possible for the Tour."

peloton,3e15j2,Mattho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:26 2015 UTC,Would team mountain classification be interesting enough? Similarly to team classification so teams with less riders are not at disadvantage.
peloton,3e15j2,L_Dawg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:19 2015 UTC,"The Giro has a few crazy classifications like that (possibly not that one specifically) but to be honest, no one really cares about them. I don't think its necessarily a bad idea but since no one specifically targets the even the current KoM jersey coming into the tour at the moment, Im not sure whether teams would actually go for it."
peloton,3e15j2,HighSilence,4,Tue Jul 21 21:48:29 2015 UTC,"Some questions from a new fan:  How did the breakaway get 20 minutes in front yesterday?! They didn't mention it in the coverage I saw. I assume the GC teams knew there were no threats there so they let them go. 20 minutes seems crazy!  What is the grupetto?  For the big mountain stages, how far behind do the sprinters typically finish? All the coverage is on the GC contenders and any breakaways...I only watch the stuff uploaded on cyclinghub but cav, kittel, greipel, etc are nowhere to be seen in those videos. How far back are they finishing? I assume they are suffering pretty badly and just saving themselves for Paris?"
peloton,3e15j2,tbayjibber,6,Tue Jul 21 14:49:24 2015 UTC,You are exactly right. There were no GC threats in the breakaway so the main contenders can let it get that much time without having to worry about their GC positions. Pantano was the best placed rider in the break and only moved up to 16th on GC even with gaining 20 minutes. The grupetto is the term for the large group of riders off the back (usually in mountain stages). Often full of sprinters and other non-climbers.  Somewhere between 20-30 minutes back. There is a time cut which is determined by a percentage of the winner's time so they can't just soft pedal the whole stage. I've read somewhere that the grupetto often rides a steady tempo up the climbs and then goes crazy of the descents and flats. But yes in regular TV coverage you're unlikely to see a sprinter cross the line on a mountain stage.
peloton,3e15j2,MetalMrHat,3,Tue Jul 21 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"Very thought provoking.  Edit: Ok now you've posted them. The peloton had no interest in chasing, preferring to save their energy over chasing a big breakaway down.  The Grupetto is a peloton of riders who've fallen out of the back of the main bunch, they work together to finish inside the time limit. Full of sprinters, injured riders and workhorse riders who are done for the day.  The sprinters will aim to finish inside the time limit, otherwise they don';t care."
peloton,3e15j2,HighSilence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"Hah, so I can't post from my work computer, but I can from the reddit app on my phone. I submit part of a post from my phone, then edit in the remaining message on the work computer which can successfully post--but only edits. Odd, right?  Thanks for the answers, so the first one about the breakaway, I understand the logistics for the other teams to not bother, but 20 minutes was the biggest time gap I've seen. I assume it's just that the breakaway got out pretty early and slowly built that gap. Then when I flipped on the cyclinghub video of the end of the stage, they had a huge gap built up."
peloton,3e15j2,MetalMrHat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:29 2015 UTC,"Once they know the break isn't going to be caught, so long as no one in it isn't close on the GC, it hardly matters if they win by 5 mins or 20 mins. 20 mins is a big gap though. Sometimes the gap gets larger than anticipated though, Stuart O Grady ended up in the yellow jersey after gaining close to 20 mins from breakaway win."

Probably Thomas, just because he'll end up getting fried for Froome  The KOM jersey will probably go to Froome, but I could see Fuglsang pursuing it, and winning, just because he's out of the GC picture.  Best stage was the cobbled stage, Tony Martin's attack was incredible.   FDJ should be way better. They have a very good sprinter in Demare, and obviously a very good climber in Pinot, and don't have much to show for it. In particular, Demare has shown himself to be nearly as good as Degenkolb, but he has just has not been anywhere during the tour.

It remains to be seen, but Geraint Thomas is always in service of Froome, so that might get him out of the GC top 10. And Barguil without a doubt. I think Rodriguez. He's got quite a gap, and I don't see Fuglsang taking it away from hin. Best stage was stage 10 for me. Froome might have won the Tour already, and it has been one of the few ""open"" stages where Sky wasn't only defending. IAM, Cofidis, Bora and Bretagne. IAM having the most riders, they're coming for most invisible. That said, Bretagne-Seche has far too good of a team for being this invisible.   Looking forward to the Alpe d'Huez!"

Stage 2 was a disaster for them.  Barguil seems the only likely candidate to fall out of the top 10 at this point. Thomas and Valverde might be asked to blow themselves up one day but even then they have a significant time buffer to play with.  Polka dot... Froome probably? I kind of like Pinot for it but I still have him picked for alpe d'huez so he may play it safe till then. I think Purito will hunt for another stage rather than KoM points, I'm just not sure the jersey appeals to him that much. Lack of anyone really hunting for the points = GC rider winning by default imo.   Best stage was... I dunno, 14 maybe? I don't think there has really been all that many exciting stages. Racing-wise the TdF has been a bit flat.  IAM? More like MIA. Talk about a poor performance.  I am really looking forward to the remaining stages. Think we have a good mixture of profiles and finishes that suit different riders. I am quite excited for stage 18, I always enjoy a major descent close enough to the finish to make a difference, and a final dash up Lacets de Montvernier should be both beautiful to watch and fun"

He just has to be in a breakaway for Stage 19 (to finish) and Stage 20 (even if caught before L'Alpe d'huez) Stage 13 - You didn't know whether the break was going to make it, whether the peloton would catch and, if they did, would they be able to sprint at the end With the exception of Dan Martin's few podium places Garmindale have done nothing.

Seriously speaking, I don't know- not a big battle so far. Say what you want about it, but Stage 10 was very entertaining- a brutal climb at the end of a flat-ish day. Scenery-wise, Stage 14 was gorgeous and the airport arrival was rather neat!

peloton,3e15j2,Ham_Authority95,8,Tue Jul 21 05:40:10 2015 UTC,"What was the best stage so far?   Definitely Stage 16! I love the descent into Gap; it never fails to bring drama and excitement to the Tour. Downhill attacks also look way cooler than uphill ones. Seeing Sagan and Nibali race down that final section is the reason I watch cycling.  I think part of the reason I love descending so much is that it brings another variable into play that is otherwise discounted; fear. Some cyclists are completely fearless and will take massive risks on a descent. Others will play it safe because they're worried about hurting themselves or crashing and losing time. Descending skills are most often limited by mental barriers, rather than physical or technical ones, which is something that you can't say for sprinting, time-trialing or climbing."
peloton,3e15j2,Goldcobra,9,Tue Jul 21 05:16:55 2015 UTC,"I think Quintana will be super aggressive and might win a stage(or two!). Both him and Valverde will trade off some attacks. Will it be enough to drop Froome? We'll have to see, but I wouldn't count on it. Froome has looked strong all Tour, and I don't see that changing until maybe stage 20, when it'll be too late anyway.   Barguil will drop from the top-10, but only because Bardet is desperate for the top-10 slot himself.  Joaquim Rodriguez has a great shot at it, only 9 points away. Froome will be in energy-saving mode until the final climbs, so Purito could punch his way to the top.  Jesus, that's hard to pick. The entire first week was crazy fun. Also, I don't think I'll forget watching Sagan fly his way down that descent today.  Lampre. Didn't even notice them in the break until Plaza won today."

peloton,3e1vwe,big_al11,6,Tue Jul 21 11:34:01 2015 UTC,Personally I would say Nibali. I know he hasn't been on form this tour but the skill set he has on cobbles and descents makes him a spectacular rider
peloton,3e1vwe,Dux89,3,Tue Jul 21 10:20:25 2015 UTC,"Do you mean based on their riding style? If so, look for riders whose results don't depend on them having a team to discourage attacks‚Äîi.e. Alberto Contador. On the other side of the coin you have (had, I guess) Bradley Wiggins, who needs teammates to keep a high pace and reel in attackers on the climbs so that he can wear down the lower endurance riders and keep them from jumping clear, and then gain chunks in the TT."
peloton,3e1vwe,WiWoWard,4,Tue Jul 21 11:51:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say Contador, he basically won the Giro without teammates. Valverde is pretty good too without his team, who have to ride for Quintana. Also Nibali if he got his confidence back like yesterday."

If it's down to raw talent and having no helpers then I feel tempted to say Contador after the Giro as much as it pains me to say."
peloton,3e1vwe,PeterPaprika,17,Tue Jul 21 09:18:29 2015 UTC,"What? Tejay has his entire team around him whenever he can. Then if it gets hard, he is alone and he can't keep up."

peloton,3e1vwe,oojemange,2,Tue Jul 21 10:37:11 2015 UTC,"He gets away with it because of the sky train doing the work for him, if that wasn't around he wouldn't be able to follow the attacks himself."

peloton,3e1nk7,johnjackjoe,14,Tue Jul 21 13:01:02 2015 UTC,Because his job is chasing the breakaway all day long keeping the leash short for the Giant-Alpecin sprinters.

peloton,3dycch,lmm310,-9,Tue Jul 21 03:19:19 2015 UTC,"I never liked Tejay a lot, I think I like him even less now.  ""Some riders were definitely taking some big risks. I was just trying to stay on the wheel that I was on and then a lot of riders were trying to come over the top and take over positions, and they were just taking way too big a risk,‚Äù van Garderen said. ‚ÄúThat saw Geraint Thomas take a fall because it looked like Warren Barguil took him out. I‚Äôm just glad to have made it down safely.""  Let's just review some overtakes on the descent   Barguil overtakes Contador and Tejay at 2:29. He has position on Van Garderen after the corner. Van Garderen is looking to overtake the riders in front of him, he's drifting a bit to the right starting at 2:57, and when they enter the corner (3:05) Tejay is all the way to the right. During the corner he overtakes both Quintana and Barguil on the outside. You can't actually see it on the video, but he leaves the corner (3:17) in front of both riders and is even fighting for the position with Gesink, who was also in front of him, by pushing him to the left.  Gesink doesn't allow it and recovers his position in the next corner (3:20), while Quintana is also overtaking Tejay on the other side of the road. At 3:40 Barguil overtakes Van Garderen on the outside. He gains position and is sitting on Gesink's wheel (3:46). In this gif you can see Van Garderen looking at Barguil after he has overtaken him and accelerate even though Barguil is already on Gesink's wheel and Tejay has lost the position.  3:50 it looks like Barguil is bumped, supposedly by Tejay. At 4:02, as Barguil takes Thomas down, look who it is overtaking both Quintana and Gesink. Yeah... Tejay. He almost took Quintana down too, but Nairo was still entering the corner so he managed to avoid the crash.   ""Just trying to stay on the wheel."" Fuck you Tejay."

And prejudice? Really?   Anyways, they are both at fault. No way should Barguill have had such speed regardless of what happened. Thomas was correct to say that position fighting on a descent is reckless   And I never said Tejay was more at fault than Barguil, or that Barguil wasn't the main culprit. My problem is with TvG saying that others ""were trying to come over the top and take over positions"" while he ""was just trying to stay on the wheel"". That is not true, as shown by my post.

peloton,3dycch,AstralThundercunt,14,Mon Jul 20 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"The TVG - Barguil ""collision""  First, sorry for the shit quality (if you have RES open the link for a bigger version). Credit to /u/cppn02 for the video, here: https://youtu.be/2gU4SVH5xeA?t=226 (and see /u/dksprocket lower down who also spotted that while I was using my Paint skills :x)  So from this video, at 3:51 we clearly see TVG giving a nudge to Barguil, from the rest of the footage what I gathered is that TVG moved to the right to overtake Quitana (which he did) all the while battling with Barguil, in doing so Barguil finds himself too much to the right coming into the corner with too much speed and very clearly having missed the breaking point.  While Barguil is not blameless, I think the situation was a lot more nuanced than many comments said on the Live Thread. More so, this view of the incident is very close to what Barguil explained in French after the race (Here bottom of the page: http://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme-sur-route/Actualites/Warren-barguil-percute-geraint-thomas-et-l-envoie-contre-un-poteau/575649), to paraphrase him : ""I'm so sorry, TVG push me before the turn and I lost grip on my rear breaks""."

Still, it didn't seem much, and it's totally Barguil's fault in my opinion.  It was a difficult curve to the right, and since he was on the very right side of the road (thus, the worst trajectory) he had to know he should be going a LOT slower than the guys on the left.  Reckless move for sure."

These guys know the descent is dangerous at best.  I don't think that ""because this LE TOUR"" is a good answer.  Edit to add that Geraint Thomas even said in his post race interview that he didn't understand why the riders couldn't get in one line."
peloton,3dycch,0_0_7,3,Mon Jul 20 20:28:25 2015 UTC,Look like they were playing chicken for position and Barguil thought he'd win. Still don't see that he didn't have time to brake. It'd mean giving up position to TvG so he bombed it and took out G. Barguil was messing with his rear brake adjustment after G went off too.
peloton,3dycch,vestergaard92,5,Mon Jul 20 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thoughts, Barguil could easily have breaked earlier and taken the corner right after TVG."

This comes after Barguil trying to pass Van Garderen in the previous turn: link  (thanks /u/HerHor for pointing out the clip)  Edit: here is a video with french commentary"
peloton,3dycch,lonefrontranger,7,Mon Jul 20 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"on multiple reviews from different angles... the only reason I think TJ changed his line really was to avoid contact with Barguil. And he barely changed, it's just a very subtle straightening of his apex. And at this speed on this corner it's sketchy to change line at all for sure but seems maybe he was more trying to avoid cutting Barguil off and creating a worse incident.  Barguil is doing the very subtle pro racer version of your all too common Cat 4 criterium racing scenario where some overcaffeinated nutbar deliberately charges the inside apex of a corner trying to move up while yelling ""inside inside!!"" and expecting everyone else to give them room to pass. It's a pretty douche move unless you're on dirt wearing pads and a fullface helmet and I cordially loathe anyone who tries it on the road. when I was an official I would happily warn and/or relegate the more obnoxious offenders."
peloton,3dycch,lonefrontranger,7,Mon Jul 20 21:56:29 2015 UTC,"okay, here's the thing.  The overtaking rider has the responsibility to take a safe line. Coming past TVG in that way was a risk, that he knowingly took.   Granted this is a bit of a grey area, but it's the rider in the rear that has the burden of responsibility to close / go through gaps in a safe manner.  This is something that I, as a current road racer and former official have had to point out to riders more than once to defuse arguments. I've had to relegate riders for making chancy passes that cut someone off and caused a crash.  IMO this wasn't a super blatant chancy pass, but Barguil knew he was taking a risk by coming up under TVG in this way.   Cutting off the apex / barging the inside line to make a ""block pass"" is kind of a punk move in road racing, really. When it works (dual slalom / BMX mostly) it's heralded as a ballsy move.  In road racing at ~70kph + on tarmac?  yeah, it's borderline being an asshole."

peloton,3dycch,lonefrontranger,5,Mon Jul 20 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"not from the video footage, Barguil comes charging up on the inside of the apex, he's trying to cut inside to the right to make the pass, and overcooks it which is why he throws an outrigger, not because of any contact - he's feeling his rear tire starting to let go. TVG goes a tiny bit left mainly to avoid slamming the door on Barguil. Watch it again."
peloton,3dycch,Weale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:18:41 2015 UTC,"Not at all. Van Garderen literally pushes him out of the line. After the contact, Barguil said that he couldn't brake for 1 or 2 seconds, he wasn't attempting to overtake him, he just couldn't slow down. Before watching the gif I would have put 100% of the blame on Barguil but he might be right after all."
peloton,3dycch,danefalberg,5,Mon Jul 20 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why he couldn't brake for 1-2 seconds though. How can it take a professional bike racer 1-2 seconds to find his brake lever? Honest question because I haven't seen the explanation Barguil gave (and I don't speak French anyway), why can't he brake?"

peloton,3dycch,yjupahk,5,Mon Jul 20 16:40:52 2015 UTC,"Last year he was looking despondent and the meejah reaction to that turned a momentary dip in form into a bit of a nightmare. This year he's (rightly, IMO) focusing on the positives. He has no near rival for green.  He should look to up his classics game for next season if he's to fulfil his vast potential, mind."
peloton,3dycch,Ausrufepunkt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"He was a bit angry yesterday, but I'm glad today he focused on his performance and his great effort"
peloton,3dycch,oldcat,37,Mon Jul 20 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"So much Sagan love in here, he is an amazing rider but he wasn't and hasn't been cheated of any stages. Unless you get the wheels taken from under you it's all racing.   His group rode their percentages and working for Sagan was a guaranteed loss. When Cav was in his prime breakaways stuck sometimes because no one else would pull in the peloton bar HTC. When you're the best at what you do you can't expect any favours, it sucks but it's a sign of the respect they have for his skills.   Sagan needs to work on his tactics, he's young they will come with time. After a break through season where everything comes easy the next few are always going to be hard but he will get there.   He does need to decide what sort of rider he wants to be. Kittel is a sprinter who right now seems to be beyond anyone (pre injury) if gets his timing and position right he will win any sprint. If he is dropped or messes it up Griepel will be there, if they mess it up Kristoff, Cav and Degenkolb all have the beating of Sagan in some sort of finish. Sprinting is not going to win him anything, the field is flooded with enough riders to always have one beat him to the line. He has improved.his sprinting this year but I think that was a mistake. I get it in a team where he has to work for Contador, he will always be up the front into 3km. Sprinting seems like a good plan but it just isn't even if he didn't have to hop wheels alone to keep himself in there.   Sagan should have focussed on training for the hard man stages like today. That's where he can win and where his talent is immense for his age. Hard men like Thor Hushovd grew into it when sprinting stopped being an option. His late career stage wins were a thing to behold, soloing from ridiculous distances. Sagan has the talent not to need that age and experience. If he gives up sprinting now he can win more stages, own the classics season and become a World Champion. He would have to give up winning every points jersey but the Tour have tried (and failed) to do that anyway. Chances are they'll try again as they did to Cav and many others. Is a big choice for him but he needs to make it before the next insane kid comes on the scene and stops his career from having the amazing palmares he deserves rather than the ridiculous number of 2nd places.   TL;DR. Sagan is too good at everything and not good enough at any one thing. He should go full hard man."
peloton,3dycch,HERBSKIPHABS,2,Mon Jul 20 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"Did you watch any of the tour of California? He did very well on Mount Baldy, and his sprint to the finish on stage eight was brilliant. It literally came down to an inch or so, giving him the overall victory."
peloton,3dycch,oldcat,0,Tue Jul 21 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"I saw a bit, he can certainly win in races like that. Look at the calibre of the sprinters at the Tour compared to Cali. The odds of him hooking it up and beating that sort of field aren't great. There's too many others who will beat him on their day, one of them is always going to be having that day. Sagan will win stuff as it stands, maybe in a Vuelta or Giro, definitely in other tours but in the Tour de France he will continue to struggle and once Kittel is back every other sprinter is screwed (assuming a good recovery). He will also struggle in the classics as a sprint finish isn't enough if you can't cope with being a marked man."
peloton,3dycch,paranoidbridge,27,Tue Jul 21 19:34:14 2015 UTC,"Sagan needs to work on his tactics, he's young they will come with time.   This is a very popular opinion, just like in last year's TDF.  But Sagan has showed he can win in many ways, and imho one cannot claim he's tactically impaired if he managed 11 top10 finishes in this tour already.  In what way could he have done better today tactically?"
peloton,3dycch,portucalense,2,Mon Jul 20 16:40:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah he has like 17 2nd place finishes in a Tour. It's not that he can not improve (everybody can), but that is definitely not bad at all.  You also need some luck no?  I am also not seeing him becoming a climber. I am not sure a cyclist can change his specialty as much. As this ever happened, that a good sprinter became a good climber?"
peloton,3dycch,oldcat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:50 2015 UTC,"He needs some luck but you also have to make your own. Sprinters generally become hard men as it's an easier switch. That sprint ability is used to make the break away, the TT skills keep you away. I've never seen a sprinter become a climber but my encyclopedia of a girlfriend says it's happened once, Jalabert. Not sure it's possible without doping."
peloton,3dycch,portucalense,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:22:48 2015 UTC,That girl is a keeper.
peloton,3dycch,oldcat,5,Wed Jul 22 02:37:40 2015 UTC,"He covered all of the attacks that were too early to stick and pulled that last one back at the perfect point for another to go. That said I think he was in the wrong break. His team got it wrong early with so many men up the road, no team mate for him and the size of the time gap. It was much easier for them to sit on his wheel knowing no one could catch them. It made their choices simpler. Tinkoff need to give him more men or do more work to control who gets away early on if they're going to leave him to it."
peloton,3dycch,paranoidbridge,5,Mon Jul 20 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"Well, team tactics aside, I think he did well given the fact that he wasn't the best climber in the breakaway.  He still managed to have at least some of the other people work and reach the top 2nd.  If the others weren't watching him so much, he would have been in much better position."
peloton,3dycch,oldcat,5,Mon Jul 20 17:14:30 2015 UTC,But the others are always going to watch him like that. That isn't them being nasty to Sagan any more than the yellow jersey (or team) being made to work to pull back GC rivals. No one is given anything in cycling. Sagan wants them to work but he has to understand why they won't and strategise knowing that they won't.
peloton,3dycch,MetalMrHat,5,Mon Jul 20 17:33:31 2015 UTC,This is the thing I find most frustrating reading this thread. The idea that the same situation on a different day would have played out differently if the riders weren't so stupid/lazy/cowardly. If this situation happened tomorrow they'd act the same. Sagan is never going to get anything for free because he's such a big threat.
peloton,3dycch,oldcat,3,Mon Jul 20 22:37:18 2015 UTC,If anything it's a sign of respect for his talent that no help is given.

But what did catch my attention is TvG's terrible, terrible turn in that corner. I mean, just ignore Barguil and Thomas completely for a second and just look at TvG. That is a terrible angle he's going into the corner. And to be honest, I can totally see TvG's terrible angle being the result of bumping shoulders with Barguil.    What do you guys think?"

peloton,3dycch,Davidmuful,2,Mon Jul 20 15:59:28 2015 UTC,Looks like TvG is braking so he can't turn properly. Maybe he left it too late or wasn't braking hard enough before the turn?

peloton,3dycch,Ilandar,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing. He almost cuts off Quintana. Could have been a simple misjudgement, though, since everyone was fucking up that corner."
peloton,3dycch,istarbel,7,Mon Jul 20 16:26:44 2015 UTC,I agree as well. Not that TvG was the sole contributed more like two bad angles on the corner makes for very very bad corner in a bunch
peloton,3dycch,trees0n,8,Mon Jul 20 16:24:10 2015 UTC,I think that is exactly what Quintana was discussing with Froome in the warm down area judging by his hand gestures signalling TvG swiping past on his inside.
peloton,3dycch,seanv2,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:05 2015 UTC,"I mean, maybe. But it could also be he got distracted by the crazy shit ahead of him."
peloton,3dycch,0_0_7,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"Even if he got a push he still should've had ample time to slow, looks like he bombed the corner trying to make up some spots. Right after he did that Barguil bombed another line and passed two riders (one was from Sky, dunno the other) and looked like he could've forced them off the road if he screwed up at all. Barguil also clipped the wheel of that FJD rider which caused that huge pile up with the telephone pole that took out Cancellara, and Tony Martin crashed trying to avoid Barguil.  Dude is a fucking hazard."
peloton,3dycch,brakaza,9,Mon Jul 20 16:03:03 2015 UTC,Tony Martin crashed trying to avoid Barguil   that's not true. it was sprinter from Europcar. Martin actually fell on Barguil if I remember correctly.

peloton,3dycch,Variatiion,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:07:15 2015 UTC,i can hit 50km/h on a descent and im nowhere near pro level. if you are riding in the tdf you should be able to judge things like that.
peloton,3dycch,chaosandfury84,2,Mon Jul 20 16:20:35 2015 UTC,"No offense but that's not that fast for a descent.

For some reason, the second option seems like a priority to everyone.   The word ""cowardice"" comes to mind."
peloton,3dycch,mkddy,6,Mon Jul 20 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it cowardice necessarily.  Sagan controlled the attacks of the climbers and the rest of the guys were on their limit just trying to hang on until the summit.  Plus, look what happened after the top, not one rider got a wheel in front of Sagan the rest of the way.  Why help catch Plaza when all your going to do is get dropped on the decent."
peloton,3dycch,Cyklotimik,6,Mon Jul 20 15:55:56 2015 UTC,"To me it look like Sagan was really tame and was too confident in his downhill skills. I think that's why Riblon was pissed, Sagan was not willing to attack on plaza because he wanted to chase him alone in the descent even if he could have try to catch up earlier in the col."
peloton,3dycch,ms7787,8,Mon Jul 20 15:54:53 2015 UTC,"Riblon was pissed that his attack wasn't let go. Hes a whiney little athlete. He could've lead the chase if he so wanted to, why should Sagan do it?"
peloton,3dycch,Ilandar,6,Mon Jul 20 18:03:15 2015 UTC,Riblon probably wasn't pissed it was just a frustration thing because he couldn't escape and he felt Sagan wasn't even giving himself a chance. He has just as little reason to be mad at Sagan as Sagan or some of you have to be mad at the other chasers. Everyone has their own missions in the TDF.
peloton,3dycch,usuallybored,14,Mon Jul 20 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"If Sagan had a teammate in the break, he would have won the stage. The result had nothing to do with ""cowardice"" from the other riders; it was a tactical error from Sagan and Tinkoff."
peloton,3dycch,dayman_ahahaa,5,Mon Jul 20 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"Haha, true. But I think that just that people are realistic and know themselves. Why would they put work, if this means they get nothing in the end? Sagan needs to find a way to break this pattern once in a while, not sure how though."
peloton,3dycch,ms7787,3,Mon Jul 20 17:27:09 2015 UTC,If he just had one pal to ride with in most of his races to do some of the work that would completely change his problems. Like a Purito/Moreno situation. Maybe split his salary with someone.
peloton,3dycch,Flintoid,17,Mon Jul 20 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"You are saying this as a Sagan fan.   In reality for the other riders it comes down to this:  -Hope Sagan leaves late enough and has to work hard enough  to not be able to sprint the end as fast and early enough to catch the guy and front, follow him in the wheel, and go on.  -Let Sagan who is by far the best sprinter of the group ride your wheel and pass you with ease at the end.   These other riders are people too with their own ambitions. Today what happened was Sagan chased down the chasers who wanted to break away and waited too long to go himself. He almost got it but left a little late (Riblon had no business getting mad but clearly this is why he made that gesture, he thought Sagan was waiting too long himself and Sagan wasn't letting anyone get away from the group)"
peloton,3dycch,MetalMrHat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"I really thought that Sagan pulled the break for intermediate  points, the finish was an added bonus.  It explains why Tinkov did not have anyone in that break."

peloton,3dycch,ms7787,3,Mon Jul 20 15:58:09 2015 UTC,"Meh, You can just as easily phrase it as ""If they don't chase, they lose. If they do chase one of them has a chance to actually make another attack to win"".  Making Sagan do all the work is an exceptional strategy to stop him picking up more wins. The only way it's a good strategy to actually boost your own chances of winning though are if you're considering future races and hoping that one day you're the guy who makes the jump and that nobody will chase because they're also waiting for Sagan to do the work there..."
peloton,3dycch,Ludvo,0,Tue Jul 21 01:43:08 2015 UTC,If they do chase one of them has a chance to actually make another attack to win   That was definitely not a winning strategy. Sagan reeled in all the attacks within the chase group on the climb there was no way they were going to be able to attack on the descent if he wasn't made to do all the work prior.

If a rider like Quintana improves 5-10% over a couple of years, how can you tell whether that is aided by doping or not? You would expect a young rider with adequate training to improve year over year, and modern microdoping is going to allow riders to achieve the upper limits of yearly improvement without providing a smoking gun. None of this means that we shouldn't have a more transparent sport, I just think that even if everything was made available doping is still going to be possible so we shouldn't act as if there is something incriminating being hidden."

peloton,3dymoq,edlll91,36,Mon Jul 20 16:28:39 2015 UTC,The most obvious scenario to play out will be Quintana and Valverde trading massive attacks on Sky when out of nowhere Sagan and Contador emerge from the back of the GC group on a tandem and take the stage win by an hour. Oleg will still be disappointed because they both didn't get first.
peloton,3dymoq,dayman_ahahaa,28,Mon Jul 20 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the talk regarding Quintana taking it to the Froome in the Alps is merely out of a need to see Froome beaten, I don't think it will happen by anything more than a couple of seconds.  I think Tejay will end up fifth behind Valverde (3rd) and Contador (4th), though I could also see him keeping third by a whisker. Valverde has looked pretty sharp thus far and I imagine will be super useful to Quintana in breaking the Sky train and landing 1-2 hits. Contador will just be solid, but might try something nutty just in case it works, nothing to lose after all, probably on Stage 17 after the rest day.  Thomas will hang in there, but might swap with Gesink. Rest of the top 10 to stay similar.  I will eat my words come Paris of course."
peloton,3dymoq,The_77,19,Mon Jul 20 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed. People in cycling tend to forget, and I think part of it is because they want to forget because he's not as popular as other GC types, that a healthy Chris Froome is probably the best climber in the sport right now. I don't doubt that Quintana will be there soon, but Froome dominates when he's on top form and he looks quite healthy right now.  You see the same sort of sentiment in comments people make about Froome potentially being in trouble with race parcours with a lot of climbing, as if he hadn't shown time and again that he's unbeatable at this point in his career when going uphill."
peloton,3dymoq,Dux89,13,Mon Jul 20 17:53:33 2015 UTC,"I think it is rather wishful thinking on many people's part, plus the memory of Contador beating Froome at the Vuelta. But on these 7/8% climbs he's shown he's the best on form. Whether or not he's quite as good on the steeper stuff is up for debate, he might not be out and out leader, but at the Tour it's all constant gradients for 40 mins plus and in that regard he's king right now.  Also worth remembering that Quintana is still only 25, and historically the best were their best around 27/28/29, so he's still got room to improve as his competitors get older. Unless they're Valverde of course."
peloton,3dymoq,The_77,14,Mon Jul 20 18:25:24 2015 UTC,Valverde will still be winning races in 2035.

Will still hang on for a podium though.   4) Valverde   Might be stronger than Contador but will make too many efforts one day and have his legs betray him.   5) TJVG   Could finish higher if the others gamble it all and fail. 0 weapons and is just hanging on at this point   6) Nibali   Was tempted to say he'll finish top 5 after making an escape on a couple more stages but it's probably a bit too much time to make up   7) Gesink   Just gonna keep plugging away   8) Mollema   Also just gonna keep plugging away   9) Thomas   Will end up being sacrificed to guarantee Froome's safety and drop down.   10) Bardet   Going to get better and will make up time on some gambles. Wouldn't be surprised to see him be allowed to jump away in the exact same way as he did in the Dauphin√© on Wednesday.     Compared to my week 1 predictions I have Valverde up 5, Tejay up 1, Nibali down 1, Gesink in from nowhere, Mollema down 1, Thomas in from nowhere, Bardet in from nowhere.

peloton,3dymoq,oojemange,10,Mon Jul 20 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd like Quintana and friends to take chunks of time out of Froome, he just looks too strong right now.   30 seconds and a stage win maybe, but I don't think anyone will be within 2 minutes of Froome after stage 20."
peloton,3dymoq,Ham_Authority95,10,Mon Jul 20 17:56:53 2015 UTC,Something to keep in mind from 2013:  Froome's lead over Quintana after the second time trial: 6:58.  Froome's lead over Quintana after three days in the Alps: 5:03.
peloton,3dymoq,stormfallen,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:26 2015 UTC,Are you counting the 45 seconds he lost when sitting up with 3 km to go in Paris?   I guess you also have to take into account that day on Mount Semnoz Froome basically just wanted to get home. There was no need to chase on at that point.
peloton,3dymoq,madindehead,4,Mon Jul 20 21:40:15 2015 UTC,Nope.  The final time difference was 4:20.  He only lost 29 seconds on Semnoz; The rest of the difference came from the double Alpe d'Huez stage.
peloton,3dymoq,stormfallen,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:17 2015 UTC,"Stage18 (Alpe d'Huez): Quintana was 5th place before the stage, so Froome could let him go. He still gained time on his closest rivals (Contador, Kreuziger, Mollema). He did bonk (he run out of sugar) after he let Quintana go, but did not crack. He had to take food from Richie, for which he got penalised 20 seconds. This is why Quintana gained 1:06+0:20 on him. Stage 20: Quintana gained 0:29 by attacking in the last 900 meters. You could say Froome cracked, but there was no way he could loose his 5:32 lead in 900 meters.  Technically you are right, Quintana gained almost 2 minutes in the last week, but you shouldn't compare that situation to this years."
peloton,3dymoq,Pandrasl,8,Tue Jul 21 11:06:04 2015 UTC,"I think everyone has more or less the same top 10 prediction right now.   Froome Quintana Contador Valverde Van Garderen Nibali Gesink Thomas Mollema Rolland   Biggest questions here:  1) Contador or Valverde? I'm pretty confident both will end up higher than TvG, but I think the 3rd place is a toss up between them.  2) How much will Thomas fall? It's almost guaranteed that he will fall back, but how much? He worked a lot in the Pyrenees and looked a bit tired in the last couple of stages, while the others behind him seem to be improving as the Tour progresses. I can't see him holding both Gesink and Nibali, and Mollema might overtake him as well. I wouldn't be completely surprised if he has to work early one day, losing 10 or 15 minutes and dropping out of the top 10 entirely.  3) Barguil/Bardet/Rolland? Barguil still has 2 minutes on Bardet and 4 on Rolland, but I actually think Rolland is the favourite here. He was one of the best in the Pyrenees and gained almost 5 minutes on Barguil in stages 10-12, even more on Bardet. I think Gallopin will have the worst 3rd week of the 4 frenchies.  4) Who will get on breaks? Rolland is the obvious possibility, and he's only 4 minutes down on Barguil. Frank is even closer. Talansky seems too far away already, but it's possible. Pinot is very unlikely. Will someone drop and attack later? Maybe Bardet?"
peloton,3dymoq,lmm310,3,Mon Jul 20 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think it would be a very positive Tour for Movistar if they make 2nd and 3rd, specially for Valverde who never had a top3 in the tour.  Talansky is too far from top 10, but at least, I think he'll try again after the unlucky puncture of stage 14 and I wouldn't be surprised if we end with him and the 4 French fighting for Alpe d'Huez and then decide who's the one who deserves the 10th place."
peloton,3dymoq,lmm310,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"I think it would be a very positive Tour for Movistar if they make 2nd and 3rd, specially for Valverde who never had a top3 in the tour.   For sure. I'm not counting out Quintana just yet, especially after today's stage. I'm surprised by Valverde, I thought he would focus on the Vuelta but he's in great shape. He usually fades a bit on the third week though.   Talansky is too far from top 10, but at least, I think he'll try again after the unlucky puncture of stage 14 and I wouldn't be surprised if we end with him and the 4 French fighting for Alpe d'Huez and then decide who's the one who deserves the 10th place.   Talansky's only shot is via breakaway imo. It's not likely anyway, Ag2R, IAM, Europcar, Lotto, etc are all fighting for a top 10 finish so they probably wouldn't let him attack."

peloton,3dymoq,bikesandpipes,6,Mon Jul 20 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"Here‚Äôs my realistic hope: On at least one of the mountain stages, Valverde puts in an incredible amount of work for Quintana, pushing Sky to the limit, but he cracks and drops some spaces. It is enough to put Quintana neck and neck for the final mountain stage. Froome wins in a nail biter. Van Garderen continues to play it safe, and comes in a respectable third.  1. Froome 2. Quintana (less than a minute back) 3. Van Garderen (+4:00)"
peloton,3dymoq,seanv2,10,Mon Jul 20 16:48:01 2015 UTC,I hope you're right. But I don't think that Quintana has shown the ability to crack Froome on the climbs. I predict that Sky runs train on the first mountain and puts some more time into everyone. Then plays defense the rest of the stages and just covers attacks
peloton,3dymoq,freefrench,4,Mon Jul 20 16:57:36 2015 UTC,Yours is the more likely scenario. My hope is that Valverde and Quintana can work together well enough to really challenge Sky (with additional help from attacks by Contador and Nibali). But that's probably a pipe dream.

peloton,3dymoq,AmorphousForm,4,Mon Jul 20 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"Assuming Froome and Quintana hold their places there is a great contest between Contador, Valverde and Van Garderen for third overall.

The contest for the polka-dot jersey has been a bit of a non-event so far. Hopefully there will be a more serious contest for it in the Alps.

Just put it to bed.   For the first time in a while we saw Poels up protecting Froome today. I think he could be key. In the Dauphine he was quite often the last man for Froome during those climbs. Porte has had a quiet week too of course, resting up. He will also be a factor. We'll have to see how G is after today. If he is ok, he'll probably be extra committed to see Froome to victory.

About 1% of the riders has an issue each stage, so doing a little math .99 chance of making it through a stage to the 5th power for 5 stages. That get's us a 95% chance each rider will make it to the end. Take that to the 5th power again for each of the 5 riders around Tejay... there's about a 33% chance of someone competing with him for placings having an issue.

There's no real way to solve it.  1904 Tour de France, 111 years ago:   During this stage, Antoine Faur√© lead close to his hometown, and 200 fans tried to stop the rest of the cyclists from following him. Garin hurt his hand during the incident, and Giovanni Gerbi was knocked unconscious, and had to give up with broken fingers. The situation was only solved after race officials fired shots in the air.Further on, nails and broken glass had been spread along the road, which caused many flat tires."

I love soccer as well, and sometimes it blows my mind the money disparity. Take Raheem Sterling. Liverpool just sold him for ¬£49mil, or $76mil. That's literally double Sky's entire budget. For one 20-year old guy. I wish cycling had that level of financial infrastructure and support."

peloton,3dxzrk,razrsharp67,4,Mon Jul 20 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"To a degree, yes. It's hard to follow cycling in its current state. Teams blossom and fold, loyalty remains difficult, and there's intense pressure to secure sponsors just so teams can keep paying salaries. Races have a huge disparity in support. While I don't imagine I'd want cycling to reach the soccer levels of income, I really wish there'd be some consistency in team identity and funding. I think much more money in the sport would lend itself well to that."

Out of the 22 teams, only 9 remain in the same capacity now that they did then, regarding name and sponsors. That makes the sport incredibly difficult to follow, especially for new fans. I talk with my dad frequently about results, and he often asks ""now which team is that again?"" I have to phrase it in older sponsor terms to give him some idea of continuity from year to year. Etixx is still Omega Pharma to him.  You're right. I probably don't want billions in cycling. Just much more than they have now."

The Jan did not take the performance-enhancing drugs. Listen, if it was being the offseason, the Jan would be totally like, ""Hey bro-ham, are you being holding? Suh-weeet. The Jan is being having the rolling papers if you are being having the weed."" The Jan is being liking to party, and to do the disco dancing, it is well known.  But the Jan does not do the transfusions of blood, or the micro-injections of EPO, or the eating of the horse testicles for strength.   The Jan is being a simple man. The Jan takes in schnitzel and beer, and outputs death and pain. It is being that simple.  People are being trying to distract the Mighty Jan. They are gnats circling around the head of a giant. It is not even being worth the time it would take to pull off their legs and force feed them to their children. You may try to distract the mighty Jan, you may try to beat him down with your lies, with your rumors, with your inuendos, but your words are being raindrops on the back of a mountain.  People of France, gather your children. Run to the hills. For the Jan is coming. And death rides with him."

The Jan must be careful when pedaling, for when the Jan's massive thighs begin to spin so close together, they are creating a low pressure system centered on the Jan's ""special place"" that is often causing massive weather anomalies and atmospheric disturbances. It can be embarassing. There have been many cases where the Jan is being totally breaking it down on the dance floor, and then busts out with the Jan's favorite move, the Roger Rabbit, and then whole villages are blown away into ash and smoke, and for nights afterward there are being many sightings of strange lights in the sky."

Joe Papp's blog has a mirror.  http://joepapp.blogspot.com/2010/05/jan-ullrichs-2006-blog.html  Thursday, April 27, 2006   Tour of Romandie. And Bjarne Riis humps donkeys. Current mood: bored It is I.  It is the Jan.  I have done the returning. I am being like the Terminator. Oooo, wait, no, I am being like the Terminator 2, with the motorcycle and the shotgun and the having sex with a trash compactor. That is happening in Terminator 2, right? It has been a long time since the Jan has been seeing this movie.  My knee is better. It is only feeling like the fires of a thousand hells are burning in my joints, which the Jan is handling easy. The Jan snacks on pain, and dines on death. Seriously, the Jan actually dines on death, with a side of wilted spinach and a nice Grenache. The Jan may dine on death, but he is not being a savage.  The Jan has just done the finishing of the stage two of the tour of Romandie. Romandie is being the worst country the Jan has ever been to. It is smelling like cabbage, and the all the women are looking like wooly sacks of potatoes. Preferably the Jan must dine on the liver of fourteen virgins every morning to be strong, but there are not being 14 virgins in all of Romandie, the Jan is thinking. So I am not crushing as many souls as I am normally doing.  Oh, do not being getting the Jan wrong, there has been much weeping and gnashing of teeth as I flow down over the peloton like the hot pink spectre of doom and pestilence that all men know me to be. But the true crushing has not yet done the beginning in earnest. Only once will I open the portal to pain and death and rain down a storm from the darkest of hells upon the peloton. That will be in the July, of course.  The Jan has heard Mr. Riis comments. The Jan is thinking it is super classy of the team director of CSC to comment on other riders he is being having nothing to do with. Especially when he is obviously having an axe to grind. Normally, the Jan would go up to Bjarne Riis and rip his stomach out through his mouth. But the Jan is a bit tired. The team doctor says that I am worn out, that I have been porking Bjarne Riis' wife too much. I am saying, yes, this task is not being easy, for it is requiring the mountain climbing gear, and the hazmat suit, and the stomach of iron, but I am still doing it. If I am not porking Bjarne Riis' wife, then who will? Certainly not Mr. Fussy Pants Throw a Bicycle Baby Face Bjarne. He is not liking the company of women, I am hearing thourgh the grapevine. It is apparently the truth that the Bjarne Riis likes to hump donkeys. Big ones. Sometimes he is even having nasty big donkey orgies, the details of which are so horrific that even the Jan's black soul cringes in disgust. And the Jan has done nearly everything. Ask Bjarne's wife.  The Jan is keeping one burning, fear-inspiring eye on the little spanish one, Valverde. He is riding less pathetically than most other mortals lately. One eye also is being kept on Mr. Hair Monkey Marinara Boy, Ivan Basso. And it is looking kind of weird, because my eyes are being all over the place and people are being all like, Jan, what is the deal with your eyes, and I am like, ""Shut up, man, I am being watching people."" And then they are all like, ""Oh, my bad, Jan."" And the Jan is all like, ""Ja, no shit."" And then I am killing them. The Jan is hating to be interrupted when I am watching people."
peloton,3dxl1l,Itsalrightwithme,7,Mon Jul 20 15:25:11 2015 UTC,"Saturday, May 13, 2006   A good Kessler puts the lotion in the basket...  So, the yeah. The Jan is getting zeppelin-loads of the shit sandwiches from people because they are being saying that my time-trialing at the Giro is sucking.  The Jan thinks it is being time to come clean. The Jan was totally wasted during the prologue. I mean, like, the Jan was throwing up his tacos and schnitzel like two minutes before go time. And the Jan did not even eat tacos that day.  The Mikester, (as the Jan is being referring to his bro-ham and fellow Mobster Michael Rodgers,) said that the Jan was trying to have the sweet sex with Simoni's bike pump when they called his name for the start. The Jan does not remember this, but it is seeming to be possible. I have seen this bike pump when the Jan is sober, and still the Jan would totally do her. Or it, maybe. The Jan is not being clear on the gender of bike pumps.  So, ja. The Jan is blowing the TT. So what. I am not in the Giro for the gay pink shirt. Maglia Rosa. The Jan is thinking that this sounds like the name of a transvestite prostitute.  Do you doubt the Jan? Just to be reminding you of the unholy might that clings to my thighs like wet lingerie to a sweet, sweet bike pump, the Jan was being dropping a hammer on Wednesday in the team time trial. It is not being getting much coverage, but the Jan was wanting the stage win that day, so the Jan was pulling for 10 minutes at a time at like, 200 kilometers per hour. It was being totally awesome. It was the Mob's stage win. It was ours, we were being whooping CSC's ass over the last four splits. The road was crying in pain beneath my wheels, and all the spirits of the German dead were rising like a mighty host at my back, their glorious chorus of Wagner shaking the hairy hearts of the Italians in their sunken, cigarette-smoking chests.  And then there was Kessler. Or pussy-pussy-crap-face, as the Jan is now calling him. When he fell off the back, our eyes met, and he knew. The Jan does not accept weakness. Weakness brings dishonor. And dishonor must be purified by pain.  Matthias will never speak of that night, and what happened in the T-Mobile bus after everyone but the Jan and little Kessy had gone, but look into his eyes, if ever you meet him, and you will see the emptiness there. You will see the darkness, and the pain. That night, Matthias was the Jan's bike pump. And the touch of the Jan is not gentle."

You should be ashamed of you support cheating and cheaters. You are part of the  reason cheating still occurs because you still idolize these cheaters. You still worship these cheaters, instead of celebrating a great clean cyclist who won despite being shot and despite racing against cheaters.

People refuse to believe cycling is clean because the sport has no credibility to claim so.   GLM's been a broken record on this issue since he was still a professional rider, he hates it, it bothers him, he thinks it's wrong. Read the article, he got asked this by Bild. The journalist knew exactly what they were getting, you ask GLM about doping, he will tell you it's a disgrace.   I don't get what Lemond is trying to get out of doing or saying this. It's pathetic.   LeMond wants all the people who doped, won things, and sit there and take the plaudits while knowing in the back of their mind that they cheated to come clean and admit they're frauds. There are still plenty of people in the sport who fit that bill, he knows it, you know it.

Meh, I find that an immensely simplistic reading of the situation. I remember watching it, coming here, and seeing half this sub-reddit throwing around the doping accusation. Other boards I post on were doing the same. The overwhelming majority of people weren't French.   Just going blah blah blah French are butthurt is a weak excuse, I don't read the French press and neither do most of the people on this subreddit or other boards I visit. There was no real French contender on this Tour and Pinot, the closest rider to being a contender, was out of it by day 3 or something.   I think it's also kinda lame for people to be throwing that around that kind of petty nationalism given that plenty of Americans screamed LALALALLALALA about Armstrong, who for years tried to palm it off on jealous French, plenty of Brits scream LALALLALALALALALALALA about Sky (who certainly trade on ""doing it clean"") and anglophones in general have tended to circle wagons whenever an anglo rider is accused. You're Dutch, I have no doubt that if a Dutch rider was in contention and being accused there would be lots of circling wagons going on.   I have no idea whether Froome is clean or not but chalking up accusations to nationalism is weak. Accusations have credibility in cycling because cycling is dirty as shit, that's what's going on."
peloton,3dxl1l,SaviourMach,7,Mon Jul 20 12:00:28 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you on the first part, but do still maintain it is unnecessary. Nobody has anything to gain by dragging this back up, although you are right that the blame lies less with Lemond if he was prompted by Bild.   As for your second part: Yes, my reading was definitely (too) simplistic, that's undeniably so. But people with such gravitas like the French legends I was referring to really, really need to mind their words. You can't go shouting around accusations like that when you know you basically have a country's ear (and more) while you have no basis for those claims of any kind. The doping accusation and everything around it should be left to the professionals and the authorities. Not to undeniably salty old men, no matter their track record.   You have a good point regarding the 'circling of the wagons'. We've had something similar with Michael Boogerd, one of our most famed riders of recent times. Specialist in the hilly classics like the Amstel Gold Race and Liege-Bastogne-Liege and so on, but also did very well in the TdF mountains. Like every single rider of his generation he was doped up, but to this day is fiercely defended by us Dutch cycling followers.  That said, and this is 100% pure speculation based on pretty much nothing, Dutch media and general sentiment towards doping seems less harsh than in many other places. I feel there's a sense of understanding that it was so standard and institutionalised back in the day that you can hardly blame riders that much for going along with it. Short-sighted, of course, and doesn't take away from how wrong doping is, yada yada, but that's kind of the feel. As for Dutchies like Boogerd, it seems like we're not defending him as not having taken doping, but rather despite it. He's still universally loved.   I really liked your post.

I would agree in principle, though I think I need to hear exactly what Jalabert said. The problem is we get lots of inaccurate translations and a game of telephone goes on where (this is hypothetical, I'm not saying this is what LJ said) ""Froome is really dominating this race, some people will ask questions but the testing authorities can and will do their job"" turns into ""LJ said you shot up EPO, how do you respond to that Chris?"" by the time it gets to Froome.    As for Dutchies like Boogerd, it seems like we're not defending him as not having taken doping, but rather despite it. He's still universally loved.   Yeah and I don't blame them, I am not trying to be holier-than-thou on the issue. It's completely natural for people to love the guy from their country. Italians still love Pantani and Cipollini even though MP is confirmed and there's lots of smoke around MC. It's totally fine for Americans to love Lance or Floyd - I'm american and Floyd's win on the Alpe d'Huez was one of the most amazing things I've seen in cycling. Hell, everybody kind of handwaves away Eddy Merckx or Joop Zoetemelk with ""That's what they used to do back then!""  I just have a problem when it becomes negative, like of course the French hate Froome because he's British or Lance because he's American. One, I find that's not true and has never been true, and two, most people are interested in what their guys are doing.

I'm a french expat and am fully bilingual, I follow the coverage on both French and English channels (France Television & ITV4), and it struck me when they aired the bit with Jalabert getting pissed at the ITV guy today.  They were talking about ""sur une autre planete"" afterwards, and let me tell you, their interpretation of both the 1999 Armstrong L'Equipe and Jalabert's usage of the expression is wrong. Shame I'm not near my parents as I'm sure to still have that 1999 cover somewhere (I collected TdF stuff as a teen, like hoarder levels), but the expression was used as praise, not as suspicion, praise being almost the only usage for the expression.   To say of someone that he is way above the rest or that the performance was mind blowing, french sports magazine/news will use it often, for example:   Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) sur une autre plan√®te 9''58 : la fus√©e Bolt sur une autre plan√®te   I'm sure I could dig up lots more. But yeah, lots of lost in translation. Though I agree that Jalabert doesn't help at times, but he's never directly accusing, but notes that from a pundit's (with first hand experience) perspective Chris Froome & Sky raise highbrows.   And I mean, Jalabert would know a thing or two about doping, fucker, I want my memories back."
peloton,3dxl1l,ox_,2,Mon Jul 20 13:53:12 2015 UTC,"More like 90s and 2000s cheats made the bed and the current era of riders are forced to lie in it.  I know that reporters are responsible for fishing for these quotes and then leading with them but ex-riders are giving them the ammunition.  I try not to have my head in the sand but it's exhausting when the only thing you hear about the Tour is borderline unprovable (at least in the short term) accusations. Must drive the riders insane.  For what it's worth, I think Dave Brailsford has far too much to lose by risking doping Team Sky. He masterminded 20+ gold medal wins for Great Britain, knighthoods, not to mention 2 and maybe 3 Tour wins. Most of the dirty generation weren't caught by tests at the time, it was cars full of rEPO, retrospective tests using new technology and testimony from teammates. Dave knows that it's impossible to cover up 100%."

peloton,3dxl1l,savardfaire,7,Tue Jul 21 07:12:27 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who watched Slaying the Badger and ended up siding with Hinault? Not saying Hinault isn't a dick or whatever, because he might be, but LeMond just came off so butthurt and it really left a bad taste in my mouth. Plus, the guy lived in France for how many years and still pronounces the ""h"" in Hinault??"
peloton,3dxl1l,danefalberg,3,Mon Jul 20 13:21:11 2015 UTC,"The problem with Slaying the Badger is that it's a two hour documentary aimed primarily at Americans who don't follow race cycling. So they had to pump up the drama. Maybe Hinault tried to double cross LeMond or not, nobody really knows except for the Badger himself (doesn't it feel equally plausible that his idea of supporting LeMond was to push him as hard as possible so he could take the title as a great champion rather than as the obvious beneficiary of a handshake deal?) and even the LeMonds gave the impression they don't really care anymore - Greg won the Tour, it was cool, they still say hi when they see Hinault and talk about life. The real villain was probably Paul Koechli or Bernard Tapie but the doc only briefly brushes on that.  As for pronouncing the H, dropping it when saying a French name is kind of a hard trick for English speakers to learn. I've been studying French off and on since I was a teenager and I still mess that one up. Plus, if I'm speaking in English, I'm going to slightly adjust my pronunciation of French names or words to fit the context and be more understandable. Taking LeMond's broad Northern California accent and saying ""Yeah, so I wanned t'think tha' BEAAAAAR-NAAARRRR EEE-NOOO was gonna be faaair t'me"" would sound kind of insufferable, actually."
peloton,3dxl1l,hipsterhank,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a good point. The story almost certainly got the Hollywood treatment a little bit.  Again about the H though, it's not like he's reading the name on a piece of paper every he says it. How many times do you think he's heard people correctly pronounce it in the decades since he first met Hinault? (This is a silly thing to dwell on, but) he has to know you don't say the H. And it's not like the English and French pronunciations of Bernard either, because at least Bernard is a common name in America. I've heard of plenty of people named Bernard, but I only know one Hinault. I dunno, it's silly, but it irks me for some reason."
peloton,3dxl1l,danefalberg,2,Mon Jul 20 14:09:25 2015 UTC,"I just watched that yesterday, actually. I'll admit that I didn't really know much of that story beforehand, except that I knew Hinault and LeMond had some contention between them. I do understand why LeMond was upset: he felt like he'd been lied to about his role and future on the team after spending several years as the heir-apparent. Could he have been a bit more thick skinned? Maybe. But that doesn't mean he was wrong to feel slighted."

peloton,3dwok0,OnlyFactsNoContext,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"So, I noticed you didn't answer either question, and then used the strawman fallacy incorrectly.  Why?  I guess that's 3 questions I'm interested in hearing the answers to."
peloton,3dwok0,lmm310,2,Tue Jul 21 05:51:35 2015 UTC,"A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument which was not advanced by that opponent.   As to why it is a strawman fallacy: What did my comment say again? That he wouldn't get DQ'd, not because he's French, but because he's a professional road cyclist. Because there is literally zero precedent for a rider being DQ'd for causing a crash by overcooking a corner. In fact, the only instances in which a rider may be DQ'd for causing a crash is when said rider breaks some rule while doing so, e.g. when a rider strays off his line during a sprint, or in obvious cases, e.g. when a rider purposely* causes a crash.  You assumed that I was implying that the ASO doesn't show bias for French riders when enforcing the rules. I didn't say that. I didn't imply it. You're arguing against something I didn't say. That's a strawman.  Now that you've learned how a strawman fallacy works, I'll answer the other two questions.   So you don't think being French has any effect on the decisions of the Director of the ASO?   It very well might. Depends on the case. In this case it wouldn't matter, he wouldn't be DQ'd regardless of nationality. In other cases, when the riders are actually guilty of breaking a rule, the ASO might be softer on French riders.   We've seen Italian teams favoured in the Giro and Spanish teams in Vuelta, so why not French teams in the TdF?   No reason. It happens everywhere. And it's not only French teams in the Tour de France, it can happen with other riders, especially guys who have a large fan support, like Cancellara, Sagan or Contador."

peloton,3dx9od,RyanMTB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:32:05 2015 UTC,What is the point in sprint and mountains jerseys? Is it just bragging rights or do teams not care? Because Sky don't even have a sprinter.
peloton,3dx9od,jtw7,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:37 2015 UTC,They are only ~20 person playing the general classification (with less than 10 having any actual chances of winning). General classification differences are (mostly) done in mountain top finish. You cannot ask the rider to finish in an all-out race to the top every single day for 3 weeks.  This leaves a lot of stages that would not count apart from the stage victory. And most of the rider only there for bringing back bottles. This is boring for both the viewers and the riders.  At one point to overcome this the tour had multiples stages per day (this had also the advantage of having multiple cities pay for having one finish line in their town).  The point and mountain jersey give an objective for the teams that can't (any longer) fight for the yellow jersey. It give an interest for stage that could otherwise see all the riders casually ride to the finish line knowing a break by their leader can't happen.  I do recon however that theses jersey grow old quick. Sagan got across the mid-race sprint casually looking back if anyone was foolish enough to dispute it to him today. The mountain jersey is a lot about being in the break in mountain stage as often as possible more than beating the best ones.

However it seems his image is not quite the same abroad. How is he viewed abroad?  Also I heard he had been copiously booed in Utrecht, anyone know why that is?"
peloton,3dx9od,viola3458,3,Mon Jul 20 13:18:33 2015 UTC,"I love Voeckler. For me, the Tour has not officially started until he launches one of his wildly entertaining yet ultimately doomed attacks."
peloton,3dx9od,bjanos,6,Mon Jul 20 22:03:44 2015 UTC,"I kind of like to think of Vockler like the lovable  old uncle who you know might do something outrageous at the family reunion, but everyone's just waiting for him to have a couple glasses of wine to figure out exactly what that might be...   Tommy's been a fixture of my cycling-watching-hood for so long that it's almost become an in-joke where you look up and go ""oh gosh, vockler's in the break...there must be something about to happen!"""
peloton,3dx9od,blandwhiteguy,3,Mon Jul 20 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"Like I said in the Stage 16 thread: I always look forward to the master of making silly faces in the break. In France he is much loved and I think at least speaking for myself it is great to see him in breaks. However not a lot of foreign people see him as a great rider just because he rode in the yellow jersey for a number of days. Though I do expect a similar thing would happen if a Dutch rider would hold onto the yellow for multiple days, which has not happened in a long time either."
peloton,3dx9od,Thogon,7,Mon Jul 20 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"He's seen as a little ridiculous outside of France I think, although we all still love him and cheer for him!"
peloton,3dx9od,BeardyGuts,6,Mon Jul 20 13:31:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about booing or his reputation in general, but I find him very entertaining and fun to watch. Really cheered for him when he was in yellow in 2011."
peloton,3dx9od,achillebro,3,Mon Jul 20 13:24:56 2015 UTC,"Question on the tactics of TDF.  When I have been watching there have been frequent mentions by commentators of the advantage of a team like Movistar for example having a guy in the breakaway to help Quintana later on.   Why is this an advantage to have a guy in the breakaway when he inst going for stage win?  Its never helped so far and if it was such an advantage i would've thought that Sky would do it too,"
peloton,3dx9od,pyrignis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:02:16 2015 UTC,"Think of last year's pave stage,  we straight was in the breakaway and when Nibali attacked,  he helped him to gain time"
peloton,3dx9od,cppn02,6,Tue Jul 21 23:53:22 2015 UTC,"The guy can act as a ""relay"". The best case senario is a stage like the Alpes-d'Huez one where there is two big climb separated by a rather long flat section. The GC rider gets to attack in the first climb and then meet up with his teammate who is going to shield him from the wind on the flat section."
peloton,3dx9od,BeardyGuts,8,Mon Jul 20 13:07:16 2015 UTC,"Also, this frees you up from any work in the peloton so your team will have more energy for the final."
peloton,3dx9od,blandwhiteguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:24:09 2015 UTC,Thanks. So why don't the other GC teams adopt this strategy?
peloton,3dx9od,Twybaydos,8,Mon Jul 20 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"It doesn't always work. For example, the rider in the break can use up too much energy to get there, and be useless when they are reached. It's also possible that the rider is never reached by the peloton.    In terms of not even attempting the tactic, a team concentrating on maintaining a lead over others won't attack, and therefore won't use a rider in the break. BMC and Sky for example, are defending a podium place and yellow respectively and their leaders will almost certainly not attack from long enough to make a relay useful."
peloton,3dx9od,blandwhiteguy,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:04 2015 UTC,IIRC - 2012 I remember Sagan being in the break to help Nibali when both at Cannondale.  He lasted about 3 minutes
peloton,3dx9od,pyrignis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:35 2015 UTC,2013 Vuelta an Astana rider waited for Nibali on Angliru and dropled immediately.
peloton,3dx9od,savardfaire,4,Tue Jul 21 05:52:13 2015 UTC,"That will depend on the case. Multiple reason could explain it:   Sometime your relay rider can't catch the ""right"" breakaway. Even if he catches it, you need a rider that is able to stay in front in a pass that is hard enough for your GC rider to drop his opponents. You rider in the breakaway is a teammate your GC rider doesn't have when he has to grind then break his opponents.   Finally Your GC riders has to actually be able to drop his opponent. If he fails you have two riders (your GC rider and the relay) that are more tired than they should be. On top of that you can add the rest of your team that had to take more relay because of a missing rider and pushed hard to give your GC rider a shot. Making it work as a main strategy is a very big investment you can't do everyday (maybe unless you are Pierre Rolland and Vockler is in front once again)."
peloton,3dx9od,Jevo_,3,Mon Jul 20 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"Why don't the Dutch do better at cycling?  Only two GC winners. Nobody's won the maillot jaune for 26 years. One stage win since 2005. Not much better in any of the other Grand Tours or the classics. It's hard to think of a country that enjoys riding a bike more, so they should do better."
peloton,3dx9od,savardfaire,7,Mon Jul 20 12:42:50 2015 UTC,"Many people ride their bikes in the Netherlands. But riding a bike for utilitarian reasons are far removed from bike racing. So only a small fraction of Dutch bike riders care about bike racing. They do pretty well for their size in general, so I don't think it is fair to say they aren't doing well."
peloton,3dx9od,danefalberg,3,Mon Jul 20 12:52:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know, to me it seems like quite a lot of Dutch people care. I was in the areas where the tour was going to start a few weeks ago and there was a ton of excitement. The crowds were enormous during that start and the Tour starts in the Netherlands more than any other country besides France, of course. The Giro started there too last year. There's a tradition of post-Tour criteriums which draws great crowds all over the country. HEMA was running a line of cycling-inspired dresses for the tour, and the cafe by the flat I was renting had copies of a really cool high-end cycling mag.  So that's why I'm surprised, I get the impression a lot of people do care, and there certainly was a tradition of Dutch riders doing better than they do now. Belgium is possibly an unfair comparison, but it's a natural one as they're right there, and there's plenty of Belgians doing stuff in the tour."
peloton,3dx9od,Jevo_,4,Mon Jul 20 14:02:53 2015 UTC,"Look at the results for any World Cup cyclocross race and you'll understand. Same goes for Belgians. The Dutch generally produce riders more suited one day classics as well, though I'm not sure why. Something I've always assumed, but I guess I've never known for sure is that cyclocross is more popular in the Netherlands than the tour. That could be false though."
peloton,3dx9od,danefalberg,2,Mon Jul 20 14:19:06 2015 UTC,"Lots of Dutch like to watch cycling, and when an event like the Tour comes by, everybody cares, even if they don't watch cycling outside of that. But just like riding a bike to work in the Netherlands doesn't mean you want to race bikes, there is little correlation between watching cycling races and wanting to do them yourself. The reason many GTs start there, is because many people like cycling and will turn up, and the Netherlands has a lot of money, and no big Tour of their own to spend it on. It is unfair to compare Belgium and The Netherlands in terms of cyclists, Belgium has simply always been better, and the sport gets more attention there."
peloton,3dx9od,edlll91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"Belgium also has more French influence, which probably adds to the popularity of cycling there as compared to The Netherlands."
peloton,3dx9od,Jevo_,3,Mon Jul 20 17:41:20 2015 UTC,I've got a bunch of questions:   Is the medical/penalties report available online? Are there any recent stories similar to Sepulveda's lift but of successful cheating? ( a question raised in discussion with /u/onlygraycellleft)  Are there any other races on cycling calendar besides Qinghai Lake with 11 to 20 days of racing? Is this the first time we're going to have a rest day on Tuesday?
peloton,3dx9od,Sappert,3,Mon Jul 20 11:41:08 2015 UTC,"Volta a Portugal is 11 stages this year, if you include the prologue. I believe it is the longest stage race after the GTs and Qinghai Lake.  It isn't the first time a rest day is on a tuesday, but I am struggling to come up with examples from the Tour right now."
peloton,3dx9od,edlll91,3,Mon Jul 20 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"Last year, first rest day was on a tuesday."

peloton,3dx9od,somethingwithcoffee,3,Mon Jul 20 12:07:31 2015 UTC,"Not that peculiar, as the Monday was Bastille Day, the French national day and so they needed a stage on that day.    Why there is a stage today is beyond me though."

peloton,3dx9od,L_Dawg,5,Tue Jul 21 05:51:47 2015 UTC,"How much do the different bikes in the peloton make a difference to the outcome of races?  I had a pretty big argument with someone the other day about how much it matters which bikes a team is riding on. He was convinced that road cycling is akin to Formula 1, where the machines used have a big influence on the outcome of a race. The only time I've ever seen the bikes mentioned in terms of their influence on a race outcome is to do with mechanical failure (e.g. chaingate, Vanmarcke flatting in every spring race) and not actual performance of a bike.  The closest thing I can find to argue that the bikes matter in determining race winners is Cavendish's supposed reluctance to move to Sky a few years ago due to bike preference.  Anyone have any input on this?"
peloton,3dx9od,mmitchell30,4,Mon Jul 20 10:31:08 2015 UTC,"In terms of GC I would say basically never (LeMond's famous win being a possible exception) because the time gaps are way bigger than could reasonably be explained by having a different bike in most cases.  Sprints decided by a matter of cm, I could see the argument that the bike could make a difference, if the manufacturers claims are true. As an example take Sagan when he was at Cannondale sprinting on the SuperSix when most of his rivals had dedicated aero bikes (though his recent results show its probably not the bike making the difference)."
peloton,3dx9od,hi-i-am-new-here,6,Mon Jul 20 11:44:33 2015 UTC,"This used to be a big issue - not so much with frames, but riders would choose to ride Lightweight wheels (back when they were the best thing ever) then they would be rebranded with Zipp or Shimano or whatever.  BMC are on Schwalbe tyres, but are using Continentals in the rain.  That's just a couple of examples from my head."
peloton,3dx9od,Jevo_,5,Mon Jul 20 11:42:28 2015 UTC,"Riders have preferences but it's generally TT bikes where there are bigger differences, most of the top end level of bikes in the peloton will have much of a muchness difference wise but the TT bikes can carry all sorts of different shapes in the quest for aero gains. The bike Bradley Wiggins had for his Tour de France TT was supposed to give him the most aero gains out of all of them at the time for instance."
peloton,3dx9od,hi-i-am-new-here,5,Mon Jul 20 10:39:29 2015 UTC,"To what extent is a GC rider born to be a GC rider opposed to training to be one? The same goes for A classics rider (which I assume is easier to train for as it's easier to bulk up than shed a lot of weight).   There has been talk of Kwiato potentially turning into a GC rider later in his career. So he should be able to train to be one? Could Sagan be a GC contender if he put his mind to it?   A lot of other questions can come from this e.g. different types of riders, how old they need to be or what stage in their career for the different type of riding. I thought GC might be a good start though."
peloton,3dx9od,Jevo_,7,Mon Jul 20 10:05:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is down to genetics. A good GC rider need to able to ride at his limit for long periods of time, in a TT or up a long mountain. This is quite different from a sprinter, who needs a high peak power output, but doesn't really need a big sustained power output. That's muscles, and they can be trained to a certain extent, but you won't become a world class bike rider if you don't train them to your strengths.   Next there is build, a good GC rider needs to have a slender build. Wide shoulders might look good on the beach, but they won't help you get up a mountain any faster. Look at guy like Romain Bardet, he is quite tall for a climber at 1.84m, but he has very narrow shoulders, which means his upper body mass is small. Sprinters and puncheurs like Gilbert have more upperbody mass than climbers, because it isn't detrimental to them in the same way, and a bit of muscle up there can even be beneficial to them.  Before his cancer Lance Armstrong was a great classics rider, winning San Sebastian, Fleche Wallone and the World Championship. But he wasn't a world class climber, because he still retained some upper body mass from his triathlon days. His cancer and the subsequent loss of muscle mass, is likely what made him able to win the Tour. A rider like Peter Sagan also carries a lot of bulk, which would restrict him from being able to convert in my opinion, if you have a bit of bulk, it can be hard to lose it again, without also losing muscles in your legs. Kwaitkowski doesn't have quite as much bulk, but he seems to be a bit too heavy these days to climb with the best. He showed great potential as a GC rider in 2013, but I suspect he has bulked up a bit since, and it has probably helped him in the classics. He could make the conversion, but I believe it would hurt his ability to compete in the classics. It is rare that you see riders make a drastic conversion, such as Sagan from sprinter/cobbled classics rider to GC rider. It was speculated that Cancellara would make the change, but it never happened.  I don't know if this answered your question, but I hope it helped shed a bit of light on different rider types and their body types."
peloton,3dx9od,hi-i-am-new-here,2,Mon Jul 20 10:34:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I actually have never heard of Armstrong being a great classics rider, just about his TdF victories. Big Mig was tall, and I assume a very good climber for him to reach the success he did. What helped him win? His huge aerobic capacity?   This was the perfect answer, thanks!"
peloton,3dx9od,AndyDufresne2,5,Mon Jul 20 14:01:11 2015 UTC,"Incredible amounts of EPO. Riders like Indurain and Riis were helped by the fact that they could use as much EPO as their body could tolerate, without any chances of being caught. That allowed bigger riders to climb better. So I left these riders out on purpose, because of the all the EPO, they don't compare well to modern riders."
peloton,3dx9od,hi-i-am-new-here,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:08:26 2015 UTC,"I know that, but nearly all of the riders there were on huge amounts of EPO, so he still needed something special to beat the others didn't he? Or did large amounts of EPO benefit larger riders more when climbing?  I know we can't compare to modern riders, but for those tours he was a large rider racing against others on EPO?"
peloton,3dx9od,TonyAllenJr,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:55 2015 UTC,Drugs don't affect everyone equally.  I'd expect body mass to affect blood volume and blood volume to affect blood doping.  Aside from that genetics will affect baseline hematocrit and reactions to drugs.

I also wonder why they settled on those numbers because it means the time gap between 3rd and 4th is bigger than that between 2nd and 3rd, which seems inconsistent to me. Something like 10-5-2 (for example) might be better in that regard?"
peloton,3dx9od,Schele_Sjakie,4,Mon Jul 20 09:58:11 2015 UTC,it means the time gap between 3rd and 4th is bigger than that between 2nd and 3rd   One way to see it is that the 4th is not on the podium. It kind of goes well with the tradition of making the 4th place just as frustrating as 2nd place.
peloton,3dx9od,Ludvo,6,Mon Jul 20 13:10:48 2015 UTC,"Each race chooses for themselves. A trend is that they get smaller. A decade ago the time bonuses in the Tour were 20-12-8, if I remember correctly. Shorter stage races will usually have smaller time bonuses as well, to keep the race close. Back in the day, I'm quite certain that the time bonuses in the Tour were measured in minutes rather than seconds. This reflects the fact that the time between the GC contenders are generally getting smaller over time, requiring the time bonuses to do the same, so they don't give too big an advantage. Why it ended up with the ratio 10-6-4 I don't know. One reason could be, that it was desired that 2nd and 3rd combined should equal 1st. Given the options available 6-4 seems like the best solution, if you want a 1st to be significantly better than 2nd, without making 2nd and 3rd equal."
peloton,3dx9od,Ludvo,4,Mon Jul 20 10:19:21 2015 UTC,"Where do the 'standard' time bonuses of 10-6-4 come from, is it a UCI thing or does each race get to chose?   It's allowed by the UCI and each race decides on their own if they want to include them. The TdF usually mixes it up after some years. Some years do have time bonuses, but some years they don't.   I also wonder why they settled on those numbers because it means the time gap between 3rd and 4th is bigger than that between 2nd and 3rd, which seems inconsistent to me. Something like 10-5-2 (for example) might be better in that regard?   Good question, I've got no answer for that."
peloton,3dx9od,SuperCrossPrawn,4,Mon Jul 20 10:16:22 2015 UTC,"Me and my brother, both cycling laymen, got into an argument yesterday.   I was saying that the peloton has an advantage on descents because the air resistance gets stronger with higher speeds. He was saying that it doesn't really matter since you don't really spend too much energy during descents (so the ""waste"" caused by drag is smaller).   Who was right? I understand that it probably depends on the type of descent (for example, I guess that the more technical descents are actually better for a breakaway), but in general?"
peloton,3dx9od,L_Dawg,2,Mon Jul 20 09:47:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the answers!
peloton,3dx9od,ACrocHunta,5,Mon Jul 20 10:08:13 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine the breakaway having an advantage. They can reach higher speeds due to having more space. Being in the peloton will mean that there's less air resistance, but that doesn't help the guy in the front of the peloton catch up to the breakaway. So the breakaway has a speed advantage, but the peloton has a reduced air resistance advantage which will help them recover. That's how I see it at least"
peloton,3dx9od,chewmacheck,3,Mon Jul 20 09:55:53 2015 UTC,"In general I would say the break, on most descents the riders will hit a 'top speed' where it doesn't really matter if you are out on your own or in the middle of the pack, you're not really going to go any faster. Meaning that both the break and peloton will be going the same speed, essentially making any time gains either way difficult, which is generally in the breaks favour.  Of course as you say a steeper or more technical descent will be better for escapees, a shallow descent on big wide roads with easy corners will favour the peloton."
peloton,3dx9od,TheGinjaNinja6828,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:55:50 2015 UTC,"You can go faster. See this descent (0:36) where one rider is in the slipstream but helps push the other faster.  Probably wouldn't matter as much compared to a flat road but if its not that steep of a descent and riders are still pedaling, drafting could help a fair amount."
peloton,3dx9od,Jevo_,3,Mon Jul 20 09:55:12 2015 UTC,"On fairly straight descents there is a good advantage.  You often see the front riders pedaling furiously, while the riders on second or third wheel are just coasting.  On more technical descents it doesn't matter as the riders need to pick their own lines through the corners and may have different points on the corners when they brake or accelerate."

peloton,3dx9od,0_0_7,2,Mon Jul 20 09:39:57 2015 UTC,They've definitely been switching back and forth for the last couple of days. Would be interested to know the answer too.

I'm pretty sure Hesjedal (or which ever rider was in the break yesterday) was wearing green, as I distinctly remember Carlton Kirby saying that the green poc helmets look like ""carved out watermelons."" Maybe I'm wrong though."
peloton,3dvjbk,cswigert,64,Sun Jul 19 21:50:09 2015 UTC,The 'best' sprinter is already rewarded with stage wins; a sprinter's jersey that would exist just to reward the guy who wins the most flat stages seems redundant.
peloton,3dvjbk,P1mpathinor,20,Sun Jul 19 23:02:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. The sprinters (all, what, 5-6 of them) already contend for most of the stage wins and don't really need an extra competition on top of that. However, a jersey for basically 'being involved all over' is pretty cool."
peloton,3dvjbk,roveboat,75,Mon Jul 20 00:00:17 2015 UTC,Sagan is the best non-GC rider. Ends top 5 in almost every stage. That seems like the most obvious deserved winner for the green jersey.
peloton,3dvjbk,Hubertoi,9,Sun Jul 19 22:38:27 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong - I am a huge fan of Sagan's.  I am also in awe of Greipel's speed and I find it fascinating they are chasing the same jersey in completely different and successful paths.  Can you imagine two riders chasing yellow in two different paths.
peloton,3dvjbk,Hubertoi,42,Sun Jul 19 22:50:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know if its that different. The stages Greipel won, Sagan was 2nd, 2nd, 4th, and 3rd in the stage Cavandish won. Hes still a world class sprinter too. The yellow jersey is also a clash between climbers and time trialists (except they forgot to add TT's this year)."
peloton,3dvjbk,party1234,10,Sun Jul 19 22:55:46 2015 UTC,"Agree he is an impressive sprinter in his own right but if Sagan approached it strategically like Greipel and relied on these 2nd, 2nd, 4th and 3rd placings we wouldn't even be talking about him as a green contender.  In a pure sprint, Sagan is no match right now.  So he is using his semi climbing skills to augment intermediate sprint points in ways that Greipel or other sprinters can't even match.  That seems different to me.   Sagan is a unique rider."
peloton,3dvjbk,finest_bear,17,Mon Jul 20 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"Different, but in no way less deserving.   Greipel has no complaint that he can't climb. If he wants those points, use energy to get up the hill. If he can't, his loss, not Sagan's"
peloton,3dvjbk,JKM-,5,Mon Jul 20 03:37:31 2015 UTC,I am the last person to say he is undeserving.  I am a HUGE fan of Sagan's.  I think he is one of the best riders in the whole tour.
peloton,3dvjbk,bistian00,8,Mon Jul 20 03:39:59 2015 UTC,"Greipel also has a better lead out team, and Sagan is usually left to his own to do well."
peloton,3dvjbk,ClintRenee,2,Mon Jul 20 04:24:12 2015 UTC,"Agree - I have said that over and over in this sub.  But that is part of the equation that Sagan has to calculate.   Also,  Sagan spends so much energy out on the road fending for himself while Greipel sits in a protective cocoon much of the race  conserving energy is another big factor."
peloton,3dvjbk,bistian00,8,Mon Jul 20 04:28:05 2015 UTC,"Yes (not this year, though).  Rider 1: Quintana, attacking in mountains, while having mediocre TT talent.  Rider 2: Indurain, who would win TT's and mostly defend in the mountains (Bradley Wiggins would also fit that category).  Most GC contenders have fairly good TT skills."
peloton,3dvjbk,FrancisField,19,Sun Jul 19 23:02:49 2015 UTC,"In Latin America (don't know if in Spain also) we call it ""the regularity jersey"", meaning that is won by the rider with the most regular results in stages. That being the case Sagan is probablly the most regular rider I've seen in the 10ish years I watch the Tour"
peloton,3dvjbk,edlll91,5,Mon Jul 20 04:06:17 2015 UTC,"It's very impressive, he's been in the top 5 placings for 8 of the stage finishes he's contested so far in this Tour. The points jersey is basically made for him, no matter how ASO try to rejig the rules and make it more competitive."
peloton,3dvjbk,Dux89,2,Mon Jul 20 13:08:38 2015 UTC,Interesting name for it in Latin America because it says more directly what it means to reward.   Have you seen the rule changes that are meant to favor flat stage winners at the TdF over more consistent regularity:  http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/the-changing-face-of-the-tour-de-frances-green-jersey/
peloton,3dvjbk,KayceS,3,Mon Jul 20 04:20:18 2015 UTC,"It's an unofficial name, but commentators use it all the time. I saw those changes and taught It would make the competition a little more interesting (I was right). Last year was so boring because they handed it to Sagan from the beginning"
peloton,3dvjbk,UnitedRoad18,4,Mon Jul 20 04:42:02 2015 UTC,Regularity jersey would be the direct translation of the green jersey equivalent in la vuelta
peloton,3dvjbk,KayceS,15,Mon Jul 20 07:38:10 2015 UTC,"Sagan is the best slightly uphill sprinter and one of the best flat sprinters. The debate happens because we may end with Greipel winning 4 stages if he wins in Paris and no green jersey, but we can't have a green jersey while only having points for the winner, since that's the only way I'm seeing Sagan without the jersey."
peloton,3dvjbk,unburntmotherofdrags,13,Sun Jul 19 22:30:35 2015 UTC,"Would dispute the ""very different ways"" part. Sagan has been the third best sprinter in the Tour. Despite the fact that people like to constantly say he's ""not a sprinter"" (whatever that means), he's been just behind Cav and Greipel in pure sprints. He's been scoring points the exact same way as Greipel... But he's also been scoring points in additional ways too, where Greipel has reserved his points-scoring solely for sprints."
peloton,3dvjbk,Ryannnnnn,44,Mon Jul 20 01:57:54 2015 UTC,"Its called the points jersey.  The winner of the most points recieves the jersey.  Sean kelly is the prototype of a green jersey winner, and not is because he is Irish.  He could battle with any one. He was not a pure sprinter.  He was a Belgian style tough as nail rider. Chipo could out sprint anyone, but wouldn't even start a climb. He got a fair number of stage wins.   Overall riders win yellow, climbers win polka dots, sprinters get stage wins. The green jersey is a prize for a special style of rider."
peloton,3dvjbk,sh545,9,Sun Jul 19 22:00:29 2015 UTC,"Look at the winners during the early 2000's. Cooke, McEwen, Zabel, Ale-Jet, etc. all were sprinters first and foremost.   The tour used to have many more pure sprinting stages with a boulevard to finish on. In the last few there seems to be a lot more punchy type stages to try and get variety in winners. Cipo won 4 In a row. Look at this year - no rider has a shot of doing that.   Sagan is special. But you have to realize the tour set up also likely determines who can realistically win the green jersey. I don't see them going back to the days of Armstrong ( pretty boring), so Sagan could have success for plenty years ahead."
peloton,3dvjbk,Ryannnnnn,2,Mon Jul 20 02:09:07 2015 UTC,You make it sound like sprinters don't chase green.  Greipel would obviously love to have all of these victories add up to a green jersey.
peloton,3dvjbk,sh545,9,Sun Jul 19 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"He would. And I wish my local track results would lead to an invite to the Berlin Six. But that's not how it works.  The green jersey is not a big enough prize for the pure sprinters,  midrange point hunting kills the chance for stage wind."
peloton,3dvjbk,dampew,3,Sun Jul 19 23:12:24 2015 UTC,All of the major contenders for green are all the elite level sprinters as it is every year.
peloton,3dvjbk,dampew,9,Mon Jul 20 00:58:40 2015 UTC,"I think that would simply cheapen both the green jersey, and this new jersey you suggest. Im pretty sure if you add the standings overall, as in number on each stage sagan will still be very very high up. Higher than any other sprinter. Sagan is just better than any other sprinter right now, he should be rewarded for being able to, and actually hanging with the big climbers on the larger mountains. Not like Sagan is incapable of winning a stage/sprint either."
peloton,3dvjbk,davidonformosa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:08:37 2015 UTC,I wasn't suggesting a change really - just starting an interesting discussion based on the tour organizers actions to what seems meant to focus the green on winning sprint stages.
peloton,3dvjbk,dgran73,5,Sun Jul 19 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"Others whom are winning Sprint stages aren't supplementing that with other points.          If in football, team A wins 1 lose 3 games, and another team B draws 4 games. Team B has more points and deemed the best team despite not winning any games."
peloton,3dvjbk,oojemange,2,Sun Jul 19 22:47:37 2015 UTC,Greipel is contesting every intermediate sprint he gets to and I don't think he has lost a single one where they were both there.  The difference is Sagan has got in breakaways and contested finishes where Greipel couldn't.
peloton,3dvjbk,dgran73,5,Mon Jul 20 08:20:41 2015 UTC,"Problem is it's not Sagan vs. Greipel. It's all riders vs each other. The points system doesn't discriminate. Is there enough differentiation between sprinters and the rest of the pack to discriminate? do team nominate sprinters ad they simply pick up points in the order they pass through? But that could lead to more uncontested sprints... it's a hard one.            So is Sagan the best sprinter and deserving of the green? Well it's like 100m sprint, whereby the athletes must run the 1 mile from the hotel to the track, and they can start as soon as they get there. If someone gets to the track before Usain Bolt, are they a better sprinter than him? no. Are they better long distance runner? yes, but did they win the sprint? yes. Maybe Bolt needs to work on his long distance. Apply that to Greipel.            Note: I haven't slept, and I've drank a litre of coffee. So I'm apolorry if this doesn't make sense."
peloton,3dvjbk,Jh95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:41:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think the running analogy works, but lets try again with the football one.   But it's not as simple as three points for a win, one for a draw, lets say to start with you get three points for a win whether that's a home game on a perfect pitch or for a wet Tuesday in Stoke.  And lets say there are some teams with lots of flair players who are not very good when they play in Stoke (they don't like getting kicked, they don't like the cold etc etc), but when the conditions are good, they trounce everyone by 4 or 5 goals.   Then you have another team who are very defensive and play well on the counter. They are very good at grinding out 1-0 wins, they don't care where they play. Occaisionally they make a mistake and draw, or come up against a flair team and lose but usually they are very consistent.  Now lets say one season most of the games are played on wet Tuesdays in Stoke. The consistent team wins by miles. It's boring, and nobody wants to watch. So the league change the rules and stop scheduling so many games in Stoke. They also give a bonus point if you score more than 3 goals, to encourage attacking play. The consistent team will still do very well, but the flair team will have more chance of winning the league. It's not about saying one type of team should win the league, it's about creating a balance between the two types of teams so there is competition between  them - the goal is to create an interesting competition, not find out who is the most consistent team, or who is the most flair team.  I also think this is the balance the Tdf are trying to find. They are happy for Sagan to win but they would like it to be close between him and the people who win multiple stages. I think they have the right idea."
peloton,3dvjbk,HelperBot_,7,Mon Jul 20 10:17:19 2015 UTC,Thor Hushovd was a great example of an exciting green jersey guy.  Remember those stages where he attacked in the mountains to win stages and points?  Even when he was already in the green jersey he'd do crazy stuff to make sure Cavendish or whoever couldn't take it from him.
peloton,3dvjbk,Jaeger-bomb-bastic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:22:05 2015 UTC,Agree - I loved his spirit.  Would Thor win under today's rule change?  That is the heart of my original thread.   Seems like the tour is trying to change the character of the green jersey.
peloton,3dvjbk,daveirl,6,Mon Jul 20 02:25:00 2015 UTC,"No idea, but I like the contrast between a guy like Sagan and a guy like Cav or Greipel."
peloton,3dvjbk,sh545,5,Mon Jul 20 02:28:04 2015 UTC,Sagan may not be quite as quick as Greipel or Cavendish but he is a very good sprinter and has consistently finished in the top four in sprint finishes. The key word here is consistently and that is what the green jersey should be awarded for. If a sprinter likes Greipel or Cavendish wins it then they deserve it. Equally if a more all-round type rider who contests all the sprints wins it then they deserve it too.   For me the archetypal green jersey winner is Sean Kelly who could not only win stages but also finish in the top ten on G.C.

peloton,3du8m5,all_mens_asses,21,Mon Jul 20 07:22:14 2015 UTC,"Sagan about the Coquard incident (in his English):  ""Coquard was angry with me in the finish, but I told him 'What I can do, I going on the front and you are on the right side, I want to go, no?' Is normal in the sprint.""  He also said that he feels that Kristoff blocked him a bit in the end, but repeated that ""This is the sprint"" and it's normal."
peloton,3du8m5,jwrider98,5,Sun Jul 19 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"I love how easygoing Sagan is. That said, if I were Coquard, I would punch Sagan in the dick and tell him never to do that again."
peloton,3du8m5,TirantMW,4,Sun Jul 19 23:34:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know if anyone else agrees, but I'm not happy with the fact there have been so few opportunities for bunch sprints this year. There have only been 4 stages that suit pure sprinters (5 if you include today.) Usually there are about 7 or 8, occasionally more. The organisers seem to be putting in a lot of flat stages but with climbs at the end to weed out sprinters, suiting a breakaway or a puncheur. I don't know why they have done this, it's like they're trying to turn sprinters away from the race. If this continues, will sprinters start looking at other races? Hopefully more fully flat stages will appear next year."
peloton,3du8m5,all_mens_asses,7,Sun Jul 19 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"The tour is more than a one year project. It's been happening ""forever"" and is probably going to continue ""forever"". Within that time span shifts occur. Which if you look at it within the context of only one year may appear to majorly favour certain types of finish/ stage profile. However when you look at it within the context of the whole history and potential future of the race, the changes are minor and you can be safe in the knowledge that it has been balanced out by past years and it's therefore safe to conclude that it will be balanced out in future years to come.  In other words, keep watching. I can guarantee you will get your fill of sprint stages."
peloton,3du8m5,redtoycar,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:40:51 2015 UTC,"I was a sprinter myself when competitive, so I've always liked the sprint stages best, but it's interesting to hear others say that they miss the bunch sprints (I've heard a couple commentators/journalists say the same). While I'm glad the puncheurs, who rarely get to feature in grand tours, are getting several days to claim stages, the finishes (imho) are actually not as fun to watch as a good old fashioned big bunch sprint. It's basically just watching 3 or 4 guys completely dump their ass out of their ass and limp across the line in slow motion like wounded animals."
peloton,3du8m5,tedfletcher,2,Sun Jul 19 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"In my beginner opinion it's more interesting overall with various breakaways. The finish willbe more cool tot watch in abunch sprint, but overall stages like today where its peloton from start tot finish are far less interesting."

peloton,3du8m5,chaosandfury84,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:00 2015 UTC,I do like/prefer the mountain stages but I agree that the equal variety is more enjoyable overall. For me the  most disappointing difference this year was that there was no big mountain on either weekend day.    I can only watch weekends live.  The only one will be this next Saturday and the race will most likely be fully decided.
peloton,3du8m5,LocusOfControl,3,Sun Jul 19 17:58:59 2015 UTC,"I think this year they were trying to tilt the favor for a rider like Quintana.

peloton,3du8m5,IM_THE_DECOY,0,Sun Jul 19 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"I expect you are being slightly facteious but I think that's a bit harsh. Within the context of a bike race, where cars and bikes/ motor bikes are everywhere, often in what appears to be mildly organised chaos, you have to accept that everyone will make positional errors at some point and any mistake made does not warrant punishment with ""physical violence"", or whatever you would classify chucking a bottle at someone is.  No real harm came from the bikers mistake, they were traveling at very slow speed and only made contact (if they did) due to Sagan kicking out. I'm sure that as soon as they realised their positional error they moved out of the way, the footage seems to confirm this.   I'm happy to write the motor bikes behaviour off as just one of those, what F1 would call, racing incidents where it appears to be an inevitable occurrence within the everyday happenings of a bike race and neither party is truly at fault. Up to the point where the bottle is thrown.  Edit: I've put way to much thought into this and none of it is meant to be in a malicious tone towards you :) Edit 2: What I do think is bullshit is punishing Yates when he didn't even throw the bottle... that is full retard."

peloton,3du8m5,detestrian,11,Sun Jul 19 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"Great video. It shows exactly what i suspect is Sagan's only tactical weak point of these sprints: With 1km to go, he's usually well set up around 3rd/4th wheel. Then, for whatever reason, he always loses a few positions, forcing him to sprint from 8th/10th wheel, going around peeled off leadout men, instead of staying 3rd/4th wheel and launching in the clear."
peloton,3du8m5,all_mens_asses,6,Sun Jul 19 17:24:55 2015 UTC,He never has a dedicated leadout man unlike the other contenders. I don't know how much of a difference that really makes but it's something to consider.
peloton,3du8m5,Ausrufepunkt,3,Sun Jul 19 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"That's true, and I think it can make a big difference. Renshaw often pulls cav to the front in the last 1k and drops Cav off 3rd wheel with 500m to go.   That said, I've definitely seen Cav fend for himself, without a leadout, and do a better job of being on the right wheel in time for the sprint than Sagan typically does."
peloton,3du8m5,Branston_Pickle,7,Sun Jul 19 20:55:56 2015 UTC,"I think the problem was the right corner, he didnt seem prepared while Greipel took the perfect position and immediately sprinted to gold after the corner"

Four of the best sprinters in the world right now.   Sagan didn't look very composed today. Tired from his efforts over the last few days?   Greipel and the Lotto lead-out was perfect. He's gotta be the favorite for the Champs-Elysees now, and perhaps for the Green Jersey. It depends on whether Sagan really goes for intermediates over the next few days.   Surprised that Cavendish wasn't at the finish, especially since he was climbing so well previously.   EDIT: Okay, so Cav is sick right now. That explains it."

He often seems to struggle with turning over a gear and needing a good lead out so he doesn't have to ""jump"" but instead simply mash his opponents into submission (much like Kristoff, who also likes a long sprint).

He can push 1900 watts, but it is at 105 RPM (taken from SRM.de, 2011 TDU Adelaide circuit). My comments are based on years of watching him struggle to win unless he was delivered to the front with a perfect lead out. That's why his first win at this year's Tour impressed me - he won a ""messy"" sprint after being boxed in.   It seems like he always had the power but lacked a savage acceleration which gave me the impression of grinding out a sprint instead of having a real jump like Cav or other guys with a track background."

Or when the other riders cross the line?  I'm assuming the former, right?   For example, it looks like Kristoff and Degenkolb may have swapped spots as they hit the line, but Degenkolb was immediately declared second by the NBCSN announcers based on the photo of Greipel hitting the line."

peloton,3du8m5,cLarke23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:24:19 2015 UTC,I assumed it was as they hit the line. But maybe for a sprint finish it's classed as when the winner hits the line and that's it.
peloton,3du8m5,isthisdutch,5,Sun Jul 19 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"Definitely where they cross the line, not when the leader crossed. There are sprint points to be given out so it matters."

peloton,3du8m5,Jaeger-bomb-bastic,4,Sun Jul 19 15:34:56 2015 UTC,He initiated contact at least once.
peloton,3du8m5,Davidmuful,12,Sun Jul 19 15:21:31 2015 UTC,Shouldn't Sagan be relegated for pushing Coquard in the sprint? He's always a bit like that but too dangerous today.
peloton,3du8m5,Davidmuful,2,Sun Jul 19 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"Eh, tough call. Coq was also going too slow and came up on Sagan and boxed him in. It would be different if Sagan came from behind but he had been up there for a bit and was slightly edging Coquard out anyway, and then took a gap that was a bit too tight."

peloton,3du8m5,cavendishasriel,4,Sun Jul 19 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"I remember that being horrible, I thought Cav should have been penalised then too but you're right if they didn't punish that they won't now."
peloton,3du8m5,Davidmuful,2,Sun Jul 19 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"Eh, Veelers looked over his shoulder and veered to the right into Cavs line when there was a left bend. Tried (and succeeded) to upset Cavs sprint and then moaned like a bitch about eating some Tarmac. Got what he deserved."

peloton,3du8m5,Jaeger-bomb-bastic,3,Sun Jul 19 17:04:46 2015 UTC,"My read on it: Veelers most certainly saw Cav and let a gap open in front of him in an attempt to block, which is totally legal and a very standard tactic. I don't think Veelers ""swerved"" into Cav.   But Cav knew the stakes and was like oh fck no dude, and went around, adrenaline pumping, pissed as hell, and said I'm getting that wheel, if he won't yield to me he'll get what he gets. Veelers didn't yield, Cav braced for impact, and his shoulder just happened to hit Veelers' lower arm, sending him right to the ground.  I don't think either rider intentionally ""swerved"" into the other. It was two cyclists failing to yield to each other, and it was unlucky that Cav's shoulder hit Veelers' lower arm."
peloton,3du8m5,cavendishasriel,6,Sun Jul 19 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"How biased could you be? Veelers was in front and won the position, that doesn't justify knocking him to the ground."
peloton,3du8m5,nnth,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:43 2015 UTC,If he'd have kept his line he wouldn't have been.
peloton,3du8m5,Jaeger-bomb-bastic,6,Sun Jul 19 16:41:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you've actually seen the incident but Veelers is going backwards through the middle of the bunch sprint, and even checks his shoulder before cutting up Cav. Even Kittel has sympathy with Cav in the documentary 'Clean Spirit' and an awkward moment ensues at the dinner table when Kittel says he understands Cav's position that the bikes were going for the same space. The problem is that Cav has the right to go for that space because he's cornering. Fuck knows what Veelers was doing. To say he got what he deserved is harsh, but he should probably not be fucking around like that in a sprint."
peloton,3du8m5,nnth,3,Sun Jul 19 18:15:13 2015 UTC,"Of course I've seen it. There's a difference between veering off your line and elbowing someone off their bike, the only way you can't see that is bias."
peloton,3du8m5,Jaeger-bomb-bastic,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's a big difference! If someone is veering off their line and slowing down you're going to hit them. I don't think Cav meant to take him out, just push him away, something that happens in a bunch sprint ALL THE TIME (as Sagan demonstrated today)."

Sagan dominates the green jersey because he is there day after day in the breakaways and can put a decent sprint in too. Greipel is all about stage wins really.

peloton,3dvab4,edlll91,15,Sun Jul 19 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"There's been some really interesting articles and data from the ascent of La Pierre-Saint Martin from both sides of the argument. I believe the accepted best standard of working out w/kg (and the one which we benchmark Armstrong, Pantani et al on all the ascents from 10 years ago) is the Dr Ferrari method, which put Froome at 6.09w/kg. I have no idea how this French guy got this figure of 7.04 but it's important to remember that his methodology needs to be examined and because it's clearly not the same as the Dr. Ferrari method, it can't be compared to historical data. He also seems to think that Froome is 71kg, and he isn't.   Ross Tucker (who is definitely one of the better writers on the subject of performance) estimates that Froome must have done 6.3-6.5w/kg in the second half of the climb (the time from his attack to the finish was ~14.30) because the pace in the second half was faster. This would be difficult to achieve after riding at ~5.9w/kg for the first half, and would give him a VO2max of 90ml/kg/min or more. To put that into perspective, Quintana's is 86 (measured). However, the effects of drafting are almost always ignored in this data. It's very significant, because for the first 26.30 of the climb Froome was behind a team mate. Dr Ferrari (him again - for those who are new to cycling and the TdF, he was the guy who trained USPS and Lance Armstrong, including the doping part; he's widely regarded as not just an expert on doping but cycling science in general) estimates the effect at 20kmph to be 20-25w of saving. We know that the climb for the first half was about this speed with some fluctuations (because the effect of drafting is exponential, more variance = more power saving, so I'm being conservative). If Froome saves 20w for the first half of the climb then his power/kg (at 68kg) goes from 5.9 to 5.6, a big saving, and one that no doubt has an effect on Tucker's calculated VO2 max (I'm not smart enough to know by how much, sadly).    Would love to hear anyone else's perspective on this. There's plenty of good discussion to be had from these numbers and I'm in no way convinced that Froome is completely 'clean' (TUEs for asthma, for example)."
peloton,3dvab4,nnth,3,Mon Jul 20 00:16:59 2015 UTC,"Nice to have all those numbers here. As far as I know the absence of a Froome's VO2 values are the missing piece of the puzzle and we'll probably speculate a lot until he/sky decides to do the test.   I think most of us here don't have enough knowledge to give a better insight than those we read around the web, at least I don't! :)"
peloton,3dvab4,pyrignis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:08:08 2015 UTC,"I, personally, strongly doubt sky doesn't have it. It is such a critical value to understand the potential of your rider and figure out where he stands. Sky has to be the most professional and scientific team in their approach. All on their routine have been carefully studied to optimize performances... As a team manager you have to know this value. Maybe not through the standard test but you have to have this kind of info. Even amateur teams will test the VO2 values of their rider. This comes before power meter data."
peloton,3dvab4,chainpress,6,Mon Jul 20 23:25:31 2015 UTC,"TUEs for asthma   Sigh. Not this nonsense again...  Asthma medication isn't, generally, banned when taken from an inhaler except in very high doses, such as the Ulissi case. Even then it wouldn't benefit your performance unless you actually had asthma. Froome received a TUE for prenisolone, which is not asthma medication, to treat an acute chest infection."
peloton,3dvab4,all_mens_asses,0,Mon Jul 20 06:03:52 2015 UTC,"Here's what bugs me: Brailsford said team Sky would never apply for a TUE if a rider is sick, but instead pull them from the race no questions asked.  And yet in 2014, Froome was seen puffing Corticosteroids (banned substance that enhances performance) during the Tour de Romandie, which he ended up winning, justified by a TUE for a chest infection they had to apply for the day of the race (you typically need 7 days for a UCI panel of doctors to review it). Although the TUE was totally legal, and Froome was said to have a chest infection (I have one right now, and I'm useless on a bike).. that's still saying one thing and doing another.  Now, I am genuinely not saying they're doped up, I don't have enough data. But this kind of stuff fits right into the narrative of ""Sky the deceivers."" Sky keeps saying they're gonna be different, yet their actions look a lot like the teams that have come before them, and their riders keep turning out performances that (some) credible sports scientists seem to find dubious.  If nothing else, it perpetuates what I consider to be a skepticism that is wholly and completely earned."
peloton,3dvab4,chainpress,6,Mon Jul 20 12:24:28 2015 UTC,"The inhaler, not banned, was in the Dauphin√©. The TUE was in Romandie.   This is why the Internet Anti-Doping Jihad look so bad. They can't get the basic facts right."

peloton,3dvab4,0_0_7,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:27 2015 UTC,"There was another analysis Tucker did of a climb a while back where he states that Sorensen rode at 6.7w/kg for almost 12 minutes and that was perfectly fine. So why is 6.7w/kg fine, but 6.3/6.4 for 1430 unrealistic?"
peloton,3dvab4,all_mens_asses,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:05:16 2015 UTC,"This is a good question which, to me, reveals the challenge of analyzing power data. People tend to slice it and dice it, and remove context in an act of confirmation bias (not saying you're doing that, just using the question as an example).  The answer is in the context. Namely, when that power was put down. If Froome put out this power on the third consecutive day in the mountains, during the last 3-5km of the last climb of the day, that would be different than on the first day after a rest day.   You don't need a PhD in Kinesiology to know that riding fast up mountains has a both an inter- and intra-day cumulative effect on your power output, so the last section of the last climb on the third day is gonna be considerably slower than your peak capabilities.  I don't know the context of the Sorenson analysis you cite, maybe you could provide some color there?

I'm looking at a ride I just did this morning, on one of the short 5 minute climbs,  there was one where I did like 5:01 at 188w, a couple weeks ago, the same climb, same bike, 5:38 at 188w. This is with a power meter. There is so much variation."
peloton,3dvab4,all_mens_asses,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:22:14 2015 UTC,"It's calculated by people who are experts in sports kinesiology , so that's one thing. Note: Just because they're masters doesn't imply they're unbiased.  I didn't take them that seriously until recently, when Froome's power data up Ventoux in 2013 TDF lined up almost exactly with the Ferrari method estimates. Like, within 1%.  Still, the (imo valid) counter-argument is we don't know how accurate that power data is. It could have been mis-calibrated, partially, or totally falsified."
peloton,3dvab4,zelenoid,10,Mon Jul 20 14:32:29 2015 UTC,It takes about a minute to find out that Froome doesn't weigh 71kg.
peloton,3dvab4,Hubertoi,5,Sun Jul 19 21:26:48 2015 UTC,Well that would make his numbers per kilo even more ridiculously high.
peloton,3dvab4,sh545,7,Mon Jul 20 00:50:34 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, because it would require less power to do the climb. The effect would depend on the calculation this guy is doing."
peloton,3dvab4,nnth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:11:34 2015 UTC,It doesn't. If you use DrF method it makes no difference. The climbing speed is almost a measurement of w/kg anyway. It's natural if he weighs less then he doesn't need to generate so many watts. Understand?
peloton,3dvab4,all_mens_asses,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, whoever did that calculation is way, way, way off. The Ferrari method was within 1% error when compared with the leaked numbers on Froome's 2013 Ventoux climb. If their calculation is that far off the Ferrari numbers, it can be written off imo.   Incidentally, those 2013 Ventoux numbers looked, in the estimation of many (even staunch skeptics), entirely plausible for a clean rider."

I especially think it's funny that nobody looks as Contador or Nibili after their personal and team involvement in doping, respectively."
peloton,3dvab4,chickendance638,7,Sun Jul 19 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest reason that people suspect Froome is because before 2011 he was, by all measures, a weak pro. In order to justify his performances now, he must have been born one of the most physically gifted riders in the history of human kind (not hyperbole). However, he doesn't show dominance in his career/palmares that is consistent with those kinds of genetic gifts. In 2011, he just ""came out of nowhere"" and started flying up mountains.  There are a lot of possible explanations for this, and I'm not saying he isn't that gifted. I am compelled by evidence and data, and I no longer give anyone in the pro peloton the benefit of the doubt. We've been burned way too many times. I won't accuse anyone, but I won't endorse them until they at least justify (through independent testing) the physiology required to do 6.1 W/kg for 41 minutes."
peloton,3dvab4,xray606,8,Mon Jul 20 12:54:30 2015 UTC,"I find it normal that they concentrate their efforts on the yellow jersey, you have to understand that everytime a tour de France winner is proven guilty afterwards it is another nail in this race's coffin. Sky is/was holding the true intel , (theses leaked graphs don't mean much , getting conclusion from it without the rest is just food for medias) and considering how dominant they are as a whole it obviously raises suspicions. Sadly the argument of "" there is no secret just hard work"" has been proven false in the past by Armstrong."

If you excuse me, I think that's quite a na√Øve comment. I'd say that the opinion on this sub about Astana is worse than the opinion about sky. And if Froome is performing way better than those you think deserve more attention, why shouldn't he be scrutinized?  But I'm with you regarding the power graphing stuff, and some try to conclude things they can't conclude from those outputs."
peloton,3dvab4,Pek-Man,8,Sun Jul 19 22:46:45 2015 UTC,I meant media-wise. It seems like all the media focus right now is on Froome/Sky in regards to doping.
peloton,3dvab4,shandyhawk4,11,Sun Jul 19 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"I've said the same since the start. Astana had 5 positives in a year, and one possible indication on a guy for this race... Barely even talked about. But Froome does well, and it's nothing but doping talk. People talk more about doping when you do well, than they do when you actually get caught doping. The mentality seems to be that... as long as you don't do well, nobody cares if you cheat."
peloton,3dvab4,chickendance638,4,Mon Jul 20 05:17:59 2015 UTC,"If we focus on Sky, I think that's happening because of the performances of Thomas and Porte. While Porte's performance is not that unexpected, Thomas is surprising most people, specially those who don't follow the whole cycling season. The fact that there's a team clearly above the rest gathers media attention, including suspicious people, the same way most were hating on Astana due to their Giro dominance (despite the fact that Contador was winning anyway)."
peloton,3dvab4,aimbo,4,Sun Jul 19 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"Sky employed the doctor Geert Leinders from 2010 to 2012. Geert Leinders got a lifetime ban from sport earlier this year, because of his work at Rabobank. It is not easy to get a lifetime ban, so it is certainly something to be suspicious about. The years he was employed, were also the time when Froome went from donkey to race horse."
peloton,3dvab4,yesat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:11:03 2015 UTC,"Froome's success came out of the blue in the 2011 Vuelta, when he was on the verge of losing his spot on Team Sky. Actually, he was close to not even being on the roster for the Vuelta. He mentions this in his autobiography. Before this Froome was nothing. No big results, unlike Contador and Quintana, who were stars and great riders at a very early age, i.e. before they turned pro. Froome's sudden rise is reason for suspicion, taking the circumstances into account. Froome's incentive for doping was enormous in 2011. I think that this is why Froome is questioned as much as he is."

Coyle says Armstrong is the only human who has been shown to change his muscle efficiency.   Damn, that sounds similar.

Did he ask for profiles when a very injured Contador was out-pacing Froome at any point last year in the Vuelta? Yes, no bias to be seen here.   In the meantime, it was Froome who mentioned there were no checks in the Teide last year. It was Froome who first said it would be a great idea to do night-checks while the French teams were losing their shit over it. It is Sky (along with BMC) who are pushing for power passport.  Oh, yeah, and the ""study"" that Sallet put out was a piece of sensationalist junk that had no claim at being science.

It's silly to even think it has even the slightest importance.  France television literally got shat on by everybody else in France, for not saying anything about the assumption of doping on Amstrong. They were constantly defending him, in an attempt to defend the sport as an all. It doesn't sound good when the guy who win everything for several years is cheating, it's not a good publicity, so it's better to close eyes and act like if nothing is wrong...  As long as Amstrong wasn't caught, he was 100% innocent for them and out of doubt, and saying anything about the rumor wouldn't have been good for them. Even back then, a lot of people would criticize them for that stance. After the Amstrong era, nothing changed, saying they have doubt on a cyclist wasn't even a possibility. Even when it was obvious as fuck.  So when literally all the cyclists they kept defending for years got caught one by one, France Television suffered really harsh critics from literally everybody.   So now, since they can't pretend anymore that doping is not a huge problem in cyclism, they talks about it. The Tour has lost all its credibility in these last 15 years because of doping and the audience suffered because of that. It's a serious matter, and that's why we now have doubts on everybody.  That has absolutely nothing to do with the nationality of the cyclist."

peloton,3dvab4,big_al11,7,Sun Jul 19 22:17:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't know Froome was ""at war"" with Jalabert, I follow the stage on France Television but not much of the drama around, and I found Jalabert very respectful of the racers. In my opinion, he does a great job at explaining what's happening, why, how and what will likely be the outcome of theirs tactics and behaviour.  And he is a very articulate guy, a very good speaker actually, much better than the professional journalist at his side (this one is a pain to listen to).  Anyway, during the live commentaries on stage, I didn't notice any bad words towards Froome or Sky Team in particular, certainly not about doping. I think the only ""bad things"" I heard him say is that sometimes, Froome and some of his team-mates may appears a bit arrogant. For instance, in some stage, Jalabert have said that Sky Team attitude, (I don't remember the particular, what they did exactly) was not going to make them more loved by the others guy in the peloton.  But nothing too harsh, he was just explaining the mindset of a peloton and what was usually the general reaction to a particular team or racer tactic.   tl;dr : I don't know what Jalabert specifically said about Froome to start this ""war"", but overall, Jalabert seems very respectful of the racers in his live commentaries."
peloton,3dvab4,madindehead,2,Mon Jul 20 00:36:03 2015 UTC,"Here you can see what Jalabert said from ITV's perspective. Froome's wife tweeted about Jalabert (then deleted the tweets) and Froome himself did it today. Also, thank you for you perspective, it's good to have these insights."
peloton,3dvab4,0_0_7,6,Mon Jul 20 00:41:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the video, what Jalabert said (in a radio interview actually and not on live TV) is that in the stage climb there was a world between Froome and the others.   And I think everybody saw it: Nibali, contador, Quintana, Valverde  attacked, again and again, Froome easily responded. And when Froome attacked, all the GC contenders were left behind, some like stuck on the road.   However you look at it, you can deny that it was impressive. That what he said. Of course, being a media, you can milk it and read it like is saying Froome is doping, but I heard him said almost the same things about others racers when in a climb for instance, there is one guy who is clearly ahead of the pack, everybody struggle and one just seem comfortable and in much better form, stay seated on his saddle and can turn is legs faster.  About ""verging on the ridiculous"", the interviewer make it sound like he is talking about Froome perfomances. Actually he is talking about the time lost by some of the GC contenders, specifically Nibali who just exploded and lost more than 4 minutes in a few kilometres. This is why at the end of the interview before Jalabert get in the bus, he is saying ""I didn't said that"", and the guy on screen later said something like ""we heard him say it"".  And I understand the attacks on Jalabert about doping, because like all racers of this time, is not clean, everybody knows it, and he knows that everybody knows, and I often thought that it was one of the reason he was carefully avoiding talking about doping in his commentaries, because it could come back to bite him in the ass.  Sorry for my broken English and if I sound like a Jalabert fanboy, which I am not, but I think this polemic is a bit unfair, even more so if you're trying to tie the piss throwing to what Jalabert said."

For me it's a complex situation, since according to me both side are right.  I completly agree with Froome when he said, he received piss mostly because of what the media and obviously Jalabert said about him.   But at the same time, nobody in the media asked to throw bottle of piss over Froome. The only thing Jalabert said was that he had doubt over Froome's performance. And for me that's his job.  I understand that Froome can be angry, but he's taking it too far. His rent on the social media is silly. It's not Jalabert's fault if people are stupid.  If i started following the Tour on Eurosport instead of France Television, it's mainly because i couldn't stand the commentators sucking the dick of Amstrong, and defending him. It made me cringe to hear everybody praising him, while at the same time most of their audience deeply know he was doped and it was just a matter of time until it was proved. Deep down i'm pretty sure even the commentators weren't beliving the shit they were saying, and that's what made it even worse.  I hugely prefer a commentator which is honest with what he's thinking and say it if he has doubt over a cyclist, than a cocksucker who will lie to himself.  In the end if Froome is not doped that's unfortunate, and he suffered because of the doubt of Jallabert. But Jallabert's job is to commentate what he's seeing and say what he's thinking, not to be nice with Froome."

peloton,3dubeg,L_Dawg,4,Sun Jul 19 16:00:31 2015 UTC,"If he's not too tired, I'll pick Kwiatkowski. Good descending skills, and his climbing is improving. Plus, he has an excellent sprint finish if he can't distance the group.   My wildcard pick is Michael Matthews. He got 8th today in the group sprint, and he said that Gap is a target of his. On his good days, he climbs better than any punchy sprinter, even Sagan, so we'll see if his ribs have recovered enough."
peloton,3dubeg,Ham_Authority95,9,Sun Jul 19 16:05:44 2015 UTC,"Hoping on Nibali winning and possibly even taking some time, not for the GC but just as a psychological win. My list:   Vincenzo Nibali Jakob Fuglsang Alejandro Valverde Roman Kreuziger Dan Martin"
peloton,3dubeg,WiWoWard,3,Sun Jul 19 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"I could see Valverde, Nibali, and Contador taking some time on the descent tomorrow and Sky letting them get a little bit, not to risk the jersey. I don't see Martin getting anywhere. I don't think he has the descending skills to do this, and his climbing probably isn't good enough right now. Froome can afford to lose a little time on the descent if its risky, but TVG can't. That's the one I'm worried about."
peloton,3dubeg,chaosandfury84,5,Sun Jul 19 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"If the 2013 stage into Gap is any indicator, Froome isn't likely to let anyone important get away from him on the descent."

peloton,3dubeg,Sappert,4,Sun Jul 19 17:19:32 2015 UTC,"I can see Rolland winning (or getting a top 5 spot) if he's allowed to get in the breakaway. I thought that this scenario was going to happen yesterday. But IAM didn't want it to happen because Rolland would be overtaking Mathias Frank in the GC and they decided to chase down the breakaway. I considered this to be pretty early to secure / hold onto a GC spot, with all of the Alps yet to come, but IAM did so yesterday and they will therefore be doing the same if Rolland tries to get in the breakaway tomorrow.  On a side note, while I'm not necessarily a fan of Rolland (nor opposed to him, I pretty much like all cyclists), I did subscribe to /r/olland because those guys really make me laugh. I'd recommend it!"
peloton,3dubeg,_scholar_,3,Sun Jul 19 17:43:08 2015 UTC,Breakaway for the win.  GC action to watch = Nibali & Contador attack and perhaps Sky try test Quintana's descending  TJVG to hang on for dear life.  If it does all come together I'll pick Bardet to attack over the top and solo away for the win
peloton,3dubeg,charliemann,3,Sun Jul 19 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"My tip for tomorrows stage is Michael Matthews. Finally, he is closing in on being in decent shape(good sprint today) and he and the Orica boys must be quite hungry for some success after what a horrible start to the TDF!

peloton,3dubeg,LocusOfControl,2,Sun Jul 19 19:56:16 2015 UTC,I think Rodriguez is going to take his third tomorrow. Today he let go of the bunch early again to take time so I expect him in the break tomorrow and drop everyone on the last climb in the same fashion as his second stage win.

There are 2 scenarios. 1 - all teams will send their potential winners to the breakaway, 2 - some teams will decide to wait with attacks until final climb. First one is unpredictable. Bardet may win or Fuglsang. But its really hard to predict. Second scenario is some team like Astana control breakaway and catch it before last climb. Then they should set high tempo to drop as many riders as they can. Then Nibali attack, descend, win. In this scenario Id say it's Nibali or Valverde. But if descend is not technical, then every team will try to stick with first option - breakaway."
peloton,3dubeg,Mattho,3,Sun Jul 19 16:41:37 2015 UTC,DIE sprint DIE
peloton,3dubeg,zelenoid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:04 2015 UTC,"Sky will (as usual) let a breakaway go far far away, and if Movistar or Astana chase, that will be pretty obvious. A descent attack is pretty pointless if you know to expect it.  (Not sure how it would help Movistar anyway, Quintana can't descent out of a bag)  So, break will win it."
peloton,3dubeg,P1mpathinor,8,Sun Jul 19 17:01:12 2015 UTC,"A descent attack is pretty pointless if you know to expect it.   I disagree. Descending is a skill. If you're a talented descender, gaining time on a descent can be as natural as gaining time on a climb. If you're Froome and you see Nibali attacking on a technical descent, I don't even think it would be in Froome's best interest to follow Nibali. If you don't have the technical capabilities, which Froome seems to be lacking, it can be outright dangerous to try and follow a gifted descender like Nibali. You risk crashing and outright losing the Tour. Grand tours have been won on a descent. Paolo Salvodelli did it in 2005. Sure, you'll always need other skills as well, but if you can keep up in time trialling and in the mountains, the difference can be made in a descent.   Sky will (as usual) let a breakaway go far far away   Are you referring to the 2013 Tour, I can't immediately remember the breakaways back then? In this Tour, only the breakaway in the stage in which Rodriguez got his second victory got a large time bonus. Apart from that, this hasn't been the Tour for breakaways so far. However you're right, it can definitely happen tomorrow.   Not sure how it would help Movistar anyway, Quintana can't descent out of a bag   I agree with you on Quintana. However, with Valverde, Movistar still has another GC contender currently placed 4th. It's still possible for Valverde to win this Tour with a good amount of luck and great tactics. I think it would be foolish of Movistar not to take advantage of this. Valverde is a decent descender as well and while I don't think he can regain a lot of time tomorrow, simply letting Valverde attack on the climb or the descent will make the race a lot harder for Sky to control. It can put some doubt in Froome's mind."
peloton,3dubeg,P1mpathinor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:33:47 2015 UTC,Why does everyone think Froome is a bad descender? He admittedly doesn't like risky descending but that doesn't mean he's bad at it.
peloton,3dubeg,all_mens_asses,5,Sun Jul 19 20:30:13 2015 UTC,"He admittedly doesn't like risky descending but that doesn't mean he's bad at it.   Well, it kind of does. Of course it depends on who you compare him to. He's below average in the peloton, which means he can lose time in the discipline. He's way better than I am though. Mark Cavendish is an awesome climber if you compare him to me.   /u/all_mens_asses described it very well. He's not necessarily 'bad', he's just worse than his competitors tomorrow. Descending is a bit like F1 racing. You need to be able to choose the optimal 'racing line'. And you need to have the guts to slow down less than the other guys. And you need to be aerodynamic. Just check out these video's (the first three are about a minute in length, the last two are a bit longer):   Paolo Salvodelli descending (he arrives at the 20 second mark. Seriously, watch this!) Samuel Sanchez descending (and eating a gel while he's at it, still gaining terrain on his competitors) Vincenzo Nibali descending Romain Bardet descending (No, Nibali didn't catch up. This is actually the exact same stage we're going to see wednesday) Fabian Cancellara descending (hope you like classical music)   Compare this to Froome's descent tomorrow and I'm sure you'll immediately notice the difference."
peloton,3dubeg,noideawhatshappening,0,Sun Jul 19 22:52:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it kind of does.   How so? You can dislike something without being bad at it.   He's below average in the peloton   Again based on what? Yeah he's not as good at descending as the sprinters, but none of the GC guys are. There aren't any videos of Froome doing an awesome solo descent, that's because he doesn't like to attack on descents and is hardly ever dropped on the climbs beforehand. But he doesn't let rivals get away on descents when it matters.   he's just worse than his competitors tomorrow   Nibali is probably better, but the rest? Tejay, Contador, and Valverde are solid descenders but not really anything special (heck Contador fell while unsuccessfully trying to drop Froome on this same descent into Gap in 2013), and Quintana really isn't a good descender (by pro standards)."
peloton,3dubeg,Mattho,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:32:11 2015 UTC,"You can dislike something without being bad at it.   You're right. But, being good at something you dislike is mostly due to being talented at that something. Not often do people put in the effort to become good at things they dislike. Certainly not to an expert level. Than the question becomes 'Is Froome talented at descending?' Or 'Did he put in the effort even though he dislikes it?'  When I mentioned Froome being below average in the peloton, I did mean to include every single one of the riders left in this Tour. He's [probably] worse than most of the sprinters, the mountainbikers and some other guys that just have that natural descending ability. That would already be half. But maybe he isn't [a lot] worse than his direct competitors for the GC or in tomorrow's stage (assuming all of the sprinters will have dropped). I think we can agree he's worse than Nibali, Bardet and probably Valverde. But as for the others - you're right, I can't say for sure. My feeling is that he is... but that's not an argument I want to use in this discussion. I'm out of real arguments and you definitely make some valid points.  Anyway, thanks for responding. You've got me convinced that I might be prejudiced. I will be keeping an eye on Froome's descending skills tomorrow and (maybe even more importantly) in stage 17. Let's hope one of the talented descenders like Nibali does attack and we'll be able to judge Froome's reaction to it, otherwise we'll be none the wiser."
peloton,3dubeg,noideawhatshappening,3,Sun Jul 19 23:58:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think Froome's a bad descender, but there's a strong case to be made that he's not nearly as good as Nibali, Contador, Sagan, Evans, or other contenders...   Tirreno-Adriatico 2013 (lost the race when Nibali attacked on descent and took time) TDF 2013 Stage 16 (He got all whiny that Contador was taking too many risks) Dauphin√© Stage 6 (Crash)   there's more but google is proving really redundant on this topic"
peloton,3dubeg,P1mpathinor,4,Sun Jul 19 21:51:43 2015 UTC,In the stage where he was whiny contandor was the one who nearly lost it and froome had to avoid him. I think that was why he complained about the risky descending. I may be wrong but that's what my memory seems to recall happening.
peloton,3dubeg,adriankg,4,Sun Jul 19 22:41:12 2015 UTC,Contador also crashed descending in (tdf) 2014.
peloton,3dubeg,grevemoeskr,2,Mon Jul 20 08:25:23 2015 UTC,I forgot about that. Definitely seems like Froome will risk enough descending if needed to defend his lead.
peloton,3dubeg,UnitedRoad18,2,Mon Jul 20 11:15:18 2015 UTC,"Tirreno-Adriatico 2013   IIRC Froome had already been dropped on the 27% climb before Nibali got away from Contador on the descent.    TDF 2013 Stage 16   Contador had attacked on the descent and Froome was right on his wheel. Then Contador crashed in a corner, forcing Froome off the road but he managed to stay upright. Hardly a testament to a lack of skill on Froome's part.  As for the Dauphine crash, Nibali and Contador have both crashed on descents as much as Froome has in the past few years.  The ""Froome is bad at descending"" sentiment just seems to me a lot like the ""Froome is bad at cobbles"" notion that was popular before stage 4 of this Tour; it gets repeated a bunch and so everyone starts to take it as fact but it's not really based on much."

According to Marc Seargant, one of Lotto-Soudal's managers, Greipel's only focus from now on is the Champs-√âlys√©es stage. He thinks Sagan is really determined to get that green jersey. (Dutch source)  I believe him. However, supposing that's not completely true and they are still willing to put up a battle for the green jersey and want the points for the intermediate sprint tomorrow, they'd have to control the race for two hours. That's pretty hard. Might be better to get Greipel in the early breakaway.  One a side note, 'LTB' is a bit dated since that would be last year's Lotto-Belisol."

But tomorrow we're talking about a climb that goes on for 9KM. The climbs in the Brabantse Pijl only go on for about 1KM. That makes a difference. Also, the participants list isn't comparable to the Tour. There are barely any climbers such as Nibali or Valverde at the start of the Brabantse Pijl. I can see Sagan win it tomorrow, but only in a breakaway really.  I had a lot of fun rewatching that video though, thanks for sharing!"
