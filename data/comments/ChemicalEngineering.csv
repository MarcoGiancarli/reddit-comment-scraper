If you care a lot about her, and think that you two are a good fit, you could marry her. That is how my spouse found a job.   Honestly, I don't think internationals should take jobs unless they get married. Tech companies have been using international talent to kind of subsidize their profit margin.  There is a current trend in some tech industries to hire H1B visa holders for salaries that undercut the job market, this hurts those international job seekers as well as their American counterparts."

My gf is very staunch in the idea that her success must come from herself and she would like to have peace of mine when finding a job and knowing that it was her hard work and dedication that came to fruition, not simply her bf marrying her.  However, I do understand the unfortunate realities of how difficult her circumstances are. I agree that marriage would be a way to help her situation but I also understand the type of strain it could potentially place on a relationship.... When we talked about this idea before, she was worried that it might prove to be a fracture point in our relationship later on."

Unless your gf, went to MIT or Stanford or Princeton or a name brand Mid Western college like UW Madison, UMN Twin Cities or Purdue or similar universities, it is tough out for ChemEngs.  If she's as great as you say, maybe she can get a professor to write a letter for grad school which might help her prospects of landing a job afterwards and by then she might get her Green Card or US Citizenship.   She should also join professional clubs like SWE, AICHE, SHPE (PS : you don't have to be Hispanic to join )"

ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,A-flat_Ketone,7,Mon Jul 20 16:41:20 2015 UTC,"There isn't an answer to this question. The type of work ChemEs end up doing is so diverse that I would say there is no such thing as a ""typical chemical engineer.""  You need to narrow your search a little bit. What kind of industry are you interested in? There is a heavy ChemE presence in oil, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, food and beverage, aviation, etc. Find the industries that interest you and start investigating what the major players in that company do. Look at the job postings, what kind of skills do they require?   In terms of graduate school, it is a mistake to go unless you know what type of industry you want to get into. You need to pick a school that offers graduate level courses and conducts research relevant to your industrial interest. For example, if you wanted to go into semiconductors, you would want to find a program that offered courses in semiconductor physics and processing that also has professors doing research on those subjects. Your graduate degree is near worthless unless you tailor it to a specific industry."
ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,Jokiesamoster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. I'm so surface level with this stuff I had never even considered it. Honestly, given my math and physics background, I'm worried that grad schools would turns their backs to me. Any knowledge there by any chance?  ""Specialize"" has been something of a dirty word for me looking into chemistry jobs. What with the chemistry job market, narrowing my skills rather than broadening them seemed to hurt more than help. How does the demand for chemical engineers, regardless of field, look? Or again do I need to consider that in specializing?"
ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,IAmA_realmermaid,4,Mon Jul 20 17:17:12 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a particular interest right now I would say don't specialize. I know people with a MS in ChemE that get a plant process engineer job (although, I find this silly bc the same job comes with a BS in ChemE). I just got a BS in ChemE and had no trouble getting a job (I had a 3 term co-op and >3.5 GPA) but it seems like other redditors have had trouble.   I think a ChemE MS would definitely broaden your job choices compared to a BS in chemistry (even to other engineering jobs - mine is technically a MechE job role).   also- nice username!"
ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,sbMT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Do you know anything about my chances of getting accepted to a grad school considering my course load? It's technically a degree in biochemistry, but we take all the same courses save for calc3 and pchem 2."
ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,IAmA_realmermaid,3,Mon Jul 20 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"Relevant background chiming in. I have a BS in biochemistry and went straight to grad school for a MS in chem engineering. In addition to the normal chem/biochem undergrad curriculum, I took a differential eqns class, two semesters of transport, and a reaction engineering class, all of which were part of the undergrad chem eng curriculum. Of those, the diff eqns class was by far the most critical to my success in the graduate chem eng curriculum. Every grad class I took was really math-heavy & theoretical, so if you feel confident with math and your transcript shows you being successful in the math classes you have taken, that will help. I also had to take pchem 2 and a class that was half calc 3 & half ODEs for my biochem degree. So I felt pretty well prepared for and was successful in the graduate-level curriculum in chem eng. Of course, I had to fill in some gaps myself, but I got away with not needing to take any remedial/undergrad courses during grad school (save for one semester of an optional design course).   As far as getting into a grad program goes, there are loads of factors. You're probably not going to get into a school like MIT or Stanford, but if you set your sites on a mid-tier engineering school, I think you will find some programs that will be happy to take you. Find professors at schools you are interested in, learn about their research, and reach out to them if their work interests you. This can really help increase your chances of acceptance (and goes for chemistry or chem eng grad school)!"
ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,Jokiesamoster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you, all of that was incredibly helpful and uplifting. Here's the lowly biochem major that thought a chance at engineering was far from possible finding hope.  It looks like I won't be able to take diff equ before I graduate. I would have to take calc 3 to meet the prerequisite and I have massive labs and classes I have to fit in if I want to finish my degree on time.   How bad of a situation does that put me in? I guess I'm a little skeptical because I always thought of engineering as incredibly selective and math intensive. My resume simply doesn't show that. Do you think I would be accepted under the condition that I take certain engineering courses as well as get caught up on my math?  Thank you for all the help. This is really great."
ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,Jokiesamoster,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:39 2015 UTC,Pchem2 is super unimportant (IMO) but they will probably have you take the math/physics courses that you haven't had yet. DE/Cal1-4/physics are usually pre-reqs for upper level ChE. I haven't ever looked into MS ChE requirements though - I want a MS in Process Safety.
ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,Jokiesamoster,2,Mon Jul 20 20:23:30 2015 UTC,"Graduate school is all about specializing. You can't contribute original research unless you are an expert in a certain field. That's not to say you will be limited in the skills you learn, it's the exact opposite. You have to do nearly every part of your experiment yourself, there isn't another department to ship work off to like you'd have in a big company. You get exposure to a ton of different things, but it is within the context of your specialization.   In terms of getting into graduate school it is all about developing a relationship with the research faculty. Faculty have an ""auto admit"" option for students. You need to look into their research and write them an email explaining how your experience can contribute to it. If you can convince someone you will be a valuable member of their team, you will be accepted.  The job market is pretty industry specific as well. People who don't network, don't do internships, and who have sub 3.5 GPAs are going to have trouble finding positions. Those that do are totally fine. Like the other poster said, a general, non-thesis MS doesn't hurt, but it doesn't help either. In all likelihood it won't get you a pay bump and you'll still only be qualified for the same jobs as someone with a BS."
ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,Hisplan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:09 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this is an endeavor I've only begun to think about in the past couple days. I'm terrified of going to grad school for chem (wanted to go for organic) and find that my 4 years of grad research can't get me a stable position. That said, I would be thrilled with a chemE degree that takes me only as far as a typical ChemE bachelor. If I can get accepted to a masters program, I will do my best to make myself marketable like you suggest. If I emailed a few schools, do you think they would be able to give me an idea of if they will even consider me as an applicant with my biochem degree? A few other online sources with this similar question has said they will probably ask me to take some undergrad courses in engineering, but other than that I would be welcomed. Any knowledge on that subject? Thank you guys for all the help so far."
ChemicalEngineering,3dyohc,jonasb24,3,Mon Jul 20 18:21:27 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right. Again your best bet is talking to a professor, they can admit to regardless of whether or not you meet the admission requirements. You'd be surprised how many ChemE faculty are into the BioChem side of things. Then you just have to ask yourself if you can handle the course work without the undergrad knowledge, that's not an easy task.   Have you considered sticking around 2 years at your undergrad institution and getting a second degree in ChemE? That would probably be the cheaper, easier and faster path towards becoming a ChemE."

I'd also say check to see if the honors program in your college is actuall ""made"" for engineering majors. At my college it was really an extra accreditation for humanities majors and to actually do it as an engineering major it required a ridiculous amout of jumping through hoops that resulted in most people having lower GPAs than they would have if they'd never done it. Probably wont make the first semester much worse so go to your major's building/floor/whatever and ask older students and teachers if the Honors thing is actually worth the time."

They won't let you double-major in engineering concurrently either, so it's not just a going back thing. They also will force-graduate you if you are getting a double major in non-engineering but finish your engineering major first (had a friend who almost accidentally finished his engineering major before his physics major and had to drop a class just to make sure they didn't graduate him). I always thought it had something to do with graduation rates. Schools like being able to show that they graduate engineers quickly. But I'm not actually sure. Interested to know why as well. However, a way around your problem is to get a master's in the field that you're interested in. That's how people typically switch fields as far as I know."

ChemicalEngineering,3duvro,Karyuu17,8,Sun Jul 19 18:30:50 2015 UTC,"If you're good enough for people to think of you as a potential plant manager, you probably are. Take the job then figure out how to do it.  Worst case scenario if you find out that you suck at it, jump ship to another company."
ChemicalEngineering,3duvro,17399371,5,Sun Jul 19 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting opportunity to be sure, when you say plant manager you mean of the whole enchilada or one of a few managers of a specific unit or business function at a plant?  How many employees roughly?  25/50/100/250+?  Does the plant run reasonably well, are the employees reasonably competent?  Or is it constant fires... or is the plant one thinned heat exchanger tube that needed to be replaced but didn't fit in the budget away from disaster.  I think in my current life, I couldn't consider any position like this.  I see them as generally short lived, not because they go poorly, but because those kinds of folks tend to do three to four years in a location, and then move within the company.  If I was single, or was married to a woman who did not work, or had kids... and had the skills, I might be talked into it.  However, I'd need managerial experience first... I feel like the jump from project manager to plant manager is too risky.  The jump from lead to plant manager too risky.  Seems like a department manager or superintendent to plant manager is a better (i.e. less risky) jump.  I am curious if it is possible to go ""backwards"" after the plant manager stint or if you are beholden to horizontal moves once you take the first one.  I'm struggling with going back to ""engineer"" status after being a ""lead"" of 10-15 people for ~2 years.  My first stint back as an ""engineer"" starts Monday, and people are already talking about what I'm going to lead next... and I do not want to.  It would seem going backwards is hard.  I can only imagine that taking the plant manager position is a permanent jump to a managerial position or some sort of senior PM kind of role.  /u/wheretogo_whattodo I think hit one of the biggest changes on the head, once you take this position, it is what you do.  You move to wherever you do it next after a few years.  If the plant manager position seems premature at this point for you, watch this transition carefully.  I feel like statistically, there will be another opening in 2-5 years... you could jump in then if you wanted.  When do you have to decide?"
ChemicalEngineering,3duvro,GlorifiedPlumber,2,Mon Jul 20 04:02:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insightful replay. The position is the whole enchilada, probably around 30-50 person plant. There are two plant opening right now. My current plant manager doesn't want to take the position at our new grassroot facility, so it might be a brand new facility, but it could also be my current facility which is fairly dated ~1950s ( he will move to the new facility) but still limping along/flagship facility for the area.  I think I am ready for the management part, as in my previous job that was pretty much the sole objective of the company, to turn the new engineer to the next management (leadership training, lean training, management training, and HR stuff (part of me died after going through the course). Additionally, I have been covering for my plant manager while he is away.   I am still afraid of the leap. I'm currently 26 and already felt the issues dealing with operators that have been at operating the plant for 20+ years. This will also make me the youngest supervisor for the area...  The decision is about a month away."

ChemicalEngineering,3dtqmw,ultrapilpo,5,Mon Jul 20 11:02:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the longer you're out of school and not in an engineering position the less appealing you look as a potential employee. If given the choice between two candidates, one who just graduated and one who graduated 15 months ago I would choose the recent grad. 15 months out of school and I can guarantee that you have forgotten a significant portion of your education.  You need to make sure you are keeping your skills sharp and going out of your way to do things that will continually improve your resume. A couple of examples:  1) Study for and pass the PE exam in October. In most states you can take the exam as soon as you graduate. It's not an easy test, but it is doable. Passing the exam shows you are a competent ChE and obviously haven't forgotten everything you learned in school over the last year.   2) Take a programming course at a community college. Getting a background in programming will make you better at your job. It will also be something else to put on your resume. Most importantly, it will keep your problem solving skills sharp.   3) Get in the best shape you possibly can. Looking healthy is going to give you an advantage in the interview process. Beyond that, get a nice tailored outfit and make sure you are the sharpest looking candidate that walks in for an interview."

ChemicalEngineering,3dqvpt,Manometer,8,Sat Jul 18 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"This works.   I manufacturer catalytic converters, lots of stuff can go wrong during the various processes we use to get our coatings onto the ceramic monoliths.  When I first started at this job the company culture was to blame the operators when that went wrong, but the operators were just following instructions that the previous engineers had written. It became obvious to me that neither the engineers or the operators understood the process or the factors that influenced it.  For example, we would often get catalyst impregnation solution blowing out the back of the parts rather than dosing just enough to cover the parts as designed. Not only did it make the parts look like shit, which customers would reject or complain about, it also wasted a shit ton of Pt and Pd containing solution - very expensive.   Turns out they had the same problem every summer, but nobody knew that, because nobody was tracking the problem. It was humidity, water vapor filling up the pores of the substrate so it couldn't accept as much coating.  Now we lunch and learn sessions once a month to teach each other about the process. Fluid mechanics, trouble shooting, going over the recent problems we've had. Things are getting so much better.  Always include your operators in things like this, they usually know more about the process than engineers - they just don't speak the same language or know the theory behind their observations.  On a side note, more articles like this please, this sub is becoming a little too jobs board like for my tastes.

ChemicalEngineering,3dms9k,CEngineer_AM,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"Is there a significant advantage in job prospects or in general to have the licence?   No. It only helps if a PE license will eventually be required for your job. It is usually only necessary for some consulting positions. Most other companies don't even know what it is. The vast majority of Chem Es are not PEs. Most of us never end up working with a PE for the mentorship required to take the PE exam.   Should I take the exam while I am still in school or should I spend a couple of months studding after I finish school and then take it?   I didn't study at all for it and passed the first time, but I probably couldn't pass it without studying for a long time right now. So...   What do you recommend to successfully pass it on the first try and is it hard?   ...take it as close to graduation as possible so the material is fresh. If you take it soon after cramming for your finals you should be fine.  Edit: It may seem like I am discouraging you from taking it, I am not. All graduating seniors should take a stab at it. It will never be easier to pass as when the material is fresh, it keeps your options open and is decent resume filler very early in your career."
ChemicalEngineering,3dms9k,yellownumberfive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"To add onto this - a lot of states are allowing you to take the PE exam as soon as you finish your BS (you still have to put in the 5 years work experience to actually get your license).   When I took it last year it was a ton of effort to relearn all the basic ChemE stuff 5 years after the fact. I know I could have passed that test with minimal studying just after graduation.   I'd take both tests ASAP. Maybe you get your PE 5 years from now, maybe you don't, but it doesn't hurt to have a passing score under your belt"
ChemicalEngineering,3dms9k,Jokiesamoster,2,Fri Jul 17 22:15:29 2015 UTC,So did they get rid of the mentor requirement?   If so I may look into getting my license.   Does anybody know for how long a passing FE exam is valid?
ChemicalEngineering,3dms9k,yellownumberfive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:32:41 2015 UTC,"I think the requirements vary by state. I'm pretty sure everywhere requires other PE's to sign off on your application, but you don't necessarily have to have worked under one for you work experience to be considered valid."
ChemicalEngineering,3dms9k,Jokiesamoster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:40:52 2015 UTC,"I have a fair number of years of operational and design experience.  I just took the test, did not study and passed.  I expect to do sort of the same for the PE shortly.  I think if you have a solid repertoire varied process design experience it shouldn't be too rough.  I think I would not have done as well, or have been as relaxed taking it, if I'd done it right out of school.  My years of design experience taught me how to look up things quickly and do back-of-the-envelope or in your head calculations.  This is a substantial portion of the test.  I am pursuing my PE now, not because its a requirement (though for some positions and design work it is) but because at this point in my career I view the PE as a commitment and an indication of capability.  5 years into my career I would not have felt worthy of the PE.  More than a decade in I am feeling worthy of the title.  My point is that you can do well though you have been out of university for a while.  I highly recommend taking the first test as a ""practice"" exam.  If you pass, great, if not, you know what to study.  The cost of re-taking the exam is likely much less than the time, effort and dollars in studying for it."
ChemicalEngineering,3dms9k,pr_engineer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:13 2015 UTC,"My worry is that my pure thermodynamic knowledge is in my opinion rather weak.

I feel very good in my separations, kinetics and reactor design and math knowledge.   I want to take them exam but I don't know if I should study thermo and mass transfer after I finish school in order to be more prepare."
ChemicalEngineering,3dms9k,Sealegssteve,2,Fri Jul 17 20:05:39 2015 UTC,"I graduated in May and just took the exam 2 weeks ago. It is not too difficult but you should definitely review everything before hand, with more focus on the things you do not feel comfortable with (in your case mass transfer and thermo). I spent about 2 weeks studying before hand but I had been out of school for a couple months. You could take it while still in school but should still study for it. You should also use an exam review book, I used Chemical Discipline-Specific Review for the FE/EIT Exam,2nd ed. by Richards, Lopina, and Lindeburg.  I'm not sure if it helps getting jobs, I got my job before I got the results back. However, a lot of jobs I applied for had the EIT certification as one of their preferred qualifications, so it can't hurt. If you have any other questions let me know."
ChemicalEngineering,3dms9k,pr_engineer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:27:28 2015 UTC,That's kind of the beauty of this test.  I found that the majority of the questions were quick back of the envelope questions using calculations that I was either already very familiar with or could easily find and use in the reference.  Studying like crazy every subject until you don't feel weak is not good use of time and I don't think that this is the point.
ChemicalEngineering,3dms9k,yellownumberfive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:47:28 2015 UTC,If the test is still multiple choice like it was 15 years ago that really helps as well.

It's also something that cannot be done on-site. You have to uninstall the equipment and send it somewhere - and that is a major pain in the ass and expensive as well.  If it's just a hole in the jacket it can be patched. If the jacket is fouled up with scale or rust you can try running some dilute acid solution through it to clean it up and switch to a better heat exchange fluid with more corrosion inhibitors."

ChemicalEngineering,3dcou9,thekid2009,9,Wed Jul 15 06:08:55 2015 UTC,"Firstly margins have not changed significantly over the past year. With oil coming down sales prices have also fallen. You can monitor something like a 5:3:2 Crack spread to keep track of this. This is calculated by 3price of gasoline +2price of diesel(heating oil) - 5* price of oil. Your prices all need to be calculated in similar terms ($/bbl). ~9$/bbl is breakeven in a refinery and anything above 25 is really good. I haven't checked in a while but my guess is it just around 20. Use Bloomberg.com/energy to get these prices. They mix units so you will need to convert (42 gal/bbl)   Also, many oil companies are vertically Integrated meaning they have business in upstream which means the company as a whole is hurting so it doesn't matter that the refinery is doing well. They need to cut as many costs as possible."
ChemicalEngineering,3dcou9,GoldenTechy,6,Wed Jul 15 11:35:07 2015 UTC,"First off, great answer, a lot of useful information. I did a basic Google search for some more statistics besides the 5:3:2 spread and found: http://www.howardweil.com/docs/Reports/WEEKLY%20REPORTS/REFININGReport.pdf"
ChemicalEngineering,3dcou9,Pyronic_Chaos,3,Wed Jul 15 14:11:08 2015 UTC,"Downstream margins (refining and bulk chemicals) aren't just dependent on oil price, so a high oil price isn't necessarily bad. Think of Downstream as a middle man. Price of the products less the price of feed. The crack spreads others have mentioned are a good way to track this. But another thing to pay attention to is the transience of prices. Oil price often changes rapidly, while fuel prices react more slowly. Downstream makes and loses money because of this.   Another thing to consider is natural gas price, which drives Downstream energy costs, NGL prices, ethane cracking margins, etc."
ChemicalEngineering,3dcou9,BuzzingGator,4,Wed Jul 15 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"Great answers regarding the economics have already been given.

All those upstream oil companies are cutting their workforces and laying off engineers, guess where they are going.  If I can hire an engineer with 3-5 years under their belt for slightly more than somebody fresh out of school the choice is obvious, and there are plenty of mid-career engineers available."

My company (Canada) hires operators at $70K starting and you're at about $80K by end of year one, and $100K by end of year five. Ish. Past that? Inflation + slight market adjustment, but you've hit your ceiling. Maybe you'll be a senior operator, team lead, day supervisor, etc. but in my company that's the highest you can go. You might think you've hit the jackpot in salary now, since operators make similar (slightly lower) than engineers for a few years, but one is capped after that and one isn't.  If I were you? I'd stick with it for a year or two and see if it gets better. Save every penny you can. Apply for university (MIGHT be too late for 2015-2016) just to see if you can get in.

ChemicalEngineering,3d69st,Karyuu17,3,Tue Jul 14 03:19:31 2015 UTC,You could ask that at the Chemistry department at your university.
ChemicalEngineering,3d69st,vingnote,3,Tue Jul 14 04:32:37 2015 UTC,As far as I am aware there is no Polymer Science minor at UMN. I would suggest you take the two undergraduate polymer classes available (one is offered fall only and the other one is offered spring only) then take the polymer lab that is offered. You can also take additional graduate level polymer classes if they are available and you get instructor permission. That should be more than enough to give you a very good background in polymers.

Honestly, a lot of chemical engineering has very little to do with the traditional definition of ""chemistry."""
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,Dynamite_Fools,10,Sun Jul 12 22:56:23 2015 UTC,"Chemical engineering is far better for job opportunity and wages (at least immediately out of your bachelors). But it's also a lot less chemistry than you'd expect.  It seems quite frequently that chemical engineers aren't concerned with the specific reaction, but instead, how they're containing or feeding it. Sure, it's possible to make a gallon of diesel from glucose (chemistry). But how can we make 10,000 gallons as safely and cheaply as possible? How do we transport that 10,000 gallons through a system of pumps, heat exchangers, reactors, and separation units?  They bring up chemistry because there are a lot of considerations that are easier to account for if you have a background in chemistry (heat of reaction, phase changes, chemical kinetics, catalysts, acid/base chemistry, chemical byproducts, and safety concerns associated with particular compounds). But you could probably make it through a number of projects without knowing the specific reaction or pathway. We're essentially mechanical engineers who are more qualified to work with weird liquids."
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,MosDeaf,4,Sun Jul 12 23:49:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks. If were interested in say...designing or ""building"" fuels, it would be better to major in chemistry?"
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,gdt1320,6,Sun Jul 12 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"Depends, if you want to be on the design side working in a research lab developing new types of innovative fuels at a bench to pilot scale. The other side is designing or optimizing large scale processes to develop the bench scale research experiments into something on an industrial or commercial scale.   If you'd rather do the first, chemistry is the best choice. If you'd rather do the second, chemical engineering is a better fit."
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,jetfuel_steeldreams,2,Mon Jul 13 00:45:46 2015 UTC,Wow! Thanks for the response. I like the first option and had it my mind to lean more towards chem.
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,lamarcus,3,Mon Jul 13 00:55:09 2015 UTC,Just know that you need a PhD in order to do that kind of chemistry research and be paid for it. A chemistry BS degree will only let you become a lab assistant with low pay and normally tedious work. Meanwhile you can get a much higher starting salary as a chem engineer BS
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,MosDeaf,2,Mon Jul 13 12:33:39 2015 UTC,"I'd still recommend going ChemE... at the bachelor's level, there are more job opportunities, and you can still get into most of the same Chemistry grad programs if you want that."
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,lamarcus,2,Mon Jul 13 14:08:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're envisioning by ""designing or building fuels,"" as we know fuels, and we're pretty well-versed in how to synthesize pre-existing fuels on a lab scale. But there's a lot of really cool catalyst chemistry coming out, which will open a lot of doors. That's going to require a chemistry major or possibly a materials science degree. Probably a masters on top of that.  That said, for something like fuels, there's still a fair amount of chemical engineering R&D that would also address this. R&D in chemical engineering tends to be a bit more chemistry focused, as you definitely need to know the chemistry if you're going to try scaling it up in a novel way. You're also going to take a pay cut, but hey, if you're interested, definitely go for it.  Lastly, I'd recommend starting with ChemE. If a semester in, you realize you fucking hate the math and the focus is not where you want to be, switch over to chemistry. If only because of the course requirements, it's a easier to go from ChemE to Chemistry than the other direction."

ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,Weltal327,3,Mon Jul 13 00:41:51 2015 UTC,You'll need to get good at (and try to start liking) math to make it through grad school.
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,twoxy,3,Mon Jul 13 14:12:34 2015 UTC,"I would read up some on the history of chemical engineering. It really came out of the need for a go between that wasn't a chemist or a mechanical engineer, but a hybrid of the two.   You mentioned in another comment that you want to design fuels etc.   I have been an engineer in an R&D type facility, and I rarely had input in the chemicals in a process, but I worked closely with chemists to figure out how their bench scale chemistry could be duplicated on the larger scale.   I would say that if you want to do that one thing, you should search far and wide within academia for a professor (chemistry or chem E) that has research opportunities in that field. It may still be hard to find a job doing exactly that. It could take time, but you could also go into academia and do that research yourself if you can get grant requests etc.   You may want to explore further and may find that fuel design is handled by mechanical engineers or aerospace aeronautics engineers etc."

It's slow, takes a lot of forward planning, and may never succeed.   Chemical engineers take that knowledge and then apply it on a far more massive scale. You don't need to know the in depth material, but you do need to know the thousand things that can go wrong on a massive scale.   End note: I love the engineering so much more. If feels far more rewarding and let's you turn advanced concepts into reality."
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,thekid2009,2,Mon Jul 13 12:01:24 2015 UTC,"I am currently a rising senior in Chemical Engineering and just pass the junior year. I can tell you from very recent experience that we deal with very little Chemistry. In the junior year the closest I was to chemistry was naming the compounds in the problem statements. For example 100mol/hr of X mixture of chemicals  are going into a distillation column, how many trays and heat is needed to achieve certain separation.   Transport Phenomena which is like somebody said the physics of ChemEs deals with momentum (think fluids in pipes), heat (Heat exchangers), and Mass transfer (Perfume going into air). Very little chemistry there other than naming a compound X.  I am now taking Kinetics and Reactor Design and this is the most chemistry I have had so far in a ChemE class. We have to derive rate laws of chemical reactions from reaction mechanism and such but be warn because we do all this so we can get to the end goal which is to correctly size a reactor or figure out how much heat we need to add or remove to the process to achieve certain conversion. And then send it to a separation train to further clean our product.   There is no such thing as organic chemistry synthesis , valence electrons and orbitals or specifics like that. And there won't be in my future because what I have left are the senior design classes which is basically to design a chemical plant in a simulator and all the units in it where I am guessing all the reaction info is given to us. Also how to make it make money.  I just said all this so you have opinion of somebody who is taking all this classes at the moment and so you know kind of what you would be getting into. It is very different than chemistry and honestly more challenging and time consuming, at least in the bachelor level. But I love it and I love that there are not massive amounts of pure chemistry stuff, I am not good at that but I am very good at the engineering part."
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,Trex_Lives,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:55:31 2015 UTC,Thank you. It is always nice to hear from someone in the middle of courses. I have been researching and meeting in person with some local chemists and engineers (my dad included: an ME) and I think I will change my major to chemistry. Engineering sounds way too prescribed towards what you will be doing after school...math and design. Not my cup of tea.
ChemicalEngineering,3d281l,madefreshdaily,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:05:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a high school student on track to major in Chemical Engineering, and I might be able to provide a bit of insight into this question as I had to do a bit of research as a result of being questioned a lot about it. From what I can tell, Chem E implements chemistry, but focuses more on the physics of chemical reactions rather than simply the chemical processes themselves. And as well, as others have have said, the purpose is to figure out how to implement the physical changes necessary to synthesize specific chemicals on a bulk scale as opposed to focusing on individual reactions."

You need to understand the physical principles in order to make good decisions about selection and maintenance of equipment, and you need to know how everything fits together so you can financially optimizing the production."

ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,johnh20671,4,Sun Jul 12 21:41:41 2015 UTC,"As an addendum, I can't think of any Ph.D. that you should be paying for.  At minimum you should have tuition covered."

ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,ChEChicago,5,Sun Jul 12 22:44:04 2015 UTC,"Like johnh said, you should definitely not by paying for a PhD in chemical engineering. PhD programs will generally give you a stipend on top of covering your tuition. The stipend is usually enough to cover housing and cost of living. Therefore, if your parents are willing to help pay for your undergrad, then UT seems to be the better option, especially since you like it more. There will also be many more scholarship opportunities while you're in undergrad.  Also, even if you can graduate in 3 years, it might not be the best option. You should definitely consider applying for internships or paid research positions, which will probably delay your graduation, but can be very helpful in terms of finances. Also, they are crucial when applying to graduate school. Someone who graduated in 3 years with a 4.0 but no research experience is going to be worse off than someone who graduates in 4 years with <4.0 and more experience."
ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,zero_factorial,3,Sun Jul 12 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"UT Austin.   I'm a strong believer in the idea that ""you're an average of the people you spend the most time with"".... social pressure is no joke.   I don't know much about either school, apart from UTA's stellar reputation. I assume that means there are consistently top notch research professors and extremely hard working and ambitious students. As long as you have adequate aptitude to keep up, I think it would be a major positive influence. I assume LA Tech is much more average - less impactful research, and lazier/lower achieving students (especially in their life outside of class). At my average state school, ChemE students might be smart and hardworking enough to get good grades, but many were shockingly naive or lacking wrt life skills. If you think your drive to succeed is truly independent of the people around you, then LA Tech is the right choice. But I think most people have a tendency to conform to average performance when it comes to stuff they ""have to do"".   I also believe in the abundance mindset - assure yourself that you will be a successful engineer and that $60k is okay to let go for better opportunities. You will make much more than that throughout your life. It's true that $60k can compound to $600k+ at retirement, but so can the better opportunities, skills, and connections you might develop at a better school. These are the things that will make your make your career fulfilling."
ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,lamarcus,2,Mon Jul 13 14:01:55 2015 UTC,"I've worked with some great and some terrible LA Tech engineers. I've worked with some great and some terrible engineers where I really don't think the school mattered.   I think the quarter system at LA Tech is a big negative for being on the same schedule as your friends back home, but I'm not sure if it affects CO-OP schedules or not.   You mentioned PHD. It's usually considered academic suicide to get your PHD at the same school you do undergrad FYI. Also, I wouldn't plan on a PHD until you get into a program, do some research, and know that it's for you. I thought about a PHD once, but I really only wanted it because I admired some of my professors that much. Also, UT is a pretty expensive place to jump right into chemical engineering which is a degree that many people (even the really smart ones) don't always succeed at.   All that being said, I had a free ride coming out of high school to a school that had a good chemical engineering program, and I picked what I think is a better program, but I picked it for all of the other reasons I loved the college. I picked it for the other 150 hours a week when I wasn't in class. I met my best friends there, I met my wife there, and I found out who I was there. And it's not because it was the right place for me any more than the other school with the free ride was the right place. It's where I chose to go.   I've always hated the Robert Frost poem the road not taken, because I feel like it implies you have to take the road less travelled. I think that you really just have to pick a road and know it won't always be easy, but that it'll be your road because you chose it.  Last long-winded thing. You mentioned you can get through in 3 years etc. Please try to enjoy college. You have to be a grown-up after that. Burnout is a very real thing. I tell most people to treat college like a job. Spend 40 hours a week focused on school. Get up at the same time everyday, go to class (like its a meeting on your work calendar), and then take the things you got from your class (your action items from your meeting) and work on them until quitting time or your next class (meeting). If you have a bigger project and a deadline then work late. The important part, is if you can, when you've finished with your 8 hours for the day, go out and enjoy college life."

Or the assumption is that you don't like to leave your comfort zone you have established in undergrad.  Either of those might be true or might be utter crap, but it is what it is. The stigma is DEFINITELY real.  Exceptions to this rule might be if you got your undergrad at an already VERY prestigious school (MIT, Carnegie Melon, etc) but even then you would be considered lower than someone that went to multiple schools.  It's also a good idea to go to multiple schools so you think about things differently.  Also, go to LA Tech. Your parents are amazing to pay that for you to go to school, especially when a different school is giving you an almost free ride. Take the free ride. You have no idea how things will go for you in school and where you will be 6 months from now, much less 4 years from now. Myself and plenty of my friends were all planning on the PhD route when we started ChemE. . . only ~4 of the starting 20 or so have actually followed through on that.  Not saying you will wimp out and not want to put in the work. . . nothing of the sort. Just that preferences change, especially when you first go off to school and get away from what is familiar. You WILL change. LA Tech might be a mistake. .  UT might be a mistake, you have no way of knowing. But saving $60k is a good thing for certain.   And I hate to be the Debbie Downer, but there is always that chance that your parents pay for that first year, and then something happens and they can't do the rest. Then you are kinda screwed. (not really, student loans are completely doable, just make life more difficult starting out with that much debt)  Just my 2 cents worth. Take it or leave it. Good luck."

ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,musicnerd1023,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:20:47 2015 UTC,Maybe I should have just made a TL;DR for my long post.  TL;DR: Academics care about what school(s) you went to. Engineers working in industry (except maybe higher end R&D) don't care where you went.
ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,musicnerd1023,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:35:34 2015 UTC,"In my experience no one gives a flying fuck what school you went to for undergrad. Using that school for networking opportunities is valid if they are a higher ranked school though. (Can't argue against any networking opportunities)  But as for thinking it's prestigious. . . No one cares unless they themselves went there. So, you might as well go to a decent school for free before paying a lot of extra money for something that may or may not ever benefit you. It's the wonders of ABET accreditation in the USA, so long as a school is accredited everything else is purely subjective to whoever might care. And most good engineers don't give a shit what you did for undergrad since 99% of undergrad utterly DOES NOT MATTER in the real world.  OP can take it or leave it with my advice, just putting it out there."
ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,lamarcus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:27 2015 UTC,You sound like someone who thinks grades don't matter because no one asks after your first job.   My point is that both school and grades matter a lot because they have a large impact on where you start out in your career... and your career trajectory is heavily impacted by where you start out. And there are plenty of not-totally-rational people who will assume positively about you just because you went to a top school. Especially if you make any sort of career changes away from pure skills-driven ChemE.
ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,musicnerd1023,0,Wed Jul 15 22:07:43 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go that far. But after you have ~3 years experience what you did in school literally DOES NOT MATTER.
ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,lamarcus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm arguing that it does matter because your position after three years is a function of your your starting point, and your ability to perform well on the job (which is also a function of how well you prepared yourself during school). And also the connections you've established, which are dependent on you showing people you perform well (either in school or on the job)."
ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,musicnerd1023,0,Wed Jul 15 22:16:49 2015 UTC,For some people that might be the truth. For others they do much better in the real world than they ever did in school.  I know plenty of people that killed it in school that are still struggling to figure out the real world and also have friends that are thoroughly in the opposite category.   Just think about this. . . if your theory that performance in school correlates directly with abilities in the real world then the smartest people on earth would be the most wealthy and powerful. . . guess what?

ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,lamarcus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:20:45 2015 UTC,"It's not binary. Academic performance isn't perfectly correlated with work performance, and it's not the only indicator. But GPA (in a difficult degree like ChemE) is still one of the best metrics to look at for measuring determination and aptitude... Both of which can be important in the workplace.  You're also assuming that everyone is primarily motivated by money and power. That is not true for many people... I'd say there's almost an inverse correlation with greed when looking at the highest aptitude people. They seem to be more motivated by ideas and curiosity."

UT is a historic University, it's a super nice campus, with a very well respected Engineering program. The only reason you should pick LA Tech over UT is if you can't afford UT, or if you don't want to move away from home, but if your parents are willing to pay and you're willing to move then to me it's not even a question - UT."

If I were you I would choose UT-Austin.  It's one of the best programs in the country, you really like the city/school, and your parents are willing to pay for it.  You can't really go wrong there.    I do want to add a bit about getting a PhD.  Make sure you find out pretty quickly if getting a PhD is what you want to do.  Get involved in research as early as possible.  I considered UT-Austin for grad school, and from what I saw during my visit, a good bit of the professors will get undergrads to help out in their lab, so you should have plenty of opportunity to get involved.  You can look up the faculty's research interests on the department's website and figure out which ones sound interesting in you.  You can e-mail them or visit them in their office and ask them if they are looking to fill undergraduate positions.  You could even tell them that you have a lot of electives out of the way, so you could use some of that extra time to do research.    If you do go to UT-Austin, they actually won't let you apply to their graduate program.  A lot of top programs actually do this because it's better to broaden your research experience at another institution.  Going somewhere else isn't a bad thing because there are a lot of top-tier programs that you could attend if you still want to get a PhD.  And like others said, you will get paid for a Chemical Engineering PhD, and the stipends are generally much higher than what you would get in other programs.  Finances won't be a huge issue in grad school.    Good luck on your decision!"
ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,friedchicken123,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"Background: I just graduated from UT's ChemE program this May. Here is my take.  I don't know (or heard) of anyone who did both BS and PhD from UT Austin and many I spoke too said that it is out of the ordinary for ChemE. It seems you almost never get your ChemE PhD from the same school you did you BS  I also think 3 years is gonna be EXTREMELY difficult (and very tough on your GPA) unless you also take summer classes. It's good that you have a lot of incoming credit. I had a lot and did my degree in 3.5 years (no summer classes, co-oped instead) and there were definitely several semesters of hell. If I had to balance research on top of those semesters (like you will have to), I don't know if I could have done it.  The students at UT ChemE are also ALL TOP-NOTCH and most graduated in the top 2-3% of their high schools. If you want to get your PhD funded at a good program, you are going to want to stand out and also have a high undergrad GPA. There are certain courses and certain professors that, if you plan your degree right, you can graduate having learned much less, but with much better grades (grumble grumble), and have a way less-shitty social life. My favorite part about UT ChemE was actually the life-long friends/connections I made - it's really small and tight knit and is an everybody-knows-everybody community. The hard classes encourage us to spend a lot of time with each other.  Another thing is to consider your research interests and goals. Higher ranked schools like UT Austin tend to do a lot of the fancy, high-tech & ""hot"" CHE research (Bio/genetic engineering & high-level material science like nanotechnology, semiconductors, batteries, etc). This is very far from ""traditional"" chemical engineering like what 90% of graduates would get a job for (process design, process control/optimization, simulations, catalysts), which UT specialized in 30-40 years ago when this was ""hot."" I know of only 3 professors who do this research (1 in separations, 1 in CO2 capture, 1 in process control)  Anyways, I really miss college. Feel free to ask me any questions!

It is virtually impossible to get your BS/PHD from here as a ChE.  You will have been trained by a top notch professor here, who can only teach you so much.  They also want to show off how good they have molded you to your supervisor at your post-grad university (which is how rankings are determined, in all honesty).   Don't rush through things. I went in planning to graduate in 3 years so I could be near family at the end, lot of stuff going on at home, but opted out of it because my GPA suffered and it wasn't fair to put that much pressure on myself.

ChemicalEngineering,3d1y07,Thelonius_Dunk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:57:19 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll be the odd one out and say La Tech.  When I graduated from HS I was accepted into Vanderbilt (with no $$) and Ole Miss (full ride).  I too had planned on going the PhD route after a ChemE undergrad (biomedical engr phd instead of chem engr phd though).   I went to Ole Miss, even though Vanderbilt was the more prestigious program.  It was a hard decision to make, but I figured I could always apply to a prestigious grad school.  I ended up not going to grad school anyway b/c:   (1) - I didnt apply to enough schools (I did 3) and didnt get in, and...  (2) - $$$-Got hired for pretty decent job anyway after I didnt get in and decided I'll put off grad school for much later.  I'd advise you to take the 4 full yrs at La Tech too.  That'll give you time to apply to summer or full-yr research programs during college if you don't want to do research at La Tech.  You'll need alot of research experience to apply to grad school, and it'll look good if you've worked at multiple schools.  While at La Tech, just bust your ass and stand out (High GPA + Extensive Research Experience + High GRE) as an excellent candidate when you're ready to apply to grad school. You could probably even get into UT-Austin for grad school anyway if things work out....that way, you got a free undergrad education and you won't be in debt for the 4-6 yrs youre working on your PhD (which you won't be making much $$$)....Or if you don't get into grad school or decide you dont want to do it, you're still not in debt yrs later."

Your resume design- you have no clue how sloppy and unorganized some engineers are. If I get information from you I want to be able to grab the information I need right away, and not have to spend time doing work that you should have done. I just recently had a coworker give me an excel sheet full of so many ""if"" statements it would take me a day to figure out what the entire thing was doing. I was tempted to just throw the excel sheet out and do it myself, grrrrr that was so annoying. Anyways sorry for ranting... Based on their resume they've accomplished a lot in their time span- I look at this one the most because past track history is a relatively good way to figure out how they will do in the future.   I had a couple that I messaged in the past few months.  Unfortunately they were looking for specific things (location mainly) that I didn't know of any open spots. I admit I am pretty picky on helping people find jobs and stuff. I've been in the same spot when I was graduating college, but if they look bad then I will look bad.

ChemicalEngineering,3cxtzv,mushimushy,3,Sat Jul 11 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"R&D requires experience. A BS really doesn't give you the level of knowledge you need to contribute original ideas to a field.   A PhD will immediately put you in the R&D world, and pave your way to keep that sort of position in the future. That being said, graduate programs are very difficult. You're expected to take classes, do 30-40 hours of research a week, write and publish papers, give presentations etc, etc, etc... All for 15$ an hour if you're lucky, and no raises for the next 5 years. If you're thinking an MS, make sure it is a thesis track degree and you are taking upper level classes in he field you want to to R&D in. Taking an upper level heat transfer course is not going to be as valuable as say a course that focuses on biomass conversion(if that is what you want to go into).  You can get the experience in industry, but it is still going to take 4-6 years, and you need to make an effort getting the right type of experience. Doing paperwork for an ISO certification is not going to make you an ideal candidate for developing a super efficient catalyst, for example.    In terms of what to learn, a DOE class would be really useful, a data analysis class would also be good. If you're going to learn a programming language forget LabView, go with python. Python is much much better for data analysis (which is what you will be doing) and has the ability to branch into data acquisition as well. Six Sigma is more for the large-scale production guys, but it won't hurt."
ChemicalEngineering,3cxtzv,Jokiesamoster,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. I realize a BS is definitely underqualified for original research, but I thought I did see a thread a while back of people working in R&D with a BS (not in a lead role though). I'm not sure I would be ready for a PhD commitment... an MS with thesis sounds a bit better for me, but it doesn't seem like it would be something that you'd be able to do while working. Right now I want to build work experience and need to pay off loans, so I have some things to think about. I definitely do want to focus my experience towards applicable fields.  Also yeah, a DOE/data analysis background is what I thought would be good to acquire. Are there any good books that are recommended in the area or is it exclusively the domain of grad classes? I've dabbled in Python and like that idea."
ChemicalEngineering,3cxtzv,odh_moyer,2,Sun Jul 12 00:27:39 2015 UTC,buy a raspberry pi 2 with some add ons to start making your own controls and data acquisition. It is what I use for all of my experiments.

I would recommend taking a class at a Community College or something to get a solid OOP background and if you can find a graduate level DOE class take that too. The DOE class I took had everyone develop an experiment based on their research/professional work, they basically taught us all how to do our jobs more efficiently."

I've heard from a presentation that the company Bristol Myers Squibb has such a program, though a rigorous one. I am ready to make full commitment for a PhD, but I would much rather get funding from a company AND work for them while pursuing the Phd, rather than get funding from a university that results in the workload you mentioned for $15.   Point being, how common/rare is such a program for big companies?"
ChemicalEngineering,3cxtzv,Jokiesamoster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"The stuff I have come across are corporate sponsored fellowships. If your research coincides with the interest of a large company, they'll throw some funding your way. These are extremely competitive, and you usually have to already be enrolled in a program and have produced some pretty impressive results. Even so, they are funding the research, so while you won't have a problem buying equipment or producing samples, you are still only getting 30-40k a year.   There is a silver lining, if you find a professor who is willing to let you have the summers off, you can take internships. I get paid 40-45$/hr during the summer working which helps even things out cashflow wise."
ChemicalEngineering,3cxtzv,Maestintaolius,3,Mon Jul 13 00:19:36 2015 UTC,"With the recession there's been a lot of credential inflation since quite a few people decided to stay in school and weather out the poor job market or after they lost their job got an advanced degree.  10 years ago it was reasonably easy to substitute an advanced degree with experience but now it's really difficult. My company doesn't even look at bachelor's for R&D positions since you can so easily get someone with a PhD. Bachelor's degree applicants generally become lab techs or associates and eventually move on to process positions in my company, but never to R&D (but pre-recession that used to happen all the time).  So TL;DR version, if you want to have R&D options, I strongly recommend finishing your advanced degree."
ChemicalEngineering,3cxtzv,BuzzingGator,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:23:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry, its not what you want to hear, but having a PhD gives you a real advantage for r&d jobs. Could you find the right company and make it work, sure. But if you're looking at giving yourself the best chance for success for a career in r&d, you've got to do what your competition does. Most of the O&G industry doesn't consider non-PhDs anymore. Maybe the other industries are less restrictive.   But you also have to think about advancing in your career after you get a job in r&d. PhDs will have the advantage there, especially if there are PhDs in management. This is an ugly thing to say, but its usually true: PhDs look down on MS and BS degrees in r&d. They don't feel that MS and BS have been properly trained to do research, and no amount of experience will change that. Do you really want to fight that mindset your entire career?"

I find those pretty useful.  We then have a more detailed one every year that goes into factoring in annual raises.

ChemicalEngineering,3cu577,santereality,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:49:43 2015 UTC,Doing all this as a chemical engineer? Looks a bit different than what we learn about control in university
ChemicalEngineering,3cu577,curious95,2,Sat Jul 11 10:32:47 2015 UTC,"That's my point. I'm a chemical engineer by education, and working as a controls engineer, and that's what I spend my time on. I wish it weren't so, but there just aren't 45hrs/week worth of process control do. Optimizing a pid loop gets done quickly by a software package, then you're stuck doing more mundane stuff. And when I say configuring the technical stuff, it's not that complicated... just choosing settings within the software package."
ChemicalEngineering,3cu577,Frawstshock,2,Sat Jul 11 17:07:00 2015 UTC,that is quite a vague description. When you say optimize it sounds like tuning control loops. It might also be creating HMI graphics. Have you taken a controls class/ do you have any understanding of basic control theory? Otherwise loop tuning is going to be quite difficult.

I work for a large company, but my particular site was purchased about 5 years ago. as a result, almost all projects are closing safety gaps and hardware/network upgrades. management is aware that the purpose of the automation group is to implement control projects that improve fundamental control, efficiency, etc., and we should eventually move in that direction.  I think it's reasonable to discuss that with your leader. I will say two things:   the devil is in the details. even on cool projects, 80% of your time will probably end up being config, network considerations, and paperwork I've found that at large companies, if you're interested in doing something, you just have to take the initiative. while you're tackling these daily upkeep problems, be learning the process and chemistry. talk to operators about where growth opportunities are. what controls do they have to 'fight'? what accessible data would make their jobs easier? if you scope it early enough, it can be very easy to slip into another upkeep project.   good luck"
ChemicalEngineering,3cqp77,whte_rbt,5,Fri Jul 10 12:10:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe it is different in operations, but I work in an engineering firm, we have either process engineers or instrument&control engineers. Process defines the control strategy and the preliminary valve sizing. Instruments manage the hardware details, DCS/ESD systems and produce all instrument datasheets  In order to get involved in more process design/control you would need to wait until there is a project to modify part of the plant or add additional equipment. Typically the work will be done by an engineering contractor in various stages, where you would review the documents the contractor produces etc...  No idea if small modifications are handled internally though, that likely depends on the size of the engineering team."

I would be learning a bit about the process and talking to operators about anything they have to control in manual and try to provide a control solution.

Engineers with less than 10 years experience are more or less going to be following the best practices developed by the more experienced engineers and doing very little design and analysis work themselves.   Consider looking at smaller companies (<30 employees). The pay won't be as good, but you'll get to do all the technical work you can handle. You'll also get the the opportunity to use your programming in a more meaningful way since the company won't have a crew of CS guys with more experience to tackle any challenges.   I'd also consider some of the ""up and coming"" cities rather than the established (and expensive) ones you listed. Houston, Phoenix, and Portland are all heavily investing in tech infrastructure, have a ton of small to mid-sized companies looking for solid engineered, and all have top tier research universities."
ChemicalEngineering,3cq4yl,Jokiesamoster,3,Thu Jul 9 22:42:22 2015 UTC,"Wrong about Portland. Definitely not top tier research universities, and the job market here is very saturated for entry-level ChemE."
ChemicalEngineering,3cq4yl,elamo,2,Fri Jul 10 21:08:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up... Kinda unfortunate because that was one of the cities I was excited about. I don't suppose there are any other good options in the Northwest?
ChemicalEngineering,3cq4yl,elamo,2,Sat Jul 11 00:19:46 2015 UTC,"My impression is that Seattle has less opportunity than Portland for ChemE (but I don't have much experience or knowledge about the area). I have heard of a few oil refineries around Washington, though.   Portland has Intel, which hires plenty of ChemE, but usually more at the Masters/PhD/experienced level. Otherwise, though, they'll be happy to hire you on as a technician (not sure how technical that gets). I know of only one girl from Oregon State who got a ChemE position with Intel out of undergrad (she was an outstanding student with at least two relevant internships).   There are lots of other employers in the semiconductor business that might hire you, but you'll need relevant experience or an otherwise excellent resume to stand out from the crowd. This site shows a bunch of companies worth checking out in Portland and the West coast: http://www.siliconmaps.com/silicon_forest.html  Otherwise there's paper mills (not as competitive, but seemingly not especially desirable), Genentech (very competitive), CH2M Hill (competitive), Nike (very competitive), and a grab bag of other smaller companies.   There are definitely manufacturing companies you could go after in other parts of Oregon, and these are probably less competitive."
ChemicalEngineering,3cq4yl,Jokiesamoster,2,Sat Jul 11 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's exactly the sort of long-sighted look I wanted. I think I will definitely take your advice on the alternative cities you mentioned.  Along the same vein, although going to a smaller company would fulfill my more important goals of being financially secure and developing myself technically, does that put me in a bad place long-term? While I'm building the 10+ years of experience that you mentioned I'm fine having a lower pay but I do think eventually I'll probably want to look for a well-paying, stable job. I guess I just worry that this might make things harder for myself in the long term? I'm just basing this off of conventional wisdom and the interviews I participate in on at my company, where we place a lot more weight on candidates from other large companies compared to smaller, local ones."
ChemicalEngineering,3cq4yl,curious95,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:46:14 2015 UTC,"You make some fair points, I guess it depends on what you think you are honestly capable of accomplishing. Whatever your industry, experience is king. You'll get more hands on experience at small companies, but less technical guidance. It's going to be up to you to figure out the theory, and you may or may not have a superior who can explain it to you. That being said, if you put in the hours and learn the material, you will have no problem selling yourself to a big R&D unit when the time comes.   In terms of Portland, there have been 7 people in my lab that have gotten jobs there in the last 2 months. If you are interested in Semiconductors they have Intel, Microchip, Maxim Integrated and 100s of small companies that support their operations. Cost of living is very affordable, plus it's just a fun place to be!"
ChemicalEngineering,3cq4yl,curious95,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:08:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, I just need to sit down and think about whether I'm willing to put in the time/effort for that compared to just trying for a process control job and whether that's the course I want to take.  And I'm actually pretty enthusiastic about Portland myself (visited once for a friend at Intel), but is there really a good computer science program there? A few internet searches don't really show that."
ChemicalEngineering,3cmb48,KillAllCisBlueMen,13,Thu Jul 9 00:44:07 2015 UTC,"What part of the process are you unclear about? C&R is a good guide, but most companies have a pretty set out way of doing things - flow sheets, process design criteria, mass and energy balance, basis of design, supporting calculations, P&IDs, control philosophy and then all of the equipment specs and data sheets etc. This is roughly the sequence, although there is a bit of parallel processing. Ask your boss/project lead for a work flow if they have one, or to show you the project schedule. The latter will give you an idea of the expected sequence.   Does and don'ts - do use the company reference programs, and file EVERY SINGLE calculation you do. Get a brown box and keep it under your desk, if you do a rough calc, concept drawing or estimate, drop the paper in there, keep it until at least three months after the project is done. Follow doc control procedure, save all your emails in the company filing system. Make sure when you are told to do something that you know how, what and when. Ask if you don't know, write all your calculations in such a way that they can be checked, and then get them checked. Don'ts - don't get upset if you make mistakes, it is not a mistake until it is built. Don't ever hide it if you find a mistake, if you find a mistake in someone else's work don't publicise it - ask them to explain it to you because you don't get the same answer/understand what they did. Never bag the client or the vendors, but do remain professional at all times - these people are not your friends, and doing favours or passing on information can and will get you into trouble.  Most of all - learn! Ask questions, clarify and never assume you know what is going on. Do things in other disciplines if you get the chance - this makes you a better manager later. And always - have fun! You might be stressed and under pressure, but this will pass, and when you are on the next project this one will be remembered fondly."

I'm currently the only chemical engineer there, and I've been tasked with designing an entire process at the pilot scale. I'm quite excited for it tbh. I'll be pretty much leading the design stage which is a golden opportunity for a new graduate and I want to make the most of this experience and learn as much as I can.  The only thing is that since I'm the only ChemE there atm, I don't really have anyone to learn from. There is no company guidelines either so I'm pretty much on my own. I've been trying to learn as much as I can about process design procedures and practices used in industry so that I can really do a good job at it.   I'm not worried about the technical design yet (I'll get to that when the time comes) but rather about going in with the right work ethic and habits. The things that you touched on in your second paragraph were what I was looking for. This will be a challenge, but I'm looking forward to it."
ChemicalEngineering,3cmb48,Rossay,8,Mon Jul 13 09:21:15 2015 UTC,"Depending on the size of company you work for, they might have their own internal design guides for you to use as a starting point. Alternatively, Coulson and Richardson's Chemical Engineering vol 6. is generally the ""go to"" textbook for design."
ChemicalEngineering,3cmb48,voynaimir,2,Thu Jul 9 08:40:01 2015 UTC,"There are some books, such as Turton's but I don't think that you can learn process design from them. Sure, read them, but just because you won't lose anything from reading them. Process design requires creativity and insight which are acquired by deeply understanding unit operations and by being exposed to hundreds of different processes. Pick a copy of any process encyclopedia and try to explain everything that's going on and why things have been designed that way. In my opinion, that's the best and most natural way."
ChemicalEngineering,3cl835,hiitsmelenny,13,Wed Jul 8 19:51:16 2015 UTC,"Be cool.  I'm serious. There's little chance that someone is going to try to help you get a job because they met you once at an event. Why would they? They don't really know anything about you. However, you might be able to make a few friends who, after seeing what kind of person you are, over a period of time, would be willing to help you out.  This is why networking is critical while you're still in school. It's an opportunity to form actual relationships."
ChemicalEngineering,3cl835,at_work_alt,3,Wed Jul 8 21:00:10 2015 UTC,Check out Alaina Levine's videos on networking. I've met her in person and been to one of her presentations on networking and she does a great job. You can find her presentations on YouTube and LinkedIn.

ChemicalEngineering,3cl835,Kev-bot,3,Thu Jul 9 13:29:18 2015 UTC,"A bit late, but have your elevator pitch ready. 30 seconds to tell someone your background, education, co-ops, projects, specialty, what field you want to go into. Practice this pitch until you can rhyme it off without hesitation."
ChemicalEngineering,3cl835,hairystockings,4,Fri Jul 10 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"Do you have a card? If not, grab some cardstock and either print some if you can you carefully write a few. Are you on linked in? Now is the time to make a profile. Including your linkedin page on your card is a good idea too. Just making new relationships is the start. Then creating further conversations that eventually lead to someone helping you get a job comes later."
ChemicalEngineering,3cl835,Weltal327,3,Wed Jul 8 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"People will ask you where you work, say that you are looking. Briefly describe who you are in a sentence.   ""Well, I'm actually looking right now, I just graduated in May from university of school. I hope someone here is looking to hire, but really just hoping to make some connections in the profession""  Most importantly, I would just spend time asking questions and learning more about people. Interjecting if you had a project in school that was similar. Asking questions to dive deeper if you're really interested. You can even ask people how they got their positions and even ask for tips, but establish a report first."
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,Inferno221,17,Wed Jul 8 06:01:13 2015 UTC,How do so many people have a better major GPA than cumulative? My ChemE classes were doubtlessly harder than my non-major courses.
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,HiHoJufro,2,Wed Jul 8 13:25:30 2015 UTC,Because gen chem and o chem destroyed me. I thought my ChemE classes were harder conceptually but not as much work.
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,Quesonoche,2,Wed Jul 8 15:44:28 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't those be put in your major gpa, I thought major gpa only excluded gen eds and electives"
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,RedditDestroysDreams,3,Wed Jul 8 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"Nah, my major gpa was only courses with chem E titles"
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,Quesonoche,2,Wed Jul 8 17:15:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could have done better in environmental communications or general psychology but I was only taking them to fill grad requirements, and my interest in them quickly waned.  Plus, more time spent writing those papers meant less time working on core coursework.  The real answer, however, is that I went to a huge school.  My non-major (gen ed) courses were giant 400-person lectures, and it's damn near impossible to get any time with a professor to ask questions, I had to sit on the floor in the back and couldn't see the powerpoint, the room was too noisy to hear the lecture, etc.  The major courses of 40-person classes were more conducive to learning.  The other thing about the gen ed courses is that engineers are put in with ~60% premed students.  Premed students care about their grade more than anything else.  They are the nubbers who harass the TA after every assignment for ""will you shut up if i give you these"" points, cheat if/when necessary, use ethnic cliques to get unavailable course material from other sections and previous years, and have the luxury of time to spend on, say, orgo because it's one of only two real courses they took that semester.  Whereas the engineers are simultaneously taking physics, orgo, calc, thermo, and transport phenom.  Anyway... my major gpa is a 3.1 and my overall is 2.8.  I have them both on my resume now (GPA-2.8 / MGPA-3.1).  Intersted in what people have to say about it."
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,Tiborik,2,Wed Jul 8 15:00:24 2015 UTC,"My situation was very similar to yours. Large school, did bad in non major courses. Yadda yadda yadda.   If the position doesn't explicitly say cumulative GPA, list your major GPA. This is more flattering to you. If they ask why, say something to the effect of ""I believe it more accurately represents my skill set.""  Don't be dishonest, but don't give out more information than you need to."

ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,thekid2009,0,Wed Jul 8 14:18:12 2015 UTC,Lol. I got an A in my unit ops class because my group worked really well together. I got a D in English class because my teacher was sexist and disliked all the engineering students because none of them gave a shit about humanities classes(can't blame them). It happens.

ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,Putnam14,2,Wed Jul 8 23:28:24 2015 UTC,"I guess a lot has changed in 10 years then, because putting GPA on your resume was only something people with 4.0s did for dick-wagging purposes when I graduated."

In his experience C students do C work, paying a little bit more for that A/B work can make all the difference in the world. But then again, some companies will take whatever candidates they can get their hands on. If you want a good work environment and community you should strive for higher grades."
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,Putnam14,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:13:25 2015 UTC,What would your dad say about someone who returned to school last January and has a 3.33 from last 3 semesters but 2.81 overall? Just curious.
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,mhanders,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:54:22 2015 UTC,"3.33 for the last three semesters taking upper level engineering classes? I can ask him tomorrow, but I can take a guess that if you have a well-written cover letter explaining your return to school and what made you change from getting a 2.8 to a 3.3 you would have a decent chance at landing an interview. Different hiring managers look for different things though, as we all know."
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,Putnam14,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:47:18 2015 UTC,Sorry for lack of clarity. My cumulative for the last three semesters plus my precious schoolwork is 2.81.  My last three semesters were drastically better semesters when I returned to school as I knew what I wanted so I got mostly As and Bs. Thus 3.33 for last 3 sem.
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,mhanders,2,Sun Jul 12 08:03:52 2015 UTC,Unless you have a bad GPA I would strongly recommend that you put your GPA on your resume. 9/10 people will see the absence of a GPA as an immediate red flag...
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,NYRican,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:40:01 2015 UTC,My major GPA is considerably better than my cumulative... so I list my major GPA.
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,NYRican,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:40:30 2015 UTC,I would list only my major gpa in your scenario but make sure that it says major gpa and not just gpa.
ChemicalEngineering,3ciroh,cbmb,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"My school doesn't have major GPA but it does have cumulative GPA (CGPA we called it here). I did put my CGPA on my resume because it is the cumulative GPA from my first year until final year. While my GPA is a GPA for every semester from 1st to final year. It's different every semester thus, not really relevant to put it on the resume.   To answer your question, you may list it both or just the higher one (some recruiters put 3.0 & abv as a cutpoint, so whenever they screen the resumes, they only select the 3.0 & abv -- less resume to look at). If the position doesn't say anything about GPA, then you are not obligated to do so. However, if your GPA is 3.0& abv, it is better to put it."

TX/LA area is good for oil and gas and its derivatives, as well as natural gas and the products you make from that.   I have heard about a recent slowdown in Houston area, but not sure if I believe it yet.   The problem is, people have been hiring like crazy the last two graduation periods, so you may be a little too late, and may have to wait until August or December to get any nibbles. But don't give up looking. In addition to ""its all about who you know,"" if you don't know anyone, its all about being in the right place at the right time.   OP asked specifically for regions, so that's what I posted. If you're looking for specific companies that are hiring, I can't give you that info.   Be persistent. Give your resume to head hunters. Get on LinkedIn. Look for local job posting websites. Look for articles about plants doing major expansions or building new facilities.   Get out there man. 9 times out of 10, a job is not going to fall in your lap. Don't get discouraged. Don't turn down a good job cause ""that's not what I want to do."" A job is a job, and as long as it's in the field, it's good experience, it will get you some contacts, and most importantly will get you some good experience on your resume."
ChemicalEngineering,3chuc1,Dynamite_Fools,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:35:19 2015 UTC,"From Houston and can agree with this. Companies hired like crazy last year and the year before so entry level positions have been rough to find in this area unless you went to school here, in which case, the companies come to you. Edit: The upstream business is what really drove employment in this area and those jobs went away with the recent bust so you add that to the fact that companies ramped up their entry level hiring and it makes it a tough market right now."

In fact, even though the cost of living is the same from Buffalo to Houston, I get paid 20% more here.  edit:  A quick search on General Mills' website returns one engineering position in Buffalo, for 5-10 years experience.  Dunlop returns no jobs in engineering.  Maybe the positions you hear about are word of mouth only, which wouldn't really be helpful for a new engineer."

ChemicalEngineering,3cg6dx,craag,2,Tue Jul 7 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"that act like working in a refinery somehow makes them somehow better/smarter than people that work in a chemical plant.   There is a little truth to this, since a company will generally put its best and brightest on units that have highest throughput. There's also a little childish pride that comes from working on large, high-dollar areas.  Having said that, there are a lot of unique opportunities working on smaller products. You can work on a larger number of different projects, you will cover more aspects of the process, and there is more room for improvement. Your manager is going to be much more willing to let you tweak a process. So while your starting pay may be lower, the experience you get could be better and put you in a better position for advancement. There's also something to be said for being a big fish in a little pond. It's a lot easier to stand out in a smaller group."
ChemicalEngineering,3cg6dx,at_work_alt,2,Wed Jul 8 12:57:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, it also seems more cohesive than my current site, everyone worked together at the chem plant, here it's a lot more disjointed.

Also refinery engineers seem to be much busier to the point of being overworked. My employer pushes work/life balance but it seems to be a bit lost on the people here."
ChemicalEngineering,3cc2w3,txcheme,6,Mon Jul 6 19:19:06 2015 UTC,"I asked my HR manager wife.  She said absolutely send a message on LinkedIn.  It's definitely a success multiplier.  Message them and say you are contacting them directly as well as applying through their website because you are extremely interested in the position.  Research their company, what they do, who they do it with, and apply your skills and interests to that.  ""I see that your company does X, an area in which I'm extremely interested for reasons Y and Z"", and so on.  Show them how you'd be a great fit both for their job, and for their company.  Since you are making direct contact, it doesn't hurt to make a personal connection, talking about how it'd be a dream job, since it's exactly what you're looking for, (go into specifics), and is so very close to your home.    She said it also wouldn't hurt to find and contact the ""hiring manager"".  I had to question that one, (the HR manager?), and she finally broke out of HR-speak and said, ""his/her future boss.""  She said the number one thing that ticks her off is when people find her name, but do NO research on the company or position.  #1 is starting off an email to her, (her name is Ashley, and her very feminine picture is on LinkedIn), with ""Dear Sir,""....so don't fuck that up."

What I did was build up my network as big as I could by friending engineers from my University. College kids usually say yes even if they only know you in passing or don't know you at all. Then you can branch out into other people since they'll be connected to you through someone else. You're allowed to message people in your extended network (friends of friends of friends), so this method grows your potential targets quickly.   Being honest is always a plus, but there's no reason to say your GPA right off the bat until they ask. You can also help yourself out by listing your ""upper division"" GPA on resumes and applications, since this only accounts for your last 60 credit hours.   EDIT: Be careful with the friending though. LinkedIn has a cap on the number of people that say ""no"" to your request, and if you hit it they can ban your account. Try to request high-percentage people like recruiters and young engineers."
ChemicalEngineering,3cce4n,LSU_ChE_2016,4,Mon Jul 6 20:35:37 2015 UTC,"First thing is to figure out what they expect from the presentation, usually I've heard of two different types of intern presentations from companies: ones where the exec's want to see results from your projects (a bit more serious), and ones where the exec's want to learn more about your intern experience (more casual) while also conveying what you did over the summer.  Focus on: what did you do for the company, and what did the company do for you? Talk about the projects that you did definitely and the positive implications they had.   However, by far the most important part of the presentation is to set yourself apart, and that starts with your presentation and speaking skills. More important than what you did is how you present what you did, in a way that will speak to the execs greater than just ""intern X did this..."". Make them want to speak with you after your presentation.  This time last year I was starting to think about my presentation for my internship too - it really helps to start early. and don't undermine the importance of it (I don't think you are). For these higher up's, this is the only facetime you'll likely get with them this summer, and they're the people that can really impact you getting rehired or not. I made sure my presentation was one they would remember, and a week later when I had my meetings with them regarding my status for getting a full-time opportunity, they really appreciated not only my PPT but also my demeanor and presentation skills. Good luck!"

ChemicalEngineering,3cce4n,cbmb,3,Wed Jul 8 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"7 minutes isn't a lot of time so you need to streamline. Management doesn't usually care about every detail of everything you did so you should pick two projects that had the highest value and highest priority. Go into detail on those two projects using the STAR method (although the STAR method is usually referred to when talking about interview prep, it's also a very good format for presentations). You can then do a one line synopsis of your last two projects on the last slide and just say ""and if you want to know more details about these two projects I will stick around after."" Make sure you can quantify what you did I.e. As a result this project saves 1 million/yr."
ChemicalEngineering,3cce4n,mhanders,2,Tue Jul 7 01:30:38 2015 UTC,"I think this response is very relevant. Don't be afraid to cut out crap to save time.   Show off what best sends the message of ""this intern brought value to our company""."
ChemicalEngineering,3cce4n,mushimushy,2,Tue Jul 7 07:41:31 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have the rough content from proper documentation of your work. Bringing it together does sound challenging, though. I'm no expert on this stuff but some things I would keep in mind:  1) Data visualization is a powerful tool. If you have some data and statistics to present, a graph or figure illustrating your findings are things people can easily digest and are really nice for summarizing key information in a compact fashion. Otherwise, highlight the key improvements, innovations, and accomplishments that you have made in any of the projects you worked on.  2) Agreed that a fancy presentation isn't necessary. Just make sure to use a clean, legible theme and really only have transitions to make bullet points (short bits of text, mind you) appear as you click through, so the audience isn't hit with the info all at once. A slide at the end with acknowledgements to your mentors, coworkers, and friends that helped you is also appreciated.  3) You don't want to be too rehearsed, but still confident. That requires some practice, and I memorize the ""buzz words"" or key action items to help jog the memory and keep talking about a series of bullet points naturally. Obviously during the presentation, you want to ensure you have proper posture and body language, eye contact throughout the audience, and appropriate speaking volume and tempo. If you have a laser pointer, practice using it. Try giving your presentation to a fellow intern or yourself in the mirror and see how you feel.  4) Use the serial positioning effect to your advantage. Go into your presentation with a introductory hook and end with strong conclusion that sells you, it is what your audience will think about after its over and leave an impression. The meat of your PowerPoint shows the evidence of your qualifications, but really drive it home at the beginning and end.  You don't have a lot of time to make your case, but with some solid preparation you can knock it out and get the job! Good luck."
ChemicalEngineering,3cce4n,brainwithnopurpose,2,Mon Jul 6 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"You don't want to be too rehearsed   That's not a bad thing. It really is not. In fact the more you rehearse it, the more natural it will be because you're not thinking about it as much."
ChemicalEngineering,3cce4n,pancak3d,2,Tue Jul 7 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the execs are (probably) not chemical engineers. You'd be surprised how detached they are some times from science and engineering. My advice is to skip the technical details and focus on the big picture. What was the problem, what did you do, what was the result (STAR method, as others have mentioned).  Also, some basic PowerPoint tips: Minimize your use of text. Use big fonts. Use graphs and relevant images wherever possible in place of text. Each slide should be simple and concise. More slides is better than too much on one slide. Information should come from you -- the PowerPoint should just be supplementary. Do not get this backwards!  As with others, I definitely disagree with not practicing. That's silly. If anything, practicing will make it come off more naturally. The key is to practice by using only your powerpoint as a guide; modify the powerpoint as you go to make it flow better and to make sure you hit all your talking points. Definitely don't write out a script and try to memorize it."

No one really has the power to help you get a job outright unless they are in the position to hire. Even then, unless you're (practically or literally) family, they might not stick their neck out too far on an unknown even if they like you. I have to think if they're anything like me, they might be wary of nepotism or cronyism, as well. But getting help with an interview is different because you're not just asking for a free pass, you're asking for a chance to prove yourself.  Anyway, this is just my  <5 years experience. I've helped friends get interviews but never as a guarantee. And when I was new, I hated asking for help because I wanted to earn it for myself but it wasn't just a skate in the park to get a job, either. And the job I got, I got because I was suggested for an opening at an entry level position by a friend of a friend of a recent colleague who was hiring (confusing, and I've never even met the intermediary).

You should be able to name at least 10 big ones that you wouldn't mind working for(oil & gas, pharma, specialty chemicals, manufacturing). and I would recommend avoiding pulp/paper.  Its not a bad starter internship, but you probably don't want to get stuck in that field because from my friends who have interned in pulp/paper they said its terrible.  Another option is to go into something totally different such as consulting or banking.  I knew people that now work for Barclays and Deloitte with chemical engineering degrees.

ChemicalEngineering,3c4mxg,CuantosAnosTienes,4,Sat Jul 4 19:06:38 2015 UTC,"PhD student in biopharma here. I have no experience in small molecule pharma, but on the bio side, there are several jobs that I've seen chemical engineers fill:  Upstream development: basically, making the drugs. This involves genetic engineering of cells and optimizing the bioreactor conditions to maximize drug production. There's some interesting applications of chemical engineering here (see metabolic engineering and modeling / control of bioreactor conditions).  Downstream development: designing the purification process for the drugs, once the cell culture is finished. This means designing chromatographic and filtration steps primarily, although there are other techniques less commonly used. Again, chromatography and membrane operations can both be described using chemical engineering analyses (thermodynamics of chromatographic interactions, kinetic and transport modeling, etc).  Formulation and product characterization: This field is sometimes closer to analytical biochem, but the application of protein thermodynamics means that its heavily populated by chemical engineers as well. I'm not as well versed on this subject, but maybe others can explain more.  In addition to development, chemical engineers also play roles in scale up / tech transfer, taking lab scale processes and making them work in existing facilities, and in running the actual manufacturing facilities.   Again, this is just my view on the subject, but I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any specific questions I might be able to answer."

A lot of research and most development require phds for you to make a lot of money. In manufacturing you can make a lot as a manager. But there's not one department that makes more than others at each level. Since I didn't want a PhD, I tried looking for small to medium sized companies to get in on the ground floor. Then if you excel you could be promoted quickly. For example, I've had two bosses with just bachelors in scientist level jobs because they worked hard and were in the right place at the right time. But based on what I've seen starting is about 40-70 and with a bachelors if you make your way up the chain you could feasibly make 100-150 but it all depends on how aspirational and lucky you are"

ChemicalEngineering,3c2odj,jerryvo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:51:15 2015 UTC,"There are many different people from around the world on this sub in chemical engineering, if they give their individual experiences it gives me a rough estimate of what its like."

ChemicalEngineering,3c2odj,complexannoyance,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:11:08 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. People with lower GPAs can get jobs based on their willingness to relocate, and their practical in-industry experience, as well as their ability interviewing."
ChemicalEngineering,3c2odj,mesorouth,3,Mon Jul 6 16:27:51 2015 UTC,"I found this interesting survey from Penn State for their ChE students at graduation. It gives a breakdown of grad school, employment, etc vs still looking. But also the still looking as a function of GPA.  http://www.che.psu.edu/corporate/employment.htm  The relationship is linear (3.2 is a 30% chance of still looking) with R squared of 0.982 It really shows how there isn't a clear 'cutoff gpa'. Of course part of the relationship is that the students who get good grades are more likely to be the ones looking for jobs well ahead of graduation. The other part being those same students probably have to do less work to find a job because they are more attractive candidates.  I'm curious to see their 2015 numbers."

Not sure why everyone was so against me ""looking for the single data points"" because it produced all these comments, useful information that I haven't been able to to find anywhere else.  But for finding an internship/co-op, would you agree that GPA is an important factor since, at that level, you really don't have any experience for employers to judge you for?  Just realized my college has a very similar survey, didn't realize. Spring 2015 numbers if anyone is curious. https://webapps.gatech.edu/cfcampus/adors/commencement/salary_report_result.cfm?college=TOTAL&level=1&surveyid=98&Submit=Submit"

ChemicalEngineering,3c2odj,jerryvo,2,Thu Jul 9 00:48:35 2015 UTC,My engineering college posts surveys given to recent grads and we consistently have ~85-90% of graduates that have moved on either full-time work or grad school.... And it's just a decent state university.
ChemicalEngineering,3c2odj,my_bullshit,2,Sat Jul 4 14:12:47 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen job growth prospects are null but positions should be relatively easy to find. There are quite a few retirement age people at every facility I've been to. That being said, there are also equal amounts of young people working as well. None of the facilities I've been to are looking to expand headcount but are willing to hire as the old guard leaves. (I guess this would have a negative net effect on relative supply of jobs, as more people graduate with CHE degrees, but keep in mind CHE graduates do MANY things, e.g. flipping burgers, professional school, HR, marketing, business, etc.) One more note, this applies mostly to career Chemical Engineers, there are MechE, NukE and others working in the chemical industry in basically the same positions as CHE. I'd say a little more than half of the professional CHE grads I know have moved on to management/business positions."
ChemicalEngineering,3c2odj,jerryvo,2,Sat Jul 4 14:40:53 2015 UTC,"As an individual with more than 40 years experience in many aspects of the field, I can say that ChemE is such a diversified field that not any one rule or observation applies. So your attempt at a data dump will never yield information you can use to plan on. I see huge growth as my generation retires. A struggling ""youngster"" may see opposite - in the plant next door. And let me give you a hint - the GPA counts only for the first job - perhaps. Your network is SO MUCH more important.  I could write a book or three answering your questions - perhaps I will some day."
ChemicalEngineering,3byzv2,IMKR1,4,Fri Jul 3 08:19:43 2015 UTC,"I've only started working in the past year, so all of my interview experience is from the entry level job point of view. During all of these interviews I was somewhere between 21 and 23.  In pretty much every interview I've been in, there are questions the interview clearly felt ""obligated"" to ask, and questions they were actually interested in the answer. These obligated questions tended to be the typical behavioral analysis questions: ""Describe a time you over came a challenge""; ""What is your one greatest strength, and why do you think they will serve you well here?""; ""Describe a time when you were working in a team with others who weren't pulling their weight. How did you resolve the issue and what was the end result? Would you do anything differently in the future based on that experience?""; etc.   I found that these questions were usually asked first, and give the interviewer some background on what experiences you've had in the past that go a little deeper than your resume (most of these questions lend themselves well to scratching the surface of points you really want to talk about, like previous jobs or a in-depth school project / senior design). However, as long as you don't say something super outrageous and come off as a somewhat normal person, these questions shouldn't be a problem. I find that they tend to be a way of the interviewer to ""test the waters"" so to speak, so that they know where to take the interview later.  As for the questions the interviewer is actually interested in, this is the meat and bones part of the interview. Typically you are going to be interviewed by someone with engineering experience, and they will actually be interested in the engineering stuff you've done in the past. And don't worry if you don't have professional experience yet; if you really understood your school projects or research work or the like, and you can communicate that effectively, these are really interesting too.   Typically this part of the interview will start with ""Tell me about a project you've worked on in the past"" / ""Tell me about your time at X company"" (from your resume). From there, it really tends to be like a conversation: you describe in broad strokes, diving into the points of emphasis you really cared about, and the interviewer will also drill down in areas they are intrigued by. Remember that it's not just about the pure engineering stuff: cost analysis, risk analysis, safety, team dynamics, managerial style, etc. can all be points of emphasis as well.  I've found in the past that the split is usually 25/75 in favor of ""meat and bones"" type questions / conversation; like I said, this really the part people are typically interested by. Since I can't really give you a good idea of what these questions will be, it's better to come into the interview prepared to talk about specific projects. Basically, if you listed a job experience on your resume, you should be able to organically discuss 1-3 relevant experiences from your time there during the conversation, if the interviewer highlights that job. And also understand that some parts of your resume may not be discussed at all. Some past jobs or extracurriculars or the like aren't super relevant to the position you're interviewing for, and that's ok.  As for other specific questions I remember being asked:   ""Why do you think diversity within an organization is important?"" ""Describe a time when a group did not agree with your point of view. How did you try to persuade them to see things your way? Were you successful? Would you do anything differently if you came across a similar situation in the future?"" ""Describe a time when you had a conflict with a friend or co-worker. What caused the conflict, and how did you resolve it?"" ""Do you prefer to work in a team setting or alone? Why?"""
ChemicalEngineering,3byzv2,Hacksaw8UM,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:48:28 2015 UTC,"Also, in every single interview I've been in, the interviewer asked me how much I knew about the company and position. While you probably won't know much about the specifics of the position other than what was listed on the initial job posting, you should definitely do research on the company online. Even if you really can't find out anything about them, you can at least mentioned that you looked and couldn't find much other than x y and z. Given the availability of information on the internet, interviewers do tend to expect you to have done a little bit of research on the company before the interview, as it shows you have interest in the position. I personally didn't follow this rule too well, and while it hasn't hampered me from getting jobs I've interviewed for, it does make things a little awkward during the interview when I have to tell them I haven't really done any research on their company.  Hope at least some of this helps!"
ChemicalEngineering,3byzv2,Hacksaw8UM,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:52:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  Interviewers don't expect you to be able to hammer off the company's latest financial report data or all of their major ventures but if they were in the news lately for something positive you could mention it.    When I ask interviewees that question, I am just expecting them to know what our core business is and maybe one factoid (where our HQ is located, anything they have heard about us or something they found when googled us)."

ChemicalEngineering,3byzv2,Barnlewbram,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"Were it me, I would phrase my answer as such:  ""I'm not entirely familiar with the process but what I do know is...""  When asked a technical question, the company is not only testing your knowledge but how interested you are in their industry. Most college students go to a career fair and apply everywhere without thought of what the company does or how it operates.  For example, a refinery for the most part is there to separate the components of crude oil. If you don't know the basics of a distillation column, you obviously have no idea what a refinery does.   The same applies with chemical plants, they could ask you what you know about the making of the chemical, you should at least know some type of reaction even if it isn't exactly what they do it shows that you have at least looked into the business in which the company operates.  Basically, you should have some idea of the question they will ask you if you are applying there just through researching what the company does."

While job hunting I've come across quite a few entry-level jobs that recommend or require you to have your EIT.

You might be able to take some intro courses and get past some of the remedial coursework if it's a path your interested in.  At least make sure you've taken some advanced math, but folks I knew in grad school did the change with fairly little."

I spent my Junior and Senior summers at two different General Chemical plants, they recruited me aggressively but ultimately I really didn't like the people or the dynamic at either facility.   2) First job out of school was for a start-up that had some novel membrane technology. They ultimately failed, but I couldn't resist taking a gamble on the huge stock options they were offering - had it paid off I'd be retired already.   3) I make catalytic converters, I suppose I'm as passionate about that as possible. Disabuse yourself of the notion that you have to love your job or that your job gives you purpose."

ChemicalEngineering,3btoo3,Weltal327,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:48:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I handled alarm management for our delta v system at one plant.  When we bought it, it had 3 alarm settings  Notification, Warning, and Critical.  My main focus with alarms is that if you have an audible alarm, you want an operator to be responding to do something about it.  I left all notification alarms as minor alarms.  These would not show up on the alarms page, but would be registered in the Delta V log.  They would have no visual or audio cue.  For warnings, these are the alarms that give an operator a chance to correct something before it becomes hazardous etc.  They would turn the block yellow, show up in the alarm log, but they would not give an operator an audio cue.  I also threw I/O bad into this category.  For anything critical, these are the type of alarms you consider shutting down the plant for.  That you need an operator to immediately respond and close a valve etc.  The block would turn red, the audio warning would sound, and for some VERY VERY critical alarms, we programmed in a pop-up.  Hope this helps."

Then again, the same teacher never worked a day in his life in industry other than in academia so i take whatever he said with a grain of salt and he got in PhD back in the 1970s. So as someone who is currently working, i'd say the starting salary of an inexperienced salary is what they are paying you at. $40k/year ? sounds good ! why ? you have nothing to leverage with, no experience , no nothing. After 5-6 years of experience then you can negotiate, but for now take it."

The only obstacles I've ever seen people come across are entirely mental. If you're worried a company is going to low ball you based on your current salary, then don't tell them your current salary or make up a number.   Unless you are in a ton of debt, I recommend picking your first job based on the experience it will provide you rather than the salary. Who cares if you make 45k or 70k for your first 3 years as an engineer if you are setting yourself up to make 200k down the road. Ask yourself if taking this job will make you a more valuable engineer, and if it does, go for it!   On a personal note, I interviewed at Genentech in San Diego like 6 years ago, I was impressed and would have been stoked if I got the offer."

I do not know myself whether this particular type of job would give me the type of experience I want because it's related to data entry and less about production/manufacturing or any of that sort, but I would get some experience working with the industry?  My main reason why I would consider this is because of what you mentioned as well; it's working with Genentech. I would really hope to work under the company after the contract, but others say it's unlikely with contract jobs. In addition, I was contacted not by a representative from Genentech, but by a third hiring company who saw my resume posted online. Who knows whether this is truly a job offer."

If the benefits don't outweigh salary after a bit and you still aren't getting what you want either ask for a raise or leave. After working there you could go to pretty much any biotech company.

ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,TiredPhilosophile,6,Mon Jun 29 09:26:08 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how are Sweden and Finland petroleum based?  But I do work in Norway as an Oil&Gas process engineer, so I can try to answer your question. So the main thing is that there is a lot of foreign engineers here, but so far I haven't met anyone from US. There is huge amount from UK and then India, Sri Lanka and some even from Africa, but these from Asia and Africa have usually first come to study in Norway and then later on continued to work here.  I personally can't really see any problem why engineer from US could not work here. Of course it would take some time to get used to working with NORSOK standards and the other Norwegian requirements, but those are not that different from other standards so it would not be a huge thing anyway. Then I would guess it would also take some time getting used to using more SI-units in stead of the feet and miles and whatnot, but again, probably very minor nuisance.  Then out of the office, it might be a small shock for you that the salary is probably smaller than what you would be getting in US, and at least the part after tax. But also, as health care is practically free, you don't have to have expensive insuranses for example. Which means, that you can easily live with the salary which is quite good in even in the Norwegian standards.   At the moment it has to be also said, that currently almost no Oil&Gas company in Norway is hiring, and the traffic is actually in some cases even to the other way and some companies have also temporarily laid of people, because there is too much engineering capacity and not that much work. The situation will get better, but at the moment it is anybody's guess when that will happen.  Not much else comes to my mind, but I'll gladly answer questions."
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,doorshavefeelingstoo,4,Mon Jun 29 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"I'm currently a chemical engineering student who studied abroad in Norway. I really liked the country before visiting and even more so afterwards. Learning the standards shouldn't be too difficult a problem and science here is typically done in SI units.  I know the differences in salary, and economically it would probably be a better choice for me to stay here due to lower taxes, but I'd be willing to give that up to live in a country I find much more appealing than the US. As long as the salary is moderately livable I will be completely fine with it.  Personally, I was thinking about applying to masters programs in Norway and studying there full time. That way I could really have a feel for how I like living in there. Also, a Norwegian degree may help in securing a job in the future (and give time for the economy to get better)  Thoughts?  Edit: My bad about Sweden/Finland being petroleum based, it's just misinformation.  Edit 2: I'm assuming it won't be too difficult to get a visa to study at Norwegian schools from the US, and then eventually permanent residency after getting a job, or will that be an issue?   Sorry for all the questions and thanks for your help."
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,doorshavefeelingstoo,2,Tue Jun 30 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"Oh the salary is of course good, my purpose was not say that it the salary is not good, oil&gas salaries are very good in Norway. It was just to point out the difference between US as the social security system etc. is quite drastically different.  I think coming to Norway for a Master's might be a very good idea. I just some weeks ago talked with an half-American guy (I think mother was Norwegian and father from US, family living in US) and he had also studied in Norway (I don't really know, if he did a Bachelor or Masters) and that also gave him a good path to our company. Of course he was also very very lucky as he managed to get through the door just before the employment situation worsened to the point it is now.  I'm sorry, but I don't really know about the visa and residence permit things as I'm from another Nordic country and we have very free and flexible systems between countries (even more flexible than within EU). When I moved to Norway, I literally just drove to Norway to my new apartment (which I had secured from the internet) with my stuff and only had to inform Skattetaten (Norwegian tax office which handles also the national registry) that ""I'm now moving to Norway"". I didn't even have to notify Finnish authorities as data is exchanged between Nordic countries systems and even that was automatically done for me.  Edit: Also, sorry for the delay as it's been quite hectic for me lately, haven't had much time to sit down and write."
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,peach_belinni,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:42:43 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, it seems that the oil&gas industry is simply down in Norway and I'll keep an eye on it see if it starts to rise back up.   It is pretty great how the Nordic countries have such a flexible system. Makes it really simple to move and visit the other countries. In my case, I just looked online and immigration shouldn't be too difficult if I get accepted to a university there, and then I just apply for a work visa which will lead to permanent residency.  Also, I'm glad you waited and gave me a legitimate answer rather than rushing. Thanks for all your help!"
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,doorshavefeelingstoo,2,Sat Jul 4 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to how much does language skills come into play? Do you need to have an excellent command of the local language to work ? Or can you get away with knowing only english? What about the operators, do they only use the local language ?"
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,cbmb,2,Mon Jun 29 18:11:32 2015 UTC,"Of course the language always helps with the every day life, but generally all oil and gas engineering work in Norway is done in English and that is also the official working language for most of the larger engineering companies. In my team there is French, Spanish, Portuguese, Finnish, Indian and Sri Lankan people in addition to Norwegians. I have only experience from engineering design side, but I'm almost certain that all the operators do speak English as well and I know that their work instructions are usually in English as well.   You can also manage with just English in every day life as pretty much everyone here speaks very good English. As I said, Norwegian skill helps, but you can easily manage without."
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,doorshavefeelingstoo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:44:35 2015 UTC,"health care is practically free   No it isn't they are taxing you for it vs. in the u.s. your employer pays for most of it, even if I subtracted the healthcare payments I make it comes out cheaper."
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,cbmb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:38:21 2015 UTC,"Of course that is true, that it is more like ""free"". But I also really doubt that US healthcare will be cheaper in the end for an average person not to mention a unemployed or poor person. But I don't of course have any data on this, just a hunch."
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,doorshavefeelingstoo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:32:01 2015 UTC,"Before I graduated college I was paying for my own healthcare and it came out to $3360/yr for really good health insurance and at the time I was poor. It still comes out cheaper considering I paid less in taxes. In the U.S. the poor don't really pay taxes, of course everyone pays social security and Medicare, but your federal taxes come back to you at the end of the year if you made below a certain threshold. I would rather pay less in taxes and get more of my check. Once you consider that as a chemical engineer I make more (~60-105k as a new graduate) and I pay less in taxes (25-28%) I still come out on top working here vs working in any other country."
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,cbmb,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"Very interesting information, I had not thought it that well through it seems.  For a comparison, I might as well give some (rough) numbers from  Norway. So Master's level starting salary is around 55-60k usd (current exchange rate) per year, from that around 35% income tax which leaves around 39k. Bachelor starting salary is I'd say some thousands lower.  The of course some other things might also come into consideration. For example, if you have family, state covers their health care as well as education, plus there is good paid parental leaves (for both parents) and 5 weeks of paid holiday per year (which rises the salary per yearly working hour). I don't have family and I'm a healthy guy, so in that sense I'm very much with you and would like to have the US system, but then again if I had some chronic illness or large family, then maybe the Norwegian way might be maybe better.  And of course then I would also need to consider that consumption taxation in Norway is probably much higher than in US, the around 25% value added tax in almost everything and other consumption taxes for example for fuel+car, alcohol, electricity etc. If the situation was somewhat closer before, this probably turns the tide to US advantage pretty much on all ""normal"" cases if only money flowing to account is considered."
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,resarf64,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"So with your numbers, it seems the U.S. is a good place when it comes to money flowing in pocket+education level. The numbers for salary I quoted were for just a bachelors degree. So, post tax, someone with a bachelors degree could make double the post tax of a masters degree in Norway (+money deducted from my paycheck for healthcare is done pre-tax).  When you say the state covers education for your family are you talking about college or are you talking about elementary, middle school, and high school (education prior to getting a bachelors degree)? If you have free college that's definitely a win for Norway because college costs are skyrocketing here.  If you already had a job and discovered a chronic illness I believe your employment becomes protected here. The bigger issue is a chronic illness after you retire when you no longer have the capacity to make money and you're paying for your own health insurance. It makes a lot of sense to retire in Norway.  I don't know much about consumption taxes. I think I pay $5.00 in tax/month for electricity but all of that is lumped into the bill and I don't pay attention to it. Gas in the u.s. Is the win because it's like $3.44/gal in my area right now and Google has told me that gas in Norway is $6.98/gal."
ChemicalEngineering,3bhrk2,Chasestthomas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:11:51 2015 UTC,"Yeh I would say in Scandinavia only Norway has a big oil and gas industry, Denmark has a small one as well.     I work for a US operator in the UK North Sea, and I guess that Norway is similar, the hardest thing would be a visa especially if you are inexperienced. Most grad jobs (in the UK anyway) require EU citizenship or to study here first.   As has already been said as well there is a real shortage of jobs atm, the North Sea has been hit probably the hardest, except maybe oil sands, by the oil price crash. There's a hell of a lot of graduates for not many jobs in a mature basin.   Good luck, no harm in trying."

At 22, you could comfortably purchase it on your own. As you became older, it would become prohibitively expensive. My parents, who are in their early 60s, are self-employed and so must pay the whole cost of their health insurance themselves. For the two of them, it was something like $17,000 a year the last I checked, and that was for very basic, high deductible coverage.  Similarly it is likely that you would not receive any kind of retirement benefits, and wouldn't be guaranteed paid time off for little life events like the birth of a child."

ChemicalEngineering,3bf0sx,pmacdon1,2,Sun Jun 28 23:05:58 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly true. Obamacare has made insurance cheaper for elderly people (and made insurance available to people with preexisting conditions) by making it more expensive for everyone else. A young, 30-year-old friend of mine with a wife and son saw his premiums almost double.  It also provides subsidies for people who fall below certain income levels. I don't know the particulars, but I doubt that OP would be eligible, even at 50% salary. (It also seems a little sleazy to me to take advantage of a subsidy like that which was really intended to help out the underprivileged.)"

ChemicalEngineering,3bf0sx,pmacdon1,2,Mon Jun 29 00:21:05 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I just checked, and for two 60 year olds, bare bones coverage would run about $7000/year before any credits.

ChemicalEngineering,3bf0sx,claireauriga,2,Sun Jun 28 20:22:11 2015 UTC,"Unless you're some super-duper expert consultant, it's unlikely.

ChemicalEngineering,3beyb3,LessThanJewish,5,Sun Jun 28 16:45:13 2015 UTC,"Graduating in March might be one of your big problems.  Companies primarily hire in September - November for positions that start in June through August, and hire in February - April for positions that start in January and February.  There are certainly exceptions for this because companies might not meet their quotas, people might not graduate, or people might decide to reject an offer last minute.  Once you are out of the hiring cycle, you're competing for a much smaller pool of jobs than if you're looking for a job during the normal career fair cycle.  Here are a couple of pointers for when the hiring cycle starts back up:   Read the FAQ of this subreddit.  https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/wiki/faq The ability to put your resume in the hands of a human is much more valuable than just applying online.  Take advantage of your university's career fair to do this. Network with your friends who graduated and found jobs.  They are much more likely to be able to put your resume in the hands of a hiring manager than if you just applied online. Put your GPA on resume.  I automatically assume that you have less than a 3.0 since you don't have it on there. You're framing your work experience incorrectly.  You need to focus not only on technical achievements but also leadership and teamwork elements of what you did.  The jobs you're applying for won't need you to do ""Topographic mapping of hydrocarbons with magnetically active bacteria"" in all likely hood.  They will need you to collaborate with a cross functional team to develop solutions to blah blah blah.  Stress less on what you did and more on how it will help you perform at the company where you will be doing something completely different The way that you describe your leadership experience doesn't give any information on your leadership qualities.  Do some research on leadership qualities/skills and use your positions to explain how you represent a key quality.  Here is a resource I found with a 5second google search: http://leadership.uoregon.edu/resources/exercises_tips/skills Get rid of the formatting that is kicking your resume onto 2 pages.  You don't have enough relevant content to justify using 2 pages."

I am mainly interested in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries   Just take a job. Go to your engineering career fair, interview IN PERSON as much as you can. Take any engineering job you can find. It doesn't matter if you are interested. You don't want to be the guy who can't find a job after graduating. Most people already had jobs before they graduated. Just take a job now. You can find a different job after you have some experience.  Side note: Make sure your resume is only 1 page. If you have a ton of experience it can be longer, but you are a recent college grad, you don't have enough experience to justify a resume more than one page.

He could have had a part time lab tech position that he's calling an internship. And it's not at all difficult to get published as an undergrad. You could run a few experiments that some grad student designed and still get put on a paper as the last author. Many employers are aware of this.  At the end of the day, he got a job and that's all that matters, but I think his advice is bad nine times out of ten. All things being equal, six internships is fantastic.

ChemicalEngineering,3bcz2m,kuna1995,3,Sun Jun 28 01:20:24 2015 UTC,"I switched from BS in chem to BS in chemE 2 years into my program.    I didn't see much difference because I switched relatively early where the preliminary courses were the same.  The biggest difference I observed between the curriculum is that science programs focus on giving you tools for research while engineering gives you tools for problem solving.  Through college I learned my interest is to apply science rather then further it.  So in retrospect I'm glad I did because I feel the undergrad program gave me enough tools to not only WORK as an engineer but as a chemist  as well.  It might be different for you though because I didn't have aspirations of grad school, a PhD or research.    If you are interested in research one thing you need to understand is that scientists focuses on pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge, an engineers focus on utilizing the understanding of science to achieve goals.  So there research in each field will differ, especially at a PhD level.  Ultimately a four year degree can only arm you with the tools.  To make yourself competitive in your career goals, relative internships or research experience will prove that you are committed to the gatekeepers in your field"

One thing I'll add is that the benefits you get for being an engineer instead of a chemist diminish as you get more advanced degrees.  Job prospects are much better for a ChemE BS and than a Chemistry BS, but I think a ChemE PhD wouldn't necessarily have better job prospects than a Chemistry PhD.

I think it's just the nature of having a community where people can ask for advice or vent about problems they have in common with others.  In my opinion, I think you would be fine with a PhD in Chemistry.  It's a tough advanced degree that can have a lot of industrial relevance.  You can't really go wrong with it if you're motivated enough to do it."
ChemicalEngineering,3bcz2m,Panda_Muffins,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:45:39 2015 UTC,"You can, yes, but realize you will be at a disadvantage. I'm not sure what stage of your undergraduate career you're at, but ChemE and chemistry have vastly different undergraduate curricula. If you got accepted to a ChemE grad program, you'd have to do quite a bit of catch-up work. I just applied to ChemE grad programs, and on all my visiting weekends I only knew 1 person that just did chemistry in undergrad (a few people did things like a double major in general engineering and chemistry). So, it's not impossible by any means, but you'll be competing with people that have a better background than you, especially at highly-ranked institutions if that's something you're looking at. I'm not sure if you're looking at a master's or a PhD, but if it's a master's it may mean you take longer than the average student to catch up on classes such as engineering thermo, fluid dynamics, heat/mass transfer, and process principles.  As for job prospects, ChemEs seem to have better job prospects at the BS level, but I don't necessarily think a ChemE PhD is by and far better off than a chemistry PhD (assuming you're interested in a PhD). It really would depend what area you specialized in more than the actual degree name."
ChemicalEngineering,3bcz2m,Panda_Muffins,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:50:12 2015 UTC,So if i got a PhD in Chem i would be just as well off as a PhD in Chemical Eng?
ChemicalEngineering,3bcz2m,maxjnorman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:28:26 2015 UTC,"The research opportunities in both are very much related. I would say that the opportunities based on the name of the degree alone are about equal. Like I said, it'll depend far more with what area you do research in. If you do research on biomaterials (whether in chemistry or ChemE), that might be better than doing research in organic synthesis for instance (note: I just made this up to make a point). Since the two degrees overlap so much on a research level, it's really going to be the area you concentrate in that matters most."
ChemicalEngineering,3bbw0e,OhmMyGauss,7,Sat Jun 27 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, here is a map of ChemE hotspots in America with the metropolitan hotspots highlighted here. For plenty more information, find the bls.gov article here.  Now for my $0.02:  The Boston area is a huge hub for the biotech side of ChemE (e.g. EMD Millipore, Biogen, Genzyme, Amgen, Merrimack, Pfizer, tons of start-ups). Since Boston is also a hub or computing, you'll find engineering computing companies here too (Aspen, Mathworks, COMSOL, Wolfram, etc.). A few other companies I can think of off the top of my head are Aramco and Exponent, but you'll find a lot more results by Googling. As far as med schools in the Boston area, there's Tufts, BU, UMass, and of course Harvard."

Your girlfriend will quickly come to the realization that you apply to a ton of schools get into 1 or 2 and you go to one of those. It's not worth applying again next year to get into an ideal location.   You need to be prepared to move to wherever she gets in if you want to make the relationship work. Your best bet is to move to the state where she has residency and start your career there, statistically that is where she has the best shot of getting in."

ChemicalEngineering,3b8ay5,prologio,12,Fri Jun 26 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"There aren't any bachelors degrees that are going to make you an ideal candidate for an R&D position. You just don't learn enough in undergrad to be able to contribute original thoughts to the field. That ability comes with experience.   Switching majors now is just going to put you a year behind and won't increase your prospects of getting the kind of job you're after. You've got two paths. One, graduate school. The disciplines in grad school aren't as sharply defined as they are in undergrad, you can pretty much work on any type of project in any field you want if you can convince a professor you're smart enough to make positive contributions. This will immediately put you in the R&D world, and pave your way to keep that sort of position in the future. That being said, graduate programs are very difficult. You're expected to take classes, do 30-40 hours of research a week, write and publish papers, give presentations etc, etc, etc... All for 15$ an hour if you're lucky, and no raises for the next 5 years.   Other option is to find a job in industry and get experience that way. Believe me, ChE jobs are nothing like what you do in school. That's why internships are so important. Spend 5 years working interesting positions and gain enough experience to pursue your own ideas.   Point is, the engineers developing and working on new products are the ones who have dedicated themselves to becoming experts on certain topics, not any joe shmo who picked a particular undergraduate major.   I would bite the bullet, finish the degree, then start putting in the time to really learn something."
ChemicalEngineering,3b8ay5,Jokiesamoster,5,Fri Jun 26 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"Plenty of my peers in school didn't enjoy ChemE but wanted the money.  It doesn't sound like this is you...you have a passion but are worried that you might not be able to get into with your path.   Have you done any research for professors yet? Internships? The easiest way to get into R&D out of school is to have some background or work experience in it.  Also, I know there are some ChemE's who have managed to get into an R&D role with just an undergrad but I find that most R&D employees have some sort of higher level degree (Masters or PhD).    I guess my answer is...decide what type of R&D interests you.  Then  decide if your current curriculum suits that path or not."
ChemicalEngineering,3b8ay5,loungecat,2,Fri Jun 26 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"Like many others and yourself, I was the in the same boat. I started in chemistry, but you hear all the horror stories, and the pay in ChemE sounds great, and isn't it just applied chemistry with lots of math? Yeah, well, you and me both know that's not the case, and it'll become even clearer into your fourth year suffice to say.  That being said, if you're in your third year, it might be too late to switch, so I'd check that out. You probably don't want to add on more time to your undergraduate career. If you have the chance to take classes outside of the main ChemE curriculum, check out classes in your interest (e.g. upper level quantum, surface chemistry, statistical mechanics). This will prevent you from being miserable.  I don't necessarily know if switching to MechE would make you feel any better. Most MechE undergrads I know don't delve much into physics. The whole field of engineering is approached quite differently from ""pure"" science, so I wouldn't get your hopes up.   If you want to go into R&D, like most others here have said, you usually need a more advanced degree, most oftentimes a PhD (or multiple years in industry). If you have done research and enjoy it, this path may be an option. You wouldn't even have to switch out of ChemE for your PhD since the graduate work and research end of ChemE is so blurred it might as well be a mix of chemistry, MechE, ChemE, so on and so forth. If you haven't done research, I'd give it a go and see.   Regardless, talk to your adviser. That's his/her job. Tell your adviser what your interests are both academically and for a career and see what that person says. If your adviser sucks, talk to someone else in the department you like. These are professionals in their field and may be able to provide insight."
ChemicalEngineering,3b8ay5,Panda_Muffins,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:06:11 2015 UTC,"Ha, I also began a ChE degree thinking I would actually do stuff with chemistry. It's a bit of a disappointment.   I'm a senior now. I'm starting to apply to grad schools for atmospheric science with a focus on atmospheric chemistry. They like that my undergrad has all the thermo/physics that many earth science undergrads do not. So if this goes as planned, I'll get to do my chemistry stuff anyway"
ChemicalEngineering,3b8ay5,btbama22,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:22:30 2015 UTC,"Alright you sound like me in sophomore year. Much more interested in theoretical/fundamental stuff than Process Engineering or manufacturing. Maybe you don't have an internship yet, and you should be a bit worried. Getting a job before graduating will probably be really hard without a good one where you will establish good connections or have meaningful work.   I'm not sure about switching, but don't be afraid to take an extra semester or year. You're going to need that extra time to work on a couple research projects to build good relationships with professors and take on a few summer internships or co-ops. Even if you're sure that you want to go to grad school, do both research and co-ops. If you're sure you're going to work, work experience goes a lot further than research but it doesn't sound like you want to do much of the entry level jobs around.   Don't be afraid to switch majors and don't be afraid to stay in school longer, especially if you're paying resident tuition at a state school. It takes time not only to find out what you want to do, but also what you need to do to make what you want to do happen. ChemE isn't just chemistry with a bunch of math and I don't think anyone should be choosing this major without having work experience in it. You're setting yourself up for a lot of frustration if you don't take the time now to figure out what you will love to do."

ChemicalEngineering,3b4hv9,merphaderp,7,Thu Jun 25 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"Static is caused by gas particles moving in 1 direction, polarising the casing or fluid you're working with. Loads of fluids exhibit this behaviour. How you guard against it is you""ground"" the object. That means you attach a wire to the case and to an earthing rod. Any static generated will flow into the ground and away from your casing."
ChemicalEngineering,3b4hv9,JimsFlight,2,Fri Jun 26 01:55:56 2015 UTC,"For this to work, you need a metal casing or other conductive casing otherwise you'll only have localized discharge depending on the size of your vessel."
ChemicalEngineering,3b4hv9,EngineeringSolution,3,Fri Jun 26 11:47:05 2015 UTC,Jet Fuel often has an additive that dissipates static in the fluid itself.

ChemicalEngineering,3b4hv9,Rossay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"Static can be prevented by bonding all piping and vessels/equipment and then grounding the system (wire/rod to earth, can be via structural steel or something similar). This can be achieved through conductive piping (any metallic piping system). If the piping is lined (usually non-conductive) you can use grounding rings, spikies (for flanged pipe), grounding & bonding straps, or look into carbon filled linings/resins to make it conductive.  Static can be dangerous if discharging through a lining (i.e. plastic or FRP) as well as if there is anything flammable. Also can potentially discharge through equipment (flowmeter or something) if that is an easier path to ground."

I'd say:  -Study potential job paths and the common skills, requirements, and roadblocks. Getting onto a job path early (and learning the skills you need to get the internship you need, etc) can make a huge difference in actually getting that job.   -Seek out topics that interest you and study those. Coursera is great for that. If you're in a city, go to MeetUps that interest you.   -Learn some/more programming skills.

Seconding programming skills, especially of you can find out what languages your classes might use. Basic programming is going to make your life a lot easier at some point.

My recommendation is to work at your company, let them pay for school, and you take half online, half in class courses and burn through it until you get the master's. After that go for your Phd basically anywhere you want. Although by that point I doubt you're going to want to give up 80-90K a year for 30K.

ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,teerav42,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:38:29 2015 UTC,OP is coming to their program with a 4.0 GPA. He can ask them before he even starts. I'm not sure where you went but my college had pretty reasonable people. Maybe your topic on catalysis wasn't strong enough. Didn't you have conversations with your professor's about it first? You don't just get handed a topic (in the US at least).
ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,HockeyandMath,4,Thu Jun 25 05:02:44 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely not true for most of the top tier US programs. There is an advisor selection process after you start classes, and for the most part, professors are not allowed to guarantee spots. Also, GPA is only one factor professors will use to rank their selections. I would say GRE scores, exam scores during the first semester,  and previous research experience are just as if not more important."
ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,BuzzingGator,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:03:37 2015 UTC,Semiconductor is niche...? It's huge in the Pacific Northwest and I thought there are hotbed areas in Texas too.   What specifically were you researching and what types of jobs were you willing to go for? I thought Intel and others were all over ChemE PhDs with semiconductor experience. Though I can understand avoiding the field for other reasons.
ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,elamo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"I can relate to your sentiments about lack of job choice, security, and location. I've also thought plenty about transitioning to CS and understand if that's what you choose to do.   I don't mean to be too harsh, but how were you going about job apps? It sounds like you weren't necessarily reaching out to people and instead trusting their automated systems. If this is true, I think you should really try cold-contacting. With your background, you should be getting job offers. I think many people would be happy to point you towards better people to talk to, or even just ask you to interview if they have the authority. It'll be spam sometimes, but I'll guarantee it's a better return on your time."
ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,elamo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:17:01 2015 UTC,"You're really limiting yourself with that mentality.   -Firstly, you really don't need to be so direct that it feels like asking for a fast track interview. You can express interest in their product/research, mention your related background, and ask if they have advice for someone breaking into the industry. Most people like to give advice. At worst, spam takes 1 second to dismiss... I think we can agree the expected value is very positive.   -I agree hitting a recruiter/HR/other applicant bottleneck might not be the most effective (but still worthwhile). So try to target an engineer who doesn't get hit up all the time. They can relate to your situation, they feel good if a few minutes of their time can make a difference to your job search, and they get to build a ""connection"" (who has a prestigious PhD, no less). They scratch your back and maybe in the future you can scratch theirs. Business guys are all over this sort of thing.  -You seem to be assuming companies prefer you to just submit your resume online. Yes, online apps are good for efficient logistics. But they're also expensive, they're a lot of work when they get flooded with resumes, and they don't have any human judgement about how you communicate/behave (meeting someone in person would really help here, or maybe settle for a phone convo). Many companies prefer hiring outside of online apps, and they often have personnel needs that are not posted online. Reaching out first gives you much better odds at finding the diamond in the rough."

It can be a very valuable experience, but if you're in it for the wrong reasons it can be a waste of time at best and a miserable experience at worst.  I don't want to discourage you from going for a Ph.D at all, but in my opinion the only reason you should pursue one, especially in engineering where there are plenty of opportunities with a BS or MS, is if you really, really want to.   Source: Started an engineering Ph.D without thinking it through enough, am bailing with an MS"
ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,bulkthehulk,2,Thu Jun 25 19:40:24 2015 UTC,What does really want to mean? For what specific reasons? Does wanting a really interesting job count?
ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,elamo,2,Thu Jun 25 20:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, for what specific reasons.  Is there a certain topic (maybe energetic materials from your original post?)  that you're very passionate about and want to become an expert in?  Is your goal to get a very specialized research job where you're working on cutting edge stuff?  If the answer to one or both of those questions is yes, then a Ph.D. is probably a good idea.  If by ""really interesting job"" you mean being able to move up in a company and manage entry-level engineers, or getting into the business side of the company, you're probably better off working.  In those types of positions, the extra experience will probably benefit you more than the Ph.D. in most cases.  Edit:  I'm sorry, I just realized you weren't OP.  But I think the term ""good job"" or ""very interesting job"" is too vague.  Ph.D's are helpful, or even necessary, for some jobs and useless for others, but I wouldn't say the Ph.D. jobs are objectively better.  If you like research they are, and if you don't then they aren't."
ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,bulkthehulk,5,Thu Jun 25 21:01:24 2015 UTC,"I was in the same position as you. You should put together a list of schools you're interested in and look at the faculty in each department. If a school's chemistry PhD department has more faculty you're interested in than their ChemE department, you know which program to apply to at that school. It's okay to have a mix of programs, and some schools (notably MIT) let you apply to multiple departments. So, that's my first suggestion.  My second suggestion is that you should not worry too much about not liking ChemE and pursuing a ChemE PhD. The ChemE life as a PhD student is so different from the process engineering curriculum you had in undergrad, and most of your PhD will (hopefully) be doing a project that you love. There will be a ton of ChemE professors that do research at the intersection of chemistry and materials, so you don't have to worry about that. Like I said, look at top schools and see which faculty interest you most. Worry about the name of the degree second. This is partially because at most universities you're not bound to work for somebody in the department you do your PhD in. If you're working as a ChemE PhD but someone in the material science department is interesting to you, then you can likely join that person's group without a problem. A lot of times professors are even cross-listed between multiple departments.   The final thing I'd suggest is to think about what you want to do after your PhD. If you want to go into academia and are dead set on being a ChemE professor, then do the ChemE PhD. Otherwise, it doesn't matter. If you want to go into industry and are interested in stereotypical ChemE areas of work (e.g. oil and gas, process engineering, etc.), then I'd also suggest the ChemE PhD path since connections will be better and they're looking for ChemEs. However, in all likelihood you're not entirely sure what you want to do after your PhD and aren't that picky at this point in time, which means it makes little difference what the name of your PhD is.   You will only be taking classes for the first two years or so. Research is your priority. Just look at where the faculty you're interested in work and apply there.  Oh, and another side-note I just thought of. Some chemistry PhD programs require (or highly suggest) the chemistry GRE, which you probably don't want to take, so this may help make the decision easier for some institutions.  Yet another side-note. It may also be to your advantage to consider the degree of selectivity for each type of program. For instance, MIT's ChemE PhD program is probably one of the most selective programs -- even including other discplines -- in the country. MIT's material science PhD program is still really selective, but I'd be willing to bet it's less competitive than the ChemE department, for instance. Ideas to toy around with, but that might be getting into too much admissions mindgames.  Like I said, I was in the same position as you. I ended up making an extremely difficult choice between a few top ChemE PhD programs and a less traditional PhD program at another top institution. I went with the latter, and after talking with faculty at half a dozen institutions about the decision, it doesn't make that much of a difference. It will, however, affect which schools are the best in their field though. For instance, Harvard is great for chemistry but not great for engineering (they don't even have ChemE). Despite doing a PhD in a different field from ChemE, I'll be working on things that would likely be in the ChemE department at other institutions. All the disciplines are a blur at the research level. Anyway, good luck! That's all the advice I have.  tl;dr -- take a look at the US News World Report's Top 20 schools in ChemE, Materials, and Chemistry, and then go to each school's page and find out which department has the faculty you're most interested in. Apply there."

ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,TooManyShits,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:19:01 2015 UTC,"Stay with the company you're interning with.   A good working situation is hard to find, and older people always recommend taking more time before pursuing education. Maybe so you can figure out precisely what you want to study. ChemE PhD's are very tough... I've heard lots of regrets and two of my friends have already quit their programs to find jobs. I'm not saying they're not worthwhile, just that a good job is the right choice until you're more sure about it."
ChemicalEngineering,3azgt4,elamo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:08:23 2015 UTC,"If you are really as smart as a 4.0 suggests, you have a tolerance for risk, and you are interested in developing new technology, you should go on to get your PhD.    Personally, I believe that there needs to be more bright minds going on to get advanced technical degrees with the objective of forming their own company.  Yes it is not easy, but society is not developing technology outside of computer hardware and software fast enough to sustain mankind.  There is a dire need for innovative technology; overall, the world needs to be more efficient and effective.  I do not specialize in energetic materials, but I could see many applications in the field of nanotechnology.  I found this paper very interesting http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v7/n3/full/nchem.2161.html#affil-auth.  They suggested that alkali metals explode in contact with water due to evacuating electrons which induce a coulomb explosion between the slow moving nuclei left behind.  Harnessing this technology could be useful in breaking down biodegradable materials faster or even treating cancer. I am sure you could think of other great ideas too.  This is a little more abstract, but I think you would be interested in protein dynamics, such as making molecular motors by designing proteins.  Again, when it comes down to it, you are really just interested in the movement of atoms due to changes in electron configuration.  Doing this project, you could even get into photonics to provide energy to the protein to induce motion.  If you like the city of Seattle and nanotechnology, you should look into University of Washington's interdisciplinary molecular engineering program.  They have an expansive list of professors in every department, so I think it would be impossible not to find a project that interests you."

ChemicalEngineering,3awk98,Kenny__Loggins,2,Wed Jun 24 02:26:21 2015 UTC,"A co-op for most companies involves a 40-hour work week. Assuming the co-op isn't anywhere near your school, the only classes you'll be able to take are online, and I wouldn't really recommend it unless you need to (and if you do, just take a low-credit elective or something you need to get out of the way anyway).  More often than not (unless you took a buncha AP credit), this will set you back a semester or two. keep this in mind.   Also keep in mind that 90% of the time, the extra semester with the co-op under your belt is worth it. Real world experience is invaluable.   EDIT: Some schools offer a course called ""Co-operative education"" or something similar, which more or less keeps you enrolled as a full-time student even though you are away for work, because some scholarships require full-time registration at a university, etc. Look into it and see if your school offers one."
ChemicalEngineering,3awk98,darkgrenchler,2,Wed Jun 24 03:14:33 2015 UTC,I have a question regarding co-ops as well. Is it possible to do a co-op if your are in a Master's program?
ChemicalEngineering,3awk98,ChemistryToChemE,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"The oil & gas company I co-oped with for 3 terms during undergrad let me do a 4th term the summer between undergrad and grad school, as long as I could prove that I would indeed be attending grad school following the co-op term. They also expressed interest in letting me do yet another term during my MS program, but that 4th term and potential 5th term could have been largely due to the good rapport I had already built up within my department. I think it would be much more difficult to get a foot in the door for a first co-op term as a Masters student than as an undergrad.   Assuming you're talking about a MS in engineering program, I think the bigger issue will be taking a leave of absence in the middle of your program. Most programs I am familiar with are very research-intensive, meaning that your project could be sitting idle (or at least much less productive) while you're gone. This might be a hard sell to most advisers/PIs, who rely on your results & data from current projects to apply for grants for new or continuing projects.   All of that is based on my experience, ymmv significantly."

I'd go with whatever interests you first and then get an internship in that area to get a feel for the job. I have no idea how internships work in Romania but in the US, doing an internship in one field won't limit your future career in possibly a different field.

I also know that there are online courses offered for learning DeltaV, but these require that you have access to a DeltaV sandbox which your co-workers may or may not have configured on-site (or you could try to get server space at one of our data centers). I would recommend you attend all company-wide meetings if you have the opportunity.

You can trend any instrumented process condition, and see how different things affect each other, and once you get used to what you should be trending and how things work at the plant you can optimize controls from Delta-V.    We do DOE (design of experiment) on our reagents through Delta V where I worked, and it basically would do every combination of reagent rates (within limits), and we would dig through the Delta-V after to figure out which reagent rates were optimal.

A company in the south west has even paid for their kitchen staff to go to college and train. I love their work culture :)  It makes me very disheartened when I see all the posts on here talking about their trouble getting jobs After all their college work.

Is it mainly operations based or design office?  I am wanting to stay design based.     Cheers in advance,"
ChemicalEngineering,3aqa3r,WilliamLooby,2,Mon Jun 22 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"Pharma, biotech and medical devices rule the roost here really, there's room for you in the semiconductor industry if you have a PhD.   I am on a phone so can't go too in depth, but I just checked this site and most of them are recruitment agencies. The majority of jobs are never posted here as the industry is small and everyone knows each other.   You'd very likely be operations, manufacturing, process engineering and the like.  http://www.irishjobs.ie/Chemical-Engineer-Jobs  Is England in bad shape also?

I'll spend more time on that tomorrow but on first glance they aren't asking for too much experience.  I've got a masters and I graduated in 06 so have a bit of time behind me.   You could probably get a job in Manchester region if you wanted to go into nuclear (unsure about difficulties getting clearance but there are plenty of foreigners working with me).  I'm wanting away as it is very slow, It's annoying how slow decisions get made.  The job market is slow as the oil and gas people are still coming in.  The market will suffer again when it picks back up and they go back.   I just assumed that Ireland had health cover.  That's something I'll have to consider though at the moment I'll take most jobs if it gives me something I'll like.     Thanks again,"

ChemicalEngineering,3arw30,funkyted,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:41:40 2015 UTC,So it looked like theres a lot of overlap between the two fields in the area that I wanted to study (environmental toxicology) so I figured I could go either way
ChemicalEngineering,3arw30,annamollyx,3,Tue Jun 23 00:59:45 2015 UTC,If you were not an engineering undergrad and you want an engineering job then I definitely think you need to get a masters in it. PhD is up to you but I don't think is necessary. I haven't heard of a masters being paid for but if you can get that that would be sweet
ChemicalEngineering,3arw30,at_work_alt,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:16:49 2015 UTC,"I realize these are pretty basic questions, but I've seen some posts around here regarding how a masters in engineering aren't worth much.   A master's isn't worth much if you already have an engineering undergrad. It is very valuable if you want to get into engineering from another field.   Additionally, some of the faculty I spoke to said that it may be possible for me to get a masters paid for if I can get a professor to sponsor me. I'm not sure how common this is, but this seemed almost too good to be true.   This is actually pretty much standard if you pursue the thesis option. I wouldn't even look at a program that didn't offer a full graduate assistantship."

It's possible, but you have to really sell yourself."
ChemicalEngineering,3aqjse,lessavyfav68,4,Mon Jun 22 18:21:13 2015 UTC,Which books would you recommend reading before it in order to fully understand it?   I've been studying mass transfer by first reading Welty's take on the subject and then reading some of BSL to get more details. It works very well and I recommend it.
ChemicalEngineering,3aqjse,vingnote,4,Mon Jun 22 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think there's much you can or should read before diving into BSL. The BSL text is an absolutely fantastic book on the subject (I mean, it was the first of its kind after all!). Still, it is a very difficult text to read at the undergraduate level if you really want to be able to understand everything going on and all the mathematical nuances that are between the lines, so to speak.   That all being said, make sure you have a good background in multivariable calculus and, especially, differential equations (although they will teach you all the differential equation techniques you need to know for the most part). They'll also teach you how to deal with tensors if you don't know that already. Beyond that, BSL is meant to be read as a first-course (as well as a reference later on), so don't feel like there is anything you should read before you start it. If you want to begin reading it, I'd start with getting an idea of how to do things like a (shell) momentum balance and what boundary conditions are in the context of fluid dynamics. That's all in the first couple of chapters, but it will take time to digest."
ChemicalEngineering,3aqjse,Panda_Muffins,5,Tue Jun 23 01:03:39 2015 UTC,"You need to have a strong background in differential equations, multivariable calculus, and mass and energy balances.  So if you haven't taken either of those classes you are hosed.  Also, BSL is one of the HARDEST college text books I ever tried to read.  You really have to focus, work example problems, and reread sections to get anything out of BSL."

ChemicalEngineering,3ark0z,jgc11,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:22:19 2015 UTC,"Talk to your career services department at your university. In addition to helping you with your resume and interview skills, they'll definitely host career fairs with companies looking to hire interns (assuming your university is big enough).  Otherwise, look into the industries that are big wherever you are, and try to hunt down a real person at one of those companies to hand your resume to. My experience is that actually getting your resume to the hands of someone who wants to hire you is a lot easier in person than by dropping it into some database online. Some of my classmates used to get internships at small firms with 2-10 engineers that didn't even want to hire interns in the first place--but they hired people who approached them asking to work."
ChemicalEngineering,3ark0z,Rafv,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"For all 4 of my undergraduate summer internships I approached them directly with a speculative application.  Use google to find interesting local engineering companies. Try to find the name and email address of someone in technical, as sales/admin people will usually ignore speculative applications.  Email them a copy of your CV and a cover letter explaining that you're interested in a career in X (whatever they do) and tentatively asking if they have any outstanding work that could be done by an intern.  Sometimes Engineering Manager's don't realize that an Intern is exactly what they need to help cover an engineer's extended holiday, a 'surge' in workload or a new development project until your email hit's their inbox."
ChemicalEngineering,3aovnj,jpark170,5,Mon Jun 22 08:16:39 2015 UTC,"without help from contacts or family members you are definitely in a rough spot. I was in a similar position when I started but if you have the degree and the mind for it, hope isn't gone but it's an uphill battle at best.  I would say to also look for technician jobs at places that also hire engineers and look to get involved as much as possible, with the hope that you'll be hired as an entry level engineer after ""proving yourself"" as a technician. Unfortunately not all places are open to this type of movement within a company so you may have to dig and do some homework on reviews from current/former employees. Being a manufacturing technician is loads better for your long-term prospects than being a chef."
ChemicalEngineering,3aovnj,ChemicalJ,5,Mon Jun 22 13:43:40 2015 UTC,"Graduating with a degree doesn't guarantee a job. If you did nothing but attend classes for 4 years, then yes, you may have wasted those 4 years.  Post your resume for feedback. If you have experience (internships/activities), relocation flexibility, OK GPA, etc. then you shouldn't have had a problem finding something within a year. If you don't, then it might be easier to land an internship/temp job first to get some experience."
ChemicalEngineering,3aovnj,burdlinsky,2,Mon Jun 22 09:11:41 2015 UTC,"Well, here's my resume.   I have OK GPA.

Most of the time the requirement says that internship is only available to current student."
ChemicalEngineering,3aovnj,IowaStateGuy,9,Mon Jun 22 09:43:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry man, just a 20 second glance at your resume I would consider you a non hire.    Don't put your projects on your resume unless you did something out there that benefited someone greatly. Everyone goes through the same project you do so it doesn't put you somewhere apart. Now, if you did a design project that did better than the company sponsor and saved them millions, then I would be impressed. Other than that this is just filler to me. No results, your resume is just full of a to-do list. Anyone can do a to-do list, but going above that and creating improvement is another thing.  Lab experience is again a filler, only add that when you're taking a lab job (which very few chemical engineering positions are needed for that)   Internships/work experience is a requirement for a lot of companies. That is why they push it so much while you're in school.  It's going to be really tough for you to find a job in the future like this. I'm sorry to say, but I hate it when people sugar coat stuff to me and it seems like you were looking for a straight answer. It's not that your brother lucked out by being a MechE, but it's because you didn't prepare enough to get ready outside of college."
ChemicalEngineering,3aovnj,A_Chem_Eng_Prof,2,Mon Jun 22 10:23:45 2015 UTC,"I'll jump in here and offer some suggestions for improving what you already have, rather than saying you missed the boat.  A major improvement you can make to your resume is to highlight what impact you had at each role.  Think of things that are quantifiable.  You want the person reading your resume--who will ultimately have to defend his/her decision to offer you an interview--to have some positive factoids about you that can be brought up.    For instance, ""This person jpark170 doesn't have much Chem Eng experience, but saved the Deli $X,000 by identifying process inefficiencies, that's the type of thing we're looking for at Cyberdyne.""    Your current resume only highlights your ""to-do"" list, as IowaStateGuy noted--nobody cares about a ""to-do"" list. They care about the difference you made."

See if you can use that Korean or Japanese to leverage a starting position as an engineering translator or a sales engineer with a US/East Asian company.

You're in a pretty bad spot, and there are thousands of chemical engineers graduating every semester that are more deserving of a job than you (sorry to be blunt, but it's true).   Fix your attitude/mentality- If someone said that to me I would thank them for their input, but I would do my best to make them eat their words. People have received jobs in the position you were in, but have worked really hard to get them. If you don't have confidence that you're capable of getting the job, then why would anyone be convinced to take the chance on you. Go get your resume critiqued by many people. If they are saying it's nice the way it is then they don't know squat. Find someone that is willing to drill you on all the flaws. Writing a really good resume should take a large amount of time. I've re-written mine about 30 times when I was looking for my first job, but I received a ton of interviews because I took the time & effort on it. Find some job that's useful. Be a tutor, help out with chemical engineering classes, do something that shows you're capable of using your brain. If I had to choose between a cook or a guy volunteering to teach calculus, I will very easily choose the guy teaching calculus. Go to your college career fairs, attend the informational sessions, and make sure every recruiter knows you. A lot of hirings are done based off personal preference. If you made an impact and they like you they are willing to risk it and give you a shot. Take a temp job being some lab tech at a large company. Make sure you make friends with everyone there, and once your contract is up you can ask about open positions. Since they know you they will be able to look past your previous issues and decide based on how good you do in the temp job. I know a couple of people that ended up going this path and got jobs at the end."
ChemicalEngineering,3aovnj,DeLaSalleJoaquin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:40:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry for bit depressing and hostile response. I know you are trying to help me, but as I explained in other replies, that my brother has been doing some...very rude and annoying things about how I'm not successful at finding jobs.   But I think ""deserving"" part can be argued. I have excellent work ethics and I've exceeded the expectations of managers, professors, and club administrators in project and managing every single time. I believe that what I missed during college is the opportunities acquire internships or co-ops to show that as a statement.   Maybe more ""qualified"" might be a better word than ""deserving"" in my opinion. It's not as hostile and blunt as ""deserving,"" but it delivers a point."
ChemicalEngineering,3aovnj,thekid2009,5,Mon Jun 22 23:24:12 2015 UTC,"I think you're getting over-sensitive instead of grasping what I'm saying. Whether I say qualified, or deserving really should mean nothing to you. The fact is your competition is outperforming you. This is from a person that doesn't know you and basing it off solely on your resume. Keep in mind just about every place you apply to will not know you at all and will only have that to judge. If I see a subpar GPA vs a great GPA, no activities vs a person with plenty of activities, then yes, I would consider the 2nd person more deserving, qualified, what have you over the first.  Hiring managers see tons of resumes every hiring season, so they will be picky. Any excuse to put you one less than someone they will do it.   Edit: and let me be frank. Stop with the pity party.  No one likes a pity party. You made the choices you made, you live with it, and you move on. Stating that you feel miserable does not help you in any way shape or form.

I made a stupid choice in my Freshman year, which was to cram in Thermodynamics, Transport Phenomena, and Diff eq in all one semester. (This was possible due to tons of AP credits I had) I did terribly, so the GPA suffered.  C. At my senior year, in two of my project classes, my partners got bunch of offers. They decided to ditch school and did bare minimum so they just won't fail. I pulled it through, but because of ""it should be group effort"" bs I got B on both courses. (EX: During presentation, they showed up during last 10 minute of session so they won't be ""no-show."" Or they gave me horrible looking poster and said it was done. I ended up learning how to use indesign and CAD within 12 hours and pulled everything through) D. Also at my senior year, I stupidly took 600 level courses for two semester. I was the only undergrad student in the class. Professor (who was department chair) really liked me and I met my parent's friend's son pursuing PhD in Env. Engineering, who immediately became good friend, but I only did average in that course.  E. I said I have excellent work ethics. Academic ethics wise....I'm okay, but not excellent.

Newsflash guys, its not just a bunch of disgruntled people venting. ChemE is a stagnant field and its not going to get better anytime soon.  No internship. Honestly, the 2.93 GPA wouldn't have disqualified you from internships. You could have gotten an internship at a small company or at any number of the companies that dont give a shit about GPA. ""but but but extracurriculars."" 90 percent of EC's = bullshit and exaggeration. ""Gee, I sit in AiCHE meetings and eat pizza, look how involved I am guys!"" You should have just bullshitted something for the sake of getting an internship. Btw, as an aside, you went to Hopkins, which is known for its harsh curve and bright student body. The level of academic rigor in state schools doesn't even compare. I graduated from Michigan with a 3.5 and that's considered ""magna cum laude"" LMAO.   I disagree with the comments saying to take off your projects on your resume. Keep them on, because you don't have anything else that demonstrates ENGINEERING RELEVANCE. A lot of companies don't even give a shit about ur GPA. I wouldn't even list it. You just have to keep spamming applications and ""networking"" events. Also, broaden your search to include business, mechE and chemist positions. Most people think ChemE and chemistry are the same fkn thing. Do a stint in a chem lab and transition out. Also, where are you located? You have to be willing to relocate for cross country positions. Positions in the middle of nowhere would be easier to get than ones in the urban areas. You would sacrifice quality of life for employment but I feel like that would be a necessary tradeoff.  I sympathize and empathize with you at the same time, having been in your shoes before.

At the very least it can get you into engineering work if you can gain some broader engineering skills from it.

Sorry if I'm leaking too much /r/AsianAmerican here but I don't want you to discount this opportunity if it can be something that really changes your life for the better. I'd love to have more discussions about race with you though since you seem to be self stereotyping a lot. Your brother just sounds like a jerk, not Asian.   As a disclaimer, I've never joined the military so I can't really tell you about NUPOC. It seems to be a programmed for the more scientifically inclined who want to serve though. I researched into the Naval Reactors program which seems like it's the hardest to get into (need high GPA from a top school) but there are other programs too that are also technical. Not all the programs require you to be in a submarine for months either.   But you should also change your resume, a lot. Especially for those automated online applicant tracking system computers. If you can't shoehorn any words from the job description into your resume then you should reconsider why you're even sending it in. Even if it means changing the wording of your resume for every job, do it. You probably won't have to do that if you focus on a few industries and roles at a time though. You might not be getting anything except from the few smaller companies that actually have humans reading every resume. I've only found like two of these companies and that was on accident, so if anyone has any tips on finding small companies I would appreciate it too.   Good luck, brother."

I have an ME in ChemE (undergrad in math) and just took another analyst position in pharma after applying for 50+ jobs (that uses my master's work).   I'm not sure how dense the field is in other parts of the country, but there are a bunch here. My undergrad GPA was 3.2 and my graduate 3.4. I will say be careful what you wish for. Pharma and biotech are wrapped extremely tight in red tape. The reason I like an analyst position over an engineering in this field is that you don't have to jump through all the GMP hoops that those guys do (although starting out I probably would have made 5-10K more a year). Change is very slow, and innovative ideas are generally not given a fair shot.

Some schools have staff dedicated departments than only handle co-ops and internships. If your school doesn't have one, just means a little more work on your end. Then, it's like looking for a job.   Big companies have specific pages dedicated to internships o. Their career pages. Look for those. Do your homework and look for companies in the area. Looking for something specific? Don't be afraid to travel. Internships provide relocation assistance sometimes.  Lastly, if you can't get a job, work in a lab for the summer. Most professors can't get you some money and the experience is still very good.  Actually, one more thing. Go on interviews with your career center.

For instance:   I know someone that is in consulting as an entry level and started out at 65k in Minnesota Another chemical engineer in Houston works for oil and started out at 89k   I myself started at 60k (forgot I had a different job right out of college), after two years experience I'm in the 90's. In all reality salaries shouldn't be the main goal here. I could make more working somewhere else, but I could get stuck with a shitty work/life balance, a bad manager, and all that crap. Keep in mind all those play a role in taking the positions they are in. At the end of the day I only work 40 hours, in a plant that has a great culture, and everything is so relaxed that I wouldn't even think about switching jobs for unless it's a 30% raise. I make more than enough to live within my means."

First time my company was in financial troubles so I had to leave, I love the job and the people there but I didn't have a choice. It was a food manufacturing plant and a small company, so that's why I had lower pay  Second company I worked for was a much larger corporation in the refinery business. I had a decent pay bump there and showed that I was worth something so I got raises 6 months in. The work/life balance was so skewed though that I got sick of it. It was a rough environment with shitty management that I was willing to quit without finding a job than work there another year.  Third place is where I'm at now. It's a smaller company in a specialty chemicals field. I make less than if I worked somewhere else, but it offered a better work/life balance. The pay is still decent and I have time to spend it! Definitely a huge plus.  Unless something extremely worthwhile comes along I'll be happy here. Like I said it depends on what people are willing to do to get that extra cash.

ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,annamollyx,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:02:22 2015 UTC,"At my school, you go meet employers/recruiters face-to-face at the career fair and if you impress them or if you are a go-getter like you mention and ask about internship opportunities, you can often sign up for interviews at the career fair. Otherwise, some recruiters will just ask for resumes, and instruct you to apply at their website, and will call back. Depends on the company."
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,flche123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:25:13 2015 UTC,probably mock interviews with recruiters? my school had a few of those events.
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,dimpledballs,3,Fri Jun 19 08:24:15 2015 UTC,http://www.coop.gatech.edu/about_us.html  It's not really a mock interview. It's the interview that leads to an internship. They just have a single week that the companies are allowed interview students.
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,Coolbeans224,4,Fri Jun 19 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with all your points. I started cheme with really no idea at all the kinds of jobs you could get with it. Thankfully it turns out you can go into almost any field as a cheme. If you distinguish yourself that is. I had a 3.9 gpa with 2 majors and I almost didn't have a job upon graduation. This is because I didn't have any internships and thus no relevant experience. I also was straight up horrible at networking and never ever put myself out of my comfort zone. So by March of senior year the situation was getting dire. My gpa is amazing, my extra curriculars are tops why am I not getting any interviews despite the hundreds of resumes I've sent out via websites?? Once I started working I realized that most likely no one was even reading my resumes (pro tip put exact words and phrases from the job description in your resume. And yes that means change your resume for every job you apply to!!) Anyway I did get a job by graduation through a school career fair I.e. I met the hiring manager face to face and they called me back. I interview well and once someone actually looked at my resume they liked me and hired me. This was only for 49k though in a high cost of living city. I was so scared I wouldn't get anything else that I just took it and lived with my parents. I learned a ton there but a select few made it hard to stay. I applied again after about a year and all of a sudden everywhere wanted me! Recruiters were after me like crazy now that I had real experience. I took a job at 65k and got promoted to 75k a year later. So in conclusion, get an internship asap, network even though it sucks and once you do the arduous work of getting an entry level position it should be easy to get the next. Remember if you don't like the results then you have to change your method. Applying to more faceless jobs the same way isn't going to get you anywhere. Don't give up!!"
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,CarelessPotato,5,Fri Jun 19 03:08:41 2015 UTC,"Just to add to this, I spent most of my junior and senior years being anxious about getting a job. I had no internships, no coops, a 3.3 GPA, no extracurriculars except AIChE,  and thought I would never find a job. The best advice I got was to treat searching for a job like a major course for both semesters of senior year.   Tailored resume and cover letter for each and every position you apply to is essential. Going to your school's career fairs is also essential. The last semester of my senior year, I received two job offers from companies I found at the career fair. One was a low ball offer, but the other was average starting so I accepted that.   Just don't give up. It can be very hard, and I know people who did better than me in school that are still looking for jobs. But stay calm and confident, apply to every apprentice/associate job you can find, and follow up."
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,Kev-bot,2,Fri Jun 19 03:34:52 2015 UTC,Great advice! This is the kind of persistence and intentional action that is needed in today's college recruitment setup. Companies aren't just coming for top gpa's. It is almost a full time job to look for a job.
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,vingnote,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:29:57 2015 UTC,Do you have any additional advice? I'm pretty much in your exact position.
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,lamarcus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"Is a 3.3 really that bad...? Maybe it varies by school but I'm thrilled about my 3.2, am only in 2 ECs, and landed an internship as a rising junior. It might vary per school but I've been told you can still get a job with a 2.7."
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,StonBurner,3,Sun Jun 21 12:18:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you touched on it (only got about halfway through your text) but this is something VERY important that anyone considering getting into ChemE needs to consider:  Chemical Engineering (especially EIT and junior positions) is one of the highest mobility needed engineering disciplines. Being able to move to different cities, even across the country or in other ones, as well as remote areas, is very common. Also, having to do a lot of travel in your work is extremely common as well. Being tied down with family, friends, not willing to move, etc is something to consider"
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,vingnote,3,Fri Jun 19 03:50:31 2015 UTC,"didn't mention it, but you are making a great point...I didn't realize this until late in the game. Schools need to make a better point of telling kids you will likely have to move to a rural area."
ChemicalEngineering,3ad0er,WilliamLooby,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:27:52 2015 UTC,Did you actually include your extra-curriculars on your resume? I almost never see extra-curriculars on resumes on /r/resumes.
ChemicalEngineering,3adfnk,Superchair,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:28:18 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the company.  Where I work, our production planner is a younger engineer who started off in our R&D department. He doesn't just set the schedule, he is also our liason to the customers and does a lot of capacity analysis and financial forecasts.  He definitely spends more time with the CEOs than any of us who are involved with the nuts and bolts of things, which tends to give you some great mentors and network contacts and fast track promotions. He will likely be the Plant Controller in a few years."

ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,TheBloodIsRed,-3,Fri Jun 19 04:07:54 2015 UTC,Let's not be biased here. Companies hiring entry level engineers are at an all-time high.
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,IowaStateGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"Then let's assess the parameter that actually matters... the ratio of the number of new grads to the number of entry level jobs available.   My rough assessment (based on job market data and the growing number of graduates from my university) says that ratio is getting larger and larger, resulting in an increasingly bleaker outlook for ChemE grads. As in, it's probably not a good career choice if you're in the bottom 50% of students."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,curious95,4,Sun Jun 21 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Rough assessment on what? You're pulling all that crap out of your ass. People are retiring as mass rates in the next 5 years, there is very little mid level engineers that are considered decent, and chemical plants are in a massive expansion right now. If you didn't get a job then you're an outlier. You may not be one on this sub, but overall they are still hiring in bulk. The people that don't get jobs don't get them for a reason. Either they sucked in school, sucked in networking, or companies don't feel they are capable to handle the job.  Are there a lot of chemical engineer undergrads right now? Well yeah, it's one of the highest paying job so people will flock to it. Take a look at what happened to pharmacy school. Does that mean there isn't a huge demand for them? No. If you are worth a damn you will get hired. It's like any other job."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,IowaStateGuy,2,Sun Jun 21 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"Supply estimate:  http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/chemical-engineers.htm  Demand estimate:  76% growth in annual new grads from 2006 to 2014 (mentioned by another commenter in this thread, and still less than the growth in the ChemE department at my alma mater).   And for the record, I was one of the ""successful"" minority from my school who got a well-paying eng job in the city I want to live in. Granted, I'm not totally happy with it, and I'm not successful enough that I could easily switch. I post here because I know tons of smart and hard-working people who did not. Had they studied CS instead, their lives would be much better right now."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,curious95,2,Sun Jun 21 21:18:12 2015 UTC,The grass is always greener. I'm just saying. I know a few CS friends that took a while to find jobs as well.
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,IowaStateGuy,2,Sun Jun 21 21:25:23 2015 UTC,Nope. The data shows that grass actually is greener in the CS job markets right now.   The bottom 50% of CS graduates are doing much better than the bottom 50% of ChemE graduates. The prospects at the top are probably better as well (on average).   Salary charts will reflect this as soon as we're past the time-delay of these trends.
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,curious95,2,Sun Jun 21 21:31:13 2015 UTC,"I meant that as a statement that you will always have people complain about one major and be better off going to another, just like you are doing now. Frankly a large portion of chemical engineers are doing entirely fine. Everyone is just freaking out on Reddit because you have the pool of people that didn't get jobs all complaining in one spot."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,IowaStateGuy,3,Sun Jun 21 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"I know ChemE can be a great career path. Like Law school (though probably not as badly), the supply/demand is becoming skewed. I think it's important to inform prospective students about the situation.   I know you say there are expected mass retirings from the older engineers but is there data to indicate this will significantly affect the overall job outlook? I ask this totally sincerely. I'm choosing my path and going forward I'm trying to be as informed as possible."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,curious95,2,Sun Jun 21 22:36:00 2015 UTC,"I don't get what data you need:   Certain areas have plants expanding at a large rate. This requires more operators, contractors, engineers, management, etc.  A lot of companies openly admitted that their mid-experienced level engineers are almost non existent and need to fill those roles. The only way to do that is to hire young and prep them before the older generation retires. Entry level salaries have increase astronomically since 2009. This includes mid-level experience salaries as well. Companies pay them not because people deserve it, but because the demand is that much higher.   You said you have a job, what do you mean about being informed? Talk to the older engineers, they will easily tell you once you get 5-10 year experience you're pretty much set salary wise. The reason is because there is none worth getting right now but are extremely needed."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,IowaStateGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:02:53 2015 UTC,"just a thought, CS salaries tend to be higher in statistics because they are concentrated in high COL areas, esp. compared to where CHE jobs are. do these data take that into account?"
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,burdlinsky,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"You might have a point there with respect to the higher end salaries. But I think we can confidently say the ""unemployment""/underemployment rate is much much higher for ChemE than for CS. So I'd think cost of living wouldn't make up for that difference (I also save most of my salary so COL differences negating higher salary is exaggerated for me)."

ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,thekid2009,2,Mon Jun 22 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe because they built a culture that uses their subreddit for a useful function other than complaining? A few months back a mod mentioned what we would like on this subreddit and I proposed that it should be more informational than having to deal with internship/job questions since we go over it so many times. Needless to say it was downvoted to hell.   Misery loves company, if one person rants and complain others will come and follow."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,IowaStateGuy,12,Mon Jun 22 02:31:26 2015 UTC,It is self-selection bias. Anyone who gloated about how they have a great offer would likely not post because of the downvotes.

I find it very hard to believe that anyone willing to relocate can't find a job.  When interviewing, make sure you have SOLID answers to the big 3 questions:  1) Tell me about yourself  2) Why do you want to work here?  3) Why should we hire you?   And when I say solid answers, I mean really fucking solid. Blow them away! You have near certainty that you will be asked these questions. Rehearse your answers.  Your answers to the questions should clearly illustrate three things:  1) You are able to do the job  2) You are excited about the job  3) You'll fit in with company culture   Besides that, rehearse answers to the ""bullshit questions.""

Many companies would rather work a man down than have to drag someone along with them. Companies want to hire people that in time can replace the people retiring. It's not like a job at McDonalds there you're hired as a cashier to be a cashier, but you're hired as an entry level to be in the leadership team down the road.  The interviews we have aren't that difficult; it's behavioral based. However, asking someone what their greatest achievement was and all they do is play video games you kind of know the answer is a generic ""well my senior design we did this""... I know right off the bat you weren't ambitious enough in school and even though you can probably do the job fine, I do not see you going anywhere father than that so they would get turned down."

The traditional ChE field isn't too big and was already sufficiently supplied at the lower level. Lots of ChEs end up in related or more general engineering rolls but most engineering graduating classes have grown too making for more competition for those positions too.  Good news is if you can get some experience things apparently get a lot better. Any shortage of experienced chemical engineers is in part due to companies not bringing in enough of the available new graduates at entry level positions."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,complexannoyance,2,Fri Jun 19 03:42:26 2015 UTC,I think companies that were hiring tons of Chem e's in the 2000s got burned by the economic downturn late in the decade.   Many are not creating new positions as rapidly as they previously did.

Those that don't come here to rant, so that is what you're seeing. My school has a 95%~ job placement for chemical engineers.  The people that found a job prepared for it early and made sure they got internships/co-ops before graduating."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,IowaStateGuy,3,Sun Jun 21 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"Do you realize your perspective is heavily biased? 95% placement rate is insane and not at all representative of national trends. I admit I'm also biased, coming from a school whose placement rate is probably ~50% in engineering related jobs, or probably 10% in actual ChemE jobs. Clearly I'm from an area where there isn't much ChemE opportunity, but this was not conveyed to us as students. Professors and advisors almost only talked about breadth of opportunities with no mention of supply/demand ratio or higher than entry level expectations.    I agree that everyone should work hard and follow the advice you suggest in your posts. But I think you are misrepresenting the industry. Computer science undeniably has a better entry level job outlook, and I think we should be making people aware."

I know I have it well off, and I will use my time to get mold my life to my liking.   My only dispute is that you seem to be from an area of ChemE plenty, and I don't think you can extrapolate your experience to the national average."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,curious95,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"Again, there have been more chemical engineering entry level positions than there ever has been. They also pay the highest. As a result, you will see more people/schools trying to get into the chemical engineering field. That in turn leads more competition. However, if you did it right you would be just fine. The field isn't getting smaller, it's just people are trying to jump on the bandwagon."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,IowaStateGuy,2,Sun Jun 21 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"So do you think the majority of students are doing it right? And do students have the ability to assess whether they're doing it right?   My opinion is no & no, based upon experience at my alma mater. And because of all the bandwagoning, you have to be solidly above average (whether that means average at a strong school, or above average at a lesser school). But most students are not solidly above average, so I think we should inform them of the situation to give them time to improve their profile or work towards other careers."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,curious95,0,Sun Jun 21 23:00:04 2015 UTC,"If you want my brutally honest opinion. A majority of chemical engineer students shouldn't be in chemical engineering. I've interviewed hundreds, and taught hundreds when I was in school, and they are have a lot of flaws that make them really hard to justify to hire them.  I honestly don't get what's so hard to see if they are doing it right, everyone tells them the same exact thing: do good in school, do extra curricular activities, and network. Yet that is ignored since it's harder to do."
ChemicalEngineering,3ac45p,IowaStateGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"Doing good in school (requires a certain aptitude, background, and discipline) and networking (requires a certain status to be noticed, and decent social skills) successfully are just not gonna be doable by everyone. I understand that's what you're saying, but I just don't think it's totally available to everyone. Also a lot of advice says that these things can be half-assed... way too many people are telling you GPA doesn't matter. That might be true in CS where you might get by on a 2.5, but the supply/demand situation for entry level ChemE means GPA matters quite a lot."
ChemicalEngineering,3abwzi,GibMirBenzene,6,Thu Jun 18 21:12:38 2015 UTC,I had two internships that were research based and not in industry. It has taken me over a year to find a job. I think I finally have one locked up.
ChemicalEngineering,3abwzi,Caladbolg2,5,Thu Jun 18 23:39:16 2015 UTC,Probably harder to get a first internship. Once you have an internship experience I'd say it makes getting a job a lot easier (but your experience may vary)

NYC has absolutely nothing; at best, you might find some financial company that would hire you for your math skills.  I think your best bet would be Boston.  It's going to be an uphill battle w/o a Masters-Doctorate, but they have a huge pharma/biochem industry so they're one of the few places that has ChemE within the city (pharma labs don't tend to burn down a city the way, say, petroleum plants do).  Boston is a cool city, definitely smaller than NYC but only ~3 hours away so seeing your brother wouldn't be too hard.  Beyond that, you're going to find most jobs are in not so exciting places, down south, and a solid plane ride from your brother."
ChemicalEngineering,3aa75e,MmmWafffles,3,Thu Jun 18 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"If you're okay with doing more R&D/bench-scale style things, at most maybe some process development (biomanufacturing should be growing here but it's not quite a hub in that regard yet), then Boston is fantastic. More than enough pharma/biotech to go around. Though yeah, not having an advanced degree or that much experience can be a handicap, but it could still be a good place to start.  Otherwise if you want more ""traditional engineering,"" you'll have to head at least towards NJ/Pennsylvania/Delaware. Which is still relatively close to New York.  The city itself will have nothing other than financial/consulting jobs, and if you really want to go to a hotspot for chemical engineering then you'd have to look into the Midwest/South."

The best you would likely do is the Philly/Newark, DE area, which is a couple hours away.  There are investment firms that hire engineers to do technology evaluation, so it's possible for you to get a job like that in NYC, but it might be tough to get them to sponsor you a work visa for what's already a 'fringe' engineering job.  If you're looking for a proper Chemical Engineering job as a foreign engineer, your best bet is going to be the Gulf Coast (Houston, Baton Rouge, etc).    Good luck!  As a non-US engineer working in the USA, it's not easy to find work, and I went to college here so I had a good network of contacts in-country already."

ChemicalEngineering,3a8ch8,teronamkho,5,Thu Jun 18 00:55:51 2015 UTC,"If you don't intend on taking the job why would even bother mentioning to the other companies? I wouldn't, even if it is your worst case scenario backup job."
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ch8,ChicagoChemE,3,Thu Jun 18 01:33:19 2015 UTC,It's because of the deadline. I understand I should probably just wait and see what happens since I am getting so may interviews but I am also getting more and more worried since I am running out of money and getting more desperate for a job. I let the company I interviewed for today know that I do have an offer but also reassured them that their company was my first choice. Is there something I can do in a thank you email to ensure that I would like to work for them over any other company?
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ch8,ChicagoChemE,4,Thu Jun 18 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"I see. Well there are two sides to this I think. Telling a company that you have a standing offer will either make you appear more valuable to them and genuinely expedite their decision, or put them off completely if the deadline is not workable for them. So basically I am saying that telling them might be polarizing either way. If I were you I would either tell them or not tell them on a case by case basis - try to take advantage of this fact... some may disagree with my but personally I would not feel bad about exploiting this. How quickly they are planning to bring a potential new hire in to actually work is critical in this situation.  As far as your question, I would basically just tell them what you just asked. The thank you email is a great opportunity to obviously not only thank them, but also to reiterate your interest in the position.  Edit: From your GPA and the fact that you've had an internship already I would be surprised if you didnt land multiple offers. Are you a US citizen?"
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ch8,ChEChicago,2,Thu Jun 18 01:48:03 2015 UTC,"Not a US citizen but a permanent resident so I don't need a visa sponsorship. I just suck at interviewing and only relied on jobs posted in my college's career center during my senior year. Now finally after starting to use Linked-In, I have been able to get more call backs and interviews."
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ax0,spongebobsilicapants,8,Thu Jun 18 00:41:43 2015 UTC,I am not sure it matters. But I can tell you that in general you are better off doing a postdoc at a different university from the one where you did your PhD.
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ax0,at_work_alt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is a commonly accepted idea. Why do I need to change schools? Is the school very important at post-doc level? Ideally, the research topic should be your golden not the school itself. But I am not sure of that too. It is another parameter to consider."
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ax0,at_work_alt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:04:18 2015 UTC,"Why do I need to change schools?   It shows that you've done research in a different environment, with different professors and facilities, presumably giving you a less provincial outlook. It allows you to meet more people and increase your network, which will improve your ability to do collaborative research in the future. It also gives those around you more connections via your larger network.  Is the school very important at post-doc level?  Absolutely. Would you rather hire a professor who did a stint at MIT or Stanford? Or some Podunk state school? The ability to get hired at a very selective school indicates that you are a good hire (very much a rich-get-richer situation, but it is what it is). You're also going to meet and work with much more highly regarded researchers at better schools. You will have access to more funding, better undergraduate and graduate researchers, and better equipment."
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ax0,Rostin,3,Fri Jun 19 12:56:51 2015 UTC,"I guess if it were me, I'd choose a different topic. Two reasons. First, it shows you are capable of changing topics. Second, it exposes you to a new field and a new way of thinking.  However, I skipped from PhD to staff position without a post-doc and I don't do much research anymore, so take that advice with a grain of salt."
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ax0,Panda_Muffins,2,Thu Jun 18 18:53:31 2015 UTC,"I asked this very question to numerous chemical engineering professors at MIT, Princeton, UC Berkeley, and the University of Illinois. I'm pretty sure every single one suggested to do your postdoc in a related but different topic than what you did your PhD in. Quite a number of the professors ended up actually being hired because of this new skillset/area of research. Others simply thought it was valuable to get new insight, unless you are truly extremely passionate about your PhD topic. I don't think you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you stayed in the same topic, but it will likely only help you if you switch topics. To get an idea for yourself, I'd ask professors in your department for their input since they all likely did post-docs as well. I'm only just about to be a first-year graduate student, but I was curious about this question when I went on graduate school visiting weekends and so I asked around."
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ax0,Panda_Muffins,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:23:12 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. This is very informative. I am not crazy about my Ph.D topic and during my study I also worked in different projects that were completely unrelated from my thesis. The thing that I am not sure of is that is it better to be an expert in one area or know something little about lots of things. I think this is my actual concern.
ChemicalEngineering,3a8ax0,Panda_Muffins,2,Thu Jun 18 22:33:18 2015 UTC,"Considering it's in the same lab, I'm sure the other options aren't too far removed from your PhD field, right? If you are not crazy about your PhD topic, then switching topics seems wise. All the professors I spoke to seemed to think this gave them additional skills. Some professors even had pretty drastic switches, which they then ended up pursuing further in their own careers.   I'm not sure if you're interested in going into academia, but I remember one of the professor's comments in particular. He said that if you continue doing the same thing for your postdoc as your PhD, you may have a harder time distinguishing your own proposed research from your PhD adviser's if you decide to become a professor. Obviously your PhD adviser is well-established in his/her field, and so if you don't have enough background in other topics to distinguish yourself from your PhD adviser's work, your PhD adviser will likely win every grant and will just always outshine you. So, having that new viewpoint is useful for coming up with new ideas.   All that being said, I wouldn't worry too much if you want to pursue any of the other topics! It's always about how you sell yourself in the end. You can now be a master of multiple trades, and if you sell yourself in that fashion, it can make you stand out!"

Pressure drop calculated for the capacity of the PSV at worst case relieving conditions should not exceed 3% of the PSV set pressure to avoid chattering and destroying the PSV during a relief event.  PSV inlet lines can be difficult to design for the 3% rules in some installations due to geometry, process needs, etc..  Mistakenly calculating pressure drop with long radius elbows when the installation is actually short radius will result in an erroneously low pressure drop in this safety critical application.  I would suggest you look at Crane Technical Paper 410 that discusses the pressure drop calculations and K values for SR and LR elbows.   This will provide the fundamental basis for the calculations of your spreadsheet (likely).

Your risk of exposure will depend on the type of job you do and the company. There are obviously some companies that ignore certain regulations, but overall I have never been afraid to be in a chemical plant. There are also jobs you can do as a chemical engineer that will limit the time you are around the process.   I currently work in a plant where the building my office is located in is 50 feet away from the process, but I am not concerned. We have a GC that pulls air samples from the building and we have never had a reading on it. You're more likely to be injured by being in the unit and not paying attention to something than being over exposed to chemicals. Actually, you're more likely to be injured in a car accident on the way to work than being over exposed to chemicals."
ChemicalEngineering,3a109x,Bafflepitch,2,Tue Jun 16 19:46:16 2015 UTC,You actually have people who run atmospheric air through a GC? That's probably the most responsible thing I've ever heard in my life .
ChemicalEngineering,3a109x,Bafflepitch,2,Tue Jun 16 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"We have multiple systems and they are automatic.  We have continuous air monitors all over that reports the % concentration of a range of compounds. I wasn't involved with this project much other than the DCS side, and don't know what all it measures besides methane. Each sensor reports the concentrations back frequently but it won't report the small ppm leak (<10 ppm). It is meant to immediately alert us to a large leak (pipe / flange blows out, etc.) that could exceed the LEL.  For the small leaks we have the automatic GC systems (There are multiple ones). There is a network of vacuum tubes throughout the unit that pull atmospheric air samples on a cycle and they are automatically run through the GC. This obviously polls slower than the above system, but we can get very small readings that will help us catch leaks very early. We also have the same type of equipment on different process gas streams.   Edit: I always thought these were neat. If I was in charge of our tank farm I would try to get them: Air monitoring with lasers. http://neomonitors.com/products/lasergas-ii-op/"

ChemicalEngineering,3a1byq,MmmWafffles,6,Tue Jun 16 13:31:39 2015 UTC,"Not to sound condescending but... If you think that your contact circle is the problem, isn't it your job to fix that? What about your friends from school? Also, What's stopping you from walking/driving over to the production facility to say hi?  Take all this with a grain of salt, because what would I know anyways? I'm just a stranger on the internet. What's next is all up to you, live your life how you want to live it. If you don't like your job, find another one. Why should you care about what your bosses think? Think he'll be mad when you become the next senior engineer 7 years down the road? Think he'll be mad if you stay at your position 7 years down the road? Think he'll be mad if you're making $100k a year? What about $35k? POINT BEING Why do you care what he thinks?  ""Where should I look?"" How about a career fair? How about just walking into offices and asking for someone to read your resume and if they have positions open. What are you doing to get yourself noticed by these companies?  I can't say anything too positive on linkedin (Not a big fan, plus they make you pay to reach out to people who aren't within 3 degrees of your connections)  Head hunters only look for people they can pitch to their hiring managers, same with recruiters which implies you should have skills worthy of selling. (Team player, natural leadership, hard worker, problem solver, etc etc don't count)   Window closing....meh. I went from food manufacturing($35k), to pharmaceuticals($45K), to finally energy($80K) (Controls and gas turbines, a job that was supposedly for MEs and EEs) And I graduated the same time as you. So no, I don't think the window is closing.  Yes I understand you're depressed about your situation but aren't we all? It's your job to change it. You've already identified plenty of problems you can work on. People will say what they want about picking an industry and tailoring that resume for that industry but I think they're only half right. Dude, you're trying to find a job. Beggars  can't be choosers. Tailor your resume as such. Do what you gotta do to make yourself happy and live a fulfilling engineering career.   It took me several months to figure it out how to speak to recruiters, how to dress nicely, how to write a resume, talking to HR and hiring managers, and a lot of talks with my friends and family before I figured it out what worked for me. I'm sure as I develop more skills in the field and myself as a professional, I'll learn more things to help me go beyond what I am now. So it's soley up to you OP.

I only recently got back on the application band wagon, so my questions are more ""help me avoid silly mistakes"" than ""someone give me a job so I don't need to bother looking!""    And really, your answers are helpful to that end.  It's reassuring to know that the door is open; I know I and I alone can walk through it and all that.  Tailor my resume, check.  Make a change to the job I want, working on it.  Emails are going out, and 2nd degree LinkedIn connections are getting messages, and you're definitely right about career fairs, etc.  It's also good to know about the LinkedIn 3-degree thing, and the headhunter point. The boss thing I only mention because I think I'll have to all-in on that change once I start getting interviews, I doubt I'll be able to inconspicuously take afternoons off for long.

As for resumes, Hiring managers and HR.. they're busy as it is. They don't have time for meticulous details unless that's exactly what they're looking for, and even then it's difficult to find in a resume when you only glance at it for 10-30 seconds.

I even used unpaid vacation (I was a temp for two years...no paid vacation, no paid sick time) to get time off for multiple interviews where I was flown all over the country.  I had a good working relationship with a few recruiters.  Unfortunately, chemical engineering jobs don't seem to make their way to them often, so the kind of work they'd find for me was more project than process.

ChemicalEngineering,3a0g9j,IMKR1,5,Tue Jun 16 06:50:44 2015 UTC,"The ideal situation is to make sure you work for a company that a) treats its employees with respect, and b) has enough money to pay for the resources it actually needs.  However, that's not possible for everyone, and I'm aware that laws regarding employee rights in the US are often a lot less protective or powerful than those in Europe.   Be assertive and polite from the very start, which will take some courage. If you are being pushed to work unfair hours, use compromise to establish your boundaries without appearing uncooperative. For example, if you're asked to put in 60 hours for a month when you're only contracted for 40-and-a-bit, as soon as the work starts picking up, log your hours, and speak to your boss. Say, ""I understand how important this project is, and I am putting in this much time beyond a normal working day to make sure it gets done. When the project finishes, I'd really appreciate having X days off in return, as I have to sacrifice a number of things in my home life to keep this project on track.""  Also, try and have the confidence to turn down work that is overloading you (""I don't have time to do that, so I can't in fairness say yes."") and tell your manager when more resource is needed (""This workload is too high for one person. We need to bring someone else in or we won't be able to get it done on time."")."

ChemicalEngineering,3a0g9j,claireauriga,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:18:26 2015 UTC,"I've always found that the social and interpersonal interaction side of being an engineer has been the hardest and most tiring thing to learn. I'm a great presenter, teacher and communicator, but actually building the relationships that make you more effective at work has always been a challenge for me. So I can definitely sympathize with how daunting a prospect asserting yourself in a new job can be - especially if you're working in a country where laws don't do much to address the huge power imbalance between a company and their employee.  The reason I suggest trying to assert yourself from the very start is because it's good to build a habit of respecting and valuing yourself and insisting that your company respects and values you too. Confidence in your rights will help protect you from being exploited, and when you do have to bend for pragmatic reasons you won't let them completely control your health and happiness.  It is really, really challenging. If necessary, use your inexperience as part of your assertive arsenal. Knowing your limits is part of being a good engineer, so use that to empower yourself to say things like, ""As I've only been in this role a few months, I feel I need experienced support as a safety net - I want to challenge myself but I don't want to screw up. Please can you give me less extra work so I can focus on learning how to do a good, thorough job/provide me with help from someone more experienced/give me advice on how to make sure I'm productive, rather than over-stretching myself and doing poor quality work.""  Standing up for yourself in the world of work can be difficult even for experienced engineers. And it's worth it for your own health, sanity and happiness."

This is something that you will have to feel out for yourself when you do an on site interview. Get an idea of what the company culture is as best you can.

When I first started working I thought 40 hours a week was a lot of time. I tried another job where I didn't even want to work 10 hours a week. Now, I pretty much average 45 hours a week and I'm leaving everyday with lists of things to still do. If a big project is coming up I might work 80 hours a week for a month or more.

It was expected that I would be putting in 40-50 hours a week depending on the situation. The hours you have to work depend greatly on how well your plant runs. If it runs poorly, expect to work more.   As I said I knew going in to it that I would put it more time. I felt like the money was worth it and that it was a common practice for the engineers to work longer hours. Now I'm a production superintendent and I don't put as much time in as the younger engineers. It's just part of the job. Some people make it through, some burn out. It depends where you want to end up. I definitely questioned my career choice more than once, as I did in undergrad, but I'm glad I stuck with it. I think it was worth it. My company also is paying for my MBA right now so that's an added bonus. At this point if I started hating my job and wanted to quit I don't think I'd have any trouble finding another."

It probably helps, but it isn't necessary. Despite what you may read sometimes on this sub from grad students, big companies are looking for people who proved they learned how to solve problems in grad school, as well as someone that can fit into a business culture.

You sound as if you're more interested in lecturing rather than academic research (bravo, the discipline needs more people like you), so have you ever considered getting industry experience and then going back to teach after a few years?

Desperation is the wrong attitude entirely. Value yourself highly, keep working hard, and do what you gotta do to make ends meet.

ChemicalEngineering,39zawf,CHEMengineerd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"I live in the southern california area, which I heard is one of the most competitive areas to get an internship around because many people in the country go here during the summer to intern. I'm trying to get a job in a factory or ChE place but it seems like 99% of those places have filled up with their positions though I'm hoping I'm wrong. I also have been applying to many startup companies or have been cold-calling/emailing them about internship opportunities but I've had no luck in anything so far.  I'm finding most of the opportunities online. The career center at my school is absolutely horrid for chemical engineers. With all the career fairs, the vast majority of companies are for electrical/mechanical/computer engineers. It also doesn't help that most of my professors only have connections in academia and not industry. I have gotten some opportunities for internships from my school though, but those were eaten up by my other colleagues.  Where should I go/what should I look for now?"
ChemicalEngineering,39zawf,jetfuel_steeldreams,3,Tue Jun 16 01:23:20 2015 UTC,Look in other areas. Chem E is one of the fields where you have to be able to be mobile.

It's a good job with good pay and benefits, most of the people I work with aren't idiots and seem to care about the quality of their work and our products. I use some of what I  learned in school, but rely mainly on experience and problem solving skills. There is room to be promoted and the company is in the black and stable.

We do a wide range of things, but mostly it's getting a refinery process working from start to finish (inspecting vessels/piping, going over P&IDs with the field to see what doesn't match, ensuring start up processes go correctly, getting products on spec) It's got a wide range of experiences that you're introduced to, and luckily for people who get bored quickly you change up your work frequently enough. It can get pretty exhausting, learning new processes and working odd hours, being away from family and friends for months at a time, but overall I wouldn't change anything about what I do. I've gotten to see not only the more rare side of processes (shut down, start up, loadings) but I've also gotten to see parts of the world (Korea, Netherlands, Thailand, China, Japan, Italy, all in 1 year)."

It's hard to find entry level work pretty much everywhere and you got really unlucky since 6 months experience is kind of toxic since it's enough to make you not a direct graduate hire but not enough to really count for anything.

ChemicalEngineering,39sbkm,ComicalAli,4,Sun Jun 14 11:25:35 2015 UTC,Don't take a job in the Gas industry - it isn't the same as the oil and gas where you have a number of delightfully intricate operations to get the product you want.   I thought the role would draw more closely from areas studied during uni but it hasn't - they want me to learn to use AutoCAD for draughting purposes and theory behind mechanics (bending moments etc).   I've no issue learning them but the fact there has been so little ChemE emphasis or discussion towards developing as a process engineer worries me. I've yet to discover a process engineer working in the Gas industry as well so to at least listen to their experiences.   That is just my experience since graduating though. Plenty of other engineers will paint a prettier picture.

Even that one is temporary, they probably won't keep me longer than 6 months.  It sucks, and there are days when I get really frustrated and so damn angry. My friends in other fields of engineering are doing well, as are the finance and med graduates.  Everyone said ChemE is one of the best degrees one can do for future employment prospects and job stability. Now that we've graduated, everyone is saying that the entry level market is tough to get past but will get better after. There's always something.  I'm just tired of waiting. It's really hard to stay optimistic when everyone you've started with are really happy and successful. I love chemical engineering and I would honestly take a big pay cut just for cheme work.

You're still in a phase of your career where your gpa still matters and a 2.7 isn't very great. So, playing devils advocate, you're selling a 2.7 gpa with only a few months of work experience. The upstream market is terrible right now but downstream is doing great (I just graduated and got a job downstream a few months before I finished). But, you could also look outside of oil & gas because everyone else is still hiring new grads, I've been contacted by recruiters on LinkedIn weekly for the past month. If all you're doing is applying online then you're not doing enough.

These companies were so small that they may not have a website and may not know that they have workloads that could be alleviated by another hand. It's a shot in the dark, but you are applying for a job that's not even open and now you have an employees email who works directly with the boss.  Look, you are going to have to be creative. Go to career fairs. Email people randomly. Broaden your network.   Also, I don't know who you talk to, but any time you email or talk to anybody, thank them explicitly two days later in a separate email. It shows up as a new message in their inbox, your name right there reminding them that ""oh, this job just opened and he seems nice.""

Luckily I earn a halfway decent living these days, but I've spent a fair share of my life unemployed, which, I have to say, if you can hack it materially and psychologically, is not always the worst thing... it can be motivating as hell and also give you time to think about what you want.

ChemicalEngineering,39o1mz,Loginwars,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"Thermodynamics says energy can transferred between two systems either by the event of heat or the exertion of work (considering no exchange of mass). The fundamental difference between the two is that heat happens in the microscopical/molecular level and doesn't impact the system's net momentum while work requires the appliance of a force, so net momentum transfer takes place along the energy transfer.  So mathematically, the first law of thermodynamics answers your question, as it states:  Energy transferred = Energy accumulated = Heat transferred + Work done  So the difference between the two is literally work."

I would try using a design spec in aspen plus or an adjust block in hysys to set some results by changing upstream parameters.  In terms of just making a flowsheet, I often see people not using some really simple, yet very effective blocks like the balance block and transfer blocks which make setting up purge / makeup streams much easier."

Let's get a bit more mathy with part two:  You need to perform an energy balance. The air with more humidity will have a greater effect due to a higher energy/thermal density than perfectly dry air.

All professors run their lab differently, and it might be worthwhile to find someone who you think you'll work well with.    Also, the longer you're in chemical engineering, the more you'll find that research is very different from traditional chemical engineering.  There are a lot of different research opportunities in chemical engineering, and there can be a lot of overlap between other disciplines.  That's just a product of how the field has evolved in academia."
ChemicalEngineering,39hvgh,tbc31cc,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:27:49 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in it, go for it. It does not sound unrelated to ChemE (especially within a research setting), and you will likely learn a lot about research in general as well as a variety of wet-lab techniques that can become valuable in your future. Really, do what you're interested in because this is perhaps the only time of your life where there's absolutely no detriment to trying out something and switching (or staying).   The wet-lab skills you'll likely learn in this lab will be quite valuable for career-related purposes, I'm sure. If you're thinking of doing a PhD, research experience is pretty much a requirement, so this would be a good step too."
ChemicalEngineering,39hewd,throwawaylocmunny,7,Thu Jun 11 19:00:38 2015 UTC,"This might be unpopular but I would go with the low paying job for now. A 6 year contract in a foreign country would be miserable, even with a lot of money. I worked as a petroleum engineer in a rural setting and while it was only for 6 months, I hated it. I didn't have a contract (thank goodness) and I was open to experiencing a different type of life, but as a single college graduate, it was horrible for my well being. Take the low paying one and look for better ones on the side. Stay for a year then move on. It's your life and you have the choice to NOT spend the best years of your life in somewhere desolate. Good luck"
ChemicalEngineering,39hewd,miss_engineer,3,Thu Jun 11 22:25:40 2015 UTC,"Seconded.

Any way, you really haven't given enough information for a bunch of internet strangers to decide, but I'd rather do my year or two at the $95k and then try to move on somewhere more ""fun"". You have to keep in mind what you want to do too, because there's probably no way in hell the job descriptions for these two jobs are anywhere near similar unless the $95k job is on the moon."

I had one offer after I graduated. It was for a job at a chemical plant located on the outskirts of a town of 12,000. The ""big city"" in the area was an hour away and it had a population of less than 100,000.  The job was fun in a lot of ways. I had a lot of freedom to work on what I wanted, and there was good variety. I repaired lab equipment, programmed PLCs and DCSs, did process engineering, a little design work, pilot scale experiments, and so on. One time I set up a security camera to catch an operator who was stealing from an office. But I was miserably lonely and unhappy outside of work. There were a few young people there, but in towns like that, most people with any ambition or intelligence get the hell out once they finish high school. After about 3.5 years, I did the same and went to graduate school.  Some people say they don't regret bad decisions or bad circumstances from their pasts. I have never achieved that kind of serenity about living in that town. Fifteen years on I still consider it basically meaningless suffering, a void that swallowed up my early 20s, and I wish I had just gone directly to grad school.  My bottom line advice to you is not to go to China. And that's my advice almost regardless of the career consequences of taking the lower paying job. Six years is just too much. And anyway, what happens after that? How will being stranded on the other side of the world for your first job affect your career?  The one exception is if you happen to be married. If you have someone else there to experience it with and keep you from going crazy from loneliness, then it could work."

ChemicalEngineering,39h620,Not-a_hobbit,2,Thu Jun 11 18:09:00 2015 UTC,I haven't heard the term conservent before.  Is this a PVRV type valve?  API 2000 is the code for atmospheric tank venting.  It has equations for calculating the venting requirements for inflow and outflow and also provides equations for thermal venting requirements.  For sizing the vent you can go to a manufacturer like Enardo who will provide a sizing program so you can pick the proper vent valve.
ChemicalEngineering,39h620,17399371,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:05:32 2015 UTC,"awesome, thanks man.  conservent = https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=conservation%20vent"
ChemicalEngineering,39h620,Dynamite_Fools,2,Thu Jun 11 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"Is this an atmospheric vessel? Generally conservation vents are not supposed to be used routinely. They are a safety measure, not a process instrument like a valve. If you routinely are popping open the vent, that means you don't have adequate vapor equalization.  What is in the vessel? Where do you want to push the vapors to when the vent is not opening? Where does the vent go after it's been popped?   Assuming it's a hazardous material otherwise it would be an open-top tank, usually any vapors generated via filling are scrubbed, condensed and dealt with, or otherwise cleaned before being vented to the atmosphere. If you have multiple vessels, you can pipe it up to a flare of some sort.  To actually calculate a vapor outflow line, you know your max fill rate. Calculate your pressure drop from the tank to wherever the vapor outflow line ends. Make sure that your pressure drop + outlet pressure is less than your vent pop rating. That way you can't possible build up enough pressure in the vessel to pop the vent unless there is an upset."
ChemicalEngineering,39eems,rugbyslut2,8,Thu Jun 11 04:33:22 2015 UTC,"Unknown, and to be honest the difference between the 7th and the 8th was minimal and mostly an update due to errors in the text. As of 2012, only 3 errors are reported in the text.   Somethings to consider:  1) The older versions of Perry's Handbook have some hard and fast rules of thumb for kinetics, fluids and heat transfer. These are absent in the newer additions due to the advent of CFD and CAE. I prefer having those rules of thumbs because you don't always have a process simulator at your disposal.   2) I've worked upstream, midstream and downstream petroleum. By far one of the most useful handbooks I own is the GPSA Enginering Databook:  https://gpsa.gpaglobal.org/gpsa-databook  If you're going to be a plant engineer or a field engineer, it's indispensable because it allows for quick and rough, yet accurate calculations when you have to give operations an answer in minutes instead of hours.   3) Regardless of what industry you are going to work in, pumps will be a part of your life. My goto is the Alfa Laval Pump Handbook:  https://www.google.com/#q=alfa+laval+pump+handbook  I typical spec out horizontal-multistage pumps and I'm partial to Schlumberger's REDA HPS units due to the fat they were originally downhole pumps in oil wells and as such they can handle stupid large solids, so you can get away with a strainer/sieve instead of a full blown filter.

This month I will start working with a company that researches genetically modified bacteria for the production of hydrocarbon fuels.   The first question you need to ask yourself is, do you want to be a engineer. While you will use your your knowledge of chemistry or bio, the classes you could potentially be taking rely heavily on engineering principles (duh, I know). Some bio/chem majors I know in college were really turned off at the thought of having to take more math. I'm not sure how you feel about one or two more math classes, but it might be necessary.  I'm a ChemE and I will be working in a heavily bio related environment. I have no experience with bio nor have I even taken one class in college. While just a bio degree potentially limits your options, having engineer attached to your title will possibly open other opportunities. You can work with biology but I think having a ChemE degree kind of gives you a safety net to work in other industries if need be.   Feel free to ask questions."
ChemicalEngineering,38znpi,dermoosck,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:46:27 2015 UTC,"Right.  I've only taken Calculus I up until now -- one of my summer projects was to leaf through my old textbook and see if this is something I can handle.  In theory I think it is, but obviously thinking I can handle the math and actually being able to handle it are entirely different things ;)  The thing is that my entire college career has been marked by me discovering that I really enjoy things I never thought I'd like.  In high school, I HATED math and science.  I entered college as a liberal arts major.  Now that I've grown up and settled in my interests, I love science, and after taking some science classes that required light mathematics, I don't find math entirely repulsive anymore.  But yeah, that was kind of the idea.  I already know I'm limited with my biology -- most of the bio majors at my school are either pre-med/other health profession or really in love with academia and research. I like biology well enough, but I don't fall in either of those camps.  I figured picking up a related engineering degree would open more doors, supply me with a wider set of skills (math and some programming, most notably) and, like you said, be a sort of safety net for other jobs, but I guess the issue is I don't really know what I would be getting into/how related ChemE would be to my interest in biology/if this is even a good idea/if I'm doing this for all the wrong reasons.  I made an appointment to talk to my advisor about it for next week.  The engineering program at my school is very structured and I feel like it would be hard to get into, anyway, but if I'm going to go back to school, I'd rather do it when I'm younger.  If you don't mind my asking, what initially attracted you to ChemE and how did you end up landing a job in a bio-related career?  Did you have any job experience while you were still in school?  And thanks for taking the time to answer!  It's been really helpful."
ChemicalEngineering,38znpi,dermoosck,2,Mon Jun 8 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delayed response. What attracted me to chemical engineering at first was an interest in chemistry. As a junior in high school I knew I liked chemistry and science in general. But I wanted more than research or lab work (which you can also do with ChemE). I took a trip to the college I would eventually go to and discovered what chemical engineering was. I realized I didn't like chemistry as much as I like engineering sciences. My first year I wasn't sure if ChemE was what I wanted but as I proceed I really liked the diversity of the degree.   The only relative job experience I had as an undergraduate was research. I was fortunate enough to be on a research team for a little over a year. My work was mostly on membranes and hollow fiber membranes. I strongly believe this experience is what got me my job. Not specifically the my membrane knowledge, but my ""engineering"" experience I guess. I have experience with assembling and designing a hollow fiber spinning process.   I kinda disagree with IAmA_Guy. While it seems like all industries are struggling, ChemE's have many options which results in several job options. I have friends working for breweries, making cheese, membranes, doing metallurgy,  research for national labs, explosives, etc. I wanna say most of my friends have graduated with jobs. Yes, some places have a limited industry where ChemE's can work. But I feel that is the same for any degree/field. The state that I live in have a very small industry and it difficult to get into the national labs with out a mater's degree or higher. To make sure I got a job I became very active in my school and department. I had the option to go out of state but I limited myself because I wanted to stay close to my family."
ChemicalEngineering,38znpi,odh_moyer,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this response! One of the big reasons I was considering tacking on engineering to dual-major is because it would open up more doors since I'd have more skills and experience (math, programming, and engineering in addition to my life science and lab skills).  There aren't a huge amount of jobs available to me with just my B.S. in biology, and I feel like an engineering degree would only help me, and at the very, very worst leave me no worse off than I was before.  Except a little poorer, but I'll end up back at school no matter what, whether it's for engineering or for a MS or PhD in life science, and I think it's worth it if it increases the odds of me landing a career in biotechnology or tissue engineering.  Did you get your job straight out of undergrad or did you go back to school for a masters?"
ChemicalEngineering,38znpi,IAmA_Guy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"At my school, if you have only taken calc 1 it will take you 4 years to go through the sequential course work required for ChemE. In fact, the curriculum presumes that you will start 1st semester with calc 2."
ChemicalEngineering,38znpi,gdt1320,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"Right.  That's one reason I'm meeting with my advisor -- to see if this is even feasible.  I've actually taken a decent amount of the classes required for the major since there was a great amount of overlap with my biology course-load.  The ones left are pretty much just math classes and engineering courses.  It's still probably at least two years, though.  I actually just discovered that we have a biological engineering degree (it was lumped in with agricultural engineering).  I will definitely also bring that up to my advisor to see if it might be easier to complete and still leave me well-prepared.  Unfortunately I feel like the general consensus is that minor engineering degrees like biological engineering aren't in high-demand."
ChemicalEngineering,38znpi,gdt1320,3,Mon Jun 8 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"Make sure you're realistic about job prospects in the area you're wanting to work. The job market for chemical engineers is small.

ChemicalEngineering,38znpi,KingJewffrey,2,Tue Jun 9 07:44:29 2015 UTC,"Chemical Engineering is focused on processes, but this can also be applied at different scopes, including at a cellular level.   My university only offered Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering as a joint major, so I've taken something similar to the course load you're looking at getting into. I ended up in manufacturing industry so my advice may be somewhat limited on the professional side.   What exactly were you thinking of working on in regards to tissue/genetic engineering? More of an R&D side? manufacturing? business? not quite sure?"
ChemicalEngineering,38znpi,KingJewffrey,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:39:41 2015 UTC,"I think my school does the same thing.  There's the ChemE degree, but then I guess you can take major electives that are either focused in biology, polymers, or the environment.  That's like 2-4 classes, or something.  The biology focus also requires biochem.  I had gotten in contact with someone on reddit a week ago or so about tissue engineering.  They basically print out bone model defects that match the patient and use stem cells and engineering magic to fix the deformity, then replant it in the patient.  I realize that the chances of me getting my dream job are low, but that sort of thing would probably be it.  Like medical engineering.  I was originally looking into BME for that very reason, but the overwhelming consensus was that it wasn't a worthwhile degree.     There was even a redditor in this thread who was working with genetically modified bacteria to produce hydrocarbon fuels.  Not medicinal, but still interesting to me.  I've also had mild interest in pharma and medical device design. R&D and manufacturing would probably fall closest to those.   I mean I'm not really sure if a ChemE degree would lead me down the right path.  I don't know anything about getting jobs or even how to find jobs related to any of the above, let alone what skills I would need (definitely more math) and what employers are looking for.  I realized I liked biological sciences so late in my college career that I was really half-assed about deciding what I want to do post-graduation -- and the little that I did decide was that a B.S. in bio wasn't gonna cut it alone because I don't want to do strictly research or go to a health professional school :'D"
ChemicalEngineering,38znpi,ASC14,2,Mon Jun 8 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it doesn't sound like ChemE would be the appropriate choice for you this late in university. It's not specific enough and you would spend a lot of time covering fairly laborious subjects that wouldn't really apply to the career you are interested in.   I would suggest looking for a master's in BME, since it is more in tune with your goals. I honestly don't know much about what graduate schools look for in that field, so you'll have to do some more research into that.   One final bit of advice is to really start expanding your network and look for professionals who currently do what you are interested in doing. Best place for this is LinkedIn, if you don't already have one, spend the time to make a decent summary profile.   Use the advanced search feature to look for people that work at a company that does tissue engineering, or have tissue engineering in their title. You can also filter by school and help connect to people who graduated from your university.   Send them a short message saying you're interested in tissue engineering and are curious as to what the day to day job of tissue engineering is like, how they got into it, and if they would have any advice for a biology major graduating in the fall who is looking into a career in that field.   You could also ask the professor's at your university similar questions. I hope this helps! Good luck!"

It might be too early for me to give any sort of advice, but from my experience up to this point, ChemE will not help you with your agenda of getting a job with tissue or genetic engineering. It's mostly about Physics, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, scale up of chemical processes, that sort of thing. I guess this knowledge can be applied in the field of biology, but I don't think it's worth the effort."
ChemicalEngineering,38x6ge,mtchbyr,9,Sun Jun 7 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"First assumption is correct. I will add solving math problems with mathematical software or asking senior engineers. Nobody derives or integrates things by hand as far as I know.  On the second topic, I worked in a chemical plant and even there it was about 50-60% of an office setting with other engineers around. Is the  work environment different than say human resources, I think not. But if you are an offshore petroleum engineer or just a field engineer in West Texas than you will be less likely to be in an office. As for managers, I think an engineer with a business background is what I have seen the most. Engineer with and MBA. At that level you care more about profits than the little technical details. Leave that for junior engineers.  On the third comment, I know of several people that graduated with engineering degrees and ended up with construction or analysts type of jobs. The salary of the an engineer is well deserved because you have a lot of responsibility if things go bad with a project or a decision made by you.

ChemicalEngineering,38x6ge,at_work_alt,4,Mon Jun 8 17:49:33 2015 UTC,"1) Appropriate for the most. But problems might sound a little too selective when in fact it's more than problems we solve. Depends on your definition of a problem. We invent things that make the world more livable, solve world problems, bring enjoyment to our lives, and bring money to a variety of people.   2) Engineers have to interact with every kind of people. At a chemical plant if you work out in the process you work with non technical people everyday. Operators mechanics and electricians. Business people are unavoidable. The business engineer gap is hard to overcome. Some engineers can't understand all business problems and concepts, but most do. There needs to be a better liason between them but for the most part they are good to be left alone.   3) No not at all. It's because it's harder than anything to get a degree in. That is why."
ChemicalEngineering,38x6ge,gsmith67,2,Sun Jun 7 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"but our final answer was that an engineer uses physical sciences and math to solve problems. Is this an appropriate description?   Depends on where you are, but most processes are so noisy and nuanced that its usually ""Lets throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks.""  Theory doesn't always pan out once implemented.    Another topic that was discussed was the perceived separation between engineers and non-engineers. In terms of the workplace is there a distinct line between the two, and does this cause any difficulty in working together or communicating?   This isn't true. You'll have guys that barely made it out of high school that know more about how an operation is run and how to understand it far better than the engineers. Also, yes, there will be a language barrier between you and non-engineers.   Especially with management. I've walked into a meeting straight from looking at piping and its layout, to be told by a manager that wasn't so. The guy hasn't been in that area for months. This is what 6 sigma deals with, the conveying of technical information to management.    Finally, engineering careers are often towards the top of the list when it comes to salary; is this because of the difficulty describing what an engineer does, and that the title engineer has just become a keyword for difficult work?   You're usually placed into positions of power that can cost companies millions, so they pay well to attract qualified people. They want you to be able to make the correct decisions, and fix the problems you cause when you fuck up.  A prime example of this happened to me the other day. I pulled a line to clean without telling a control room operator, and they promptly freaked out and started opening/closing valves on a critical system. About the time I realized my monumentous error, I made my way back to the control room to fix the shit that was going down before production got out of spec."

ChemicalEngineering,38ogya,musicnerd1023,3,Fri Jun 5 15:25:24 2015 UTC,"I've used an Edwards RV oil-sealed rotary vane pump. That project was designing for vacuuming out gas cylinders to 1.5 millitTorr, though. (1 Torr = 1 mm HG). That's considered a medium vacuum.  Note that there are different pressure ranges where different rules apply for vacuum pumps. When vacuums get deep enough, you move from viscous (laminar/turbulent) flow regimes and equations into something called molecular flow. To calculate pressure drop in pipe under the molecular flow regime, use the Knudsen equation, not Darcy's equation.  Here's a breakdown of different vacuum ranges:   Rough (or coarse) vacuum: 28 to 0.098 in of Hg Medium (or fine) vacuum: 0.098 in of Hg to 1 um of Hg High vacuum: 0.0010 to 1E-9 torr Ultra High vacuum: 1E-9 to 1E-12 Torr   To determine which flow regime you're in, there's a set of formulas I can send you (b/c pipe diameter plays a part). If you're anywhere above 0.1 psi, for a reasonable sized pipe, you're probably in the viscous flow regime and can use Darcy's formula.  I just designed a vacuum system last year, and it was tough. PM me and I can send you the resources I used. The toughest part is sizing the inlet header to your vacuum system, especially if you're in that molecular flow regime.  Edit: added links"
ChemicalEngineering,38ogya,insert_disk_6,2,Fri Jun 5 17:26:25 2015 UTC,"Knudsen equation:       In fluid dynamics, the Knudsen equation is used to describe how gas flows through a tube in free molecular flow. When the mean free path of the molecules in the gas is larger than or equal to the diameter of the tube, the molecules will interact more often with the walls of the tube than with each other. For typical tube dimensions, this occurs only in high or ultrahigh vacuum.  The equation was developed by Martin Hans Christian Knudsen (1871–1949), a Danish physicist who taught and conducted research at the Technical University of Denmark.

ChemicalEngineering,38ogya,well-ok-then,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:21:08 2015 UTC,"My guess: you'll pretty quickly be calling vendors. There's a couple (graham and sihi come to mind) which deal with ejectors, liquid ring pumps, and ""dry"" pumps.  A problem with trying to run ""vacuum"" pumps/compressors  at significant positive discharge pressures is the seals. The ""vacuum pumps"" aren't designed expecting to run under positive pressure so they'll leak. Maybe badly. So to get to 9.5 psig, you're buying something labelled ""compressor"" which may be a fair bit more expensive.  Depending what pressure steam you've got available at what price, another steam ejector stage could easily go to 9.5 psig."

ChemicalEngineering,38ljc8,CarelessPotato,3,Fri Jun 5 01:02:59 2015 UTC,"Can confirm: I had a contract position (continuation of my last co-op term job) for a year and a half after graduating, with the stipulation being that they didn't have a permanent position but I could get one if an opening came up before my contract ended. No such luck, and I started looking for new jobs about a month before my contract end. Ended up taking 6 months to find an interview (June 2014) after that (with Schlumberger) and didn't start until the end of September. Got hired on during oil at a high price, and SLB stock at all time high. Then as soon as I was hired, oil started steadily falling, as did SLB stock, and 6 months into my job, was laid off (March 2015), 2 weeks after my first son was born. Now I'm back in the same boat as before, 3 months into unemployment and had one initial phone screening interview and jus heard back today that they will not be moving forward for a 2nd. I've been lucky to have 2 of 3 years post grad working as an engineer, but have little cross over experience or applicable skills developed (co-op post grad job was largely procurement and inventory management, which I have tried to market, along with process commissioning, but no certificates or transferable training that I can put in a resume, like a specific process control knowledge, modelling software experience, management systems, etc besides HAZOP studies and P&ID altering).   And when you have lost two jobs post-grad, regardless of whether they were an end of contract and business downturn lay-off, you now look like (on paper) that there are serious questions (from the potential employer) about why you couldn't hold a job or what your motivation is like. They want to avoid you more. It's becoming very frustrating and I am willing to take almost any pay grade or location (within reason) as long as I am able to obtain a career and build a skill set that actually can help me land a new position in the future (if need be) or get myself promoted.  For OP, take it and at the very minimum, continue keeping an eye on opportunities. The Canadian entry level Chemical engineer market was bad even before the drop in oil prices. Mechanical and civil EIT and entry level positions are MASSIVELY more abundant in every province, especially in comparison to chemical. Nearly EVERYONE I went to chemEng with in school had jobs lined up before graduation or continued with thei coop company full time. I was in this boat but was unlucky with no permanent position.  Basically, if you don't keep a job from graduation, finding a new job without having a personal or business connection (I.e applying online, LinkedIn networking) any length of time after graduating will be EXTREMELY hard, and I would caution almost any Canadian engineering student to not take ChemE unless they know they will have a full time, permanent job lined up before graduating  End rant"

Read and research as much as possible about the company and your position as possible before going in. Make it clear that you've done this by asking questions. Find out what makes this company unique.  Research the industry as well. What are the recent trends? Where are things going?  Be prepared to give examples of your work and problems you have solved.

In general your engineering degree will give you two main things that will help you to be successful in the workplace:   A solid foundation in chemical engineering concepts. Even if you don't learn everything there is to know about chemical engineering once you have this foundation it shouldn't be too difficult to extend on this knowledge to learn whatever else you need to on the job. Think about how challenging your degree is. Once you complete your degree you should confident knowing that even though you don't know everything, you are intelligent enough to learn anything that is thrown at you... Remember that time you learned an entire course on fluid dynamics in two days? Well that's likely a lot tougher than the practical skillls you'll have to learn in industry.   Also +1 for co-op.

Alibaba is a decent place to start to find bulk powder prices:  http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/aluminium-oxide-price.html  I'm using alumina in the automotive catalysts I manufacture, I'm currently paying around $1175/ton for powder milled to our specs and assayed for quality control."

Now I am interested in estimating or having any rough number for the estimation of the turnover number. If I am unable to get one I will just assume that the catalyst should be dumped after every batch cycle (of 1h30 at 210ºC). Any insight in this last matter that you can share with me?"

ChemicalEngineering,38aemg,IMKR1,4,Tue Jun 2 22:49:29 2015 UTC,"how do you guys cope with this kind of schedule? even in college i had trouble waking this early and missed 1 or 2 classes in a semseter (of course this is not acceptable in a job environment) so i am afraid that i might have a hard time waking up that early.   The trick is establishing a proper sleep schedule and sticking to it. It's harder in college where you have homework which you don't know when you will finish, but if you make sure to sleep everyday at the same time, you will wake up at the same time to.   For example, one semester when I had an 8 am class that I could not miss, I made sure that every night, I was asleep by 10 PM, which meant I was awake every day at 6 without fail. It got to the point where I was beating my alarm clock awake. Did I get enough sleep? Of course I did. Was I as social with my friends that semester? Definitely not, since they would hang out until 12 or 1. But you do what you have to do.   If you have trouble adjusting to that sleep schedule, getting something as simple as melatonin can help you get to sleep on time the first few nights."
ChemicalEngineering,38aemg,chimpfunkz,3,Tue Jun 2 23:48:19 2015 UTC,Most jobs I know start at 8 and go till 5. I have done 7 till 4 and when I was a COOP I did a rotation of 4x10s where I got in at 5:30. I would be surprised if you are working before 7 unless you were in a process engineering position where you are sitting in at the shift change meeting occurring at 7 (rare).
ChemicalEngineering,38aemg,promarkman,3,Tue Jun 2 22:56:42 2015 UTC,"When you get paid your motivation will be different.  I typically keep an in bed by 11 schedule and am up by 6:00 to make it to work by 7:30.   Occasionally I will have a late night and get in at 8:30.   I used to have to be at a 6:45 meeting everyday, I just did my best to make it happen."
ChemicalEngineering,38aemg,Weltal327,2,Wed Jun 3 00:04:46 2015 UTC,"How do you get there by 5 am? My boss would say it is simple, just go to sleep by 8 pm.  I am an afternoon person as well and I can sympathize with you. I slept through over 50% of my morning classes in college.  My job is 8 to 5.   Most people who work there show up at 7. I usually show up at 8:30. That is OK because I work hard and do a good job. How hard you work is much more important than what time you get there. But what time you get there does have an impact, and it will be seen as a negative if you always arrive late.  That is just my experience. I am sure at some companies I would have been reprimanded by now. Just find a job where you fit in with the culture."

ChemicalEngineering,387ani,nicknle,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:19:19 2015 UTC,"Typical process GCs I've seen take a slip stream (via sample pump if low pressure) through stainless tubing, usually there is some type of sample conditioning (filter, cooler, scrubber), and then it is fed to the GC via auto injector. They're typically pretty slow 5-10 minute sample time.   Micro GCs have been getting pretty popular, I'd check them out too depending on your application, but I personally do not have much experience with them. They're definitely cheaper to install due to footprint, and sample times are faster.  Usually H2 can't be detected directly, but you can estimate it based on mass balance if it is a major part of your stream and you know all the other components. PM me if you have more questions."

To avoid water hammer you have to understand where in the process steam is condensing and how to properly drain the condensate.

If you've taken multiple semiconductor classes and are applying to a semiconductor company it might be worth it, but otherwise it's better to flesh out your other stuff with that space.

A lot of batch reactors too, which is covered in general studies, but not nearly to the same extent.  Honestly I enjoyed Biochemical Engineering a lot, and sometimes wish that's the field I had gotten into. I took a microbial engineering lab that was essentially running batch reactors and it was really fun. I ended up in plastics, which I do enjoy, but they are very different.  That's one of the best things about Chemical Engineering though. It's an extremely broad field and you can pretty much do whatever you want."
ChemicalEngineering,3832b6,LusNaGreine,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:54:11 2015 UTC,Quite a few of the courses I've been looking at start with a couple of compulsory courses for non-engineers but obviously we'd have to charge through the material to get any sort of grasp of the basics. so definitely doable but yeah I'm expecting to have to play some serious catch up and just learn the other stuff as I go.

So once I have submitted the evidence that I can do the work that a BEng graduate is expected to be able to do they will treat me as if I was an MEng graduate.

You should be able to find engineers at the companies you're targeting and have a soft open that way. Also facebook's graph search is crazy useful. Search for 'people who are friends of friends and work at so and so' and it'll return a list of your friends friends who work at whatever company you're looking for. Then ask your friends to introduce you and say you saw them on LinkedIn.

ChemicalEngineering,37y31s,nash3600,7,Sun May 31 10:52:25 2015 UTC,"Sort of.   In class, you're asked to calculate flow rates or to determine the pressure drop in a system.   In industry, you see a system that isn't working correctly or you're redesigning the system and you need to calculate relevant numbers. Things like ""if I take the discharge pressure from this pump at the desired flow rate, is there enough pressure in the system to get to the desired location with the control valves, flow meters, piping, and elevation changes"""
ChemicalEngineering,37y31s,Weltal327,2,Sun May 31 14:53:54 2015 UTC,"Schooling gives you the solid background to scan through some problem or design issue and determine any red flags. It's not so much going into deep calculations (unless needed) but builds the more practical skill of knowing how things react with pressure, heat, flow, etc differentials. Keep up the work, in the end it's worth it ;)"
ChemicalEngineering,37y31s,AKEZ1,2,Sun May 31 15:44:23 2015 UTC,Mostly not. Depends if you wind up as a project/process design engineer. Larger companies and engineering firms have a set of standards to pull equipment from. And many engineers use the vendors to size equipment. I've been a ChemEng for 42 years - I've looked at a pump curve just a few times - mainly for troubleshooting. Sizing a column? - most of that is fairly standard nowadays with experienced engineers very sure of the flowrates and efficiencies. Real life does not track closely to what you are going to find in a book. The principles hold value for basic understanding....but that is most of it. Sure - exceptions abound.
ChemicalEngineering,37y31s,jerryvo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:33:08 2015 UTC,"Qualitative understanding of concepts is important for rapid troubleshooting. I work in a feeder plant to a lot of downstream units, having a solid foundation of the qualitative principals has definitely helped me be a ""hero"" engineer during plant upsets by anticipating how the dominos will fall and mitigating ahead of time to prevent a full plant shutdown.   Quantitative understanding of concepts is definitely equally important. Having a good  handle on the mathematical principals helps to build all kind of models for sizing equipment, doing efficiency studies, identifying plant bottlenecks, safety analysis, building predictive control schemes, the list goes on and on.   While you're in school it might seem a little boring since the subjects are separated out, but later on in plant design you'll see how it all comes together. It gets a lot more interesting once the concepts tie together in the real world and millions of dollars are at stake :)"

ChemicalEngineering,37u7sb,musicnerd1023,7,Sat May 30 18:31:30 2015 UTC,The always wear a suit advice is just wrong. What you should wear to an interview is very dependent on the location and position. If you showed up to interview in a suit where I work you would not get a job because everyone would think you are clueless.  I've always had good luck just asking the HR or recruiting person what I should wear when I wasn't sure.
ChemicalEngineering,37u7sb,maestro02,4,Sat May 30 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"/u/maw1585 has a very good point.   My approach (in the absence of HR guidance) is to dress 1-2 steps up from whatever everyone else is wearing. Consulting firm where everyone is business casual? Sure, wear a suit. When I had an on-site interview for a metallurgist position at the local mine where I work now, I wore newer jeans and a button-down shirt. I'm not going to show up to an interview in beat-up jeans, an old t-shirt and my steel toed boots even if that's the normal day-to-day outfit (but I'll bring the boots along just in case)."
ChemicalEngineering,37u7sb,mworhatch,1 point,Sat May 30 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say it also largely depends on who you are getting to talk to at the interview. HR drones and manglement are usually impressed with a suit, however the other engineers will remember you as the kid that was confident in their abilities rather than attire. Good khakis (NO CARGO POCKETS) and a polo or button up are often much better received than a full suit, especially if it's not a very well fitting suit.  If it's a plant site or some other location where there is safety equipment needed (gloves, hardhat, safety glasses, goggles, steel toes, etc) then dress for the job, but like brand new clothes for that job.   Also, as a probably broke college student if you think that steel toes would be needed, but you don't already have any. . . don't go buy them, companies won't expect a new hire to have those and should almost always buy them for you or at least reimburse you for them."

Biomolecular Engineering is the engineering field you want if you desire to be involved in genetics.   Biomedical is NOT what you want to do if you want to be involved in genetics. It may be a feasible alternative route,  but BCMB, Biology, and Biomolecular Engineering are what you really need to consider.  Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE) is a great route if you need a fall back and also might  want to continue on to medical school as an alternate route. The others work well as a pre med.

BME is pretty much all about building medical devices/scanners/disposables"
ChemicalEngineering,37lfm2,musicnerd1023,3,Fri May 29 01:50:21 2015 UTC,I was biomedical for 5 semesters and switched to chemical and still have a year left. I don't regret it at all as there are way more opportunities for chemicals

Biomed has been explained to me as a mechanical degree with a bio emphasis (I don't know for sure, so if im wrong please correct me).   The program at my school doesn't cover many prerequisites for medical school and offers little biology, so for those reasons I chose chemical.   You can do anything with chemical. You can go to Exxon and work with petroleum engineers or (hopefully) synthesize a new alternative fuel ;)   Or make coke. You know, the drink. It has a heap of chemicals right off the periodic table, but God do we love the taste of phosphoric acid!   Also, most of the girls at my uni are in chemical because they all want to be doctors (it has a lot of prereqs for med school) and it's closely related to biomolecular engineering which will hopefully lead to some great means of ending hunger.   But then again I'm partial."

ChemicalEngineering,37lfm2,saundsr,2,Fri May 29 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"Do NOT overspecialize as an undergrad. There are oh so many things that can change for you in 4 years(more like 6 years if you are the average student now). You might not like the specialization as much after you learn more about it, might find there are not many employment opportunities there, might find a completely different specialization that you like even more, etc.  Also, a lot of the more specialized fields want a PhD or at a minimum a Masters. That is the level when you are always expected to get specialized so wait until then.   Ultimately you should be getting a degree that will get you a job that you can survive on. Following your heart and all that is super, but it's much easier to do that when you aren't living out of your car and barely surviving.(we've all survived off ramen as college students, trust me, shit gets old after college is over though)  That's my 2 cents from seeing what's happened to some of my friends. . . you can always specialize later, it's much more difficult to generalize later on."

I saw the genetic/tissue engineering and thought you might have a school that offered some weird degree directly into those fields. Thought that would be a bad idea.  Biomedical isn't going to be a bad thing to go into regardless, at least in my experience. The biomed chemEs only took very slightly different classes from the standard chemEs and most of those were just in your engineering electives and such.  Meant all of that more as a keep your options open until you have tried out a specialty and are CERTAIN you want to do it for the rest of your life."

I can say that there has been a large shift from looking at life science majors to looking for chemical engineers even if their curriculum isn't heavy in biologics. Completing a ChemE degree is much more about proving your ability to think than trying to equip you for direct work application (in undergrad at least). So even if you don't focus on biologics you can still have a great chance of getting into pharma/biotech.

However, perhaps this is pride as a chemical engineer coming out, but it seems insane and even unethical to have an unpaid internship as a chemical engineer. A ChemE B.S. is one of the more valuable degrees, and as such commands a certain amount of respect. If a company is actually using you as a chemical engineer in the internship, you will be making significant contributions during your time as an employee. I see it as unethical not to compensate such work with a reasonable wage* and I do not want to see this kind of behavior encouraged.  .  *I think I got ~$20/hr as an intern a while back, and this was about average among my peers.  .

Were they a poor student? Why can't this kid get a single prof to write him a recommendation?   It's just plain and simple corruption and unfair practices that result in unqualified employees because they knew a guy from drinking together, nothing more.    Complete bullshit born of bitterness, no doubt. My professional network is not responsible for my success, rather I have a robust professional network precisely because I kick ass at what I do. That's why I get job leads and offers from vendors I've worked with and former supervisors and colleagues. These are people who know what I am capable of, and that's why they want to work with me. That's the opposite of ""cheating"", it's actually completely based on my merits.   As far as your job search goes I don't know what to tell you, but obviously what you're currently doing is not working and it's not because the system is unfair.

A friend of mine also suggested NRTL.
ChemicalEngineering,3780te,Ink_,12,Mon May 25 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"My chemical engineering program was physics intensive. Your math background should be very useful. However, the more advanced and properly engineering classes were aimed at developing a qualitative and approximate way of thinking. This is to say, you'll need to see what's going on and solve an open-ended problem using insufficient data and reasonably-good personal estimations. Perhaps you'll find this shocking when compared to the purity and elegance of math, but most of the time the equations describing a system are so many and so complex that attempting to solve them analytically would be wrong from an engineering point of view.  What I want to say is that you'll have no problem studying cheme but it'll require a paradigm shift."
ChemicalEngineering,3780te,voynaimir,5,Mon May 25 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"While you are in:   Decide what school you want to attend. Contact an advisor to work out a plan to meet transfer/postbac requirments. Complete as many prereqs online as you can.    I recommend taking online classes from the school you hope to attend or from a local community college which has a good relationship with the university. If you cannot do either for some reason, just make sure the school is regionally accredited.  Take one or two classes a term, depending on your availability.   Most likely, it will take three years to graduate with an engineering degree (despite you BA in math) because of the prereq science and engineering classes.  I was in a similar situation (math ed not math, Marines not Army), and I am working on my ChemE degree now. It's going to end up taking me four years. So, be ready for that.   Advice:   For prereqs, focus on physics the most, and learn MATLAB or how to create macros and to analyze data in Excel. For upper level classes, be prepared to study a lot, and don't drop out."

ChemicalEngineering,3785co,Valcatraxx,3,Mon May 25 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"It is to control flow, or to control discharge pressure.  With a centrifugal pump, the pump will move along the pump curve until it meets the system curve.  If that point is not where you want the pump to operate, you need a control valve.  It is getting more common now to put a VFD on the pump allowing you to speed up and slow down the pump, instead of relying on a control valve.  VFDs used to be quite expensive which is why there are lots of old systems without them."

Temperature, pressure, level, etc. If you have a P&ID of the control valve, look to see what controls it. It may be attached by dashed line to another circle (perhaps inside a square) that has a label such as PIC or LIC or TIC. That will tell you what property for which the valve is used to control."
ChemicalEngineering,3785co,no_other_plans,1 point,Mon May 25 18:18:51 2015 UTC,"its like more of a theoretical question, there isnt a P&ID. its just why waste energy you have put into the fluid by a control valve."
ChemicalEngineering,3785co,insert_disk_6,6,Mon May 25 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"Pumps rarely operate a the exact design conditions which they were built for. They need some flexibility. The control valve gives you that flexibility in exchange for the ""waste"".  For example, without a control valve, if you need the pump to produce higher flowrates, the discharge pressure will drop. Alternatively, if you need a higher pressure from the pump, the flowrate will drop.   Having a control valve gives you the ability to increase your flow rate a little bit while keeping discharge pressure constant. You just open up the control valve a little bit, decrease the pressure drop across the valve, and the pump moves out on its curve because there's less system pressure drop. When it moves out on its curve, the flowrate increases.  And don't be discouraged by any downvotes. This is actually not a very intuitive idea. It took me a little while to understand centrifugal pump controls."
ChemicalEngineering,3785co,no_other_plans,1 point,Mon May 25 18:43:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the helpful explanation. Could you possible expand a little bit on your third paragraph? Specifically, it makes sense that opening the valve a little bit reduces head and increases flowrate. But I need some help understanding how this keeps pressure constant. I'm thinking of explanations I've read in the past about how throttling a valve closed reduces discharge pressure after the valve (and conversely that a more open valve corresponds to higher discharge pressure). Any help you can give me is greatly appreciated! I think I knew this stuff as an undergrad, or thought I knew it, but it's escaping me now."
ChemicalEngineering,3785co,insert_disk_6,2,Sun May 31 06:59:44 2015 UTC,"Sure. Lets say there's one system that's got the following:   Centrifugal Pump that produces 100 psig discharge pressure at 50 gpm. Control Valve that has a pressure drop of 15 psi at 50% open. Piping that has a pressure drop of 5 psi at 50 gpm. Discharges into a vessel that operates at 80 psig.   So that's all well and good, right? I'm even going to attempt an ASCII pump curve here. The x is the operating point.  |______ |           ```·x·..._ |                         `·. |                              \ |_____________________ x = gpm, y = psi   Now let's say that you need to increase the flowrate to that 80 psig pressure vessel by 5 gpm. Previously, the pressure drop through the control valve and the pipes was 20 psi total. When you open the control valve a little, the pressure drop across the control valve decreases to 10 psi. Now there's a total of 15 psi pressure drop through the system. Because there's less pressure drop, the pump goes out on its curve, thus increasing the flowrate.  |______ |           ```···..._ |                         `x. |                              \ |_____________________ x = gpm, y = psi   Now there's more flowrate because there's less discharge pressure needed from the pump. So the pressure to the downstream vessel didn't change at all, but the flowrate just increased. All because of having a pressure valve in the system."
ChemicalEngineering,3785co,no_other_plans,1 point,Sun May 31 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! So the pump is now producing 95 psig discharge pressure at 55 gpm? i.e., do we know the discharge pressure exactly in this example?"
ChemicalEngineering,3785co,Weltal327,1 point,Sun May 31 19:19:27 2015 UTC,"Yep. There will be a little more pressure losses in the pipe because of the increased flow rate, but you've essentially got it. You could calculate the pressure loss change actually. Change in pressure drop in pipe/fittings is proportional to the square of the change in flow rate. So the change in pipe losses would be (55/50)², or 21% more, or 6 psi. So the pump would have a discharge pressure of 96 psig."

ChemicalEngineering,3785co,well-ok-then,1 point,Sun May 31 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are wasting energy with a control valve in place to take some of the pressure drop. If your npsh isn't changing, it is possible that downstream conditions are changing. Additionally, a control valve can serve to close on high level in a downstream vessel to prevent overfilling or on low level in an upstream vessel to prevent pump cavitation.  Let me know if I can clarify further."
ChemicalEngineering,3785co,nicknle,0,Mon May 25 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"Like i though of this part where say maybe the discharge vessel maxed out, but why not just put an valve that just opens and closes(i think its called an isolation valve but not sure)and not a control valve that does like precise level of control. Because the is isolation valve is much cheaper (according to my supervisor)"
ChemicalEngineering,3768c0,crehret,8,Mon May 25 05:39:51 2015 UTC,I completely faked my way through o-chem. Only Cs of my college career. I'm still convinced that the prof was just making up arrow pushing mechanisms as he went along. Good luck.

ChemicalEngineering,3768c0,Thelonius_Dunk,8,Mon May 25 22:52:56 2015 UTC,"Took ochem II two semesters ago (Fall '14) and got an A-  :/  Where ochem 1 is about being able to name organic compounds, learning about the various conformations and shapes of molecules and such, ochem 2 is straight up about reactions (at least in my experience).  Yes there would be theoretical questions here and there but the majority of the course as well as the exams were all about ""do you know what product(s) form as a result of this reactant going through this process under these conditions"" or ""what conditions are needed in order to obtain this product from this reaction?""  Also we had a lot of organic synthesis questions where you'd be given a starting compound and an end compound and you had to use your knowledge of all the reactions you had learned and construct a map, if you will, of how you would go about obtaining the final product from the initial through a series of reactions.  We also had a few questions that tested how well we knew our reaction mechanisms. We'd be given a starting compound and the first reaction step. Using our knowledge of that specific reaction, we would draw out the movement of electrons, hydrogen atoms, and creation and breakage of bonds to show how the reaction would proceed to give the final product.  All in all, ochem 2 focuses mostly on specific reactions and their mechanisms. For me, it was simply just memorization and recollection although by the end of the semester you were so sick and fed up. There was really nothing I could do except write down all the reactions on paper and just stare at them and repeat them until I memorized all of them for each exam. For knowing the mechanisms, since a lot of different reactions occur under similar conditions, you could sort of just memorize one mechanism and use a similar process for others. As my professor always said, ""patterns repeat themselves in organic chemistry!"""

The second semester is all about reactions and just as the first semester, some reactions have certain stipulations that will give you different products.   For example, a reaction with a primary alcohol will form an aldehyde where as the same reagent with a secondary will form a a ketone. Small differences like that are important to know. A similar situation with (archaic and presently untouched) benzene chemistry: you have a benzene ring attached to a carbon, which is double bonded to a ketone and also single bonded to an oxygen. On the other side of the single bond oxygen is another benzene ring (I'm intentionally not naming it because I'm assuming that you haven't been exposed to naming organic II molecules, I'd be happy to draw the structure if I've confused you). A big trip up question is: on which ring and on what position will attachment occur? My professor said that one is big on MCAT tests. Again, it's important to know the stipulations.   Also, some words of encouragement: the reactions list can be long and cumbersome. Stick with it, keep up your practice and in the end it will pay off. The last few chapters of Organic II are actually pretty interesting and a nice change of pace from monotonous reagent after mechanism after reagent after mechanism.   Oh, one more thing: nucleophile  (almost) always attacks carbon of the carbonyl. That's the key to the course, just as Calculus I is take the derivative set it equal to zero."
ChemicalEngineering,3768c0,sethmileskaplan,1 point,Mon May 25 14:29:33 2015 UTC,"I just finished 2 semesters of ochem at my college. Let me tell you, for me both semesters were very different from each other, with second semester being noticeably harder. I remember in first semester I was literally just cruising through real nice. Everything that was taught came very naturally to me and I did extremely well on tests and stuff. We learned the basics of ochem, such as naming, some very simple reactions, how to draw and interpret drawings, etc. Then second semester rolls around, and I am still confused on how I made it through. For me, second sem was mainly just all reactions. You literally have to know what every single individual reaction does. Also there was this random section we had where we learned about analytical chem, such as reading mass specs, IR, NMR, the likes. To answer your question, you should get ready to spend some nights just sitting and trying to memorize all the reactions. You can't go wrong with flashcards for that. One thing I did was at the end of the sem, before my final, I went through every single powerpoint slide, and made a master review sheet where I wrote down everything. 17 pages long front and back. Lastly, if you start to struggle in the class, don't be afraid to ask your professor during their office hours or after class. More times than not they are happy to help you and answer your questions, since most of them should want you to pass.  Good luck!"

ChemicalEngineering,37374z,BuzzingGator,13,Sun May 24 17:46:12 2015 UTC,"1) don't be afraid to say I don't know, but try and work on a plan so you will know. Don't always rely on others to give you the knowledge, they can be wrong, and sometimes there are 4 issues, and one person telling you their opinion is only 25% of the problem.   2) don't succumb to paralysis by analysis. Your answer may not be the perfect answer, but you spend about 20% of your time to get 80% of the answer. If you end up spending your other 80% of time to get the next 20% of your answer, your time will probably not be well spent.   3) I think this is the most important. Start off over communicating. You want your boss or people in other departments to have as much information as they want and then to tell you to scale back."
ChemicalEngineering,37374z,Weltal327,2,Sun May 24 15:53:24 2015 UTC,I think number 2 here is great advice - sometimes early on you are asked to do things that aren't that complicated and are expected to be done quickly but your boss won't pressure you with more work because you are new/inexperienced.

My second boss wanted an answer yesterday and didn't care if you wrote a grammatically perfect explanation all he wanted was an answer with a box around it.  2) Communication!

A better parameter than speed is delta p (should be around 10-50 kPa) or rho v2 (which is proportional to kinetic energy per unit volume, a measure of vibration.

ChemicalEngineering,36yu6w,Dpgg94,6,Sat May 23 07:21:26 2015 UTC,"Phases refers to the number of phases present in the system. A solution is not a phase. The phases can be liquids, crystals, and gases. Ethanol and water which form a solution (I believe at all concentrations) therefore the phase is one. Therefore C - P + 2 = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3. Therefore there are three ways the system can change and still maintain the single phase criterion. This would be the composition, temperature, and pressure. However if that ethanol/water solution was subjected to boil (will boil at different compositions for different temperatures) to reach vapor-liquid equilibrium the phase rule would be 2 - 2 + 2 = 2. Now there are fewer degrees of freedom. One variable such as pressure would need to be fixed, while two (composition and temperature) variables can change and still satisfy the two phase criterion."

ChemicalEngineering,36yu6w,vingnote,2,Sat May 23 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"I think a good way to think of a phase is a region in which density is uniform (given uniform P and T through entire system).   Thus, in non-miscible liquids there are two phases with different densities and also in solid-liquid, liquid-vapor and solid-vapor mixtures there's naturally also a difference in density between the physical states.   In practice, usually you can tell the presence of more than a single phase by looking, that is - formally - a difference in refractive index. That also characterizes a phase."

Plenty of recruitment from consumer goods and food companies that have a significant presence in the Midwest. Very little recruitment from pharma which is a lot of east coast jobs. Very little recruitment from companies looking to place on the west coast. The O&G companies from Texas were there though.

ChemicalEngineering,36tilv,lamarcus,1 point,Fri May 22 01:53:01 2015 UTC,"The best example I found in my time in UG at Texas Tech was how certain types of businesses will look in areas that fit the locality or proximity to the plant/field. Midstream companies are growing in the West/Panhandle of Texas, Eastern New Mexico, Southern Kansas, and Western Oklahoma and they visit heavily to UNM, TTU, Arkansas, OU, OSU.  I had an on-site interview where the Operations Mgr. of a midstream company said verbatim 'We look for people from schools that resemble or are nearby our operations. We don't look in the Northeast because, frankly, we doubt they would be able to handle Borger, TX or other places.'  It's true. Many people cannot handle places like Borger, TX or Artesia, NM. Flat, dry, dusty, boring, low population. It can drive some people mad.  Other than that, companies that exist in normal conditions, let's say Houston, TX, look all over. Most of the companies that I interviewed with were looking for jobs mostly in the plants that were geographically similar. Plants around the country are looking, and the ability to transfer is always there, but they generally were only looking for Texas positions to be filled, even if they had plants in SC,TN, etc. But, that being said, don't be afraid to say where you would like to work.

I didn't do an undergraduate degree at UW but the career fairs there were absolutely amazing compared to my undergrad university in the mid-Atlantic (most employers were defense contractors and government, industry was almost a no-go).  I watched virtually every student in the program, even the mediocre ones, get swept up into co-ops and it seemed that all of them had employment offers waiting for them when they graduated.  This was even during the depths of the recession.  I mean you may end up in some paper mill or food processor in the middle of nowhere for 6 months, but experience is experience. Having co-op and internship experience will make a world of difference when you seek your first full-time job.  Also if you go to a top-ranked program like the UW, it will open up not just the immediate locality but basically the entire midwestern region.  All the large companies based in the Midwest, and many from further afield, recruit there heavily.  Think Dow Chemical, P&G, 3M, Cargill, Kimberly Clark...the list goes on and on."

ChemicalEngineering,36tilv,mikey_the_kid,1 point,Fri May 22 14:29:09 2015 UTC,"Both schools are excellent for engineering. I don't think the name of the school on your resume between UW and VT will make much of a difference for employers. Location-wise, you can look into what kind of industry is in the area. For instance, I did my undergrad in Boston, so there was a lot of biotech/bioprocessing-related jobs whereas someone in Texas might find more Oil & Gas. However, I don't think this should make or break your decision since companies from all over will consider your application and the career fairs at both schools will likely be of similar quality.  That being said, UW is a Top 10 school for ChemE (as well as chemistry). Their alumni network is probably going to be a bit stronger. If it matters to you, the professors at UW will likely produce higher caliber research than VT (but I mean, VT isn't a bad school). That's how the rankings are done -- it's very much related to academia and research quality. So, I'd say go to wherever you'd be happier. You won't go wrong. The only exception is if you want to pursue a PhD (which doesn't seem to be the case here). If that were true, I'd tell you to go to UW without any hesitation. Academics love rankings."

Thermal control will be easier and crushing will be immediatly mitigated. heat, mass, and momentum transport considerations are often dominant in decisions like this. Let me just say that the opposite of your reaction is performed in water gas shift to produce hydrogen. That uses a shell and tube reactor with low tube to particle diameter ratio configuratiom to allow more homogenous flow pattern and better thermal control. Then it mostly becomes a heat exchanger design problem of materials, size, pitch.   Without saying more, I would focus on the reactor design rather than making your giant packed bed work as you describe.    Source: Chemical Reaction Engineer"

ChemicalEngineering,36sjvv,BrokenMirror,4,Thu May 21 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"These are usually tabulated at convenient temperatures and pressures, usually 20-25 C and 1 bar or atm. You can often find them in the backs of cheme textbooks, especially thermo books. If the state you want to use as reference isn't tabulated or available, you have to use one of these and then calculate from there.   Now, since chemical potential is not an absolute scale, you can also set your own reference and track the changes from there instead. Often, you will just set one state as having a chemical potential of zero and do everything relative to that.   This is the same principle you would be using by taking from a table of references, since those tables ALSO define an arbitrary zero point. This is always the case with values that deal with energy, as energy is not an absolute measurement."
ChemicalEngineering,36sjvv,FuriousGeorgeGM,1 point,Thu May 21 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"I thought you used STP and assumed zero potential and then calculated the real potential with the given pressure and temp?

EDIT: Ignore me and do what /u/FuriousGeorgeGM said. They sound like what I vaguely remember, so it just might be correct."
ChemicalEngineering,36sjvv,musicnerd1023,1 point,Thu May 21 20:23:01 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Definitions of article  Gibbs free energy:       The Gibbs free energy is defined as:     which is the same as:     where:   U is the internal energy (SI unit: joule) p is pressure (SI unit: pascal) V is volume (SI unit: m3) T is the temperature (SI unit: kelvin) S is the entropy (SI unit: joule per kelvin) H is the enthalpy (SI unit: joule)   The expression for the infinitesimal reversible change in the Gibbs free energy as a function of its 'natural variables' p and T, for an open system, subjected to the operation of external forces (for instance electrical or magnetical) Xi, which cause the external parameters of the system ai to change by an amount dai, can be derived as follows from the First Law for reversible processes:     where:   μi is the chemical potential of the ith chemical component. (SI unit: joules per particle  or joules per mole ) Ni is the number of particles (or number of moles) composing the ith chemical component.   This is one form of Gibbs fundamental equation.  In the infinitesimal expression, the term involving the chemical potential accounts for changes in Gibbs free energy resulting from an influx or outflux of particles. In other words, it holds for an open system. For a closed system, this term may be dropped.  Any number of extra terms may be added, depending on the particular system being considered. Aside from mechanical work, a system may, in addition, perform numerous other types of work. For example, in the infinitesimal expression, the contractile work energy associated with a thermodynamic system that is a contractile fiber that shortens by an amount −dl under a force f would result in a term f dl being added. If a quantity of charge −de is acquired by a system at an electrical potential Ψ, the electrical work associated with this is −Ψde, which would be included in the infinitesimal expression. Other work terms are added on per system requirements.   Each quantity in the equations above can be divided by the amount of substance, measured in moles, to form molar Gibbs free energy. The Gibbs free energy is one of the most important thermodynamic functions for the characterization of a system. It is a factor in determining outcomes such as the voltage of an electrochemical cell, and the equilibrium constant for a reversible reaction. In isothermal, isobaric systems, Gibbs free energy can be thought of as a ""dynamic"" quantity, in that it is a representative measure of the competing effects of the enthalpic [clarification needed] and entropic driving forces involved in a thermodynamic process.  The temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy for an ideal gas is given by the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation and its pressure dependence is given by:     if the volume is known rather than pressure then it becomes:     or more conveniently as its chemical potential:     In non-ideal systems, fugacity comes into play.

In a CSTR, due to the ideal mixing you will always find molecules that were just introduced into the reactor at its outlet. Thus you will never be able to fully guarantee residence time for all elements introduced into a single CSTR. For a set residence time you might want to look at a PFTR. Ideally integration of the distribution will result in 1 for t=infinity (behaviour of e-x ). Here you can find a short writeup on the residence time behaviour."

In theory you should ensure you do not affect any other existing PSVs on the line, but this is not often the case. Over a long time, the backpressure on the line can change which would affect the relieving ability of the PSVs.  We had people come in, trace all the flare lines, and re-assess the backpressure on each PSV. The finding was that some of our PSVs now needed to be re-sized or re-confiugred for higher backpressure (eg. replace conventional with balanced bellows).  Took a few months. Would be worth including if you had any meaningful input. Meaningful would be doing calcs on PSVs/relieving scenarios. Would be less meaningful if all you were doing was measuring lines out in the field all day."

That doesn't mean it's not worth mentioning and you can definitely get a lot out of it if you are inquisitive about how those numbers will be used.
ChemicalEngineering,36e3xx,LupineChemist,3,Tue May 19 12:41:22 2015 UTC,The scope of a PSV and/or pressure survey could range from simple to vast and complex.  Your questions cannot be answered with your simple definition.  Whether your doing calculations or walking down lines with a P&ID   the experience will look good on your resume.

ChemicalEngineering,36cky8,HeavyBob,3,Mon May 18 11:35:55 2015 UTC,"First thing to figure out is if you have saturated or superheated steam. Then you just use the property that you need. You just need some kind of understanding of phases, enthalpy, and entropy."
ChemicalEngineering,36cky8,odh_moyer,2,Mon May 18 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"I learned how to navigate steam tables by visualizing it graphically. Look up a temperature-enthalpy diagram for steam like this one - http://en.citizendium.org/images/8/8b/Steam_Temperature-Enthalpy_Diagram.png The bell curve is the region that has two phases inside of it. There are many combinations of properties and many 'points' within this region. When you look up a saturated steam value, only one output comes out. Thats because the saturated line will only have one output and is an actual line on this graph. The critical point separates the saturated liquid on the left from the saturated steam on the right. When you look up saturated steam at a temperature, you get a single table value because saturated steam only exists at one temperature.  I heard it over and over again, but it didn't click until I locked it into my head with this visual graph that superheated has a higher temperature than the bell curve. Superheated is a range and not a discrete line of values, so you will need more than just one piece of information to look it up, as you can see from its spread on the graph."

ChemicalEngineering,36cuth,SgtDoakesLives,1 point,Mon May 18 13:19:25 2015 UTC,are they similar in use? I remember doing alot of heat duty calculations with the Q=mCpdT but i dont really remember using the dH=CpdT equation much.  only in basic chem-e class for energy balance equation dU + dEk + dEp = Q - W  (change in internal energy) + (change in kinetic energy) + (change in potential energy) = heat - work
ChemicalEngineering,36cuth,SgtDoakesLives,1 point,Thu May 21 11:19:28 2015 UTC,"Right, they are not typically applied to similar problems.  As someone else noted, the first equation should be Q=mCp[delta]T.  It is not a differential equation like the others."
ChemicalEngineering,36cuth,CuantosAnosTienes,1 point,Thu May 21 13:08:04 2015 UTC,"I am unsure as to how strict your professor is about the terminology/labeling. The Q you mention, my professor writes as dH with a bar underneath to represent an extensive variable. Extensive variables are absolute (kJ) as opposed to molar (kJ/mol) or intensive variables, which you have written as dH. It's only a matter of whether or not you are accounting for the number of moles in the system or not."
ChemicalEngineering,36ap30,forzaflow,2,Sun May 17 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"From what I know,  heat exchanger calculations can be done with respect to either the inside tube area or the outside tube area.  Depending on what area you use the variables you use in the calculation will change accordingly. Now in practise,  it is much easier to get the temperature on the outside of the tube rather than on the inside(ie.  Tube metal temperture) .  Given that this is the temperature available to you,  you have no other option but to use the outer area since it corresponds to the outer tube temperature."
ChemicalEngineering,36ap30,the-k1ngp1n,2,Sun May 17 20:57:30 2015 UTC,"Across the profile of the heat exchanger, you have temperatures as follows:  Ambient gas-shell-shell fluid-tube-tube fluid-tube-shell fluid-shell-ambient gas  Now, the only things with areas are the insides and outsides of your shell and tubes, since everything else is expressed in terms of volumes and flow rates.   You use the outside surface of the tube because that is the surface interacting with the shell fluid and, as such, is correlated with the transfer of heat from the outer surface of the tube to the shell fluid. Neglecting variation in the temperature profile of the tube itself, your heat transfer from the tube fluid to the tube's inner surface should be equivalent to the get transfer from the outer surface of the tube to the shell fluid. Once steady state is achieved, this will hold true without that assumption. The point being, the overall rate of heat transfer is the same at either surface but the flux will be larger on the inside because the surface area is smaller.   Tl;dr you can use either, it really only matters in that the outer surface is more accessible"
ChemicalEngineering,36ap30,clvnmllr,1 point,Mon May 18 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought too, however we have a couple of problems like there:  -calculate the duty of a stream Q = m cp dT -the calculate the area via Q = U A (LMTD)   That area always refers to the outside of the tubes, (if I take the inside of the tubes as the HE area, my answer is really off). The only explanation I got was: ""The heat transfer area is always on the outside"". hmm"
ChemicalEngineering,36ap30,the-k1ngp1n,2,Mon May 18 08:47:35 2015 UTC,In the problem does it specify the basis used to determine the overall heat transfer coefficient (U)? U can be expressed with respect to the either the inner (Ui) or outer (Uo) area.   In your case it is likely that Uo is given in the problem which is why you only get the correct answer when you use the outer area in the calculation.

ChemicalEngineering,36ap30,musicnerd1023,1 point,Wed May 20 23:35:19 2015 UTC,"How is your answer ""really off""? The difference in total area between the inside and outside of the tubes should be very small if not out right negligible unless you are working with a tiny exchanger or ultra thick tubewalls."
ChemicalEngineering,36ap30,IMKR1,1 point,Mon May 18 16:15:08 2015 UTC,"So the calculation is as follows:  A = n(tubes) * diameter * PI * length n = 35 l = 15m d (inner) = 26mm d (outer) = 33mm  for the inner diameter I get 42.9m² for the outer diameter I get 54.4m² which is the correct answer  I really hope that I'm not asking a really embarrassing, stupid question here haha"
ChemicalEngineering,36ap30,musicnerd1023,2,Mon May 18 18:05:48 2015 UTC,I stand totally corrected. And this is why I use HTRI and don't do heat exchanger calcs long hand anymore.

If high school, I would say take the summer off. There's actually very little you can do to prepare for the actual industry. Maybe get a head start on your classes by reviewing the math behind your textbooks and learning it, so you can focus on the concepts of engineering instead of the math.  Other than that, enjoy your summer. From the next summer on, you should be doing internships/research/projects/etc every summer. No more breaks for you, mister.  If college senior, study for FE if you plan on going through with that route. I personally didn't, but I can see the value in taking the FE nonetheless, I guess I'm just lazy. Other than that, just apply for the jobs."

ChemicalEngineering,360wf8,ramitron3000,1 point,Mon May 18 06:09:31 2015 UTC,Post to your college's subreddit or forum and ask what books chemE students use for the class you're going to take. Ask which professors are easy/hard. Ask if they have any tests/assignments they're willing to trade for a burrito or something. Study and know them.   Study the FE exam for chemical engineering. There was a post here a bit ago with some great resources. There are a lot of topics on there but it should give you a decent base.

I know its really late though.   So far what I have noticed is there not many jobs as I thought there would be, that or my ability to find jobs is poor. I know people have recommended job fairs, networking etc. I am not entirely sure how to approach those methods especially career fairs. I have been to a career fair  but I felt like I was not able to really use it to my advantage especially that I dont have any experience I can really sell to company representatives.  I also tried a recruiting agency but when I talked to the lady in charge of engineering, she said that currently there are no entry level positions, so I got stuck there  Are there other methods to job search?"

Most major companies will do their big new grad recruiting drive in September.  Treat applying for a job as a full time job.  Get up at 8 and work until 5.  I'm not going to lie, you will probably have to do this for a while - there is no magic job fairy that sprinkles people with jobs.   You don't have spend that time sending out resumes, you can do other things as well.  What you don't want to do is fall into a rut where you sleep in and feel sorry for yourself.  Which school are you at?  Contact the career office.  Get they to review your resume.  Go for practice interviews.  Talk to your professors, they can put you in touch with the alumni network.  Most alumni will not mind going out for a coffee and giving you some pointers.     Join the local engineering association and go to events.  The student fee in nominal, and they might bypass it altogether if you can prove you have financial hardship.  This is good for networking as well.  See about attending grad school.  Again you can talk to your professors about this.  Maybe you can't get in for a Msc, but maybe you can get a M.eng."

ChemicalEngineering,35z59q,Sleazyridr,4,Thu May 14 21:24:42 2015 UTC,"Well I contacted companies that I actually wanted to work for. I expressed that I wanted to work for their company, how their company falls in line with my passion and what I had done to follow said passion (books I've read, bring up some hot topics in the field, certificates, where you see the field heading). Actually show that you give a shit about what you will be doing. Its really easy to fuck off an interview and clam up because you lying right to their faces.

ChemicalEngineering,3609wl,tbc31cc,2,Fri May 15 01:47:23 2015 UTC,"A ChemE with a BS degree usually ends up working in industry, and PhD usually works in research and is a lot more specialized. If you want to work in industry and become a PE, then getting a BS is the way to go. If you're more interested in research, then a PhD is what you want. These are generalizations though. A lot of PhDs go into industry, bit typically as project leaders, consultants, and R&D, while a BS will work as a process, quality assurance, or manufacturing engineer.    Edit: I forgot to mention... I don't know if a BS engineering degree is required for a PE, but if you end up going to grad school, a PE won't really be necessary."

I am on a fairly substantial scholarship at my college at the moment and I do not believe it will transfer over to another institution (none of which are in my state). If I could forego two more years of undergrad and attend graduate school that would be ideal for me financially. In this sense, even taking classes at my state's university (GA Tech) for a year to become a more competitive applicant and applying to a Master's or PhD program after that would make more financial sense than finishing my B.S. at my current school and then attending undergrad for two more years.

ChemicalEngineering,35t7gs,felizkitty,6,Wed May 13 08:42:26 2015 UTC,"Here is a good start.  You can tell the C4 chemicals because they will all have a word in them that starts with but- i.e. butane, butene, iso-butane, iso-butene. the C5's will have pent- i.e. pentane, pentene, cyclo-pentane.  Basic Ochem lesson, in the IUPAC naming system, the carbon backbone of the chemical is the most important part, the names follow the rules:  1Carbon: Meth- as in Methane, natural gas  2Carbon: Eth- as in Ethane, or Ethanol, my favorite molecule  3Carbon: Pro- as in Propane (God's gas, I'll tell ya what)  4Carbon: But- as in Butane, used in modern lighters  5Carbon: Pent- as in Pentane  6Carbon: Hex- as in Hexane  7Carbon: Hept- as in Heptane  8Carbon: Oct- as in Octane  9Carbon: Non- as in Nonane  10Carbon: Dec- as in Decane  Here's a good Wikipedia article on the subject.  Prefixes:  Normal- usually abbreviated 'n-' means that the chemical is specifically an un-branched species of that Hydrocarbon.  Iso- means the carbon backbone branches at some point, if a number is included with the Iso, that tells you where it branches.  Cyclo- means the backbone is a ring structure, possibly with branches on it, if there are branches they will be specified with position numbers, lengths, and if they themselves branch.  Cis- only happens in unsaturated hydrocarbons (where there are carbon-carbon double bonds), and saturated ring structures with functional groups. Tells you about the positioning of each species on either side of the bond, specifically that the similar species on each side of the bond are on the same side, which is important because double bonds, and rings, do not rotate in reactions and greatly changes how they react.  Trans- the opposite of Cis, similar species across the bond are on opposite sides of the plane of the bond  Wikipedia explains Cis-Trans-Isomerism  Suffixes  -ane, a fully saturated hydrocarbon chain, no double or triple bonds  -ene, a partly unsaturated hydrocarbon chain, at least one double bond, positions of each double bond can be noted with a number  -yne, a partly unsaturated hydrocarbon chain, at least one triple bond, positions of each triple bond can be noted with a number  Functional Groups  I could write, and many have written textbooks on the subject, but the Wikipedia page is a good summary.  Suffice to say, these are the things that make your hydrocarbon interesting, saturated or unsaturated, most hydrocarbons by themselves are only good for burning.

ChemicalEngineering,35t7gs,Science_Monster,1 point,Wed May 13 12:51:54 2015 UTC,"Hydrocarbon:       In organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon.  Hydrocarbons from which one hydrogen atom has been removed are functional groups, called hydrocarbyls.  Aromatic hydrocarbons (arenes), alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes and alkyne-based compounds are different types of hydrocarbons.  The majority of hydrocarbons found on Earth naturally occur in crude oil, where decomposed organic matter provides an abundance of carbon and hydrogen which, when bonded, can catenate to form seemingly limitless chains.      Image i - Ball-and-stick model of the methane molecule, CH4. Methane is part of a homologous series known as the alkanes, which contain single bonds only.

For example, SSBR is a polymer of styrene (not a C4/5) and butadiene (a C4 chemical). Essentially SSBR is a bunch of styrene and butadiene joined end to end to make long chains... So while it might start off using a C4 chemical, the final product has hundredsm, if not thousands or millions, orcas on atoms. Since you reference SSBR and SBC, are you specifically looking for polymers that use C4/c5 monomers?"

Find companies in your area and pitch yourself to them. You have a better chance with companies that might have a need and aren't posting online.  Internships are often viewed as a recruiting tool rather than a profit generating role. So if a company can recruit a quality person without doing the internship, that might be their preference.   Of course this depends on their needs and current workforce."
ChemicalEngineering,35q30s,curious95,2,Tue May 12 16:40:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good idea that you're expanding your search horizon outside of just petroleum. Not only is it one of the most sought out and competitive jobs as a ChE, but the recent market with oil prices has left them with tighter hiring constraints so they're turning to hiring a majority (if not close to all) of their new hires from their current pool of previous interns.  If you're going for an internship, the industry itself doesn't matter as much compared to when you look for a full time job so at this point, getting experience will help you in the long run regardless of which field you want to enter."
ChemicalEngineering,35q30s,Blue_S,2,Tue May 12 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"You’re getting some bad advice here. I graduated recently with lots of relevant industry and research experience. Due to a host of bad circumstances, I ended up not securing a full time position to start this summer. I was able to secure a post-graduate internship and regain some control of the situation. I specifically targeted opportunities that mention being open to recent graduates, usually for a period of up to 1 year. Some of what is said here is true for very large companies that have a strong corporate culture. Several Mid-sized to large companies with looser corporate culture and I would be willing to bet most smaller companies would be open to this situation.   Will also agree with what’s said above. Get a job, doing absolutely anything. In fact, doing retail or restaurant work will build skills that can get you employed. You could climb into low-level management responsibilities in these roles and that is an experience you can really sell, especially with ChemE jobs where leadership skills are heavily sought. I’m sorry to tell you this but, simply completing an ABET-accredited Chemical Engineering  program doesn’t make you that special."

What isn't a waste of time is going to aiche conferences because they have career fairs, talking with your department head because it's in his/her best interest to help you find a job, and calling up old classmates who have graduated to see if they have any leads. You should not be limiting yourself to petroleum because it's hard to break into a refinery if you haven't had previous refining internships (they seem to be more willing to give an intern a chance than to invest in a full hire with no experience). If you're just applying online you will find yourself in a world of pain because networking is going to be your best chance of getting a job.

ChemicalEngineering,35oa4k,Rossay,5,Tue May 12 07:39:45 2015 UTC,Consulting will give you a much stronger technical foundation of experiences than working for a main company.
ChemicalEngineering,35oa4k,insert_disk_6,5,Tue May 12 12:29:11 2015 UTC,"I had a similar mindset to you and had always wondered how consulting firms hire recent grads/interns. What kind of experience/expertise could they possibly have, right?  Working as an engineer at a consulting firm is just like working as an engineer for a more ""traditional"" company. A newhire isn't just thrown straight into the fire, but rather properly trained and usually set up to work alongside a more senior consultant. The work you get aren't necessarily problems that a company has no idea how to solve (and must therefore rely on 'expert' consultants), but rather work that they can outsource to consulting firms that might have more experience and time to deal with certain technical issues. That being said, consulting is not an ""unwise"" choice out of school - it won't lock you into working as a consultant forever if that's what you're worried about.  Most importantly, because this is an internship, it's nothing but valuable work experience that you can always spin to work in your favor when you're out looking for a full time job. Companies understand this, and engineering work experience of almost any kind combined with a ChE degree will give you a solid resume to pursue a wide variety of fields you may be interested in after graduation.  As a final note of encouragement - I've worked in both Big Oil and Big Pharma and I've met engineers at both companies who actually started as consultants/contractors sent to help the company, and eventually ended up being hired full time by them. Good luck with everything!"

There might be jobs for which my gripes don't apply. I've been told by another redditor, though, that actual process control jobs, where you're focused on optimizing reaction control, are not very common. It does seem that most of the controls engineer jobs are more about tying equipment (pumps, transmitters, gas sensors, etc) in to the computer systems... HMI screen development, database configuration, network configuration, interpreting plc programs, and maybe a little plc program creation.   The above work is mostly done using graphical software that feels like 1995. The people buying this stuff usually don't know what they're getting into so you're left to clean up the mess. There is a company (ignition) that is trying to modernize the HMI/SCADA, but most manufacturers are lumbering beasts that don't want to risk trying something new. Many people in controls come from electrical or trade school backgrounds. Most do not use version control or other elements of efficient software engineering.

ChemicalEngineering,35b1lg,hotcheetosandtakis,2,Fri May 8 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"before i say what I ended up doing let me make a few points about before i left for the PC:   I made sure to have about small but solid set of contacts that included friends, acquaintances, head hunts.  I joined programs that promoted connecting students/new graduates with young professionals (or seasoned professionals) and really focused on developing a friendly relationship with them and opened up about my experience and goals.  Making valuable connections rather than trying to  use this person for a job was the most important component.  When people vouch for you, that goes a long way. I had a solid resume of research, work, internships, and had a well honed resume to give to people when they asked.   Before getting back from the peace corps, I:   Contacted all my connections and stirred the pot a bit.  I called people on the phone rather than simply through emailing.  Showing initiative is the key. Focused on how to communicate the skills I obtained, the obstacles i had overcome, and what accomplishment meant in terms of foreign development.  This was not a travel around the world adventure or a study abroad bullshit moment in time.  This was not a ""i had nothing better to do"" thing.  This was a job and it was a moment that i was able to give back to humanity, communicate that as much as you can (or whatever it means to you).   People seem to think that going in the PC is a waste or they do nothing, when in reality it is an experience where you learn to be the catalyst for communities where there could be huge cultural differences and communication barriers.    Now, when i returned...I wanted to do consulting and do programming and eventually start my own company.  I ended up settling on a business consulting job (i had offers from engineering consulting) to start since 1) it made more money 2) I told them day 1 the day i was quitting to go back to graduate school (don't do this tactic, but it did get me a raise at some point for the last few weeks of work) and 3) I was a professional programmer that was able to apply my engineering approach to solving problems in Finance.  I ended up doing that for 18 months and going back to get a PhD in the field of Chemical Reaction Engineering and do basically exactly what i have always wanted.  just a few more notes:   it will not be difficult for an engineer to get accepted into the PC.  Another commenter mentioned it was ""difficult"", again this is BS.  They love engineers and you will definitely want to be an education volunteer rather then another (long explanation why will not be posted).  In genreal you will leverage more of your skills, have a better living situation, and come into a community as a respected member that will make accomplishing your projects more likely. get your essays, physicals, recommendations banged out early and speak to a PC recruiter.  The country that you eventually go to is partially due to the time of year your submit your application since they cycle through countries and don't deploy everyone at the same time.  My application took between 4-6 months from submission to leaving on a plane."

A ChE colleague ended up working with waste water treatment in a small town. Very much engineering experience.   I think he should also consider engineers without borders. I'll edit my original post.   Edit: Also, two years is nothing. The younger you are, the longer it looks, but it's not much. As a career starter, you could do worse than volunteering abroad in the third world, especially if you go out of your way to stay relevant in the field.  You'd be doing work, so you're not unemployed for 2 years, you'd be doing something objectively ""good"" and could easily market yourself as a well-rounded candidate.

But that one week you're on call especially as a engineer cause im not hourly it's not like I can go out to Houston or Dallas for fun."
ChemicalEngineering,35b1lg,curious95,1 point,Mon May 11 18:31:23 2015 UTC,The fuck... Why do agree to that? I guess they can get away with whatever when there's a job shortage.
ChemicalEngineering,35b1lg,thekid2009,2,Mon May 11 18:44:44 2015 UTC,"Because I prefer being employed vs getting laid off/fired. Also it's not like I'm not applying to other industries,  it'd hard to get a engineering job when all you have is a year internship and 8 months real engineering work experience. Chemical engineering at least in the beginning / entry level isn't exactly booming."
ChemicalEngineering,35b1lg,curious95,1 point,Mon May 11 20:17:32 2015 UTC,Sure. I'm not all that happy with my job either and am doing what I can to prepare for something else.
ChemicalEngineering,35b1lg,yellownumberfive,1 point,Mon May 11 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"Not for new hires there won't be. Nobody is going to replace somebody with 20+ years of experience with someone fresh out of school.  You would think they would promote somebody with 10 or so years under their belt and then hire a newby, but that isn't what happens in my experience. Usually they just break up the veteran's responsibilities to existing employees.   That's why I am currently do the work of three people."

I haven't been to the bakken yet but out here in west texas, be prepared for red necks, some are nice, but a lot don't like us engineers especially since we are 23/24 and their bosses while they are in their 30s, and 40s. good luck stay strong , learn to drive a 4x4 pick up."

ChemicalEngineering,357f0i,haeiley,4,Fri May 8 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"From what i understand this is pretty much common practice. Even if all of the oil is completely spent, it is still useful. You could drop the spent oil into crude stream going to a refinery and no one would even know the difference."
ChemicalEngineering,357f0i,oddnarcissist,2,Fri May 8 05:44:28 2015 UTC,"I'm very curious about this! I work in the automotive oil industry, and I've never heard anything about what happens to our products after they've spent their lifetime in the engine.  At first guess, I'd say recycling them was impossible - how would you separate out the different additives, the dispersed soot, the molecules which have broken down in the engine environment? Burning it for fuel value is the only thing I can think of, and even then you'd want to be careful because of the metals and other elements contained in some of the additives."

ChemicalEngineering,357f0i,LupineChemist,5,Fri May 8 08:58:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think most of it is just burned for fuel simply because anything else isn't very economical.  The lubricity will remain intact unless the oil was really overheated though, all you really need to do is filter it, dehydrate it and leech out any heavy metals and you can reuse it.  I suppose some is probably cracked and then distilled into diesel too."

I did a co-op with a very large engineering company in controls technology and piping modification design for gas turbines. It helped me two ways: 1. Future full-time employees saw that I was hireable. 2. I did as u/mesorouth said. During interviews, I was certain I wanted to start in a pure process chemical engineering role. This gave me confidence that I was making the right choice and I could tell my interviewers this."
ChemicalEngineering,355oks,eclecticjack,1 point,Thu May 7 16:45:47 2015 UTC,Awesome reply. Makes me a lot less nervous for the future.

ChemicalEngineering,355oks,LupineChemist,2,Thu May 7 12:01:03 2015 UTC,Honestly an environment like that is probably more likely to help you down the road than a straight office job. Jobs where the line is moving like that will have you solving technical problems pretty much immediately.

ChemicalEngineering,355jim,TiredPhilosophile,10,Thu May 7 07:52:45 2015 UTC,"I would say the biggest influence is the geographic area for where recruiters will be coming from and their pull to get recruiters from big, national firms.  Also, at a ""better"" school you are likely to be friends with people that will go more places. It has nothing to do with the quality of the education but I've fallen off barstools with people that are really starting to become important movers in my industry. That has a value but it's impossible to quantify.  Though if you want graduate school, I would say only the social networks are really important. They are great and may help out in life, but then again they may not and it's up to you if you want to pay almost 80 grand extra for that."
ChemicalEngineering,355jim,LupineChemist,1 point,Thu May 7 08:28:58 2015 UTC,I think the recruiters in certain geographic areas is the biggest factor there is.

ChemicalEngineering,354jkk,cbmb,1 point,Fri May 8 00:52:48 2015 UTC,There is no difference between an associate engineer and an engineer. The associate in front of the title indicates the level of experience desired for the position.

ChemicalEngineering,354jkk,maw1585,2,Fri May 8 02:00:03 2015 UTC,You should go to the interview and take the engineering job if they offer it to you.   You need to look out for yourself. That means taking better jobs when they come around. I can't stress this enough.  Your current employer will understand that it is just business if you explain to them that this is an opportunity for you to advance professionally.
ChemicalEngineering,354jkk,Staklo,2,Thu May 7 04:34:16 2015 UTC,"I think you are right. When the opportunity comes, I should go and take it. The thing is, I'm not so sure whether it will be a better opportunity for me besides the job title. This company is very small (less than 10 people) and I don't know if that would benefit me if I want to advance my career. In your opinion, do you think working for a large company is better or a small company. Thank you!"
ChemicalEngineering,354jkk,GoldenTechy,2,Fri May 8 00:55:36 2015 UTC,Small companies can be very good for your career. They let you do a little bit of everything because they don't have a specialist for every possible thing. They also require you to produce results because you can't hide among the crowds.

ChemicalEngineering,3521yj,omgkezia,2,Wed May 6 14:14:30 2015 UTC,Lewis & Randall's Thermodynamics book is fun to read and will prep you for thermo classes.    McCabe Smiths Unit Ops is also a good one--lots of interesting descriptions of processes.

ChemicalEngineering,3521yj,jtor1988,2,Wed May 6 16:00:55 2015 UTC,"Well Ill tell ya here is a list of the textbooks I would glance at and why I would read them.  If you wanna see what the typical staff or process improvement engineer will do everyday here are the two books I would read:  1) Transport Processes and Separation Process Principles. By Christie Geankopolis. My Recommendation  2) Elementary Principles of Chemical Processes. By Felder and Rousseau  Why: Well over the first 4 chapters Geankopolis covers the fluid and heat mechanics that you will use in general if youre the average engineer. I recommend it because it contains a bit of the understandable part of the sciences that you will use and its not boring  Felder and Rousseau is the Bible and Material and Energy balances. This is simply a book on linear algebra applied to basic chemistry. This is the most basic skill that a chemical engineer will use. If you dont do well in this not all is lost but its the most used skill in the real world so... You decide.  If you wanna see the hardest material that you will ever attempt to learn and fail gloriously at:  1) Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics. By Smith, Van Ness and Abbot  Why: Well this will show you exactly what youre up against as a chemical engineer. Its not typical that you will need to remember anything after chapter 5, but if you want to look into the face of Hell read on.   If you wanna see the hardest understandable material that you will learn.  1) Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering. By Fogler.   Why: Well this material is understandable but difficult. Itll make you feel like crap because youll slap yourself in the face saying, ""I should have got that.""   If you want to never leave process engineering and think youre the smartest guy ever.  Principles and Practices of Automatic Process Control. By Smith and Corripio.  Why: Well the people who are good at this typically never leave process engineering. They are really smart or at least seem that way because of their specialization."
ChemicalEngineering,3521yj,gsmith67,1 point,Wed May 6 14:18:57 2015 UTC,"This means a lot to me, thank you so much! I had already started with Mccabe smith's unit operations of chemical engineering, but I found myself taking jumping between chapters searching for material that I can understand easily.

When I did tutoring for Fresh-Soph students, I felt there was a 'hill' to get over in just seeing the way the processes were talked about, designed, and prompted. Not much of a riveting read, but elementary processes by Felder & Rousseau will hit these basics pretty well. You are in school, and more than likely your library has tons of books by subject (like nanotech? petroleum? the human body?) that can be perused lightly without too much interest in the hard technical parts. Also, AIChE and various trade monthlies (like 'Chemical Engineering') are great ways to get general overviews of industry topics. My favorite is the Society of Plastics Engineer's monthly, each one has a different theme."

ChemicalEngineering,34zu09,rcko,2,Wed May 6 10:03:37 2015 UTC,"""Engineering internship, but they're really busy"" ought to be rephrased to ""engineering internship, and they're really busy"".  I know it sounds better to have some veteran walk you around for days/weeks, preaching the industry gospel, but if they're as busy as you say then 1) you're going to get plenty of hands-on experience, and 2) there's a much better chance that someone will get desperate and 'need an extra hand' on an awesome project.  Perhaps that sounds a little sketchy - the last days of my internship involved a ""you don't exactly have clearance for this, but fuck it, I'm swamped"" - but as long as you're prepared to seize any and all opportunities it's a blessing in disguise."

ChemicalEngineering,34yf5t,DrBrOrion,9,Tue May 5 16:25:37 2015 UTC,"It's hard to think of physically, but it's the deviation in Gibbs energy of the actual solution from that of the ideal solution.   Dividing by RT just makes it dimensionless."
ChemicalEngineering,34yf5t,Illusions_Micheal,7,Tue May 5 19:07:44 2015 UTC,"First you should get a glimpse of what the Gibbs free energy is. It is basically the work you can get off a thermodynamical system at constant pressure and temperature. It is also a thermodynamical property (a state function), so it has a defined value for a given substance at a given T, P and composition. It is the key energy to analyze the spontaneity of transformations, like chemical reactions or mass transfer processes, occurring at constant P and T.  Gibbs is G = H - TS, by definition. For isothermal transformations, ∆G = ∆H - T∆S. So for pure substances Gibbs works just like any other thermodynamical property, in which it is determined by simply T and P. For mixtures, we have the problem of the relationship of Gibbs and composition.   To overcome that complication, we create the ideal solution model. In this model, the Gibbs energy of a mixture is very simply related to the Gibbs energy of the pure components and their composition by a logarithm expression. This is done assuming that mixing gives no enthalpy change and the entropy changes are equivalent to the entropic gain of mixing two ideal gases (entropy always increases with mixing, because of higher number of possible microstates).  The model works for mixtures of chemical analogs, but most solutions aren't like that. If you have ever spilled some water and then some ethanol on your hands you can feel that the dissolution is exothermic. So the Gibbs free energy of a mixture is not the one supposed by the ideal solution model. So we either discuss the real Gibbs energy of the mixture, or the difference between the real quantity and the ideal model, which is called the excess energy.   The only reason we would choose the excess Gibbs energy instead of the literal Gibbs energy is because the equations look better in that format. Is it analogous to using residual properties when discussing real gas deviations from the ideal gas model. The advantage is that the equations are simplified.  Keep in mind that the excess Gibbs free energy is only logarithmically related to the activity coefficient when it is taken as a partial molar property.  I hope this helps."

Substitute IDGL and solve for pressure decay:  dP=V'(t)Patm/V  Your leak rate is:  V'(t)=(V dP)/(t Patm)  I will leave it as an exercise for you to adapt this to a two exchange, it is simple enough if you just think about what is going on."

ChemicalEngineering,34ggu7,Jokiesamoster,5,Thu Apr 30 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"The ""speed of sound"" of a medium is nothing more than the speed at which mechanical waves are propagated through said medium. Sound itself is a particular case of a mechanical wave. In general, pressure differences are propagated at the speed of sound. What is happening under choked conditions, very informally, is that any larger pressure difference can't be propagated backwards fast enough (because the medium is already moving at the speed of sound itself!). The fluid is unable to ""feel"" the low pressure.  If you are serious about compressible flow you should read Landau & Lifschitz Fluid Mechanics. They explain exactly this but more formally although their prose is invaluble."

On Monday actually. Let me tell you this: you are way more likely to get a job if you have a job. And, on top of that, If it gives you something to talk about that's even better. Even engineers have to climb the ladder sometimes, I think we forget that so no, you won't be judged or something."
ChemicalEngineering,34fo7g,Trueno07,2,Thu Apr 30 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"1) I would think if you explained that you took it while job searching just to get some experience and extra cash they would see it as a good thing.  It seems like a better use of your time, and depending on what industry the lab tech position is for it might help you out.  I can see the lab tech position offering the possibility to get low balled by a new employer, be mindful of your worth with a chem e degree and negotiate an appropriate pay. 2) You obviously don't tell your current employer, take the interview for whenever the new place suggests and take off that day from the lab tech job no matter what.  It's not for long term, and furthering your career to where you want it to go is more important than making bad blood at the tech place for taking off at a bad time."

I've only been here a short time but the already company loves me and are talking about long term opportunities I could grow into for the future.

ChemicalEngineering,34fo7g,ishouldwritthispaper,2,Thu Apr 30 22:05:05 2015 UTC,You'll be fine. Look to see if they have chemE positions in another part of the company. Shine bright and you may get one of them. They will expect you to be looking.
ChemicalEngineering,34fo7g,BadDadWhy,2,Thu Apr 30 22:48:04 2015 UTC,"In the interviewing process, the employer does not have time to worry about how you're feeling, how your life is right now, etc. the only thing they are concerned with is: is this candidate qualified for this position and is this candidate going to be a good long-term investment.  Time is money in industry and all the employer sees out of your endless job search is a gap of time where you were doing literally nothing, showing a low work ethic (would you invest in a company that catered to low work ethic?). Your degree is certainly worth something but a long unemployment gap with no excuse other than ""I couldn't find the right job"" is a sign of laziness rather than a sign of your integrity for not ""settling."" A job in the middle instead shows pursuit, ambition, work-ethic, and good recommendations are never a problem either. You obviously would not be applying to the Chem Eng. position if you were content and want to work as a lab tech. for your whole life - also do not forget that your employer is a human and they may have risen the ranks from a much lower position as well many years before you did.  Let me bring up another point. Do you assume when you get to your first industry/lab engineering job that you will know what you're doing? (i.e. how to do all the calculus, perfectly? how to walk a pipeline in the field, handle business relations on a daily basis with other companies, how to properly work with business bureaucracy or potentially all the things you'd have to do in a lab?)  I understand if you've done a few internships you will have a gist of things but on an expert level? Probably not. You will most-likely spend your first 6-24 months being the industry your going into, learning the ins, outs, and everything in between. You're going to fail, miserably, multiple times, and that is okay! In order to get there, though, you've got to come off as a person who looks at the bleak and sees opportunity (which is what taking the lab tech. position will help portray). The employer just wants somebody they feel confident will work hard, learn well, and make them money.  2) Fuck what the other company thinks, do not associate business with sentiment in any way. Idk if you have kids but imagine if this pay raise would mean a better life for your spawn/family AND its the job you WANT to do. You're making the company money as a lab technician, do not think they are people to hold vast respect for just because they pay you. You pay you with the work that you do. Do what you want to do to reach your success and don't look back. A burned bridge is fine if you've got a better bridge to a better place."
ChemicalEngineering,34fo7g,nickofthenairup,1 point,Fri May 1 01:32:26 2015 UTC,So I've worked as a technician as an intern in college but after I graduated I started working as an engineer. I do have the unique perspective of hiring a person who was a technician to work as an engineer.  This person was already working for my company and so I already knew a lot about this person and their work ethic. Knowing this persons work ethic told me all I needed to know about this person. They were an extremely hard working as a technician so it gave that person a lot of bonus points in job hunt for an engineer. I basically had to convince this person to apply for our engineer position (our techs get lots of OT). Once they applied I asked a few technical questions and all the answer were good so they were hired on the spot. This was two years ago and looking back I can say it was a great hire on my part. 10/10 would hire tech again!  TL;DR Take the tech job. Keep looking.
ChemicalEngineering,34fo7g,maw1585,1 point,Fri May 1 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"Go for the technical position if they give you enough freedom to be a bit creative. As a chemical engineer you'll do pretty much the same, and most of the time, employers will appreciate a chemical engineer who knows his way through the lab. From the moment you notice you're not learning anything new anymore,quit the job and search for something better. I myself studied chemical engineering and did a job as lab technician for 3 years, and now they are offering me to do a PhD. So I guess if it is a fun environment to work and it gives nice oppertunities, go for it and you'll get the rewards later on!"

ChemicalEngineering,34cj20,insert_disk_6,3,Wed Jun 3 10:38:54 2015 UTC,"""Technology"" is a pretty broad subject. I know ChemEs who are involved in all of the technologies you mentioned.    Phones: All kinds of material engineering goes into phones.  3D printing: Polymers are an area with many ChE applications, and 3D printing is being applied to many research areas and industrial purposes. Web: Not a traditional ChemE discipline but anybody can get into web development.  Computers: Super broad again, but there are tons of opportunities for ChemEs in computers, both in hardware and software. ChemEs can do programming type jobs, especially with data analysis and statistics. On the hardware side, Intel and other semiconductor companies hires hundreds of ChemEs to do everything from wafer manufacturing to product testing.  Medical related: Lots of ChemEs in pharma industry like Genentch, and some work in the medical device industry too. More likely to need a grad degree narrowing in on bioengineering type subjects, but there's jobs for BS ChemEs too.    The possibilities are really open for chemical engineers. Most of the ChemE grads I know don't work in traditional chemical process industries.

ChemicalEngineering,349mc3,thiele-modululs,4,Wed Apr 29 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"There are two different chemical reaction engineering books by Levenspiel. ""Chemical Reaction Engineering"" is the standard and is used quite heavily outside the US since it is translated into so many languages. The book you have (the handwritten book) is most likely Levenspiel's Chemical Reactor Omnibook, which is quite a unique text.  I know Octave and YES, he does prepare his books by hand. The Omnibook is published as he prepared it, although some of the illustrations were done by Oregon State art students.  I have been reading reddit for a long time, but was never motivated to make an account until I saw these comments about autographed books and selfies with authors. The activation energy to make an account was finally reached when I decided I would share this story about Octave Levenspiel:   When he finally vacated his office space at Oregon State he had quite a mountain of papers and nobody to help him move them, so he asked a couple of us grad students who were working on the weekend if we could give him a hand. Of course we jumped at the chance, since the man can really tell a story and is seriously entertaining. As we were loading stacks of papers into his car (which was a total hooptie, even though he has done quite well for himself financially), I spotted a manila folder stuffed with handwritten papers that looked pretty familiar. I said ""Is that what i think it is? Is that handwritten orignal of Engineering Flow and Heat Exchange?"" He said ""Yeah, I don't have any use for it anymore, you want it?"" So of course I said ""hell yeah"" and he agreed to give it to me on one condition ...... that I ""Never let it fall into the hands of an undergrad."""
ChemicalEngineering,349mc3,maw1585,5,Sat May 2 15:20:43 2015 UTC,I met Fogler at an AIChE conference one year. Got myself a selfie with the man. He was old and cool with it.  What was the question again?
ChemicalEngineering,349mc3,voynaimir,3,Thu Apr 30 05:20:28 2015 UTC,"Fogler teaches by giving examples, which may be intuitive for some, but I just found it exasperating. It's like he shows you every tree there is and then you have to understand that they are actually the same thing and part of a forest.  Edit: I mean you will understand eventually, but it's far from a good and elegant book like you may find reading Landau & Lifschitz, BSL, Spivak's Calculus."
ChemicalEngineering,349mc3,Rossay,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:09:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. While I still think Fogler is great, Levenspiel ""clicked"" with me better. I'd recommend both books, it will just depend on which one suits your learning style."

His explanations are poor and mostly he just gives you plug-and-chug material. Levenspiel provides much better explanations and made Kinetics much more interesting.    In my experience, it was like using BSL for Transport and how it provided much better explanations and examples than Deen does in his book."

ChemicalEngineering,345u5k,insert_disk_6,18,Tue Apr 28 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. The high level guidance is what a student should be able to expect from their peers. I feel most everyone on this sub is perfectly capable of telling when a student is struggling and looking for guidance versus being lazy and wants a free ride.(at least I would hope that most could see which case it may be)  That said I've been scolded before for helping out some people in /r/EngineeringStudents before. They had posted all the work they had already done and did not see where they were making a mistake and still getting the wrong answers. In that case, seeing that they had done all the work themselves and just weren't getting something I helped them out. I did not ""do it for them"" but told them where their mistake was, and explained why it was a mistake. I have no idea why I was scolded for this. I wasn't ""giving"" them a thing that they couldn't have gotten from any decent professor.  The same thing for someone that recently was asking about help setting up an Aspen simulation. Someone else in the thread realized it was this years AIChE challenge problem and suddenly no one wanted to help the kid at all. He didn't want anyone to give him the answer at all, he had technical problems with the program. How is getting technical help ""cheating"", that's like forcing someone to fail an exam because they are blind and you don't want to make your test in braille.  I feel there is a bit of ""hazing"" for lack of a better term sometimes when it comes to asking for help. People that feel, ""I didn't get help like this when I was in school so why should this kid?"" That is never a good reason not to help someone out. Helping them will hopefully lead them to keep coming back here and trying to also help out others. It's a good way for the community to grow.  TL;DR: Sometimes there is a very fine line between doing someone's work for them and helping out someone that is just utterly stuck while doing their best. I hope that we can all use our best judgement on this and not use this as a way to make students' lives unnecessarily more difficult. We all had those late nights when we just needed a little push in the right direction. . . be the push, not the crutch."

ChemicalEngineering,345u5k,musicnerd1023,7,Tue Apr 28 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, as engineers entrusted with the public safety, we have a duty to uphold the standards of our profession. Doing students' homework problems for them clearly compromises their education and thereby compromises their ability to carry out their duties as professionals.   In the real world you don't have all the answers, so figuring out polite ways to solicit information from your superiors is a valuable skill.  Being able to quickly find the person with the answer, or get them to do it for you, is just as valuable as being to calculate the answer yourself, in the real world.   I feel strongly that we should not allow these kinds of questions in this sub. I'd also ask that you report any posts you feel clearly cross the line into this territory. I think that even the students on here have an awareness of this. Generally there are few posts like this.   Some kids have to watch the machine running before they understand its individual pieces."
ChemicalEngineering,345u5k,Rossay,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"Some kids have to watch the machine running before they understand its individual pieces.   This is a good point. However, I don't think this sub is the place for that. Schools provide resources for this. Office hours, other students, etc. We COULD do this, but it's a slippery slope. Ethically, I feel uncomfortable for answering students homework questions with step by step answers. It may be helpful to them, but they typically have other resources for this. There's just an interpersonal component missing on Reddit that I think compromises my ability to help people with homework in a constructive way. That's my feeling, but I'm glad you make the points you did. They helped adjust my thinking."
ChemicalEngineering,345u5k,ekspa,2,Wed Apr 29 13:53:43 2015 UTC,"Ultimately in any engineering discipline it comes down to knowing the material. The way in which the necessary knowledge is obtained should not matter what so ever.   I always felt that classes that ""group work"" was utterly banned in missed the point. You are trying to learn skills for the rest of your life. In the real world no one gives a flying crap whether you just know something off the top of your head, searched it on google, or knew exactly the right person to ask. They care that you can get the answer in a timely manner regardless of the method. Certain methods will be more impressive than others, but that is also subjective to the person you are demonstrating your abilities to. (my younger friends are not impressed when I can find an answer to something online in seconds, while my older colleagues are blown away when I have found them VLE data with about 10 minutes of googling)   If a student goes anywhere and wants someone to do their homework for them because they don't understand it and they have no intention of learning the material that WILL come back to bite them. Either they will fail their finals, the FE exam, or an employer will fire them. It will be obvious that they don't know what they are doing.   I'm not trying to debate ethics here. I totally agree that getting someone to do the work for you and turning it in as your own is wrong. But ultimately it doesn't matter in the bigger picture, if you don't learn the concepts somehow you will NEVER be a decent engineer, much less a good one.  I try to think back at how often I use anything that I learned in classes and it astounds me how little of it I really use. But when I go back and think of when I was utterly stuck on some problem (like I might be in that very moment with my job) and what I did to figure it out or find the information I needed. . . THAT is a highly useful skill. Maybe it's having superior google-fu, or how to search a library (corporate or school), or knowing other people's specialties, or even knowing of a good online community. . . those are the skills that all good engineers need to have. Why would you want to take that away from people?  As a hypothetical to you; What if someone in industry had a problem and basically needed someone on here to ""do it for them""? Would you turn them away? If so, why would you turn them away?"
ChemicalEngineering,345u5k,Rossay,2,Wed Apr 29 17:48:43 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. As a college student myself, getting just an answer (from anyone) does not satisfy me. I am more concerned with the how and the why behind the way things work.  I think you put a great perspective on the matter and how it relates to their professional lives after school. Not only could it compromise their duties as professionals, but it can compromise safety as well."
ChemicalEngineering,345u5k,ekspa,2,Tue Apr 28 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who used to be an educator, I'd like to make an important point: different people learn in different ways.   Education and learning methods come in a broad spectrum. Making  blanket statements like ""doing _____ doesn't help anyone learn"" or ""you don't learn by doing _____ "" aren't accurate. Just because that's how you learned or that's your opinion doesn't make it true.  Now, I'm not saying for one minute people should be expected to provide spoon-fed solutions to obvious homework problems, but we shouldn't be dictating how people should/shouldn't learn.   I'd echo the sentiments of /u/LeSTEMLibertarian in that some people need to see the answer and reverse-engineer it to really understand a concept. Plus learning to solicit advice from experts is an important life-skill for industry.  TL;DR As with life, learning isn't black or white, there are many shades of grey."
ChemicalEngineering,345u5k,Rossay,2,Wed Apr 29 08:22:55 2015 UTC,My only issue is that we don't know what the teacher's policies are on working in groups.  Is it fair to the students playing by the rules if they're graded on a curve against answers given by professionals here?
ChemicalEngineering,345u5k,mhanders,2,Wed Apr 29 13:45:21 2015 UTC,I've never come across someone having a policy of explicitly banning group work. My own opinion is that group work is a really valuable learning tool and I'd strongly encourage it as it's such an important skill to learn for industry. Effective group work is the lifeblood of process engineering because you cannot possibly be expected to be an expert at everything so learning to draw on others' skills and talents is important.
ChemicalEngineering,345u5k,ekspa,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"I took multiple courses which explicitly banned it.  Their reasoning was that they were grading your answers, not the answers that you copied from the smartest person in your group without understanding them.  There's such a difference between giving solutions to problems on Reddit vs asking for help in a professional capacity.  For one, in a professional atmosphere, you know that anyone asking a question legitimately wants to improve.  On Reddit, there's no way to tell the difference between someone looking to improve and someone looking to have someone else do their homework for them.  I'm not against providing conceptual understanding;  I'm completely against providing the exact solution."

Bubbles, foam and fizz are still an active research area in fluids and thermodynamics.  As to what might have caused it, a pressure wave would have been formed when the bottle hit the floor, briefly changing the physical conditions. Maybe the CO2 would have been instantaneously dissolved and released while being sloshed around with the liquid, causing foam."
ChemicalEngineering,33vwke,Valcatraxx,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:24:18 2015 UTC,"I would agree with the idea of the gas being dissolved and released instantaneously.  Obviously the bottle if left undisturbed will be at some equilibrium and shaking it will change disturb the equilibirum.  If you drop it the volume change could increase the pressure and cause the undissolved CO2 in the gas phase to dissolve into the liquid, then when the bottle returns to its original shape and tries to regain its original equilibrium by releasing some of that recently dissolved CO2. Its not perfect so there will be some overshoot both ways.  It's a mass transfer problem somewhat similar to dissolving something in a solvent. It will reach some equilibrium solubility and if you shake it or heat it, it will dissolve more. Then when it cools or settles it will release that dissolved solute.  It's obviously much more complicated than that, but I think the dissolution example is an ok way to simplify it."
ChemicalEngineering,33vwke,thefrientzone,2,Tue Apr 28 00:29:46 2015 UTC,"I think a localized pressure change could participate in this effect. I don't know the extent to which this applies, but I have a feeling it also has to do with the solution dynamics of soda. Carbon dioxide is allowed to equilibrate under higher than ambient atmospheric pressure, but less than ambient temperature (its been in the fridge). Both temperature and pressure affect the solubility of CO2 in water. Pressure is directly proportional to solubility (P goes up, solubility goes up) seen here. Temperature and CO2 solubility are inversely proportional.   It is my understanding your Mt. Dew is given an adequate time to dissolve the equilibrium amount of CO2 into solution (for that T and P), but the dissolved gas should increase solubility if pressure is increased (let's say you squeeze it). So does a drop lessen pressure temporarily, causing a 'knock-out' of dissolved gas?  My best guess to the observed change is the shifting of the inter facial boundary, and the mixing of liquid and vapor phases, causing the solution 'matrix' to be disturbed, see physical ideas such as solvation shell. Agitation of the liquid, or the introduction of nucleation sites such as the famous Mentos/Diet Coke gig, can cause these CO2 molecules to 'gather' and fizz out of solution."
ChemicalEngineering,33vwke,SteamTables,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:18:19 2015 UTC,"Solvation shell:       A solvation shell, in physical chemistry, is a structure used to describe solvation. A solvation shell is a shell of any chemical species that acts as a solvent and surrounds a solute species. When the solvent is water it is often referred to as a hydration shell or hydration sphere.  A classic example is when water molecules form a sphere around a metal ion. The electronegative oxygen atom contained in the water molecule is attracted electrostatically to the positive charge on the metal ion. The result is a solvation shell of water molecules that surround the ion. This shell can be several molecules thick, dependent upon the charge of the ion.
