Petloss,3e1lbk,Kellianne,2,Tue Jul 21 06:43:22 2015 UTC,"It's been less than a week for me and I'm broken. I know EXACTLY what you mean when they'd come up on the couch and just hang. I used to call it Iggy's work. That was his job.   Ive been going to a pet loss meeting and it really helps...in a way. 5 months is a while but then it's really nothing to the years we had.   Logan always IS, and always was. I'm hoping that relating can make us all feel a bit better."
Petloss,3e1lbk,ProtonDeathRay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"Less than a week.  I'm so sorry. Making the decision to let Logan go was one of the hardest things I've done.  I wish I could find a group around here. The one's I've found meet like once a month at really strange times.  Thank you, and chin up."
Petloss,3dysy8,246209r2,4,Mon Jul 20 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"Wow - that's a lot to deal with and I'm sorry for you for that. It sounds like losing your little one brought up some much-needing-to-be-dealt-with issues with your wife. Make sure you are separating the two relationships - and especially the feelings that come with each.  Maybe talk short-term to a therapist or a trusted friend to help you get through all these changes/possible changes ""as intact as possible"". Positive thoughts to you~"
Petloss,3dysy8,MelJoKi11,7,Mon Jul 20 19:46:09 2015 UTC,"Everybody grieves differently, but IMHO you still crying daily doesn't seem healthy. He was not your son. A son can be expected to outlive you, however you should expect to outlive your cat. I lost my cat 5 months ago, I have my moments where I tear up if I look at his pictures or dwell on his last day, but I have not allowed my grief to interfere with my life or relationships. It's time to move on and work on keeping your marriage healthy. Your cat would not want you to still be miserable 4 months later."
Petloss,3dysy8,josh6499,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"Here's an example of where people don't get it. He was indeed my son, as much as any human could be. Beyond that, he gave unconditional love and loyalty, something few people ever do, not even my wife. So the grief is equal to or greater than the loss of a human. My first wife died of cancer, I have had friends and relatives who died, so I think I know what I am talking about."
Petloss,3dysy8,josh6499,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:51:29 2015 UTC,"No I get it, you're putting the value of a relationship with a cat over that of the relationship with your wife. I can see why she is getting frustrated with you. I really think you should seek professional help as others have suggested if you can't see that is not an approriate reaction to the death of a pet. I'm not going to coddle you at this point. It's been 4 months. Continuing to wallow in self pity is selfish and inconsiderate to your wife. Get over it. Even if he was a real human son, which he wasn't, it would still be unreasonable not to move on. It's even more unreasonable given it was a cat. I'm surprised your wife hasn't left you already, you're lucky to have a woman that has put up with your pathetic blubbering this long. Sorry to be harsh, but it's what you need to hear. Suck it up, he's gone. Letting his death ruin your life dishonors his memory, live the life he would have wanted you to live."
Petloss,3dysy8,littlewolfen,0,Tue Jul 21 16:21:23 2015 UTC,What you need to hear is me coming up behind you before you hear me. Wish I could. Don't reply to any more posts.
Petloss,3dysy8,ProtonDeathRay,4,Tue Jul 21 16:50:50 2015 UTC,"Please consider seeing a professional. It's nothing to look on as bad, they can help you find a place to ground yourself when you are drowning in grief.  Grief never goes away, but we learn to cover it up with scabs or to put it in a box that we hold in our hearts.  Your grief is unique as your relationship to your cat was and no one but you had that with him. We call all relate and understand to an point. I still mourn all the kids that I raised and outlived. Two years ago I helped my boy Doc to no longer suffer the cancer that ravaged his body. He was my joy. Every day I laugh, go out with friends and love my current kiddos with all my heart, but my joy is gone.  Sending you internet hugs. And plead you talk with someone that can help you find yourself again. Your boy wouldn't want you to not give forward the love that he gave you."

I've been going through lots of pix of my beloved Husband, the Iggy Cat I lost last week and thought I'd post some. Can you not post ""retired"" pets? I saw retired because Iggy's job was to love and he loved everyone.   Your baby kept you safe and happy."
Petloss,3dsce7,lyawake,2,Sun Jul 19 00:03:51 2015 UTC,My condolences. I lost my beezer back in 2011 and still really miss them a lot. Same with all the dogs I've lost but I feel better when I pour the sadness I feel when I miss them into being there for others. Why not pour the love you felt for your friend onto your moms dog? I'm sure they could use it.
Petloss,3dsce7,ziddersroofurry,2,Sun Jul 19 03:44:32 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea, I don't get to see her dog often cause I don't live with her. She also keeps her dog in a crate for most of the day and it makes me pretty sad.   It's beautiful and sad the way a pet impacts your life, no matter how much time has passed you still miss them"
Petloss,3dsce7,ziddersroofurry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"Crate training isn't a bad thing as long as they're getting enough exercise/interaction. Still-going over to spend time with them can't hurt. :) I'm sure you'll both appreciate it.   And yeah...I barely knew my first dogs. A St.Bernard and his little Beagle friend but I had the Cocker Spaniel I got as a gift when I was 8 until I was 27. I wasn't able to be there when she passed on and that hurt a lot. Later on I ended up marrying someone who owned four Ibizan hounds. Two of them died due to epilepsy ( really hard on me because I'm epileptic and know how terrifying it can be to have a seizure) the other two of old age (which for beezers is about 12-14).   Right now we have three amazing beezers who I love to pieces. They're kinda perfect for me at least because they sorta look like kangaroos (or deer depending on what angle you look at them from lol) and have amazing personalities. They're literally living, breathing cartoons.   Despite all the pain that goes along with having an animal companion I can't imagine not sharing my life with one. I hope you and your friend bond more and it helps you some. I'm really grateful to know there are people like you out there who care so much."
Petloss,3dsce7,ziddersroofurry,2,Tue Jul 21 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not crate training, she just keeps animals in crates. She used to keep my cat in a small crate for over 12 hours a day.   Awe your  dogs sound adorable, I like dogs that are a little crazy! lol. My boyfriend has 3 cats and he looks after mine as well, they fill the hole of not being able to get my next dog for awhile. I love cats just as much, they are great cuddlers :) thank you for your kind words"

Petloss,3dbrrk,babble_on,2,Wed Jul 15 03:38:47 2015 UTC,"trust me, ive cried so much losing my animals where i couldnt even open my eyes they were so puffy and my skin so sore.  its the most painful dagger in your heart feeling, i know.    yes!  see, as you look at her picture and have those thoughts...know that is Jo trying to convey her messages to you, as best as YOU can understand.  youll know when you feel that special feeling in your heart and soul.  its indescribable, but i think you know what im referring to.  a moment of silence along with happiness and a smile.  that is her helping you with her loss.  smile.  smile because she is free.  smile because you both shared a special love.  smile because you both learned from each other.  and, finally, smile because she is still with you and will always watch over you and those you love.  remember, what she wants the most from you is the exact same thing you wanted for her...to not be in sorrow, but to be happy and free.    it will get easier.  up and down...waves.  again, hang in there!"

That meant something to him, I assure you.  You might find some solace in volunteering during what little spare time you have. After I lost my cat I fostered some cats, and it was a very fulfilling experience. The rescue groups almost always provide you with food and litter for your foster cats, and you're not responsible for vet care.  The more foster homes rescue groups have access to, the more cats they can pull from kill shelters and off the street. It's too late for your little man, but helping other animals who are suffering would be a nice way to honor his memory."
Petloss,3d5x10,scrunchi2003,2,Mon Jul 13 20:14:29 2015 UTC,"iv looked into fostering in the past, but as far as i know you cannot have any other pets if you wish to foster.   and yeah, that line of thinking is about the only thing getting me through the day. im not sure if i totally believe it, but it helps somewhat."
Petloss,3d5x10,scrunchi2003,2,Mon Jul 13 21:14:59 2015 UTC,"I have a dog as well, and the rescue group I fostered for was fine with it, since she's good with cats.

Last April, my little old tabby cat passed at 16 years old. I got a 6 month old calico girl, and she fell in love with my fat old orange tomcat. She wanted to play with him all the time, and I thought it was cool because he was losing weight with all the playing. But it turned out that if cats lose weight too fast, they can get fatty-liver syndrome and die, and that's what happened to the orange boy in July of last year. So I adopted a 3yo Maine Coon mix boy, and in March of this year he passed from FIP. But now I have these two, and hopefully I'll be set for the next couple of decades."

It is hard holding it inside in public, so it will likely come out with you at home for quite a while and it sometimes it sneaks up on you even after lots of time has passed. Don't let her blame herself for anything and try to keep her from second guessing the decision, those seem to be things we all do to ourselves. Let her choose how to memorialize her baby however extreme it might seem to you. Share your memories when the time seems right, it feels good to know others loved your baby too."

Tiger was having trouble breathing so my mom took her to the vet and thats when they told her she was going to die within a couple of days and putting her down immediately would be the best option. My mom came back crying, and we said our final goodbyes to Tiger. My mom, sister, and I all went went back to the vet an hour later and watched Tiger get put to sleep as we pet her head goodbye.   Tiger dying was extremely sad, because I grew up with her, but knowing that she was 82 in cat years and was no longer suffering was comforting. Watching my tough as nails mom burst into tears apologizing to her ""baby"" for doing this to her and just breaking down was 3 times worse.

The rainbow bridge would signify our happiness when we feel the powerful nature of reuniting with our far-away friends. It's sure to come : may it be soon that your family always feel the looming presence of love, for hopefully love will be the quickest way to peer past the chasm that is life. (And just to clarify, I mean that maybe if we're positive about incidents like this, like how I lost a cat myself.. It is my experience that dreaming of them is like getting a taste of the rainbow bridge, and the dream was sort of induced because I was optimistic that things would start to look up soon enough :) )"

Petloss,3bw17r,Roxymoron,2,Thu Jul 2 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss. It sounds like Harley had a cherished life and was lucky to have you as an owner. I just lost my cat of 12 years a week ago, and I totally understand that ""crushed"" feeling in your chest. Just remember to breathe and concentrate on the good moments. Take it one day at a time, and as you mentioned, keep her alive by telling your fondest memories of her to friends and family."
Petloss,3bvvis,GEARHEADGus,3,Thu Jul 2 16:02:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah probably the hardest part is all the little things she used to do. I'd introduce her to people as my pain in the ass (trust me I love her to pieces) cause she would always beg for food or throw her toys down the stairs etc. Her big thing was deli meats, pigs in a blanket, pizza crust and French fries. So eating those was pretty hard without her. But um its gotten better yknow. Ive got way more good memories with her than bad. And I keep looking at it like she had 12 years of great health and being a spoiled brat and my best friend, compared to the one week she was sick. What really gets to me was just seeing her like that, yknow, sick. She was throwing up, in pain, but we tried to keep her as comfortable as possible until Monday when her vet opened. Luckily she only got extremley bad Sunday night. Sorry if this seems like I'm rambling."
Petloss,3bvvis,CorporateDroog,3,Thu Jul 2 16:20:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. It's really hard, but yknow you can message me if you need someone. I've been told I'm a good ear."

My buddy died just over 2 years ago and some of the things are starting to slip out of my mind. I NEVER thought I would forget even one little thing about him, but time passing is funny that way. Writing things down recently has brought a lot of tears, but also so much joy and love for him.   I'm so sorry for your loss."
Petloss,3bvy4l,CeeMulls,2,Thu Jul 2 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"You did a lot of growing up in that time. I'm not surprised you're having a hard time dealing with it.  I got a cat when I was 23. Let's call her Joe. She passed away after I had her for 17 years (she was 4 years old when I got her). I still miss her terribly. I have dreams where she's alive again, and I get to pet her and just generally love her.  Some context: I had many, many cats growing up. About 5 years after getting Joe, I got a companion for her - Charlie.  And while I loved Charlie immeasurably, I never had the same relationship with her.   Charlie just died this morning in my arms. I miss them both so much in different ways."
Petloss,3bvy4l,mybrilliantmind,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:53 2015 UTC,I am sorry to hear about Charlie. It is so surreal to think about how cats just have such distinct personalities. It makes sense but I never really thought about it until I got Oaks.
Petloss,3bw2cz,Dumbledore27,2,Thu Jul 2 16:56:04 2015 UTC,I'm glad you have so many memories. Matty sounds like he was great friend and a wonderful companion.  It was a wonderful thing for you to welcome him into your home. I'm sure his life was filled with happiness.

I know it's hard when people around you don't understand how deeply your grief runs. And granted, some people can't seem to comprehend the fact that these babies aren't just pets to us, but are members of our families. Just try to remember that your feelings are valid, and there are a lot of us who feel just as strongly and are cut just as deeply when the loss of a kitty or other furred family member occurs, those of us who know exactly how devastating such a loss can be.  Treat yourself with kindness,  /u/LawyersWig, and remember that your little guy knew he was loved. Gentle Passing, Little One."

You find out about him getting hit, no pain but confused.  He passes on.  He misses you.  You take more time to accept that he is gone.  You miss him.  You and him both realize he is somewhere else - pawing your face through a window.  Days, days, days.  You think about petting him and you don't cry.  He sits down and purrs from your pets."

Petloss,3bsc4k,HelloThereEarthling,2,Thu Jul 2 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"We lost our 15 year old friend 11 days ago.  The first few days are obviously the worst.  I would accidently say the same things for or about him - especially after coming home from work.  ""Oh, that's right.  He's not here anymore"".  His life influenced my vernacular.  The next few days were reaching over to pet him subconsciously in bed, hearing sounds that had the same pitch as his voice, making sure I check behind my chair before rolling it back to get up.  Now it's a lot of positive dreaming, which helps curb the sadness when I wake up.  I can look at pictures of him without crying and miss him more with a hint of the happiness he gave us.  Very cliche - I know.  But to echo some of the sympathetic comments that helped us these past 11 days, it gets better."
Petloss,3bsc4k,MyUsernameRocks,2,Thu Jul 2 02:54:32 2015 UTC,"Just lost my best friend of 13 years yesterday and this comment really hit home with me. It's a process, one that you can never be prepared for. We must all stay strong together. I loved your words. I deeply thank you for them."

We couldn't afford to get a bunch of tests, but the vet guessed either Lymphoma, or liver disease, or stomach cancer. I got his ashes and clay paw prints too. Hang in there. It gets easier. Just remember all of the good times you had with Lady Chubs."

Petloss,3bm4dh,bjem26,2,Tue Jun 30 09:29:52 2015 UTC,"So sorry for what you're going through.  A few years back we had to put a cat down for a tumor on his arm that just wouldn't stop coming back, so I can understand your frustration.  Just last week another cat of ours died unexpectedly.  I had only taken her to the vet an hour earlier where we discovered she probably had lung cancer.    Losing a pet totally sucks.  Putting them down or simply losing them; both feel awful.   But I've been reminding myself (and my son and husband) to really focus on every good memory instead. Every time I start to miss her, I try and remember happy times.  And there were so many, as I'm sure you have with yours.  They loved us and we love them still.  That's the important part."

Petloss,3bm4dh,AntiDrugs_encourages,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:10:29 2015 UTC,Thank you for all the kind words it helps me to feel a little bit better.
Petloss,3bm4dh,filteritgreen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:41:38 2015 UTC,"I speak the truth when I say I know how you feel. We had to put my cat of 12 years down last Thursday, 6/25. She started vomiting, unable to keep anything down. She was drinking excessively and hiding in places she would never normally hide. We took her to the vet and had some lab work done, and found out one of her kidneys was 2x the normal size. We took her to a specialist and they performed an ultrasound and immediately put her on treatment. We got a call back saying that the signs were pointing to either Lymphoma or a Kidney Virus. We put her on more medication to try and fight whatever it was, but she just wasn't responding to the treatments. The doctor said dialysis was an option, but that it was a rare procedure, especially for cats her age and she didn't think she'd survive. We came to visit her and talk with the doctor, and I was so distraught. She looked so miserable, and when I held her, she was shivering and shutting down. We decided a euthanasia was the best thing for her. We came back later that afternoon, along with my sister and mother. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I don't think I've ever cried so hard in my life. She was my baby and I loved her more than any pet I've ever owned. I was lucky that I was able to hold her in my arms and kiss her goodbye. It still hurts, and I know it's going to take a while to get over her. But like AuntieChiChi said, try and focus on the good memories. I made a little ""tribute"" video with pictures and video clips; it's helped me cope and concentrate on the countless times she made me smile. This poem I found has also helped:   ""You no longer greet me, as I walk through the door. You’re not there to make me smile, to make me laugh any more. Life seems quiet without you, you were far more than a pet. You were a family member, a friend, a loving soul I’ll never forget. It will take time to heal- for the silence to go away. I still listen for you, and miss you every day. You were such a great companion, constant, loyal and true. My heart will always wear, the pawprints left by you.""  May both of our cats Rest In Peace <3"
Petloss,3bm4dh,MyUsernameRocks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"You did the right thing.  We had to face a similar decision 11 days ago.  Bean wouldn't have wanted to go through all that.  You did the right thing making the tough decision.  That's what friends are for.  Edit: When my wife called me at work crying and saying, ""I don't think you quite grasp the situation"", I went home.  I started crying thinking ""but why today?"" ""Are you serious that's what the vet said?"".  Then it hit me...  He was on the bed with me and jumped off only to fall awkwardly on the ground.  I both lost it emotionally, and knew it was time.  We all did the right thing."

Your love for her lives on and that is what you should bear in you like a medallion of honor.You see,you were one of her reasons to live ,so she rests in dignity because your love for her lives on and that will never change but you will love her for as long as you live.

You carry her with you wherever you go, she loved you, you know this, and you would know she would want you to grieve for her passing, but also cherish the beautiful life you gave her. All those fun memories and times you spent with her will carry you through life, and her along with you.   She may be one of many in your life, but she will always be special to you, because she was yours, and you were hers.   Its a bond many may not understand, but who cares, its what you know and feel that matters. People may scoff and say its just a dog, but those people have never felt the love and affection from a friend like that.

Petloss,3bh8wn,shayter,3,Mon Jun 29 05:09:18 2015 UTC,"It's hard when life hits you like this. 20 years, you will agree, is not a small change. But your memories, you and him, will forever be yours. He will live in peace, pacing around in your memories, and he will be happy so long as you're happy. You can bet that's what he wants : he's best friend of twenty long ones to be as happy as the day you guys met. And who's to say there will never be another meeting between you two? Fact can be stranger than fiction, but I also think the advice from u/LaustinDWoods is one worth agreeing with too. Find solace and comfort with the others that you love. Immerse yourself with their presence, and hopefully you'll also find peace with the inner presence of your old friend. And as unbelievable as it may feel right now, hold on to this as well : it will hurt less, and it wont be as crushing when you've come to terms with him simply moving residence, and that is into your heart."
Petloss,3bh8wn,erdmanatee,2,Mon Jun 29 07:02:00 2015 UTC,"I am sorry for your loss.  Try to focus on the best memories that you have of him.  Although he is gone in physical form he will always live on in your memories.  He lived a good life and he has you and your family to thank for that.  For dealing with the grief, talk to as many people as you can about him.  Tell the best stories that you remember and let yourself become emotional in front of people willing to listen.  This helped me so much when I lost my cat.  You have made a big step by posting here and sharing your story.  You are not alone in this."
Petloss,3bh8wn,LaustinDWoods,2,Mon Jun 29 06:28:35 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss. When I lost my kitty of 15 years, I found some solace when a friend told me that there was nothing she could say that was going to make me feel better. What she meant by that was that when you lose that personal relationship with your loved one, that your grief is as inmense and as personal as that love you shared. It's SO very hard being grateful when we suffer a loss that cuts as deep like this, but between moments of itense grief, know that you were so incredibly fortunate to have shared this great love and relationship  with your kitty. It truly is a beautiful thing to love another living being that much.   It has been a couple of months for me now, and there are days where I'm still a wreck (right now specifically, while sharing this with you!). And that's ok! Never feel like you should ""be over it"" at ANY point. But remember that the love that you share is eternal and will stay with you until you are no more. I personally think that's very special. I wish you the absolute best. You are not alone."
Petloss,3bd5qf,FizzFoxFaxen,5,Sun Jun 28 02:30:44 2015 UTC,"My good man, a grown man or not a grown man can never deflect from the pain that comes from losing a good friend. Scratch that, a good friend may sometimes not be enough a term due to how we normally think of the word. Think of your Beethoven as a tenant of your heart, now. You and him would have shared the grandeur of life, with memories only you two share and own. It reflects a better time passed, but don't be bogged down thinking it's all past, for you may never know when you'll find him in your heart, alive as ever. And happiness may soon fill that day :) (be strong buddy! The feels will past, but having experienced some myself, I know it will always feel uniquely painful. Be strong!)"

I got Leo about a year after Chief crossed the Rainbow Bridge and while he has brought love and laughter into my life, he's not a replacement for Chief. I miss Chief still, but having Leo helps ease the pain. Beethoven had a good daddy with you and I know he loves you and is no longer in pain. Cuddle with Kissy. She will be feeling his loss too. Comfort each other. The pain won't go away completely, but it does get better. You'll be able to look back on your time with Beethoven with fond memories."

Petloss,3b405l,diggalicious,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:02:54 2015 UTC,I just experienced the same thing last Friday. It is definitely an awful thing to go through when you are an animal lover. Dogs become part of the family. It does get better little by little. Reflecting on the good memories seems to help too
Petloss,3b405l,maeamaezing,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:49:28 2015 UTC,"I lost my baby 6 days ago to lung cancer. I never knew she was sick. About 3 weeks ago she started what we thought was a cough, then the labored breathing started, after many vet visits we tried to treat her for other things it could be but she continued to get worse not better. It wasn't 3 weeks ago she was playing, begging for her dinner at 3pm when she had breakfast at 8am (lol) then all of the sudden she just got so sick and it's cancer, she was only 8......I can't sleep, having a hard time eating, she is my first baby that was mine and I am just wondering how long it takes before you even start to feel any kind of peace and don't cry every morning..............."
Petloss,3b3k9z,headcanonftw,2,Thu Jun 25 18:02:45 2015 UTC,I'm sorry for your loss. Sundog sounded wonderful. I'm so glad you found each other and she got to experience real love. X x
Petloss,3b3k9z,Yummilyspam,2,Thu Jun 25 21:44:04 2015 UTC,"She's in puppy heaven now chasing butterflies and kitty cats. As she fell asleep her last thoughts would have been filled with lots of love, your hugs and being snuggly and warm.  Big hugs xo"
Petloss,3b2y5k,LeviPerson,2,Thu Jun 25 15:21:18 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is a horrible thing my friend, don't dwell on what you should of done. Instead cherish the memories you and her have together. Be strong, she will need you to be.  I lost my best friend in January, and I think back on all I could of done for him, but I couldn't afford it. Every night I tell him about my day, and it still pains me he is gone.  She's in pain, and the life she could sustain with the meds might not be the life she wants. Nor can it be a guarantee she will not be suffering.  If you ever need to vent or someone to listen, just shoot me a pm  So sorry for your pain."

I won't forget my lil buddy but it does get better, I promise."
Petloss,3b14f4,ramaloki,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:09:25 2015 UTC,Oh gosh I am so sorry. That is not your fault. How is your relationship with your dad? Can you communicate about your pain and get some insight from him about why he let the cat get so bad?
Petloss,3b14f4,BlackMantecore,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:04:01 2015 UTC,Our relationship is fine. Not super close but we aren't distant either. I never told him how I felt and at this point not sure if I could. I assume because he was going through an unwanted divorce that he just didn't want to take the time to make sure she came inside every night.
Petloss,3b14f4,BlackMantecore,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:58:50 2015 UTC,"I hear you. My beloved kitty died of cancer and I felt like it was my fault because she wasn't feeling well, yet I thought that was just kind of normal for a cat her age and didn't get her help until it was too late. But the reality is we do the best we can with our circumstances and with our knowledge and that has to be enough."
Petloss,3b14f4,LaustinDWoods,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:56:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss. You made the decision that you felt was right at the time and left your cat in the care of someone that you trusted.  There's no shame in that.  It sounds like she may have gotten sick from something beyond even your dad's control, something in the environment around your dad's house.  Cats usually don't get that sick if they are outside, even for an extended amount of time.  There wouldn't be any stray cats around if they were that fragile.  This was not your fault.  There was no way that your moving away had anything to do with what happened, it could have happened even if you didn't.  Please take solace in that you were able to be with her in her last moments and remember her as the great kitty she was."
Petloss,3b14f4,Turtles2460,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:55:10 2015 UTC,Thank you. She holds a special place in my heart and it just sucks missing her so bad after so long.  I just wonder what made her so sick so fast like that. Thinking back I'm not sure if taking her to the vet would of cured her but I wish I could of tried.
Petloss,3axwjp,tmactherizza,2,Wed Jun 24 11:31:37 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss, but I'm glad to hear that Sprocket had such loving owners who gave him a good life."
Petloss,3axf55,SilverClover44,3,Wed Jun 24 07:22:23 2015 UTC,"The best thing you can do is be there for your sister and let her know she's not alone. Be there for his brother-it's going to take time for all of you to learn to cope with them not being in your lives and the best thing you can do for right now is be there for each other and not be afraid of sharing in your pain. Spider Robinson once wrote ""Shared pain is lessened, shared joy increased. Thus we refute entropy"" so make sure you're as kind to yourself as you can be and that your family knows you're there for them. A lot of times when people lose someone the instinct is to grow apart and lose yourselves in your pain or run away from it but while everyone handles pain in their own way it's important to be there for each other.   You have my condolences. Please know you're not alone and that if you ever need someone to talk to you can note me. Remember-the pain will fade eventually and you'll have lots of good memories to share. For now be kind to yourself and each other. Perhaps a play date with your pups brother. Bring them out to a dog park to meet some new friends. It won't replace their brother but it may help them cope, too."
Petloss,3axhhu,SoughtArbiter,2,Wed Jun 24 07:55:36 2015 UTC,Be kind to yourself and find something to keep you busy. The absolute best thing you can do is love yourself as much as you can and be there for others. It doesn't have to be in this sub. You could volunteer at a shelter or perform some random acts of kindnesses in their honor. Take up some kind of craft and/or create something either in their honor or that will make someone smile. Your friend brought you a lot of happiness and their memory will once the pain has worn off a little but until then keeping busy will give your brain something to do so you won't focus on the hurt so much-not that there's anything wrong with hurting. Don't be afraid to cry because a lot of times letting it out helps a lot.   Know that you're not alone. If you ever need someone to talk to don't hesitate to note me.
Petloss,3ax3bu,SpaghettiJunction,3,Wed Jun 24 05:03:21 2015 UTC,"I just lost my best buddy this morning, just 7 hours ago. Her name was Jade, a staffordshire terrier. She could barely get up and had troubles making it outside for bathroom breaks due to her age and health problems. Had her since I was 11(27 now). Had such a strong bond with her. I have been crying for the past 2 weeks knowing that the time was soon. So damn heartbreaking to have to make that decision to end your good friends suffering. When nobody else was there for me, she was. So I made sure I was there for her as well, including during the end of her life.  16 years of memories I wouldn't trade for anything.  We chose in home euthanasia which I felt was the best thing for my girl. I wanted her to be at home with her family comfortable and not in some alien environment with weird smells that could cause her more stress. I was cradling my girls head at home and talking soothingly to her as I heard her breathe her last breath and watched her eyes fade to grey. Hardest thing I have ever done. But I know deep down inside, I made the right choice. I could not stand to see her suffering so much, struggling to breath, collapsing in her own urine, and losing everything that made her a happy dog.  My thoughts go out to all of you who are mourning the loss of a best friend."
Petloss,3ax3bu,goatmutation,2,Wed Jun 24 23:14:37 2015 UTC,My condolences. Thank you for doing your best to be there for others despite your pain. Know that you're not alone. You can always note me if you need someone to talk to.
Petloss,3ax3bu,ziddersroofurry,2,Wed Jun 24 09:42:12 2015 UTC,I went through the same exact thing not even an hour ago. It's comforting to know that she is in a better place. My condolences to you
Petloss,3ax54n,mylastredditaccountw,2,Wed Jun 24 05:23:50 2015 UTC,My condolences. I don't suggest getting a pet right off. Give yourself some time to grieve then once the pain has lessened some decide on whether another pet is right for you. All too often people get pets when they're depressed and grieving for one that has passed on only to discover things weren't working out. For now love yourself as much as you can and let yourself have time to grieve. A great way to feel like you're helping out and keeping busy is volunteer at a shelter or help promote animal causes. Helping others deal with their grief is another option though that depends on if you feel you have the strength to do so.
Petloss,3avd2k,TheRandomWolf,2,Tue Jun 23 20:22:21 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss. :(  I'm gonna put down my dog on Thursday, but I don't think you can even prepare enough."
Petloss,3avd2k,diggalicious,3,Tue Jun 23 20:45:52 2015 UTC,"This may sound weird, but take a moment with your eyes closed to feel your buddy, to pay attention to the way their fur feels, how it feels in your fingers, in your palms, with and against the grain, immerse yourself completely in that feeling, that one sense. Then do the same with the way they smell, and sound, it's weird. I wanted to remember my buddy with every sense I had, my thought was that it will put his memory in more parts of my brain. I miss my guy dearly and late at night when my heart hurts for him, I remember him in all the ways and he doesn't feel so far away."
Petloss,3avd2k,pull-a-tune,2,Wed Jun 24 04:40:03 2015 UTC,"Make sure to try and spend his last moments with him as much as you can and as well as you can, and I wish you the best of luck dealing with it, as it even made me shed a few tears. ;("

Petloss,3avy1o,twanky,2,Wed Jun 24 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"Again, my condolences. I know it's really hard but it will fade over time and while it will still hurt it won't hurt as much.

It's terrifying to be in that sort of position even when you can rationalize it. Once your friend is gone there will be no more fear and no more pain. You're doing the right thing. Please know you're not alone. You can always note me if you need someone to talk to.
Petloss,3avg99,ziddersroofurry,2,Wed Jun 24 09:39:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. I've been thinking about it today and it's gonna be a relief both for Wilma (my dog) and me. It's been a strange weather today and I've been thinking ""what if a thunderstorm is coming"" all day, and it's making me very tired. It's gonna be good for her to go, but it pains me so much to come home because she's happy and seems fine. But the nervousness around thunder and heavy rain is very painful for her. It's summer in my country and that means a lot of rain and thunderstorms. I'm gonna take her out now for our last walk in the forest. Can't even think about it without crying. :("

Petloss,3avg99,ziddersroofurry,2,Wed Jun 24 20:20:45 2015 UTC,"Now it's done.  But when we got to the vet my sister called ""DON'T DO IT!"" is what she screamed on the phone to my mom. She said she would take her. She had her for a few years when I was away to uni, but she got a kid and the dog and the kid was too much so I've had the dog since. Their kid is 2,5 years and she's getting a new baby in 3 weeks! Would not be a good idea to have a new born baby, a 2,5 year old son and a nervous dog at home. But after a talk to my mothers boyfriend, my sister and her boyfriend agreed to put her down so we went into the vet, and I held her paw till her last breath :'( I'm doing surprisingly OK, but I'm sure the shock will hit me after a while. Like tomorrow morning when she's not here and after work when she's not happily greeting me at the door. :( it's kind of a good feeling that she won't suffer anymore, but it's sad for me and the family that she's not here. :( I miss her deeply."

What helps, however, is to have a memento of her. You can do what we have done with some of our pets in my family: bury them in a planter with a plant that comes back after every season. You'll be able to take her with you when you move. We did this for my older brothers cat when she passed 10 years ago, and we did it today for mine. Having them immortalized in such a way helps you understand that while they may be gone physically, they won't ever be gone from your memory."
Petloss,3arwc7,The_LuftWalrus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I have been through this too. My 15 year old companion of a cat passed disappeared one night and has been assumed dead since, and I absolutely didn't expect it. It happened when I was at a very low point too, and it is devastating. Try to remember the positive memories and not dwell on the negatives and if you want to really get through it, start writing down those good memories, it will help you process things.  It takes about a year to recover from things like this. I am thinking of your Comrade too."
Petloss,3arwc7,LauranceFuller,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:58:44 2015 UTC,"My heart goes out to you. It was very hard when I lost my Ibizan hound, Shiner back in 2011 but the pain does fade. I think the hardest part wasn't the loss but when I began to recover and didn't think about her as much but she's still there. I have a paw print I took of her plus pictures and I often tell people about her. By keeping your friends memory alive and doing little things to celebrate them you'll help keep them alive in your heart and continue honoring them. For now don't be afraid to cry and grieve and know that you're not alone. There are a lot of people here (including myself) who are more than willing to talk to you if you need someone to talk to."

Petloss,3amv6y,maeamaezing,2,Sun Jun 21 19:57:08 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. The thing about dogs and cats is that they're so stoic, by the time they start exhibiting signs of illness, it's more than likely too late. Dogs and cats are officially old at seven, and it's important to have biannual checkups rather than annual.   I learned this the hard way when my 11-year old rescue golden retriever collapsed in the kitchen. I took him to the vet and did radiographs and found his liver full of nodules. An ultrasound revealed a liver and spleen full of cancerous tumors. We had no idea because he acted perfectly fine until the collapse.   I say this not to make you feel bad, like you did something wrong; you didn't. I was a vet assistant, and I had no idea.  My sister's dog died much the same way. In her arms at the vet, waiting for her useless ex boyfriend to show up so we could euthanize him. By the time he got there, he had passed on while my sister held him and cried. And then the douchebag had the nerve to accuse us of euthanizing the dog without him. The kicker? We later found out why he'd been so long in getting to the vet: he wanted to finish his golf game first.  So it's not as if you didn't try. You were held up because of a job, not because you thought something else was more important. Do not blame yourself. Having your dog die like that is sad, but please remember this: your dog died in your arms. He knew you were there, and he died surrounded by love. That's all we can give them in the end, and you in no way failed him.   Anonymous internet hugs to you. I am sorry for your loss. Cherish those memories!"
Petloss,3amv6y,Nikkorkat,0,Mon Jun 22 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"Im very sorry. My dog died on friday as well. He was also in a lot of pain. His brain was swelling due to meningitis.  If I knew what i know now i would have had him put to sleep 3 days earlier. Im heart broken. His last days sucked so much, he spent 2 of them at the vet. He was on medication but it did not help. It was awful.   I try not to think about the last days. I go though and look at pictures and movies of him and it helps. I thought it would make it worse but it helps to see how happy he was. Some of the pictures make me laugh and it cheers me up a bit. Its only been 3 days but the crying fits are getting shorter. Its just so hard to believe he is gone. He was only five."

Petloss,3akxre,ShadowStarshine,3,Sun Jun 21 05:23:57 2015 UTC,"When I lived with my parents, about 6 months into moving into a rural area in Texas we lost 2 cats to coyotes.  My dad regretted buying the house he was so sad.  It's really hard not being able to say goodbye, and not knowing 100% sure what happened.  My dad wondered for weeks what happened to his little friend Butler and cried for days.  They ended up getting more cats after I moved out and put a fence around the house so the Coyotes can't come in.  We haven't lost anymore animals like that again.  If you do decide to adopt again and let the kitty outside, a simple chain link fence should keep the cyotes out.  They lock the gate at night now specifically so they can't come in."

There could come a cat into your life that needs a home, that no one else wants, who needs you and melts your heart.  If you don't want a cat that will ever go outside again get a feline leukemia positive cat, or felt cat, because they can live healthy lives but get out down in shelters because no one will adopt them.  I have one and I love him so much.  Just a thought for one day, when and if you're ready"
Petloss,3akxre,XOGhostKitteh,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:26:24 2015 UTC,Just wanted to thank for the comment again it did help. Did you dad have issues of guilt over the incident? I'm having troubles getting past that..
Petloss,3akxre,XOGhostKitteh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah he did.  He let the cat outside at night in the back yard.  He wondered if he had put him in the front yard if he would have been safe?  Or if he had a fence to keep coyotes out (he does now).  He also said he felt like as the man of the house it's his job to protect those that love there, especially little helpless animals and he failed to keep them safe.  Said he had wished he moved closer to the city where there's be less cyotes, regretted a lot of his decisions.  He went back and forth with these feelings for a few months, and would bring it up a lot.  It's been about 4 years and he still brings it up sometimes.    At the end of the day we had a drought and the cyotes were hungry because their normal food group was dead (rabbits, that sort of thing) so they resorted to ️cats, which they normally don't eat because they aren't as nutritionally beneficial.  It wasn't his fault, but he still blames himself."
Petloss,3akxre,XOGhostKitteh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"I really relate to a lot of that. I also feel like I failed at my job as a protector. Did his get taken in his backyard as well? It happened so close to where I was yet I heard nothing. It pains me to know I was physically so close to the place it happened because if I had knowledge it was happening I could have gone and fought them off, DID something to protect my cat.  I'm really grateful you share this with me, just to know there is someone out there who cared for their animals like I did mine who feels the same way. Thank you."
Petloss,3ak6dd,OhLookAnAirplane,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:17:57 2015 UTC,I'm glad you got to be there for her in her last moments. I don't know if animals comprehend the concept that they are going to die but they love having us by their side.
Petloss,3ak6dd,ShadowStarshine,0,Sun Jun 21 05:26:23 2015 UTC,Im really sorry for your loss. I am going through the same thing right now. My dog died on friday. I cry about it all the time. Its just awful. The crying fits are getting shorter though. Time heals everything. Just remember the good times. Looking at old photos and movies of my little guy seems to help cheer me up. He was so happy and that makes me happy. I hope that helps. Again i am very sorry. This just sucks.
Petloss,3ak6dd,Sixstringkiing,2,Mon Jun 22 05:31:22 2015 UTC,"I broke down big time again today. I went in to pick up her toy and collar, the vet who was with her from the beginning ICU stay came out to talk to me. Along with that, I had to call and make the plans for her cremation. It was tough, but it's already getting easier.  Even the vet receptionists started crying when I walked in, she was quite popular up there. You know something special has been lost when it's even difficult for those that barely know her, and that's helping me by just knowing that she was such a great dog."
Petloss,3ak6dd,Sixstringkiing,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:22:00 2015 UTC,Yea I went to the bank by my house today and all the ladies there looked like they were going to cry when they saw me because I walked my dog past the bank everyday and a lot of them knew me and met my dog. For me the mornings are the hardest. I also picked up a few toys ive found and cried real hard today.

You're not a loser, you gave a wonderful cat a good life, and I hope you heal with time too.  What was your kitties name?  I talked to my sister who went with my dad to the vet to euthanize him, and apparently when he realized what was happening he mustered his last big of strength and tried to run away but he couldn't get up because of his illness and his head just banged on the table.  Broke my heart.  She said if he had been successful in standing up she would have called the whole thing off but he wasn't :/."

Petloss,3ai636,TyGunth,3,Sat Jun 20 15:46:03 2015 UTC,We just lost our 16-year old girl that my wife has had since she was just a small kitten.  My wife is flip-flopping between numb and torn as well.
Petloss,3ai636,Caddan,3,Sun Jun 21 02:52:32 2015 UTC,"I lost my 15 year old 10 days ago.  It was among the worst decisions I've ever had to make.  We are humans. That means that we have to make decisions that are humane. We choose to keep them from suffering.  Your beloved friend was 19. That is really old in cat years. I'm saying this gently, as a friend. She was not going to live a long time anyway. If you had not performed the procedure, she would have lived a little while, but soon enough, she would be gone. You can't blame yourself for making the wrong decision. Either decision ends the same way.  My best friend relied on me for love, companionship, food, water, a roof over her head, a clean litter box, and playtimes. Later, she grew to need medicine for her high blood pressure and iron deficiency. Then the kidney disease really took hold and she lost a lot of weight suddenly. So I took her in religiously every two weeks to get a bag of fluid. Eventually I learned to do it myself at home. She never wanted for anything, and had a wonderful life. But when she started to go downhill, and couldn't walk, and couldn't make it to the litter box, I had to make the humane decision to not let her suffer.  If I had done nothing, she might have lived another week, or maybe just days. Or maybe years? But she would have been miserable and suffering every minute of it.  The thing that really tore me up was that she was totally alert and lucid. Her body failed, but her mind was still active. So I held her and made her feel safe at the end.  She was my best friend."
Petloss,3ai636,bananapeel,3,Sun Jun 21 07:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you had to go through that... It only last 2 days with Kim, with no pain at all, and it was hard, can't imagine what you went through...  What's tearing me right now is the loss, her absence. Seeing her little bed, the cardboard she used to sleep in these days, checking if everything's alright before going to bed and kiss goodnight but she is just not there. That's the hard part now."
Petloss,3ai636,bananapeel,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:02:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I have another cat in the house, so of course we kept all the food dishes and water and litter boxes and so forth. But the places where she used to curl up (I always kept lots of blankets and sweaters around for her to make nests) I kept a few of those sitting out after she was gone. Eventually I will wash the cat hair out of them and put them away, but right now it's just too painful."

Petloss,3aa5rp,swespn,6,Thu Jun 18 13:12:18 2015 UTC,":-(  I recently went through the same thing with my old beagle, Aunt Bea. She was almost 20 years old. She lived a great life. At the end, she had some big problems and her back legs were paralyzed. She couldn't walk. She was obviously in pain - yelping all the time.   We took her to every specialist around and got the same answer: ""There's nothing we can really do for her.""  I knew when it was time. She had no more quality of life. She'd become incontinent and was getting infections from that. I couldn't bear to see her suffer any more.   So we made her final appointment with our wonderful vet. He assured us that we were doing the right thing. I knew that, but it didn't make it any less painful.   Even our vet was openly weeping as he gave her the shot. He'd know Aunt Bea for a long time and really liked her.   I managed to hold it together until we got back to the car - where I sobbed uncontrollably for what seemed like an hour. It felt like I couldn't breathe. And I'm a 44-year-old man. It's normal to cry. Sometimes, like now, it's a very healthy thing. Let it out. They call it a 'good cry' for a reason.   I'm not going to be one of those people that says 'everything is gonna be okay' - because it's not. You've lost a loved one. It hurts. It sucks.   You'll learn to accept it in time. You're left with many wonderful memories, I'm sure. Your friends and family will all understand why you're a little down. It's okay to mourn for a spell.  Gradually you'll accept it. You'll smile again. You'll laugh again. You surely don't think so now, but you will open your heart up to another pet again.   Now is just the hard part. It gets easier. You know that, but now and then we all need to hear it from someone else.   Mourn in your own way and hang in there."

We brought her in for a checkup two days ago, since she wouldn't eat and was really tired all the time.. The vet wanted her in to open her up yesterday, and he called around 5 to tell us there was nothing to do and that he didn't wanna wake her up. We came in to say goodbye and it was the hardest thing a have ever done in my life.. I loved her so much, and the fact that I grew up with her and couldn't remember my life without her makes it worse.. I feel like talking to people in the same situation helps, so if you wanna talk I'm here for you. This is a really hard time and I'm having a hard time realizing she's actually gone.."

I guess looking back there have been tiny signposts all along the way... many I chalked up to aging or didn't think much of. In the last few days he stopped eating, and this morning I went to pet him and he made a cry as if just touching him was painful. We already had the vet appointment and I already knew there was a chance I would come home with an empty carrier.  What I wanted to tell you though was the moment of peace in his eyes. The process is two shots, the first being a sedative, and yes it is incredibly sad but for five minutes he was the most peaceful that I have seen in a long time. Like he was just waking up or dozing off on the most incredible nap. It made me realize that this was the end of a downward progression, and it was the right thing to do.  I too worry that I have lost something special, a once-in-a-lifetime bond. I feel a bit better that I did not watch him die slowly and painfully. I just wanted to tell you that, in between the tears, there is a strange peace about it. And I am glad I didn't stretch it out much longer."

Petloss,39rcf6,ziddersroofurry,2,Sun Jun 14 21:16:04 2015 UTC,My condolences. I think I can offer a little insight into this. Not only have I lost two dogs to epilepsy before I myself am epileptic and have been since I was little. You can find more info in this thread http://www.crazymeds.us/CrazyTalk/index.php/topic/1627-can-a-seizure-kill-you/ but to sum it up it could have been the result of them not getting enough oxygen due to shallow breathing. It also could have been a side effect of the medication. Whatever the reason you did the absolute best you could for them and you gave them all the love you could give. If you're still able to I would have an autopsy performed as it could help give your vet and other vets more information about both your dogs condition and the reason for their death. It sucks to lose a friend and my heart goes out to you but at least some good may come out of your loss that way.
Petloss,39qjhj,Scrantonbornboy,4,Sat Jun 13 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"I just signed up for Reddit to answer this post :)  my golden cocker spaniel went to sleep on Tuesday 9th June. He was my best friend, and also had to be put down because of kidney failure. He leaves me and his little black cocker brother behind.   In terms of hierarchy, they were the same as yours. My experience so far is to try and keep the routine the same as before, let you and Josie feel your grief in your own ways. Remember in a dogs brain, losing a pack member is exactly that. A loss, and a weakening of the pack. Dogs are resilient though, and will adapt in time. It's more likely there will be some change in Josie's behaviour going forward as she/he adapts to the new structure. Just make sure she/he gets her walks, eats her food and gets a couple of extra pats and hugs because you're all sad.  Hope it gets better for you all"
Petloss,39qjhj,sandli0n,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:34:56 2015 UTC,"My cat, Jack Daniels, was VERY depressed after my dog, Buddy, passed away. Although they didn't grow up together, they bonded pretty quickly after about a week after Jack and I moved back home.   I spent even more time playing with him and he was definitely more cuddly than usual. He was kind of independent before Buddy died almost 5 years ago. Now he wants to lay on my mom all the time. I was surprised at his personality change so that might be something to look for as well.   I found that it took him a while to adjust to becoming #2 in terms of hierarchy in our house. I just gave him time to adjust and he was better after a few months."

If your dog is lonely (mine is, now that his best friend is gone) you could try taking her to a dog park. My dog was quiet and sad after we put down my other dog, but a few months later when we brought him to the local dog park we really saw a difference. He was happy again, and running/playing with other dogs. He missed his playmate, his friend, his walking buddy.  :( I do too"

My babyboy Steaky had to be put down on July 17th, 2012 and I think about him (and tear up) still at least 3-4 times a week. A loss is a loss, whether human or animal.   Patches death was not your fault. You gave her a great life, something you can't guarantee if you hadn't adopted her.  Just don't forget about all the good times you had. Focus on those during rough bits. I like to watch videos and look at pictures, but even if you don't have that, no one can steal your memories.   Cry, get out the emotion, and shift your focus to the good stuff. No one here is judging you. We understand. :)"
Petloss,39ekih,glacinda,3,Thu Jun 11 14:49:15 2015 UTC,"very big hugs  I'm sure if God let's animals talk in Heaven, the first thing she would say is ""Thank you for loving me!""  You gave your heart and a part of your life to a non-human being, who accepted that love and gave back her own love. You chose her and she chose you, a true family.  Even when everything is long gone, and there's nothing to record anything that happens in the universe, the time, love, and bond you had can never be undone, it's eternal, even now. :)"

They flat out said she was just a dog, and it was a ""he said she said"" matter. It turns out that when it comes to your neighbours, you really have no protection from them other than moving away. And selling/moving takes time.  I'm not a violent person, and I will not break the law. So I have no recourse. I've done what I can to inconvenience her without antagonizing her, and I hope to sell my house to a family with lots of kid, or dogs, maybe some musicians.  She's a complete psycho, her actions are beyond irrational and I'd rather not put my remaining dog, cats and family in undue danger."
Petloss,399vnl,TyGunth,3,Sat Jun 13 17:56:25 2015 UTC,Do what you can to lower their property value without breaking the law. You mentioned maybe selling to musicians? Perhaps in the meantime you can take up the drums.

I had to make the decision to put him to sleep. The pain is still very raw for me, and just about anything can trigger a tear session. Writing this is making me well up with tears. I had him cremated last Friday, and I'm waiting to pick him up. I'm probably going to blubber then as well.  Just like you, I replay the last moments of his life, and it's something I can't control. The whole psychological mind trip around his death gets me. He's here one minute, and gone the next. Even if it was peaceful for him.  While I still cry, I have moments of just thinking about my dog, and it's not too bad. I feel a little more at ease to laugh at the things he used to do. He was a silly dog.   I think the important thing is to remember them the way they were -- as we would any other family member -- and understand your grief is complicated for the moment. Just go with the ebb and flow of your sadness; don't try to deny it.   In the meantime, come here and talk to those who understand your grief. ::hugs::"

Petloss,38xfmz,baldylox,2,Mon Jun 8 00:51:25 2015 UTC,"I second guessed myself on putting my dog down. At home, he was far worse than what they saw in the clinic. He couldn't breathe, climb stairs, and stayed on his bed all the time. This wasn't the dog I raised or knew. He was old, tired, and his health declined. I thought for a while I killed him, but his worsening heart condition would only have gotten worse.  It's never easy for those they leave behind. There never is an easy way to prepare for it. Wait too long, and you wonder if they suffered. Do what's right and wonder if it was too soon. There is no rule book, but I believe it's better to not have suffered.   It's been a week since I lost my boy, and the pain is still very real and raw. You're in good company here. Continue to talk if it makes you feel better, cry, and maybe reach out to another who is experiencing the same pain. I did, and I feel a little better."
Petloss,38xfmz,baldylox,2,Mon Jun 8 01:53:16 2015 UTC,"I recently went through something similar with my ancient Beagle. She was in a similar way - in constant pain and crying all the time.   They let us know when they want to go. They're smart like that.   You did the right thing, OP. Inside I'm sure you know that, but it doesn't make the grief any less real.   Losing a loved one can take a lot out of you, but it's also something that we all learn to accept in time. I'm sure you already know that, too - but sometimes it does a lot of good to hear it from someone else."

Petloss,38vraw,Hildaelisa,2,Sun Jun 7 06:46:17 2015 UTC,"I would contact the network. Tell them about this negligence. This wasn't your puppy passing away from a bad reaction to anesthesia or something that there was no way you or them could have done to prevent. Just don't sign anything, if they ask you to sign, saying you won't press charges. Chances are if they're asking you to sign that, they did smething you could sue them for.

I just lost my Hooper last Friday, and I told everyone it feels like he took a lot with him when he passed. Most notably, a part of me.  If it's any consolation, try to remember the good times. Cry if you must, and don't put a time limit on it. Murphy appears to have had a very regal lifestyle. That is something to be joyful about.

I know what you're experiencing, and it's difficult. I had to put my boy, Hooper, to sleep last Friday, and I woke up today saying I couldn't believe it's already been a week since my boy has been gone. One of the toughest things I've ever had to do. My life, home, and overall existence is not the same. In fact, it feels bland and sad. I hate going home not to see my dog or hear him snoring next to my bed at night.  As I write this, I fight back tears because it's a long, hard road. The grief is terrible, but we have to remember we gave them the best life possible. And if we could instantly remedy them to full life and vigor, we would. To release them of their suffering here -- even if it means our hearts will suffer tremendously -- means we loved them dearly as they did us.   Grieve for your dog. Cry and do whatever it takes to get out the tears. Come here, talk about your sadness, and talk about your dog. It does help. Remember the good times. ::hugs::"

It was the single hardest thing I've ever had to do. He was so central to my life -- his mannerisms and personality were so dog-like. We would play a game where I hid treats around the house and he would run around trying to find them.  I've been in shock because he was completely fine up until last weekend when he suddenly refused to eat. He was about 16, and the vet x-rays of his abdomen showed fluid build up... they thought he might have cancer. I didn't want to see him suffer or get to the point where he was refusing all food, so I made the decision to euthanize. Funnily enough, he still wanted to play the treat game right up until the end even though he was wobbly and slow. Broke my heart.  I don't believe in ghosts, but it feels like he should still be here... that he's just behind me waiting for a head scratch or to play a game.  I wish I could take your pain away. I've found writing down the happy memories and mannerisms he had really helps, like I'm preserving him because I know the feeling of his presence will fade with time.  I encourage you to do whatever you feel is the right thing for you. Know that your dog loved you deeply, that you gave her a full and vibrant life. You were the best dog-parent she could have hoped for."

Petloss,38glxd,mangotank,3,Thu Jun 4 01:58:39 2015 UTC,"I'm terribly sorry for your loss. It's apparent you truly loved your dog, and she brought you many, many wonderful memories. There is a lot of love from those photographs. I enjoyed your album.  I know what you're going through. I lost my Hooper on May 29, and it's still very difficult to be in my home. It's not the same, and I suppose it won't be for quite some time. Everywhere I look is a reminder of where we walked, a place on the floor where his bed was, this is where he laid in the sun, and this was his favorite toy. I haven't even taken his blanket out of my car after the day I took his to be released of his pain. What's worse is I blamed myself for his death, actually saying I killed him. It's only been recent that I've come to terms with what I know really happened to him and that the clinic I took him to did not truly examine him. His heart was failing him. He couldn't climb stairs anymore, he didn't eat -- even the most expensive organic wet dog food and chicken & rice couldn't do anything for his hunger -- and he couldn't do any activity without getting winded. Overall, I had a very depressed, sick, and withdrawn dog.  In the moment and looking back over your life with them, you do what is best for them. It's never an easy decision, and it will hurt like hell. You know your dog better than anyone else, so when you know they are not experiencing a quality of life you deem exceptional, you can't allow them to go on.   I believe pet owners should take comfort they made a selfless act of love. You want your pet to be around you as much as possible, but they won't be any longer after that. You know your home and life will be emptier, more plain without their comfort and presence.   Hurley looked to be a happy dog. She seemed content, judging by your pictures. Mourn her loss, but do not be sad over her life or her getting cancer. I'm sure she loved you as much as you loved her. There is no doubt, and she probably thanks you for sparing her the discomfort and prolonged agony that accompanies cancer.  I'm sorry I went on a tangent in the second paragraph, but I'm not sure I could convey how much I know your pain without giving some backstory to mine.  In the meantime, be close to those who knew Hurley and also understand your loss. I have been frequenting the Pet Loss Reddit page as I find it helps with the sting of sadness, and others actually know and care about how you feel. Like I am now, I give comforting advice because I know it so well and it helps me with my loss.  I still cry all the time, but I am proud of Hooper's life and the time he was with me. Hopefully, you can do the same."
Petloss,38glxd,Hooper84,2,Thu Jun 4 11:06:16 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry for your loss with Hooper...Am feeling an all too similar melancholy as you. Like Hooper, Hurley loved being out in the sun too and I look at the spot she would usually be in only to see nothing there. Shortly after I have to think about another topic or else I get too emotional. Moving her beds, food bowl and blanket downstairs the other day was an incredibly daunting task yesterday for the family.   Ha don't worry about going off on a tangent! It was a very tear jerking read :). Hurly was a great dog and from the sound of it so was Hooper. He was very close to you and you were very close to him. There was one person he would trust to make such an important decision: You. Hooper suffering from a heart disease must have been such a horrifying thought to be confronted with . Making that final decision...no words of mine can describe the pain you must've felt. In the end, take pride knowing you didn't let Hooper suffer another day.   Thanks for such a heartfelt comment, it really helps. I have my fingers crossed  the two of us can finally come to terms with what happened to Hooper and Hurley, being able to move on. I agree, reading and talking to others such as yourself on pet loss has seriously helped. I will continue to do it.   Thanks again for all the advice :,)"

Petloss,38glxd,AntiDrugs_encourages,2,Thu Jun 4 15:58:21 2015 UTC,She was beautiful !! Never let death change what she was in life ! You were her reason to exist as a pet ! This should mean that a part of her life is still here and that is you ! The doggie of that timespan you had her ! RIP Hurley :-(
Petloss,38hgla,pullacatengo,2,Thu Jun 4 06:09:54 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss.. And especially the way you had to witness it.. I cannot help you with any advice on this, but I do think that at least the fact that Hutch was in your arms gave him a sense of peace. And try to think of all the time you DID spent together and cherish those. I hope this can give you some comfort."
Petloss,38hgla,gizm0mar,2,Thu Jun 4 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"Hello. Last February a similar event happened to me and my best friend. My dad decided out of all times to leave the garage door open in the early morning (some lady late for work or was in a rush was speeding). Funny thing is that I have never seen her before. She clearly did not live on my street (I've lived here quite some years) and I have never seen her car before. What a perfect alignment of events, right?  I cannot get rid of the image. Unlike you, I did not get to hold her for her last moments. A 7 lb chihuahua mix....By the time I got outside she had already passed.  I feel that we, who have these images imprinted into our minds, have the hardest time moving on. I just get filled with rage when I think of what happened. I still sometimes wake up early in the morning afraid it would happen again to my other dog. It's such a terrible thing to go through.   Unfortunately I don't think we will ever be able to forget what happened. I'm still trying to get over the feeling of guilt, but hopefully you are beyond that. I cannot comfort you as I am still suffering. Just letting you know you're not alone."
Petloss,38hgla,tdatran,2,Fri Jun 5 09:20:09 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry for your loss. I understand the guilt and anger...  I also have no solution but thanks for sharing. I know it's awful and at least I know I'm not crazy for not being able to let it go yet. I hope one day we can stop seeing it. Good luck to you.
Petloss,38hgla,Strumpette,2,Fri Jun 5 11:54:59 2015 UTC,"Personally, I believe these kinds of losses are the most difficult because they happen so suddenly and without warning. Last night I let my cat out who is mostly an indoor cat but enjoys going outside for an hour or two and comes right back inside. I knew something was wrong right away because he didn't come back in before I went to bed and I was restless and didn't get much sleep at all. This morning, we found him on the side of the road and he had been struck by a vehicle and was already gone.   This is obviously still very fresh for me but I don't see this pain going away any time soon, especially with the guilt that hits you and the unnecessary questions you ask yourself that no longer make a difference either way. I know they can be daunting, but letting go of these questions and the guilt you feel is definitely a step in the right direction towards moving on. The images you see in your head are also very difficult to deal with but I hope you find some comfort in knowing that at least you were with your best friend until the very end and that in itself is priceless.   I loved my cat more than anything and it makes me teary just typing this because I already miss him so much and he was only 3.5 years old, so I also had a very short time with him that should have lasted much much longer than it did. The only thing I can do now though is think about all the funny stuff he did, how happy he made me while he was here, and be grateful that I had him in my life at all, even if it was for just a short period of time. I really hope you can find peace as well, and remember your buddy the way he was while he was with you and know that accidents do happen but that doesn't mean you ever stopped caring for him and I know he still loved you just the same as he ever did and nothing could ever change that."
Petloss,38fo30,questionableaction,2,Wed Jun 3 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"Am so sorry, I just lost my pet that I grew up with recently and am having trouble coping. Be proud of yourself though, you were Angel's go to comfort! :)"
Petloss,38fo30,mangotank,3,Thu Jun 4 02:01:08 2015 UTC,"It brings me some comfort. I tried my best to make her last days better. I shared more of my food with her, including cheese, milk, ice cream.   She was always a bit of a quiet cat, but I'll notice her gone tomorrow when I don't hear her asking for her breakfast, or when I walk in after a long day of work.  I never thought I'd see her pass away. I'm serious too. I grew up in a christian household and I heard all the time from pastors that the world was coming to an end soon.tm I never thought I'd be separated from my beloved animals.   I sorely wish I could've been there in the end, and I wish I could've been there to lay her to her final rest in the earth."
Petloss,38fo30,GrumpyCatSwagg,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:09:42 2015 UTC,"I just lost my dog Tuesday. I had her since I was 13 and now I'm 27. She would of been 15 in a couple weeks. It does hurt when I wake up in the morning and she's not there to greet me. She was a good dog, loved to be petted by people and would never beg for food but simply stare at you until you gave in and let her have some. I feel for you, and know you're not alone with these feelings. Mornings for me are the hardest part of my day. I usually keep the tv on and let the noise fill the house. My family has been feeling sorrow as well, we all loved her deeply but we know she's at peace now and no longer suffering. It gives me some peace knowing that."
Petloss,38daub,GrumpyCatSwagg,2,Wed Jun 3 13:59:30 2015 UTC,Lost my Penny on wednesday. She was also 15. I'm sorry for you (*your) loss :(

Petloss,38etko,sunshinecunt,2,Wed Jun 3 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your losses. I'm sure that each and every one loss is deeply felt and it seems like you have a very sensitive and perceptive dog who joins you in grief. The positive is that you have a close friend who you do not need to explain with words how difficult each loss can be, and yet, the challenge is to be supportive to him an and his needs during this time, which I'm sure is difficult for all.  If your dog is ""an animal lover"" as you describe, maybe you can find your local dog park and even doggy playgroup play dates on meetup.com (http://dog-play-groups.meetup.com/)  This way, you don't have to commit to owning an animal, and yet, you and your dog get the benefits of companionship and all the fun associated with it. Much like we as humans need to express our sorrows as method of therapy, your dog can find much needed help with playing with other dogs.   Best of luck and hang in there!"
Petloss,38etko,lucuma21,2,Wed Jun 3 21:29:14 2015 UTC,"Oh that's a good idea for sure. He's so picky about making new friends, but there are definitely some local dog parks he's enjoyed in the past. Hopefully visiting will lift his spirits a bit."
Petloss,3877ku,KeithiusCensura,3,Tue Jun 2 10:07:01 2015 UTC,"I grew up with 2 cats, Wilbur and Charlotte, named for the characters in the novel Charlotte's Web. Wilbur came first and he was great! A fat, happy indoor cat. Charlotte, though, was different for me. She was the runt of the litter, all black, and we kept her in a large room on our second floor for the first couple weeks. I was the first one to get up every morning to go in her room and find her, usually sleeping under the radiator. She and I became best friends, and for the rest of her life I was her favorite person. Wilbur passed away at 16 years or so, from cancer if I recall. That was really hard, but I had Charlotte still. We moved to a new house, and my bathroom counter had a faucet that made it easy for her to drink from, so now every morning the ritual became a drink from the faucet while I got ready for work. Charlotte started losing weight and in her old age was frail and slow, and my parents had gotten a west highland terrier named Arthur (who is a fantastic little dog, still living) so she never really went down from the second floor of the house. I had to start lifting her up to the faucet for her drink. I discovered my parents had started doing it for her too in their bathroom. She just loved fresh tap water. We found out ultimately that she had some kind of lymphoma or something, her body wasn't producing enough white blood cells, so if she got hurt or scratched, it wouldn't really heal up.  I gave her a big hug and a kiss before my dad took her to the vet for the last time.  My wife and I have a little buddy now named Walter. He's half Siberian husky and half American Eskimo dog, just turned 3 years. He is our world and when he is gone I know I'll remember him for the rest of my life. We have plans to get a second dog within the next couple years.  All I can say is, having Roscoe was so great, why waste any time being without a little buddy? You're never going to forget Roscoe, but it will stop hurting. And even after it stops hurting, you're going to remember how much it hurt to lose Roscoe, especially considering the circumstances. But cats are great! And so are dogs. So you should go get a new kitty, who will have a new and different personality and friendship, and who will always remind you of Roscoe."
Petloss,3877ku,eternallymystified,-1,Tue Jun 2 13:01:26 2015 UTC,Suggesting a new pet only a few days after a loss is not good advice. No one wants to hear that or think about another cat while they're still grieving.
Petloss,3877ku,josh6499,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss. Your story made me cry to hear. I'm so sorry that those people didn't respect the life of your kitty more. I'm glad you gave him a proper burial. Just try and remember the good times and realize that for him, you gave him a wonderful life and his time on earth may have been short but it was happy."
Petloss,3877ku,cantst0pw0ntst0p69,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your loss.  I know how hard it is, I lost my dog of 15 years in a similar way, hit and run driver.  The pain of imagining his suffering is with me every day, as is the guilt of feeling like I didn't protect him.  It's not your fault.  Time is the only thing that dulls the pain.  Although, initially I turned to alcohol for that.  These friends of ours bring us so much joy and meaning to our lives, it has to hurt when they leave us."
Petloss,3877ku,fudabushi,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you lost your lovely cat. Please don't feel guilty, you say yourself that he really wanted to go out and you were as careful as you could be. Accidents happen, in the home as well as outside, and this was a tragic accident. Please think about what good life your cat had. He was deeply loved by you & he had your parents for company too, so he had a happy time with plenty of variety and fun which is just what cats like. I bet he loved to wait for his hug and get it.  It will take a while before you can let go of the pain and focus on the happy memories, but it will get easier with time. Doesn't help much just now, I know.   I wish you all the best and hope you will remember: Roscoe was a lucky happy cat and that's because of you."
Petloss,3877ku,slinkimalinki,0,Tue Jun 2 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"A short exciting happy life is more of a blessing than a long dull life. He lived the life he was destined to live, as unfair as it seems."
Petloss,3877ku,josh6499,0,Tue Jun 2 16:30:09 2015 UTC,You'll move forward in your own time. It's going to hurt for a while. It's been 2 and a half months since I lost my cat and I still have to fight tears when I think about him in public. I still cry sometimes when I get lonely without him by myself at home. Sorry for your loss.
Petloss,386v9k,DagonPie,3,Tue Jun 2 07:28:04 2015 UTC,What matters most is that you gave him the best life possible.
Petloss,386v9k,RickMuffy,3,Tue Jun 2 07:34:59 2015 UTC,I hope I did. Me and my whole family. He never went unnoticed. He was always the center of attention because he was a big goofball. And he loved scrambled eggs and the beach. I say that's a pretty solid 9 years. Haha
Petloss,386v9k,RickMuffy,3,Tue Jun 2 07:39:05 2015 UTC,"I remember my first dog growing up, we called him shadow because he would follow me everywhere I go. He died unexpectedly from an allergic reaction in the night. I like to think that he went peacefully, and that our times together are never forgotten."
Petloss,386v9k,Hildaelisa,3,Tue Jun 2 07:43:52 2015 UTC,Go take pictures with your dog! I wish I had a pawprint of my cat before he passed away to have it tattooed on me later (just a suggestion).   It's quick and painless. Be there with him.
Petloss,386v9k,OMyGaarrgghh,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:17:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for the suggestion and the support :) I took a few pictures but he's not very photogenic right now for obvious reasons.

Petloss,386v9k,ohhwerd,2,Tue Jun 2 10:48:16 2015 UTC,I just had to put my baby kitty (7.5 mos old) down yesterday due to a fast moving diagnosis of FIP (diagnosed only 9 days before). It was really really hard but I was able to spend the whole last day with her wrapped up in my arms. I still cried my eyes out but it was the right thing to do and I am forever grateful for having the chance to say goodbye. Sending you all my love.
Petloss,386v9k,ohhwerd,2,Tue Jun 2 16:20:44 2015 UTC,I'm really sorry to hear that. Thanks for the support. I feel the best thing to do is spend as much time with them and love them. So you did the right thing. Much love.
Petloss,386v9k,ohhwerd,2,Tue Jun 2 17:25:15 2015 UTC,I took modeling clay and made a impression of my big dogs paw before I took him to the vet  So sorry for your loss op
Petloss,386v9k,ohhwerd,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:02:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the support. I've heard that. I think my mom is doing that. His paws aren't very big though so we won't need much clay haha. He's very grumpy right now so we'll see if he lets us.
Petloss,386v9k,September15Bride,2,Tue Jun 2 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"I made 2, because I wasn't happy with the first.   my big guy just kept looking at me like ""wtf are you doing""  but a few times since I let him go, I've gone down to touch it and just feel his paw again.  Take a few photos before you go, I took a bunch, but still feel like I didn't get enough. These ones still gets me - Last Paw Print Took this after coming home from the vets, and Last Car Ride, Took this the night before I took him, he loved it"

Petloss,386v9k,AlwaysDisposable,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:52:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah his vet and my mom asked me to hold him because no one else can. I'm nervous. But when he wouldn't even eat some steak out of my burrito I made, I knew it was for the best."
Petloss,386v9k,rezachi,2,Tue Jun 2 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"My guy went into liver failure due to a tumor on his kidney I think it was.  Took him to the vet, but I couldn't afford the surgery, and there was no guarantee if successful, he would survive / his lifestyle would be changed.  Vet told me give him whatever he wants, if he can eat it good.  He didn't want his dog food anymore, but I made sure he was taken care of. His last 2 weeks he ate better than I did. But then he stopped eating anything and he let me know it was time, that he was ready.   I can understand you being nervous, this is one of those times in life where you have to do something you don't want too."
Petloss,387e7i,Hooper84,3,Tue Jun 2 11:31:58 2015 UTC,"I should also mention this is taking a toll on me with my depression. Everywhere I look, I remember that's where we walked or he used the bathroom. My bf made me take up his belongings at home, but I can't remove his blanket out of my car. I keep replaying him being there with me one minute and not getting up the next. I also keep thinking of where he is now while I decide if I am getting him cremated."
Petloss,387e7i,slinkimalinki,3,Tue Jun 2 12:13:40 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you lost Hooper. I don't know if this will help, but I had kind of the opposite thing happen: I bitterly regret not having our cat put down a day sooner: the vet rang in the evening and told us there was nothing more they could do but my husband couldn't bear to let go and begged to wait until the morning. They kept him at the surgery and in the morning, he was obviously in pain and I felt absolutely awful since I hadn't known it had got to that point. I have felt guilty ever since.  The reason I'm telling you this depressing story is to show that sometimes it feels like there is no right answer. Hang on too long and they could suffer: have them put down before they suffer and wonder if you did it too soon.  I think the right answer is you have to decide based on what you believe is best for them. You know your pet better than anyone so vet advice is useful but you are the best judge of when enough is enough. It sounds to me like you tried very hard to do what you could and you loved and encouraged your dog, you gave him invalid food, all the right things.  You loved your dog enough to something incredibly painful for you that was the right thing for him. You acted from love and kindness and I sincerely believe you made the right choice. Our regrets and our pain come because we loved our pets deeply. And when you love them that much they know it and it makes them happy. There is nothing they want more than your love, your praise, your attention. Hooper got that.   Your dog had a wonderful life and a compassionate death. You were a perfect owner. Be sad because that's normal grieving, but please stop blaming yourself. You did everything just right."
Petloss,387e7i,allryuken,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:34:22 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. Your thoughts are exactly what I need to hear.
Petloss,387e7i,eriksworldof,2,Tue Jun 2 17:07:56 2015 UTC,I am sorry for your loss.  I am sure Hooper knew how much you loved him and loved you just as much.
Petloss,3863qw,Ocrin,3,Tue Jun 2 02:57:40 2015 UTC,That's a horrible way to lose a pet.  Pets can be more than just animals. They become part of your family and are a companion during the good and the bad times in life. The best thing you can do is be there for your cat during his last moments and being thankful for the time you had together. Sorry for your loss.
Petloss,3863qw,itisalltoomuch,3,Tue Jun 2 10:08:48 2015 UTC,"Always treasure the intimate relationship you had with your pets. I used to think they were just animals, and in no way were they as significant as people. It's just not true. My dog was always there for me: when I was broke, alone, depressed, and during my good times. In no way have I ever had that kind of loyalty come from a human. So yes, mourn the loss of the pet and the relationship, and don't let anyone else minimize the grief. They are significant to you, so that is what matters."

Could have been many things, but regardless of the cause, I am so sorry for what you went through, what your dog went through, and for your loss in the end.   If it's any consolation, I suspect there was probably nothing you or the vets could have done for her. How old was she?"
Petloss,3802vn,anastrophe,1 point,Sun May 31 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"She was only 2.5 years also (same age and birthday as my nephew, also happened to be his best friend too).  The hard part, for me, is how quick it all happened. I barely had enough time to cope with something being wrong before I had to process that she died. I mean, we were planning a hiking trip for Wednesday just this morning and this afternoon we were being asked what we wanted to do with the body.  Edit: apparently she had an extremely high temp so even if they could stop the seizures and what not she wouldn't have been the same with a temp that high for so long."
Petloss,3802vn,drebot,3,Sun May 31 23:39:25 2015 UTC,"She overheated somehow and that cause brain damage, hence the seizures."

Petloss,3802vn,drebot,3,Mon Jun 1 12:55:13 2015 UTC,We didn't get an autopsy because we just didn't want her body to go through with it. I don't think it was insecticides or anything as we don't have any in the house. And we haven't sprayed any outside of the house either.  I've racked my brain trying to figure this out but I don't think I ever will.  Thanks for the well wishes :)

I'm right there with you. For me, it feels like I'm grappling with the mind tricks death plays on the mind. I am still hurting from the loss of my dog. The whole idea of he's here one minute and gone the next complicates my grief and emotions. It is a psychological mind trick.   My dog, Hooper, didn't just die. He was a significant part of my life, and was there for many, many life changes. When he died, I feel like he took a lot with him. All the changes I went through that he endured with me are final. They are really gone. Sorting through our grief is what will see you through. At least it's what I'm trying to do."

Petloss,37wbl0,simplywhitney,10,Sat May 30 23:02:01 2015 UTC,"It's not your fault, please don't blame yourself. I think actually what you are experiencing is emotional trauma because the situation was taken completely out of your hands and you feel helpless. And that sense of not being able to instantly make it better or even being given a chance to fight the good fight is what is disturbing you.   Your parents (not to lay blame, because shit happens) were at the forefront of the situation and ran the results. If it was just you on your own, you may have tried something different; in all likelihood it still wouldn't have helped -my mom had a cat who was hit by a car and ended up with a similar injury and I can tell you that there was nothing the vet could do except euthanasia... and the way your parents handled the situation it simply came to that same end in a quicker manner (which shortened your friend's suffering).  It is a terrible way for such a great friendship to end and it will take time for you to heal.  You are experiencing a form of PTSD. And honestly, if you feel the need to go to therapy for a little to learn ways to cope, that's perfectly reasonable. You had a bond with your friend and a tragic accident occurred; people go into therapy for less.  But make no mistake, it wasn't your fault.  It was a tragic accident, you are not psychic and couldn't have predicted it. And even if you took charge of the situation to prevent that gunshot, I think all that would've happened is the same result with a needle at the vet. And with an injury like what you describe, unfortunately even your presence would've have been of comfort to your buddy. He was probably in shock and not really cognizant of much beyond what happened to him.  I am truly sorry for your loss. But you are not to blame for it and it's ok to heal. Playing the situation over and over gives you a sense of doing something, but all you're doing is ripping off a scab. If you have trouble stopping, you should go and get some help. Your buddy doesn't want you to be miserable."

I am a lot better than I was, but it's moments like now where it's all hitting me at once, and it's very overwhelming.  I'm so glad I found this sub."
Petloss,37wbl0,jezebel1970,3,Sun May 31 04:11:48 2015 UTC,"WOW--firstly, I am so sorry--I cannot imagine the pain you are in.  Secondly, give yourself a break--you could not have known.  You did nothing wrong.  Thirdly, the end may have seemed brutal to you (it would to me) but was probably kinder than prolonging it.  Please just take care of yourself, remember Oogy and all of his wonderfulness, and do what you must to heal yourself.  Best of thoughts to you"
Petloss,37wbl0,MrBlahman,2,Tue Jun 2 07:24:39 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss. Try not to blame yourself...they were almost certainly right about a vet not being able to do anything. Kitties are just so small compared to cars. That your parents were able to put him to sleep without a torturous car ride to a foreign vet that would have resulted in the same fate probably saved him a great deal of suffering.  I know none of that makes it easier, but just know there was nothing else you could have done. Hang in there!"

I could see that you were crying you found it hard to sleep.  I spoke to you softly as you brushed away a tear,  ""It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here.""  I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea,  You were thinking of the many times, your hands reached down to me.  I was with you at the shops today; your arms were getting sore.  I longed to take your parcels, I wish I could do more.  I was with you at my grave today; you tend it with such care.  I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.  I walked with you towards the house, as you fumbled for your key.  I gently put my paw on you; I smiled and said, ""it's me.""  You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair.  I tried so hard to let you know, that I was standing there.  It's possible for me, to be so near you everyday.  To say to you with certainty, ""I never went away.""   You sat there very quietly, then smiled, I think you knew...  in the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.  The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning  and say ""good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning.""  And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,  I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.  I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.

Petloss,37taut,samderpinson,2,Sat May 30 08:27:16 2015 UTC,I just wanna say something..i can only imagine how hard it must've been for you especially when putting her down was not your choice..Grieving for your dear friend is okay..but please do not misdirect the unhappiness towards your mother to the poor guy who just entered your life.. Poor guy wouldn't have a clue why you don't like him...
Petloss,37taut,samderpinson,1 point,Sat May 30 08:35:33 2015 UTC,"No. I love him so much, I really do, and he knows it. My anger is at myself more than anything. I hate him when he pees and my mother says it's alright, he'll grow out of it, we'll train him. Because that's one of the main reasons she put down my cat. But I never show my anger to my dog. He's sweet as pie and I could never truly be angry at him."
Petloss,37taut,MFNGhostAI,1 point,Sat May 30 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're going through perfectly. I lost my sweet boy, Pippin, on April 24th, five weeks ago. It was a month before his birthday/gotcha day - the day my little heart-soul kitty strutted into my life. I wake up reaching for him and when I remember he's gone it's like losing a piece of my heart all over again.  I can't even count the number of times my boy listened to my sad ramblings and let my tears wet his soft fur. I miss everything about him and always will, until the day we're reunited again at the Rainbow  Bridge.  I have so much darkness in me right now. Anger at myself for not praying harder, not seeing the signs that he was ill, at being unable to help him any better than I did. Rage that the Universe took my baby from me. Depression so deep that getting out of bed takes a Herculean effort. I question myself, too. Wondering if, by trying so hard to keep my baby with me, I caused him pain or loss of dignity.  Sometimes we can only do what feels right at the time. there isn't an instruction manual. Your girl knew and still knows that you love her and that you did the best you could for her. She forgives you...  you just need to find it in your heart to forgive yourself.   And as /u/samderpinson said: You will meet again on the other side. We must all take comfort in that.  My heartfelt condolences to you, /u/GriefTooStronk and Gentle journey, little one. May you be free of pain, healthy, lighthearted and as playful as you were as a kitten."
Petloss,37tm89,CarbonxGuitar,1 point,Sat May 30 07:52:14 2015 UTC,"Our cat's behavior was always strange, from the day we got him as a kitten. Feral cats can be like that. All of the normal warning signs were, to us, his perfectly normal behavior for the past 14 years. By the time he had his first seizure, his stomach cancer had metastasized to his brain. I didn't get to say goodbye, I was away at school. Sometimes there isn't anything you can do. My condolences on the loss of your feline companion."
Petloss,37ulua,highpressuresodium,3,Sat May 30 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss. And yes, this is definitely the right place to post questions like these. In my own experience the loss of a brother cat was filled with ease by another kitten. The older one accepted the new addition to the family in a matter of days. But in the end the decision is yours to make, we can only provide you with our own experiences. I hope mine helped you a bit."

But as soon the older one understood that the little one was going to stay with us he adapted quite quickly. I hope that this helps you a bit :). And again, I wish you, your family and your cat all the strength in these hard times."

Petloss,37swzc,transdermalcelebrity,2,Sat Jul 4 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"He looks like a sweetie, I'm so sorry you're going through this. My heart goes out to you. Earlier today we had to put down our 14 yr old kitty (he was our youngest... he had been fine until a few days ago and then got suddenly very ill). I have also had to put down 2 other senior kitties (both aged 16 at their respective times).   I agree with you, I think it's best to be there. My husband's childhood dog was put down by his parents while he was in college. He did make it home and was in the room at the vet, but one of his biggest regrets is that he was standing behind the dog so the dog couldn't see him during the final minute.  Today when our kitty passed, he was on a blanket, sitting in my lap, head snuggled into my hand, while my husband, 8 yr old daughter, and I were all petting him and talking to him. He was so comfortable he almost fell asleep before they gave him the first shot (which makes them euphoric and sleepy). His last sights and sounds were of us. And while we all will remember that sad moment, we've already started reminiscing about the better, happier times with him and even remembered a few things from long ago that hadn't come to mind in a while.  It sounds like your dog has been sick for a while, and your family has been able to plan. This is a blessing because it's a really hard decision to make when you're still in shock that it's happening.  As far as it being your birthday... yes, it is a sad event for your birthday but in a way it is also an honor. Your dog loves you and gets to spend his final minutes with you on a day that celebrates you. My husband's dear grandfather passed away at 12:05 am right on husband's birthday. A dear and close family friend passed away on my birthday. Yes, they were sad moments, but it gives our birthdays a little extra significance and we can remember the happy memories with these loved ones on our birthdays. It's a kind of bond.  I know it's definitely hard and kinda scary if you haven't been in the room before, but I would never give it up. I felt like these kitties were my friends, and at the very least I'd be there to hold their ""hand"" and give them comfort in any way that I can during their final moments.  I am so sorry for your impending loss. It's going to hurt and be hard. Bring a tissue box. If the vet is decent they will give you whatever time you need with your pet both before and after the event to say your goodbyes. After he was gone, we just took turns holding him, and then my daughter and I positioned him comfortably on the little bed so it really looked like he was sleeping.  We even stuck his paw out (because he always slept that way). It gave us as much peace as we could possibly get from a difficult situation, and I wish you that.  {{{HUGS}}}"
Petloss,37swzc,Hooper84,2,Sat May 30 03:45:46 2015 UTC,"i apologize that my reply is late - i wanted to message you after he passed. thank you so so much for the kind words, i hope you can feel my gratitude from here. i would refer back to your comment over the past few days in my most difficult moments. it really helped me tremendously.  i am so sorry for your loss. my thoughts and love are with your family. Koda passed similarly. he was very well behaved with the vet (a first, haha), was very peaceful and in my lap while i held him. he left us quickly, he was ready to rest. myself, my boyfriend, and my parents were all in the room with him when he passed, it was a beautiful moment that i'm glad i didn't give up.  thank you again, so much :')"
Petloss,37swzc,transdermalcelebrity,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:48:09 2015 UTC,"I just read your post. I am terribly sorry for your loss. You need to grieve as much as possible as I feel it honors their life and relationship they had with you.   It's never an easy decision. Our pets bring us joy, comfort us in our weak moments, and  remain a constant in our lives up until the end of their lives.   I put my wonderful Hooper to sleep on Friday, and I'm having issues dealing with his absence. While he lived a spoiled life (thanks to me!) and a long eleven years, it doesn't take away from the pain I feel in my heart. I feel a part of me has died with him, and I can't reverse the decision as much as I'd like to.   We have to remember the good times and that we cannot replicate such a deep understanding and relationship with anyone else or animal. They are all unique. While you may go on to love another -- and hopefully at some point we all will -- our pets will always be apart of our hearts."

But I'll never know. It's actually not the first time one of my cats has found a new owner.  I had another cat who was Tippy's aunt (Him and her looked a lot alike though I have no pictures of her) and she adored me but hated everyone else. The house was so busy because, ya know, three young kids, a dog, other cats, and she was a loner type of lady. One day she ran away and then would show up around the neighborhood every once in a while. Came to find out, she moved out of our place and then moved into an older couple's place who only had her as a pet. I was quite happy she found a home she felt happy in.

My dog died this morning and I also have nobody to talk to about it. But worse, I was out of town and came home to find him lying on the kitchen floor. Spartacus was the best dog I've ever had and he was like my kid. He got me through a lot of stuff, my mom being diagnosed with a terminal illness, a divorce, and a move across the country. He was there for me through everything, and now I feel like I wasn't there for him in his final moments. I am devastated, completely beat down. I miss Sparty so much. I feel like I lost my child, my best friend. I just want to hug him again and play with him and tell him he's a good boy. I love Sparty so much.  And somehow reading your post made me feel not so alone. I know other people have experienced the same thing, but somehow its not so lonely knowing that someone else is going through the same thing as me right now.

I had to put my dog to sleep a little under two months ago, and I still feel like a part of me is just missing. I haven't really found that it's gotten any easier, per se, but I am slowly getting used to being without him.   Trust that you did all you could with the knowledge that you had. You gave her a good life, and when you realized something was seriously wrong you did your best to take care of her.   We are only human. We can't see the future and it's a waste to spend time wallowing over the ""what ifs."" Even if you'd taken her to the vet right away, there is no telling that you'd have been able to do anything to help her.   You did your job. You loved her. You cared for her. It's okay to miss her. It's okay to mourn her, but don't beat yourself up about it. I don't know your dog at all, but I am pretty sure she wouldn't want you to."
Petloss,37eg1d,0dde0,2,Wed May 27 02:56:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this.  I'm not OP but I put my dog down on Sunday and it's been tearing me up since then.  I believe that I did all the things you said, but I'm still feeling the what-ifs.  If only I had more money I could've maybe done more, but I know that I did everything I was able to, and surrounded him with love all the way through the end.  You are a great person and I appreciate you helping me today."
Petloss,37eg1d,ProbablyNotADuck,3,Wed May 27 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"No problem.  I think we are often too hard on ourselves when we're in the midst of our grief. It is so easy to focus on all the ways that we failed instead of all the ways we triumphed.   I wasn't a perfect dog owner. I look back now and wish I'd taken him for longer walks. I wish I'd let him up on the couch to snuggle with me as I watched TV. I wish I'd spent the last several months of his life spoiling him rotten. But what ultimately mattered is that I was there when he needed me. I couldn't fix him, but I was there for him. Most importantly of all, I loved him fiercely, and, the last time I looked into his big brown eyes, I had no doubt that he knew that.   I still have one big, goofy dog remaining, and I am trying my best now to be as good to him as I possibly can. We go for longer walks. We snuggle on the couch. He gets extra bones (within reason) to chew on. And I am sure, once he is gone, I'll look back on a few things and wished I'd handled them differently.. but I will still know that I did my best, and I loved him with my whole heart. That's all we can do.   It hurts beyond words when we have to let them go, but that's the price we pay for being able to experience such unconditional love. I don't know if I will ever ""get over"" the loss of my dog.. but I do know that it is a pain I'm willing to carry with me for the rest of my life for the simple joy of having him in my life for the time I did."
Petloss,37eg1d,0dde0,2,Wed May 27 22:58:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your loss OP.  I too lost my best friend this weekend.  It's so hard.  But I know that I gave him a better life than he may have gotten.  He was at a pet store when I got him and he had been there for a few months.  He was scheduled to be sent away shortly after I got him, and I swore he knew that and appreciated me bringing him home.  He gave me 13 years of amazing love, affection, and companionship. As time progressed I had kids, graduated college, got a job, my life continued to evolve, and he was there through it all.  My steady foundation.  And now he's gone.  I miss him so much.  But we are still here and we have to go on.  And no matter the circumstances of our pets passing, nothing can take away the life we lived with them.  They are grateful for us, and we should be grateful for them.  Take care of yourself, everything will be ok."
Petloss,37eg1d,iliketoworkhard,2,Wed May 27 14:53:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your loss. You gave Kuma a chance at a nice long life, she passed away happy and peaceful. She gave you a lot in return too. Here's something for you:  To my dearest friend.  I stood by your bed last night; I came to have a peep.  I could see that you were crying you found it hard to sleep.  I spoke to you softly as you brushed away a tear,  ""It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here.""  I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea,  You were thinking of the many times, your hands reached down to me.  I was with you at the shops today; your arms were getting sore.  I longed to take your parcels, I wish I could do more.  I was with you at my grave today; you tend it with such care.  I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.  I walked with you towards the house, as you fumbled for your key.  I gently put my paw on you; I smiled and said, ""it's me.""  You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair.  I tried so hard to let you know, that I was standing there.  It's possible for me, to be so near you everyday.  To say to you with certainty, ""I never went away.""   You sat there very quietly, then smiled, I think you knew...  in the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.  The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning  and say ""good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning.""  And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,  I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.  I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.  Be patient, live your journey out...then come home to me.  -Author unknown"

She always nuzzled up to me when I came back to visit, and when she got to be a slow and tired old lady, she would just pur and melt into my arms when I cradled her.

It was a little soon to get a new friend, but I still have her 12 years later and she guild my heart. Go visit some kitties, even if you don't adopt one. It's always good for the soul."

Petloss,37d316,Summergirl101,2,Wed May 27 12:32:39 2015 UTC,"I understand your pain. It's been almost one year since I lost my first dog, Brandee, to kidney failure. She was only four years old. I have dreams about her all the time. I cry at night mostly when I think about saying goodnight to her. Sometimes I browse dog adoption websites thinking I will find her somewhere out there. I can't wrap my mind around her death.   After she died, I longed for that special bond between human and furry friend. I went to the humane society, and it met so many dogs and cats in need of homes. So many had been abused, broken, and sad. My heart warmed in ways I did not think possible. I thought my heart had turned to stone after Brandee died, but I was wrong. A new part of it grew and started beating again when I met a little black dog named Fletcher. We have been inseparable since. He gives me reason to get up every morning. He helped me through the toughest part of my life, and he is so grateful and loving.  I encourage you to visit your local shelter and spend some time with the cats.  I still cry for Brandee, but the pain is not as sharp. And I have my boy Fletcher at my side, giving me purpose again."
Petloss,37cvfg,MsMina,5,Tue May 26 18:24:03 2015 UTC,Sorry for your loss.  Lost my doggy soulmate 2 years ago in September.  Still sucks. But I gave him a great life. And he was 13 when he passed. A boxer. I have read that six years is good for boxers. Anything longer means they are in a great loving home.  He died when a lung mass grew in his lungs. I caught it at it's infancy. I was a helicopter dad. The options were to let it kill him or crack his chest open - possibly killing him on the table - and letting him live in pain for a couple of months. I chose to let the tumor take him. I knew it was my choice. I was going to let him die. But I knew he would die naturally and I would put him to sleep the moment the hurt was too great for him - better a day early than a minute too late.  I let him die. But I let him go with pain meds and spoiled him with treats.  It is on my shoulders.  And I feel like I did the right thing. You can't blame yourself for the passing of your friend. And forget people that say - it is just a pet. No. They are much more than that. They are friends and family.  Nature did it's thing. Don't kick yourself. The pain will recede. Your girl passed naturally.
Petloss,37cvfg,eyehate,2,Wed May 27 00:23:31 2015 UTC,I am so sorry. Kidney failure sucks. You did the best thing - you loved her and gave her a great life. Don't let the guilt eat you up. She knows you loved her and did right by her.  It has been almost 18 months since I lost my 8 year old baby to KF and I am just now able to think of her without getting choked up. It takes a lot of time. RIP Tigress.
Petloss,37dkvg,btspike,5,Tue May 26 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"I know it is hard, but try not to blame yourself. I think every pet owner feels some level of guilt over losing a pet, whether it's because we gave up too soon, or held on too long, or didn't notice something or put them thru unneccessary stress with extra vet visits.  Guilt is a normal part of the grieving process and you just have to get through it.   Cats are experts at hiding health issues until it is too late. I lost my girl to kidney failure and she even had blood tests every 6 months due to a drug she was taking for epilepsy. I beat myself up for MONTHS about missing what should have been obvious signs, if not to me, then to the vet. I think you have it right - focus on the good memories, and the bad thoughts will fade slowly. It has been almost 18 months and I finally can look at a photo without my heart clenching and throat closing up immediately.    You and your wife were loving pet owners and all we can do is our best. As long as you acted out of love, then you did good. Hugs.   RIP Stella"
Petloss,37dkvg,too_old_for_this_,1 point,Tue May 26 22:08:50 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me asking, how did the end with your cat play out? My family's cat of almost 17 years is probably at complete kidney failure, being kept alive by daily IV injections, and it's probably a matter of days until the end. We just want to put her down before she suffers but it's tough to make the final call. And I'm living 1,000 miles away, so I'm not really around to see the progression."
Petloss,37dkvg,DrSandbags,1 point,Wed May 27 07:20:47 2015 UTC,"The short version of the story is that once she went on SubQs and appetite stimulants, she went very quickly. She had gone diagnosed for a long while. When I knew she was in a chronic state and knowing that I would hold on as long as possible, I made a list of everything she loved to do. I made a pact with myself that when she couldn't do them, it was time to let her go. As it turned out, she held on for just a little over a week. Due to my issues with her vet and how horrible her last few visits were, I didn't want to have to take her back there for her final moments, but made other arrangements. She ended up dying in my arms on my bed about 10 minutes before we were to leave for her final appointment.   Making the list, I believe really was good advice. It is hard to note the subtle changes and slow decline on a day-to-day basis, I felt having milestones helped see the progression. Check out this website, it helped me understand even if it was too late to help my baby. Hugs to you and your family. http://www.felinecrf.org/"

You gave her a good life, you were just as much of a good companion to her as she was to you. Sending hugs your way."
Petloss,37759u,404NotFounded,2,Tue May 26 12:43:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the encouraging words. I've just got her home from the vets and it turns out she has a lymphoma tumour in her intestines. The vet said it wouldn't be fair to operate due to her age and already weakened state, and the likeliness of another tumour forming since this is already the second one in a year. I took the advice of the poster above to have her ethuanised at home  which will be happening tomorrow morning."
Petloss,37759u,josh6499,1 point,Tue May 26 13:59:56 2015 UTC,That's terrible. It sounds like you've given her a good life and have done everything you can. You may want to consider having the vet do a house call to perform the euthanasia in a more comfortable setting. That's something I really wish I'd done for my cat back in March because he was in a lot of stress at the vet clinic in the end.

When they brought him back to me he was so upset by this process that my last moments with him consisted of me trying to catch him as he hobbled frantically around the room, looking for a way to escape.

Once I see the Urn containing his ashes with his favorite collar around it, with his name tags, I know I will cry again, and just hold the urn like a weirdo, pretending it was him in his living state.

But I can't stop fucking crying every time I look at her. She's been with me since I was 10 like you and I grew up with her... I've come to terms with the situation but I'm just so emotional when it comes to her.
Petloss,36rk0y,WulfsigeX,2,Fri May 22 16:55:15 2015 UTC,"I feel you pain, my friend. Just do me one favor. Just spend time with her while you can. If I could go back knowing what was going to happen yesterday, I would have gone home to spend the last of peanuts time with him. Petting him, playing with him, holding him. Just be with your dog. Be there when she closes her eyes. Tell her it'll be okay. I wish I could have been there for my peanut. I hadn't seen him since February. As much as it hurts you need to be grateful that your dog was ever there for you when you needed it. It's a beautiful tragedy, I believe. I'm heartbroken that he's really gone. But at the same time I find some joy in the fact that I ever got to love him so much. That I got to grow up with him. That he fulfilled his mission of watching over my family while I couldn't. Your dog must've did the same thing. She did what a dog is supposed to, brought a love and joy into your life that you wouldn't have otherwise had. I hope everything goes well for you, my friend, and I am sorry. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to bare and as much as it hurts, it's okay, because I know peanut is on the rainbow bridge, healthy, with all the toys he can handle, with his sight and hearing back, chasing leaves and barking at shadows. He always tried to be a dog 10 times his size. He's alive in my heart. He always will be. Dogs really are mans best friend. It just stinks losing that best friend. She loves you like you love her.

It lets out so much of the hurt and shows how strong the bond between you and Caesar was. I felt the same way about my dog. Nothing ever prepared me for the pain of losing a pet.  Take the time to talk with your friends or relax at home. Gather her things and hold them if need be. But remember that you will need to move on. Maybe someday you'll find another kitty friend (not in Caesar's stead, keep this in mind) who will give you friend, love, and smiles.  For now, cry. It is never wrong or shameful. PM a brother up if you need to talk."

You and her people gave meaning to her life and that should comfort you as you mourn her and acknowledge these facts. You all were the meaning of her pethood and of her life. She should rest in peace with her full life fulfilled and she left you here thus you were a part of her life in the way I mentioned. Reddit here to help you say goodbye. RIP girl :-(

He knows it's his time and he will be much better off afterwards based on what you've explained. Cherish the last few moments you have with him and know you're doing the right thing.  RIP little buddy.

Work has a calming effect on me, feeling pretty centered. There will be grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner tonight, cooked by me, classic comfort food. Our neighbors are friendly too and they've been visiting. Still grieving, but overall there's great support."

I can relate, but I don't know to the same magnitude. I sometimes think about my cat, who I saved from a very abusive owner, and how helpless and afraid she was when I first took her in. I think of my dog who was recently taken most dishonorably by a coyote and how alone and confused he may have been. Both drum up very strong feelings - opposite feelings - but in the end I am glad I feel the way I do because it reminds me of how much I love them.  I know it's cliche to tell you to enjoy the time you have with your pet while you can. I don't know that it would help to say, but at least you know you really do love your bird - and I'm sure they know it (and feel it), too."

Abue must have had a great reason to stick around - his humans - you and your family - who loved him and he loved you back! 20 glorious years, and yeah, he's moved on and you'll see and hear him in places where you don't expect - and it will rise up grief and bite you - but each time it does,  and you are sad and even if you cry a bit - it does get better in time.  My own cat, is now 6 weeks gone after 16 blissful years - and I still see her out of the corner of my eye and hear her rattling around in the other rooms when the house is still..

Petloss,36g88g,Spiralyst,2,Tue May 19 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"Any vet worth their salt will typically provide you with this poem on a nice piece of card stock when you lose your pet.  Here's a couple of other nice thoughts I've come across on the loss of a pet that aren't as well-circulated as The Rainbow Bridge...  We may not be together  In the way we used to be;  We are still connected by a  Cord no eye can see.  So whenever you need to find me  We're never far apart  If you look beyond the horizon  And listen with your heart.  -Author Unknown  Before humans die, they write their last will and testament, giving their home and all they have to those they leave behind. If, with my paws, I could do the same, this is what I’d ask…  To a poor and lonely stray, I’d give my happy home; my bowl and cozy bed, soft pillow and all my toys; the lap, which I loved so much; the hand that stroked my fur; and the sweet voice that spoke my name.  I’d will to the sad, scared, shelter dog the place I had in my human’s loving heart, of which there seemed no bounds.  So, when I die, please do not say, “I will never have a pet again, for the loss and the pain is more than I can stand.”  Instead, go find an unloved dog, one whose life has held no joy or hope, and give my place to him.  This is the only thing I can give…  The love I left behind.  – Author Unknown"

Its tough, there is no doubt about it. You feel like your dog entrusted his life with you, and you feel like you failed him.   You didn't fail him though. Dogs don't care about tumors and long lives. They care about the moment, and they care about having fun and going on walks. Which I'm sure you gave him. You gave him a happy life that he needed. Therefore you succeeded in caring for him. You know he holds no regret towards you and so you shouldn't either."

Petloss,36fulz,frigoffrachel,1 point,Tue May 19 03:23:00 2015 UTC,"I had the same exact thing happen to me. He was an old man (7 years) when his buddy died. He was definitely less active after. We handled him more and held him often (even briefly helps) and gave him his favorite foods (he was very old anyway, I figured he might as well enjoy as much carrot and kale as he wanted. He passed away about 6 months later. I still them both, but the stinging of sadness has turned into one of fondness as time passed."
Petloss,36fulz,Spawn_Beacon,2,Tue May 19 06:51:29 2015 UTC,"My friend had 2 ferrets and one of them died. The other one was completely depressed. It lost weight and his hair was falling out constantly, soon he was on deaths door step.   I had another friend who had a ferret as well, that I was actually pet sitting indefinitely at that point because the owner had moved. So I suggested to my friend to bring hers over so it could have some company...her ferret had a blast.   After a month, my other friend was finally ready to take his ferret back and that's when we asked if he would be willing to take the other sad ferret as well. My friend was desperate for her ferret to be happy. Thankfully he did...my friend missed her ferret but it was extremely happier. It's hair grew back and it was a complete transformation. It just needed a friend.  I suggest adopting or buying a new guinea pig and seeing if that helps. At least just as a test to see if they get along and brightens up your guinea pigs life. I honestly don't know what else you could do."
Petloss,36fulz,mariahkl13,1 point,Tue May 19 06:28:44 2015 UTC,In Switzerland it's considered a criminal offence to not give a social animal a partner with guinea pigs falling into this criteria. They can die of loneliness so if you can't for a few weeks you're going to have to either keep it close to you for most of its time or get another guinea pig quicker than a few weeks. It's going to be a vital time for the little guy and you're best acting fast or the poor guy may not have long himself.

Petloss,36f7p6,rdkbdlr,1 point,Tue May 19 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it's a scenario I've considered but won't be able to make happen without serious drawbacks.  I'm living pay check to pay check as is, with enough on the side to pool anywhere from $300 to $500 into my savings after all bills and expenses per month; I could easily allocate the savings into paying for rent in even a $800-1000/mo. single bedroom apartment, but right now I'm paying $700/mo. for rent and all the utilities.  My gf and I have been planning to move in together at some point down the road but we both agreed we'd be rushing into it, and even with bills split down the middle, I wouldn't have enough to pay my full share of utilities unless I live down to my absolute minimum; then there's vet visits, dog food/treats/toys, not to mention the deposit for the apartment and having to furnish it from scratch.  It's totally beyond my means when I factor in all the little things, and I wish I could try it but I know it's unreasonable and it wouldn't help my dog out by taking him back but having no means to support him. He deserves better, which is why I put him up for adoption in the first place but the adoption center can't have him anymore due to his aggression.  I've given him everything I could, all of which has been very last minute after I had to leave him behind the first time. I wish I can do more, but the thought of him being in a home that won't accept him for his behavior hurts me more than losing him for good, and in that regard I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I have to lose him for his sake."
Petloss,36f7p6,rdkbdlr,1 point,Tue May 19 20:15:36 2015 UTC,What about looking up dog training videos or friends? Maybe they have an idea to help him get over this aggression.  I mean you would have to go there and train him or have a friend go with you or something?
Petloss,36f7p6,midnightpictureshow,0,Tue May 19 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"I've had him get obedience training with me when I first had him; he did a decent job but a lot of it was essentially tricks rewarded with treats (thanks PetSmart). It worked well enough but I didn't have the time to train him further when the relationship fell apart.  I've asked friends that I trusted but one that could've taken him fell through because they just got another rescue dog (total of 3) and had their hands full already. i don't know anyone else that could nearby and ultimately I would be giving them a big burden. Thought about asking my mom and brother but we have a very old, frail dog at home (14 y.o.) who could get hurt from my dog's excess energy.  The adoption place already isolated him and can only keep him there until this Saturday; I don't know if anyone can take him in by then, let alone indefinitely until I find my own place which can be upwards to 2-3 years from now."
Petloss,36f7p6,midnightpictureshow,1 point,Tue May 19 22:08:28 2015 UTC,This situation SUCKS.  I don't really have any advice except for bad advice; go into debt trying to save your beloved companion. It's so unfortunate that your friend is unwilling to take the dog in. Couldn't you compromise with him at all? Reassure him it would only be temporary?
Petloss,36agm7,BigPoopBreakfast,2,Sun May 17 19:33:56 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry you had to go through that :(  Take heart in knowing that you did what you could and that not all street rescues end so poorly.  Your story struck a chord with me because my black kitty was rescued by my mom from a highway. He and my other cat (who I found in a parking lot) are living cushy lives now: Imgur
Petloss,36agm7,firskey,1 point,Sun May 17 23:12:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Luckily I have proof at home that not all street rescues end up like that -- we rescued a kitten that had been abandoned under similar circumstances from essentially the other corner of the same block, but was lucky enough to find her way into the bushes, and then to meow at my wife. She is as healthy as can be, and is the happiest, spunkiest, and most affectionate cat I have ever known. I think part of what made the other day so hard was how similar the circumstances were -- I couldn't help but see my cat in the little guy.  Thinking about it in the way you mentioned does help quite a bit."
Petloss,36agm7,tsintse,2,Mon May 18 17:53:28 2015 UTC,We rescued a litter of kittens a couple years ago and cared for them while we were adopting them out.  One of them got sick and over a period of 48 hours became completely bedridden.  I ended up taking the little guy to the vet ER at 2am when it became clear it was critically ill.  After a couple hours the vet explained that there was nothing that could be done and it was best for the kitten to be put to sleep.  We only had the kittens for 3-4 days at this point but I'll tell you I cried like a 5 year old with a skinned knee driving home and I'm a 41 year old man.

Petloss,368b2w,whizliz,2,Sun May 17 03:31:14 2015 UTC,"Oh OP. A similar situation happened to me recently. My parents were babysitting my two dogs while I took my licensing exam for school. One was confined, the other one never needed to be. Parents live out in the country. One got loose, the other chased. The road is not busy, but timing was just so. Both of my little best friends were hit and died instantly.   You can't let the guilt consume you. You just can't. It eats me every day, all these ""what ifs"". But you can't do that to yourself. What would your little buddy say? Do you remember the look of pure love and pure joy on her face when she saw you walk in the door? Do you think that face wants anything but the purest happiness for you? You gave your dog the most beautiful life and that dog was so thrilled to be yours, happy and loved all day long up to the very. Last. Second. You made that dog the happiest dog in the world. I hate that she isn't with you and you can't spend time being happy together anymore. But you gave that dog the world of love and treats and snuggles and fun doggy adventures and don't you for a second think that counts for nothing.  You learned to be cautious of that fence in the future. But you can't bear responsibility for all the horrible mishaps of the universe. Sometimes it doesn't matter how many things you do right, because it can be canceled out by a single wrong thing outside your control.   The next time you catch yourself thinking about some obscure way you could have ""prevented"" this horrible accident from happening, remember that it's hindsight alone that makes you know it's the best choice. You did everything you could to make your little buddy's life happy, and even if you don't realize it right now, your little buddy always knew.

Petloss,366ie4,morosco,3,Sat May 16 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"The attacking dog's reaction (likely) has NOTHING to do with it's owners or how it has been raised.  Huskies have a very high predatory instinct as part of their breeding.  A lot of people don't know this until after their Husky starts killing all the wildlife in their backyard (rabbits, squirrels, etc). If a Husky hasn't been socialized with small pet animals while they're a pup, they often can't tell the difference between someone's pet cat or tiny dog and something it's been bred to hunt and eat.

Petloss,366ie4,midnightpictureshow,1 point,Sat May 16 19:36:41 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I hate to read this.   It's true, the laws in most states would look upon this as destruction of property.  That said, I have many, many ideas as to how to deal with someone who allows their ""pet"" to behave this way."
Petloss,366yg1,midnightpictureshow,2,Sat May 16 19:31:06 2015 UTC,I'm sorry for your loss. Losing a best friend sucks. Remember the good time and remember hes in a much better place.
Petloss,366yg1,hendrixchild419,2,Sun May 17 01:44:38 2015 UTC,I find it difficult to drum up even happy memories because those are what make me the most sad. I don't know if I'm missing something about the process or if I'm just messed up. Although I do like to believe there's a place where Ikey went where he will be happy and wait for his two buddies (our two golden retrievers)... And me.
Petloss,366yg1,hendrixchild419,2,Sun May 17 05:50:02 2015 UTC,"No I feel ya. I had a lab that I grew up with, was the greatest dog in the world and when I moved out he came with. He ended up getting diabetes and the care for him was difficult at younger age and eventually had to be put to rest. I still think about the times he wasn't feeling well and I allowed him to not feel well by not giving him the proper care. Even though that dog and I had the greatest times in the world, I am still haunted by not being the best of owner at times."
Petloss,366yg1,doppelganger_eidolon,1 point,Sun May 17 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to read this. Poor baby, I totally feel your agony. I live in the south now, and I have Shepherds, but when I found a coyote in my back yard at 5 am not too long ago, the size of my dogs didn't bring me any measure of comfort.  The coyotes are smaller here than in San Diego, where I grew up.   Still, I stalk my yard in the mornings now, armed with a .40 H&K and a machete. I will not hesitate to protect my dogs, the neighborhood cats that don't even belong to me, and any other animal that is being stalked by this scourge of civilization."
Petloss,366yg1,doppelganger_eidolon,2,Sun May 17 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks... and wow, you're really going all out to get that guy, huh? lol. I was actually thinking about picking up an airsoft gun and giving it what for if it ever dared come back for more. Though I'm not familiar with firearms at all.  I admire you're so earnestly protecting the neighborhood's domesticated animals. Are there laws governing that kind of thing?"
Petloss,366yg1,doppelganger_eidolon,1 point,Sun May 17 05:47:54 2015 UTC,"There are laws. I live in an historical neighborhood in Memphis, TN. Unfortunately, there is gunfire from time to time, because most historical neighborhoods back up to areas that are, for lack of a better description, ""crack alleys.""  Whether the laws are upheld or not depends on whether someone reports it, and I honestly don't expect anyone to report it. My back yard backs up to a crematorium belonging to the funeral home on the corner of a main road - everything behind me is the back of a business facing a main thoroughfare.   My next door neighbor is a blind ninety-something, and I've done enough favors for him that he'd just come over to ask about it if he heard something.   My other next door neighbor is the neighborhood cat lady, and I've had to race out of my house before with a machete to protect her feline friends from certain roving packs of dogs we have, unfortunately, been beset upon by from time to time.  And if none of the above factors in, I work in law - although not law enforcement - and I know the local police very well.  I'd rather ask for forgiveness than permission...although an airsoft would probably work - that, or a pump action bb rifle.  Depends on how close you can get."

As much as I hate to consider the stupidity of the legalities I'd have to maneuver through, Tennessee only recently extended its ""castle doctrine"" law to vehicles.

Petloss,362tef,LordCharco_iii,2,Sat May 16 01:50:58 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's something, unfortunately, as pet parents, we will all deal with at some point or another. In my case, in a family of animal lovers, I too often have to say goodbye to my furry friends, even my family's pets. I know it must be especially difficult with it being so sudden and unexpected. I try to remind myself every day with my dog to tell him I love him and treat him because you can't predict the way the world works sometimes. I would offer you some comfort in saying that instead of thinking about the loss constantly, as impossible as it may seem, and think of all the ways you made her life better. Think of where she might have ended up if not with you as a loving owner. I've always taken comfort in the fact that any rescue animal I've lost lived a lot better, spoiled, and most likely longer, life than if I hadn't been there. I'm sure you were that lifesaver for her. It's clear how much she meant to you, and dogs have an innate sense of understanding human emotions, without you even saying a word. She wouldn't want you to mourn her too much. She'd want you to remember all the good times you had together, what a benefit and blessing she was on your life, and that for a lot of dogs 17 is a good, long life, despite how unfortunate it is that it was so sudden. I'm not a churchy person, and I don't ever try to tell anyone what to believe, but I do believe in a God and I do believe in heaven, and if heaven is the perfect paradise it supposedly is, it will have animals there. Your girl will be there. My lost furry friends will be waiting for me. And if they aren't, I'll tell God himself to send me to wherever good animals go when they pass away. Anyone who's ever truly loved an animal knows they have a soul and a personality each their own, and that if our spirits live on after death, surely theirs' must too. Again, I'm very saddened and sorry to hear about this and wanted to offer my deepest condolences. Went through a tough incident recently and the people here were an immense source of comfort and support, and I feel it's only right to pay it forward. If you ever need someone to talk to, like most subscribers of this sub, am more than happy to. I would also suggest this resource as I've used some of these numbers in the past and they've really helped me: http://rainbowsbridge.com/grief_support_center/pet_loss_resources/petloss_hot_lines.htm  http://vetmed.illinois.edu/CARE/  http://www.vet.cornell.edu/Org/PetLoss/Resources/  These folks are incredibly understanding and trained to help people cope with the loss of beloved pets. Most are veterinary students, or vets themselves, and have seen it all firsthand and understand personally the love for animals. They chose an incredibly difficult and sometimes ungratifying job of being a veterinarian because of their genuine love for animals. Feel free to share these links as I think they're great for anyone going through something similar. Please accept my deepest condolences and if there's anything I can help you with, just let me know. We, as human beings, have to take care of each other. Peace and Love"

Petloss,35zd52,twisterkid34,4,Thu May 14 20:02:25 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry. Losing our little buddies hurts bad. I take some comfort in that I'll be seeing them again. I'm gonna run up to that damn rainbow bridge and hug all of my best friends! RIP for your bun and take care.

Petloss,35ykrf,AlwaysDisposable,4,Thu May 14 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"He probably is a little lonely and just misses his friend. Doggy day care sounds like a good idea.  Also, I do this thing with my dog sometimes where I spend a whole Saturday afternoon doing things he likes - just him and I - away from my husband and our other dog. We go to the park, take a walk together, go to Petco or Petsmart, and I'll even get him a special treat. He seems to really respond to this bonding time. Maybe something similar would help your dog?"
Petloss,35ykrf,acar87,1 point,Thu May 14 21:29:56 2015 UTC,"My dog does like the dog park and I don't take him nearly enough because it's so far away. Maybe I'll try doing that more often, or at least taking him to play with my mom's dogs more since I go over there every week.  I discussed things with my roommates and they are going to try letting their big dog stay in the living room with my dog while they sleep in late (they let her out around 7am to potty then normally they go back to sleep til noon). They said it works fine for them because the dog often interrupts their sleep in the mornings anyways.   Thanks."
Petloss,35xfz1,krystyne11,2,Thu May 14 09:23:15 2015 UTC,"My dog Max was put down August 11th 2014, same day Robin Williams died. He was almost 17 and had a bad heart, My Mother Held him while my dad and I huddled around, he was gone very quick and I know he's waiting at the Rainbow bridge for me. Please don't blame yourself, things happen that are out of our control like cancer. Izzy made it to the Rainbow Bridge 8 days after Max, they're playing together and waiting for us! :) Message me if you ever want to talk."
Petloss,35xfz1,-BLAM,2,Thu May 14 13:21:48 2015 UTC,"I had to put my 15 year old dog, Shadow, down August 14th last year. I have had him since I was 7. The last year and a half was the worst. I wanted him around as long as I could but seeing him deteriorate really messed with me. He started losing his balance, eyesight, hearing, bladder and bowel control. It was not fun taking care of him but I couldn't give up on him when he was still so happy to see me every day. It's really hard coming home to silence now.  His last day felt so rushed it was uncomfortable. We had to find a mobile vet as he couldn't be taken anywhere and it made it so easier on us. Seeing him smile so big the last hour is the only thing keeping me positive. It's like he knew what was happening and was happy that he was going to be at peace soon. I'm glad he went peacefully as I always dreaded having to put him down in pain because he could of easily broken a bone or had a tumor pop.  As a guy that never cries, crying everyday is really eating away at me. I hope I get out of this funk soon. I want to be happy just like my dog would want me to be and just like I wanted him to be."
Petloss,35xfz1,xrCore,1 point,Fri May 15 05:47:40 2015 UTC,"My dog dies 2 days ago shortly after surgery. I know the vet bill will be enormous but she was worth every cent and more. I too can't afford this but will pay it off gradually. That being said, you can't blame yourself for being unable to take Izzy to the vet (being cancer it might not have made much difference). The only way I have found to help the grief is to get another pet. You won't be replacing your deceased dog but honoring him."
Petloss,35wsdm,Gfofgamer,3,Thu May 14 03:59:35 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel, my dog that past last year in September was roughly 16 possibly 17, we never knew his exact age. But him and I grew up together, and that loss is hard to get through, if you have a SO, they can usually help a lot. My girlfriend is mostly what helped me keep going because she had gone through it as well. All I can really say is it takes time, I don't think I'll ever get over my fuzzy buddy being gone, but I will always be happy he was here when he was.  I haven't gotten a new pup, but my girlfriend and I plan on getting one soon(ish) when we move in together.  I wish you the best of luck and I'm deeply sorry for your loss, whatever you do, don't get a new one right away. When I thought about doing that it made me think I was trying to replace him and didn't feel right at all."
Petloss,35wsdm,PinkPartyPony,1 point,Thu May 14 05:21:20 2015 UTC,My SO was at the vet with me when it happened. It was so helpful to have him there. He hasn't gone through it but he grew fond of my dog in the 5 years we've been together. He's been very supportive of me and my on again off again sadness.
Petloss,35sjx9,DoctorPoo25,3,Wed May 13 03:42:29 2015 UTC,Everyone grieves in their own way. That being said from the sound of it your bond with them wasn't that strong and that's OK. I had a ferret once who I didn't connect with and when he passed on I didn't feel a ton of grief. I wish i'd treated him better (though we treated him well enough) but he just wasn't a very friendly critter. I think the best thing you can do is be kind to yourself and not kick yourself for not feeling as upset as you think you should. You're not a bad person.
Petloss,35sjx9,ziddersroofurry,0,Wed May 13 10:18:59 2015 UTC,"that's ok don't feel bad about it, a bird is sometimes just a bird"

I have hit things on the road and been sad about it, but you must understand that you gotta protect you no matter what. You'll be alright. It happens to the best of us and know that you couldn't have known."

I would have literally rolled the vehicle to save this guy if I could have. If it were up to me I'd be in the hospital and this poor guy would be headed home to his family. The world can be such an unfair bitch sometimes"
Petloss,35ojkr,lacks_imagination,3,Tue May 12 06:08:51 2015 UTC,"It seems to me it was an honest accident, so I don't think you should punish yourself.  I believe your empathy for the cat is traveling to him, wherever he is, and I think that comforts him.  Hang in there."
Petloss,35ojkr,lucuma21,4,Tue May 12 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your response. I know it didn't mean much, but even when I knew he was gone I sat there for a while and petted him and closed his eyes to make him as peaceful as possible. Hopefully he forgives me"
Petloss,35ojkr,ziddersroofurry,3,Tue May 12 17:39:33 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry for what happened. You are going above and beyond what most others would do faced with the same situation. I think that when there are times we cannot change what has occurred, we can at least take the next steps to give it a proper and rightful ending. You are doing that. Of course this isn't something you imagined would happen, but I admire you for your courage to follow through with this. I think you can take comfort in knowing that you are doing the right thing. Hang in there. And thank you for sharing your thoughts during this difficult time."
Petloss,35ojkr,Downtown_Joe,3,Tue May 12 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your words of comfort. It means a lot. I understand there are things out of our control, but you still have those thoughts of ""what if I'd just been in the other lane?"" and all. I do take comfort in doing everything I can to find the owner and if I can't I will give this creature the respectful and proper burial it deserves. I would literally rather have any boxer or UFC fighter alive punch me square in the face than deal with this. I intend to give this animal the same love and respect I would give any of my own furry family members in the same situation. Again, thanks so much for taking the time to console me. I come off as a tough guy, but I'm really just a big teddy bear. A perfect opportunity to beg and plead for people to at least tag their pets if they intend to let them roam free"
Petloss,35ojkr,littlewolfen,3,Tue May 12 17:33:00 2015 UTC,There was nothing you could do. The odds are good that by taking the action you did you avoided causing a much bigger accident that may have involved a lot more loss of life. You don't deserve to beat up on yourself the way you are doing. The best thing you can do is do what you can to let a vet in the area know about it in case the owner calls looking for them and do what you can to encourage people to keep their cats on leashes or indoors. This is a huge reason why cat owners need to keep their cats inside.
Petloss,35ojkr,Dolphin_Titties,3,Wed May 13 10:23:54 2015 UTC,"I know that it sucks that sometimes shit happens, things that you just can't control. However doing the right thing - spending a few moments with the poor guy and then trying to find the owner to let them know what happened - is HUGE.  I've had pets just up and vanish on me, and someone taking the time to track me down and give some closure would have meant so much to me."
Petloss,35ol3u,HiBills,2,Tue May 12 06:08:54 2015 UTC,"I have lost four pets over the course of my lifetime, and I know the grief is real and sharp.  But it also fades.  I think we grieve so sharply for our pets because our relationships with them are so pure and direct.  Our relationships with pets are not complex, multilayered with disappointment and stress like human friendships, so when we have to say goodbye we are sad but not also frustrated or resentful at promises unkept or needs unmet. Try to remember that cats have no unfinished business.  They live utterly in the moment, and if they are loved they know it right up until the last moment.   Soon, you will remember your cat with smiles and warmth, not pain. I promise."
Petloss,35ol3u,Pearl2,1 point,Tue May 12 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to both of you for your loss. Wicca sounds like a wonderful little kitty and all three of you were so blessed to have had the chance to share such a deep bond, full of love and joy. I lost my kitty of 14.5 years a week ago, and I'm too familiar right now with that feeling of loss and deep sadness. But past all of those feelings, I know how incredibly blessed I was for having him in my life. Know that you two are also blessed for little Wicca (love her name btw).  I wrote a piece on love and loss here in this subreddit last week. http://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/34y9rf/a_love_so_boundless_and_eternal/ I read it every morning to remind me of how lucky I was.

Petloss,35bhg5,ziddersroofurry,3,Mon May 11 01:25:48 2015 UTC,It's OK. You gave them so much love. I know it feels horribly unfair and that nothing anyone can say can really help right now but please...don't be angry at you. If you need to go somewhere private and scream and cry and take your rage out on a pillow do that but whatever you do be careful.   Be kind to yourself. The best thing you can do to cherish their memory is by cherishing the person who made them so happy. You did that. Not everyone or everything in this world gets to have that kind of love in their life.   You did good. Be kind to you and know you're not alone.
Petloss,35bhg5,ProbablyNotADuck,3,Fri May 8 20:01:00 2015 UTC,"This is a great answer. If you need to punch something, punch something. I would recommend against a wall for several reasons, but a pillow... a punching bag... something that won't hurt you and won't cost money to repair is ideal. The thing about grief is the more you try to hold it in, the worse it gets. Crying, screaming, yelling are cathartic and good for you, as long as they are not directed at another human or living thing.   Dogs live in the moment. They are role models for how we should all live our lives. I am sure your dog missed you. I am sure she would have been thrilled for your return, but I am also willing to bet that she did not think you abandoned her. In her mind, you simply went somewhere else while she stayed behind with someone else she trusted.  But even when we logically know we shouldn't feel guilt, that doesn't mean we won't feel it.   I am so sorry for your loss. I hope you find what you need to in order to grieve the way you need."

Petloss,3597nf,peanutbutter14,6,Fri May 8 03:57:59 2015 UTC,"My heart goes out to your loss. You said it best... ""nothing could ever fully prepare me"". Elly sounds like a warrior and a true friend. There's only one reason why Elly would battle so hard and fight through so much to stick around... that's because of the love that was shared between you and her. Obviously her last few months of her life were unpleasant (especially for her) but the cause of that is not Elly's character or a lack of love on your part... the root is purely her arthritic condition... and something more deeper.... That in this world, living things don't live forever. That is both terrifyingly sad and beautiful because we get to look at Elly's life as a whole, as an entirety, and find so much joy in the totality of the ten years rather than focus on the last few months. I wish you all the love and warmth in this healing process.  Here's to Elly, Hani (my dog who passed 2 years ago via injection because of a worsening condition), and...  Tobi (my best friend of the past 14 years who passed away last week). I wasn't around to be there for Tobi during his last years of his life because I moved to New York for graduate school. So I am definitely experiencing some similar feelings of guilt over not being there for my truest and most loyalest friend."

Petloss,3597nf,rogueXleader,2,Fri May 8 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"I am incredibly sorry for your loss and can't begin to contemplate dealing with a similar situation. I believe all dogs go to heaven, because what would paradise be without man's best friend. If there aren't dogs in heaven I'm not going. Sending my love and support. I'm here for anyone who needs someone to talk to about their loss, as I've had several myself. I'm so very sorry things went less peacefully than they could have, but trust I can tell that in your heart you were doing the right thing for a pet you loved. Hugs and prayers"

Petloss,356qhi,krissee,6,Thu May 7 15:52:02 2015 UTC,That is horrible. I am so sorry you have to deal with this. Do any of your neighbors have any outdoor cameras? I would also see if there are any cameras in your neighborhood. There's got to be a way to track down this person who felt the need to steal your dog. I wish you the best of luck.
Petloss,356qhi,fly_eagles_fly,3,Thu May 7 18:49:38 2015 UTC,"There are no cameras. I live in the country unfortunately people out here feel safe enough to not need cameras. It IS possible the original owners came and took her, I did talk to them (one of my neighbors recognized the pup and said she belonged to his brother but his brother said we could keep her because he had no time for her) and as much as I don't want to give up hope considering there are at least 3 known dog fighting rings around here its kind of hard to keep hope alive. All I Can hope forbis that where ever she is she is happy and safe and loved."
Petloss,356qhi,eureka_exclamation,4,Fri May 8 01:10:59 2015 UTC,"You don't have to give up hope. There's always hope pup will find its way back to you. Keep knocking on doors, let your neighbours know,  and post any pictures- online or around your place, - Facebook, twitter, here in your local subreddit. Craigslist, too. Don't give up hope."
Petloss,356qhi,lacks_imagination,3,Thu May 7 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"Isn't it possible that the original owners saw her and picked her up?  Even so, they should have told you and not sneaked off with her."
Petloss,3557jg,krissee,2,Thu May 7 05:12:34 2015 UTC,This helped me when I had to say goodbye to my beloved dog. http://ahimsadogtraining.com/blog/2011/08/28/you%E2%80%99re-not-crazy-you%E2%80%99re-mourning-grief-from-the-loss-of-your-dog/
Petloss,3555x8,belovedlittledoll,5,Thu May 7 04:52:05 2015 UTC,"I assure, you... you did not fail. The complete opposite is true - you are the best pet parent in the world for your sacrifice. A loss is a loss, and grieving is completely appropriate. But guilt has no place in your situation. You do not need to justify your action to providing them a good home. Part of being a good parent is making tough choices and heartbreaking sacrifices for the good of your loving babies. It wasn't supposed to be easy, or make you happy... it was simply the right thing to do, and you should be SO proud of yourself for being strong enough to make the right choice.  So, give yourself a big break and know that it's ok to be sad. But know your love extended so deeply, that you did the most heartbreaking sacrifice for the good of your pets. I will keep you in my thoughts and wish you the very best."
Petloss,3555x8,lucuma21,4,Thu May 7 16:13:01 2015 UTC,I know how that feels. I am so sorry you are going through this but please don't feel guilty about it know that you are doing the best thing you can for them and that's giving them to a loving home who can care for them while you care for yourself. Much love.
Petloss,3534u0,ileikboopy,3,Wed May 6 18:33:25 2015 UTC,I am so sorry. I know there's not much I can say that will help. Please accept my condolences :/ -offers a hug-
Petloss,3534u0,ziddersroofurry,2,Wed May 6 19:51:01 2015 UTC,Thank you <3
Petloss,3534u0,lacks_imagination,6,Wed May 6 19:52:09 2015 UTC,I'm a philosopher prof. and I don't think there is a satisfactory answer to your question.  I'll only guess that maybe this happened because God/Universe wanted both of them to be in Dog Paradise together so that neither would be lonely.  Sorry for your double loss.
Petloss,3534u0,Spiralyst,8,Wed May 6 21:28:25 2015 UTC,The fact that they don't have to grieve and miss each other is the only thing that I can find comfort in right now.
Petloss,3534u0,kilamumster,4,Wed May 6 21:53:35 2015 UTC,"It's actually a huge silver lining. If these dogs grew up together, the loss of one will change the other. And the grief you're experiencing is coming all at once, instead of being spread out over two distinct events. Since both your dogs were senior in age, you'd probably be endless fretting over the health of the remaining dog and having experienced that, wouldn't want anyone to have to go through it.   I'm very sorry for your loss. Time heals everything."
Petloss,3534u0,kilamumster,2,Thu May 7 04:39:46 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss, OP. That's so sad. Do you mind sharing what happened?"
Petloss,3534u0,rapmachinenodiggidy,6,Wed May 6 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"Spooky was my little poodle.  He was 14, totally deaf and nearly 100% bald - a strange look for a poodle, to be sure, but I maintain that it was endearing.  He was every bit a crotchety old man, complete with grizzled gray beard - one of his only remaining patches of hair.  We think he had a stroke a few days ago because he was having trouble moving his right leg, but then he was fine.  He died in his sleep and my mom found him when she went down to feed them breakfast at 6am this morning.  Our golden Molson was on the younger side, only 10.  Definitely slowing down, but he still went on 1-2 mile runs with me and loved to frolic at the local dog park.  He'd been acting odd (lethargic and not eating - and he loooooved food) so my mom took him to the vet at 9am - she'd made the appointment a day or two before.  They did xrays and found a mass on his spleen that was so large it hard ruptured the spleen.  He had a particular type of cancer that happens in larger dogs that has no symptoms until the spleen ruptures, and once that happens, the cancer is in late enough stages that removing the spleen would only result in a lot of pain for only a month or two of life.  She decided it was kindest to let him go join Spooky in Rainbow Bridge."
Petloss,3534u0,rapmachinenodiggidy,3,Wed May 6 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"That's so sad, but so loving of you and your mom to save Molson from a world of pain.   When our GSD was getting on, we knew it was time and planned to take her to the vet in the morning. All the cats came and spent time sleeping next to her and licking her face now and then. I was with her at the vets, and she went peacefully. Still the best dog I ever had."
Petloss,3534u0,rapmachinenodiggidy,2,Wed May 6 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"Wow op, what a horrific kick in the stones. Truely tragic, I'm sorry. Know that they had long and it sounds like awesome lives and this is the way of things, once past 9 I think all time is bonus with a big dog. This sounds cold but start looking for new pooches, yours is a dog home and no dog home should be without dogs for long. Good luck."

Petloss,34z692,josh6499,6,Tue May 5 21:17:52 2015 UTC,"She's home!!!! She just came home!! Thank you so much for your kind words, they really meant a lot to me. I feel as though your prayer helped. She was extremely dirty and threw up some grass so it's clear to me she's been through quite an adventure. I am so happy she is with me now. She's grounded for a few days though, kitty can't make mama that worried and go outside again for awhile."
Petloss,34z692,josh6499,2,Tue May 5 21:54:04 2015 UTC,"Hooray!   I feel as though your prayer helped.   It's no coincidence, YHWH is looking out for you and your kitty! Keep a close eye on her from now on. :D"

Petloss,34yxkr,lacks_imagination,2,Wed May 6 18:31:57 2015 UTC,Thats very sad. She must have been very attached to you since she was so shy.

Petloss,34tn6w,NixFinn,2,Mon May 4 13:45:51 2015 UTC,"As someone who has been struggling with the ""I should have..."" mindset for he last few months, my advice is to remember that you're just a human being. You know that, and I'm sure Mörri knows that. You've taken care of him as best you could, and have given him an amazing life. The simple truth is, nobody knows what the future holds, and you letting him go out on his own was you letting him be himself, he lived the way he wanted, even to this day. I doubt he regrets anything you did, and he's probably grateful for having a great owner.  Besides, hindsight is Always 20/20. Getting caught up on what ""could be"" isn't what you should do. What has passed is irrelevant; be a great friend to him now and show him you'll be by his side. Believe me when I say that he's fighting the best he can to stay with you, by your side, and you should promise him you'll stay beside him.  And, though you shouldn't think about this too much, if things are as bad as you fear and it's his time to go, stay with him till the end. It'll hurt, but it hurts more knowing you weren't there. Like I said, be by his side, and trust he's fighting to stay there by yours."

But if you could find it within your sweet and loving self to rescue someone who desperately needs you and your beautiful heart it might just make all the difference.  Best wishes!

Petloss,34mw84,jaistuart,2,Sat May 2 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"I lost my dog of 15 years yesterday man. The last time I saw him, he looked so sad. He had had a tumor burst in his stomach yesterday and was bloated bad, we didn't realise exactly what had happened until we took him to the vet.  I wasn't there when they put him down. I don't think I can forgive myself for this (parents took him at 1am while I was asleep). So the last time I saw him, when he was bloated, he was drinking his water, but he looked so sad, I've never seen that look on his face before in 15 years.   Last night I dreamed he was alive and had made it out okay. There will probably be more rough nights ahead for both of us and I don't think there is much we can do except let time blunt the hurt. At least now our dogs aren't in pain any more, which we should be grateful for.   Take care bro."

Petloss,34hnmc,ProbablyNotADuck,3,Fri May 1 23:49:37 2015 UTC,"The thing about dogs is that they live in the moment. They don't care about the walks you never took them on. They care that you are with them right now. Whether you've been gone 5 minutes, 5 hours or 5 months, they are thrilled each and every time you walk through the door.   Maybe, looking back on things, there are things you wished you'd done a little differently, but I bet your dog thinks you've done just fine. And being with him on Saturday will show him just how much you care.   I am not going to lie: it blows hard. I had to put my dog to sleep a month ago, and I feel like I am missing a limb. He's just supposed to be here, but he's not. But I know that putting him to sleep was in his best interest. He was sick. I couldn't fix him, but I could make sure he didn't suffer, and I could stay right by his side until he was gone. It's heart breaking, but it's the price we pay to be able to experience such incredible love from them."

We fed /r/rawpetfood and did not use any spot on drops, like Frontline, or Roundup in the yard, but still, all it takes is one oversight of chemical use.  Spend as much time and love as you can now. Take a lot of photos and videos, if you haven't already.  Peace."

She was old though, 11 years, and she had a pretty cool life roaming around the forest and scaring the horses and attacking the hoover and stuff, she was a pretty happy dog who was convinced she was a puppy lap dog until the end. I definitely thing timing it to have as small an amount of time without a dog in the house. Having Luna move in only a few hours after the vet left has definitely meant there is less an air of sorrow and a little bundle of joy bouncing about making us smile in stead!"

Petloss,33ng1i,briantology,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. Reading this brought me to tears. I think Tamtu had a good chance so don't second guess yourself on medicating him.   When the time comes, he will let you know. It will be an understanding between the two of you. Yes it hurts, and I don't think the hurt will ever go away but in the end we have to do what is right by our beloved pets and be grateful for the time that we have shared with them. Hang in there, so will I."
Petloss,33kmec,Hildaelisa,3,Thu Apr 23 07:46:17 2015 UTC,"Don't be scared to be with him when it is time to say goodbye. You can do it. In time, it will prove golden, for you were with each other, up until the end. Grief is absolute proof that you can love and are a caring person. You are not alone. And he looks so cool, you should feel grateful he was part of your life. Allow the grief to run its course, and one day, you will know it is that day, and grief will let loose of its grip on the love, to let it blossom stronger and even more loving. Hang in there, for in doing so, I have to hang in there too."
Petloss,33kmec,TyrellCadabra,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:46:22 2015 UTC,"Cabezón is such a handsome cat! It seems like he lived a life full of love.  Saying goodbye to our beloved pets does hurt. We said goodbye to one of our baby boys yesterday and I still cannot get over the fact that he is gone. I still looked for him early this morning when I woke up, only to find his favorite spot beside my bed empty. I don't think the pain will ever go away. I take solace in the fact that he is in a better place free of hurt. When the time comes that you have to let Cabezón go, he will let you know. It seems like he had a good life with you, and because of him, other cats got cared for too."
Petloss,33kmec,TheYoungWolfKing,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:12:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words. I try to take solace in knowing that he's the reason many cats are being cared for. It just seems like the time is coming so soon, especially since he's only been with us less than 4 years.   I'm so sorry for your loss."
Petloss,33kmec,TheYoungWolfKing,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:20:38 2015 UTC,Thank you.. The time we soend with them seems so short but in the end what matters is what we've done and the loved we shared while they were still with us. You guys have been through a lot and I'm sure that he is grateful that you took her and other cats in.
Petloss,33kmec,ProbablyNotADuck,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:26:01 2015 UTC,"It seems like an impossible thing to do, but (if it needs to be done) you will find the strength to do it. I couldn't imagine how I would be able to stay in the room with my dog when it was time, but I knew that I had to be because he deserved at least that much from me.   It seems impossible, but (if it needs to be done) you will find the strength to do it. And, yes, your heart will probably hurt... But, for me at least, it is also a very healing experience, and entirely worth all the discomfort and pain to be able to provide all that love and warmth right to their very last breath.   Saying goodbye to a pet blows hard. You don't grieve any less just because you know it was time or that they lived a good life. I don't think you ever really come to miss your pet any less as time passes, but, as others have mentioned, the grief loosens its hold on you, and you find yourself focusing on all the wonderful times you've had together rather than the pain you felt when it is all over. And that is why people continue to get pets, even after having suffered a loss... because it is a heartbreak that is entirely worth it."
Petloss,33k8ex,porridge8712,2,Thu Apr 23 04:43:47 2015 UTC,"This brought me to tears. Having just lost a beloved pet recently, I can understand what you're going through. My baby boy was 5 years old, it was totally unexpected. One day he was beside me in bed and the next he stopped eating and would only drink water. His life was too short, amd it hurts to have lost him so soon. His kidneys stopped working properly and he also had bacterial pneumonia. We did our best to save him, medical expenses be damned. But I guess it was really his time to go. He needed to be free of the pain that he was feeling.  I trust you will do the right thing by Jasper when the time comes. In the end, it matters not how much time we have spent with our furry babies but instead the love we shared with them while they were with us. The pain may be unbearable for now but that is nothing compared to the love they have given us their whole lives."
Petloss,33k8ex,TheYoungWolfKing,2,Thu Apr 23 06:35:52 2015 UTC,"Hang in there, it's hard, I know. I just lost my good friend yesterday, a great cat who'd been around through a lot. I'm so sorry you have to go through it, it's so sad when we lose our lovable furballs. Always a place in our hearts for them. Take care"

Petloss,33glci,TyrellCadabra,2,Wed Apr 22 11:56:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you for your words.. Yes, we did love him very much.. I just feel so guilty because maybe if we had taken him to the vet sooner he'd still be here. He stopped eating a week ago but kept on drinking water, I thought he would make it but when we took him to the vet yesterday we were told that his kidneys had stopped working properly and in addition to that, he also had bacterial pneumonia. We stayed with him through the night, gave him medicine and made sure that he did not feel alone. He was in so much pain and yet he never cried. He was such a trooper.   The mornings are the hardest, when he is not there to greet me and follow me around anymore."
Petloss,33glci,TyrellCadabra,2,Wed Apr 22 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"My first cat died of kidney failure, I know what that is like. I stayed with him his entire last weekend, even gave injections, some of which for the pain. I felt so guilty for making that his last days, but he had a good chance, and I would do it again. Sounds like you also did everything you possibly could, and on top of that, surrounded him with care, and the people he loved. Don't give guilt too much credit, what you wrote is love, up until the very end. That takes love and above all courage, guilt doesn't even get invited. Hang in there, for then, so will I."
Petloss,33glci,TyrellCadabra,2,Wed Apr 22 18:07:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I really appreciate your wisdom during this tough time in my life. We both tried to save our babies but it was their time to go, I guess. It's hard loving pets because we know we will outlive them but nothing compares to the love that they give us during our time together."
Petloss,33glci,TyrellCadabra,2,Thu Apr 23 02:58:11 2015 UTC,"You are more than welcome, it can be hellish, but remember... the grief is proof that you are able to love, and have loved. My cat that went over the bridge on Tuesday night was very young and only with me for a year, and yet, their impact can be a big as my one before that, who was with me for over almost eight years.   Both came from the pound, and despite my shock in the first 24 hours, there will be a new adoptee, my 4th to be. I just have to build the courage to surrender to my grief first now. No rush, no resistance, let it come, so grief can one day turn its face again, for that is love. We long for that day, but we can't plan it. However, when it arrives, you will know. On my current journey, I found the work of mr. James E. Miller and his 'An Affirmation of those who Have Lost' poem quite comforting and very helpful. He has quite a few free mini-video's that teach you a lot, especially little signs of love and hope despite the shroud that tries to obscure them at the moment. His poem is over at Rainbowbridge.com, at the bottom of the FAQ. His free mini-video's are at his page at http://www.willowgreen.com/  Take note of his Gifts video. Even when I brought my love away, there was a very peculiar cat there that knew what was going on and comforted me. He even stopped by my love's soulless body on the table. When I got home and the neighbor stopped by to see how I was doing, there was another neighbourhood cat I know well. It never came in this last year because of my cat. Yesterday, it didn't even check to see if it was there, he walked in, checked the house, and comforted me. He would never simply do that if he didn't know the coast was clear.   These are small gifts, it could simply be a sunbeam on a wet leaf, but keep an eye out for them. Those will likely make you cry and smile at the same time, but in this state, we can notice them quicker. We survived another day and night, and so we shall continue, building and healing ourselves. This is very good for me too, writing helps a lot, so thank you as well for writing back, and listening."
Petloss,33glci,TyrellCadabra,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:31:08 2015 UTC,"Even if we have only been with them for a short period of time, the hurt can be as great as if they've been with us for far much longer than that. I also had a puppy who was only with me for four days but that doesn't lessen the love that we have for them and the pain that comes along with it when the end comes. Thank you for the link. It encourages me to find inspiration during this dark time. I also found that reading the ""Losing a Best Friend"" compilation by the SFSPCA helps too. It can be found here: https://spcasc.org/programs-resources/pet-loss-support/  When I woke up this morning I felt a bit lost and couldn't help but cry but being able to talk about my loss on here with someone who understands somewhat keeps me sane. I really appreciate this. Thank you."
Petloss,33glci,sudo-intellectual,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:28:51 2015 UTC,"I just did the same, I felt a bit lost as well, and there was your message. Thanks a lot for that, and the link! I'll let you know what I think. Dr. Miller's small video's are actually at http://griefhelps.com btw. Yesterday I was able to work a bit as well, so that was good. Pat yourself on the back for every little thing. Be a pall to yourself and feel proud of being able to stick with our loved ones, especially when life's wind picks up.   Don't feel bad for yourself if you have a couple of good hours, or days. How is it possible to feel a bit good right now?! It's all perfectly normal. Rainy day? I enjoy the rain on my face.   You should do something nice with that picture, or another. A friend of mine wanted to when his Labrador passed, but the picture he loved most, he also couldn't look at without breaking down. I proposed to make it into a painting. That now graces his living room, as does another Labrador dashing around.   I also found this. I fall for the Sidekick, Personal Assistant, my last two cats were that. But I like a dash of Secret Admirer, I know cats well and enjoy giving them time to adjust to me and their new home.   The test also showed Orange, which is nice to know and to get confirmed. I also took the Dog one, and that took me to Orange as well, however, description like I liked the Goofball and Free spirit best. Every pet makes us a better human and guardian, and that is but a small piece of the total impact they have on our lives.   Take care of yourself and Timothy's brother, he needs you too now. Grief can be a rollercoaster, but you are not alone. And the fact that you can write about it, is very healthy as well. Thanks for keeping my spirits up too, feel free to message anything back, or tell me how it is going."
Petloss,33glci,briantology,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the links and for writing back. I've yet to watch the videos amd I'm feeling a bit better now, of course there are the little triggers, like his collar, his favorite squeaky toy but I manage to smile at the memories of my baby boy. He was so loved, and he loved us back a thousandfold!   I also have a cat, and he is an Orange too. A personal assistant, my kitty. For the doggies, Timmy is my Wallflower and his twin is the Goofball. Kind of opposites but they complement each other in a way, like Yin Yang. And a senior puppy as well, she is our Free Spirit. Very much independent which makes me miss my boy because he was the one who is always curled up next to me.  Like you, during the initial shock, I considered not getting another dog anymore but I really cannot imagine a life without a furry friend, a constant companion. Maybe when the time is right, I know Timmy will let me know when it is okay. Without our pets life would be so empty.  I think my cat feels that I'm grieving right now because he would just curl up to me and not bite my hand (which he always always does after positioning himself beside me).  One of these days when I'm able to look at his photos without crying, I'll look through my photo album to find the best picture of my little angel and I'll have it printed and framed.  This, and you, have really helped me a lot through the grieving process. Take good care of yourself too. Time will come and we will be able to open up our hearts to a new furry friend. You should always feel free to message me anything too. Thank you for sharing your story with me, and for being a comfort to me."

I could see that you were crying you found it hard to sleep.  I spoke to you softly as you brushed away a tear,  ""It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here.""  I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea,  You were thinking of the many times, your hands reached down to me.  I was with you at the shops today; your arms were getting sore.  I longed to take your parcels, I wish I could do more.  I was with you at my grave today; you tend it with such care.  I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.  I walked with you towards the house, as you fumbled for your key.  I gently put my paw on you; I smiled and said, ""it's me.""  You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair.  I tried so hard to let you know, that I was standing there.  It's possible for me, to be so near you everyday.  To say to you with certainty, ""I never went away.""   You sat there very quietly, then smiled, I think you knew...  in the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.  The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning  and say ""good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning.""  And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,  I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.  I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.  Be patient, live your journey out...then come home to me.  -Author unknown"

Petloss,33c42u,tinyirishgirl,2,Tue Apr 21 16:46:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words, it truly does mean a lot to me.  I was lucky with her, not being able to physically handle a dog again with my heath, the walking, etc. I wanted a cat who would want to be around people and be social like most dogs are, and she totally was that. She thought anything you were doing was the most interesting thing in the world, washing dishes, putting a Blu-Ray into a player, paper shredders, she even knew how to play hide and seek. No problems litter box training, no accidents, trimming nails was easy. She would come running to the door when you came home chirping as she ran. We 100% fluked out with her. She sometimes could be a picky eater though, that was probably her greatest fault. Once you get her to actually try it, she would find out it's yummy, haha."

Petloss,33901q,susanshoos,3,Mon Apr 20 18:49:56 2015 UTC,"I had my cat pass away in a similar way last month. It's been the hardest thing I've ever gone through. Don't feel guilty, you aren't a vet trained to know all the symptoms and cats try hard to hide their illnesses. You can learn from this and be able to take care of your other cats better. I'm really sorry for your loss. RIP Wilson."
Petloss,33901q,josh6499,2,Tue Apr 21 01:27:03 2015 UTC,"With absolutely no disrespect to the other answerers - if you feel guilt, you need to let yourself feel it. Hindsight - second-guessing oneself - there is simply no way to make those feelings vanish. So you will feel the guilt, and you will second-guess yourself, and you have to reach the place where you can forgive yourself - whether or not the guilt was justified. You gave Wilson a home and a life and love. He had those things, which he otherwise may have never had - he could well have died years ago had you not gotten him veterinary care back then, and the warmth of a loving home.  I started to write the story of the weeks of unbearable grief and guilt I went through when my kitty Gracie passed in 2006 - from an otherwise preventable disease, but that would have meant lots of vet intervention - and she hated the vet with a blur of claws so serious they had to wear chainmail to deal with her. But that's my story, and it isn't really relevant to your story. Every day we have with our little friends (who in a lot of ways are better than people friends) is a gift.   Wilson had a good life. He made your life better for it. But more importantly, you made Wilson's life better. Forgive yourself. Death comes to us all, inevitably. Wilson's time came. Your love for him keeps his spirit alive."

Having lost my baby boy to a kidney infection as well, I blame myself for not taking him to the vet sooner. Feeling guilty is normal because we are responsible for them. It's hard because they cannot tell us what is bothering or hurting them. But as most of the commenters have pointed out, what matters is the love we shared with our pets."
Petloss,33901q,TheYoungWolfKing,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:56:32 2015 UTC,"Greg, listen to me.  Cats are really good at hiding their sickness.  You did not love your cat while at the same time expecting him to get sick.  It's okay brother.  Wilson had a good life because you were a part of it.  And there is no garauntee any amount of veterinary intervention would have saved him.  Wilson loves you, man.  He always will."

You can be certain in this case, that he lived the best, most comfortable life that he ever could because you provided it for him.

Petloss,33916o,RogueDM1214,3,Mon Apr 20 16:47:53 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm a vet student with a little training in this subject. For someone who made the right choice in euthanasia as in this case with a sick, old dog, I would be sure to tell them that their choice to put their animal to sleep was their final gift to them: they've provided, loved and cared deeply for their pet for all them pet's life. It is only fitting that they be the one to help stop their animal's pain and suffering in a humane, painless way that is really almost just like falling asleep. The animal died comfortable ( medicated, sedated), content and happy with her owner.   My condolences for her loss: I had my dog euthanized at 14 with congestive heart failure. It was hard but it was the right thing to do."
Petloss,33916o,FabulousFlavor,3,Mon Apr 20 17:21:49 2015 UTC,"We did the same this morning and this poem helped us: A poem to help  author unknown:  If it should be that I grow frail and weak, and pain should keep me from my sleep, then you must do what must be done – for this last battle can’t be won,  You will be sad I understand. Don't let your grief then stay your hand. For this day more that all the rest, your love and friendship stand the test. We’ve had so many happy years, what is to come can hold no fears. Would you want me to suffer so? When the time comes, let me go.  Take me where my needs they’ll tend. Only stay with me til the end. And hold me firm and speak to me, until my eyes no longer see.  I know in time that you will see it is a kindness that you do for me. Although my tail its last has waved, from pain and suffering I’ve been saved.  Do not grieve; it has to be you who must decide this thing to do. We’ve been so close, we two, these years. Don't let your heart hold any tears.  The rainbow bridge is about loss of a pet."

For me, part of living with a death is to remember and share good memories of the passed loved one. Part of this process is having gratitude for the time we were able to share with them. This also helps them live on in a way. Ask her to share some of the memories.  There is nothing you can do to minimize how much she misses the pet. That only gets easier to live with as time passes and we get used to them being gone. Otherwise, just love her and let her do her thing. If it gets to be too much for you, take a break and go for a walk, a drive, a nap, etc."

They were most likely looking for bank cards that have pay pass and anything light enough to get away with on foot.   We took him to the vet and they couldn't do anything more then make him comfortable, I am forever grateful to the staff for their love and concern.  Our other dog Molly has been given puppy Valium, she pokes her head up the hall way and looks but doesn't come close. We hope she will come good but that will take time, love and unfortunately distance. From Luck's personality he must have come up doing his horsy bark being all excited to see someone come home and scared the guy. Lucky used to jump up a bit (as much as he could - Jack Russel) so him jumping may have annoyed the guy :( Lucky was probably just happy to see someone.  We came home and must have spooked the guy more so he jumped the fence into the bushland behind our house."

No amount of apologizing can change it though, which hurts the most. Waking up in the morning to have the pit of your stomach drop when you remember they are gone. Get an album together about him and place it where you can see it so when you are ready, you can remember the good times and not be haunted by the bad.

I came to this page tonight because I really have been missing my dog super bad today and it's been almost 4 years now. He was my best friend ever I had been with him for 13 years though everything and I honestly believe you never really get over the loss of a pet as some outsiders have told me.  I must say you most likely will come across non pet lovers/owners who just don't understand your loss, you have us here though.  It won't get easier you will just get stronger ( I know it sounds like a hallmark card) but everyday I thought and still do, what if I would've taken him to the hospital sooner for a thorough checkup.  Sadly we can't change the past. We just. Need to remember our pets as The loving family members they are and we will see them again later."
Petloss,32yeel,Venomousx,4,Fri Apr 17 19:11:55 2015 UTC,"OP, I know exactly how you feel. I wish I had pics, but my family had a similar situation.  One day, our neighbors, who were living on our property (we were renting out a trailer on our land), came to us and gave us this kitten who barely had her eyes open. They said they found her in a pipe, abandoned.  We fed her what we found out later was expired dry milk, causing her to lose her hair, so we named her Fluffy as a joke. We gave her real milk from a bottle and her hair began to grow back. She didn't know how to drink and didn't know how to control her claws, so she would scratch herself and bite off the nozzle on the bottle all the time. She was so adorable.  Eventually, she grew into her name. Long, beautiful fur. Our entire family adored her. Sometimes she had a temper, but never with my mom. She was my mom's baby. She didn't mind being pet for awhile - typical cat. She'd scratch if she had enough. But never with my mom. They were best friends.  There came a day years down the road when she was having trouble breathing and just laying around. This was on a Saturday night and came suddenly without warning. We waited until the morning and took her to a vet that was open on Sundays - which is tough to find! They put her in an oxygen tank (where she became super bouncy and happy) and...my mom and I were too heartbroken to go in and see. Only my sister was brave enough. Eventually, we were faced with a problem - either pay a few hundred dollars to keep her in the oxygen tank until Monday, when we could get the vet to treat her, or put her to sleep.  At the time, we weren't well off. We didn't have a lot of money. After seeing us crying in the parking lot, a good samaritan offered to give us about $50, but we had to give him his money back because it wasn't enough. We decided that the best thing to do would be to put her to sleep. And so that's what we did. My mom vowed from then on she'd never get a cat again, and she's kept to that.  This happened over a decade ago. Rest in peace, my little fluffluff. We all still think of you. I hope you're chasing mice in heaven."

Petloss,32tqmj,tophrman,5,Thu Apr 16 17:18:00 2015 UTC,"The best thing you can do is be reassuring that you are making the right decision. Your dog should not suffer and be in pain. It's hard putting an animal down, but I'm assuming the dogs situation is not going to improve and neither of you want to watch it suffer.   Don't bring up the idea of getting another dog. It might seem comforting to say you can get another one, but it's like saying you can replace a child. Animals have unique personalities that you create strong bonds with. It's important to have a mourning period. People tend to have a lot of resentment if they get another pet to early, because they expect that pet to be the same as the other.  Give her time to be alone if she asks for it. There are no magic words that will make her feel better. Otherwise keeping her mind on other things can help too. In time maybe go for a walk and talk about good memories, and how your wife gave the dog the best life it could have asked for. As a way of closer."
Petloss,32tqmj,earworms,2,Thu Apr 16 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Be with her, at her side, Have plenty of tissues in your pocket, and be ready to make a food and supply donation to a local shelter or rescue in the Dogs honor and memory."
Petloss,32tqmj,MTBinAR,3,Thu Apr 16 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"Make sure you do not press her either. Like earworm said, be reassuring that she is doing the right thing, but avoid things that make it seem like it's your choice and not hers. Nothing will end a relationship faster than her resenting you for putting the dogs down. I went through a phase, and I may still be in it, where I felt like my mom put down my dog out of convenience. That carried over to when my wife recently put down our most recent dog and I feel like, although it was sad, she was just done taking care of him and wanted out. It's shitty to say, but I feel that way even now and it burns inside me. He was 16 and I know that even if we hadn't done it that day, we would be talking about it until the next time we attempted it, and in between that time we would be cleaning up dog crap on the floor, vomit, and whatever else. It was time and I know it, but honestly it still felt to me like my wife did it out of convenience and I hate that I feel like that cause it's hard. Make sure SHE is ready, that it is her choice cause you do not want to be on the end of a dog mom who thinks you pushed her to do it."
Petloss,32tqmj,GunBrothersGaming,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"One thing I did the last time I had to put down a pet, is I decided to be in the room with him as he went. If your wife doesn't want to be in the room, maybe you should offer to stay for her. My logic is that this animal was a part of my life, and I won't leave him to have his last sight be a room full of strangers."

Petloss,32st5u,mollination,3,Thu Apr 16 12:54:37 2015 UTC,"Vets do not always give a sedative first and, based on personal experience, a sedative is not necessarily needed in order to ensure your pet has a peaceful transition. It entirely depends on the animal. My dog had no sedative first (the vet never asked). He was relaxed the entire time and the whole process couldn't have been more peaceful.   If you have questions about having a sedative first, talk to your vet (if you can). If you are too upset to talk to your vet in person or over the phone, send them an email and explain that. They understand. They empathize with you."

Petloss,32st5u,Spiralyst,2,Tue Apr 28 07:23:42 2015 UTC,"One of the better vets I've ever patroned had a room made especially for the final moments. Where all the other rooms resembled hospital rooms, the room they performed the final procedure was plush and warm and soothing with lots of serene artwork and comfortable furniture and pillows strewn about everywhere.  I moved away from the location of that vet and did not have a chance to take my dog in when it was time. I was pretty disappointed with the place I was made to take him...not because of the staff. They were wonderful. But I put my dog down in a very sterile room on a table and I will always regret that. I did lay him on his favorite blanket, though, which helped some."
Petloss,32st5u,Spiralyst,2,Thu Apr 16 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"There has been research about the fact that animals often prolong their own life for the benefit of their human people because they don't want us to see them suffer.  When my dog was starting to show signs of being very ill (kidneys), I asked a close friend who had a lot of experience with animals how I was supposed to know when it was time to put him down. My friend responded, ""Animals will let you know.""   I didn't quite know what to make of that at first, but sure enough he was right. One night, after more than a week of my dog barely eating and having a difficult time doing anything active, I took him outside to do his business. After a fashion I tried to lead him back inside, but he remained firm and would not follow me back inside no matter what I tried to persuade him. He just looked at me, I'll never forget it, deeply...like in my soul...and told me it was time.   I thanked him for his admission. It was hard to mistake it for anything else. I carried him inside and took him in the following day. I know he was in a lot of pain and it was difficult...extremely difficult...to reflect on his situation and try to reason with how much suffering he went through on my account because I just couldn't come to terms with losing my best friend of 10 years."
Petloss,32st5u,ProbablyNotADuck,2,Thu Apr 16 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"I had pretty much this exact moment with my dog. We were in my kitchen and he just stared right into my eyes for several seconds. It felt like he was saying, ""I'm ready whenever you are.""   My mom had told me and my siblings years before that our family dog gave her a look and ""she knew."" We sort of scoffed at the idea at the time, but I recently went back to her and apologized.   As soon as my dog gave me that look, I knew."
Petloss,32st5u,Spiralyst,2,Fri Apr 17 06:18:31 2015 UTC,"As sad as it is, it's one of the reasons I find dogs so special. There's a connection there that can't be understood from the outside.   Perhaps our dogs are sniffing each others butts somewhere right now!"
Petloss,32st5u,cutep0ison,2,Fri Apr 17 06:37:15 2015 UTC,"Similar thing happened with my beloved budgie. She had become sick and unable to move her legs, a week after taking her to the vet and getting medicine she still wasn't doing better and was only getting worse. I looked at her one day, and I knew. It's like she gave me a signal that it's her time. No longer than 10 minutes later I scheduled an appointment to have her put down within the hour, and I felt good with my decision because I knew she was in pain. Right after I got off the phone, I picked her up to go and she had passed. It's a sign you get from your animals, and while it is extremely heartbreakingly sad, it's also beautiful in the sense that we can feel their emotions. RIP to my beautiful Kazooie."

Yes the price is slightly more but it is about the pets comfort at home instead high strung at a vets office. I wish I would've known with my first dog.   The only issue is that wherever you decide to do the procedure at home, I wasn't able to look at the spot for quite a few days I intentially blinded my view or walked the long way because I just knew."

Petloss,32st5u,Spiralyst,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:42:29 2015 UTC,That's so cute. I just had to put my 14 year old golden retriever down a couple hours ago and I wish I could've remembered to give him one last meal.

Petloss,32tk0g,twanky,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:19:53 2015 UTC,So sorry for your loss. It is wonderful that you were willing to adopt an old grey face. She will be waiting for you at the rainbow bridge to give you hugs and kisses.
Petloss,32tk0g,JazzayNic,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:43:09 2015 UTC,Aww! that video...I'm literally bawling my eyes out.   I'm so glad you adopted her an she learned what real love is like from you. Rest in peace.
Petloss,32rjg1,SinNominae,5,Thu Apr 16 03:19:49 2015 UTC,"It's been a month since my pet passed away and I still find myself grieving, even though time has somewhat dulled the sharpness of the pain. Try to focus on things that bring happier recollections of your pet to mind, and try not to brood or focus too much on the sadder things. At the very least, remember that your cat spent a long full life with you, and that the depths of your sadness reflect your love for her.    Even knowing that it's highly probable that I will outlive most of my pets, I wouldn't trade the pure, unconditional love I receive from them for anything in the world.    My condolences at the loss of your friend."
Petloss,32rjg1,53r4c,3,Thu Apr 16 06:01:06 2015 UTC,"This is the most sincere and meaningful thing that I think someone in your position can hear and know:  The pet you loved and lost was going to be on this planet for a certain number of years one way or another whether or not they were in your home or they ended up somewhere else. The one thing that wasn't guaranteed was what those years would be like. Take comfort and solace in knowing that you provided your cat with the best 17 years she could have ever had, that those years were safe and secure, full of love and happiness. You and your sweet cat are part of a fortunate group in that she lived a LONG life in addition to everything else just listed. She might have had 10 or 14 years in someone else's home, or she might have been a stray who scrounged for food and didn't get to live as long as she should have. But that's not what happened. She ended up with you, her soul mate, and lived a long, safe, stable life where she never had to worry or suffer or want for anything. I think forming a connection with a pet is one of the hardest things we do, because it comes with the price that we will likely outlive them and have to say goodbye. When you think about parents to biological children, that's not the natural order of things. They're not supposed to outlive their children. When you think about friendships, you never know. Will you outlive them? Will you still be friends when one of you or both of you passes away? But when it comes to having a pet, your odds of having to live without them in 5-20 years is part of the package. So I hope you remember that your sweet cat was born and going to live for a certain amount of time whether she met you or not, but because she met you she got to live the best life possible. It's always us that are still alive here on Earth who hurt after death. Once someone passes on to the next stage, they feel only contented peace and serenity. A year in our time feels like a second in their time. A long time from now, you will close your eyes and your cat will be the first one to greet you. And as far as your cat sees things, in a few seconds, she will look up and see you."
Petloss,32rjg1,mollination,3,Thu Apr 16 13:45:08 2015 UTC,"just lost one of my cats about 36 hours ago. i dont think anything can take away the sadness and grief, and frankly i dont think anything should. its a testament to the love and bond that you had and thats a really special thing to feel. give it the time that it takes to lessen, and always think about her as she can live on in your heart and memory forever"
Petloss,32rjg1,highpressuresodium,2,Thu Apr 16 15:50:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your loss. It's going to be hard for at least the next few weeks. There is no healthy way to make it any less painful. Pain is representative of the amount of love you had, the more it hurts, the stronger the bond you shared was. You obviously took very good care of her and gave her all the love you could for her to live to that age.  Talk to people when you're ready, I found that helped me a lot when I lost my cat a month ago. I hope you have someone close to you whose shoulder you can cry on. We're here for you too if you want to talk about it with us. Just typing out your feelings can help a bit as well."
Petloss,32rjg1,josh6499,2,Thu Apr 16 06:46:47 2015 UTC,"My good girl was euthanized after 16 years. Did it on the 28th of last month, so a little over three weeks ago.   The pain DOES diminish, but it takes time.   You'll think about your girl every day, and for the first week or two, you will cry.   Let yourself do this. Grieve.  Pull up the pictures you have of her that represent her at her best, and think about that. Then think about the times she pissed you off or made you laugh and all those quiet days where she was diffident (in that particular way cats are..) to your existence.. all of it.  You will miss your girl, but it's okay. The hardest thing will be the cat-shaped hole in your life, and it will jump up at you unexpectedly but each time it does, and you cry about it, the hole closes a bit.  Again, it just takes time.  Regards,"

Losing a pet is a horrible thing to go through. At first the grief is like a shock and you won't feel it but after several days it hits you hard. Don't let others ask you why you're still feeling sad after a while. With pets, the worst part of the grieving process is more than a year. After that, you'll have good days and bad days. I wish you much luck through the grieving process."

Not a lot of things can do that. RIP Vicky."

However, remember that in cases where nothing positive can be done besides prolonging suffering, euthanasia is the best choice we can provide out of a selection of really shitty choices. Your family is especially fortunate to have a plot of land to lay your cat to rest. My condolences to you, and may we all meet our loved ones at Rainbow bridge in the end."

Yes, it's going to hurt very much for a while, that's normal. It'll take some time for the heartbreak to fade and be replaced with happier memories of the good times she gave you.  We have all second guessed that difficult final decision. It's normal to doubt yourself. But you know you made the right decision and that's a selfless act in itself. It's hard to let our pups go and I'm sorry you had to. You didn't abandon her; you were with her until the very end. That takes love and strength. I can assure you, she felt no pain.  I hope you feel better in the days to come."

Petloss,3267xo,ProbablyNotADuck,4,Sun Apr 12 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly what the other posters have already said: just be with her.   I spent my dogs last 24 hours right by his side. We got Indian food, and, even though he'd been refusing to eat for days, he decided to eat some rice. We went for one last slow walk around the neighbourhood, and I let him pick the direction and the pace. We curled up on the couch and watched movies all night long while I held him tight and rubbed his paws. And in the morning, I took him to my parents' house, where he loved to sit on the back step and look out over their yard. I think, if you'd asked him, he would have told you it was a perfect day, but anything would have been perfect for him as long as we were together.   What I did for me though was take video footage of him. I wish I'd gotten more when he'd still been feeling more like himself, but hindsight is 20/20. I got enough of the little things though that it has made this last week without him a little more bearable. He's not here with me anymore, but I can play those videos, brief as they may be, and see his beautiful face and the way his ears perked up when I said his name."

Petloss,3267xo,DepressingBot,3,Sun Apr 12 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"Get her a special blanket or bed and spend these last days with her on the bed.  Just snuggling or talking, being close. You could even move it outside when you want to give her grass time. Then, have the blanket with you when it's time to say goodbye (I prefer now to have a house call for the final appt., but if she doesn't mind the vet then that's ok as well).    Anyway, I did this with my first kitty that passed.  He was sick and dying, and he'd sit on the blanket on my lap for his last couple months (just while watching tv or hanging out).  Then he was on the blanket for his final appt. and I think it was comforting to him. And I had the blanket to hug afterwards when I was devastated and missing him."
Petloss,3267xo,DepressingBot,2,Sat Apr 11 02:28:20 2015 UTC,I really like this idea. She has blankets in her bed that will work perfectly. I probably will never wash them again just so I can smell it and think of her from time to time.

But how beautiful--you comment about how she seemed to know and be at peace with it.   I hope you are as well. You showed how much you love her but thinking of her before yourself. No one wants to have their baby put down, but it really was in Lily's best interested. You did it for her. You showed such love and courage and compassion.   Sending you much support and strength through this difficult time. We are all here for you."
Petloss,31yso6,funkyrabbi6969,3,Thu Apr 9 05:18:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your memory of Duncan with us. You are in good company here. All of us have suffered sometime at least somewhat similar to you.   My recommendation is to write to help yourself work through the grief. It's a great way to start to understand what is going on inside yourself. You can write here i you want, but you can also write just for yourself in a journal or whatever. Just get it out somehow.  You also have your family to lean on which is a blessing. I'm sure everyone misses Duncan so much!   Sending you hugs. You're not alone. We are all with you."
Petloss,31yso6,ForeverFluffy,1 point,Sat Apr 18 23:32:14 2015 UTC,What a beautiful boy!  All we can do is love them for the short time we share our homes and hearts with them.  So sorry.
Petloss,31yex3,a_stitch_in_lime,3,Thu Apr 9 03:08:57 2015 UTC,"Your story brings me to tears. He had a good life, and you took care of him all the while. Take comfort knowing that you had the courage to show him the mercy he deserved. I'm sorry for your loss."
Petloss,31yex3,trtsmb,2,Fri Apr 10 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry I made you cry. It helped immensely to type out my story, read the comforting words of others and also go back and read it a time or two. Thank you for reading. hugs"
Petloss,31yex3,trtsmb,3,Fri Apr 10 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"What a beautiful boy. You did your best for him and the decision to let them go is always followed by guilt, depression, etc. It's never an easy decision to make.  The day will come when you'll go in a Petco and see a kitty that says take me home and love me."
Petloss,31yex3,nanner-puss,2,Thu Apr 9 11:26:13 2015 UTC,Thank you for the kind words. I think my brain knows these feelings are normal but the message hasn't yet reached my heart.
Petloss,31yex3,Jigsaw02,3,Thu Apr 9 15:33:59 2015 UTC,"It will get easier with time. You will always miss him and he'll always have a special place in your heart but when you think of him, it will be happy things."
Petloss,31yex3,Jigsaw02,3,Thu Apr 9 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"He looks so gorgeous. A most regal prince. To be truthful, I sympathize with you.  Honey, please don't guilt yourself. I absolutely understand for this decision, as I just made the same choice hours ago. It is not easy. Putting a pet down just kills someone like nothing before.   I also struggled with taking Lily, my 10yo Miniature Pinscher, home with pain and antibiotics just to hold her more. A dignified, painless death outweighed what I felt was a selfish decision. No living creature, especially one that has been with you that long, deserves pain.  You did the right thing, and it will hurt no matter what, inside of you to have made a decision. Please acknowledge that he really appreciated being held by you during those last moments. I feel the same way with my princess.  Whatever you do, please do not guilt yourself. You did what you felt was best for him. No suffering. Don't hesitate to shoot me an IM, I'm in the same boat."

Petloss,31yex3,lovecats91,2,Fri Apr 10 01:30:19 2015 UTC,"You could not have done anything more. You made the right decision.   It's a heartbreaking fact that we owe it to our pets to do the unthinkable, ask that they be euthanized.   As others have said, in time you will sort out your feelings. You will come to know, in your heart, that you made the difficult decision to do what was best for your baby."
Petloss,31yex3,ListenToTheMusic,2,Fri Apr 10 00:20:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for the comforting words.

The pain can be unbearable, I wanted to share that empathy with someone else in that situation. I don't read every story or comment on every post, but I do what I can because I know how much it helped me. This is a very sweet subreddit."

Petloss,31tfj2,susanshoos,2,Wed Apr 8 21:23:42 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss. Sounds like you had a great companion.  Believe me when I say I totally know the feeling, having gone through the loss of my 16 year old cat on the 28th last month.  You'll find that the sorrow will bite you in unexpected ways - today I came home a bit later than usual, so it was getting dark inside and as I got to the top of the stairs in our apartment, a small box sitting in the hall, caught in the corner of my eye and for a second I thought it was my Celia. She'd often sit near that spot waiting for us to come in and say hi and get a scratch on her head.  Stupid shoe-box.   I lost my shit right then like it was the day after she died, and I'm still raw as I type this to you.   It's the emptiness of one's home when your beloved pet leaves that is the worst.."
Petloss,31r93x,animallover2472004,7,Tue Apr 7 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your loss. I lost my cat on the 16th of March. I had a breakdown on Sunday, it felt like the day after all over again. It's easier now, but I was a mess for a good week and a half and still have moments where I get very sad. I found talking to people helped a lot, especially sympathetic people. Talking on this subreddit helped as well. Moving on I've been praying a lot more and I feel like my life is headed in a new direction now that my best friend is gone.   Read people's posts on here and find someone you can talk to. If you don't know anyone, maybe look up a pet loss support group in your city if possible. Grief counceling is an option and may be included with your health insurance if you have it.   Just remember that the pain you're feeling is absolutely normal and healthy. The more you loved her, the more painful the loss will be. You will carry that pain with you forever, but it will get easier to bare in time. The good thing is you will also carry the love you have for her with you forever as well. The pain is overpowering those feelings for now, eventually the good memories will overpower the painful feelings and when you think of her you will smile instead of cry."
Petloss,31r93x,josh6499,3,Tue Apr 7 23:37:03 2015 UTC,"It's different for everyone, but feelings will settle down in a few months. It took me that long to get over the loss of my first cat, Cat, who disappeared. That was in 1993.   Six years later, I got another girl, Celia the Monster, who made it to 16 and a few weeks before kidney failure forced me to have her euthanized as she was so ill and in such discomfort.   That was on the 28th of March.   I cried for two days, and Thursday last week, was the worst. I got a screaming cold and was super-uncomfortable and in pain - my head was splitting - and there was no cat to turn to for comfort. I'd always go lay down and nap with Celia when I wasn't feeling well, and really came to depend on that soft warm body to curl up next to. I was the most miserable I've been in years - I kept wandering around the house for the longest time just working out what I was doing - I didn't even know I was trying to find the cat. It didn't hit me until my husband got home and I just poured out the days misery and verbalized what I was doing. Today I caught a glimpse of her as I came up the stairs out of the corner of my eye.. it was a shoebox and for a second I thought it was her waiting for me to come home as she used to. Totally lost it again like it was just yesterday she died and not 10 days ago. I miss my good girl.  You'll have days like that, and they're 100% normal and let yourself cry when it rises up. Grief is unpredictable. It comes and goes but each time you cry and let it out, it gets a bit better.  That hole inside you closes eventually, but it takes time."
Petloss,31r93x,foodandart,3,Thu Apr 9 03:38:12 2015 UTC,"Give yourself time, you're not alone OP, I lost my cat not long ago and myself too thought I would never be the same. It's important to think about the best times you had with your cat, in time you will accept it believe me, even though you don't want to at first, it's part of the process and that will ofcourse come with time. Think about the rainbow bridge, such a beautiful poem it left me in tears just reading it. Stay strong OP, lots of love from a fellow cat lover :) Sorry for your loss"
Petloss,31r93x,Pierows,2,Tue Apr 7 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"I think it will go away in time.

Petloss,31qxic,macattack777,4,Tue Apr 7 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"I am so very sorry for your loss.   Saying goodbye is so difficult, but at least you will get to show your puppy that you love him at the end.   We held Elly's paw at the last.  It's a heartbreaking memory, but it would have given her comfort.   The last thing she saw in this world was our love for her.   Give your dog lots of cuddles and strokes and let him eat his favorite food.   The time will pass very quickly, so make every second count.   Pets say that dogs have no concept of ""tomorrow"" / ""the future"" - they live in the here and now.  He's going to a better place where he can be that puppy you'll always remember him as.  As a dog owner, you're honoring your most important pledge to your pet by ending his suffering.  It's unbelievably tough, but it is, sadly, inevitable, whether it be now or sometime in the future.   I will pray for you, OP.   There are no words of comfort I can offer, other than it's a very noble thing to put yourself through this for your beloved pet.    That is true love and not even death can defeat true love.   God bless you and your puppy."

Petloss,31njqb,ladyluck11,2,Tue Apr 7 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the kind words.  and I'm sorry about your baby as well. It's never a good time. I just keep trying to remember the wonderful 15 years we had together when she was happy and not in pain. The end sucks. There's no way to sugar coat it. But the only thing that has helped me so far is knowing that I gave her a great life. She was very happy up until the end. With her kidney failure, she didn't seem to be going downhill, I never would have noticed anything was wrong until she went blind. And then I came home Saturday and I just knew that her time was up. But she'll forever be in my heart and I'll miss her every day."

Petloss,31njqb,DoMeBilly,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:28:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your loss.  I'm guessing she was a Maine Coone? My little best friend Grizzly is also experiencing kidney issues. Shelter said he was about 2 when we got him so now he's somewhere around 13-14. The vet gave us the diagnosis back in June. He gets regular checkups, is going to the bathroom ok, and although he has obviously lost weight he is eating and drinking ok and still has his occasional times of acting like a playful kitten again. There is still a fairly noticeable change in his behavior sometimes though and within the past week it seems as if his fur is just falling out everywhere. He's a Maine Coone so naturally there have always been a few hair clumps around the house but this is different. I am brushing him more than ever now and just took him to get a haircut. I know it could be only a few months until his time comes so every chance I get I cuddle up with him. Really wish there was more the vet could do. If only people pets could live as long as their owners :("

A few days ago I cried during a night out with friends at a bar. 26 year old male here crying in public.  I always told myself I would never let anyone see me cry. Well I completely broke that promise that day. My dad left the garage door open and everything happened so fast...  It feels like this will never end. I felt better during the 2nd and 3rd week, but now I can't stop thinking about her.   I too, felt that there was something I could have done to stop it. I swore to her that I would never let anything happen to her and it just eats me away.   Sorry that my story isn't that helpful, but I just wanted to share my experience. I do believe things will get better, but it will take some time."
Petloss,314ujt,tdatran,1 point,Thu Apr 2 08:12:34 2015 UTC,"Man tears are the worst. I'm 29 and cried like a little baby when the vet told me my 11 yr old husky mix has a liver tumor. I spent 1k so far too find out that it's 20cm in length and they can't tell me if it can safely be removed.   The surgery is 3.5k, and while I don't have that laying around, my main concern is that there is no guarantee that the surgery can help. It can go 1 of 3 ways. They remove it and she recovers. It's too big to remove and I've just caused her more pain for no reason,  or it's a risk to move due to hemmorage and she dies on the table.   She's a bit underweight but besides that she is in good spirits.   I really don't know what to do. If they could guarantee removal without hemmorage I'd do it in a heartbeat. But the thing is huge and I dint want her to die because of my wish to keep her around longer. Hell, it could be cancer and come back or she could die from infection after.   I think I focus too much on the negative....."

Getting rid of her marks made on the house will be hard, and you'll want to cry. Do so. Cry a lot. I found it's helped me a lot with dealing with Jaspers death. Know that your Jasper knew how much you all loved her and I know that she appreciated that. You gave her a dignified passing, and that's the best gift you can give her."
Petloss,310nut,Mehers,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:04:11 2015 UTC,What a beautiful way to say goodbye. Though it's never easy you showed such courage and caring. The image of Jasper being in a circle of flowers and the lullaby--that is one of the sweetest images I can imagine. She must have loved you so much. You're a great example of showing love and respect for our fury friends in their last few moments. So incredibly beautiful.   We are all standing with you. You are not alone.  Sending you warmth and strength during this difficult time.

Then I just clicked and read your story.  My baby was very similar except he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor (did an MRI).  I just got out of the shower, during which I had a hard cry and repeating ""I want my baby back"".   So I can truly empathize with you.  It does get better with time, but it's hard and it sucks.  Some days better than others.  We were able to release our babies from his pain and fear.  They weren't who they once were, nor would they ever return to normal.  Nature always wins.  You were truly blessed to find one another.  Godspeed in your healing process.    He was adorable!  I lost my chihuahua/schipperke cross 1 1/2 years ago to heart failure."

It gets better, but you need to do something to give Robin justice. Definitely make a police report to stop any more innocent, kind animals from falling prey to them. So sorry for your loss once again, and just remember, you have the strength and courage to fight through this. Don't let those scumbags get you down. Cherish your happy memories of Robin."
Petloss,30x5hu,ForeverFluffy,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:16:40 2015 UTC,Thank you for sharing your story. You were right to come here. Many of us here (including myself) have lost a pet to mysterious circumstances. We are here for you. Our shared experience makes us understand and know we aren't alone. There are others who know what you're going through and can sympathize.  I find that writing can be a very healing exercise. You've already started that here.  If you'd like to create a free memorial for Robin: foreverfluffy.com  Your story is so sad. So many of our kitties are taken away from us unfairly. I'm sure it's very hard not to think about what might have happened to her. She sounds like she was just the sweetest. We should all be so privileged to have a cat like Robin.  Thinking of you.

We sadly can't just speak to our cats and have them understand, nor can they just walk up and say ""excuse me, I don't like my new food."" We do the best we can with the information we have, and I know you did everything you could for your sweet baby. Remember that the doctors are doing the best they can, too, and they want to give you the best picture of what may happen that they can. Sometimes, a procedure that saves many cats just might not work for ours. That's no one's fault, though it does hurt terribly when it's time for our loved ones to leave us. Tinker was beautiful and she knew you loved her."
Petloss,30q5p9,ikkidigital,3,Sun Mar 29 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"Totally there with you ikkdigital.   My kitty of 16 years went yesterday and you are going to be gutted for a day or so.. then when you sleep tonight, you may have lucid dreams and wake up looking for your pet. I did four times last night - but in the morning, you'll cry and it will sink in that your adorable pup is gone..   The pain is the most acute right now, but it will abate. If you feel you're getting weepy, let it fly, and after each cry, it does feel a little bit better.   Right now, the feelings of grief are about you, your loss, your emptiness and that is perfectly as it should be. In a few days it starts to lay down a bit, I've cried five times today and earlier I checked up on my girl's little body - it's cold where I am and we're waiting until my husband and I both have time off to dig her grave. I got a jump on it, checked out my kitty-cicle - yup, frozen solid (that or rigor mortis has set in) and she's curled up like she's sleeping and I sized her for the hole we need to dig.. no tears! No sorrow, no pain.. just a bit of sadness that she's not still alive, but NO sadness whatsoever that the discomfort and illness she suffered is over.  Right now, it's all pain and that is 1,000 % normal. You'll always remember your pup, and the pain does go away and in time you're left with the good memories. Would life be so perfect that our pets got as many years to live as we do, but that's not the case. They go on ahead for us as our emissaries into eternity to make it ready for us. Don't worry about Toma, he's having a blast, checking things out before you arrive. Before he knows it, you'll be with him along with all the other pets that have found a place in your heart."

What is years and years for us now, is nothing but a blink of an eye - less than that, actually - and when we catch up with our pets.. they will have just gotten there themselves.  I can't wait to introduce Celia to my first cat Cat, and have the two of them meet Gabby and Watson, who were my mom's pets. And who knows? Maybe once I've calmed down a bit and after a few years when the husband and I have done the traveling we've wanted to do - now guilt-free as we've no animals to worry about at home - we'll have another pet waiting to join us at the Rainbow Bridge."

The vet did you and Jasper a huge kindness and it will feel like you've been gutted - the worst thing is removing the traces of your cat.. when they've been with you that long, everything you see that they used, be it a blanket or their favorite toy.. whatever, just tears at you.

I cried on the way home, on the way to work, going home from work, and before I went to sleep. I just couldn't calm down. But you're right, every time I did cry, I felt a little better.

Cried a hell of a lot over the past three days but I was strong at the vets when the doctor came in and put her out. Was fast and good. A good end, free of the pain she'd been in.   I cry all the time, but each time a little bit less of the pain remains.   If I can say one thing, that is to let it rip if you feel weepy. I know my cat wouldn't give a shit, because well, hello.. cat. But your pup would be worried about you, and you know would want to cheer you up.   Think on that, and cry a bit, but laugh too because where they've gone, they're not having a bad time and really, all the years we have to wait to be with them again, is but a blink of an eye, where they are now."

I've been crying randomly, lashing out, staring at things she used to play with or sleep on, sleeping a lot, etc. The shitty part is I feel like I'm useless and I don't know what to do with myself, but I can't take time off for a cat. That's just not socially acceptable.   What seems to temporarily help is to watch the kitten cam. I don't know why but it soothes me for a bit until I stop watching again. They're just so sweet and even though my cat looked nothing like them, just watching them play makes me feel like there's a future. It's so stupid but true, at least for me."

Petloss,30j2d0,June24th,3,Sat Mar 28 00:04:26 2015 UTC,"My own girl, Celia the Monster had to be euthanized today because of kidney failure. She was very ill the last day - yesterday (Friday) was the last time she meowed for me - her water bucket is in the bathtub and she got in, but was so weak she couldn't get out. I hear her cry at about 3:30 in the morning and went in and fished her out. Put her on the bed with us and she slept the rest of the day. Was so ill that I cried all day but today at the vets, I decided not to lose my shit there, they probably see this too often and I didn't want to make it harder on them than they needed - after all they are people that love animals.  I'll probably cry tomorrow when I break the ground to bury her. I feel very drained and am going to clean my apartment BIG TIME and get all of the cat-hair laden stuff cleaned. Maybe I'll re-arrange the furniture as well. After 16 years, it's time for a change.  I miss my kitty, but I know she's waiting for when my husband and I catch up with her. Your cat is waiting for you too and over the years all the other pets you get will join him and be all together to greet you when you arrive.."

Please someone tell me that I'm not the only one feeling like they've left something shivering and alone that isn't still alive..."
Petloss,30grjy,skaiya,2,Fri Mar 27 07:23:10 2015 UTC,"You're not alone, and I'm sorry for your loss. My cat died a couple of days ago due to complications from a blood transfusion necessary to treat her anemia. We believe she had a hemorrhagic stroke.  I'm still blaming myself. At first, I thought she had died because I didn't chase her pill with some water. Like, maybe the stress of vomiting caused her stroke. But I know that's not it. Hemorrhagic strokes are typically preceded by vomiting, which is unrelated to pills.  Then I blamed myself for taking her home instead of keeping her overnight at the vet for a second night. But I know that they probably would not have been able to do anything about it. Lily was tired but seemed ok when I saw her last, 2 hours before I came home to a dead body.   Then I blamed myself for not taking her to the vet sooner just for a checkup. But they wouldn't have done a blood count anyways, so they probably wouldn't have caught it.  Now I'm blaming myself for not being there when she died. I should have taken time off to baby her, but I had to go to work. I really feel horrible for letting her die alone, though.  The other thing I feel you on is feeling guilty for cremating her. I wish I could bury her on a plot of land, but I live in an apt. complex, and you can't just bury animals on public land. That's not legal. So...I had to cremate her. I kept a clipping of her hair, and stare at it when I'm feeling especially low. I feel like a crazy person, but grieving is not rational. Hopefully you have someone there to ride it out with you and to be your shoulder or punching bag when you feel like you're going to implode with grief. My thoughts are with you."
Petloss,30grjy,Cookiesallnight,4,Sat Mar 28 02:03:39 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry for your loss.  I have lost a cat but he wasn't mine. He was a stray cat I used to feed. He was very sick so I contacted a rescue and asked for their help to pay for the vet. They said ok and when I took the cat in, they euthanized him after finding out he had FIV (cat HIV). I didn't know that this rescue's policy was to euthanize stray cats that were FIV in order to protect other stray cats from the epidemic.  I felt so guilty afterwards. I kept thinking about how we caught him, about the last moments I saw him alive, about how he was trying to look outside from into the crate.  It's been a year and I still feel guilty. Even if it was better for him as he was so sick blood was literally coming out of his eyes, and his breathing sounded terribly heavy  I had crushing guilt about thinking his last moments were at the vet. I had crushing guilt about thinking he was now in a cold vet morgue. I was feeling guilty he didn't die at home. I was feeling guilty because he spent his last days waiting to be seen by a vet in a place he didn't know anything about.  You will stop having those thoughts but it will take some time. I guess you would have had them regardless of any situation leading to his death.  Please find solace in knowing that he died loved and at home. He was loved and he knew it."

Petloss,30grjy,ClassicCarLife,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:26:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a little late, but guilt is usually an emotion riddled with lies.  I don't know the while story, but I do know from the little that's here you loved that chixken and gave it a life millions of times better than most all of its brethren. What you did to save him, nurture him, and show you care no doubt resonated with him.  Hold onto the good memories and laugh at the next chicken you see for the goofiness you saw in your friend. At worst your friend feels no pain and the ground and the weather don't make a difference anymore to him.  Take comfort in the thought of no more pain, and the knowledge that any possible missteps you think you made had no bearing on your loss. Keep saving animals and know your actions make a difference for the better."

Petloss,30cet8,kittydreamer,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:44:53 2015 UTC,"I have a similar story with my dog Gizmo. My husband's parents originally had him and when they divorced, his mother basically went bat shit crazy. Stop caring for any of the animals, didn't care if they had food, left home to travel in a semi with the new boyfriend of each week. When I found out about this, coupled with the fact that Gizmo was living indoors in a trailer with no heat, we brought Gizmo home. It didn't look like he had long to live. He was sleeping a lot and had to be carried to his food. He was about 16 at that time I think. We brought him home and got him Vet attention and showed him love and he flourished. Glucosamine and Chondroitin made him like a puppy again. We had him for another 7 years, I think? It just goes to show you how much love can really do to make an animal want to live again. To this day, he is the best dog we have ever had."

Petloss,303z0e,blindlinsanity,4,Tue Mar 24 07:39:08 2015 UTC,Sorry for your loss.   But you need to deal with this person. That abusive / possessive / aggressive behaviour that you describe combined with threats to kill animals and violence is part of the path to property damage and your friend / family ending up seriously injured or dead.   You don't need your mom dead because this person decided to light your mom's place on fire.
Petloss,303z0e,catherinecc,2,Tue Mar 24 09:20:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  And thank you for taking the time to read that mess and reply.  I completely agree. I am still going to see if we can get restraining order, but I believe there is nothing else I can legally do. I know I can't confront him in person as I'd probably kill him with my bare hands, and he isn't worth losing my freedom.   My mother and I told my friend what the vet said and that we really want her to be safe, but I don't know if she will ever leave him. I don't know what I can do for her other than tell her grandmother (who they are both staying with as far as I know) what happened and for their safety to not allow him there. I'm afraid this would only backfire though, and I dont want to put more people at risk.  Luckily they had no keys to our home and I have changed our garage code. She doubts they will be back, but I'm worried if he snapped once, who knows what he is capable of doing. Unfortunately, it seems like there is nothing we can do other than call 911 if he shows up violent. If they just show up and arent violent there is apparently nothing we can legally do as this was their residence. They can claim they just left for a few days, even with all of their belongings, and just come back. I'm sorry this has kind of drifted. Now that I have some sleep, I'm going to look for a good subreddit for any legal advice just in case we missed something we can do. If you can suggest any I would appreciate it.

While they were gone, the guy alone stabbed her cat to death and there was blood everywhere. They came back and and had to see it. He was arrested.   It is murder.

And for the cherry on top, my (ex)friend is still with him after what he did. I think since nothing legal happened she assumes we were lying and he is innocent.

I always thought when my cat was alive that if anyone ever did anything to him, I would lose it and become homicidal. Luckily I never had to worry about it. What he did was absolutely unforgiveable. I don't know if you're spiritual or religious. Karma is real though, he will suffer for that, but it's not your job to make that happen. If you're christian, remember that the Bible says, ""Vengeance belongs to the Lord."" I have always tried to turn the other cheek, and I always find out people who have wronged me end up paying dear prices. I don't want to give examples, but God is very reliable when it comes to this, but it only works if you let him (or karma) deal with it.

To help get out of the grieving, was thinking about what my cat(s) liked... and me crying and being sad and despondent was NOT what they liked.  To honor my cat's lives I needed to be happy and go live my life.  My cats lived long lives and this caused me to think, ""What if that little soul in there were me... How long would I want to exist as a cat for?  Trapped in a tiny furry body, no fingers, limited communication...""  I hope to see my pets again, you know- over there, and I expect I may see that they are so much more than could be contained in the cat bodies they occupied.  Also, a wise woman once told me that it is not fair to our hearts to attach them to animals like we would with a child.  With their shorter life span we are almost certain to see them perish.

I couldn't bring myself to start a final video for my own dog (even though I knew I wanted to make one before he passed) until two years had passed, and soon after it was finished I felt much better. Whenever you're feeling down, you can watch the video and have a happy-cry/sad-smile."

Petloss,2zpk8g,awtfpost,4,Fri Mar 20 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"Open your home.  It may not be your fault.  Lilies are a common plant that is toxic to the kidneys, but usually cats get sick after simply chewing on a leaf.  I'm a veterinary pathologist that sees a lot of cat kidneys and honestly I think it's mostly poor dental health that causes their kidneys to fail by constantly showering the kidneys with bacteria.  Just my hypothesis as I see microscopic changes of inflammation in a lot of cats, even those without reported kidney disease.  I just lost my cat two weeks ago to the same thing.  With cats it seems it's either their kidneys that go, they have an enlarged heart, or they get cancer.  Nature always wins.  You gave them a good life.  You can give another cat a chance at a good life."
Petloss,2zpk8g,a_tad_mental,1 point,Sat Mar 21 03:51:38 2015 UTC,"thanks for posting - it means a lot coming from someone with your clinical exposure, cat care and recent loss experiences.  assuming your observation have merit, if there is an important correlation between dental bacteria and kidney stress, how early would you recommend cats go in for descaling, checking for gum inflammation etc.  as most people I talk to wait till the cats are older or mouth stress symptomatic.  assuming you can get your cat to cooperate, are these home test any use for early detection? http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BLNR0ZI/ I know humans use similar strips to test their urine at home for a dozen different indicators."
Petloss,2zpk8g,stonecats,3,Sat Mar 21 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"Of course the best thing is to brush a cats teeth, but most of us don't like to get mauled on a daily basis (although I know 2 people who have cats that love it).  Every cat's mouth is different (saliva, type of bacteria) so how often their teeth has to be scaled varies.  You can check their mouth to see if their gums are red or if they have dental calculus. Anesthesia is a risk, so that needs to be taken into account too.  Most cats should probably get their first cleaning around 3-4 years old, then maybe every 1-2 years after that.  It's expensive and there's risk, so you have to take that into account for the decision to have their teeth cleaned.  As for the strips, those special pet ones are just like the human ones, so you can get whichever is cheaper (protein for kidneys, glucose for diabetes, blood and leucocytes/white blood cells for urinary tract infection).  The problem for kidney disease and diabetes, once you see those things in the urine the process is already to a point that the organs are quite dysfunctional.  I recommend, and it's what I do for my own, getting bloodwork on a cat at age 5-6. If it's normal, 1. You have a baseline, 2. You can repeat at age 8 or 9.  After 10 it's best to get bloodwork yearly but it's pricey and stressful for the pet so every 2 years is fine.  And even though I'm a vet I do understand costs.  Since I'm a pathologist I don't have access to clinical equipment, nor are my clinical skills once what they were so I actually take my pets to a vet 😃. I just understand and know what they need.  Probably could draw blood on a cat but it's best to have a someone who does it on a daily basis.  No need for unnecessary trauma.  Oh and some breeds just have bad kidneys.  Persians are one (not all, but high incidence)."

Petloss,2zoa46,tdatran,2,Fri Mar 20 06:16:05 2015 UTC,"hi there, i came across this post randomly while searching for something else and i felt compelled to write. i hate that you didn't get many responses here, but i suspect that no amount of responses can take away what you're feeling.  first of all, i am so, so sorry for the loss of your sweet girl. i can understand what you are going through. my 11 month old cat (who i had from 3 weeks old, she was a feral barn cat) was hit by a car a few weeks after i moved to a new home after my college graduation. it seems so cruel and senseless, even now if i let myself think back on it. like you, i wasn't there for her last moments. my brother found her body a few hundred yards away from my house and he knew it wouldn't be good for me to see her. my sweet neighbor buried her that day.  this happened in 2007 and not a week goes by that i don't think of her, of what my life would be like if my little buddy was still here. three years ago, i adopted another cat. a stray that found its way to me and it's been the best thing for my heart. nothing will make sense of what happened to your sweet girl. nothing will make it any less confusing or unfair. make room for that grief and accept it. don't be scared of it and don't try to avoid it, but don't drag yourself through it over and over again. time is the best healer. you won't realize it as it's happening, but soon, day by day, you'll feel just a little bit lighter. it's not that your sadness is going anywhere, it's just changing a little. you'll start to think of good memories of your girl. you'll be reminded of her and it will take longer for that pang to hit. you'll be able to talk about her without thinking of her death, without crying. it may take a year. it may take three. it may take more. one thing it shouldn't do is close you off from loving another creature. that's been such a healing thing for me, even nearly ten years later. i wish you all of the best. <3"

I have to live with the image for the rest of my life. I've adopted a new dog from the local shelter here. As much joy as she brings to me I still feel like something is missing.   My heart sinks every time I think of her. I think it's the guilt that holds me back. I promised her I would never let anything happen to her. I just can't forgive myself yet for what happened even though it was out of my control.

She was an outdoor dog as my dad didn't want an animal in the house, but she loved being outside. We had an acre fenced in so she had a lot of room to run in.  She's 11 now, just turned it in February. She's got a tumor on her liver that's pushing on her stomach and diaphragm. She was keeping food down at the vet during observstiom, but now she isn't.  I'm having to fave a tough decision. My dad doesn't want to put the dog down, but she's mine so ot comes down to what I wantt. If I choose that route, he doesn't want to be there and I understand that. My dad is too proud to cry in front of stranger or his kids. And seeing that dog be put to sleep would Def do it. I'm sure he as cried at the house by himself....if not....he's a lot stronger than I am.  I'm sitting at my house trying to put off going to my parents. I don't want to see her all tired and sick. I know what the vet is going to tell me....and I don't want to be there alone for this shit.  Okay....enough reddit for today.  I hope the pain eases for you soon enough.

Is there any way your vet could offer you a reduced rate or allow you to pay on installment for proper medical care? Is there a friend or relative who could loan you the money to get her seen by a vet? I don't want to make you feel worse but she could be at risk of going into shock or getting an infection. How about contacting a local shelter to find out if they have any suggestions? I am NOT a vet so cannot offer qualified medical advice. However, from my experience as a dog owner, wrapping her in a warm blanket may help to reduce the risk of shock. I hope she does better soon."

Petloss,2zkj27,afikfikfik,4,Thu Mar 19 09:53:08 2015 UTC,"I had a very similar living situation, when I suddenly lost my first dog, Jill.   My reaction was initially very similar.  She was a lab mix and a ""velcro dog"" so she was always near me whenever she could be.  If I was washing dishes, she was lying by the oven.   If I was watching TV, she'd be on the sofa.  If I was in the shower, her nose was pushed against the bathroom door.   Bone cancer struck, and I only knew how serious the problem was for one day, then she was gone.  It would have been wrong to try to replace my best friend with ""another dog"", so I never considered doing that.   But while I was grieving, I didn't think it made sense to have to stare at all the empty spaces she used to occupy in an otherwise lonely home.  So I tried fostering rescue dogs.  I could not recommend this highly enough for someone in your position.  This is not a replacement for your friend, because it's a temporary home for a pup in need.  When a family adopts him, he moves on.  The wonderful thing about this for me is that it broke the cycle of ruminating on what was lost, and let me focus on something positive and feel great about doing something to help a dog in need.  It really was the main force that got me through a massive loss.  I helped about 13 dogs over the next year and half, and eventually found I could not give up the one I was with...so I finally adopted again.  Jill's picture is still up by the door we go out for walks, and every few months, I have to stop there think about what a great pal she was, and how much I miss her presence, but I'm comfortable now.  That seems like a healthy level of grief for the loss of a great friend."
Petloss,2zkj27,flignir,4,Thu Mar 19 11:47:31 2015 UTC,"It's not normal, no, but neither is having such a good friend. I worry sometimes that I will be this way when my dog passes, and I have thought about it, assuming that time heals all things. Apparently that isn't always the case. Maybe you should try moving away from places, people, and things that remind of you her. Normally that would be considered fairly drastic for the death of an animal, but, again, she was clearly much more than that, and you can't continue to have this quality of life. If I were in your position, I'd feel I owed it to myself and the memory of the good times I've had with my dog to be happy again, no matter what that took.  Also, it's worth considering that you might have a serious underlying mood disorder that was just triggered by her death, and which her death continues to exacerbate. I don't mean to minimize the meaning of her life or your time together - you should feel as sad as you did when you lose someone so special, but maybe the length of your experience is abnormal.   This is just a suggestion - a good one or very bad one depending on the person - maybe you should volunteer at an animal shelter, visit a dog park with friends, or even foster a dog. Something non-committal that wouldn't be an effort to replace Coffee, but would still remind you of the good times and the emotional bonding, just to give you some temporary help at healing.  I really hope you can find happiness again. You don't deserve the amount of misery you're experiencing. She looks so happy in the picture of you together, and the picture is just incredible - most people don't get to experience that in a lifetime. You are so lucky - I know that feeling myself - but it's that feeling of knowing you've got something so good that makes it so hard to let it go."

Petloss,2zkj27,AntiDrugs_encourages,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"I lost my dog 3 years ago - Christmas Eve 2011. He developed diabetes and struggled with it for 2 years before that. Seeing him slowly struggle with the disease was horrible. We never thought he was suffering enough to put him down though, and he unexpectedly passed late Christmas Eve. I seriously compare his death to the same level of mourning as when I lost my Grandparents. He was my baby. I picked him out when I was in 8th grade and he got me through high school, college, boy problems, etc, etc, etc. He was my best friend. It was horrible. The loss and sadness is, as you could imagine, indescribable. But in all seriousness - the BEST thing I did to help console, was to adopt a puppy a year later. I felt horribly guilty. I felt like I was ""cheating"" on him or making him think in doggy heaven that I was tossing him away. But getting another dog is NOT a replacement. It is an addition, or spreading the love that Coffee left behind. Look up the dog loss poem ""The Love I Left Behind"". A HUGE part of having a dog is having a partner and a companion. That might be part of what you feel like you're missing most right now. Coffee will NEVER be forgotten. But maybe you could honor her by getting a puppy that you can experience the same or new things with, be another companion and grow a new relationship with. It has helped me tremendously. My current pup is amazing. And sometimes I swear that I see some traits of my last dog in her. It makes me happy and sad at the same time. Someday, maybe soon or years from now, a moment you had with Coffee will cross your mind and instead of cry, you will smile. And that's completely ok."
Petloss,2zkj27,fuzz0725,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:11:20 2015 UTC,"Aww, she was beautiful!  I know you don't want to go to a psychiatrist but it seems you may be ""stuck"" in the grieving process.  I've had years of therapy and at first I was really reluctant to go or start meds.  I had an excellent psychiatrist (takes effort to find the right one btw, I usually go through 2-3 every time I move, you have to have one that you trust), when it came to meds I really didn't want to start them but she told me ""when you see someone with a broken leg do you think less of them for using crutches?  Meds just help you until you can walk on your own again"".  Me - 2.5 years on, been 8 years since I've been off.    They can help you determine the reason you're having difficulty moving on.  Is it because you feel guilt for not being able to save her? I don't know if you had an autopsy performed but it may have been cancer.  Unfortunately golden retrievers are highly prone to cancer, one of them being hemangiosarcoma,  it's a tumor of blood vessels and unfortunately most often diagnosed after it ruptures and the pet is dying or has died.  All cancers are horrible but I think this one is one of the worst because usually owners don't have time to come to terms with the diagnosis.  I actually think getting another dog might help.  They make you feel needed and loved.  It's not a replacement for Coffee, there will never be a replacement, but a fellow canine of Coffee's that you can give a great life to, as you did with Coffee.  I would visit shelters and adoption events to see if you can find that pup that just ""clicks"".  I've only ever wanted 1 dog, but several just ""landed at my doorstep"".  At my max I had 5 chihuahuas, a cat, and 2 horses.  Over the last 2 years I've lost a horse, 3 dogs, and a cat.  One dog 3 months ago (my baby) and last week a dog and a cat.  Right now I'm not ready to get another pet, but if one tugs at my heartstrings, they may have a new home.  By the way, you never fully heal from losing that unconditional love, it's so great it leaves a giant hole in your heart.  It does slowly heal, it's all about finding that new normal.  Getting another pet for that unconditional love does help fill the hole.  My stoic WW2 veteran grandfather still teared up at 84 years of age when he spoke about his childhood pet.  That's going to be me and I'm okay with that.    Godspeed in your healing.  I think it may just take a change in the way you process her loss, and a little counseling wouldn't be so bad."

Brodie got diagnosed with cancer today. And he's not doing well. It's just came all of the sudden. I guess what I'm trying to say but having trouble is that with Goldens cancer comes and takes them away so quick. Sometimes there's just no signs. There is nothing we could have done to prevent this. It's just their time. Don't feel guilty. You can get another dog, and while it won't replace yours, I'm sure you will be able to enjoy the sunset again.

Petloss,2zkj27,Xuandemackay,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"Hi, I think everyone responds differently to loss so IMO there's no right and wrong about your reaction. However the death of your dog has clearly had a long-term effect on your well being to the degree that you're seeking advice on how to deal with it. I think it takes courage to reach out for help so well done. Have your friends, family or partner been supportive of you? And have you considered some counselling, which doesn't necessarily need to involve medication as far as I know, perhaps bereavement counselling? Anyone can need some extra help sometimes. You could also try helplines like The Samaritans (or the US equivalent) to talk about what's going on and how you're feeling. I lost my beloved dog in 2013 after 13.5 years so I have some idea of what you're going through. I kept myself busy and kept talking about the loss, which helped, and sometimes it still hurts but time is a healer. Good luck"
Petloss,2zkj27,chacharocks,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:57:55 2015 UTC,"I think you really should consider getting another dog! I just lost my dog a month ago and have been talking about it with friends- one friend said that when his dog died, he couldn't imagine getting another dog, but his girlfriend really wanted one so he reluctantly agreed, and it turned out to be the most helpful thing for him getting over his pet's death.   You are obviously very capable of being a fantastic pet owner. Think of how rewarding it could be for you to have a relationship with a dog again; Someone to come home to, someone to play with outside on nice days. Think of all of the weird and endearing quirks a new pet would have- completely different Coffee, reminding you that this is a new pet and not a replacement for Coffee.   For me, the hardest thing has been these nice days in New York the past few weeks. A month ago it was below freezing and my dog hadn't had a walk in weeks. Now, it's warm and sunny and she isn't here to enjoy it. It seems so unfair. I miss her every day and would do anything to have her back, but ultimately know that building a new relationship with another dog will be rewarding as well, and this possibility is exciting to me.   While I know that my dog was the best dog on the planet, and there is no way that a new dog could ever match her, I also realize how lucky I was to spend 7 years with her- a once-in-a-lifetime type of dog. I'm totally fine with a new dog being only half as great- that would still make me happy."

There is no normal. No too long or too soon. I think your bereavement may have tipped over into depression. I have lost 3 of my dogs in 3 years. I have also suffered from depression and anxiety. Having experienced both, I think you may be suffering from the latter. The fact that the joy has been sucked out of your life sounds like the lethargy that creeps up with depression. Please speak to your Doctor. Help is out there. Many doctors will prescribe meds, but I'd only take them as part of a therapy programme, including talking therapies. I am using both just now. I couldn't live without either. I hate being out of control of my emotions. You deserve to live your life and be happy.  Xx"

Petloss,2zkb3i,ToastedEnder,1 point,Thu Mar 19 09:35:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that made me laugh a bit. Maybe if I had been taking Rider to the vet for yearly check ups, this could have been avoided. That's something I will definitely do should I ever adopt another pet, along with buying health insurance for them."
Petloss,2zj0y9,MyBobaFetish,5,Wed Mar 18 23:44:55 2015 UTC,"You're dealing with it the way you need to deal with it, as long as there's no harm to yourself or others.  Unconditional love is a powerful thing and when it's taking away it hurts like hell.  Eventually you'll find that new normal.  You both were lucky to find one another.  I'm sorry for your loss and Godspeed in your healing."

Petloss,2zj0y9,a_tad_mental,2,Sat Mar 21 18:37:19 2015 UTC,No worries about the delayed response.  I just picked up the ashes of my 2 pets that I ended up having to euthanize 6 days apart.  It's difficult and everyday has its own challenges.

Petloss,2zj0y9,afikfikfik,3,Thu Mar 19 02:03:55 2015 UTC,Im so sorry to hear about your loss. I lost my dog a few hours ago and it's really painful loosing an animal you love. My sammy actually looks just like your zorro. I couldn't sleep so i turned to reddit as well i guess it's just nice to get your feelings out there. I hope that with time it is easier to remember the good times and heal.
Petloss,2zj0y9,TotesMessenger,2,Fri Mar 20 05:31:10 2015 UTC,"I am very sorry for your loss. There is nothing anyone can say to make it better. I wish you patience. I wish you the ability to cope. You have another friend, that will surely help. Cherish his memory and try to be well. It's not my place to give out advice, I know, but I hope you can go through it better."
Petloss,2zgqq6,neverxx,3,Wed Mar 18 13:28:11 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. I had to put my dog (my ""dog brother"") down a year ago on Friday; while he was my 2nd dog, like you that was the first time I had to euthanize. I don't know how much of it is our connection to them vs the euthanizing itself, but it's hard, especially afterwards (even while knowing it was the best option for them). It took me most of last year to bounce back, and that involved a round of deep depression for half of the year, so it'll probably take time.   This whole modern idea that we bounce back within a few days or a week... I just don't think that's reality. The Victorians did their mourning for months and years, and morbid as they were, I think they were healthier about it than modern culture is. So take your time, however long it takes.   As for whether it's bad for your other two cats to be around you in your grief, IMO it's probably good/normal. Like, they're family, and I'm not sure if they'll connect your grief with the reason, but either way, at least they'll have the option to comfort you if they're up for it.   On the inevitability of loss... I mean that's the thing, if we live long enough, we lose everything along the way. The people/family (including pets) we love, the time and places we love, our looks, our health, our ability to take care of ourselves and our independence, our ability to enjoy life without pain and limitations, everything. And there's no guarantees that our losses will come in the 'right' order or that we'll get all the time we want before we lose what we love. That's just the way of life, and it sucks, but there's really no way around it.   The way I deal with it is living in the short term, in the day-to-day, trying every day to spend quality time with the people/animals/places/things/activities I love. With cold rational stuff like financial planning and career goals I think 5+ years ahead, but with emotional stuff I've learned to keep that horizon short, because there are no guarantees, and because there is that inevitability that just brings the feeling of loss before its time. Feel the loss when you have to, pack in all the good times and good feelings now. (Not literally now as you're in mourning, but 'now' as in the short term)."
Petloss,2zgqq6,slapchopsuey,2,Wed Mar 18 16:04:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment. It rings incredibly true for me. Your advice is good, not just during this time, but for life in general, I think. Will try my best to follow it :)"
Petloss,2zgqq6,SilverSpooky,3,Wed Mar 18 19:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss. I was in a similar situation, kind of still now. I had 3 cats and one had to be put down last year. He was my first cat (that was mine and not just a family cat) and he was also the one who cuddled / liked being picked up out of the 3. I also feel bad because my other 2 cats each got along well and snuggled with him but they've never liked each other that much.   So... I try to make the most of our time. If I'm sad about Spooky I talk to the other cats and say ""do you miss him too?"" or something like that. I know it sounds a little weird but it helps me and it may help you. I pet them a lot and I got a feliway wall plugin to help them get along better. I try to make more time for playing with them and grooming them and giving treats. Things like that."
Petloss,2zgqq6,SilverSpooky,2,Wed Mar 18 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing. Hm, I will give talking to them a shot and will purposely try to give them more attention. The other cats were definitely disoriented for the first few days, but they seem to be moving on. I actually just got a Feliway diffuser but haven't gotten a chance to try it out yet."
Petloss,2zgqq6,josh6499,3,Wed Mar 18 20:04:49 2015 UTC,It has helped mine - they tend to find and swat at each other. Lately they don't cuddle but they will sit in the same chair - inches apart.

Petloss,2zfirz,Gromby,2,Wed Mar 18 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"Aww he was such a handsome man.  I just want to let you know grieve how you need to grieve as long as it doesn't hurt you or others.  Unconditional love is strong and when it's ripped away, it hurts like hell.  Over time things get easier but it's never the same, it's all about finding that new normal, and it will eventually come.  My stoic grandfather, who had his appendix taken out with no anesthesia during WWI, at the age of 85 still teared up when talking about his childhood dog. Crying is natural, it helps to deal with the pain."

Petloss,2zdix3,Rencas79,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"I just lost my dog today, and I can't imagine what you are going through. I came here to share my condolences, and 2 small pieces of advice. First please hug your dog and let them enjoy their last days. My girl was 15 but she suddenly got sick last night and I had to put her to sleep without a real good bye. That being said, if you'd kids are strong enough, let them join you at the vet. I know they will cry and be a mess but so will you and it's part of human nature. I lost a dog at 7 or so and I still wish I could have been there at the end instead of being left at a friend's house. It's part of life and I think your kids will enjoy being able to be there for Koda as he passes on to a better place. Be strong but don't be afraid to show how you really feel."
Petloss,2zdix3,DWolford32,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I'm fortunate that I've got a flexible job that lets me take some time to spend with him these last couple of days.  My daughter took it much better than I expected...there were a lot of tears of course, but she understand that it was better to let him go now rather than have him suffer.    I've been really struggling with this decision, wondering if it's the right thing to do...just like most people in my position do.  However, when my dad came over last night, Koda didn't even get up to go to the door to greet him, and that's when I realized that it is definitely the right thing to do.  I'm going to miss the hell out of him, but it's the right thing to do."
Petloss,2zekoj,minutephyicusia,2,Tue Mar 17 22:44:54 2015 UTC,We do for our loved ones what they would do for us if we were in the same circumstances.  Your Sookie who loves you as you do her with her entire being would not let you suffer.   She would see you in your body that is completely failing and let you go in peace.  She would be there for you.  She would put you first above all else and put her love for you first in giving you the peace you so richly deserve.  You can do no less for her dear self now.  Holding you both in my heart and thoughts.
Petloss,2zekoj,tinyirishgirl,2,Tue Mar 17 23:25:21 2015 UTC,"I had to put my cat to sleep this morning. I wanted her to make it to summer so we could enjoy the nice weather.  My cat was a good companion for 14 years. The last few years there were some medical problems that we managed, and I'm glad I took the time to extend her life. My cat and I enjoyed those years.  Before her last vet appointment I knew she was weakening because of her lessening activity. The vet told me she was developing heart problems. I tried to manage the problems, but with two serious health problems there was only so much I could do. Still she was enjoying our usual routine.   She ate essentially nothing the last 5 days. She also wasn't drinking enough. I could tell she was losing weight and dehydrated. She was having trouble walking, both in balance and ability to move more than 4 feet. She was wheezing. I carried her around, going to places I knew she liked. I petted her a lot. We spent some time outside in the nice weather.   The last couple days I spent a lot of time trying to comfort her, but her condition was getting worse, so this morning I took her in to be put to sleep. The staff were very nice and consoling and I believe I did the right thing. My cat was having trouble breathing and dying because you can't breath is a hard way to go.  When you say your dog hasn't eaten in 5 days and has labored breathing, I'm thinking those probably indicators that there's not much time left. You can ask your vet if you have doubts. This breed usually has a lifespan of 10 to 12 years, so she's lived a full life. I think an animal that can't properly breath or eat is not comfortable. You should not feel that you are taking a life into your own hands. At this point your only choice is what kind of end she will have. She can fall asleep quietly, or she can have a longer, more difficult end.   I'm a grown man and I cried before and after and will probably cry some more, so you can cry too. It can be harder when you are by yourself, but you will make it. Perhaps you could write out a memorial about all the good times you had with her."
Petloss,2zekoj,maninlake,1 point,Wed Mar 18 07:34:27 2015 UTC,"I know it's hard but something you need to realize is she's not going to get better, only worse.  I've lost 3 pets in 3 months (2 in the last week) and it's never an easy, straightforward decision.   There's never a ""right"" or ""best"" time to relieve them of their suffering because it sucks to have to let them go.    This is my feeling, dogs live to eat, be safe, and be with their ""pack"".  When they are suffering everyday we keep them here for our selfish desires.  I probably, actually I now know, I kept all mine alive longer than I should have, but I needed to be ready too.  It just took awhile for my heart to come in line with my head and even then my heart was not totally with the idea of letting them go.  I don't know her exact situation but increased breathing effort can be a sign of pain.  All mine had increased respiratory effort, which I tried to control with pain meds, but in the end I just asked myself ""what am I doing?  They're not going to get better, only worse.  What am I prolonging?""  After I realized this, still took me a week or two to let them go.  Whatever decision you come to is best for you and Sookie.  Also it's not you doing this, it's nature trying to take her away.  You just have the ability to limit her amount of suffering."

We're lucky to have had our dogs for a long time. I also missed a midterm today because my dog's condition worsened suddenly. You're definitely making the right choice by choosing to take your midterms even though I'm sure it's really hard. And it's good that you'll be able to be with Mac while he takes the trip to the vet, at least. Try not to feel guilty about it. My brother wasn't able to see my dog go because he works full time in a neighboring city and I know how guilty he feels. But my dog loved him and he loved her and you love your dog and he loves you so it's ok.  Sorry. I don't even know if this is helpful and I'm honestly writing out this message for me as much as I'm writing it for you.

Petloss,2yzjb4,NK1337,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:47:51 2015 UTC,"My dog Penny passed away on the 25th. Nothing makes me feel better but this post did. I always referred to Penny as the little Bitch as a joke. She was super independent and never wanted to be held or cuddle. She would let you cuddle with her or be held for about 5-10 sec then she would give you exactly 3 kisses and try to wiggle away. Sometimes she would have a strained smile like she didn't want to be held but was enjoying the love.  This is weird but my dog had a Facebook page I created as a joke because she had such an express face and we would photo shop pictures of her on the JAWS poster etc. It's makes me feel sad but better in a weird way writing her Facebook inboxes. No one but me can see them and it's like I'm telling her how I feel in a weird psychological way. Maybe she can write her letters to? Also I'm going to grief counseling for Penny so if I pick up any other hints I'll help you know but my friends bought me this as a joke but seriously to help me feel better a cuddle clone. I haven't received it yet but the fact they did that and made a gofundme page to pay for it meant a lot. You can also feel free to PM. I've realized sometimes I just want to talk about the way I feel or just tell someone anyone that I miss her but I find myself holding it in. If you want you can just PM me. It also might be nice for you to just cry about it with your sister. My boyfriend is being really strong as supportive but part of me wishes he could show me if he was upset about Penny so I would feel like someone else was going through this with me. A lot of people loved her but not as much as me. Penny was my daughter, my partner, my best friend. I'm not embarrassed to say I loved her more than anything I would give anything for just one hour even if it was only to wake up early in negative degree weather to take her outside.

My gf and I recent got a puppy and it's hard looking at him without thinking about Nina.     I still remember that despite how independent she was, she was still a big baby at heart. When we used to all live together she would always wake me up at the crack of dawn. She wouldn't bother anybody else but me. For some reason she would always come into my room and put her head on my bed in front of mine, and sigh waiting for me to get up and Follow her downstairs.     Eventually I would start closing the door so I could try and sleep in, but that didn't stop her. She found that if she pawed at the edge of the door just right, it would pop open. So sure enough I would hear faint scratches and wake up to her sitting and staring at me. She was my little morning buddy."

I have trouble waking up in the morning and mine was food crazy (corgis don't have the enzyme that tell them when their full so their always starving). She slept in my bed and every morning she would put her nose next to mine to see if I was awake. Then she would lick my face. If that didn't work she would start growling. If that didn't work she would start barking. If that didn't work she would start walking on me and digging her feet into my stomach. Finally if that worked and I still wanted five more min of sleep then I would put her outside my room where she would body slam my door with her entire body, according to my roommate. So the room shacking would force me to get up. Also this entire process was not 30 min but 5 min. She was also not a patient dog. She needed her breakfast and she needed it now. But it was cute that she would first try with a kiss before unleashing the Kraken."

Petloss,2yuxes,Lostpetthrowaway,1 point,Fri Mar 13 00:41:55 2015 UTC,if you have been to the vet and the meds are enough to handle the pain all you can do is love him. try warm milk when he wakes up.

Petloss,2yuxes,Charlotte-1993,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly,  nothing will prepare you for saying goodbye to your best friend. My pooch was put to sleep a week ago today. He hadn't been himself the last six months of his life, so we thought we'd prepared ourselves for when it was time.  He'd had a stroke but he went for a check up a Week after after getting Jim checked out, the vet said he was still wobbly but he had definitely improved as his eyes weren't spinning anymore. Apparently strokes affect dogs differently and isn't uncommon for them to completely recover. He was pretty old so we just took each day as it came.  Anyway, my parents went away for a reunion with my dad's army friends a few hours away up north and I was at my boyfriends. My little sister rang me to say his back legs had completely seized up and she couldn't move him.  I drove over and there he was, just lying, shaking on the floor. Not even a twitch in his tail when he saw m. (His eyes and ears were affected by the stroke so he seemed almost totally deaf and blind, but he alays knew when you came in). I picked him up and held him like a baby all the way to the vets. He's not even a little dog but I couldn't put him down until we got there.  I placed him, wrapped in his blanket on the bed on the floor and from there it seemed to just blur. The vet diagnosed that he probably had tumours everywhere. His liver as his belly was bloated. His lungs as his breathing was raspy, and his brain, which probably caused his stroke. I just remember crying and feEling his spine and ribs which had started to become more prominent over the past couple of weeks.  Had to sign that I gave consent and choose what to do with him once he'd passed away.   Then I sat on the floor as they placed the catheter in his leg. Not even a flinch. It's like he was completely numb. Then they came back and I stroked his nose as he took his last breath. He's the only pet I've ever owned and I didn't know what to expect. He just drifted off to sleep, so peacefully.   He did have a wee as his muscles relaxed, but the vet said there was a chance  of him emptying his bowels too. I'm glad he didn't. She also said that old brain signals could cause him to convulse, but he didn't do that either. I think because he had a tumour on the brain, it was quite damaged (he would fall over and walk in to things. He also became even more obsessed with food after the stroke and seemed a little different, but still a loving character).   I'm sorry, I wish I could say it'll get better, but the only thing I have as comfort is he's no longer in pain, and that I was soo lucky to have him.  Over the week I've cried so many tears, but also smiledo at all the times he did something silly. Like when he Dug holes in the garden so that he could lay in them when the sun came out, or how he would take the squeak out of all his toys, or chew the tops off of plastic bottles then get bored because he'd done what he was trying to do.  Typing that is making me smile right now, because he brought me so much happiness that I'm sure your pooch brought you. Hopefully you won't have to go through that just yet, and he'll pull through just fine.  What are some happy memories he's given you?"

And it matters not how old we are.  Love is ageless.  You were blessed to have each other and that is the only important thing.  You had each other then and now and forever and always because that is love.  Always and forever.  Keeping you both in my thoughts and heart.

I haven't even eaten since she died last night.  The best thing I've found to do so far is just to read other people's stories of their pets and losses.  I just had to realize that no matter what goes through my head; memories, guilt, anything, it's not going to reverse it.  Just be glad you gave them a good life."

Petloss,2ypt2k,a_tad_mental,2,Thu Mar 12 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"You gave him a life he wouldn't otherwise would have had, you were lucky to find one another.  Also some brain tumors can cause increased aggression/abnormal behavior in pets.  But it does seem like it's possible he forgot his training and returned to his old ways."
Petloss,2ypt2k,ziddersroofurry,2,Thu Mar 12 02:54:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going to join the chorus of folks telling you not to blame yourself. You did all you could and gave them so many years of love and happiness. They weren't themselves at the end and rather than have their last years be full of stressful encounters or (potentially) encounters where they might have been forcibly taken from you, you let them keep their dignity.   The wounds will heal and eventually you'll be able to cherish them in a more positive way. I suggest giving yourself some time and then perhaps helping another lost soul find their way to a good home. The world needs kind hearts like yours."

Petloss,2yoa25,53r4c,2,Thu Mar 12 03:25:46 2015 UTC,Thank you for your kind words. He did in fact live a full life. He was a world traveler ( he lived on 2 continents and in 3 countries and visited about 8 more countries).  And he never lacked for food and cuddles.  I miss him deeply but it is getting easier day by day. I am at the point now where most of my tears are because I remember how fuzzy his hugs were instead of devastation at his loss.

Petloss,2ympek,Geicanfan,5,Wed Mar 11 01:40:44 2015 UTC,"The truth.  Passing away in their sleep is not a bad way to go.  I'm sure she realized the  advanced age and the possibility existed.  If she wanted to know why you didn't interrupt her vacation just say you didn't want to unnecessarily worry her since there was nothing that could have been done.  It's hard when they have to go, but nature always comes calling.  If you have time maybe make her a collage of pictures and put it in a frame.  After I had to put mine down my friend gave me one that had the saying ""just whisper my name in your heart, I will be there"".  There's lots of pet memorial sayings you can google.  It might ease the pain."
Petloss,2ylpyq,Kanion,6,Tue Mar 10 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel OP. My dog who I've had since she was born (I remember holding her in the palm of my hand). She was hit by a car about 3 weeks ago. 4 years old.  I went through what you're going through (and I still am). My sadness turns to rage and I just want her back here with me. She was supposed to die of old age. She was supposed to be there when I find the love of my life. I always thought if she gave instant approval of someone that would be a good sign!   It's a terrible thing to go through, especially when you feel it was preventable. Hang in there."
Petloss,2ylpyq,tdatran,2,Tue Mar 10 23:14:14 2015 UTC,I'm sorry for your lost too. I'm either sobbing or raging or beating myself up cause I feel like I failed him. I got some amazing friends though helping me through. This is the worst day in my life so far.
Petloss,2ylpyq,Geicanfan,3,Tue Mar 10 23:31:57 2015 UTC,I know exactly how you feel. I experienced something similar with one of my cats a few years ago. I still cry over every pet loss I've had regardless of time or the way it happened. People have a difficult time understanding animal loss when they don't see animlas as family members and friends but you have my support in the way you feel. What I've learned from my experience is while our animlas love and connect with us and can commuincate with us very well their logic and view of the world can also be very different. Instinct can take over and depending on their knowledge of other animals that can change how they behave. My dog always grew up with other dogs and cats and has never been aggressive towards them but she has gone after small rodents because we never showed her those were animals you love and live with. It's the same with that dog it probably doesn't know any better and is going by what it knows. It doesn't bring your baby back but know it probably didn't have a vicious intent but more likely a protective instinct. I found that going through it over and over again and telling myself I was supposed to have more time makes it worse. While I miss my babies every day I try to think of all the happy times we had. The way they cuddled with me or gave me kisses or the funny quirks they had. It'll be hard right now because thinking about it is painful fresh but with time it's easier to have happy memories. I'm sorry for your loss.
Petloss,2ylpyq,AliceSora,2,Wed Mar 11 01:57:27 2015 UTC,It hurts a lot. I hope with time it gets better. This sucks cause he's my first furbaby I lost.
Petloss,2ylpyq,Cinere,2,Wed Mar 11 02:20:39 2015 UTC,I'm truly sorry for you and your baby. Is there animal control up there that can do something? There is the possibility that this dog is feral since no one knows who he belongs to. How many more have to die? Who knows when this dog will get a child or person next. :(   Someone needs to do something now.
Petloss,2ylpyq,TheRockLobster,2,Tue Mar 10 23:40:13 2015 UTC,We called and reported it but they are horrible at their job. My friend got bite bad on the leg by another dog and they just sent it home. They don't really care about it attacking cats. This is 6th time it's be reported.   I worry about that too. It attacks cats what is stopping it from going near a small child. My neighbourhood is full of small kids ages 1-10 years old.
Petloss,2ylpyq,aprilsangels,2,Wed Mar 11 00:01:10 2015 UTC,Sorry for your loss. The suddenness definitely doesn't help.

Petloss,2ykw74,attorneyriffic,5,Tue Mar 10 17:43:54 2015 UTC,What you did for him was very brave and very big on your part. You put him first and that was the best thing you could have done for him. My poodle of 13 years died four years ago she was fine and the vet even said she was extremely healthy for her age. Six months later she had gained alot of weight no matter what I did. One day she wasn't walking right. I made an appointment for the vet the next day and held her all night but I woke up to her gone. I apologized to her the same way wishing I could have taken care of her better. But he wouldn't want you to think that. Worse would have been that he kept suffering and living in pain. Now he doesn't have to hurt anymore. I can tell from this that you love him a lot and I'm sure he knew it while he was with you. I hope your pain eases soon. I said it in a post to someone else but time does help and so does staying busy. One day it will be easier to think more of the happier memories than this one. I'm sorry for your loss.

I had just stopped at Pizza Hut to grab lunch and it hit me like a ton of bricks.  I just remember crying my eyes out for 10-15 minutes in that parking lot before hitting the road.  I was in fourth grade when we got that dog and a 25-year old combat veteran of four deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq when they put him to sleep.  They decided not to put him to sleep or tell me until I got back, looking back--I'm glad they did it that way because I only have good memories when I said goodbye to him for the last time.  Not sure if the pain will ever go away but it gets better.  I still get choked up when I think about that day.  Best wishes."

The grieving process is no different than grieving the loss of a close human friend or family member. It will take time. Talk to friends and family who can sympathize with death of your cat.   Also use this subreddit. I subscribed to this subreddit after I had to euthanized my dog.  People who are subscribers are or have experienced the loss of a pet and know what you're going through. Give yourself time to grieve.  It will get better."

On Sunday I had to make to difficult decision to have my 15 year old kitty Sam euthanized. I knew it was time when he didn't want to eat his breakfast and when he jumped down from his favorite resting place he collapsed on the floor. Broke my heart, but at the same time I knew that what I was doing was the ultimate kindness that we can offer our pets. That we can end their suffering in a kind and humane way. It is an expression of loving kindness. I chose this time to do it at home instead of a vets office. The doctor who came to my home was probably the kindest and most sympathetic person I have ever met. Sam was comfortable and went peacefully in my arms, surrounded by his friends both human and feline knowing he is loved.   I think the most important advice that I can offer anyone is to not place any expectations on how you should feel or for how long. Do not deny your feelings. Try to show yourself the same love and kindness that you possessed for your friend. It is ok to cry. I am crying as I am typing this to you.   It is a burden we must bear as guardians to our furry friends that we must outlive them and the price we pay for their unconditional love is that we must send them off on their final journey with the same love they gave to us.   Peace and love to you."

Getting another dog too quickly may lead to you projecting the things you really missed about your late pet on to the new one, which may lead to some weird emotional feedback. The dog would probably adapt to another animal if it is typically pretty good with other pets. If he/she is visually impaired, would a puppy be too much action for him/her?  I'd give it at least a month to get your proper grieving in. It's called a process for a reason. It takes time."

I just image searched ""pet memorial garden"" and several nice gardens came up.  Also searching some home and garden show pages and pet cemetery pages (bubbling wells in CA has done photos).  EDIT:  I cremated my pets because I'm still moving around and I want to take them with me.   Maybe once I settle in a place I'll bury their ashes, but most likely I'll carry them around and have them buried with me.  Sometimes I think I should spread them at a place they enjoyed, but I think they most enjoyed just being around me.  When my horse died I just had his head, heart, and hooves cremated since it was going to be $4000 for whole body cremation.  I know it's just their body, not them, but it brings me comfort knowing I still have a piece of them."

He could still eat and move around but seemed to be uncomfortable going about his day. Had a recent scare where he wouldn't stop vomitting due to a GI tract infection, though that cleared up with antibiotics. Tried to spend as much time with him as possible today and even managed to make him some chicken noodle soup so he wouldn't go hungry. Family decided we'd let him go while he still had strength of body and dignity intact. It's an agonizing decision but I really do have to agree with Mafiachickens that it's better to let them go earlier than to wait until it's too late.

Petloss,2y8543,gizm0mar,2,Sat Mar 7 19:41:48 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry for your loss.  If it helps any the most common cause of unexpected death in cats > 2yrs old is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart).  Unfortunately 99% of the time it is diagnosed after death.  There's no real treatment either.  Just a really unfortunate part of nature.  There's really no suffering because death is quick.  My thoughts are with you as you grieve and find that new normal.
Petloss,2y8543,a_tad_mental,2,Sat Mar 7 22:05:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the words.  From the research my sister and her friend have done, both of whom are former vet techs, that seams like the most likely answer to what happened.  I was going to take him to the vet to see if they could find an answer however I didn't really want him to have been cut up and such.  The answer provided from the vet just over the phone, yourself, and others is sufficient for me.  His heart was just too big, in every way possible."

Petloss,2y23s0,tdatran,3,Thu Mar 5 20:13:17 2015 UTC,"I'm haunted and I think this will stay with me for the rest of my life. My best friend recently passed so it's still fresh for me. I just picked up her urn today. This was the same clinic that sewed her back together about a year ago when she was attacked by a bigger dog (this dog also attacked my neighbors dog). I remember waiting at home while she was getting stitches and how happy she was to see me when I came to pick her up. She immediately jumped into my arms and I thought she might have opened up her stitches.  She was hit by a car and was only 4 years old (my dad accidentally left the garage door open when he went outside and she ran to him). That image will haunt me forever. I remember the scene vividly and I've woken up at night at images of her body. I carried her in my arms as I drove her to the vet to get cremated. I carried her into the clinic and everyone was lined up waiting for me. I handed her over with tears just flooding my face. It was just such a terrible thing to go through. I wasn't there for her last moments, which continually eats me up inside.  Life seems empty now and it's really hard to find joy in the things I do, but things are slowly getting better. I'll never stop thinking about her and I still have my dark days, but it's getting better day by day. I haven't told anyone what happened (they know my dog passed, but not the details), except for reddit.   http://imgur.com/fVGVQCI here's a photo of her.   Kira definitely knew you were beside her and that gave her a peace a mind. You made the right decision to not let her suffer. It's going to be tough and some days will be tougher than the others. It will get better, trust me."

It's at it's worst when the lights go out and my wife is at work (she works the night shift) - that's when I have too much time to think about it, and I'm up for hours.  I've been coming into work 3 hours early each day specifically because I'm not getting any sleep, and would rather try to busy myself than have time alone.    Yesterday we picked up her remains, and they were in a white plastic rectangle with her name, date of cremation, and a company logo who did the cremation.  It bothered me more than a little bit that the company would put it's logo on something that a family might display within the home, especially if they cannot afford a more detailed urn.  It was strange...I dreaded going to pick up her remains, but was numb we walked in.  I signed a little form, and they opened a cabinet under a desk and pulled out this bag.  It had her paw prints in clay and her remains, but had this very strong...I don't know, ""hospital smell"".  It made me want to vomit as soon as I opened the bag, which of course hurt that I could even have that response about my beloved daughter.  Then my wife and children started crying and we sat in the parking lot of the vet clinic in Tuscon crying.    I'm starting to find some comfort in talking about the funny things she did in life, but they're always overshadowed by the fact that she's not there.  (T-T)"

You did everything you could and in this situation, you made a decision that helped your best friend leave this world in comfort and peace. I hope you can take a bit of comfort in that. You chose to end her suffering, and even though it hurts (and will hurt for a while, I'm sorry.) you did the right thing.   To answer your questions; Yes, I am haunted by the  the thought of my horses body after she was found dead. The look of her eyes when I saw her will dominate my thoughts if I allow it. Is there a time frame for grief? Every one grieves in different ways, and every loss is different. I can just now go to the pasture with out sobbing, but with my first horse, I couldn't go feed the other horses for a month. It all depends I guess.

Petloss,2y23s0,Staygoldheisenberg,5,Fri Mar 6 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"Please don't think her last moments were terrible because they were not. She got to drift off to sleep with the person she loved most with no fear, no pain, just the comfort of you. I hope my end is as easy. We know going into these relationships that we will most likely outlive our beloved companions but this unpleasant knowledge is dwarfed by the joy both parties experience.

She was my best friend since 2000.  I was right there for her when she passed and I don't think I'll ever forget that moment.  It haunts me and brings me to tears every time I think about it.  I miss her so much.  That pain is sometimes very strong but sometimes it is completely replaced by all the wonderful memories I have of her.  Either way it makes me cry.  I know it is difficult but try and remember the best parts of your time together.  You did the right thing for her by letting her go peacefully and without you she may not have had such a happy, long life full of love.  It is tough now but it will get easier.  Pick your self up and move forward, you have a job and a responsibly to your family and I'm sure your girl wouldn't have  wanted to get in the way of that in this life or the next.

Petloss,2y23s0,jabssy,2,Mon Mar 9 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"First off, I am truly sorry for your loss.  I just had to put my ""baby"" down in November due to a brain tumor (he was 15).  Watching him take his last breaths, yes that image still brings me anxiety, but I remind myself he wasn't who he once had been and was not going to recover given his tumor.  It would only get worse from there.  He was my favorite, my cuddle buddy.  After he passed I really didn't have a favorite yet I loved all my remaining pets.  I'm still grieving over him and now both my 16 year old cat (kidney failure) and nearly 18 year old dachshund mix (nasal cancer) are declining rapidly and I'm currently deciding when to let them go.  Most likely in the next week and on the same day.  I'm also a veterinary pathologist, so I see a lot death due to disease.  There's never a ""right"" time to let them go.  We want them to stay with us forever, but nature does not allow it.  Nature always wins.  From what you mentioned, there was nothing they really could have done.  If they could, how much time and what would be the quality of life?  It was a malignant tumor (hemangiosarcoma?)  For me, and this is in regards to my personal situation, nature is doing its best to take mine away.  Anything I do to prolong their lives is for me, not them.   They don't understand what is happening to them and they live in the now (once I diagnosed my own dog with nasal cancer I opted not to treat since they don't understand what is going on and the her quality of life would be decreased, this is my own personal belief and absolutely don't judge others for their decisions).    Another thing is only you can fully understand the bond you had with Kira.  I know that her passing has left a huge hole in your heart, and honestly at least for me my pets leaving will cause that hole always be there.  But having them in my life was worth it.  Time eventually heals, but it's never the same.  It sucks, but you have to find that new normal.  I cried everyday from the time my pup was euthanized until New Year's Day.  It was the first day I didn't cry.  I still cry a little weekly, a lot more this week since my other two are doing downhill.  As long as your grief doesn't harm others, grieve how you need to grieve.  The only exception is any self harm thoughts, that I would recommend seeing a professional. Society puts pressure on us to grieve a certain way, and I'm forcing myself to get out of that.  At first I was hesitant to tell my husband I miss our pup because I didn't want him to be sad too.  I'd force myself to say it, and he would say he missed him too.  He's going to grieve harder for our cat because he has a stronger bond with her.  I understand that.    Hopefully my rambling helps.  Kira was loved, she had a great life, and you both were lucky to find one another.  ""Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, love leaves a memory no one can steal."" ~From a headstone in Ireland"

Petloss,2y0i43,AliceSora,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:48:36 2015 UTC,"I'm very sorry for your loss, Jyeli.  I had a similar situation, if you'll allow me to share...and please forgive the ramblings...I'm going for something similar right now, so I feel your pain, have been in that situation, and am in a very similar one currently.   -- wall of text below --  When I was about 5 years old, we adopted a black lab mix named Sarah.  After a few vet visits, she was diagnosed with heart murmurs, and only given two years to live.  She was my best friend, and throughout her life, I would always be there, except at the end.    When I was in the 6th grade, my parents got divorced, and both eventually moved to different states.  My father was given custody of the children and Sarah.  After graduating from high school, I joined the military and was stationed in Japan.  In 2004, I got married, adopted a puppy who looked just like Sarah (Kira, who just passed away early last Friday morning).    A few months later, after my wife and I had just suffered through our first miscarriage, my mother (whom I've had very little contact with at this point) called (to Japan) to tell me that my father had had Sarah euthanized.  Yes, that was past-tense.  It had already happened.  And my father, who I spoke to all the time, had said nothing about it to me.  I was livid, called him up, and was told that she had been diagnosed with cancer, and a few months later they had her put to sleep.  I didn't speak to my father for nearly a year after that.    I felt both that my father had betrayed me by not giving me a chance to say goodbye (because I would have taken leave and bought a ticket to fly back to say my goodbyes at the end), and that I betrayed her because I left her, my best friend.  I can only imagine how she must have felt as my sisters, in turn (we're all two years apart, me being the eldest), each grew up and moved out on their own.    It took a lot to come to terms with it.  Now I'm having to do it again, coming to terms with having to send my daughter and another best friend to the Great Pillow In The Sky again."
Petloss,2xzjby,stoneypony,3,Thu Mar 5 04:02:43 2015 UTC,i dont know how to make a post on reddit but i am with you...i just lost my 12 yr old cat max yesterday. that hits home. at least we loved them.
Petloss,2xzjby,awooble,2,Thu Mar 5 06:52:59 2015 UTC,You did do the right thing. That doesn't make it easier. I put down my cat just in January. He was 25 years old. I had had him since I was in the third grade. His name was Jack. He was so ill he couldn't make his mouth work to even drink. He had lost 3 pounds in a matter of weeks. And I still felt guilty. I still kinda do. When they injected him I couldn't imagine the pain for me would be that bad. It literally made my knees give out. But he hadn't slept in three days. And I had more time with him than anyone can ever expect to have with a cat. I miss him so much. And I know I always will. But you did the right thing. Please know that. Us choosing to euthanize them and release them from their suffering is a final gift we give them. It's something we should be able to do for people. I know you're in pain. And I know your pain. It'll ease. It just takes time. For now take some time to mourn. You deserve it.
Petloss,2xzjby,NeonBatman,2,Thu Mar 5 04:47:21 2015 UTC,"The thought of her hooked up on a bunch of IVs broke my heart...i knew she'd hate it. All she wanted to do was sleep....so i thought i should let her.    I am sobbing right now because when I had to euthanize my kitty at 6 years old due to lymphoma 3 weeks ago, this exact thought is why I went through with it. I felt and still feel exactly as you do, doubting myself and wondering if I didn't try hard enough. But all he wanted to do was sleep, and nothing was making him feel any better.   They just wanted to go to sleep, and we let them do just that with as little pain and as much dignity as we could give them. I just didn't know it would hurt this much for this long."

Something a lot like this happened to me Monday, although no one in the household realized that we were going to lose Arioch when we took him in to the vet. So I didn't go, I was expecting them to get him treated/bring him home. They called me from the vet to tell me it was cancer. At least he had 2 out of 3 of his humans there."
Petloss,2xviv7,MZago1,9,Wed Mar 4 04:58:05 2015 UTC,"That's so horrible. Are you and your wife still in full contact with MIL? If so, I'd suggest at least spending a period of time going no contact or less contact, at least until your wife has recovered a little from this. I can't even comprehend someone doing that to their own daughter. That MIL is clearly only a mother in the legal sense. I understand that you may be confused and angry, but at this point in time, it might be a good idea to focus on your wife's emotional healing from all of this. She's obviously very distraught and will need your shoulder to cry on. Since you're on r/petloss, I guess I don't have to tell you about not marginalizing the grieving process for pets. It's a good sign that you're posting about it, because that means that you care.   I've never had anything like that happen to me before, but I'd be willing to talk to you or her if you need or want advice from some random Texas college student. Good luck and I hope that your wife is able to find peace eventually."

You hit the nail on the head, she's my wife's mother but has never acted like a mom. And I am of course focusing on my wife's healing. The second the call was done she was in my arms.  This was a first for her. I've unfortunately seen three pets go: one had to be put to sleep, one got hit by a car, one had leukemia and epilepsy, so this isn't the first time around for me. I've always considered my pets a part of the family, so they should be grieved and honored just like humans, as such I made sure my wife still has plenty of room in her heart for the dog we have right now.  And thank you too. The fact that you took the time to respond shows you also care about some random stranger on the internet."
Petloss,2xviv7,Lithiarch,3,Wed Mar 4 12:52:40 2015 UTC,"You are doing the right thing. It is hard and she will probably have pangs of sadness (very sharp at first and then fading into melancholy or wistfulness in the future) and the best thing you can really do in those times is to support her and be there for her. I have full confidence that you will be a great husband and she will be thankful to have someone who cares as much as you do for her. Good luck, buddy. Anytime people post here, it's always sad, but this instance especially is heartbreaking."
Petloss,2xviv7,erdmanatee,2,Wed Mar 4 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"What /u/moonbleu said, friend. I really hope you and your family brave through this time, and I hope you guys come out stronger.  As for that in-law you mention: that really is some shitty show of character right there."
Petloss,2xviv7,moonbleu,2,Sun Mar 8 17:08:32 2015 UTC,"The next few weeks will be really hard. I'm very sorry for you.   My SO went through a lot when I lost my cat (cat didn't come home one night, over 2 yrs ago).   It was really hard for me to heal and it took a very long time. I am so thankful that my SO was there to help me move on. He even pushed me to visit a shelter some months later to look at some cats, and we ended up taking one home.   Make sure you let yourself have some time to breathe outside of this. Spending a great deal of time around someone grieving can be very emotionally draining and while she needs you, you also need time to recharge."
Petloss,2xu81y,CoffeeFingers,6,Tue Mar 3 22:34:24 2015 UTC,"Get a carbon monoxide test for your home stat - this is unfortunately how my aunt found out she had a leak in her house.    Also, so sorry for your loss."
Petloss,2xu81y,Threnners,2,Wed Mar 4 02:23:30 2015 UTC,How heartbreaking for you.  I am so very very sorry for your loss of your dear Zoey and Baka.  Keeping you in my heart.  RIP Zoey  RIP Baka
Petloss,2xu81y,tinyirishgirl,2,Wed Mar 4 01:04:10 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry about your birds; they are such lovely little creatures. The carbon monoxide test is good advice, and it may help keep you and your family safe."
Petloss,2xu81y,IllManTheFlashlight,2,Wed Mar 4 03:37:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the condolences, venting here has helped a bit I think.  We have a freshly installed (< 2 months) and working smoke/carbon monoxide detector, though the thought did cross my mind."
Petloss,2xty8x,tunnels12000,5,Tue Mar 3 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"My dog cocoa died almost 1 year ago and I recently adopted again. My biggest problem with adopting again was the fact that I had cocoa since she was a pup and what dog could live up to the high pedestal that I put her on? She was with me through the bad and the good and helped me when I was first diagnosed with depression.   What I noticed though as the months passed after her death that I was crying less and remembering her more when she was alive and less haunted after being with her when she died.  I thought that no dog could ever replace her. But I wasn't replacing her, I was building a new pedestal for the next part of my life, with Ernest.   If you can provide a loving home for a dog then any dog would be lucky to be your companion."
Petloss,2xty8x,howistheskyblue,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:53:30 2015 UTC,You are a beautiful spirit and a truly loving heart.
Petloss,2xty8x,tinyirishgirl,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this was really beautiful and helpful for me. No dog can ever replace Elliot, she was by my side as I grew into an adult. A new dog can have a different experience with me that will be equally as valuable but not the same."
Petloss,2xty8x,SsurebreC,3,Sat Mar 7 04:54:05 2015 UTC,"I lost my yellow lab almost three years ago (old age). He wasn't just my first dog but my first pet ever. I was completely disabled for the first two days - I couldn't even go to work.  I missed him everytime I opened the door and was expecting him to greet me. I couldn't take the pain of getting another dog only to have the same thing happen again... eventually.  It took me over a year to want a new dog. Same breed, of course. I was worried that he'd really be the same thing, that I'm not replacing my dog but wanting a clone. But my puppy quickly proved me wrong. He has his own personality and he looks different - you can tell the subtle things.  I will say that I sometimes look into his eyes and think about my other dog but for the most part, it's definitely a different dog and you will form a brand new relationship with him. I've had my puppy for over a year now and I have no regrets. Although I waited a lot more than you are, I felt like I needed that time, so go at your own pace. When you're ready, it will be worth it again."
Petloss,2xty8x,SsurebreC,2,Wed Mar 4 20:25:19 2015 UTC,"I think some of the pain is an absence of routine, for me. I miss Elliot so much and am so constantly reminded of her death when I come home, lay in bed, leave in the morning etc.   I am getting to the point where I can look at pictures of her and smile instead of cry. I would voluntarily feel this pain forever to have had her in my life for the seven years that I did- her life was so beautiful and brought me so much joy. Making her happy made me happy and I have not had such a pure and loving relationship with any living thing before she came into my life.   For this reason, I know that getting another dog would be a positive addition to my life. I appreciate you sharing your story, your dog is lucky to have you."
Petloss,2xty8x,Kellianne,1 point,Sat Mar 7 05:03:01 2015 UTC,"Looks like yours was lucky to have you too. It took me a while to manage after and yes, the lack of routine killed me. The worst is whe I came home, I knew his butt was to the door so I always felt that subtle bump. The lack of bump and a tip of the nose around the corner was awful for months.  Take your time and good luck but I would highly recommend getting a new dog - don't let this tragedy stop you from having a great time with another dog. If anything, do it for the other dog who will worship you forever."
Petloss,2xru39,R34vspec,1 point,Tue Mar 3 09:52:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your loss. Find comfort in the fact that he fell asleep in your arms, the place he found comfort and love for the past 17 years.

Petloss,2xru39,gizm0mar,1 point,Tue Mar 3 13:14:30 2015 UTC,I lost my dog this morning. It was so sudden. I'm trying to stay strong. Both of our pets are in a better place now. Probably sniffing each other as I type this.

Petloss,2xr1xg,Merkoa,2,Thu Mar 5 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"Stay strong.  Think about all the good times you had together.  Remember that nothing is permanent, your pain will subside.  Cherish your other pets while they are here.  My dog will be 15 this year.  I'm dreading her leaving too.  She still seems pretty strong so hopefully she sticks around for a couple more years.  Gonna suck when she leaves.  Order a pizza.  That usually helps me when I'm sad."
Petloss,2xqeqv,Rorplup,6,Tue Mar 3 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"You stepped up and did a good thing today, Rorplup. Mr Cat was very sick and you let his pain go. Hugs."

And don't worry about not having done him justice. Because tummy rubs and ear-scratches, and a lifetime of food, shelter, love and getting to laugh at his humans doing silly things? That is heaven right there."

Just needed someones opinion, I'm a little bit stressed out because I will get my cat ashes tomorrow and I don't want to open the box with the ashes too often because I want him to have piece, so I will just open it once and put the ashes in the urn and the necklace, hope it look good when it arrive :-)"
Petloss,2xm9dz,Rahallahan,1 point,Mon Mar 2 10:55:58 2015 UTC,"Call the crematorium. Some of them will seal the box, so it can't be opened, ask them if they plan on doing this with your buddy's urn. If they do, ask they can reserve some in a small bag for you to put into the necklace."
Petloss,2xm9dz,Rahallahan,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:31:27 2015 UTC,"That is a beautiful urn! I just put my boy down a few days ago and I tried to find an urn that had a cat on top that looked like him, but I just couldn't find one.  So he got a gorgeous marble urn.  And to answer your question, you do what you need to do! Don't let others make you feel bad about any decisions you make regarding your best friend!

He is the part of me that can reach out into the sea. He has told me a thousand times over that I am his reason for being; by the way he rests against my leg; by the way he thumps his tail at my smallest smile; by the way he shows his hurt when I leave without taking him. (I think it makes him sick with worry when he is not along to care for me.) When I am wrong, he is delighted to forgive. When I am angry, he clowns to make me smile. When I am happy, he is joy unbounded. When I am a fool, he ignores it. When I succeed, he brags. Without him, I am only another man. With him, I am all-powerful. He is loyalty itself. He has taught me the meaning of devotion. With him, I know a secret comfort and a private peace. He has brought me understanding where before I was ignorant. His head on my knee can heal my human hurts. His presence by my side is protection against my fears of dark and unknown things. He has promised to wait for me... whenever... wherever - in case I need him. And I expect I will - as I always have. He is just my dog."" (Gene Hill) I'm so sorry for your loss."

Petloss,2xab1d,wengerwarrior,2,Thu Feb 26 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"I'm browsing this subreddit because I lost my 5 year old cat,  Bear,  to a very aggressive blood cancer less than a week ago. However,  our post really hit home for me because I also lost my childhood love dog,  Stella,  November of 2013. Her death was extremely tragic and unexpected,  it was a neurological condition.  The day I was supposed to go see her) she lived with my mom an hour away)  I bailed because I was tired and didn't feel good.  By the next day,  she had slipped into a coma and I was never able to see her as her normal self again,  as we had to put her down the next day.  The guilt over my decision still haunts me.  Remember,  though,  that they don't think like we do.  Buddy knew will everything he had that you loved him.  I am a firm believer that pets are beyond the need for physical presence- they are always with you.  I still feel Stella and Bear's presence in my life.  Although they,  along with Buddy,  have gone on,  the way the made us feel,  and the essence of what they are that made us love them,  is still here.  My grief and guilt over Stella's passing,  and my indignation at the way Bear was taken from us,  is nothing,  nothing in the face of how much I loved them.  I am sure that you feel the same for Buddy,  and he knows it.  Your pictures of him are so sweet,  and he seems like such a happy old guy.  I think your mom made the right decision,  and let him go with his happiness and dignity still intact.  If it brings you any sort of closure or solace,  I used to be a vet tech,  and I notice his hair loss pattern and his little ""bubble butt""  are quite characteristic of Cushings disease.  Perhaps he had it,  perhaps not,  but if he did,  he went before any symptoms of that disease could manifest,  and perhaps that is a blessing.  There is nothing wrong with continuing to grieve and honor his memory.  As Henry Scott Holland says in his poem,  death is nothing at all.  He has only slipped into the next room.  Whatever you were to each other,  that,  you still are.                       I am truly sorry for your loss."

So so full of love and feist. He was sort of acting weird and breathed really heavily yesterday. I was at work the whole time my roommate was at the vet and then she told me and I was just in shock. I thought maybe he had asthma or something. It hurts.

Petloss,2wwmp4,kb5prz,2,Mon Feb 23 20:09:12 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry for the loss of your Samantha. She was a beauty. I can tell she was loved very much. My heart goes out to you and your wife.
Petloss,2wwmp4,OCDiane,3,Mon Feb 23 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this comment.  We are smothered in grief.  With no cat family remaining, our home is a difficult place to find solace.  Every crack and pop of the structure sounds like our Samantha walking on the wood floors.  It seems her ghost was born yesterday, and we are hearing noises we never heard before.  We are not spiritual people, but today is the first time I wished for the existence of a heaven where people and animals can enjoy the afterlife."
Petloss,2wwmp4,OCDiane,2,Tue Feb 24 13:10:41 2015 UTC,"I completely understand your grief. I sometimes think I see my Molly out of the corner of my eye. I woke up one morning to hearing her meow, only to realize it was a dream. I hope the noises you're hearing are in someway, comforting to you and your wife."
Petloss,2wvkwm,Husonaut,3,Mon Feb 23 15:20:24 2015 UTC,"I am feeling pain from my cat's renal failure decline and death as well.  We worked hard to maintain her quality of life to the end.  I have often wondered if the pain is worth it... and then I remember how much joy my cat gave me, and how much of a better human I became because of her.  Those gifts are priceless, and I can see now how my deep grief is a way of imprinting a positive change on my whole being.  Nothing is fair... nobody gets out alive... things are fleeting and impermanent.  Don't let the pathos of this reality get you down!  Feel the pain now, but let the memories warm you later."
Petloss,2wvkwm,kb5prz,3,Mon Feb 23 20:14:56 2015 UTC,I feel your pain as well as renal failure took away my 15 years old princess... many hugs xxx

Petloss,2wv39x,ihartcandii,6,Mon Feb 23 11:53:36 2015 UTC,"I am your dog, and I have a little something I’d like to whisper in your ear.  I know that you humans lead busy lives. Some have to work, some have children to raise. It always seems like you are running here and there, often much too fast, often never noticing the truly grand things in life.  Look down at me now, while you sit there at your computer. See the way my dark brown eyes look at yours? They are slightly cloudy now. That comes with age. The gray hairs are beginning to ring my soft muzzle. You smile at me; I see love in your eyes. What do you see in mine? Do you see a spirit? A soul inside, who loves you as no other could in the world? A spirit that would forgive all trespasses of prior wrong doing for just a simple moment of your time? That is all I ask. To slow down, if even for a few minutes to be with me.   So many times you have been saddened by the words you read on that screen, of other of my kind, passing. Sometimes we die young and oh so quickly, sometimes so suddenly it wrenches your heart out of your throat. Sometimes, we age so slowly before your eyes that you may not even seem to know until the very end, when we look at you with grizzled muzzles and cataract clouded eyes. Still the love is always there, even when we must take that long sleep, to run free in a distant land. I may not be here tomorrow; I may not be here next week. Someday you will shed the water from your eyes, that humans have when deep grief fills their souls, and you will be angry at yourself that you did not have just “One more day” with me.  Because I love you so, your sorrow touches my spirit and grieves me. We have NOW, together. So come, sit down here next to me on the floor, and look deep into my eyes. What do you see? If you look hard and deep enough we will talk, you and I, heart to heart. Come to me not as “alpha” or as “trainer” or even “Mom or Dad,” come to me as a living soul and stroke my fur and let us look deep into one another’s eyes, and talk. I may tell you something about the fun of chasing a tennis ball, or I may tell you something profound about myself, or even life in general.  You decided to have me in your life because you wanted a soul to share such things with, someone very different from you. And, here I am. I am a dog, but I am alive. I feel emotion, I feel physical senses, and I can revel in the differences of our spirits and souls. I do not think of you as a “Dog on two feet” — I know what you are. You are human, in all your quirkiness, and I love you still.  Now, come sit with me, on the floor. Enter my world, and let time slow down if only for 15 minutes. Look deep into my eyes, and whisper to my ears. Speak with your heart, with your joy and I will know your true self. We may not have tomorrow, and life is oh so very short.  Love, Your Dog"

I look every night at the spot my boy Duke always laid in. My living room feels so much emptier now that he isn't there anymore.   I've thought about getting another dog (I have his brother Boomer with me still) but I just don't I will ever be able to get another yellow lab.   Not a bad owner friend, a bad owner would not feel this emotion. A bad owner would say ""its just a dog"" and move on with life, not write a beautiful note to his boy.  Just like I did everynight, I still say goodnight to my boy, because I know he is still there with me. I still talk to his ashes, I know, like my other relatives who have passed, that in some way, they can still hear me."
Petloss,2wuufw,TauV2,2,Mon Feb 23 09:25:06 2015 UTC,Your princess is in your loving heart for always and forever.  And you will be in her heart for all time until you meet again.  Holding you both in my thoughts.

Petloss,2wqlbv,frawgballs,2,Sun Feb 22 06:53:10 2015 UTC,Thank you. How did you cope? It just seems so hard. She would be right next to me right now waiting for me to go to bed...
Petloss,2wqlbv,frawgballs,2,Sun Feb 22 07:01:26 2015 UTC,"about a week later (give or take) i was across town and happened upon an old friend. he had 3 puppies (pits) and was trying to teach them to pick on the runt. i gave him 500 bucks to let me have them. i kept all 3 for 6 months until i had them pretty well trained(not easy in a small duplex) once i was sure they were gonna be ok around kids i adopted 2 of them out to friends and kept the runt, spanky as my own. he was one of the best dogs i ever had. he was with me for over 3 years until i moved and someone stole him from me. it was an inside job and i lost a couple of friends over that. karma is a bitch though cause last time i checked in both of them were junked out; broke and miserable. i had to bury one of my moms shephards 6 months ago in the back yard. i have never seen a big ol marine cry like the day her hubby asked me to help him dig that hole. a week later she got another to replace him and it just seems that getting another helped her too."

It sounds like you gave Amy a wonderful second chance at life, and I am sure she is forever grateful for that. Just hold on to all the joy and memories she gave you, and you will get through this. :)"
Petloss,2woqkd,Crazyturn,8,Sat Feb 21 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. I know what you're going through. There are certain rooms I still can't seem to go into without crying. I know what you mean about your just wanting him back. I woke up last night with the realization that mine wasn't coming back. I constantly cry, too. Some days are better than others.  Maybe start small. Sit in your car, if only for a half a minute. Try again in a few hours. Just a little at a time.  Your pup was lucky to have you. I'm sure he knew how much you loved him. I pray that the emptiness you're feeling will pass and will be filled with happy memories of your friend."
Petloss,2woqkd,OCDiane,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. I hope he did know how much I loved him, i tried to show him as much as I could.  I will try with the car, I need to get on with that anyway as soon my boyfriend will be back at work and I will have to drive it.   I'm so sorry for your loss too. It's the worst feeling in the world."

Petloss,2wkg9w,littlewolfen,2,Fri Feb 20 19:07:08 2015 UTC,So sorry for your loss.  Her brother will notice she's not around and he'll go looking.

He was my son, my boy, I never had children. I still cry every day. My wife is fed up with it. I think I am now fed up with her. I am seriously considering a divorce after 16 years. Nothing feels the same anymore, everything seems flat, or hollow. I don't think I love her anymore. We bough a home a year ago, I don't want to live in it anymore, it doesn't feel like mine."

Petloss,2wevtg,gizm0mar,2,Thu Feb 19 12:30:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your loss.. It always pains my heart when I read stories like yours.. It is never a good moment to part ways with the ones you love, but it is even harder when it is so sudden as with your dog. All you can do is love your other pets even more and keep her memory alive. For what its worth, I know what your going through and it'll hurt for quite some time. If it helps you, you can read my posts about losing my cat :)! Hang in there, not only for yourself but also for your wife and the remaining rascals :)!"
Petloss,2wevtg,RunYouCleverBoy89,2,Thu Feb 19 16:01:20 2015 UTC,"I lost my first dog, Harley (she was a miniature schnauzer and she was only nine years old), two years ago (I was also 24 - I'm turning 26 in two days, this Saturday the 21st) and I never realized how much the passing of her really was devastating me.  I was already dealing with depression and this loss was really painful.  I knew I needed to talk to someone outside of my husband, my family, and friends so I wanted to try to talk to someone in therapy.  It did help every session I went.  So maybe try therapy in your own time when you're ready.  I'm sorry for your loss, and I truly understand. Sending positive light & love your way with your family."
Petloss,2wevtg,eliz1bef,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"We also don't have kids, so we view our pets as our children, like you and your wife.  We just had to put our elderly dog down this morning, and while it was very hard, I think losing a pet suddenly is worse. I miss our Amy very much, but it was clearly her time to go.  We had time to get used to the idea. Even though it hurts us, we were prepared and expectant.  What happened to you, is especially painful.  It may be hard to accept right now, but you did everything you could for your dog. She knew it and gave all of her love to you. Good luck to you, your wife and your pets."

Petloss,2w9dyy,Stormy-0,3,Wed Feb 18 07:08:23 2015 UTC,"He is a great looking dog!  I lost my childhood dog on Sunday at the age of 14 years. The first day was nearly unbearable. I thought I would not make it past such heart ache. Today, after a few days, my heart still aches but I feel a slight sense of comfort knowing that she is no longer in any pain. (She too had lost mobility in her back legs).  Take time to remember the good times with Tylo and know that he will forever be with you in your heart."
Petloss,2w9dyy,VivereInSomnis,3,Wed Feb 18 18:41:56 2015 UTC,I understand the pain and suffering of losing a friend. My Pomeranian Isabella is on her last days refusing to eat. It just gets you knowing there is nothing you can do. That is life I suppose. As long as you have love he will never truly be gone.
Petloss,2w94w8,HoundBerry,3,Wed Feb 18 00:03:50 2015 UTC,That's the part that got me to. One day they can take a 6 mile hike with you and the next it's like they can't even get off the ground without considerable effort.  My heart goes out to you in your time of loss.
Petloss,2w94w8,Spiralyst,2,Wed Feb 18 02:12:34 2015 UTC,He's beautiful and I have no doubt he's in a better place. I'm so sorry for your loss. Most times the best thing you can do to feel better is to adopt another friend. Not to replace him but to give the love you gave to him to another dog that might not have a chance without you. If you ever feel down and want to talk about it just send me a message and I'll be there to listen.
Petloss,2w94w8,AngelicBread,2,Wed Feb 18 06:33:13 2015 UTC,"here's to lucky.   and cheers to your life with him, im sure you made him really happy.  he looked like a good boy."

Petloss,2w4qs6,dfn85,1 point,Mon Feb 16 23:28:42 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. This really sucks. Did she shed? Is there any of her fur left around your home? You can take some of that and save it or even have it put into jewelry or paperweights and such or you can keep one of her toys or collars, etc. to help you remember her by. Or you can use your photos to make one of those shutterfly/snapfish/etc. books to memorialize her. I've done this with my cat that passed and it was sad to look at, but did help me remember all the good times. Look up info about pet loss support, which can either be near you or online. I wish I could help more. I'm very sorry for your loss! :("
Petloss,2w4qs6,WaffleRun,2,Tue Feb 17 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"Corgis shed like crazy.  But we have another.  And an Aussie.  And a Border Collie.  So it would be tough to determine which one created any fluff I might find laying around.  She was buried in her collar, but I did grab her favorite toy.  I slept with it last night, and I swear a part of it still smells like her.  When it all hurts less, I'm going to make a painting of her.  It's something I usually do for friends and family who lose pets.  But I guess it's my turn."
Petloss,2w4qs6,WaffleRun,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:23:36 2015 UTC,"Ah yes. I can see why that would be tough. Painting does sound like a beautiful way to memorialize her when you're in less pain. If reading helps you, I recommend ""The Pet Loss Companion"" and ""Coping with sorrow on the loss of your pet"" both very helpful. Again, so sorry you're going through this."
Petloss,2w4vvw,Kainiaa,2,Tue Feb 17 00:08:27 2015 UTC,"I just lost my only dog about a week ago, I was and still am completely heartbroken. We got him as a puppy when I was 8, I'm 21 now. I grew up with him and I really don't remember what it was like without him. For the first few days  I just felt like a shell, I missed him so much. It won't be easy but I promise it'll get better. Just remember that you gave her a great home and that she felt loved her whole life. Stay strong, friend."
Petloss,2w4vvw,AHNOLDDD,2,Tue Feb 17 22:30:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Today I managed to spend around family and kept my mind off of it mostly or at least put on a front.  It wasn't until I was alone that it all came rushing back.  It's been so hard to walk into the living room and not immediately look for her and call her name.  I had trouble driving my car because it's what I drove her home in to be buried.  Unfortunately it's not my first rodeo with the death of a loved one.  I know it gets better eventually and I will learn to get by each day without breaking down.  Eventually I'll be able to look in the backyard and not cry, wishing she was running around on her leash instead of being buried there.  The worst feeling is the one where I feel like I let her down.  Like I was supposed to swoop in and cure the cancer and make everything better and I failed.  I'll move past it but it hurts so much.

Petloss,2w3qmb,Nakanaiide,2,Mon Feb 16 19:00:09 2015 UTC,You have nothing to be sorry about.  Maybe when we have so much love in our hearts it helps the most by sharing that love with someone who needs to be loved.  Holding you and your whole family close.
Petloss,2w3qmb,tinyirishgirl,2,Tue Feb 17 02:38:43 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your kind words.
Petloss,2w3qmb,housefrau,2,Wed Feb 18 05:56:26 2015 UTC,I have been wondering the exact same thing. We lost our dog a couple of weeks ago and miss her terribly but I have already been thinking about adopting another then worrying that it is too soon.  Left to my own devices I would have already adopted another but my SO thinks it is too soon still.
Petloss,2w3qmb,Keica,1 point,Tue Feb 17 08:07:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, I am so sorry for your loss. Thoughts and hugs to you and your family.  To answer your post, I don't think there is a ""right"" answer to this question. Only you know when is the right time.   When I was a kid we lost my first dog when he was only a couple of months old, and my mother adopted another dog a few weeks later.  We had her for nearly 15 years. A couple of weeks after she passed away I went with my family to look at some dogs. I felt terrible driving home, and I knew that I just wasn't ready.  Fast forward a couple of months and my house was starting to feel empty, I missed being greeted by a wagging tail. We went to see a different litter of puppies and I fell in love with a 3 week old puppy who has been my faithful companion for nearly 5 years now.  Short version: I waited about 4 months.  The only person who is going to know when you are ready is you. I wouldn't worry so much about how long you wait as why you're adopting. Do what feels right for you & the potential new new four legged friend in your life.  Is your brother old enough to discuss the situation with you and to let you know how he's feeling about the whole situation?"
Petloss,2w3qmb,talonspiritcat,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:40:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your kind response.  He's 13, maybe not so little anymore, haha. He's the kind of person who keeps to himself and doesn't like to talk about his feelings, especially right now because I'm sure he still feels extremely guilty about what happened. He blames himself for opening the front door and letting her slip by him, and because he was chasing her down, he saw her get hit by the car only inches away from him. As much as as we try to tell him that it's not his fault, that no one blames him at all for what happened, that there were many factors that led up to what happened that day, that no one could have predicted this outcome, I'm sure he still feels responsible.   I think adopting a dog impacted him the most. Before, he only really had negative experiences with dogs and was a bit afraid of them, bur he was finally able to open his heart up to our baby. Recently I had even noticed that she would snuggle up on the couch with him more frequently than with me, a huge step in the right direction, and that made this even more painful.  She was our first and only pet; without her, the house feels extremely empty in every aspect. Just living here is very taxing on everyone.  We've brought up the topic of adopting another and he didn't seem to shy away from the idea, he's even helped us look. He's made it clear that he doesn't want to adopt anyone who looks too similar to our first baby, and I agree. Although nothing has been set in stone yet, I think even just the idea of adopting again is helping us all move on and giving us something to look forward to."
Petloss,2w298n,Moggehh,2,Mon Feb 16 09:35:22 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my sweet little girl who I'd had for 13 years over a year ago and I'm still not ready for another cat. Time is the only thing that helps dull the pain, and while the hurt will always be there, someday you'll be able to think of the good times you had with your wonderful little kitty without feeling so much heartache. And, if it helps, I had friends in a similar situation who lost one of their two cats and felt a lot of resentment toward the one who lived -- now that more time has gone by, they can't imagine their lives without her and she is now their little princess.  Crying helps a lot too. internet hugs"

Grow older and when you have your own place get 5 dogs. It won't be replacement love for who you've lost, but it'll be new love.  I grew up with my first dog, and losing her was devastating.  10 years down the road, we have another dog.  She's completely different and we love her just as much.  Life is full of love and unborn puppies waiting for someone to share it with."

I felt and still do feel horrible after losing him but I've acknowledged that God gave me the chance to experience the joy he gave me. I felt bitter and numb for weeks but I let the pain I felt guide a new passion of mine which is caring for animals in shelters and volunteering. My baby dogs passing meant something, I was able to channel that pain into something beautiful. It still hurts more than anything but I just have to hope and pray that I'll see him again some day.  If you ever want to talk send me a pm and I'll be there to listen and talk with you. I know how sad you feel but you have to stay strong."

Petloss,2vszlx,runlizzyrun,7,Fri Feb 13 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"I am so, so sorry. This broke my heart and made me cry for you and for Rocky. Cats are experts at hiding what is really wrong and it makes it so hard on us mere humans.   I lost one of my cats just about a year ago to kidney failure. I felt the same, I should have known, the VET should have known TOLD me at least 2 years earlier based on her lab work. She crashed so suddenly and I had NO IDEA she had KD. I subjected her to unnecessary stress and procedures, when it should have been obvious that it was her time. I didn't want to take her back there for her final moments because she had grown to hate that vet over the course of the week. I am still beating myself up about how horrible her last week must have been.   But reading this subreddit has made me realize that guilt is part of the grieving process and part of loving our pets so much. We will all wonder did we do enough or do too much; did we wait too long or not give them that slight chance of recovery.   I still haven't forgiven myself, but I don't think about it every day anymore and hopefully, time will help you too.  For people who are wired like us, I don't think we can ever completely forgive ourselves, so I won't tell you that. But maybe, maybe you can take comfort that he knew you loved him and would never purposely put him in a bad situation. And I do believe that animals must have a defense mechanism that spares them from any intolerable level of pain.   EDIT: I wasn't done! Again, I am so sorry and I hope that time will heal some of your pain. Try to focus on what you learned, maybe it was an important lesson that we were being taught. Hugs."
Petloss,2vszlx,too_old_for_this_,1 point,Fri Feb 13 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your reply, knowing that other people have felt this way makes me feel so much less alone in this. I'm so sorry about your cat, kidney failure is so insidious and I remember when I worked in the vets office, how blindsiding it was for people to find out their cat was going through it. It broke my heart every time.  It still hurts so much, but I guess in time I'll feel ok. Other animals have passed away in my life, and I still think about them, but the pain isn't as bad. I just hope he's happy now, and I try to think that at least it's over, he's not still suffering.   Again, I'm so sorry for your loss, and I thank you so much for sharing your story with me. You sound like a wonderful person and I'm sure your kitty knew that too."
Petloss,2vszlx,jens_scrunchie,2,Mon Feb 16 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry.  We had to put our cat down a few weeks ago after he suffered acute kidney failure.  He was previously diagnosed w/IBD and we had been managing it fairly well for about a year and a half.  One day he really took a turn, and it was obvious that something wasn't right.    The whole time he had IBD, he was acting like himself, even when it was clear he was having a bad day.  This time, he wasn't responsive to us at all and didn't want to be petted or anything and it was frightening.    Long story short, the vet said it was hard to know whether it was acute kidney failure or just an infection without running some tests, so we did--even though he was always so terrified of the vet that he had to be sedated.  Of course, they wouldn't sedate him when he was so weak and out of it.  When he let them do a physical examination without any protest, it was terrifying.    Anyway, the point is that we kept him hospitalized for almost 3 days while they medicated him and ran tests, and, by the time we realized there was no improvement and it was definitely kidney failure, we had no choice.  When it happened, he was so angry.  He had urinated on himself and was practically feral.  It was horrible because our last moments with him was us wanting them to put him to sleep immediately.  We didn't get that last few quiet moments with him before it happened and we beat ourselves up about it for quite awhile.    So, tl;dr--I completely understand how you feel.  I wish he had been home with us and drifted off peacefully.  I wish everyone could go that way.  But, with animals, it's so hard to know when it's time or when there's a decent chance they can be saved.  If they could talk, maybe it would be less difficult.  This didn't happen the way you wanted it to, but you really did do the best you could.  You obviously loved him very much and this experience is hard enough without beating yourself up about something you can't change.  After everything happened with our cat, one of the nicest e-mails I got came from my boss.  She told me to be kind to myself.  Please, be kind to yourself.  I'm not saying you can't have regret or wish that you had done things differently.  I'm not even saying you have to necessarily forgive yourself.  But of course you never meant to hurt him and he knew you loved him.    Again, I'm really sorry and I hope you're feeling a bit better knowing that you're not alone in feeling this way."
Petloss,2vszlx,HexoftheZen,2,Sat Feb 14 04:50:45 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for what happened to you and your cat. Just reading that gave me a lump in my throat. It's so hard not being able to comfort them. You have my deepest sympathy, thank you for sharing your story with me and thank you for your kind words. It means so much to have people take the time to reach out to me."
Petloss,2vszlx,HexoftheZen,1 point,Mon Feb 16 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"Guilt is a very powerful feeling.  I carry guilt with me over not visiting a long term very good friend (a horse, but still) after we took a tumble and she got hurt.  The plan was that  I was going to give her a couple weeks to heal and before I knew it a year had gone by.  It will bring me to tears if I think for any amount of time how she may have felt I abandoned her. The empathy shared between humans and animals is a strong relationship.  It may feel insurmountable to look at your situation any other way, but to be frank, you can't dwell in it.  There is no resolution to it.  What happened, happened, and it's awful.  You feel terrible because you're a good person.  You put so much effort into thinking about how you did your pet wrong.  Continuing to think that way is going to keep it a fresh hurt.  The only upside I can see here, is that now you know what warning signs there are for future pets.  I don't mean to come across as one of those ""oh there was a plan, there is meaning"" kinds of people.  I'm pragmatic and feels are scary.  Try to focus on how much better a pet owner you are for learning how to handle that situation.  Trust your gut instinct. Remember, you are a good person. You care. That's what pets need.  Someone who cares enough to be devastated at the thought of hurting them."
Petloss,2vrthr,Guavazo,4,Fri Feb 13 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like he's suffering, and the drugs aren't that great for him. He's not that young either, so he's had a long good life with you. It's up to you, of course, but I agree it may be the right decision to have him put down. hugs"
Petloss,2vrthr,exubereft,4,Fri Feb 13 21:08:37 2015 UTC,"There's never a right time because we never want them to leave us.  It really is a tough decision to come to, I still didn't want to put my pup down when I did last November.  I was telling him ""I don't want you to go"", but I had to, he was only going to get worse.   I could have upped his prednisone, but what's next?  I'm just delaying the inevitable, and it wasn't for his sake, it was for mine.  The day I put him down was the day I had to put my selfishness aside.  He only lived to eat, breathe, and be next to me.  Me keeping him here any longer was just dragging out his pain.  This is just my story, the only true advice I can give to a stranger is to know there is never a ""right"" time & ask yourself ""is there any chance of him getting better?"""
Petloss,2vrthr,a_tad_mental,3,Fri Feb 13 23:38:32 2015 UTC,It hurts our hearts when we see our loved one struggle.

Putting ourselves in their lives makes the decision so much easier don't you think?  Hoping this helps a little.  Keeping you and your precious pup in my heart and thoughts.

Petloss,2vpug3,kamiawolf,5,Fri Feb 13 01:30:58 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel. Trust me. It's been two and a half weeks and it just feels like far too long to be without her. It hurts and it sucks and it feels like someone's ripped out your heart and you just want to scream until your throat is raw to make yourself feel pain somewhere else.   But you did something so extremely selfless, and kind, and it was the MOST loving thing you could have EVER done for her. You gave her relief, at the cost of a chunk of your heart and soul. If you believe in an afterlife, you bet she's doing nothing but thanking you and waiting for you to come back and play with her.  She is an amazingly beautiful cat, looks a little bit like my Genie.  I know it's hard, I really do. The habits you formed having her for so long, your mind seeing her in your periphery and hearing her little mewl at unexpected times. It'll get better eventually, so I'm told. I'm still waiting to stop missing her but I just doubt that will ever happen. Just let yourself mourn, grieve, and cry. <3   I am SO sorry."

She could have been a stray cat who dies in the street, sick and starved, or in a home where she is abused and neglected  or in a shelter for so long she gets euthanized at a young age.  But no.   You gave her love, fun, a home, a family, a place in this huge world where she had no worries or fears, no gazes of pity or hate as cars pass her by, no animal control seizing her from a bad home, only to be euthanized later.  You gave her the adventure of her life, and your pain only proves it was worth it all. Don't ever forget how much you gave each other, I can't be more proud and happy for the both of you, thank you for loving Shelby!  :')"

Made two appointments, and I just fall apart when it comes time to drive her over. I couldn't breath for the half hour before her first appointment.  The whole thing makes me feel like a horrible person. Paying a hitman to kill my baby. And yet, I know, I've been holding her in my arms, playing all her favorite music and singing to her (I couldn't sing my way out of a paper bag) but she just adores me, even my voice. Even through the blanket my Mum made for her, I reek of ammonia from cuddling her.   Tomorrow I have someone to help me with the final visit to the vet. I can't be like these super awesome people who talk about how they stay with their friend until the last breath, and how wonderful it was. Really thought I was was stronger than this, and I've let myself and my kitty down.   The only upside is, super sick kitty is still eating and drinking, though she can barely walk. Unrelated comment, I will NOT start smoking because of this. She's been proud of me!!!!  Wish me strength, I so need it."

I was a wreck and my heart was throbbing but no one else could hold her.   But there's no shame in being unable to do so. It hurts. Good god does it hurt so badly I wished the vet could inject me after. And not wanting to know what your baby feels like completely limp... I so badly wish I could forget that feeling. Whatever you decide to do, she will love you endlessly and she will never blame you. If you need to talk I'm here for you before and after her appointment. <3  I wish you all the strength in the world."

Petloss,2vjmx1,mjmax,2,Wed Feb 11 15:52:43 2015 UTC,"I am so so sorry for your loss. I can tell how much she meant to you. Dogs have the ability to leave such an impression that doesn't leave us when they pass. Both a blessing and a curse. If i could choose to be prepared for my best friends passing, or have it happen so unexpectedly, in a heartbeat, i would want to know. It gives you time to process what is happening, and a separate time to grieve. Your situation is somewhere in the middle by the sounds of it. You knew it was coming but were also surprised. The last time you saw her you said she looked good, and you didnt say a formal goodbye. And i would take a positive from that. Your last memory was of the dog you loved. Not a sick and tired twin. You won't have that memory to haunt you. Take your time to grieve. Write down your thoughts. Cry. Look at old pictures and tell everyone about the memories you have. Better yet, write down your favorite memories so they last forever. Write down her quirks, her nicknames, her favorite things. Just because she is gone, doesn't mean you have to forget her. Keep your chin up. Things will hurt less with time. Xo- mia"
Petloss,2vjmx1,ameliagillis,2,Thu Feb 12 02:05:44 2015 UTC,"Go home. Your family is just as sad and seeing them, although painful, will be best for all of you. I was in a similar situation in October. Talking to my parents was the only thing that made me feel better.    I saw my girl for the last time over Labor Day weekend. I took her down to the lake to play fetch, as old and tired as she was she did it with the same joy and enthusiasm (albeit much slower) she had for 15 years. While it was happening I wanted to record it or at least take a picture, knowing it may be one of last times I could capture that moment but I didn't have my phone.  My parents had to put her down a couple weeks later. I wasn't able to be with her as she passed like I had wanted to but I was so thankful she was able to spend one more weekend with me and the family.   At first I regretted not having my phone to record our last fetch but now I am glad I didn't. That memory is just for me. I can remember it exactly the way I want to, she was happy.  It was the perfect goodbye.   After the news I called in sick for work and was pretty much bedridden for days. I could barely talk to my parents about it after the fact but when I finally did it made things so much better.  Now we talk about her every time we get together.  We still cry and miss her more than anything but that burden is easier to carry together.  It was the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with in my entire life and I know I couldn't have done it without everyone else. No matter how hard it may be for you do it, go home. It will be harder for you and your family if you go it alone.   Sorry if I made that all about me. Point is I know where you are coming from, be with your family. They need you. You need them. Don't go it alone for no reason."

It helped give me those moments where I could be distracted by something else. You could visit your friend and just not say anything about her dog unless she brings it up. Just find an excuse to be there. Bring food, or not. In my situation it was enough that someone else was there.    I think the picture is a good idea but you might want to wait and see how your friend is before doing it. I don't think anyone can really tell you how your pal will react to it."

Carlos the cat and Louis the dog look like real sweeties, and it sounds like you were a great human companion for them.  In my view, Carlos and Louis are not truly gone; they will live on through you, and in turn you'll pass that on to other people you've met, and so on. Our pets impact and change our lives, and their essence in that way lives on. The unique joy and positivity and personality that Carlos and Louis emanated... I'm sure lots of that rubbed off on you and others who knew them! It seems silly, but I see you carrying them with you wherever you go, consciously and subconsciously. These guys definitely had great lives with you, and were undoubtably happy to know that you'd carry on the torch for them. Honor them well and you'll have done a wonderful job.

It sounds like he had a very good life and that's what really matters in the end.  His last photo is beautiful and reflects how calm and peaceful he was, not scared at all.    My thoughts are with you."
Petloss,2vaefl,CoolMachine,1 point,Mon Feb 9 13:59:36 2015 UTC,"How heartbreaking. I'm so sorry to see this. It's so tough, loving someone and doing everything you can--yet still saying goodbye. My sincere condolences. You are in my prayers <3"
Petloss,2vaefl,gizm0mar,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:07:18 2015 UTC,"What a terrible loss... Even on the last picture it seems that Oliver is saying that everything will be ok. And yes, an album would be great! I'll hug my cats tonight, while thinking of Oliver too! Hang in there!"
Petloss,2vaefl,dvfex,1 point,Mon Feb 9 22:24:08 2015 UTC,He was a beautiful looking cat and you're right about spending more time with them. I wish I'd spent more time being affectionate with my girl and would give everything just to do it all over again.
Petloss,2vaefl,dark_delight,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:08:36 2015 UTC,Oliver looks so majestic. Wow.  I'm very sorry for your loss. Sending positive vibes your way.

Petloss,2v844i,ThrowawayCathello,5,Sun Feb 8 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"Take pictures and videos, hopefully you can record his voice. Memories fade away faster than you'd think and it's tough to try to remember the ones we love and only have a faded memory. Best of luck to you two."
Petloss,2v844i,Dizzynha,4,Sun Feb 8 21:04:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you,  I have a wealth of pictures of him and he hasn't made a sound since he was a kitten! I used to be thankful of that, but now I really do wish I could record his voice.  I will take more though. He looks so peaceful while he is sleeping at the moment, which is of some comfort.   Thank you again."

Petloss,2v844i,wulfendy,3,Mon Feb 9 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"I regret being stingy with treats for my Tazzy [the only one of my three now-passed cats who I knew was dying and thus had extra time with]. Give your kitty all the treats he wants! Buy him some tuna or other yummy canned cat food. What other things does he like? My current girl [Cleo] loooooves potato chips, crackers, and sweet things like muffins, cake, cookies, etc.  Other than that, just cuddle and pet and maximize the time you have together. Tell him about some great memories you have of him, and let him know how important he is to you and how much you love him.  Best wishes. <3"
Petloss,2v844i,aprilsangels,2,Mon Feb 9 09:04:01 2015 UTC,I wish I didnt wait ti euthanize. It would have been nicer to have it planned for vet to come over instead of rushing him into the vet unexpectedly.
Petloss,2v844i,dvfex,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:23:54 2015 UTC,"Before my girl went I gave her as many treats as she wanted and even though she'd mostly stopped eating she gladly accepted as many as she could get.    After the fact I was going through pics of her and I realised that most of the ones I had were blurry or just bad quality. I definitely wished I'd taken as many as possible, especially towards the end. It kills me that I didn't think to take any in her last hours. As well, I wish I'd crawled into the spots she'd hidden herself in and snuggled with her as much as possible. I really wish I'd spent every waking minute I had comforting her."
Petloss,2v6htx,nashvilllethrowaway,3,Sun Feb 8 09:34:04 2015 UTC,"We're going through something similar, and we understand your pain/desperation/hopelessness/despair/hope.   It has made going home a painful affair, and we drive for hours after work and on weekends looking for him. You have done everything you can do to find him. It is not your fault he is missing, as much as you feel that way.   Little things like putting a more secure fence, putting the collar on, having him microchipped, we are going through exactly the same guilt/anger.   My wife has taken our loss harder than I have. I love my pup and I gave him everything I could to give him a happy life. Played with him, fed him good food, loved him unconditionally and he was a happy pup. I gave him the best life I could give him and he made me happy and I've done everything I can to get him back and I will continue to do so until I run out of hope.   But I do realize that his life had a finite amount left, regardless. He would be gone one day even if I had done everything perfectly, a perfect fence, an unbreakable collar, security system, etc. One day by one way or another, either by a freak accident or old age, he would leave my side.   I have come to terms that I have done everything I can to get him back and I cherish the time we had together. I have an optimistic hope that he will come back but I've realized that there is a good possibility that he wont, so I have grieved like I wont see him anymore but I hope I get to do so. I still break down and cry when I see his bed, when I feed them in the morning and I dont have his bowl to put down, etc.   I may be rambling a bit, I apologize. Just know that you did your best, you loved him very much and he was happy with you. He may come back or he wont. Keep in mind that you gave him a great life and cherish those happy memories, I wish you the best of luck."
Petloss,2v6htx,andres7832,2,Wed Feb 11 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like we are indeed going through a very similar experience, and a lot of what you described is how I feel as well. I'm beginning to grieve for him as though he is gone forever, and I try to remember that I only allowed him to roam free because I love him so much. It was either that or he'd spend his day sleeping and freaking out that he's stuck inside without his people.  At the same time, it's still hard for me to admit to myself that he may not come back. I see his bed too, and his food bowl next to the others, and I still check his doghouse in case he came back. I carry around his collar in my coat pocket. I've set a date for myself to put up his bed and bowl. We'll keep them in case he comes back, but they'll be out of sight in the spare bedroom.  I've also been giving more attention to our other two dogs. They don't replace Tucker, but even if I don't share quite the same bond with them, they're still comforting.  I really enjoyed your post. I hope your pup comes home."
Petloss,2v6htx,jovialgrimace,2,Thu Feb 12 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"I can't give you much guidance, but Tucker looks like a beautiful dog and you sound like a wonderful owner."
Petloss,2v6htx,tinyirishgirl,2,Sun Feb 8 15:13:43 2015 UTC,Realizing from experience that the unknown is what brings our most difficult pain I found that our deep love is what sustains hope.  And it's our precious memories that gives us strength to keep us going.  Tucker is beautifully handsome.  Zip is lovely too.  I will keep you and Tucker in my heart with hope. Hope and love.
Petloss,2v6htx,NewBlackpony,2,Sun Feb 8 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"Tucker looks like a good boy. I know I'd be heartsick too if I was in this situation. I let one of my dogs loose like yours, but reading your story makes me very nervous. Coyotes are a real problem where I live too. I sure hope somebody finds him and somehow he gets back to you."

He's in puppy heaven thinking of you right now. I'm really sorry for your loss. From reading your post, I can see that loved him very deeply, which I think is very beautiful. Here's to all the great memory you had with your beloved pup. May Furby forever live in your heart and bring a smile to you, as he once did.  RIP Furby"

Petloss,2uyh2y,phoeniixrising,1 point,Fri Feb 6 06:52:14 2015 UTC,It's a struggle trying to deal with a loss like this. I'm doing everything in my power not to think about my girl. When that rare moment comes it feels almost bearable but most of the time I can't get the pain to go away.    I can't say if it's of any benefit to you but I'm trying to take some comfort in knowing my girl isn't suffering anymore and think of the good times when she was healthy and playful. I think about how she loved me unconditionally right up until she was gone and really I just allow myself to feel the pain of her being gone.    I'm sorry for your loss.

Petloss,2uwvt2,susanshoos,2,Thu Feb 5 23:50:16 2015 UTC,"He looks like he was a great companion to you.  I am the same as you, picked my boy dukes ashes up on Tuesday, glad I have him home with me again. Could not fathom the idea of burying him."
Petloss,2uwvt2,ohhwerd,2,Fri Feb 6 00:29:42 2015 UTC,"I had to put my cat Navin down last month due to cancer. He was the first cat I ever personally got and owned (along with my Wife). I had him for 17+ years, and it killed me having to put him down. Prior to that when the Vet gave me the diagnosis, and I was driving home, the radio was playing Coldplay ""The Scientist"" and I lost it driving. Well, yesterday, while driving to work, they played the song again, and sure enough I lost it driving. And I'm sorry being pretentious telling you my story while it might not be near as the heartbreak as your story, but I never really gave any thought to a cat having that much affect to my life. Again, sorry for the rant. Your pain is understandable from this side of the universe."
Petloss,2uwvt2,imgroovy,2,Fri Feb 6 00:46:58 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss, he was a beautiful kitty.  Let the tears flow when you can.  I know that gaping hole in your heart hurts, I've just been through this too.  It's okay to grieve.  He was lucky to have such a caring, loving owner."
Petloss,2uwvt2,a_tad_mental,2,Fri Feb 6 04:08:36 2015 UTC,I picked up my girl's ashes today too and the walk home felt like I was carrying a thousand pounds. I was getting anxious waiting for the clinic to call me to come get her.  Like you there is some tiny measure of solace now that I have her home with me but it feels so strange that she fits in my hand.   If your guy was anything like my girl I know that he undoubtedly loved you every bit as much as you loved him.
Petloss,2uwvt2,dvfex,2,Fri Feb 6 12:53:13 2015 UTC,it feels so strange that she fits in my hand.   I definitely can relate to that. Wheatley was so big (13lbs and legs for days) so it's totally weird but comforting to have him back here.
Petloss,2urjfm,littlepocketknife,4,Wed Feb 4 16:04:32 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss.  I had to put my pup down in November due to a similar history.  He developed seizures and we found out he had an inoperable brain tumor.    Still tear up thinking about him.  I just said yesterday ""I want my baby back"".    Wishing you comfort on the long road to finding the new normal. He was a cutie."
Petloss,2urjfm,a_tad_mental,3,Wed Feb 4 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I keep telling myself the same thing. I had such high hopes for him.

Crying and missing him just means he's still alive in your heart. At least that's what I like to think cuz I've been bawling like a baby all night about missing my pup as well.  Best wishes <3"

It's okay to be sad and angry and it's okay to feel like it isn't fair because it rarely is. You shouldn't feel guilty about your relief- you couldn't plan for this and he would want you to remember him as the young soul that he was.  You'll always feel the loss, but with time the pain will gently fade and leave only the happy and bittersweet memories. You will carry him on in your heart forever."

Petloss,2uovvc,black_opals,5,Tue Feb 3 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. It's the hardest decision you will ever make, and I don't think that we as the owners ever feel like we are ready or that it is time. I recently put down my elderly dog and it was very difficult to make the decision because I was ready to accommodate for his failing body (much like you are doing for your kitty).  I eventually decided to do it because I was afraid of how much pain he would be in if I waited too long. I wanted it to be a quiet and calm passing for him- not a sudden emergency wrought with fear and agony, or passing alone while I'm not at home. As much as I wish there had been more time, I think the regret of waiting too long and seeing him suffer would be worse.  Edit: http://ubertoolcomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ubertool972.jpg"

Petloss,2uovvc,dvfex,3,Wed Feb 4 00:12:16 2015 UTC,I don't know if you've made the decision yet or not but I had to put mine down on the first. To answer your question I don't think anyone really knows and I don't think there is a time. I feel It's about weighing their comfort/pain level vs the pain of losing a loved one.  For me the decision came when she slowed her eating and hadn't used the litterbox in two days. Since that time I've felt a considerable amount of guilt over my decision even though others tell me it was the right thing to do. I think the best thing you can ask yourself is are you prolonging her pain and suffering? If at any point you feel like you are I think that's when it's time to take her in. No matter what the decision wont be easy and you and your kitty have my deepest sympathies.
Petloss,2uovvc,tammyetter,2,Fri Feb 6 12:46:27 2015 UTC,I agree 100% with your post
Petloss,2uovvc,xtagtv,2,Sat Feb 7 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"Hello I want to say I am very very sorry for your loss. I just found out about 30 minutes ago that my cat has the same kind of cancer. I know you are in a tough time, but if you would not mind, please tell me if you found out any information about this topic. (Since it has been 2 days since you posted, maybe you have spoken to someone knowledgable about this). All I can think of right now is, how much longer do I have with her. Nobody has given me a real time table either and I don't want to cause her pain. Thank you for your time and please know, I am suffering with you too"
Petloss,2uovvc,tammyetter,2,Thu Feb 5 23:53:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, in case you didn't see the updated comments, (since you probably don't get notified unless I reply to your comment directly), it has been about 6 weeks since she was officially diagnosed, and about 13 weeks since I first noticed symptoms. Best of luck. My best advice is to try to make her as comfortable as possible."
Petloss,2uovvc,aprilsangels,2,Thu Feb 12 23:30:59 2015 UTC,I lost a kitty to this same thing a few years ago. It is so hard but if you feel she is suffering in any way I would say it is time. Maybe at least seek an opinion from your vet. I don't believe it is best to let them go too long with no hope of getting better. If she is in pain that is not good. Hugs and sad for you but she has had a great life and that is all you can do.
Petloss,2uovvc,SexySushi,2,Sat Feb 7 21:24:34 2015 UTC,I would say its time. I went through same mixed messages. I waited and one morning he jumped in bed with me..ugghh I cant even type about it. Do it now before its too late and you regret it.
Petloss,2uovvc,SexySushi,1 point,Tue Feb 10 00:08:33 2015 UTC,"Hi all,  thank you so much for all of your responses. She is still alive, she started to do better, but today has been a lethargic day for her and I am starting to think that sometime over the next couple of days would be best to put her down. She seems to be having issues drinking water and that's a big deal, it would be painful to be thirsty and not drink as much as you want. She's laid in the same spot all day today and didn't want to eat much for dinner. For those who asked, it's been a little over a month since she was officially diagnosed and about 13 weeks since I first remember noticing symptoms of there being something wrong."
Petloss,2ulzg0,kitsuneko88,7,Tue Feb 3 06:13:50 2015 UTC,Just a thought.  You're a beautiful heart filled with love to share.  This is not being too emotional.  This is being a person of kindness and caring.  This is who you are.  This is who you have to be.  This is your life.
Petloss,2ulzg0,tinyirishgirl,3,Tue Feb 3 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"I came here to comment and offer a word or two in answer to OP's question, but I think your comment is perfectly said. (I needed to hear this too actually)"
Petloss,2ulkr1,Zsokanox,2,Tue Feb 3 03:50:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have an indefinite answer here, but under circumstances of extreme stress I'd say its possible. I lost my buddy today and I can only hope it gets better. Stay strong and be forgiving of yourself"
Petloss,2ulkr1,littlepocketknife,2,Tue Feb 3 05:19:42 2015 UTC,I think it's likely due to stress and/or depression. It might be worth talking to a professional if you feel like it's no longer manageable. Take care of yourself.
Petloss,2ulkr1,dvfex,0,Fri Feb 6 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just saw this.   My dog died two weeks ago from today. And it sucks, I loved the little guy. He was a mutt, lab and a mix of spaniel. Never ever was aggressive, and helped us raise two cats, a father to them.   He lived with my parents most of the time, but he's been my best friend almost. My dad is coping. When we had to put him down, he was crying and I felt awful. We all did.   My dads solution is getting a new puppy. I think, maybe it will help. I don't know. I'm here if you want to talk to me! :)"
Petloss,2ulkr1,jiandersonzer0,1 point,Sat Feb 14 18:46:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're getting down voted...  Anyways I've thought about getting a new dog many times but that will never replace her and I don't want to go through the pain again.   Especially since I had the chance to watch my brothers dogs for a month, I was always comparing and accidentally kept calling one of them my dogs name. In the end they weren't her, so I've decided by the time I'm ready to get a new pet it'll be a cat so I won't make those mistakes.  I'm sorry for your loss Anderson, make sure your dad stays at least emotionally healthy. Good luck to you too if you're overwhelmed or depressed. Thanks for your reply. hugs :)"

Message me or tweet me or whatever sometime and I can spam you pictures of my kitties :) I miss them back home. But they really wouldn't fit here in this apartment.  And hey, I've been alright. Depression hit back in the fall, but I've been more or less prepared for Sirus being gone, I guess. Unrelated, really... We diagnosed him with cancer back in August and held off on letting him go until now. My mom really didn't want to lose him, and the day of the vet visit he was really feeling better."

It's true that during this grieving time we realize how much these wonderful creatures gave to us, and how little they wanted in return. But don't wallow in guilt - I'm sure Smoke had a great life and was loved. Remember all the fun times, silly times, and even just every day times you had with him. I'm sure he was happy just being with you. When my dog of 11 years passed I dug through old pictures and posted a memorial album on Flickr. It made me feel better to see all the times we shared together. I look at it all the time. We also adopted another dog, and I try to do better with him - take him on walks even when it's rainy, make sure I play with him even when I'm too busy, etc. We sometimes don't have the opportunity to do better for the dogs we've lost, but we can for the ones we currently love.  https://www.flickr.com/photos/leeaison/sets/72157638171046826/"

In fact, I just said goodnight to him."

I took my best friend last Thursday and I still feel empty inside and angry that I couldn't do anything for my boy (liver failure). I spent 8 years with him and I wish i'd had more time.

Losing a companion is never easy regardless of the circumstances or how long we are blessed with the privilege of their company.   It sounds like you gave Chino the best life had to offer, and in return Chino gave all of you his best.  That is true unconditional love.  May you be comforted by the peace of knowing that you provided a loving home to Chino for all those years you had together.   Of course it hurt you to see him not eating/drinking and in pain.  I imagine it was very agonizing to see your beloved precious Chino not doing well at all, after all Chino's family, he has been a part of your family through good times and probably some bad times as well (and always greeted you with happiness every time).   Oh Bless your heart for consoling him and letting him know you were there for him.  That is a testament to the deep love and dedication you shared.  Even if you spoke not word to him, rest assured he already knew just how much you and your family loved him.  Sometimes there are no need for words because the heart already knows.  He knew what true unconditional love was and that is because of you and your family.    It sounds like you had a very deep loving and strong bond with Chino.  The bond you and your beloved Chino share is eternal - - it is not restricted to the physical laws of time and space. Your beloved Chino's sweet Living Spirit continues to share your earthly journey as he always has and always will - - for he is always and forever a part of your heart and your memories - - he is always and forever a heartbeat close to you.  It seems that your lives have been immeasurably enriched by Chino's presence. I realize making the decision to end Chino's suffering is a very painful decisions.   It is perhaps the ultimate heartbreak we must be willing to endure for our adored companion animal.  For every joy that passes, something beautiful remains. Love will remain and grow - and be there for us to remember.  It is a love we have earned. It is the legacy our pets leave us when they go. And it is a gift we may keep with us as long as we live. It is a Love which is ours alone. It is a Love that we will always possess.  Wishing you peace to bring comfort, courage to face the days ahead and loving memories to forever hold in your hearts.

His suffering was short in comparison to his years of great life and unconditional love he gave.  I thank you so much for taking the time to say such sweet words about my best bud chino!

Petloss,2u1rvg,psylocke_and_trunks,5,Thu Jan 29 04:43:00 2015 UTC,"I am deeply sorry! My heart goes out to you and your fur baby boy! It sounds like you two have an amazing and strong bond. Bless your heart, you are wonderful and caring person, and your post you posted tells me of the strong love and dedication you two share.  I must say that your boy is a very gorgeous boy!!  I imagine that making this decision is one of the most difficult things you will have ever had to go through.Your decision to end his suffering involves great personal courage and sacrifice, but it also takes an extraordinary amount of selfless love. It is perhaps the ultimate heartbreak. It is the last act of unconditional love you are giving to him. After all the years of your Bubba, your Duder giving you unconditional love, take solace that you are giving that same love back one last time.  I realize with the deep sorrow you are facing right now and you probably do not need to many thoughts or ideas being given to you. However please allow me one thought for you and boy. This is just a thought, I wonder if it would be less traumatic/stressful if you could get the vet to come to to your place to release him of his suffering, this way he would be in his own comfortable surroundings where he feels the most comfortable and loved.  Reading your post I can feel that you are very devastated, and I can sense your deep and profound love for him.  . You are right, he does deserve to have all the best things across the Rainbow Bridge, and he will.  I bet if you really concentrate and close your eyes you just may be able to see him happy there.  May God wrap both you and your boy with his amazing grace and provide peace, comfort and mercy.  Please Give him a love for me. I am so glad that you and your Bubba shared such a wonderful life together.  Maybe you could fix him his favorite food as a extra special treat. I am sure you already know that your boy understand what you are saying to him, so take this time to tell him just why he is so very special to you.  My heart truly goes out to both of you. You both are in my thoughts, heart and prayers.  Sincerely Rosann"

Petloss,2ty4lb,captainferret2,2,Wed Jan 28 18:51:40 2015 UTC,I am so sorry for your loss. This past May I lost my little guy Jerry due to seizures also. He was only 3. It's hard when you know you've done everything and it's still not enough. Take comfort in knowing that he is over the bridge and out of pain. Rest in peace beautiful boy.
Petloss,2ty4lb,captainferret2,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:36:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. The seizures are horrible, especially when they happen to someone you love so dearly. I just can't stop thinking about all the years of mountain trips, summer days on the beach, and hours of cuddling we should have had together in the future. I'm sorry you also had to go trough this. May your Jerry rest in peace."

He was my little boy and I miss him so much. One thing I believe is that they are at peace now. Again, I am so very sorry for your loss."

And though you call a dozen living dogs to heel they should not growl at him, nor resent his coming, for he is yours and he belongs there.   People may scoff at you, who see no lightest blade of grass bent by his footfall, who hear no whimper pitched too fine for mere audition, people who may never really have had a dog. Smile at them then, for you shall know something that is hidden from them, and which is well worth the knowing.   The one best place to bury a good dog is in the heart of his master."

Losing a companion is never easy regardless of the circumstances or how long we are blessed with the privilege of their company.   Thank you for sharing ClaraBug's photo.  ClaraBug is simply beautiful.  I imagine this has been a very tragic, traumatic and devastating experience for both of you.  My heart goes out to you, your wife and your other kitty cat during this very difficult time.   It sounds like you and your wife gave ClaraBug the best of everything for those 2.5 years. And it also sounds like you were both very awesome pet parents.  May you be comforted by the peace of knowing that you provided a loving home to ClaraBug for the time you had together.Sometimes you can do everything right and still have a bad outcome.  We live in an imperfect world and there are circumstances that are beyond our control.   Please know that ClaraBug did not die feeling unloved.  Rest assured that ClaraBug knew what true unconditional love really was and that is because of you and your wife.  So when she drew her last breath she already knew how much she was loved.  Sometimes there are no need for words, because the heart already knows. I am glad to hear that you have another cat, because that means ClaraBug did not die all alone, her friend was there (your other cat).    The bond you and your beloved ClaraBug share is eternal - - it is not restricted to the physical laws of time and space.

It is the legacy our pets leave us when they go. And it is a gift we may keep with us as long as we live. It is a Love which is ours alone.   Grief is the last act of love we have to give to those we loved.  Where there is deep grief, there was great love.  I pray that tomorrow's results will bring you both some comfort and peace.  No one is ever prepared for a loss no matter what.  You won't get over it. I don't believe we ever ""get over"" the loss of someone we've loved so much. But you'll do something much better.

I imagine this is a very tragic, traumatic and devastating loss for you. I am so very deeply sorry. In my opinion, I would highly recommend that you call your vet and explain what occurred and also explain to him/her about the mucus. Perhaps then you might be able to have a professional opinion on this matter. I can only imagine how much you are in need of an answer as to what happened, so maybe you might feel a bit more at peace. For most people that has experienced a sudden death, it is in the not knowing for sure that is probably the most painful part. I do agree with one of the posters with the fact that it could have been heart related. Most sudden deaths in cats are caused by Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. However the symptom that does not fit (that I know of) is the thick brown mucus coming from the nose and mouth. With this fact in my own thought, I would wonder if your precious cat may have ingested a toxin/poison or something to that nature. I would like to add that, we live in an imperfect, broken world and sometimes there are circumstances that are beyond our control.   For every joy that passes, something beautiful remains,  Love will remain and grow - and be there for us to remember.It is a love we have earned. It is the legacy our pets leave us when they go.

They were alcoholics, and sometimes they would set up beer bottles as bowling pins and use the cat as a bowling ball. They would laugh when they told this story as if it was something funny. When we first got him he was always scared and hid anywhere we couldn't find him. After he realized he was safe with us he became so outgoing and friendly.

Petloss,2tpp25,WarrenR,3,Mon Jan 26 14:32:03 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry.  I just had to put my Chihuahua down right before Thanksgiving.  I'm a veterinarian and even when I was injecting him I kept saying (with tears streaming down my face) I didn't want him to go, but he had an inoperable brain tumor and the seizures were occurring daily.  I'm still in the grieving process and am crying as I type this.  I broke down in tears every day, multiple times; New Year's day was the first day I didn't cry.  I still tear up many times a week.  My husband still tears up.  I'm at first hesitant to tell him when I'm thinking of our pup, but I tell myself there's no sense in denying my emotions.  I agree with another poster, see if you can get a vet to come to your home.  Also have a friend there.  I had my husband holding my little guy.  He was the first pet my husband and I had together.  Out of all my Chihuahuas, he was the only one to come and comfort me when I was sad (had him for 13 years, he comforted me through a lot of tough times).  It was hard because once he was gone, none of my other three Chihuahuas would come and comfort me, I had to go grab them.  It was no joke when I used to say he was the favorite.  I also chat with my best friend who had to put her bull terrier down 6 weeks before I had to put mine down. I still don't want to say goodbye, but I had to.  Unfortunately nature doesn't let them live forever.  Honestly things will not get better, only worse, to relieve them of the suffering is the best thing we can do for them. It's a difficult road you're embarking on, but has to be done.  Let yourself grieve, you have every right to grieve.  If you find yourself in too dark of a place find counseling. My 84 year old grandfather would still tear up when talking about his childhood dog.  This was a stoic, war veteran, who would tear up.  I'm pretty sure that will be me with the loss of my little baby and I'm okay with that. If you're still having trouble, come back on here to look for support.  This is my first venture back as emotionally I hadn't been able to come back here until recently.  Sometimes it's comforting to talk/chat with others in the same position. I'm so sorry, it sucks, it really does.  Internet Hugs"

Petloss,2tpp25,aiiiiida,3,Mon Jan 26 19:08:58 2015 UTC,"Hi there,  I lost my bassador, Odie, almost two weeks ago to cancer. It's a long story, but in short, he deteriorated very quickly after his diagnosis, but I'd made myself sick from reading each night for almost two months so in a sense had begun to mourn him then.  I knew that it would likely come to my decision to say goodbye to him. Unfortunately, after trying multiple treatment options, he showed signs of being in pain, so that was it for me. I vowed that I'd do whatever I could to not cry while it was all happening and focus on making Odie comfortable. I'm sorry I don't have any better advice, but if and when it comes time for you to make the decision, do everything that you can to stay calm for him. He doesn't know what is happening to him, all he knows is the relief that you're so generously choosing to provide him. The drive is something awful, so if anybody can come with you, please do bring someone. While everything was being prepared, I lightly stroked Odie's fur and talked only in small bits to keep from crying. If I felt the urge to cry, I'd pick something out of the office room to focus on for a few seconds (designs in a carpet, frames on the walls). It wasn't until he left me that I lost it, bawling my eyes out as I'd done many nights before leading up to this.  My first dog, Bambi, was a chihuahua who I lost during my last year of high school. I still will never know why, but I faked sick the night before he died to stay with him, and I'm so glad that I was able to spend time with him.   I would love to see your little guy, if you're up for sharing. Be tough for him, but then remember to allow yourself whatever feelings come next. <3"
Petloss,2tpp25,HippieSoulPunx,3,Mon Jan 26 15:57:46 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for what you're going through. I've had two dogs who've died; one was put to sleep, and I was only 10, so I didn't go in with the vet, my parents did. The other died a few years ago, but he died at home, and I was with him while he died. I never really said goodbye, I just hugged him a lot and kissed his head and put a blanket on him so he wouldn't be cold.   Say whatever you want to say; thank him for his unconditional love, talk about some nice memories, say goodbye, say words of reassurance. Maybe some people would find that stupid, because dogs can't understand most of what we say, but they like the sound/tone of our voice, and it helps us, too. When the first dog was put to sleep (when I was 10), my mum said she kept telling her she's a good girl, and ""Where's your bone?"" because she had a squeaky toy bone that she always loved. And my mum said when she said that, her tail was wagging. So if there's a word or phrase that might make your dog feel happy, maybe you can say that, too.  Maybe you can get the vet to come to your house. If not, get a friend or family member to drive you there. Sending you some love, it's a horrible thing you're going through."
Petloss,2tpp25,GentleObsession,2,Mon Jan 26 19:07:49 2015 UTC,"I recently went through this. My dog was also 10 but had liver failure.

There was literally a week between the day I took her to the vet (to see what was wrong with her) and the day I had her put down. Going from a seemingly fine dog in great spirits one week to, over the course of the week, lose her desire to play, go for walks, eat, or really do anything. She seemed completely done. I think she must have been in so much pain by the end because she simply did not want to do anything but lay on my bed and barely respond to me.  It was so fast. I cried so much during that week and almost felt kind of numb to it all for the week after and now I am back to really feeling it. It really sucks.   But aside from my stuff. Does you dog act fairly normal right now? I'd enjoy the last bit of time he has left. Once he is showing he is in pain, as hard as it is, you've got to relieve him of his pain and let him go. If you have a friend or family member you're comfortable with asking, I recommend having someone else go with you for morale support and to drive you."
Petloss,2tpp25,intuitivemomma1,2,Tue Jan 27 05:01:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe see if a vet will come to you. And they'll do it in the comfort of your home. He can sleep in his dog bed or in your lap surrounded by things he's familiar with, as he leaves this world and enters the next. Surrounded by the place he knew as comfort and love. Then you don't have to do anything other than be there and pet him or hold him."
Petloss,2tpp25,robotrout,2,Tue Jan 27 14:52:53 2015 UTC,I lost my best friend chi last June from heart failure. I too had to make the decision to let her go peacefully. Spoil him if you can. Keep him as comfortable as possible. When it is time allow yourself to experience your emotions. Don't try to be tough or put on a happy face. Grieve as long as it takes. It will come and go in waves as time passes. Feel free to write down you feelings or thoughts if it helps. I write to my girl everyday still. I also wear her tag around my neck so she feels close. Find a support group nearby. Talking to others helps. I also read Bill at Rainbow Bridge which was a touching story. I now find myself preparing to say goodbye to a second friend due to renal failure. It will be just as difficult. Take care and know there are others going through this with you. Your bud will always be in your heart.
Petloss,2tpp25,robotrout,1 point,Tue Jan 27 16:03:30 2015 UTC,"I am going to ask a completely emotional, and not logical question: would anyone on here pay $6,000 for a kidney transplant, even if you don't have the money? As in, taking a second mortgage out on your house? I found out today I have that option.  Am I just 'not letting go' and being selfish?"
Petloss,2tpp25,gosalyn87,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"I think it would depend on the quality of life. If the surgery is successful and buys additional years of good life maybe. Could you live with the decision if it went bad or didn't work? That would be my question. Also, the money is a considerable amount and would weigh in for me depending on the risk. These are always hard decisions."

We had the surgery done, but unfortunately, his little heart couldn't handle it, and he passed a few hours later.  When I picked him up from the Vet, he had his head up, his eyes were open, but he had a blank expression. My little best friend didn't even recognize me.   I am so hurting right now."
Petloss,2tnzum,colemacgrath,5,Sun Jan 25 23:59:15 2015 UTC,"I am deeply sorry!  My heart goes out to you and Abbie!  It sounds like you and Abbie have an amazing and strong bond.  Bless your heart, you are wonderful and caring person, and knowing that you are laying on the ground with her crying your eyes out, only tells me of the strong love and dedication you two share.  I agree with you, making this decision is one of the most difficult things you will ever have to go through.Your decision to end Abbie's suffering involves great personal courage and sacrifice, but it also takes an extraordinary amount of selfless love. It is perhaps the ultimate heartbreak.   It is the last act of unconditional love you are giving to her. After all the years of Abbie giving you unconditional love take solace that you are giving that same love back one last time.  I realize with the deep sorrow you are facing right now you probably do not need to many thoughts or ideas being given to you.  However please allow me one thought for you and Abbie. This is just a thought, could your vet come to you at your house to let Abby go? This way both of you would not have any extra unnecessary trauma/stresses.  Abby would be in her own comfortable surroundings where she feels the most comfortable and loved.  I imagine you are pretty devastated.    God wrap both you and Abbie with his amazing grace and provide peace, comfort and mercy.    Please Give Abbie a love for me.  You know Abbie feels your pain as much as you feel her's.  I am so glad that you and Abbie shared such a wonderful time together.  Maybe if Abbie is still able to eat you could fix her her favorite food as a extra special treat.  I am sure you already know that Abbie understand what you are saying to her, so take this time to tell just why she is so very special to you.  My heart truly goes out to both of you.  You both are in my prayers.    Sincerely Rosann"

She was very sick and clearly in pain, we were always worried about leaving her alone in case something happened while we were out. Getting her put down was both the hardest and the easiest thing I've ever done. She was my best friend for most of my life, but there was a sense of relief that came with easing her suffering. I really really recommend being there for it if you can - you will regret it if you don't. Abbie needs you now more than ever! Sending hugs your way, my friend <3"

Petloss,2tnzum,RosannT,2,Mon Jan 26 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry :( it's a horrible thing to go through, to lose a loved one, but especially when you're seeing them suffer. But it sounds like you have so many wonderful memories with her, so cherish them and know that you gave her a lovely life, and I'm sure she's experienced so much love and affection. We all have to die, but those who do so after living a life filled with love are blessed. You gave her that opportunity, and I'm sure she gave you unconditional love also.  It'll take time to get used to it, and to go through the grieving process, but with time, it becomes easier to remember the good memories with them than to focus on the sadness. I feel for you, I really do, but just cherish the time spent with Abbie and know that it's her time to go, and she'll be free of the suffering she's in. Try to be strong for her in her last moments and, if you can, be with her when she's put to sleep. I was with my old dog, Zac, when he died, and I don't know if it was a comfort to him at all, but for some reason, it really helped me gain a sense of closure and comfort to be there in the very end.  Sending you love and support <3"

Just got this in the mail and only just worked up the nerve to look at it and post it again.  http://i.imgur.com/8177tNA.jpg  Cooking has been different. She always used to be underfoot, ready for a treat. For the first few days I kept looking expecting that familiar begging face.   Past few days cleaning has been difficult. I keep finding the little rubber grommets she liked to play with under furniture. As a little background on that, she took to playing with them as a puppy and would pick them up in her mouth and then flip them into the air and go chasing them wherever they bounced. Of course, they'd wind up lost so I made sure there were spares... and that's how they got into all the weirdest nooks and crannies I keep finding them in.  And thanks for tolerating my followup. I just needed to share somewhere."

Losing a companion is never easy regardless of the circumstances or how long we are blessed with the privilege of their company.  My heart truly goes out to you!  I can imagine just how devastated you are. It sounds like you were and still are such a wonderful pet parent. And may you be comforted by the peace of knowing that you provided a loving home to Louie for those three years you had together.   The one thing I know for sure is this, Louie knew what true unconditional love was, and that is because of you.  I bet you have hundreds of irreplaceable awesome memories, that are yours to always cherish.  The bond you and your beloved Louie share is eternal - - it is not restricted to the physical laws of time and space. Your beloved Louie's sweet Living Spirit continues to share your earthly journey as he always has and always will - - for he is always and forever in your heart and memories - - he is always and forever a heartbeat close to you.  I bet your life has been immeasurable enriched because of his presence. I know for a fact, that with time, these wounds will begin to heal. You will get through this. Not over it, but through. As most of us have heard many times over,""With every day that passes, a little healing takes place and things get a little bit easier"" that's true. I won't say better, because nothing makes this better, but it does get easier.   Wishing you peace to bring comfort, courage to face the days ahead and loving memories to forever hold in your hearts.  Sincerely Rosann  “The risk of love is loss, and the price of loss is grief.  But the pain of grief is only a shadow when compared with the pain of never risking love.” (Hilary Stanton Zunin)  What we have once enjoyed  we can never lose; All that we love deeply, becomes a part of us. -Helen Keller  How lucky we are to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.  Grief is the last act of love we have to givr to those we loved.  Where there is deep grief, there was great love.  There are no goodbyes for us. Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart.

Petloss,2thvpp,AliceSora,3,Sun Jan 25 10:35:37 2015 UTC,"We know just what you're feeling. I still grieve and miss my animals from when I was a little kid. Love is the strongest emotion, and it's going to hurt to lose who we love. The most important thing to remember is that just because they have passed on does not mean you're supposed to stop loving them.   Don't forget all the good times you had with him, you gave him a better life, and no one could have loved him more than you, and he was happiest with you. Please don't forget this.  It always helps comfort me to visit my animals graves and keep planted flowers for them. With time I hope you will realize that giving a good life to an animal is worth more than the pain we feel when we lose them."

Just take it in small steps. Drink some water,have a snack, take a long, deep breath, maybe exercise if you're up for it (it will make you feel a bit better, trust me). It hurts, I know, and sometimes you just have to wait for the sadness to pass. Try to think about how happy you made each other. It sounds cheesy but it helps. And I agree with the other posters you should look into getting a new cat when you're ready. Don't think of it as abandoning your love for your old cat, but instead as making a new friend. Hope this helps at least a little!"

They gave him a diuretic and said he would be fine. Later that night, around 1 AM, he died in my arms. I tear up thinking about that night to this day.

Petloss,2tbhom,DistantHawk,5,Thu Jan 22 19:30:08 2015 UTC,"Please permit me to add my sincerest sympathies in the physical loss of your beloved Fur baby. Losing a companion is never easy regardless of the circumstances or how long we are blessed with the privilege of their company. I am very sorry that you did not get the chance to say goodbye with him awake.  But believe me he heard you! And without any doubt he knows how much you love him and how much you miss him.  Because I know he feels the same about you.  Sometimes love needs no words, because the heart already knows.    The good news in the midst of all your deep sorrow is that the love bond you and your beloved fur baby share is eternal - - it is not restricted to the physical laws of time and space. Your beloved fur baby's sweet Living Spirit continues to share your earthly journey as he always has and always will - - for he is always and forever a part of your heart and your memories - - he is always and forever a heartbeat close to you.  Unfortunately, there are several reasons why it can be very easy to miss signs that a dog or cat is in pain. First, they hide pain. In fact, when it comes to concealing pain from disease or injury, most are capable of an Academy award winning performance, and it is because of their origins and their survival instincts in the wild. In the wild, a sick or injured animal is vulnerable to attack, so survival can depend on the animal’s ability to act like everything is fine even when something is terribly wrong.    I have to tell you, I know for a fact, that with time, these wounds begin to heal. You will get through this. Not over it, but through. That hole will always be there, but it gets easier every day to cover the hole and remember the happy stuff. And soon enough, you will find that you aren't crying over the loss and sadness anymore......you're living life, you're carrying on and you're smiling at the good memories you have of your beloved pet, your pal, your best friend....  Wishing you peace to bring comfort, courage to face the days ahead and loving memories to forever hold in your hearts. Sincerely Rosann  Unable are the loved to die, for love is immortality.

Your story grabbed my attention instantly and I sat and cried for you and your precious fur baby, then I went ahead and joined just so I could reply to your post.  You know for every joy that passes, something beautiful remains.  I imagine your life has been immeasurably enriched by his presence.  I would like to share this poem with you, it is called Gifts.  GIFTS  They come to us,  from shelters or friends or in any number of ways, these beings of fur or feather or other outer shells.  They come to us wanting only  to be fed, sheltered, and loved. And we take them into our homes and our hearts.  They may have prized pedigrees,  or they may be abandoned or abused  and rough around the edges.  But there is something about them,  some sort of light in their eyes  that tells us they are meant for us. And a sweet dance of love  begins with our new friends.  We watch them delightedly discover their new home,  laugh at the antics of kitten or puppy,  smile as the former lost soul  settles comfortably into our arms. They become a beloved member of our family,  a reminder of the uninhibited joy  that we have often forgotten how to feel.  The dog that excitedly runs  to greet his human friend returning home,  or the contented cat curled up on a lap  remind us of how large  unfettered love can be. They come to teach us to remember how to love.  They come to teach us that our hearts,  so often battered by this world that we struggle through,  are still open enough to feel wonder and mystery  and a precious connection to another being. And we love them, and care for them,  and experience the joy  we thought was lost from our lives. But life is fragile.  One day, perhaps unexpectedly,  or perhaps after a long struggle with illness,  our precious friends are gone. And we mourn them deeply.  We feel lost, and alone,  and that the joy is once again gone from our lives.  We feel anger, and pain, and fear. We question Deity, and wonder why. Life is fragile.  Their lives are more fragile than ours.  We cannot escape death,  and for it to take our most precious friends,  who ask so little,  seems unfair and too much for us to bear. But they leave us always with a gift.  They leave us with that love they gave, that joy they sparked.  Our hearts are larger for having loved them.  We are enriched by having these special souls in our lives,  even if it was for too brief a time. Love never dies.  And the love that was created  by our special friends who came into our lives  is a living thing,  always a part of our being. We may think our hearts are closing again,  but we cannot erase the fact  that they have been opened. They teach us love for a reason:  so that we will have it in our hearts always.  Each day, each act of kindness or love,  is a tribute to our pets who have moved on. Honor your special friend with kindness and love.  Each day, reach out to your living companions  and let them know how precious they are. Reach out to others in your life  and let the love your friend brought you live on.  Reach out to others in need, whether human or animal. I can think of no better gift than the love they teach us.  And I can think of no better way to honor their memories  than by extending that love.  In this way, they will truly live forever."

Petloss,2tadhm,DarkQueen83,2,Thu Jan 22 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"In the same boat man. My best friend had to go out today, took him to the vets yesterday for a lame leg and found out he had a tumor the size of a football attached to his spleen or so they thought. Turns out it was all through him, and had spread to his main arteries and destroyed one of his kidneys. they put him down on the table when operating so i didnt even get to say goodbye with him awake. Funny thing is he never showed any sort of discomfort or pain."
Petloss,2t8cwy,willisan,2,Thu Jan 22 00:14:57 2015 UTC,We did this to our 11-year old newfoundland dog when she passed away in early October 2012 - it was so much better than driving to the vet. Having our pooch peacefully pass away in our backyard and cross over to the Rainbow Bridge was sad but I know she was happy until the very end.
Petloss,2t8cwy,127crazie,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"Please permit me to add my sincerest sympathies in the physical loss of your beloved Honey. Losing a companion is never easy regardless of the circumstances or how long we are blessed with the privilege of their company.  Bless your hearts!  Thank you for taking into consideration the feelings of your precious fur baby in regards to him hating going to the vets.  How wonderful of you to find such a perfect solution by having a vet come to your home so that you all could say goodbye there, were he was the most comfortable and loved.  This tells me of the love and dedication you shared.  If I do run across anyone in the Eastern MA area, I will refer them to your post, so that they may have the number to your awesome vet.  It sounds like they treated you and your precious fur baby with the utmost respect.  Sincerely Rosann"

Petloss,2t744c,HINAT4,2,Wed Jan 21 18:43:34 2015 UTC,I am so concerned for you both.  The only way I can see this through his pain and your worry is that we would want someone to care and love us enough if positions were reversed to not make us suffer day after day in pain that  we could not bear or understand.  It is his time right now to be loved and released.  Holding you both close and in my heart.
Petloss,2t744c,tinyirishgirl,1 point,Wed Jan 21 21:18:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice and concern. Do you think it sounds like he should be put out of his pain?
Petloss,2t744c,tinyirishgirl,1 point,Wed Jan 21 21:23:51 2015 UTC,I do.  And as soon as you can make that appointment with your vet.
Petloss,2t744c,tinyirishgirl,1 point,Wed Jan 21 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice, how would I tackle my aunt with this? Should I do it silently and tell her he passed on his own (and we sorted out the body)? She has told me, no matter what, she doesn't want him to be put down. Sigh :("
Petloss,2t744c,read_for_me_baby,2,Wed Jan 21 21:35:21 2015 UTC,I think his interests are the single most important thing to keep in your mind and your heart.    It seems to me that to cruelly keep him in his suffering condition is just something that you must end.  I know it's so hard but you just have to show him this love.
Petloss,2t744c,tex045,2,Wed Jan 21 21:45:02 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you're faced with this decision, and while I understand your aunt's desire to have him pass naturally, I feel that we shouldn't put our pets through unnecessary pain when we have such a peaceful, kind way to help them be free.   With that said, have you considered acupuncture? My old-ish schnauzer has arthritis in her back, and in the cold she's nearly immobile. We started her on acupuncture this winter, and she's a completely different dog. She dances around the kitchen and runs around the yard like a puppy. Plus, she doesn't have to take any pain medication anymore, which helps protect her liver and kidneys.   It can be a bit pricey (our first visit was about $150, and it's $80 for bi-weekly follow-ups), but it's non-invasive and gentle. If you're considering putting the dog down, this is a good last option. If it doesn't work, then you can confidently say you tried everything possible to help him.   If he's being aggressive due to the pain, acupuncture could change this behavior. If you try it a few times and he doesn't improve, then there may be something deeper going on.   Good luck! Again, I'm sorry you're in this position."
Petloss,2t744c,tex045,1 point,Fri Jan 23 01:21:46 2015 UTC,"I know you want to respect your aunts wishes but you ultimately have to do what is right for the dog. If he is in constant pain, the humane thing to do would be to put him down. You, though, are the only one that knows truly what to do... Prayers and best wishes to you through this process"

Honor his life by visiting where you walked and played and you might feel him still there with you.

The most important thing is making sure he isn't in pain. Once he's at a place where you know you would be ready if the positions were switched, it's time. From what I understand FIP is a fairly uncommon reaction to the virus, but I understand why you're worried about his sister. You two will need one another in this time. Enjoy what time you have with both of them be it days or a decade. Your little friend will always live on in your memory."

Losing a companion is never easy regardless of the circumstances or how long we are blessed with the privilege of their company Let me ask you this, what if you and Furball had never met?  Take a few minutes now and think about what Furball's life could have been like if you were not together.  Furball's life could have been far worse.  Let Furball be your teacher and honor him by learning from the life, the love and the challenges you experienced together.  Furball would want you to have a good life and be happy.  Think back... Wasn't Furball communicating this to you when he was alive?  Furball was there for you and would not want you to suffer now.  You can never replace Furball, but hopefully down the line you will be able to give your heart and home to another fur baby.

I have also lost my basset mix (basset/lab), named Odie. My fiance, bf at the time, never had a family pet during childhood and wasn't really into dogs. At their introduction, Odie jumped right into his lap and started ""speaking basset"" to him, groaning and howling, which he did very rarely, and started licking his face. This was the time they fell in love, I'm sure of it. My fiance became instrumental in some of the treatment required in the last month of Odie's life; it's amazing how bonded anyone that comes into our beloved pet's life can become.  I've kept his favorite blanket (a quilt our older neighbors made for him years ago) by my side and oddly enough, it's helped to keep my mind on better memories. Scarlet was clearly lucky to be surrounded with so much love, so take a moment to realize what you've all provided for her -- it's clear to see what she gave all of you within the history of your family."

Obviously i know the pain oh too well.  Tonight was the first night I went to my parents since she's been gone.  The minute I walked down the stairs and saw that her crate was gone, I just started bawling. I had also just come back from the funeral home.  But then my 17 yr old nephew farted and I started laughing @ him.  I know it'll take a lot of time and Daphne and Rufus r both old so now I'm on that worry kick.  Plus we have a 13yr old cat that is sickly.  She's my fiacees baby sooo.  She's mine too but he's had her since she was a kitten.  We worry about her a lot but she's a tough cookie.

Petloss,2sbkpw,TheSassyCowgirl,3,Tue Jan 13 20:51:32 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry. I have to make this decision for my cat on Thursday. It's killing me. But it's time.
Petloss,2sbkpw,NeonBatman,3,Wed Jan 14 00:07:32 2015 UTC,"What a beautiful girl. It sounds like she loved you with all her heart, holding you like that in her last moments. Take it one day at a time - that's what I'm having to do right now. It's all we can do."
Petloss,2sbkpw,Clairabel,2,Wed Jan 14 01:53:17 2015 UTC,"That's all that's keeping me going. Her love for me, remembering those last moments and just going day by day. It's so much harder than I ever dreamed it would be."
Petloss,2sbkpw,merespeckofdust,3,Wed Jan 14 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"I'm soo sorry for your loss. HEY! Sheee had a great life with you!! you gave her the best quality of life ever! Please stop being too sad, she wouldn't  want you to be sooo sorrowful and painfully sad.  You were a great mom and a friend to her, and you both had great companionship.   I'm very sorry, I can't even begin to imagine how much you miss her. but I think you should celebrate her life she spent with you!!  She is the luckiest horse ever to have you as a friend! imagine her life other persons hand. I'm 100% you've given her the horsey heaven. From what yo're saying you had an almost a soul connection! So how lucky are you to have a pet like THAT!   Celebrate that!!  cheers  ps: i teared quite a bit"
Petloss,2sbkpw,aiiiiida,3,Wed Jan 14 05:35:11 2015 UTC,"I've only joined reddit a short bit ago, only to get some Vet advice to start for my ailing dog. I've never posted or written about pet loss until yesterday, and it's helped quite a bit, even knowing that most won't read through the entire thing. I read through your entire story, and it's really something special. This is a testament to your loving heart as well.   Bonanza is a beautiful part of your story that you'll always cherish; you were both very lucky to grow together. It's incredibly saddening to wake up and realize all the ways in which you've been left alone and certainly easier. As I woke up crying this morning, I reminded myself of better memories with my Odie and what lessons he's taught us all as the nucleus of my pretty disfunctional family. It's really hard to break out of the sadness to think of the older, better days with our loved ones, but I'm slowly learning that it's far more rewarding and respectful to their legacy.  She was definitely brave for you, but you were also brave for her when she needed you most, which should leave you with a new lesson about your own strengths."
Petloss,2sbkpw,bottegaveneta,2,Wed Jan 14 14:05:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm so sorry for your loss. But it was still wonderful to read about the amazing bond you two had. It's beautiful and I'm glad you two got to spend 16 years together. Sounds like she had a great life and you should be proud of that. I don't have any pets and I live in NYC, so I don't get to see wildlife very often, but sometimes I go upstate and there are farms and animal sanctuaries and I always love seeing the horses. They just seem so especially gentle and loving, so your post really touched me. I hope you're holding up well."

Petloss,2s4buo,legitkid,1 point,Mon Jan 12 05:21:44 2015 UTC,"My cat I had to put down today only made it 13 1/2 :/ he had a heart attack, we got him to the vet and he told us his kidneys are huge (we knew about that tho), his lungs were full of water and his heart was also enlarged. He was breathing heavily the last few days and today suddenly he stopped walking on one paw I touched it and it was ice cold. Once we arrived at the vet his tongue started to become blue as did his nose, they said they could super sonic check his heart and put him on heart meds, but even then the chances are very slim. Seeing him grasping for air trying to clean himself with his blue tongue was just too much for me and I decided to put him down. Today was a bad day."
Petloss,2s2xev,DaniAlexander,4,Sun Jan 11 18:47:19 2015 UTC,My dearest there is absolutely nothing to apologize for not now not ever.  Cat was your person all those years.   You were his person all those years.    When you bring home your new person it is not replacing Cat.  What it really is sharing all that magic and wonderful love that you and Cat created together.  You have so much kindness and love to give.  Holding you and Cat in my heart.   RIP Cat

I just went through the same thing, and yeah, I know how hard it is.  Its been 4 days and I can't even tell anyone about it without falling apart...and I'm a 38 year old metalhead.

Petloss,2rw6rg,earworms,4,Fri Jan 9 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"In regards to bringing the other cat to the vet, have you considered in home euthanasia. This would more comfortable for everyone involved and would allow your other cat to visit at the end. Ask your vet if they offer this or if they know anyone that does. I have researched this already for my pets and found several vets in my city that offer in home euthanasia.   I am very sorry that you have to go through this. It is the hardest part of loving our fury friends."
Petloss,2rw6rg,twanky,2,Fri Jan 9 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, that actually has been a thought of mine. A Youtuber I follow did this and did a video regarding the process and how it all went. It honestly seems like such a comforting option all around. I am not aware if my vet (or any in my area) preform it. I should have asked while I was there, but there was a ton of stuff I was thinking about. I'm sure they do. I know it can get spendy, but I'll definitely look into it. Thanks."
Petloss,2rw6rg,susanshoos,2,Fri Jan 9 22:26:06 2015 UTC,"This is really rough and I am very sorry this is happening. I've never heard of bringing another animal to witness the end, have you asked your vet about this?"
Petloss,2rw6rg,tammyetter,3,Fri Jan 9 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"No not yet. I didn't think about it till we got home. It makes since to ask just to see if it's even viable. My cat has attachment issues to begin with, so I started to worry how she would handle it. I guess I don't even know if cats understand the concept of death (or even care). I might just be projecting my feelings as well. I guess I'm just curious if people have shown their deceased pets to other pets, and if they felt like it helped, or how people have dealt with it. This is my first time owning two pets at the same time, so I'm concerned of course."
Petloss,2rw6rg,tammyetter,2,Fri Jan 9 22:16:13 2015 UTC,I think they do understand when one is gone they can also prescribe antidepressants to cats now
Petloss,2rw6rg,kittymeeowmeeow,2,Sat Jan 10 14:32:27 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear this. But when the time comes I would consider having the vet come to your home. It will be an adjustment for your other kitty but she will be fine with some extra love from you. I lost a kitty at 19 to a cancer in his mouth and had another kitty he grew up with. Cute kitty in the picture
Petloss,2rw6rg,somecow,2,Sat Jan 10 14:31:24 2015 UTC,"I totally understand where you are coming from. I guess it's not a typical thing, but my parents always brought our pets home and buried them in the back yard. My mom would always make sure the other animals saw/sniffed the one that had been put to sleep because she thought it helped them to understand that they were gone."

SMokey as lost due to something wrong with his mouth. he was younger than when the other 2 passed.i thought i would have him longer. and i had been away from the house when he rapidly declined. i came home hoping to have at least a week with him. but i saw he was in pain.bleeding from the mouth. i got 2 days. i will never forgive myself for not being there. prepair yourself by spending time with Max. make sure he knows he is a good cat. that he is loved. i do not know what else to tell you. but be there for him. no matter what. fuck work,fuck obligations,fuck evrythign. stay with him. do his favret things.   i think you will know when it is truly time to make that call.untill then spend all the time you can with him. so you wont have to live knowing you were not there. so you wont whisper that you are sorry as you lay in bed each night. he is your Max. he knows how much you love him. so spend his last days with him.that is all i can tell you"

Petloss,2rgze1,Jupichan,1 point,Tue Jan 6 02:43:08 2015 UTC,Looking at Cleo's pictures gave such instant clear understanding to your every word and description.  It was all there right in her magical eyes and beautiful face.  She was wonderful!  RIP Cleo
Petloss,2rgze1,tinyirishgirl,2,Tue Jan 6 12:59:11 2015 UTC,"She had gorgeous eyes.  Gorgeous, jade eyes that could instill terror in dogs four times her size.  Eyes that could say ""You're pretty alright, human."" with one look.  I still remember the day my dad brought her home.  I was twelve. My dad's boss had called my mom at work to tell her ""your husband has something he wants to ask you"".  (He didn't want to make the call himself 'cause he knew she would say yes.  He's the kind that ""doesn't know"" he wants an animal around until he's got them.)  He got as far as ""So, you see, there's this cat...""  ""Bring her home!""  The poor girl was dark grey.  And she HATED listening to Fox News Radio.  She whined and moaned the entire car trip home until my dad turned it off to make a phone call.  Then my dad brings her into the house.  She hops out of his arms and beelines for our beagle, Daisy.    POW!    Man, the look each of them gave me after that.  Daisy's said ""What the hell did I do?""  Cleo's said ""I'm the boss here now.""   And she was.  Then she went to sleep in my sock drawer for a day and a half."

Petloss,2qpeko,VanByNight,5,Mon Dec 29 12:05:33 2014 UTC,"i get it, and i know your pain of losing those precious souls.  i have lost a few over the last 15 years, and it NEVER gets easier, though the pain does turn to happy memories as time goes on.  i still cry over my first dog that i had for only 5 years, before he got suddenly ill, and passed unexpectedly overnite at the emergency vet.  it took a long time for me to stop blaming myself, and tried to put things into perspective.    after he died, i got another dog, and he is still here with me, and honestly the greatest thing to ever come along.  i, too, thought id never get another dog, but i did, and it was the best thing to happen.  last year, i lost another one of my little babies. her story sounds a lot like yours, except she didnt have cancer.  she had developed a spine/disc issue and couldnt walk either.  it was extremely heartbreaking, since she was so delicate and so sweet...to see her go through this pain was so wrong and so cruel...i hated the world for what was happening to her.  after realizing i couldnt let her suffer any longer, i, too, had to make that decision to take her in to end her pain, though my pain still lingers.  she was everything to me.  i still cry to this day over her (as im crying writing this!).    i know shes in a better place, just like i hope you know Josie is in a better place, not feeling any pain.  know that she came into your life for a reason, and you both learned from each other and thats the most beautiful gift.  she will never leave you, so know that as you talk to her and she can hear you.  so remember that.  and please dont  give up on getting another beautiful soul into your life, because there's nothing better than the pure love of an animal.  they really are gifts of love.    hang in there, cry your eyeballs out, but know that you are not alone and we understand your sorrow.  thank you for saving josie and i know she thanks you for the wonderful 6-7years you gave her!"

No matter what I do, or no matter what people say to comfort me, it doesn't help much. Crying with my family, who misses him just as much as I do, helps me cope a little, but the hurt is overwhelming at times. I am sorry Josie became sick in her final days, but you did so much for her and showed her a lot of love. I know she was happy being with you and your son despite her condition. I myself am wondering when the hurt will stop, so please know that I am pretty sure this is normal and you are certainly not alone in considering these animals as people.

Petloss,2qobkr,MaxDZ8,2,Mon Dec 29 15:35:05 2014 UTC,"I'm afraid you cannot just ""wake up"" a day and stop feeling pain. That's how it goes for us staying there.  However, realize you have not to regret being ""too late"". I've taken my little princess to the vet the other week, I'm being very lucky with her. The vet told me those kind of things take time and once past a certain point, they cannot really go back.  You acted as soon as you could, without hiding, without neglecting. You did the best you could, as soon as you could. I'm sorry she ran out of time. All the best."
Petloss,2qnvd3,stuck_at_starbucks,5,Mon Dec 29 00:29:05 2014 UTC,"I think patience is the only option here.  Unfortunately our 11 year old Great Dane is having the same problem.  He hasn't been able to control his elimination for months, and barely gets up to walk anywhere.  We just had to put our other Dane down at the beginning of November, he was 11 as well, but getting around much better than Rex. Unfortunately, my dad has been in denial about Rex for a long time, and my mom refuses to put another dog down by herself.  However, he decided a few days ago that it would be done after the holidays.  There really hasn't been any recent changes to Rex's behavior or mobility that would trigger a change of heart, it just took time.  You may want to try having your husband spend some significant alone time with him without you as a buffer.  I can't guarantee that anything but time will bring him around, but maybe additional time without you as a buffer or ""babying him (which my dad constantly accused us of),"" he will see how helpless he is.  I know this isn't an easy decision, and you don't take it lightly, so I'm incredibly sorry for your impending loss (and the current emotional turmoil). It is clear you love your canine friend and only want him not to suffer anymore. I wish you the best."

My brother brought his dog over and that has helped a lot. I know the decision to put him to was the right thing to do. We'll always have the memories."
Petloss,2qelca,edub3sw,2,Fri Dec 26 02:06:24 2014 UTC,"I am so sorry. It sounds like you did so much to make her last days comfortable. I know it may not help from hearing it, but you did the right thing. Dogs mask their pain so well, and we can only go off of what we see and feel. I had to put my baby girl down just over a month ago. It was very unexpected. I know the feeling of not wanting to be around family, or anyone for that matter. I completely shut everyone out for a few weeks. I am still struggling with it today.   Although I am a still a mess, I will share some of the things that I have been doing to help me with the grieving process. I haven't stuck to any of them, but I am trying. And although they help a bit, I am still balling my eyes out as I write this right now.   I picked one person, one of my closest friends, and didn't shut them out as much. I tried to talk about it with them and share how I felt. Getting it out with someone, and hearing what they have to say can help when you're ready. I also just started volunteering at a non profit, non-kill local shelter. I've done it once so far and plan to do it weekly. Even though it can be sad, it makes me miss Bailey, but I know I am helping the dogs and that is rewarding.   Exercise. I walk, jog. And that's about it, really. This is the one thing I know will help the most, but just do not want to go outside. I've started stretching, using foam rollers to try and loosen up.     I am actually going to see a therapist today for the first time. A lot of health insurance providers cover mental wellness. I have Kaiser and just need to pay a co-pay. If you would've asked me 3 months ago, if I would go to therapy for any reason, I would laugh. I don't like the idea of it for some reason, and always thought I was strong enough to not need it. But me and Bailey were close. She was my best friend and we shared an amazing bond. If I wasn't working, we would go everywhere together. When we were just at home, she would follow me around wherever. When we went walking on trails, she would always turn around to make sure I was behind her. Losing her has been too much, so I figured it was worth a shot and I do not want this depression to consume me.   I hope this didn't bum you out even further, but I wanted to share some of the things that I am doing to try and help with learning how to deal with the loss, and let you know that there are others out there that feel the exact same way as you do right now.   This was our last day together, we were at her favorite park.  http://i.imgur.com/7QgLPGD.jpg"

Petloss,2qepoz,susanshoos,2,Fri Dec 26 13:57:50 2014 UTC,She was! Not as tough as I thought it would be. I just stay focused on all the awesome years/times. Her final decline was gradual over the past year so I did have lots of time to prepare and say goodbye. Certainly not easy.

Petloss,2pzjlf,mrdangdang,3,Sun Dec 21 17:48:21 2014 UTC,"""A word on perspective and companionship: Many people will say, ""Hey, it's just a cat. Get over it."" To that all I can say is these two things: 1.) It's nobody's business to judge what others open their hearts to. We humans love the things we love. When the things that we love are gone, it breaks our heart. It's really that simple. 2.) There is no companionship in the world quite like the companionship of a pet."" You said it- my 2 yr old cat died last month, the Vet thinks that he had some kind of genetic disorder, and I am still not over it.     I am so sorry for your loss- whether you have a cat for 7 months or 7 years, they just do something to your life that cannot be replaced."

Petloss,2pudfq,erictism,3,Sat Dec 20 03:54:59 2014 UTC,I am so sorry for this time of sadness for you and dearest Sonny.  Holding him if it does not make him hurt or uncomfortable and softly talk to him about your love for him.  You might talk about things that you did together and remember the sweet moments you shared with each other.  You might think about what you would like him to do for you if things were reversed.  Soft words and loving hands.  Keeping you and precious Sonny in my thoughts.
Petloss,2pudfq,tinyirishgirl,1 point,Sat Dec 20 01:53:41 2014 UTC,Maybe you should take him to the vet to be put to sleep. I know it is hard but might be the kindest thing to do.
Petloss,2pudfq,tammyetter,1 point,Sat Dec 20 13:41:31 2014 UTC,"He doesn't seem sick or in pain, so I'd rather let him pass in his sleep, comfortable and safe at home. He's terrified of the vet and I'd rather his last moments not be frightening."

I feel horrible for you, and every time I hear such as story I can not help but tear up a little bit. It doesn't get any easier now matter how many times I hear about this exact thing happening so many times.  Hopefully, people will realize that dogs needs a dog-specific fence that prevents predators (like coyotes, or other dogs) from getting into your yard - especially if you leave your dog out for any period of time when you are not there.

Perhaps you can focus on the happiness that she did have, that right up until her untimely end things were great. One way I have coped is to gather my surviving pets in my arm and hold them until I can face life again. My hope is that you can soon start to heal. PM me if you need to talk some more."

Petloss,2pswos,Christof3,1 point,Fri Dec 19 22:19:32 2014 UTC,"I'm so so sorry for your loss. Much love and condolences. It's so very difficult to lose a member of the family, and especially at such a young age. My wife and I lost our 5 year old Morkie to IMHA 3 weeks ago, and I know she is still feeling very much the way you are. We had plans to incorporate our little guy into our announcement when we finally conceive, and knew he would make the most amazing big brother. Try to find comfort in the knowledge that you gave your baby an incredibly loving home, and be certain that she knew how much she was loved. It will hurt like hell for now, but someday you'll be looking back at those memories and smiling at how amazing of a companion she was. Grieving is a hard thing, and for some people it will be harder and take longer than for others, so don't let anyone make you feel like you should be rushing to move on. Take the time that you need to heal and keep letting the new pup make you smile. Like others have offered, you can PM me if you ever feel like you need to talk to someone about it."
Petloss,2ps3dp,iamequipoised,6,Fri Dec 19 11:36:00 2014 UTC,"look accidents happen. uit ws just an accident, they didnt mean to let the dog loose, it didnt mean to run in front of your husband's car, you husband didnt mean to hit it, he was already in an invasive maneuver to avoid the cat, he did the decent thing and stuck around.  i know a young couple, a lovely couple, she's always been dog mad, they are just married and they got their first dog, a golden lab. one even while walking it, it got tanlgled up with another dog, in it's excitement as they tried to untangle the two it bolted, into the road and under a car (it died eventually, she wanted to save it but it was too damaged), anyway the driver got out of the car and started admonishing them for being careless and having an unruly dog and threatening them with costs if any damage was done to the car, your husband could have pulled that shit, it's the dog owner's fault (legally) when a dog is hit in the road, hopefuly in your case the dog owners realise it was an accident, unfortunate but they happen.  he's been through a trauma, just comfort him, he's at no fault. maybe make a donation or do something nice for a charity if it helps  (this reminds me, i was once the passenger in a car that hit an owl. it looked badly hurt and i put it out of its misery, even though i wasnt driving it's been a burden to me for years, maybe it could have survived had i take it to a vet, i dont know, i joined and contribute to bird watch ireland to at least help in making amends, it helps a little)"

I hit a squirl once  I flipped my shit and almost crashed the car afterward. I wanted to bary it. I couldn't .it was to buisy a road for me to get to him. I bought a totum. a carving of a squirl.it sits beside my computer to remind me of the little squirl. it makes me feel better. this is not for everyone. but I thought I would at least tell you.

Question: In the picture, she looks like a puggle to you? I always thought she was, but we don't know for sure."
Petloss,2pmgf8,Oesterreichk,4,Wed Dec 17 22:50:59 2014 UTC,Beautiful loving KiKi decided your family was her family and then she chose you to lavish all her extra love on.    Her pictures are so lovable I can almost hear the sound of her purring.  You gave each other two years of kindness and joy and trust.  You gifted each other with forever love.  Keeping you and KiKi in my heart and thoughts.  RIP KiKi

Petloss,2pmgf8,Accentnails,2,Thu Dec 18 22:17:59 2014 UTC,What a beautiful girl!  I am so very sorry for your loss.  It doesn't make sense when it happens suddenly and they're so young.  Take care of yourself and know that she is with you in your heart.

There has been Near-death experiences of people seeing their deceased pets & also NDEs of Norse (viking mythology)nature although few are reported & they(vikings)actually believed in the Bifrost,a rainbow bridge to Valhalla which,by the way, was visited by a now ex athiest after his NDE among other Paradises & afterlife realms.Anyway,in body & as a bodily being(but not without the faith part),I am compelled to tell you that,you must acknowledge that he is the kitty of your childhood & his death won't change that ! Walk your life worthy of his memory,carrying him in your heart for the rest of your material,efimerous life ! for now R.I.P. kitty =( Reddit love now & forever kitty ."

Petloss,2pm7dp,Accentnails,2,Thu Dec 18 11:03:38 2014 UTC,"I very much believe in something after our physical life and it was very lovely to read about all of the possibilities so thank you for your comment :) Jesse will have passed over by now, I will be waiting for him to come visit me. Again, thank you."

Anyway,I would think that your destiny as a soul is to live in that same way when you are there and you will be with Jesse James forever.Just don't overlook the miracle of living,of being alive today as you walk your path of life worthy of who you were (and still are) to your special kitty Jesse James special person,for that is worthy of his memory from this plane point of view knowing in your heart your Eternal future with him =D"
