universe,2bwypc,Master712,2,Mon Jul 28 04:02:31 2014 UTC,"I'm a carpenter who likes to think about this kind of stuff, by no means an expert.  The first statement that jumped out at me was the idea that the universe must be infinite because there would be a boundary, and the article argued that simply couldn't be.  But that assumes euclidean geometry.  If the universe had spherical geometry, for example, you could travel in a straight line and you'd eventually end up back at your starting location.  While I realize that all data so far points to a ""flat"", euclidean universe, it's easy to be deceived into believing its flat because we only see such a small segment of the universe (sort of how we thought the world was flat based on geometry, until we see the world as a larger sphere over greater distances).    The concept of infinity also negates chance entirely.  If something happens once, no matter how tiny the odds, it will happen again.  Not once, not twice, but an infinite number of times.  Which means I exist in this universe an infinite number of times.  I'm writing this exact post an infinite number of times right now inside this very universe.  Every possible variation of my life is played out an infinite number of times.  Literally, everything you can imagine is real somewhere in our universe, and exists in an infinite number.  And it's most likely that the truth is something we will never comprehend.  I just am not sure I can buy into an infinite universe scenario.  If only because I don't want to admit that as individuals, we're infinitely common."

universe,1r5oia,texanman000,7,Thu Nov 21 18:57:02 2013 UTC,"So, I want you to imagine if your two-dimensional piece of paper was actually curved in the third-dimension so that it looked like a ball.  The two-dimensional creatures that live in it can only look up-down and left-right, but not out-in, and have no idea that their universe is curved until they go far enough in any direction and end up back where they started.  What's to say that our three-dimensional universe is not curved in a similar way in the fourth dimension such that, while it is finite and expanding, there is no edge?"
universe,1r5oia,King_grif20,4,Thu Nov 21 23:17:35 2013 UTC,Some say that we are in the 4th dimension because of 3 dimensional space + time. So maybe you would pop into the fifth dimension where you can also move through time not only forward and back but side to side through timelines.
universe,1r5oia,effymushroom,2,Sat Dec 7 00:12:07 2013 UTC,This is what i was thinking however we are already moving through time but at our own perception of a constant of it. So we are moving in one direction through the 4th dimension (time) and are limited buy our movement around the third dimension (space) as to the speed of time and direction of it. Brian cox's talk on the science of doctor who describes this nicely. This would suggest that IF we were to pass through to a 5th dimension we could alter our movement around time.

If you looked in all directions and only saw things moving away from you? Would there be anything special at the center of our Universe?
