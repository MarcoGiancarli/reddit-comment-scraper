But then why use them as the poster boys for horrible things that we must drag women through so that they can finally earn respect? It makes no sense.

I'm laying on the couch with my brothers laptop for a hour doing a time sensitive java project due by midnight. My younger cousins (5,7,9) are running around me while their parents are in the room.    Fine so far.   A hour goes by and there's kicked over juice cups, a broken toy. one child screaming Living room is now a mess. I ask the 9 year old to get the mop and clean up his spilled juice.   I don't see why she has to ask him to clean up his spilled juice, especially when she's working on a time sensitive project due later that night, but nothing really weird yet.   He throws a glass cup at me and it shatters on the floor. I move all kids to one side of the room. I scolded him with trying to get him to stand in a corner. He kicks me. I smash his toy.   Nothing wrong with the story here, but breaking his stuff was uncalled for.   Another child screaming By this time parents come out to access the scene.   Here's where it starts getting weird. How can they come out (in?) to ""access"" (probably assess) the scene when they were already in the room?   The first questions aren't: 1. Are my children okay 2. Is anyone hurt 3. Why is their glass on the floor Its immediately making me responsible for cleaning up the mess of their children I wasn't asked to watch.   Now this I really don't understand, why would they need to ask all those things if they were in the room the whole time? But I think what's being said here is that they didn't ask those questions but (in the author's mind) were supposed to. So then they say that she needs to clean up the mess through a question? I really have no clue. Is it even the parents saying that?   I was called irresponsible, lazy and all around a waste of space. I sat back down on the couch while they cleaned up the mess and bonus insult: '' You're so dirty, I would never come to your house because you don't clean anything''   Now in the comments she says this all happened when they visited her place. So didn't they already come to her house? Unless this is the kids saying that because they probably didn't have much say in the matter but that's kinda debunked by the next line. Also, who's cleaning up the mess? The parents? The kids? Didn't she just say that she was supposed to?

circlebroke2,3dvxgv,Bilgistic,16,Mon Jul 20 01:06:53 2015 UTC,"Right? I'm 27 and single with no kids. My roommates are 30 and 31. Both single and no kids. One or two of my friends in town have kids. And if you go back to college friends, there are two or three more.  I live in a bigger city, which obviously shifts the demographics. But even in my small hometown, the vast majority of people are kidless. Is there a huge, hidden social group of twenty-something parents that we haven't been invited to?"
circlebroke2,3dvxgv,thernkworks,5,Mon Jul 20 01:31:06 2015 UTC,"You're friends mostly not having kids is not a surprise really.  People tend to drift away from their single-no-kids friends once they have kids.  It's like 2 different clubs, parents and non's.  Different schedules and different priorities mostly.  Anyways, I wouldn't take your experiences now as reflective of society in general.  There's still a lot of parents 25-30"

circlebroke2,3dvxgv,thernkworks,4,Mon Jul 20 03:37:20 2015 UTC,"They have like 3 people on their Facebook friends list that settled down and had kids. That means everyone, okay?   But seriously. A lot of late 20's, early 30's friends here. Many have settled down, and just as many have not."

Sometimes things people say make it hard not to prejudge, despite knowing it's wrong.  This is where a lot of social mores and what not come from, and I was specifically just saying how this was breaking a more that I thought was in place.  Clearly not on internet forums.  So when the only thing I know about you is that you're the only one of your friends/family that hasn't gotten a girlfriend while the rest are having children, then that thought just pops into my head; Just for a second.    I thought it was weird so many people users were loudly proclaiming it.  I know why they were, I get how internet works, but it's just a weird thing to jerk about, something you wouldn't really see in real life, IMHO.  Again, just an observation and thought I had.  I wasn't trying to smugly jerk about it, although, this is CB2 so I can see how everyone assumed the worst o.O  *grammerz"

Rachel Dolezal appears to be in the middle. Probably CT's attempt to highlight that any person who fights for minority rights must be self-hating or something. Also probably to show they hate the ""trannies"" because ""RACE AND GENDER ARE BIOLOGY AND BASED IN GLORIOUS STEM AND ALL THOSE SOCIOLOGISTS AND FEMINISTS ARE WRONG AND LITERALLY HITLER (but not actually Hitler because he was cool)"" Albums highlighting black artists and Queen. Queen is just there because We are the Champions. Either that or because it's known that Freddie Mercury died of AIDS complications, and of course, to a CT member, ""AIDS = GAYS AND BLACK PEOPLE DEAD YAY!"" I don't know about anyone else other than MC Hammer :| Some black woman on the right along with ""we dindu nuffin."" I'm guessing just stereotypical black woman, the ""Sapphire"" stereotype who claims to be a ""Strong Black Woman Who Don't Need No Man"" or some shit. And of course, ""dindu nuffin"" because CT loves to claim black people constantly absolve themselves for being apparently inherently criminals.   tl;dr: The new banner is just another expression of their viewpoints without actually having to go through their sub and read their shit.  edit: I don't know what the baby is about."
