bloomington,3dr82p,mcjessica,4,Sat Jul 18 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"I went to Childs Elementary from K-3 and then 5-6.  This was in the 90s and maybe things have changed since then, but I certainly am happy to share my experience with you nonetheless.  I always excelled in school and liked being challenged so when my family found out about the ALPS program it sounded like a great idea.  I switched to ALPS at University Elementary in 4th Grade.  It was a terrible mistake.  I used to like school and loved Childs, however I quickly grew to hate school during my year at University Elementary.  For one thing, the level of arrogance there was laughable.  There were quite a few people involved in the ALPS program (parents mostly, some of the administrators, and a lot of the kids) who made it clear they were obviously ""superior"" by being a part of ALPS.  This also, of course, led to a constant battle of one-upping.  You could ignore it but it was still an annoyance.  The schoolwork itself was ridiculous.  I did well enough with my grades and what not in 4th Grade, but I had to put HOURS of work in.  It wasn't so much that it was ""too hard"" but, instead, it was the amount of mindless busy work and dumb ""projects"" we had to do that was staggering.  I felt like I lost a lot of time to just be a kid.  One other downside to University was that all of the kids in my neighborhood still went to Childs, so now all of my friends went to another school.  It's a little different for your son since he's new in town, I suppose, but it'll still be a pain going to a school on the far northeast edge of the city limits while living on the south side.  After a year, I felt like I got nothing special out of ALPS and my parents agreed.  I asked to go back to Childs in 5th Grade, and couldn't have been happier to return.  I got a great education at Childs that prepared me to go on and succeed in middle and high school (Jackson Creek and South, for what it's worth).  I ultimately attended IU and graduated with a 4.0.  I attribute a lot of my academic success to my time at Childs and the foundation built there.  I think your son can and will get a great education there that will prepare him for his future, too.  You don't need ALPS.  Childs has great teachers and a solid history.  There's a reason it constantly wins all the awards.    I suppose for some of the schools in MCCSC that aren't as strong as Childs, ALPS might be a step up.  I wonder if ALPS might offer a better chance for academic success for a young ""gifted and talented"" Fairview student.  I don't mean to trash Fairview Elementary because I'm sure there are plenty of wonderful people there, but it always ranks dead last of all the local schools.  Getting out of that environment might be beneficial.  Thankfully that won't be a problem for your son.  Your family is lucky to be in the Childs district."
bloomington,3dr82p,alpssucks,4,Sat Jul 18 20:36:59 2015 UTC,"I just want to echo whatever this guy/girl said.  I also did ALPS in the 90's and went to Childs/Jackson Creek/South and IU.    The homework was not too hard, but it was very time consuming.  You had to do a lot of projects, such as building dioramas or cooking African dishes for the entire class.  I would have rather just read books or write papers and not dealt with all that BS.  Going to middle school was a relief after that, and I had much more free time.  It wasn't uncommon for students to call out sick the next day to work on their projects or for parents to have to help out or go buy special supplies.  I'd like to second the arrogance element that this poster mentioned. It's not a particular healthy or useful attitude for a bunch of elementary school students to have. Our teacher at the time actually told us directly about how much better we were than the other classes at the school.  Of course, this did nothing to help us become popular with them.  Some of the students were very competitive and would throw temper tantrums because of stuff like losing a spelling bee."
bloomington,3dr82p,alpsthrowaway,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:29:43 2015 UTC,"Time-consuming homework would probably backfire a lot with my kid.

Your experiences are exactly what I was hoping to avoid... my hope is that maybe things have changed since you were in the program. We are meeting with the ALPS coordinator next week to discuss placement (at this point, we don't even know for sure that our son is even eligible for the program). We live so close to Childs (less than 1/2 mile) that it would be a shame to have to drive across town, especially if it's for a not-so-great experience."
bloomington,3dr82p,werefuckingformals,2,Sat Jul 18 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"I was a ALPS student at University Elementary for 5th and 6th grades.  Honestly I think it's a very worthwhile program to give your child a well rounded education.  It gives your kid plenty of opportunities to explore areas of study, but this comes with a bit of a cost.  Basically you need to have a motivated child, certainly being bright helps, but there is an expectation for detailed work in almost every field."
bloomington,3dr82p,bad_wolff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:37:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this... the ""expectation for detailed work"" is what scares me a little. On the other hand, maybe what my son really needs is more of a challenge/kick in the pants. He (like me) tends to be lazy and take the easy way a lot of times. Way back when I was in a gifted program, it was much more lackadaisical and I got away with not doing a lot of homework."
bloomington,3dr82p,theundeadelvis,2,Sat Jul 18 23:14:50 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I was in ALPS from 4th (first year) to 8th (last) grade, and all in all I found it a very worthwhile experience. I changed schools a couple times due to redistricting beforehand, so I don't feel I left behind any cohesive friend groups. This is a complaint I have heard from those who didn't like it.   TL;DR: ALPS was extremely worthwhile academically and quite so socially. Sorry for the wall of text. I really like to be thorough.  Socially:  I think the social experience was lovely. There were maybe seven of us that went from University to Jackson Creek, and I've known most of them from 3rd grade. I really feel like I grew up with my classmates, and when I left South for junior year, not knowing I would be back for senior year, I lamented that I would never see these people again. Even though we weren't all of us close, I feel that knowing them and having that kind of connection to my early youth is extremely great. They're one of very few things I missed when I left MCCSC, and they're some of very few people I remember even though I grew away from them in high school. To be fair, I was bullied in sixth grade, but I attribute this not to being in ALPS but instead to being clumsy, unathletic, and not great at handling actively unkind people.   Academically:  I was at Binford for 3rd grade for context. Academically I think elementary ALPS was quite worthwhile. It enabled me to progress far ahead in math (I took university linear algebra in 11th grade), and my English education was fabulous. We were writing research papers starting in fourth grade, and all the major ideas of formal writing and grammar I knew by the end of sixth. Honestly no English grammar/writing class has stood up to my elementary ALPS education as well as relentless reading effectively until junior year. Perhaps I'm an outlier, but I genuinely think that I got a lot out of ALPS in elementary school and especially in sixth grade that I wouldn't have gotten anywhere else. I learned valuable learning skills, I learned to think creatively and analytically, I learned to actually Google things correctly and efficiently (I know this sounds trivial, but honestly looking at my peers, it's a special gift), and I learned through the annual research projects to narrow down ideas of interest into narrow and relevant topics. Obviously, this is invaluable for any form of academic writing, but I also think it's a useful skill to have for day to day thought.  In summation, I am extremely glad I was in elementary ALPS. Middle school ALPS at Jackson Creek was pretty meh, but the elementary experience was really great for me. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. I would imagine I have the most recent view here, unless this sub is populated by teenagers :).   Edit: I should add that my English experience is wholly due to my teachers. Ms. Piekarski is there I think still, and she was pretty good, but Ms. Cerwinski was absolutely fabulous and probably the greatest contribution to my intellectual and academic growth until high school. Ms. Coake sucked from a humanities standpoint, but with her we did a lot of hands on STEM things.    Also, some people have spoken about homework. I don't remember that much, but there was some. However, save for some of the sixth grade history stuff, I think it was all stimulating and worthwhile. Very little busy work. Discussion with parental figure confirms that there was some homework but that it wasn't too bad. Fourth grade we read a lot which was great, and I recall a few science and engineering based projects in fifth grade that were mostly in class. For example, we designed and built model roller coasters, learned about simple machines, and competed to build the best environmentally efficient house in terms of heating (it was super easy. My group won :D).   I also didn't really notice anything like what another poster said about arrogance and temper tantrums until middle school. There were no temper tantrums ever, and arrogance was not an issue. We all socialized with people outside of ALPS, and while those of us who were in elementary ALPS did view ourselves as better than those who entered ALPS in  middle school, it never caused any problems. In elementary, we weren't well integrated into the normal classes except during gym and music class. In recess, most of us played by ourselves. The teachers certainly never told us we were better than the other classes.   I also attended Childs, though I was at Binford in 3rd. I think my ALPS experience was better. Further, all my high school friends came from Childs, and I had a much better education than they did coming into middle school."

It sounds like your experience was overall much more positive than some of the others from the 90s or so.  I do think my son wants (and needs) a challenge. We are meeting with the ALPS coordinator next week and will need to make a decision then (assuming he's offered a spot at all) about his placement in the program. It's such a hard decision to make! If he does go into ALPS, he'll essentially repeat the 4th grade, so he's back among his age-level peers. We think that will probably be best for him. I may have some more questions but have been caring for a fussy baby all day so have a bit of baby fuzz brain."
bloomington,3dr82p,theundeadelvis,0,Sat Jul 18 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"I was in ALPS at University and then at Tri-North in the early-mid 2000s. I had a terrific experience. Mrs. Piekarsky is the only teacher I had who is still there (it's a shame Mrs. Kinkead isn't teaching alps anymore as she was among the best teachers I've had at any level), so I can't speak that much to the teachers there now. I enjoyed 4th grade with Mrs. Piekarsky, though fifth and sixth grade were better. However, I would still very strongly recommend the program. I made friends in ALPS in fourth grade who I'm still close with now, nearly 15 years later, and I think a lot of former ALPS students would have had similar experiences. I think elementary school ALPS really challenged us, but not in a bad way at all. We had to read a lot, but I think that was a really good thing for me--better that I had to read for an hour every night than that I would have sat in front of the TV or whatever else I might have done. I certainly remember dragging my parents to the library the night before a project was due on a handful of occasions, but not too often. However, they did give us real grades and they were dependent on how hard you worked, which displeased some of the parents and lead to a lot of parent-teacher-administration conflict while I was there. Hopefully that's all settled down by now--I think there's a new principal there who is much better than the old one was.  Really I think if your son is smart and wants to be around other smart children, ALPS would be a good environment for him. I don't think it turned me into a snob, or any more so than I would have been otherwise. I don't remember any competitiveness or temper tantrums like one of the other posters mentioned. ALPS was certainly the best place I could have been socially--I really struggled to relate to a lot of kids my age as a nerdy, unathletic, somewhat effeminate boy, but I definitely did a lot better in ALPS and made a lot of lasting friendships. And pretty much all of the kids in my elementary school ALPS class went on to success in college and beyond, so there has to be something to it."

But I don't have any fellow crossdressers in my social circle (at least, not that I know of). As best I can tell, there don't seem to be any crossdressing groups/meetups here in Bloomington, and I've also not come up with any good ideas for how to meet other local crossdressers. I'm semi-active on /r/crossdressing, and less so on crossdressers.com, but making local connections has eluded me.  Do you venture out of the house dressed? Is that something that interests you? (I haven't—yet—but would like to under the right circumstances.)

So, for whatever it's worth, as far as integrating crossdressing into your social life is concerned, I say don't let concerns about passing be a hindrance to that.  What board games are you into? We only own a couple—Settlers and Ticket to Ride—and have friends who own a few others that we therefore get to play mostly whenever we want, but I know there's a whole world of games out there to try!"

bloomington,3dna49,hamfriend,2,Fri Jul 17 18:55:22 2015 UTC,"/u/Girl_Named_Sandoz already mentioned both Student Legal Services and Indiana Legal Services.  SLS is out since you're not a student.  ILS has income guidelines based on funding restrictions (it's complicated) but generally they help folks at or around the poverty level.  That said, they generally reserve resources for more desperate situations, like evictions, or where a landlord is seeking damages above and beyond the deposit.    Anecdotally, SLS and ILS usually don't try to go after nabbed deposits.  Indiana is pretty bad for tenants, and landlords are a substantial part of the Bloomington tax base, with the perception that students are transient residents who don't vote in judicial elections.  But there is one resource where you can at least get some advice, assuming you're in town now- District 10/H Pro Bono Project runs a free walk-in legal advice clinic in the Justice Building (701 N. College, big building where all the courts are) every Friday.  Their afternoon session, from 1:30-3:30, is the consumer/housing/collection law time.  They do not offer full representation, but you get to sit down with an attorney, get advice, they'll fill out pro se forms for you, get you set up with how to file if in fact there is anything you can do.  I would take a copy of your lease, as well as a copy of the check they sent.  Be certain to take the envelope (which should be postmarked with the date they sent it) as well as the itemized list of cleaning/repairs.  The lawyer at the clinic can tell you whether or not there's anything to be done.  Edit: I'm mostly certain that ILS does not pursue withheld damage deposits, given that their intake screening is substantially similar to other IOLTA-funded programs, which further pares down cases precluded by LSC restrictions.  My knowledge of what cases SLS takes or doesn't take comes from what an SLS attorney who sometimes volunteers for legal clinics told me."

Any maintenance issue is fixed immediately, the staff is really nice and helpful and I haven't heard of anyone being over charged on move outs. Other people I know who are in Regency buildings have had good experiences. My building and others they have (like Fountain Park that someone mentioned) are also pet friendly--even for large dogs. A lot of graduate students (like me) and young families and professionals live there so it's not noisy and full of parties.  Also, to give you an idea I pay $642 for a pretty large one bedroom (it even has a little dining area) with water and pet rent included. Electricity and internet/cable are separate with electricity ranging from $24-100 depending on the time of year. That seems fairly average from what I've heard for the area.  As for things to do, Bloomington has quite a bit for such a small town. I've not been here super long, but the music and art school have a ton of productions they put on which are great. If you like stand up, there's the Comedy Attic. The bars are pretty good, but probably not as varied as what you're used to coming from Chicago. The Lily Library at IU has a really, really cool collection of rare books and other things that are interesting. The food is pretty good! There's quite a bit of variety and new places opening up. And there's also tons of lakes and hiking trails just outside of Bloomington. If you're in to rocks and fossils I can make more suggestions for where to collect and see some cool things (I'm a Geology grad student so rocks and fossils are sort of my thing).

bloomington,3db60m,Dieselfred,5,Wed Jul 15 01:08:09 2015 UTC,I went to Centerbrook a lot growing up and it's fine. Starlite has nicer bathrooms and a wider food selection (at least as of last year it did. Haven't been this year yet.) And if you're driving from Bloomington Starlite is closer. I think the picture and sound quality are about the same.
bloomington,3db60m,whiskey_and_wine,3,Wed Jul 15 05:27:48 2015 UTC,"I was at the Starlite a couple weeks ago for the first time and I had a good time! There's a ton of room so you can spread out and not be right next to another car. The food they had was good! You probably know this, but you listen to the audio through your car's radio and if you have a newer car with a touch screen it may not be super thrilled about discharging the battery for that long. My car started beeping like every 5 minutes which was pretty annoying, but you can bring a cheap stand-alone radio and keep the car totally off!"

bloomington,3db60m,kultakala,2,Tue Jul 14 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"I've been to both, and have had good experiences at both.  The Starlite is closer, and has a wide variety of food options - many from local businesses!  (Swing-In Pizza, Chocolate Moose ice cream, Naughty Dog hot dogs, to name a few).  They take cash and plastic at the gate and concessions.  The Centerbrook is a little further, but still a cool destination.  Instead of just a field in front for playing, they have a field with a playground.  Old school swings and a slide made out of actual metal.  The concessions are more ""traditional"" - that is, typical concession stand kind of food - but still tasty and reasonably priced.  They only take cash at the gate.  The only thing that bugs me about the Starlite is the constant harping on outside food, this past year.  Yes! We get it! You make your money on concessions!  I definitely don't want the place to close - it's such a treasure.  But, I'd much rather support a crowdfunding project for the new projector than get lectured every time I go.  I'm going to buy stuff at the concession stand, anyway, but sometimes I might like to augment that with some baked treats from home, or something.  Both show old intermission cartoons in between features.  When I go, I love to get there early, park down front, and set up camp.  Blankets, chairs, a small table, games, bocce ball..."

bloomington,3d7kwz,Daedalistic-Outlook,3,Tue Jul 14 04:27:25 2015 UTC,"Heat lightning:       Heat lightning is the name used for the faint flashes of lightning on the horizon or other clouds from distant thunderstorms that do not have accompanying sounds of thunder. This happens because the lightning occurs very far away and the sound dissipates before it reaches the observer.  The term is a little misleading because it has nothing to do with the heat of the lightning itself. At night, it is possible to see the flashes of lightning from very far distances, up to 100 miles, but the sound doesn't carry that far.  Lightning results from the discharge of negative ions created from the friction of ice and water particles bumping into each other at the bottom of a cloud. Heat lightning can be an early warning sign that thunderstorms are approaching. In Florida, heat lightning is often seen out over the water at night, the remnants of storms that formed during the day along a sea breeze front coming in from the opposite coast.

If that is true, then I am genuinely sorry that some person, who self-identified as a hipster, has made you feel so hurt at some point in your life.  However, the original post was an IU Police report.  It was posted because the OP expressed concern that an identical incident happened to them, and that it happened with an individual who matched the physical description provided in the report.  The OP then appealed to the community at large, curious if anyone else had experienced the same.  It is true that the OP made the comparison and appeal in a separate post, instead of the original submission.  But the issue of hipster branding was still never a criminal concern for the Original Poster.  If you think it would be helpful to the community, a thread can be opened concerning hipsters, both in Bloomington and everywhere else.  I am especially up for it if you would find the experience to be at all therapeutic.  But I also feel like I should warn you that I'm sure that human beings of any given stereotype would love the attention.  tl;dr -- So what you're saying is that you can't help the OP, since you yourself have not experienced a similar incident like reported by the police, and which also involved a person who matches the physical statistics given, correct?"

A Kryptolok series 2 or higher, or a good Abus lock is nearly impervious to human attack with 30"" bolt cutters, unless they are pneumatically driven or the person is very large and very strong.  Here is a series 4 kryptolok being worked on for 2 minutes:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMXO1cS5J0U  Maybe, maaaayyybe, if they had much larger, better quality bolt cutters they could bust a series 2 with two people working on it for a while, but series 3 and up is pretty much impossible. Kryptonite New York locks are standard bolt cutter impervious, under human only strength.   Abus locks are made to an even far higher standard, and although the really good ones (European rated - they are much stronger, and much more $$$) are not commonly available in the U.S., they are not only impenetrable by bolt cutters, but even cutoff wheel resistant except for only the very best quality, very high speed cutoff wheel tool setups. I believe they are made from AR600 grade steel and very thick. They are EXTREMELY strong.  Even Kryptonite's New York locks can withstand a long, sustained attack with a high quality cutoff wheel and a good quality grinder. And BOTH sides have to be cut, generally, to get a bike that is properly locked, out. So multiple a single cut time by 2 to get the real ""theft rate speed"".  http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Bike-Locks-Reviews/Kryptonite-New-York-Fahgettaboudit-U-Lock-Mini  More examples:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMBpUrGdWng  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eNI_SH29w8  Those videos are only of mid-grade U-Locks.

bloomington,3cy6y8,ribbondino,5,Sat Jul 11 22:14:56 2015 UTC,I live in MeadowCreek. Unfortunately I'm moving at the end of the month :( I love RR. I've had nothing but amazing experiences with them and I'm seriously upset to go.
bloomington,3cy6y8,khwerner5,3,Sun Jul 12 11:07:05 2015 UTC,"I lived at Covenanter Hill for a year. Loved it,  but hated my roommate, so I left.  I regret not just transferring to the other side of the community. Great place to live,  helped me out of an awful situation with my roommate when they didn't have to,  and they did it while maintaining a respectful and positive interaction for all parties. Plus, fancy Kroger is a 5 minute walk away.  What's not to like?"
bloomington,3cy6y8,Sf4251,2,Mon Jul 13 03:11:11 2015 UTC,Lived in Covenanter hill for 3 years while at iu. Buildings are older than some of the other complexes but anytime I submitted a maintenance request they were there within 24-48hrs and actually fixed the problems. They were the one apartment complex that didn't cheat me out of my deposit either. (Lived in 4 other apartments while in school and didn't get any back from those). Not sure if its still like this but Covenanter was always pretty quiet compared to other complexes during little 5 which was nice. One year nobody but me and my roommate were at the pool on Saturday. Ended up leaving to go to a friends in campus corner later in the evening.
bloomington,3cy6y8,Daedalistic-Outlook,3,Sun Jul 12 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"Ended up leaving because... a raccoon jumped into the pool, grossing you out?  An origami crane flew by under its own power, and you had to tell your friends in campus corner?  Or was a pool with only two people too quiet and lonely, so more friends were necessary?  Don't leave me hanging here!"

They did a fairly shit job. The dress was specifically picked because it had pockets. Without asking they removed the pockets when they did the alteration. They also didn't cut the liner inside so it was bunched up and didn't look quite right. So my suggestion would be not that place.

Also send maple syrup back, because that stuff is ungodly expensive in Europe and dirt cheap over here.  It's hard to come up with enough things that are uniquely Bloomington though.  The only thing Bloomington has that makes it unique really is IU, and IU-branded junk only goes so far.

bloomington,3clozy,clamps12345,4,Wed Jul 8 22:55:20 2015 UTC,"Depending on your income, you might be able to get access to free legal services.  /u/ohehyhaaaley identified Student Legal, which is pretty good with housing stuff given that housing is one of the common problems for students.  If you're within the income guidelines, there's also District 10 Pro Bono and Indiana Legal Services.  But if you're moving because of a job (that's lucrative enough to move out of state for) chances are good you make too much money for either service.  7 months of rent (assuming at least $400) is potentially $2800 in liability, which is probably enough to consider hiring a private attorney.  Plus, hiring a good attorney will take care of this business more promptly, allowing you to get on to your job.  Shopping for an attorney can be difficult, and it's always helpful to know more about your situation when you're shopping, and potentially even get a recommendation for a good attorney from another attorney.  To that end, you should check out Counsel In The Court, which is a walk-in, free brief advice clinic run by volunteer attorneys every Friday at the Monroe County Justice Building.  Consumer/Collections/Housing law is handled in the afternoons, 1:30-3:30.  They usually have two volunteer attorneys, and it's first-come first-serve, so I would suggest bringing all of your documents, coming early, and being ready to wait for a minute.  Then you get to sit down, get spot advice from an attorney, and they can help you either draft forms and give you enough information to handle things, or point you to a colleague."

You've taught me a new personal rule for the internet:   Avoid seeking legal advice from the internet.  Instead, ask the internet how to best seek legal advice in real life."
bloomington,3clozy,Daedalistic-Outlook,2,Sat Jul 11 20:34:00 2015 UTC,"Some of it is unauthorized practice of law.  There are a lot of people on the internet ready to offer up an opinion about something that might cause serious problems for somebody if followed.  Laypersons with some good information can be even more dangerous, because they come across as more credible, but still may be seriously mistaken if they don't actively practice law in a jurisdiction- they don't know the judges, they don't know the customs, they don't know the caselaw.  Working in low-income legal services, you see a lot of pro se (unrepresented) litigants, and you see exactly where that gets them.  If I had my druthers, everybody would have Gideon rights (right to free counsel if you can't afford a lawyer) for civil as well as criminal issues, at least for stuff that is near and dear, like kids, house, job, etc.  Right now, low income legal services programs serve about 1 out of every 8000 people who are eligible and in need.  Maximizing the number of people who at least know that these services are available is an incremental attempt to chip away a little at that 8000 number.  Anyway, in situations where you have something to lose, getting advice from a licensed attorney is as important as getting advice from a licensed physician.  Too bad both markets are so crazy expensive that they've priced out consumers."

And I think that the concentration of African American families on the near east side had a lot to do with the location of the old segregated school there on the corner of 6th and Washington, along with efforts by white neighborhood associations to quietly uphold unspoken land covenants.

bloomington,3c9jju,ZogoRanger,13,Mon Jul 6 03:53:15 2015 UTC,"If I was in town Id come look for a beer or two.   Diagnosing a non starting car falls into two categories: simple or complex.   In order for an engine to start and run you need four primary things: air, fuel, spark, and compression. These are the first four things you can check. Of these the first and easiest to look into are spark and compression.   Compression: Does the car crank at all? As in, when you go to start it, can you hear the starter motor whine? If no... Your battery is either dead or not connected to the electrical system or your starter is shot. Without a starter, you get no compression. If you can hear it whine, but it doesn't fire, then there's a small chance the seals on your piston are bad and you have a compression loss in the cylinders. but, it's  highly unlikely all cylinders would be out of compression... so move on.   Spark: spark plugs can be shot or dirty. The connections from the ignition coils can be loose or dirty. Clean up your connections, check the wires, and carefully pull out your plugs and inspect them. If you aren't knowledgeable able electrical systems or cars, don't try to check their spark--you'll risk hurting yourself or the car. Just clean or replace them as necessary.   From there it's a little more advanced. Is your car carb run or injected. Is the carb clean, are the injectors clean (is the engine getting fuel). Is the line cut from the tank. Is the tank fueled. Is the fuel pump working. Is your gas fresh and clean. Old gas is bad.   Is your air filter clean, is your carb or intake clean, is your throttle body functioning.  From the mechanical parts we go into ECU and computer system fault checking. Which is too complex to explain here.   Most common issues → least."

I just found this video which seems to have the solutions to this issue:   https://youtu.be/064Ilsz8Fzg  Hopefully to just my spark plugs!!

I'm laying that all out, because the most recent reviews have a lot in common with shill postings.  Only good things to say, with almost the same good things to say, posted like clockwork over a span of time, and all the reviewers have only written one review.  Yelp is even more erratic.

On the other, you're not currently a customer, and it appears as though they understand that at you're current location you'll not even be a prospective customer in the foreseeable future, so you can't necessarily blame them from triaging your inquiry. As much as any company would love to get back to each client and prospect in a timely manner, it simply doesn't happen every time."
bloomington,3braqy,elladour,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:59:16 2015 UTC,"Notably, the new FCC rules aren't legislation- they're administrative rulemaking.  A difference I bring up not to be a pedantic turd, but to suggest that there might actually be something that people could do about persuading the FCC to change its rule, or petitioning the FCC to adopt new rules.  Any time large agencies make substantive rules, there is a period during which they accept public comments- usually it's mostly trade groups who have the expertise and the interest, but comments are accepted from everyone who submits them.  There are also often procedural devices to petition for a new rulemaking.  You'd probably need support, as well as an attorney familiar with administrative practice to draft the comments.  But I actually think that well-written comments supported by a large part of Bloomington, maybe joined by other towns in similar situations, could be influential in FCC rulemaking on funding for broadband expansion."

Last year they were amazing, they had some amazing japenese shells involved and it was bar none the best show I've ever seen anywhere. The show stopper was when they set off 80 gallons of gas and made a massive explosion.

bloomington,3bqtd2,A_Meager_Beaver,3,Wed Jul 1 19:52:13 2015 UTC,"I guess it honestly depends on your perspective and life experience.  From my own, here's what strikes me as bizarre:    Four youths are involved, only one is armed with what is presumably a replica of a real gun (since that's what most Airsoft guns are.)  Somehow the victim discovered it's only a replica, either because the youths are sick fucks and shot him after scaring him, or by some other quirky means.  The parking garage itself is lit like a beacon, and right off a main thoroughfare off the very southwest corner of campus, as well as right up the street from where Kirkwood dead-ends at Indiana, meaning a lot of people walk by there.  And no attempt at what motive they all had for assaulting him is even hinted at.  Also, ""Jinkies!"" --- you'll recognize them by the distinct article of clothing (gym shorts) they're all wearing.    In other words, all the details seem... off.  Perhaps such a thing is actually quite normal, even in Bloomington.    And if that's true, I wish that someone had told me sooner!  I would've opened shop like Encyclopedia Brown years ago, just to make bank at cracking cases like this one.  (Because it was obviously Bugs Meany and the Gym Shorts Sharks, trying to intimidate the guy who took over his old gang, the Tigers.  The key clue was the gym shorts!)  Now where's my 25 cents for the day, plus expenses.      {edited, because my formatting made it look like I was shouting in all bold, which makes me look like a Bugs Meany level assclown.

I say high school cause they probably thought, ""okay, let's wear gym shorts so we can run faster if we get chased!"" And the victim noticing that it was an airsoft gun probably means that they didn't blacken out the bright orange tip that all of them are required to have.   I don't know, just seems like high schoolers thinking they're cool or masculine by committing random acts of violence. But I appreciate the input!"

Unfortunately since I'm in summer classes I only really have time to play a League of Legends match or two lately (My favorite series is Final Fantasy. Especially the XIII trilogy). I'm also open minded and don't judge anyone, as well a supporter of equal rights all the same. I also grew up in a poor family, and still live in one. So I know how that feels. As far as anime goes, I used to watch a lot of it. I'm slowing down recently though. Feel free to look at my list: http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Yaiishi Also, my steam is Yaiishi. Feel free to message me here or add me on steam to have a chat.   This goes for anyone looking for friends. I'm open to talk to anyone who wants to."
bloomington,3bobee,Yaiishi,5,Wed Jul 1 01:22:06 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'll run just about any tabletop RPG you can think of, and maybe some you can't.   Three words: Common Room Games.

bloomington,3bobee,DrRotwang,6,Wed Jul 1 04:07:06 2015 UTC,"I've honestly thought about doing something like this post but I am way too chickenshit, so kudos!  I might be too old for you (if that's a thing? 27 married female post-grad-school Bloomington settler) but I'm crazy awkward and terrible at approaching people in real life, so I never really managed to make a friend here in town. I'm a nerd too, with limited game tastes (mostly the elder scrolls but I'm open to other stuff) and can enjoy pretty much any movie genre except the really gross/slapstick comedies. Not into partying but I'm down with having a couple of chill drinks once in a while with someone other than my husband. When I get together with my old friends who live far away we mostly just have a meal/watch a movie/play a game. I'd love to have that locally.  I'd be down to talk if you (or anyone else -- sorry to piggyback, haha, but I do love the solidarity in people who need friends in the comments here) wanted to. :)"
bloomington,3bobee,leafy_green_,5,Wed Jul 1 04:24:18 2015 UTC,"I'd like to say that it'd be awesome to hang out sometime, but I need to make a bold choice instead.  Let's make some plans, right here, right now right very soon.  You too /u/leafy_green_ (who used the descriptive term ""chickenshit"", which is a favorite of mine).  You as well, /u/Yaiishi.  Yes, and also you, /u/Drexore!  And as for you, /u/food__library, I can't make you any promises on being a buddy.  I can offer you a chance at some quality time with strangers neighbors.  So, first proposal:  If no one has plans for the evening of the Fourth and you're in town, then we fix that.  Go see the fireworks at the fairgrounds for example.  (Those have a special place in my heart, because of the epic, IMAX screen worthy fireball that they had at the end of last year's show.)  Second, if you do have plans for the Fourth, then there's this back-up notion I have.  It involves some kind of picnic, though I'm still hashing out the details.  The general theme of the my notions is ""Challenge yourself, or else prove that you can""... but that whole idea might be demented.  ..... Hmmm, I should probably tell the Ess-Oh that I'm making plans which she'll get sucked into.  [Hey /u/Secret-Circus {!}... yer asleep, but I'm making plans, and I don't want to forget to let you know.]  And to make it perfectly clear: anyone who wants can get in on this.  Like you, /u/Purge77 --- since you indicated a like for making friends and/or hanging out.  Seriously though, if I didn't name you, it's mainly because you indicated you're already involved in social functions, while I decided to pick on the people who indicated that they're folks who struggle sometimes.

But doing things for people, especially planning things to challenge things that they see as kinda sucking about their life... well, that I can do.

I read everyone's comments and I just want to say that I never thought this would get that much attention.

bloomington,3bm4k0,ribbondino,7,Tue Jun 30 09:32:43 2015 UTC,"Everyone keeps mentioning those maps that are sold at baitshops. Those aren't a reliable source because if you check the copyright or datestamp, you'll find that the maps data is 30 years old.  Topography maps aren't helpful because they are at best a rough estimate of the underwater depths. Topo maps are better served for scaling the hills and valleys surrounding the late.  What's needed is a bathmetry map. The DNR is in the process of doing this for all of Indiana's lakes but they've only done the small lakes thus far. Here's the one for Lake Griffy to give you an idea.  So, having said all of that. You might find some help working the USGS's EarthExplorer and going through the datasets to see if you can find something that helps. Way back in the early 2000's, I used to use TerraServer to make topographical overlays for maps I hiked that I would print out on transparancy paper to lay on my maps. But now TerraServer is super expensive so I'd stick with EarthExplorer."

I worked there around five months and in that time saw something like ten people come and go. She is arbitrarily critical, irrational and inconsistent. It is absolute chaos because there is no logical means of work distribution. When it gets really busy and nobody there is any good, tables get neglected on a basis of assuming someone else has taken care of it. This is, as far as I am concerned, not the fault of the wait staff but instead in the principle of the place. Also, tips are split, so if you really liked your waiter, give them a tip in their hand as you leave. Just an fyi. As I said, the food is great and super cheap for the quantity (curries are bae)."

He agreed, then evidently forgot all about it.  For whatever reason, upon randomly happening by a few days later and seeing the lumber in the back of one of said roommates' trucks, he flew into a psychotic rage because this was ""trashy"".  An argument ensued in which Larry was throwing said lumber around and screaming all manner of various colorful racial epithets at my roommates (e.g. ""you stupid dago"").  Classy.

A man who introduced himself as ""a contract painter"" showed my room mate and I the place but then dismissed himself and invited us to come and go between the two units as we pleased.   The first smelled like a nasty damp basement. That's when the painter explained that the company (which he didn't even know the name of) does not transfer the utilities when tenants move out so everything smelled damp due to the humidity and no a/c. The back porch was completely covered in moss, there was mildew on the siding, and mildew around the gasket on the fridge (which also smelled funky).   The 2nd unit wasn't much better. The carpet was thrashed though it had been freshly painted. The painter is using the kind of paint that smells like nasty funeral home flowers, so I can only imagine what they're trying to cover up. There was gunk caked on the sink and the stove had no door.   Given the price, we were willing to deal with a bit of sleeze. To be honest, the appearance that the landlord doesn't nosy around the complex is a bit appealing to me. I like to live my life and I hate when landlords come around to see if you're using nails to hang your art (...yes and I'll patch it before I leave, thankyouverymuch.). As the painter was on the phone with Jeff, he asked the name of the company and let him know that we were on our way over to take the apartment. We left and went straight to the office but found it empty with no indication that anyone had been there at all that day. My roomie called but nobody picked up, though by the end of the day he had been emailed the rental application.   I shared this thread with him and we'll not be renting from Pendragon."

Armani, Prada, Invicta watches coated in Diamonds. They of course started flaunting in conversation the amounts of money they and their families controlled.

Every one has, and will have, a different story, some will perhaps have more stories than another, but no one will have no story.  In the end, whether one agrees to disagree or simply agrees, we are all one. (for now, at least!)  p.s.  It would be nice if a large majority over a small minority (overall that is speaking) could appreciate, simplicity. IMHO, as what it really comes down to is an overall balancing. Which it is hard to really say whether we've shot way beyond such, or are gradually approaching?  That all is circumstantial; yet regarding beggars in at least this society, culture along with structural strings of it, there is a huge imbalance and definitely they are not considered equal (there's a lot of inconsideration and ungrounded non sense going on)."
bloomington,3b76c0,RightTrash,-2,Sat Jun 27 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like the part George glazed over is the acceptance and following of social norms. Whether work is productive or not is largely irrelevant, he's right. Look at how much guard labor is wasted in protecting wealth. From lawyers to security guards, it's all unproductive labor that contributes nothing to society.  I think the issue comes down to what we consider socially acceptable, and what we don't. When people cross those lines, they get despised, it's really that simple. Approaching me on the street with requests is outside my social norm.  There are professional fund raisers, and I treat them just like beggars if they approach me on the street or when I'm trying to walk in to a grocery store.  The sales people who cold call me are even lower in my social standing and often get a much worse wrath than beggars.  Following the local social norms is the key to acceptance. Whatever those norms may be. You may try changing society's norms, however good luck getting people to accept being randomly harassed on the street. I don't care who you work for, if you do that you're breaking a social convention I will never abandon, and will likely get some nasty attitude back, even if you're the police."
bloomington,3b76c0,sentry360,3,Fri Jun 26 18:46:56 2015 UTC,I believe the idea is that these social norms should be reconsidered in light of recognizing the humanity of the people that you are so willing to show your 'nasty attitude.'
bloomington,3b76c0,sentry360,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:16:03 2015 UTC,"I think that it is in fact in light of recognizing this humanity that they get the 'nasty attitude' in the first place. It is in recognizing that they should (and often do) know better than to harass me on the street that forms the negative emotion in the first place. If I thought that they were truly ignorant of the social norm, my reaction would likely be different. If I thought they truly needed help, bleeding, being attacked, etc... my reaction would likely be different. However if they choose to look past my humanity and the fact that I don't want to be harassed like every other human being, they deserve whatever attitude is coming to them. Respect is a two way street, and those that don't show it don't deserve it. The sign-holders however, I got nothing against those folks as long as they don't try to bother me when I walk by."

bloomington,3b76c0,hamfriend,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"The problem with this general sort of attitude is acting like one knows better than everyone else, and resorting to petty name-calling instead of sticking the rhetoric when someone disagrees.  Also when you dig through my history for dirt to sling at me, a) get it right,  b) get it right.   a) per kickstarter   b) Per fiber, after hearing arguments about costs I stared questioning the idea of municipal fiber.

bloomington,3b76c0,hamfriend,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"I wasn't calling you a name.  I was just saying that the statements you made seem self-centered.  That seems a fair assessment of the statement that you are not interested in contributing to the needs of others.  It's not flattering, but I figured that since you're espousing that view, you wouldn't care.  I brought up those instances to see how you reconcile apparent interest in altruistic projects with your apparent principled stand against helping others that you're making here.  Asking you to reconcile the two had a purpose directly related to the discussion at hand, which is discerning whether you actually have some principled/philosophical framework, or if you are actually okay with some instances of public contribution, so long as they are instances that you benefit from.  And you sort of confirmed suspicions of the latter.  Which makes the Coasian problem of the public commons relevant."
bloomington,3b76c0,sentry360,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:11:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, you seem pretty okay with the idea of people contributing their money to your kickstartr, or to publicly subsidized fiber internet, or other projects that you care about.

bloomington,3b76c0,bitterhorn,0,Sun Jun 28 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"Saying that you support altruism isn't a baseless accusation.  First, generally, altruism is a good thing.  Second, it has a basis.  Your previous post.  As far as giving money, well, we're talking about something different than what you originally said, which is ""And no, I don't want to work more to take care of others' needs"".  If you're just arguing that one should do one's due diligence to ensure maximum impact of money given to help others, that seems like a different argument than the one you were making before."

bloomington,3b76c0,bitterhorn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"Your second sentence is specious - clearly there's no such thing as ""humanizing harrassment.""  Unless your experiences walking down Kirkwood are wildly divergent from my own (and I'm not saying that is necessarily impossible), I find your choice of the word ""harrassment"" in this context to be a little extreme.  Are you in fact being threatened or made to feel afraid, or just Mildly Uncomfortable/Irritated?  When I hear the word ""harrassment"" I think of people who have the time and energy and means to threaten one another's bodily autonomy or reputation in an ongoing and meaningful way.  I think about the way men behave toward people they want to fuck at bars.  I think of people who yell and spit and throw shit from moving vehicles where there's no risk of reprisal.  I certainly don't find the obnoxiousness I think you're referring to on par with things of that nature."
bloomington,3b76c0,sentry360,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe a more succinct way to put it is that ""harassment"" requires an implicit power imbalance that I don't really see in the scenarios you describe."

Not sure if still happening, check their website.  I never went myself, but everyone I met at the church was awesome so I'm sure the class is great.

bloomington,3ask3a,onephenom,6,Tue Jun 23 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"A couple things you can check  1) Remove any splitters in the line and go direct from wall to your modem. If you don't have any splitters, scratch this off.  2) Check your signal levels on your modem.  You can log in to your modem by going to your web browser and typing 192.168.0.1 (or 192.168.100.1 if that doesn't work) into the address bar (not a google search).  That will bring you to a web interface with different pages, one of which is something like ""diagnostics.""  If you can't find it, google your modem brand and model as well as diagnostics and find what the address for that page is on your modem.  Compare your leves to what they should be (here's a guideline: http://www.dslreports.com/faq/16085)  If you find signals are weak, or your modem is SCREAMING with high power levels, there's something in the line causing that.  Could be a splitter (which is why you want to test removing that first), but it's also very likely it's someone on your node back feeding a signal into the line.  I learned way too much about this stuff when we were having comcast issues.  We eventually got in touch with the maintenance manager for the area and he kept teams out in our area until they found the interference and filtered it out.  It took about 3 months for them to find the source once I finally convinced them there was a problem.  Feel free to ask away.  Post your results here if you need help deciphering them."

It's not JUST a DNS issue (based on controlled tests I've performed at work), though I will say that those horseshit 75.75.x.x DNS server pools are FREQUENTLY incapable of dealing with not pointing to DNS servers that are known to be down, so the suggestion about repointing your DNS elsewhere couldn't hurt."

People can also mask signs of intoxication long enough to get another drink. Thanks to our liquor laws, most of the onus is on the server to decide how much a person has had to drink. There is certainly lots responsibility there but before you blame the server for over-serving, maybe consider blaming the drinker for being irresponsible."

bloomington,3arawk,endowdly,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"Okay since you're just going to ignore or down vote my question, I'm going straight to pedantic mode. First let's address suffering. You wouldn't know suffering if it slapped you in the face, took your fucking job and house and left you on the street. If you think 'suffering' is equitable to a girl going to a bar, an establishment that provides primarily only alcoholic beverages, giving a server cash or money (something people who suffer rarely have) and then receiving a good or service in a trade THEY initiated is suffering, your priorities are completely fucked. If you think having the luxury of being able to drink too much is suffering, I don't think you know what that word means. If you really think that someone who is able to purchase enough booze for themselves to get drunk by putting a glass to their own lips too much is suffering, I invite you to do homeless charity work and international aid relief work because you have no idea what suffering is. You live in America. You can walk down the streets without getting shot at or bombed because of your religious sect, you can actually go to the bar and drink alone as a woman without being arrested or stoned, you have access to clean, potable water any time. Leave the shock value at home. No one is suffering in the story.   Responsibility. I don't think you now what this word means either. The girl who drank had the responsibility to know what her limits were. Wether that be financial limits or limits of drunkenness to either remain legal (drink in public and drink driving laws) or to keep from being impaired. Those are HER responsibility because SHE is paying for the drinks and then putting them in her mouth. The server has a legal responsibility to operate under the law and then a responsibility to his or her job. Which is to take money and give people the drinks they ask for. If this girl says, ""hey, make it strong"" and slips in another couple bucks, the server probably will. The girl knows her limits, right? But it's absolutely always the servers' fault when someone doesn't know their limits and over drinks, right? There is no wrong doing on either side of this story. It's the servers responsibility to do their job. It's the consumers responsibility to know their limits and conduct themselves legally. I see no wrong, no over serving in this story. Know your limits be responsible for yourself."

If you take the grub ridge trail (off of the main trail that leads from the fire tower parking lot) depending on how far you want to hike, you will find various camping spots along the way. If you decide to go down to the valley, there is a really big camp spot that's pretty awesome and off of the main path. There's also a trail that leads to the lake.

That other trail /u/IntellectumValdeAmat refers to is Peninsula Trail, a nice little hike down the the lake's edge.  There are about 6 designated camp sites there, but you can actually pitch a tent almost anywhere you want in the Deam.  You just have to be so many feet from the trail and streams.  My personal favorite is Sycamore Trail.  No horses allowed, so the trail is in better shape, and there's no poop.  If you're going Grubb, I find the prettiest part is just north of the horse camp.  If you head from the Grubb parking area towards Peninsula, it can be a muddy slog.  There are lots of good tent locations, though.  Here's a map of the whole area."

bloomington,3anwvg,iugameprof,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:40:28 2015 UTC,"I came to IU as a bored Comp Sci major. I tried Informatics for a semester, but was even more bored. I noticed cog sci as an informatics concentration option and after reading/discussing it switched to it in a heartbeat.  The problem of, what do I apply this to, you describe seems prevalent in cog sci majors. The department seems full of smart people that are bored with most subjects and want to carve their own path. Carving your own path is rather hard in the job market though.  If you are technically inclined it should be easy for you to apply your degree. For me, coming from a computer background I could have likely substituted my cog sci degree anywhere it says comp sci or equivalent. However I dropped out before I finished (took on too much debt and didn't want to let it grow) and started working full time.  Still working, still coding, but have moved on to trying to start my own business at the moment. Have done a class or two since I left, and would love to finish my degree, I just don't have the time.  Long story short, your degree is very versatile, I'm sure you could do business stuff with it if you angle it right. If you're a computer person, most coding jobs already look past degrees for experience, so a cog sci degree would just be icing on the cake. Especially for anything cognition related, natural language processing, voice/image recognition, etc...  Outdoor work however... What kind of work are you hoping to do? The only angle, and not a big one at that, within cog sci, is anthropology, and I already know of anthropology majors without jobs. The rest of the fields, comp sci, psych, linguistics, and neuroscience seem like rather indoor work. I'm sure there may be research grants out there that involve outdoors, but not sure how many there are out there. Also many cog sci folks go on to grad school as well, more than from most fields I've met. That may make it hard to get the few cog sci jobs actually out there, so I would suggest picking an angle. What did you concentrate in? What subjects did you take? Did any part of the field interest you more than other parts? Were you particularly good at any classes vs other ones?"

It is a non-profit fair trade store, which means everything in the store is hand-crafted by artisans in developing countries. If you are not familiar, fair trade basically means that the people who made the items sold in the store are given a fair wage for their work. Fair trade also promotes environmentally friendly products, women's rights, helps to keep families working in their own communities, and works to end child labor, and exploitative business practices.   It is a great place with great volunteers. Volunteers even get 15% off their purchases in the store. They always welcome new volunteers.   Here's a link to their website http://www.globalgiftsft.com/ as well as information for the Bloomington store.   Address: 122 N. Walnut St. Bloomington, IN 47404  Phone: (812) 336-7402  Hours: Mon - Thurs: 10:30am - 6:30pm Fri - Sat: 10:30am - 8pm Sun: 11am to 5pm"

They have bikes for sale and a program which allows you to earn a bike in exchange for three hours of labor. I am a year-round bike commuter and thus a big fan of their services. They are somewhat unique in that they are completely volunteer-run (no paid staff) and strive for non-hierarchical, consensus based decision making. They are located at the intersection 7th & the B-line.  Their Grimes location, known as the Switchyard building, closed this winter and is now home to the Center for Sustainable Living, a 501c3 umbrella organisation for a number of projects, including Bike Project, Share Bloomington, Open Streets, Discardia / Mending Day, SIREN, and a couple others. Their website is simplycsl.org. I can provide more information or put you in touch with just about any of the CSL projects."

bloomington,3a7tfs,Tdeckard2000,8,Wed Jun 17 22:18:07 2015 UTC,I'd only put one of these bars in my top seven.
bloomington,3a7tfs,nowahhh,2,Wed Jun 17 23:33:48 2015 UTC,Sports and Blue Bird didn't make the cut because they wouldn't let me film : P
bloomington,3a7tfs,ReddicaCrackhead,7,Thu Jun 18 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"It's an extremely subjective topic. For bars not on the list:  OP mentioned not being able to film in Bluebird or Sports. IMO the Bluebird is alright for music, but they pack people like sardines for bigger shows. and Sports is basically exactly like Kilroy's on Kirkwood (so not a terrible bar by any means) but without the legacy of KOK and a history of sexual preditors.  Atlas: awesome welcoming atmosphere for alternative crowd, amazing art on the walls. not an extensive selection, but very tastful selection of beer, wine, and spirits.  Bishop: consistently bringing in talented and interesting musical acts, a good place to start a conversation or smoke cigarettes. Smallish but great selection of craft beers. My personal #1  Back Door: a gay bar. Lots of outdoor seating. Usually a good deal on some craft brew. Also they have good music events, which are a great time for a straight guy such as myself to enjoy a different atmosphere without being aggressively hit-on. Bonus: The Blockhouse is a music venue directly below the Backdoor, and is a legitimate contender among ""bar"" music/arts venue downtown, if only you can find the unmarked entrance.   Serendipity: only been there once but it's super classy and has amazing cocktails.  Cardinal Spirits: They make all their own Booze, all of which are top-notch. Great cocktails and nice atmosphere, not a ""bar"", but a great place to casually get drunk.   Bear's Place: a pretty standard bar, but they have comedy nights and smash brothers tournaments.   The Upstairs: is shit in my opinion. What is great about it? Name one thing."
bloomington,3a7tfs,nowahhh,3,Thu Jun 18 00:41:24 2015 UTC,"Add to that the Tap (the smaller tap room on Kirkwood is my personal #1), Quaff On (the Tap does everything QO does much better, but QO will give you $1 PBR if you ask for a House Bar PBR [RIP House Bar]), and the Alley Bar."

bloomington,3a7tfs,Tipar,3,Tue Jun 23 00:17:27 2015 UTC,"The Upstairs is such a great bar because it allows for a variety of people to mix. It's not really ""fratty"" or ""hipster,"" so people from different groups go there and meet and hang out. It is a good place to go with a small group of friends and meet new people. Plus they have pretty nice cork dart boards and the darts are nice quality for a bar. Also AMF's. They're also really lenient on bar crawls, so you can get away with some stuff there. Once they finish their balcony I bet it'll soon become a more popular place to go. It's personally my favorite bar, so I might be biased, but picking bars is pretty subjective anyway."

bloomington,3a7tfs,OneOfTheWills,2,Thu Jun 18 04:53:17 2015 UTC,White. Balance.
bloomington,3a7tfs,OneOfTheWills,3,Wed Jun 17 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I actually color graded it for that blue hue. This video was produced for a company, so it's tailored to them."
bloomington,3a7tfs,PartTimeVelociraptor,3,Wed Jun 17 23:05:30 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate on their part, then. Blue does not spell out ""hey, come to this awesomely fun bar!"" They should have also known that color grading is meant to set a mood on the image. Not what one would expect from a ""Top so and so"" list video.  Also, if you did color grade this, you might want to equal out your grading as my original comment on white balance was due to multiple shots having varying degrees of ""white-ish blue"". The blue hue you claim is from grading also seems to be caused by having your camera set to auto white balance and then shooting in a location with multiple light sources with varying degrees of Kelvin. In a few of your shots, the most prominent source of light seems to be incandescent which causes the LED, halogen, and Neon sources to cast a blue-ish tint.   The customer is always right, so I understand having to tailor it to them, but as the creative mind behind the shoot, you do have some say. Not just to make your own talents look more professional but to also help make their product (the video in this case) appear to have a higher quality."
bloomington,3a7tfs,fuck_steve_harvey,3,Wed Jun 17 23:23:16 2015 UTC,You're right on the mark with the auto white balance and the main lighting being halogen. Though it's probably a result of me still learning color grading. Sounds like I could learn a thing or two from you.

I'll ask my sister, as she majored at IU in Outdoor Recreation.  As far as activist groups go, I don't recall bumping into anyone other than Greenpeace asking for money.  But as far as legal and polotical effectiveness goes, there are some Sierra Club organized activity and programs in Bloomington.  Getting involved with the Hoosier Chapter of the Sierra Club is probably the best thing out there.  If you're a student, this looks particularly awesome."

bloomington,39q5l1,NoBitsFlipped,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:12:31 2015 UTC,"IU is a leviathan of liberal arts and humanities.... but it's also been slowly changing.  Various efforts have been underway to increase student numbers and graduates.  The current one involves expanding the size of the university greatly, while compromising departments into buildings of common areas study.  The only two departments that seem to do as they want unfettered are the Kelly School of Business as well as the School of Informatics.  In other words, I've noticed a disturbing pattern of diminished influence by the liberal arts and humanities, while the two most business-centric institutions buy or construct new buildings, as well as absorb other departments under their purview.  Perhaps it makes good budgetary sense, though I'm just not sure myself.  Regardless, because the school was such a liberal influence for so very long, the town itself will remain that way as well for a long time to come.  Certainly no arguments there."
bloomington,39q5l1,Daedalistic-Outlook,11,Sun Jun 14 20:11:49 2015 UTC,"IIRC Bloomington got fucked pretty hard in the 2010 state and national redistricting. A bunch of people got cut into the Martinsville district. So, we're still pretty liberal, but the Republicans have rigged the system to keep us underrepresented. Local politics are overwhelmingly dominated by Democrats.  Frankly, drive 20 minutes in any direction (except maybe some of Brown County, where the nature-loving IU professors live) and you might as well be teleported into South Carolina. But with less hiking of the Appalachian trail."
bloomington,39q5l1,Used-Car-Salesman,4,Sat Jun 13 22:26:33 2015 UTC,"Up until the last major gerrymandering effort by the state, there used to be several hotspots of blue activity, while the rest of the state went red.   Northwest Indiana Indianapolis Bloomington Evansville Fort Wayne [area]   The problem was: these parts of Indiana managed to outvote the rest of the state, and so Indiana's electoral votes went to Barack Obama.  Various out-in-the-open and closet racists across the state went nuts over this.  Consequently, it resulted in not only a massive gerrymandering effort to try to dissolve as much blue as possible, but stricter voting ID laws and such.  I admit that the above doesn't have anything to do directly with Bloomington's own political scene, but I wanted to offer some sense of this town within the rest of the state.  For some this town is an oasis of blue, while for others it can be a resort that turns hostile if you don't agree quickly enough.  I've also seen classist instructors and business owners in the same day that I've dealt with yet other professors and residents who strive to have everyone be heard without first assuming who is marginalized or even why.

bloomington,39q5l1,jaymz668,3,Wed Jun 17 02:28:17 2015 UTC,"It used to be that Bloomington and Indianapolis were the two left-of-center areas in Indiana, but there may be a bit more now.  You still have the strongly conservative landscape of mostly rural southern Indiana, but thanks to the university, there is a lot more left/progressive thought prominent here.  But as soon as you get away from the most heavily university-influenced areas, politics follow rural thought very quickly.   EDIT: I don't mean 'rural' in a pejorative way here.  What I mean is that even in the fewer progressive peoples, many of the issues important to their thought and political affiliation are closer to the issues that rural conservatives hold.  I work west of US37, and one of the most consistently democratic-voting people I work with is a strong, vocal, unmarried woman about to retire, but at the same time, she is a southern baptist who describes gays as 'disgusting' or that another liberal-identified guy does rape victim blaming. I find it weird when I find out that some of my super pro-gay coworkers are staunchly republican, even when they completely agree with my 100% feminist buzz lines that I throw around.   I really don't understand the dividing lines for the issues out here, but in this case, I think supporting and including friends and family means being some of the most aggressively accepting people around.  But this is all anectdotal.  Check maybe a census report.   EDIT 2: I think I got a bit off-topic.  tl;dr: I don't know how to answer any of your questions directly, but this is how they make me feel."

And makes people more likely to form opinions on hot-button issues in something of a vacuum, and creates a climate that's not very amenable to debating them."

Before the Hilton was built, there was a parking garage there.  This was where the townies hung out on Friday & Saturday nights.  Causing hell and networking.  Friends would get together and do what was called a ""lap"".  This lap took College down to Kirkwood, over to Indiana, Indiana up to 10th, then Dunn back to Kirkwood, Kirkwood back to Walnut up to 7th to return to the garage on College.  The variations on this ""lap"" were numerous, but this was the path I typically took.  Still with me?  Well, I did one of those laps on little 5 weekend but something was different about mine.  I did what is referred to as a ""neutral drop"" at every stop sign & light the entire lap.  I owned a small car with a large V8 at the time.  This was my way of asserting my territory on the students at the time.  While sitting in traffic on Kirkwood, bumper to bumper, in front of the Indiana Theater, I noticed 4 guys getting out of an SUV directly behind me.  Within a second or two my passenger and I had guns in our faces and we were being physically pulled from my car.  We were given breathalizers and asked if we were under the influence of any illegal drugs.  They could tell that we were just teenagers having a little fun, and let us go.  He told me that if he saw my car downtown again that weekend that I would be put in jail.  I haven't been downtown during a little 5 weekend since.  That was almost 20 years ago."

These two cops pull up in their squadcar right next to me.  As in, I'm in my car, waiting for cars on my left to move, with no way forwards or backwards.  The cop riding shotgun shouted at me with the window rolled down: ""You have to move your car NOW!""  ""I can't until you move.""  ""I said MOVE!""

Yeah, I totally regret all that."
bloomington,39f8hf,TheVodkaDrink,12,Thu Jun 11 10:55:23 2015 UTC,"there is so much BS in this statement I don't even know where to begin. You have to go through a court martial to be dishonorably discharged, and ""not passing a pt test when the LT told me to"" is not going to court martial. try again."

It also requires you be given time to correct the performance deficiency, not just one failure, and approval up the chain of command.

bloomington,39f8hf,Used-Car-Salesman,0,Thu Jun 11 19:56:25 2015 UTC,"Again, since I'm still stuck at work, maybe I worded something wrong. It was a Chapter 13 for disobeying the chain of command, or something along those lines (in more official terms). I tore a ligament during some routine training exercise. After a couple months of rehab they had me take a pt test, which I failed. The (at the time) CSM told me if I failed another he would chapter me out. I failed the second one, got pulled in to talk to the Captain over our unit who told me all about the chapter and what all it entailed and gave me a 3rd chance the same day as my 2nd chance. I missed my 2 mile by 30 seconds or so and within maybe a month was out. This was all while in AIT at fort Gordon I was in barracks RBK09, my CSM was CSM Espee and my captain was Cpt Elmer(sp?) Why would I lie about a dishonorable discharge? The only reason I can figure I got it was because it was cheaper than giving me benefits. I don't care to be called a vet, I didn't do anything to deserve the title, I don't see its relevance here."
bloomington,39f8hf,Used-Car-Salesman,2,Thu Jun 11 20:35:37 2015 UTC,you should have mentioned you got kicked out while still in boot camp. i would never even have gotten myself involved in this

bloomington,39f8hf,musical_hog,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:06:13 2015 UTC,"They can't force you to take a PT test with a torn ligament. You should have been on profile. Something still doesn't add up. Why weren't you on profile? If you were put on profile and hadn't recovered in time, you should go back on profile. You do realize they give you surgery for those right? Torn ligaments don't just heal ""with rehab"".   Did you get a diagnosis that was torn ligament. Did you get a profile for it. Did you get surgery for it. Did you get a recovery profile. They don't just make soldiers with torn ligaments take PT tests."

Clearly this set the tone for the night.   Later we ourselves go to the Backdoor which has a... tropicana theme that night. We proceed to get drunk, and do a wheel of fortune thing with some young ladies who were gathering funds for some kinda charity. We win, among other things, a riding crop of a definitely sexual nature which we hit each other with.  We then decide to go home, and go up to the top of the roof of that parking garage right next to it. As we stand up there, three people now, we stare down at the Backdoor and gawddammit it still looks awesome. We aint done! This night is too cool! it cant end here! We go back down there....   Suddenly the entire Backdoor seem to have erupted into a mayhem of dancing - of highlights I will mention me, a person who mostly go for 90's boombap rap getting down to Ariana Grande and Iggy Azalea, and a tall superslim dude in a tophat, bare chest and jeans shorts getting down like it was nobody's business.   At the end we go home, back up the garage wearing just our shirts, the two fine ladies in their bras and me just with my manly Dane-chest. Nice cold weather on your skin after some dancing and drinking, you know you love it.

I make that turn all the time and have a good sense of how far/fast cars are coming.  Half way through my turn I realized I wouldn't make it in front of the Camaro.  So - I tried to get to just get across and to the east shoulder of 446.  The Camaro did the same and went around me on the right - probably within a foot (and off the shoulder).  I'm 100% sure he was going significantly faster than 80 as quoted in the HT.  He also passed the next two cars without slowing down (one on the right and one on the left).  DNR was following - maybe a half mile behind.  I'm not sure when the driver saw read & blue lights (according to HT), but he definitely wasn't slowing down when he passed me."

I was riding through there this past weekend, and was following a black Camaro. This guy was such a horrible driver, I swear he almost went off the road three or four times. He would speed way up in what little straight sections there were, and then absolutely slam on the brakes, well into the corners. He was all over BOTH lanes. If there had been any sort of oncoming traffic, in pretty much any corner, he would have caused a wreck easily."

bloomington,38zlgt,ribbondino,5,Mon Jun 8 04:11:21 2015 UTC,"I got my name changed in Monroe County.  Have you been to the clerk's office at the county courthouse yet? You'll need to take your fully filled out paperwork there (in quadruplicate, I think—at least triplicate, though), file the paperwork and pay the fee. You'll be assigned a court date when you go into the clerk's office to file the paperwork. The court only hears name change hearings one Wednesday per month, so it might be a while before your court date rolls around. Between the date you file and your court date, you'll have to run two or three (I don't remember which, though I think it's three) announcements in a local newspaper notifying people about your name change. (This is so that folks whom you might owe money or the like can get a heads up and come find you at or before your hearing; it's antiquated, yes, but the step is still on the books and therefore necessary.) The newspaper will send you proof that the announcements ran, and you'll have to file that proof with the court. When your court date comes around, you'll go down to the courthouse with all of your paperwork, and the judge will either decide that you can change your name or you can't. I have no idea how often judges say no; my hearing was quick and without complications, but I was getting married, didn't have any felonies, didn't have any debts I was trying to shirk, etc. Depending on what your reasons are (and they will ask), your hearing might go more smoothly or less so. After that, the real fun begins: You get a court order from the judge effecting your name change, and you get to start changing your name with the BMV, Social Security administration, your landlord, your bank/credit union, your student loan collector, your credit card companies, your utilities, your Internet provider, your employer, etc., etc., etc. It's a huge hassle."

However, a quick out-and-back that is always good is riding down to Pine Grove via Knightridge. Route is mapped out here. If I could make a suggestion, though, between markers 3 and 18 on the map there is a road called S. Baldwin Drive (you might have to zoom in a little to see it). I would take Baldwin Drive to Brighton Crest rather than riding down Smith Road, which is narrow and can be busy at certain times of day with people paying more attention to their phones than to the road. You will be on 446 for a mile or so, but the shoulder is large and in good repair. There is a little dive restaurant called The Cabin and it's a good place to stop if you need to fuel up after climbing back out of Pine Grove Road. If you're not a fan of hills, you can turn around before going down Pine Grove. There are a couple roads you can explore off of Knightridge (Gross Road, Duke Road, Inverness Woods) to add on some miles. I rode my first century on this route by doing laps just off Knightridge Road. 100 miles of the same few miles got a little old, but I still like to ride this route.

bloomington,38og0j,peachesandchrome,9,Fri Jun 5 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"Sometimes they come to inspect because they have received a tip that your rental home may be in violation of the maximum occupancy limitation.  For example, you have 4 unrelated people living in a rental home that is zoned/approved for 3 tenants.  In this case, the inspector will be counting the number of bedrooms, beds, tenants, cars, etc.  I've been through that before, personally.  But otherwise, it's probably like /u/CynicallyObservant said.  HAND inspects rental units for permit renewals.  They'll make sure things like smoke detectors, windows, egress, electricity, etc. are up to code.    They won't root through your belongings, but you may want to hide illegal paraphernalia from plain view. Your landlord may be present for the inspection.  You also need to not be violating your lease by having disabled your smoke detectors or barricaded a window or exit."

bloomington,38og0j,PartTimeVelociraptor,5,Fri Jun 5 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"Ah.  Depends.  If the additional person doesn't put you over the maximum occupancy that your house is zoned for (usually 3, sometimes 5 or more), then HAND won't care.  Your landlord is another can of worms.  But if you are over the max occupancy, HAND will definitely care. They will order the non-official resident to move out and they can assess a fine for each week that the person stays after the order to vacate.  I believe that fine is something absolutely absurd, like $1200.  No kidding.  That said, we easily passed our inspection by having 3 people home instead of 4, only 3 cars, only 3 towels, etc.  And the 4th bedroom was set up to look like a home office (NO BED!).  If you're not sure what your home is zoned for, you need to look at this form  Your landlord was required to give you one when you signed your lease.  More on over-occupancy here.  EDIT:  It's also very important that the extra tenant doesn't receive their mail at the house.  Have them get a P.O. Box. It's like 40 bucks."

bloomington,38og0j,devilboy222,2,Fri Jun 5 17:45:57 2015 UTC,"I think they can still go set up their P.O. box and have their mail re-forwarded to the box with little trouble. We have a couple postal carriers on this sub who may chime in with more info.  I'd tell you to call the branch, but the PO never answers their phones.  :-)    He/She will just have to go in.  For now, check to see if the extra tenant's name is on the slip of paper on your mailbox.  If it is, remove the paper.  You'll want to do this the day of the inspection, obviously.

Like someone else said they won't go through your things but have every right to go everywhere in the home. Additionally they can open cabinets and drawers in the bathroom and kitchen. The safest thing is just to stash all paraphenalia and the like with a friend until after the inspection. A friend of mine once went through this and after eliminating drug paraphenalia forgot to get rid of stolen street signs. As I recall they were confiscated with only a warning but I think he claimed they were left there when he moved in.

But I think their core concern merits discussion. I can tell you that there are times I'm more uncomfortable than other times on Kirkwood. Anecdotally, my 6 year old daughter and I have both experienced firsthand:   A man having a complete meltdown at a cashier over a drink not being cold enough. Shouting insane threats at the staff.  Two men stealing a patron's segway in broad daylight (I warned him and he chased them down to recover it) A naked woman who had clearly been using the bathroom at The Village Deli to wash up. She had been in for at least 30 minutes and assaulted a waitress when she was asked to leave.    I've heard conversations from business owners about the kind of threats they've endured. Not just them, but their family- in retaliation for asking them to leave.   These are a minority of the overall population, to be sure, but it's reached a point where it's not a surprise when trouble does happen. I don't blame the business owners for having a dialogue about it. They are running a business, after all. If people feel threatened by the environment, they'll go elsewhere. I do hope they are respectful of the challenges some of these people are going through, and respectful of the very real and unfortunate issue of homelessness, but I think you can be both supportive of them and concerned about some of the outlier issues at the same time."

They enjoy a huge windfall for the unique market benefits of setting up in a liberal arts college town.  They need to also absorb the costs.  That's what operating in a market is.  I have very little sympathy for a business that wants the windfall without paying the overhead.  If you're a business like Nick's that's a local institution, you don't try to pressure the cops into ensuring that your street stays curated- you invest back into your community to help alleviate some of the underlying issues causing the problem.  From a legal standpoint, let me just say, involving the criminal justice system with homelessness only ever makes the problem 100 times worse in the long run."

bloomington,38easg,JStancombe,-8,Thu Jun 4 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"Right.  Which accentuates the point, that without the huge stream of outside money coming in through the university, students, faculty, Bloomington would be even worse off than Bedford, which is in bad shape."

Can you draw some sort of connection between those two?   FWIW I know a lot of those businesses DO invest in their community. In some cases, they specifically support institutions that are working toward the homeless solution. That doesn't mean they can't also discuss what to do about the fringe that's causing problems. I wouldn't automatically assume they're all capitalist assholes with a complete disregard or lack of empathy for the overall problem."
bloomington,38easg,chrobb,-6,Wed Jun 3 23:47:00 2015 UTC,"There's a huge amount of affluence brought into the town by students that supports an entire street of bars- consider, no other rural southern Indiana town would be able to support an entire street of bars.  Bars are essentially cash factories with a liquor markup of 500% cost, designed to fleece that affluence off of students, who are generally transitory residents.  When you have an entire street of bars, you get lots of foot traffic, lots of boisterous (drunk) behavior, and you draw a really wide crowd.  Some part of pretty much any crowd causes trouble.  So when you make that crowd huge by creating a street that draws a huge amount of people, the portion of the crowd that causes trouble becomes noticeable, reaches critical mass.  Building an entire street of bars, then complaining that ""undesirables"" are being drawn, is cognitive dissonance.  It is the logical consequence of building a street of places like Nick's and Kilroy's.  Cracking down on homeless people for going where all the foot traffic is is essentially looking to someone else to internalize externalities generated by having an entire street of bars."
bloomington,38easg,hamfriend,6,Thu Jun 4 03:07:12 2015 UTC,"I'm curious (legitimately!) how you would suggest that additional services would solve or alleviate the homeless problem in Bloomington based on the logic you present here.  If you are suggesting that the presence of ""an entire street of bars"" will continue to draw vagrants because they can easily receive funds from drunk college students, then what leads you to believe they would seek services that require direct action to improve their lives if such services exist?  Years ago now, IIRC, there was an interview with the then-director of the Shalom house in the HT that basically begged the public not to provide money to pan handlers because it prevented them from seeking meaningful services.  If this is the case, it seems like there can be no solution from your argument as there will always be drunk students to shake down and well-meaning but misguided soup trucks to provide additional resources without forcing anyone to commit to actual change in their lives."

Most of businesses rely on returning customers from the community and niche consumers, not necessarily college students. We also live in an area that places local business on high regard.  Your second incorrect assumption is that police intervention on homeless affairs on Kirkwood would only cause it to increase 100 fold... Because arresting a homeless person makes more people homeless."

I'm curious about your expertise.  Not to pick nits, but, it would be ""Your first incorrect assumption"", not ""You're first incorrect assumption"".  Unless you are suggesting that I am first incorrect assumption, in which case, that's deep.  Otherwise, those sorts of errors undermine your credibility.  But to the substance.  I didn't assume that all local businesses do well because of college students, only some.  And college bars are among those businesses that do well because of the college students.  Which is what separates them from other bars that aren't all concentrated across the street from the edge of campus.  Notably, there is no outcry over the trouble the homeless population are causing at the Office Lounge.  Rather, it is the college bars, concentrated across the street from the edge of campus, that raise the concern.  My second assumption wasn't an assumption, but an argument, complete with premise and conclusion.  I'd recommend a prop logic course to follow that intro to econ course.  Part of the work I've done in low income legal services involves the collection of court debt, jailing fees, other kinds of local process fees that often amount to a poverty or homelessness tax.  Being jailed usually comes with a housing fee, a processing fee, potentially court costs, paid by the defendant.  The defendant is often in no shape to be able to ever pay off these fees, which grow with interest, and move to collections, sometimes as a function of the county prosecutor office.  In some cases, outstanding arrearage results in further jailing, which creates more debt, and so on.  This cycle creates additional barriers to helping homeless people off the streets and out of poverty.  It makes it impossible for many of those folks whose lives blew up to recover.  It reinforces the downward spiral which makes substance abuse and not giving a goddamn about the rules of a system that screwed them somewhat rational, or at least cognizable choices.  None of this is an assumption.  Because this is a repeating story I've seen with a lot of clients.  If you don't believe me, go down to the Shalom Center and spend a week volunteering.  Talk to the people there.  Then come back here and tell me about my second incorrect assumption."

I'm not sure what the actual impact has been like on Kirkwood, but petty crime has certainly increased in this town as more homeless people arrive in Bloomington.  We offer fantastic resources for those in need, but the city cannot afford to service everyone in need, and it has become a very real issue that we must all face.    There are no comfortable of good solutions to the growing issue, but it is an aspect of Bloomington life and culture that must be addressed."

Both friends I have that are in this instance have had to call BPD/ IUPD numerous times, in order to have the belligerent ""patrons"" removed.

bloomington,38easg,Pestilaence,-15,Wed Jun 3 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"A good way to solve the issue is providing adequate services for people.  This probably needs to come from higher taxes on the business owners, higher county taxes coming out of income and property."

There's a reason why we have such a huge homeless population, and it's because we, as a community, care about individuals in need.  Unfortunately, this means that surrounding areas, so I've heard, tell their homeless to come here for better social services and support.  Ultimately, the community's generosity is the driving force behind increased crime."
bloomington,38easg,HPHatecraft,3,Thu Jun 4 01:29:38 2015 UTC,"Usually surrounding areas simply don't have social services.  There's some bare bones state level stuff, like workforce development offices in surrounding counties.  And pro bono legal services are based here, mostly because there's, like, maybe a dozen attorneys even living in places like Lawrence and Clay counties.  And even we really lack a lot of really necessary services for case management and mental health.  We have Center Stone, but they're totally overloaded.  But that isn't a good argument for us offering fewer services.  The main reason that the homeless come here is because Bloomington is the only spot in the surrounding counties where there is concentrated wealth.  More developed services are a symptom of that wealth/education."

bloomington,38easg,oO0-__-0Oo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:21:34 2015 UTC,"Columbus has more money than other places in southern Indiana, but it is also a college town.  And if you've been through Columbus, it gets rough only a few streets from campus- while there's wealth, there's not nearly as much as there is in Bloomington.  French Lick has pretty much only tourism, and tourism is going to be hostile to a homeless population.  Greenwood's wealth is a consequence of it being a suburb of Indy- most of the wealth there is concentrated in Center Grove.  And suburbs don't really have the same sorts of concentrated populations, public spaces, that can support a homeless population.  I was mostly talking about Lawrence, Green, Owen, Clay and Morgan counties.  Places where there really aren't services.  Bloomington is that combination of sufficient urban/downtown spaces with high foot traffic, a ton of affluence in the hands of mostly stupid college kids, heavy liberal values from a mixture of youth and lots of education.  And anyway, I wouldn't say that even Bloomington ""rolls out the red carpet"" for the homeless.  Unless you count having basic accommodations so that people don't freeze to death and a mostly unsuccessful effort to provide adequate mental health services.  The only group that Bloomington rolls out the red carpet for is students, because students are the group that the major employer is attempting to attract to Bloomington.  With various amenities, including a street that is mostly bars.  Which creates foot traffic.  Which attracts/supports a homeless population."

bloomington,38easg,hamfriend,2,Sun Jun 7 05:12:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think you are just repeating things you have heard that have no basis in reality but make you, as a Bloomington resident, feel superior.   I rent to a few very poor people in Bedford and I've seen the interfaith organization step up and pay rent for them, just because they asked. Bloomington has nothing like that. Yes the community kitchen is open for a few more meals a week, but that is a pretty recent development. I've never talked to anyone who felt like they were pointed toward Bloomington for the services available. You say this happens, I'd like to see some evidence.   Now there are a few things about Bloomington that do attract homeless that have nothing to do with services. One is the number of storage units that provide bathroom service. I've known a half dozen 'homeless' in Bloomington that rent a storage unit for a very small fraction of the cost an apartment would cost. Seriously, now can people not know this. Do the people bitching about the homeless, not actually have conversations with them.   Another big problem not address is the whole Kirkwood mess. It used to get a lot of office walkers and students walking over from the university. Rents are high. Over the years the rent stayed high but students and office people have cars and go other places. The businesses on Kirkwood are struggling economically because their customer base is a fraction of what it once was, yet it has the reputation and high rents to deal with. Of all the places in Bloomington I would not want to be running a business, on Kirkwood would be my number one choice. Making people pay for parking is just another nail in their coffin. Kirkwood is a cesspool in the making. I would guess that for several of theses businesses, being an 'established place' is about all they have going for them. Otherwise they would get out too."
bloomington,38easg,daylily,0,Sun Jun 7 12:38:44 2015 UTC,"I worked this last year in low-income legal services, for an organization that includes Monroe, Morgan, Green, Lawrence, Owen and Clay County.  I'm working for a similar organization in Cleveland now, but I'll most likely be back with my old org starting back up in the fall for my last year of school.  Anyway, that job put me in contact with about 20 or so low income folks in need of civil legal services for every two week period- I helped run the brief advice walk-in legal clinics that handled a lot of issues.  I probably had about similar numbers for Green county, and roughly similar for Morgan county- though we haven't set up a walk-in clinic there yet, so there's a disproportionate number of phone intakes.  Anyway, for a fair number of these cases I wound up coordinating with case managers, sometimes relatives, and for a lot of the really screwed up family law situations or substance abuse situations, psych professionals and treatment organizations.  What I tended to notice was that a lot of those organizations, like CenterStone, Shalom, Middleway, etc. tend to be in Bloomington.  Since our office also does a lot of case placement with local attorneys pro bono, a lot of our clients wind up being placed in Bloomington simply because there are relatively few attorneys in outlying counties.  Lawrence County in particular has a fairly small number, most of whom are related to each other or work in family firms- which creates enough conflict of interest problems that a lot of Monroe County attorneys wind up practicing in Lawrence.  As far as the Greyhound Therapy goes, I should clarify, I never said anything like that takes place.  In fact, I think the guy who said it does in another thread here is full of beans.  I've never seen that sort of thing done by Lawrence County- though Lawrence is more likely to jail homeless folks for vagrancy if they're in plain sight.  But you articulated the exact question I had for that guy- where is the evidence that cities are sending people to Bloomington?  I would have asked it myself, but figured it would just get downvoted because people dislike me.  I have heard a lot of accounts of corruption in local section 8 distribution, but I don't have evidence and it comes from unreliable sources.  I've not heard of the storage unit thing.  That's interesting.  And construed in a particular way, they're not really homeless- they have housing, just substandard, unregulated, probably in really exploitative situations where it is provided.  See, now I'm putting together in my head whether there can be a constructive warrant of habitability if a LL knows that a tenant is using a facility as a domicile.  Interesting.  Do you know how widespread that is?  Last paragraph, agreed on all counts.  If you can find my massively downvoted posts across this board, you'll see arguments that the homeless population is just a logical consequence of having affluent foot traffic that is really out of place in southern Indiana but for the university and an entire street of bars that can stay in business because there is a university.  I think that decline in patronage has a lot to do with the parking situation, combined with the population shift you're beginning to see from local student neighborhoods to the massive newly constructed complexes that are maybe less in walking distance to Kirkwood bars.  Walking distance is more important to bars than other businesses, because people want to drink but still get home."

bloomington,38easg,Pestilaence,0,Mon Jun 8 13:22:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain that's a useful distinction, ""good"" homeless people vs. ""bad"" homeless people.  Both often suffer from mental health problems.  Both usually have a history of severe developmental challenges, often coming from particularly screwed up situations, domestic abuse/neglect.  Many, many homeless people have substance abuse problems, though it isn't particularly useful or accurate to view these in moralistic terms.  Substance abuse is a disease, and treating it as a disease is empirically the only effective way of dealing with it.  Furthermore, at a certain point of living in really crappy circumstances, self-medicating with drugs is not moral weakness, but the 'healthy' human response that humans, all humans, have to such circumstances.  What firsthand experience with homeless, indigent, otherwise marginalized people has taught me is that for the most part their condition is the result of circumstances, usually either outside their control, or following a logical progression beginning with circumstances outside their control that would require very rare willpower to break.  Essentially, I can't discount the likelihood that I would have done the same things many of the homeless folks I know have done if I had been born into their circumstances.  And I think that goes for most people.  That said, I think the most useful distinction among classes of homeless people in terms of actually devising resources towards their care is permanent vs. temporary.  There are folks who are, as you said, temporarily down on their luck who will, with access to services, pull themselves back out of it.  Then there are folks who simply won't, for lots of reasons.  But in only very few instances do those reasons amount to ""because they're morally bad"".  Usually it's mental illness, substance dependence, etc."

The city has created a situation where other municipalities are physically driving their vagrants and troublemakers to Bloomington, or buying them one-way bus tickets to Bloomington. Bloomington's political leaders are utterly terrified of having provide leadership on the vagrant issue, and therefore have allowed the situation to devolve without creating actual, workable solutions to the problem.  Providing more services isn't the answer. The services here are pretty darn good. What needs to be done is a clear definition between what is and is not allowed activity. Congregating in People's Park? Sure. Using the bathrooms of businesses on Kirkwood and Dunn streets for drugs, sex, and public washing? No, that's not acceptable, and it's certainly not a ""cost"" that needs to be absorbed. Yelling at patrons in sidewalk seating? Also not a ""cost"" that needs to be absorbed.  We can be compassionate to the homeless and still be reasonable with how we handle the relationship."
bloomington,38easg,CarolinaRain,7,Thu Jun 4 18:58:31 2015 UTC,"You're very much indeed correct. The bussing you describe is well known as Greyhound Therapy.  There is a way around this: you offer a carrot and a stick. The carrot is for those homeless who have fallen on bad times, either with joblessness, homelessness, drug addiction (legal or illegal), or psychiatric issues. We can help them, but we only help them when they show that they are willing to do the hard work.  The stick, which will be unpalatable for some here, is for the police to step up enforcement of existing laws. Assault, theft, public urination/defecation is already illegal. Drugs are illegal (although I prefer a sane policy like Portugal's...). Does it shove the criminal element of the homeless away? Yes, it does. But it shoves it to the jails, which limits the impact.  But, the above is predicated that higher amounts of homeless bring in increased amounts of crime disproportionate to apartment and home-holders. Perhaps IU SPEA has more information regarding this.  Now, I come to think: what is the precedent in a city suing another city? I could see the precedent that X city who paid for a non-refundable bus pass was causing socioeconomic damage in the deliberate and targeted transfer of indigent. In other words, We could target cities that use our goodwill against us, and make them pay for it."

I should be able to walk down Kirkwood without the stress of being asked for money and without the fear of retaliation from individuals against whom there is little to no legal recourse."
bloomington,38easg,spirit_spine,5,Thu Jun 4 14:38:46 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing that we're all pretty divided on the issue. I did email Susan Bright to confirm this letter, and she claims that she isn't asserting that crime on Kirkwood Ave has risen in the last three years.   I know this may come as a refutation to my stance on the matter, but it does seem to me that her claims on the issue seem to be contradictory. I did ask for her to provide hard evidence - not anecdotal - of ""bum commerce"" not only affecting her patronage, but also the patronage of other businesses in the area."
bloomington,38easg,briseymo1,7,Thu Jun 4 11:31:46 2015 UTC,"I should clarify.  I posted this not because I disagree that homelessness in Bloomington, and specifically the pressures it puts on Kirkwood, is a problem.    I posted it because I found the tone of the letter and the solutions it hints at deeply troubling.  The tone is pretty derisive to homeless people.  The solution it hints at is increasing police powers to harass the homeless in order to simply push them off of Kirkwood and ""away from our front door"".   If they aren't on Kirkwood, where are they going to go?  Either in to our already overburdened jails or out in to our neighborhoods, which are even more difficult to patrol and keep safe at night.    Furthermore, the way other cities have traditionally accomplished this is by the use of very broad laws that then get selectively applied to society's most vulnerable.  Other cities have passed laws against things like sitting or lying down in public.  This is not something I ever want to see Bloomington do, because vague laws like that always lead to police abuse.    Also, the evidence shows that solutions like this don't fix anything.  We pay more to keep the homeless in jail or in the costs of policing to keep them in check and than we would if we simply built homes for them.  Which is why I support housing first.  Of all the solutions to homelessness, it is the one that seems to actually work.  And in the end, being compassionate and providing homes for people actually ends up costing less money than heavier policing and locking them up.  But it requires that we first view them as people who are merely down on their luck and deserving of help.  Not as troublesome bums and criminals as the tone of this letter would imply.  All of that said, I've since heard from numerous people in the community that I respect that Nick's and its owners are long time supporters of local charities and support services.  It seems likely that this letter was sent out in a moment of frustration and was simply poorly worded.    Nick's actually responded to me on Facebook.  It seems that meeting is open to the public.  I can't attend, but I would encourage other people to do so.  Here's their full response:   Daniel, we are trying to address the issue of aggressive panhandling that leads to a fear of being on Kirkwood. At no point do we believe the homeless are ""bums,"" nor do we believe all of the panhandlers are homeless. If an apology is needed for the word Bum, we offer it. It does not take away from the safety concerns we have for our employees and customers alike. Thank you for the concern and the several compliments in your post. You are invited to join us tomorrow at 3 to hopefully better understand our concerns and point of view."
bloomington,38easg,crankylinuxuser,9,Thu Jun 4 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"I'm Josh Conway. I talked to Susan perhaps an hour ago.  As a bicycle commuter from across 37 to 10th / Bypass, I see a lot. I go through the B Line all times of day and night. I come down Kirkwood regularly. And yes, there is a problem. She's opened up their business as a public forum for all to come.   This isn't a problem that Nick's can solve.  This isn't a problem Bloomington can solve. Nor is this a problem that Indiana can solve.  This problem is institutional across the whole of the US. And positive solutions we do locally will be abused. Look up Greyhound Therapy: other cities will pay for bus tickets to send their destitute and homeless to places that have better services (read: Bloomington).  I sent Susan an email, which I now copy in its entirety. She's invited to read from it and share it. I will post it as a response to this post."
bloomington,38easg,crankylinuxuser,7,Thu Jun 4 17:49:00 2015 UTC,"Greetings Susan Bright,  I've been in the community for quite some time. I work here; I live here; and I do a great amount of commerce here. I'm a member of multiple organizations, and I feel I have a good thumb on the community. I was also an Occupier during the early times, before the group cannibalized themselves. I've seen the homeless, as well as living with them for a time.  If it were easy to paint a broad brush over the homeless, I would. But unfortunately, the reasons why people are homeless are numerous. Many people have just hit hard times, and poverty keeps the strangle-hold on them. While, many others use it as a tool to get what they want. These people choose homelessness.  I believe we can reach the ones who are homeless due to medical issues or hard luck. It will be a great deal to coordinate services and assistance across businesses, but I think if we all come together (as a business community) it will be an easier burden on each of us. We treat this as the carrot. Unfortunately, this carrot will entice many more homeless to migrate here. For that, a stick also needs to be applied. How might this occur? I do not know. I would warn that some of the solutions other larger communities have chosen can be considered unconscionable: sonic weapons, pavement spikes, and the like.    Problems:  Excessive drug usage - deals happening in broad daylight   --- Finding drug paraphernalia in corners and alleys  --- junkies needing their fix turn violent against all who cross them  --- Some homeless are there by choice, choosing homelessness on street for drug use (know handful who actively chose)   Significant homeless are mentally ill and without drugs   --- Drugs could help with getting them on their feet, but many quit soon after getting drugs for various reasons   Violence by homeless   --- have seen assaults and batteries by homeless and vagrants for all sorts of reasons  --- Rapes have allegedly occurred in the tent areas here in B'ton, with no response from police (no reporting)   Nighttime   --- BLine is known for its unsafe passage at night, especially between 10'th to Rogers as well as nearby Seminary Square, and past where Community Kitchen is on corner of Hillside and Rogers  --- Multiple assaults occur where someone may have valuables like bike or food or shoes. I know one who had a needle shivved through his shoulder for his bag.  --- It is difficult for police to respond to incidents on BLine, more so at night.  --- Rev Ernest D Butler park is a hotbed for homeless activity. They are essentially lawless, running their own village under their own rules.     All of these problems leak out across the whole city core, and not just Kirkwood. Kirkwood just happens to have a concentration and cross-section of college students, homeless, and regular people all together. The constant clash between populations cause eruptions of violence as we see, and I believe police can corroborate.  Solutions cannot be too proactive, because they would only increase the number of migrants into B'town. Many times, small cities will pay for bus tickets to get homeless away. See Greyhound Therapy:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-rather/greyhound-therapy-mental-health_b_5275916.html  (Bad solutions)  Laws preventing panhandling - They have been overturned consistently on a 1st amendment basis.  Restrictive laws forbidding homelessness - would push problem to other areas, similar to NIMBY  More shelters - Would only increase # of new migrating vagrants, does not adequately solve the root of homelessness  Anti-homeless spikes - horribly inhumane : http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/02/18/3624021/selfridges-homeless-spikes/  Noise projection - Have loudspeakers play noise to deter homeless from sleeping and loitering in specific areas  (Better solutions)  Increased police presence - funding issues. They could stop across the city core, but money is always tight.  Private security force paid by Kirkwood businesses - Possible, but only for Kirkwood. Would shove problem elsewhere in B'town  Monitoring solutions - outside cameras. Cost a lot, prone to vandalism. Could only act on crimes if they can see people.  (ideal solutions)  Discussion with Shalom Center to determine proactive ways to reduce homelessness - they will have answers we might not have thought of  City agreement to not prosecute homeless with drug problems if they seek treatment; and easy access to free treatment.  Job cooperative - hire people who get help from Shalom center to employment. Can span across B'town businesses.  Community Bike Project assistance - Get homeless transportation for free with time donation, perhaps sponsor agreement possible with Shalom Center?  Section 8 fast track - for those homeless who show responsibility with job and commitments    These are just a few ideas I have that I would like to bring forth to the meeting. However, I am not able to attend.  Best regards, Josh Conway  (edited for reddit clarity)"

The are plenty of kind and awesome homeless people. And many of these crimes were committed by people with homes. Homelessness is the red herring for the crime issue. Don't let judgmental haughty business owners spin the issue into a ""expel the homeless"" issue. Yeah it might help the crime problem, but it won't address it directly. And to sweep all homeless under the rug would victimize some awesome good-hearted people."
bloomington,38easg,CarolinaRain,5,Thu Jun 4 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that a decent number of the people causing trouble along Kirkwood aren't homeless, but rather are low income residents from Bloomington.   And it doesn't appear that the letter was asking to expel the homeless, just to keep them from conducting illegal activities and acting in threatening manners towards people.

As in, the work a human puts out isn't worth the minimum wage.  If you are not doing food service, customer support, or other service related jobs, nor are able to do those (no regular showers), then you are unemployable. Manual labor is mostly gone, and it's not coming back.  If I were you, I'd worry less about Billy there not having a job, and instead worry about your own job being automated. We'll within 20 years see significant inroads on automation of all sorts of careers, including yours (whatever it may be). A minimum income would be a good start for this country."

bloomington,38easg,mikethetechie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:41:05 2015 UTC,"but some are definitely lazy.   And? Right now, our system says ""If you don't work, you don't eat nor will you have a place to live.""   We have more than enough food for everyone. We have more foreclosed and abandoned homes than there are homeless.  I think it's unconscionable to restrict the basics of life when we clearly have plenty. And it's viewpoints like yours (and worse) that we end up with a system that disregards the homeless, the poor, the elderly, and those in the jail system. We have failed them all."
bloomington,38easg,clow_reed,3,Wed Jun 3 20:44:32 2015 UTC,"I actually work for a living and pay taxes. Taxes that contribute to social security, medicare and lots of other welfare services that these fine folks are probably using. How have they contributed? Who is failing here?"
bloomington,38easg,mikethetechie,9,Wed Jun 3 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"You make the assumption that: ""if they have something, I must have less. And if they have less, I will have more.""  This thinking is called a zero sum game. This kind of world is similar to monopoly, where if I have money, it's because I charged you* for it.  We do not live in a zero-sum world. Wealth is created all the time. And once our production of things like food required only a minuscule amount of labor to provide, it should have been up for discussion to provide for all. Instead, the ""Me me me"" attitude pervades.   Intellectually, our world is still so young and greedy. That's why your viewpoint is the majority one; it is the average.    To address your points: I work. I pay my taxes that also contribute to SS, medicare and other services. Your questioning assumes that they have never paid, or that they have not paid ""their fair share"". I beg to differ.  About 12% of the adult homeless population are veterans . And that viewpoint also assumes they have never worked a day in their lives, which I would like for you to prove. Or that they have never bought anything; because taxes are on all non-grocery items.  And to all of it, I say ""SO WHAT? We have enough food to feed 12 earths. And we have 7x as many empty houses as there are homeless. So, WTF are we doing? To appease your sense of ""too bad, fuckem"" ?  I do hope you don't have to live through homelessness, and people harboring the attitude you have shown us. No, wait.. I do hope you have to, so you can get a bit of humbleness on your broad strokes."

If you actually read, and UNDERSTAND what you linked, there is no point in even trying to argue or point this out. I'm going to say this plain and simple; Guns don't kill people, PEOPLE kill people. A gun is a tool... something that is used. It is not the cause of the incident, it is the function through which the tool was used. Place a gun in a room, and yell obscenities at it... push it, shove it, tell it that it's a worthless piece of crap. Hell, even kick it! What's the outcome of this? Absolutely nothing!   If you actually read the information that you linked, you would find the below; ""In 2010, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 67% of all homicides in the U.S. were conducted using a firearm.""  That's 67%. What about the 33%? Were those homicides committed using a knife? A baseball bat? Bare fists? What about vehicles? Does that mean that we need to ban all of those items too??? Fuck it, we may as well ban forks for making people fat!!!!!! This analogy (forks making people fat, vs people dying from firearms being present) is the exact same thing... both items are tools, and it's up to the owner to use either one responsibly. The issue here is not the weapon, it's the person!    Did you also read, from the links that YOU gave, that... ""61% of all gun-related deaths in the U.S. are suicides."" Now hold your horses... Holy crap... Does that mean that no one went out of their way to kill this individual, except the individual himself???? Wow, what could that mean? This statistic is included in the number of annual, gun-related deaths.  What about this tidbit of information? ""Gun violence is most common in poor urban areas and frequently associated with gang violence..."" Does this mean that we need to ban poor urban area's? Maybe we should just say that you're not allowed to live in the US, unless you make $80,000 a year. That sounds like it should help.  How about this section; ""Although mass shootings have been covered extensively in the media, mass shootings account for a small fraction of gun-related deaths[4] and the frequency of these events had steadily declined between 1994 and 2007.""  It goes on to say; ""Between 2007 and 2013, however, the rate of active shooter incidents per year in the US has increased.[9][10] Hand guns figured in the Virginia Tech massacre, Binghamton shootings, 2009 Fort Hood shooting, Oikos University shooting, and 2011 Tucson shooting. The Aurora theater shooting and the Columbine High School massacre were committed by assailants armed with multiple weapons.""  The above mentioned shootings mostly happen on college campuses, or other area's where firearms are very typically forbidden. I would wager that if there were more RESPONSIBLE, gun carrying people, incidents like that would either not happen, or the outcome would have been significantly less. I'll come back to this point in a moment.  Read over the information in this wiki; http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_Switzerland#Gun_crime  Here are some snip-its from that page. ""Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20""  Almost every citizen of the country, specifically males going through military training though, are TRAINED on how to PROPERLY use firearms.  ""Government statistics for the year 2010[19] records 40 homicides involving firearms, out of the 53 cases of homicide in 2010."" Wait... the entire country had 53 deaths in 2010???? That's it? And, on top of that, only 40 of them were gun-related???  ""The annual rate of homicide by any means per 100,000 population was 0.70, which is one of the lowest in the world."" Hmmm... let's take a look at that. This means that for every roughly 130,000 people, ONE is killed SOMEHOW (through the use of any means). This is also one of the absolutely lowest homicide rates in the world... and yet, Switzerland has one of the highest per-capita rates of gun ownership. Take into consideration that almost everyone there is TRAINED, and knows exactly how to use their firearm. Hm, does military training make them more dangerous? Are they going to commit more crimes, because they know what they are doing??? The answer is no, and quite the opposite actually.  ""However, the annual rate of homicide by guns per 100,000 population was 0.52, which is higher than neighboring countries."" This number is still insanely low, compared to statistics from the US. Why? The people using the tools makes all the difference.   You absolutely need to understand this, and do your research before trying to make a stand against something."
bloomington,38fnxr,cherrybomb921,-2,Thu Jun 4 15:13:42 2015 UTC,"No, a gun alone doesn't kill someone. But guns aren't just sitting in rooms, doing nothing but being shouted at by some lunatic as the scenario you are trying to use to prove that guns are harmless. That's a stupid analogy at best.  Should we just get rid of all the locks on our doors because people should be responsible and not rob other people? People should be responsible and not shoot other people. Well, I'll be damned. That's insightful. If it worked America wouldn't have such a huge gun violence problem that needs an extensive Wikipedia page about it.  If you're going to compare the situation in other countries you may want to look at how they are doing as a country because poverty is directly correlated with violent crime. Switzerland has about a 3% poverty level while America's level is 5 times that or more.   It is concluded that poverty and income inequality are each associated with violent crime. The analysis, however, shows considerable variation in the estimated size of the relationships and suggests that homicide and assault may be more closely associated with poverty or income inequality than are rape and robbery.   http://cjr.sagepub.com/content/18/2/182.short?rss=1&ssource=mfc  I don't think gangsters are particularly interested in responsible gun ownership. In those cases I don't trust people to be responsible with their weapons.  It's easier to stand from a distance and shoot your target than it is to walk up to someone and stab them. Accessibility to weapons allows those that may not otherwise commit a crime to do it. I bet there'd be a lot fewer drive bys if we only had knives.  But what you're really hoping is that you can trust other people enough to ""be responsible"" with their weapons. I can barely trust the drive through guy to not mess up my order and you think I want to trust them with a deadly weapon. You're sadly mistaken.  If you want to fight gun violence you need to start with fighting poverty. Better education about handling weapons won't dont shit if you have people running around intending to use those weapons to kill people."
bloomington,38fnxr,Pestilaence,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:26:17 2015 UTC,"Look, you're clearly ignorant to numerous facts. Your main points in the above post are that we should now fight poverty, and that you acknowledge that firearms are tools; You just made my case for me.  If we ""ban"" weapons like this, that doesn't mean they are going to completely vanish. They aren't going to magically disappear. If someone wants to acquire a firearm bad enough, they will do it through any means necessary. Allowing firearms on the other hand, and keeping them registered and tracked is much better than having them banned. This only creates a higher demand for them for those that don't mind acquiring them through illegals means; This is simple economics. Do we need to tighten up the screening and background checks, in order to procure one? Maybe, sure. Should we also increase the severity of punishment for crimes commited whilst using a firearm! I think so, only because they used a tool that made the crime much easier. This however, doesn't mean that that weapons of this nature are inherently evil at all.   ""Should we just get rid of all the locks on our doors because people should be responsible and not rob other people?"" You're simply making another one of my points valid. We may as well start with something smaller, to ease people into the whole mass-banning idea though. Let's go back to my idea and ban forks. In the US, 9.3% of people have diabetes. We need to help fight that off, so away with forks it is.   Also, where I grew up (outside the US), we ALWAYS left our doors unlocked. Crime was incredibly low, even petty thefts. You almost never heard of a murder, and the worst thing on the news was the local sports team lost in the finals. Also taking into consideration, the poverty levels were slightly less, but overall quite close. So yes, I will, in fact, stick by my idea that people need to become more responsible for their actions.  You will also ALWAYS have those that are not responsible. Those that feel they are above the law, or those that harbor hate. However, I believe that if we trained and armed every law-abiding righteous citizen, the amount of drastic, far-ended crimes would drop significantly. Would you want to take the chance and go on a shooting spree, when you know that every single person you see is carrying, and is more than proficient at using their weapon? That they could lawfully stop you from committing any more serious crimes, or worse, killing any more innocents?  You clearly do not know how many lives guns SAVE, as well. Did you know that in the US alone... ""as many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against assault, rape, or worse...""  ""To the woman whose clothes are about to be torn from her body by a knife-wielding rapist in a deserted parking lot, a handgun in the purse is a lifeline. It is a genuine equalizer that may mean the difference between her life and her death. It gives her a chance when she otherwise would have none.""  ""WHEN AN ARSONIST lights a match that burns a building, is the match at fault? Are match manufacturers responsible for the fire? Should laws be passed prohibiting you from having and using matches, or restricting which types you can have, and in what quantities?  The obvious answer to these questions is no. The same match that is misused by the arsonist lights the fireplace that warms us, and the stove that feeds us. The match has no mind of its own. It is not an evil invention. Its purpose is to ignite, nothing more. If it is misused, the solution is to punish the individual wrongdoer. Everyone else should be left alone.  The same is true of firearms"" http://www.bachbio.com/gunsavelives.htm  ""...that more lives are saved than lost by the firearms Americans acquire to protect themselves and their property. The N.R.A. emphasized that claim in a two-page newspaper advertisement attacking TIME for its report ((July 17)) on 464 gun deaths that occurred in the U.S. in a single week, chosen at random. ""Legally-owned firearms saved the lives of far more Americans than those lost during ((TIME's)) 'seven deadly days,' "" the advertisement stated. ""According to noted criminologist Dr. Gary Kleck of Florida State University, every year some 650,000 Americans use firearms to thwart criminal assault. That's 12,500 a week."" http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,152446,00.html  Do you understand that number? That's 12,500 attacks PER WEEK on people that felt their life was threatened, and used their constitutional right to carry a firearm, and to protect themselves from danger, with said tool.  The article goes on to say; ""Kleck says his study did not consider the question of lives saved. Nor did he conclude, as the N.R.A. claims, that a crime or an assault had been ""thwarted"" in each of his estimated 645,000 (the ad upped it to 650,000) annual instances of a protective use of a gun. Kleck notes that his study may have included incidents in which a homeowner merely heard noisy youths outside his house, then shouted, ""Hey, I've got a gun!"" and never saw any possible attacker.  Still, Kleck estimates that an assailant or the defender actually fired a handgun in nearly half the cases. If so, 322,000 incidents each year involved great danger, and the potential victims credited their guns with protecting them. That is about ten times the number who die from guns annually in the U.S. ""It is possible that guns save more lives than they cost,"" Kleck says."" http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,152446,00.html"

It's the honest truth, showing that the tool through which a murder or assault is committed, it not the one at fault; It's the person behind the tool.   I mentioned this, because people don't understand why guns don't need to be banned. It also goes along with what I said about other weapons... do we ban knives, baseball bats.... our own fists?  I don't believe what I said was a flawed mantra at all, but feel free to elaborate your thoughts on this."
bloomington,38fnxr,arstin,2,Mon Jun 8 13:19:07 2015 UTC,"It's the honest truth   It's also the honest truth that grenade launchers don't kill people. chemical weapons don't kill people. surface-to-air missiles don't kill people. By your logic these and every other piece of military hardware should be made available to civilians.   ""X doesn't kill people"" appeals to some perceived universal truth about personal responsibility. But if there is a single tool, in all of existence, that is dangerous enough to be banned, than the whole mantra falls apart. And it does - some tools simply need to be regulated or banned. The debate is always going to be about where the utility and danger of a tool place it on this continuum."

I don't really want a full-blown rifle range right next to the city, but it's pretty silly that we don't even have a basic indoor pistol range even reasonably close. We don't even have dedicated gun stores in the city anymore.   I'm a liberal guy too, but come on, this is Indiana. Drive five minutes into Greene County on any given day and you can hear rifle cracks echoing through the hills. Anyone who lives outside of city limits can shoot on their own property all they want. The city council can do more productive things than trying in vain to exorcise all the guns from Bloomington..."

bloomington,38fnxr,grantyou3wishes,4,Thu Jun 4 16:50:49 2015 UTC,You can shoot in Hoosier National Forest but it's not 1.5 hours away. You just take 3rd St east and turn left on 446. You go past the Lake Monroe by about 6 miles or so and you can shoot on the left. Takes about 15-20 minutes to get there.
bloomington,38fnxr,LiveMas2016,2,Fri Jun 5 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"I can second this. Have pistol but have not shot there. I live near 446 in town, so it's only about a 15 minute drive until I'm deep enough in the woods to shoot. It's no real range, but if you want to toss a few shells downrange this might be the easiest way to do it."
bloomington,38fnxr,oO0-__-0Oo,3,Wed Jun 10 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"Atterbury is your best bet.   There are some places that are closer, but they require memberships which are relatively pricey.   There USED to be several ranges on campus, but they got closed down after Columbine..."
bloomington,38fnxr,oO0-__-0Oo,2,Thu Jun 4 03:08:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured I would just bite the bullet (lololol get it?) and make the drive out there every once in a while. Maybe bring some buddies, make a mini trip out of it. It looks like a nice range, and cheap too.  You wouldn't happen to have any recommendations on local gun stores too, would you? I've never purchased a firearm before, so I'm not even sure what to look out for."
bloomington,38fnxr,CrispCrew,4,Thu Jun 4 03:14:11 2015 UTC,"Sure. There are several decent ones around, but the consensus is that Bradis Guns is the best shop in the state. They have a very large selection, very good staff, and good prices. Located HERE About a 45 minute drive from Btown. In town, there's MC Sports. Pretty good selection. Ok prices. It's good for a box store.   As far as a firearm, if you are going army and want to do anything combat related, you should get handy with the AR/M4 platform. You could learn to build a gun (see: /r/guns) or get a pre-built. Right now the market is really cheap for building your own, but depends on how much time and trouble you want to put into it. If you are considering ever doing something like Ranger School, you might as well get really familiar with the platform (and hit the gym while you're at it). Hopefully DOD'll toss those old POS M9's before you have to mess with them.... LOL. Unlikely, though.   If you feel like springing the dough, there's a range where a lot of military and ex-mil guys shoot called 'Panther Ridge Training Center' out near Solsberry, run by a gun named Jeremiah Barthold. He's ex-military (he was an army drill sergeant IIRC) and has done a good share of combat (in the service and as a contractor). There's a good long range for distance rifle, and a shorter range for shooting steel and paper targets. Good deal if you want to train a lot, and get real practice and training in. You can run and gun and create your own courses, especially if no one else is there, which you can coordinate with them if you want to do so. I think a membership is running about $300 per year nowadays - and it's about a 40 minute drive over there from the west side of town, so quite a bit closer than most other options. There are some other guys who work and train out at Panther Ridge who are extremely knowledgeable and experienced operators. They are the real deal. You have to do a background check to get some of the training out there.  Atterbury is, by comparison, very constrained as to what you can do on the range. No rapidfire. No target transitions. No drawing from a holster. No shooting on the go. Etc."

I have had some success on https://www.armslist.com I wouldn't recommend doing that without a fair amount of knowledge, since there are scammers there, just like on CraigsList.  I think I saw that Rural King is selling the Glock 19 (9mm) Gen 4 for under $500 pre tax. Not sure how long the sale lasts or if it's available in BTown.

bloomington,38fnxr,youdontknowdick,3,Thu Jun 4 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"I tend to browse Slickguns.com as well when checking out prices. A lot of times, that site will have much better prices on firearms than you can find anywhere around here.  And, while I don't know them very well, the guys at Bloomington HPSS (Home protection security service, I think) seem pretty decent, and they do $20 transfers. They have a registered FFL, and have dealt with a ton of purchase sites before. Just purchase the weapon, have it shipped to them, and give them a call to let them know it's coming in."

bloomington,38fnxr,youdontknowdick,2,Thu Jun 4 10:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know SVGC moved, but that property was still a range, and could have been used by a university club. My understanding is that when Columbine occurred, any possibility of using it for university activities was nixed.   IIRC the range under the union was completely deconstructed just recently, even though it sat dormant (but extant) for about 15 years."
bloomington,38fnxr,oO0-__-0Oo,2,Thu Jun 4 13:05:04 2015 UTC,"It's days as a range ended when SVGC and BPD both were asked to move. Because of the apartments built behind the ranges, the liability was considered too high for IU to allow the land to be used for gun ranges. It was supposed to become part of the IU golf course and another access road. This was all decided in '96 after a land usage study as well as the apartment dwellers bitching about the range. The fate of the range was never based on anything to do with Columbine."

bloomington,388q7d,hamfriend,5,Wed Jun 3 01:40:44 2015 UTC,"I worked with one of the low income legal services organizations, and did a little work/have some experience with the others available in town.  Indiana Legal Services operates a firm model, doing intake and handling clients in-house.  You can google them to see what their intake process is.  They're LSC-funded, so they generally help with different legal issues, up to 200% of the federal poverty guidelines for some kinds of issues, usually up to 150% of the federal poverty guidelines for a lot of non-bankruptcy consumer law.  ILS tends to be more selective, but if you do get staffed the representation will be competent and prompt.  District 10 Pro Bono is another legal services organizations funded by Indiana's IOLTA funding.  What they do is attempt to place cases with local attorneys at no cost, or sometimes sliding cost.  They have about the same funding guidelines as ILS, maybe slightly less selective for consumer law issues, but the wait can be long- you're essentially waiting for a volunteer to take your case.  Generally speaking, neither organization will take your case if it's fee generating, which means if there is a potential damages judgment against your parents.  If you're looking to get made whole from your parents, you might need to check out a private bar attorney.  If you're just looking to fix your credit, one of those orgs might help.  What I would recommend as a first step is to check out Counsel In The Court, which is a program affiliated with D10 that brings a couple of volunteer attorneys down to the Monroe County Justice Building (301 N. College) for a walk-in advice clinic.  Their consumer law clinic is in the afternoon, 1:00-3:30, and they usually have a couple consumer law attorneys on hand.  They can at least get you started, point you in the right direction if your case is potentially fee generating.  And you get to actually talk to a licensed attorney for advice that day.  Student Legal Services is pretty good if you're an IU student, but their expertise tends to be in stuff that is common occurrence for students, like landlord/tenant law.  I don't know that they don't have consumer law expertise, but I also don't know if they do."

Here is a link which you may have seen about IU EMS.  http://iuhealth.org/bloomington/emergency-services/ambulance-services/  Assuming you are getting the NREMT, you may have to contact the Indiana DHS and get your Indiana cert as well.

You are correct, I am getting the NREMT. I didn't think about the state certification issue until you brought it up though, so that's always fun. I'll have to look into it!

It's small, but a great fit with Kelley programs and a way to make your resume stand out among all the other Kelley grads. Or, look into the Economics program at IU -- there's one outside of Kelley that is pretty good, and then you could easily double-major in Chinese. (Source: used to work for the Flagship programs. If you want more info on this type of option, send me a PM!)"
bloomington,384bkc,tainted_crimson,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"I work in the Kelley School of Business, but I didn't attend Kelley. So my opinions might be off from people who aren't being paid to work there.   I think it is a wonderful school with passionate and knowledgeable teachers. It is tough and challenging, but so many companies like EY, Cummins, PWC etc will hire people almost exclusively because of the fact that you have a Kelley degree.   I love Bloomington, and lots of local businesses give internships and student projects to Kelley that are really involved. Housing prices are mostly based on proximity to the school: the closer you live, the higher the cost. But it isn't a town where only rich international can afford. Over 30,000 students have figured out housing that aren't rich international students."
bloomington,384bkc,thatonechickshescool,0,Tue Jun 9 12:13:48 2015 UTC,"I don't have enrollment figures in front of me, but Kelley is one of the main draws for international (read: Korean/Japanese/Chinese/Indian) students from wealthy backgrounds. That's not a bad thing, just know it's gonna be a very different demographic from Ivy Tech in Indy.   That's also the driving reason behind my second point: Renting in Bloomington is a goddamn nightmare. Over the past ten or fifteen years, there as been a huge boom in apartment development, but it ALL caters exclusively to wealthy foreigners who don't blink at paying exorbitant rents (and leasing a McClaren...) for their kid to live in Bloomington and go to Kelley. Median rent is around $900. It's the most expensive place to live in Indiana. Nobody has spent a dime building affordable housing in years. There are basically no residents living downtown anymore because the rich students have pushed them all out.  So, you're gonna pay a ton of money to live here whether you're in a luxury student apartment downtown or a roach-infested room in a rental house that hasn't seen maintenance since Reagan."
bloomington,384bkc,Used-Car-Salesman,3,Mon Jun 1 20:05:05 2015 UTC,There are plenty of places to live that are in between the two extremes you described. The east side is filled with affordable and livable appartments and the southside has great houses to live in as well. You just have to be a little more dilligent in your housing search.
bloomington,384bkc,geechan,3,Tue Jun 2 01:15:10 2015 UTC,"Eastside and southside do have affordable and livable apartments (think Regency)... but you need a bus or transportation to get anywhere important in decent time.  On the flipside, there are a few great deals you can find living closer to campus or downtown that would be sub $600, $500 total and sometimes lower if you're lucky or don't mind sharing a bathroom amongst four people.   Bicycle apartments on Madison / 4th are an example of decent price and location as are some word of mouth landlords. And also the co-op places if you don't mind living with 10 other people.   I could never fathom living over at The Village, The Dillon, or worst - Copper Beach just because of distance, although they all supply shuttles."

bloomington,384bkc,NerdusMaximus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:42:25 2015 UTC,"I lived on the north side during grad school and did not have their experience at all. My rent was $465 at its highest for a one bedroom. The place was kept up SO nicely and freshly painted/re-carpeted when I moved in. I lived there from 2012-2014 with no problems. It was also right on the A-bus route that went straight to my school and right past the Kelley school. Downside was naturally football season, but it doesn't take a lot of effort to plan around.  Living downtown is dumb, in my opinion. It's overpriced and not actually convenient to most of campus or anything except places to eat. If you're only looking downtown and at new apartment buildings, you're going to have a bad time."

Now if we hear from the guy who owns the open jeep that must be drenched, I'll be so impressed. Can you imagine what he must think if he shows up after it is fixed? There was another car, red, under the spray on the other side of the road as well, I think. I was thinking I would be freaked if either were mine.

I'm a huge animal lover but it felt amazing to get involved and hit the ground running.  Every Sunday I walked up to 20-25 dogs, occasionally helped clean kennels and feed them, but mostly it was Sundays filled with dog walks, playing with puppies, and riding that high for a week until the next Sunday.  The people are amazing, they are so invested and do whatever they can to keep volunteers involved with all sorts of events and activities. I moved to Chicago and I can't find any where that will let me be as hands on with the animals so it's an opportunity afforded at smaller shelters I guess.  Bloomington Animal Shelter is amazing too but they are bursting at the seams with volunteers.  BCHS needs people desperately and you won't regret it.    I also have friends who work/volunteer at Bell Trace which I was always tempted to participate with but I'm a sucker for dogs :D"

I have friends in that area that love it, and if I was looking to move into the south side that's where I would go too.    If you are looking for further south I would recommend the neighborhoods around Olcott Park right off of Sare and Rhorer road.  Those have a definite upper middle class feel to them, newer  larger houses than other places in town and more removed from the rest of the town.  I've only ever ran or driven through that area, but it seems nice enough and I would definitely check it out if I were looking.  And of course there is the Bryan Park neighborhood.  That area and directly east of it are incredibly nice but super sought after and so hard to find good housing in.

Great school district, and it's a pretty nice neighborhood - quiet, and the houses are spaced farther apart than what we've seen in some of the newer developments. The houses are predominantly older, but every one we've looked at has been kept up really well.   The downside is that they are a little pricier per sq. ft. than what you would find in other places (like the Highlands), and they don't stay on the market long since it's a pretty desirable area.   OP: If you don't know where it is, it's south of Winslow east of Walnut St. Pike (basically, across Winslow from the YMCA entrance).

Bloomington has lots of great restaurants and bars, for starters. Exploring them would be fun I think.  If you're into activity and the outdoors there are plenty of opportunites for hiking, etc around several of the lakes around here.   Several of the restaurants actually sponsor running and cycling groups if you're into that.  The city hosts various festivals pretty regularly (most notably Lotus and the Fourth Street festival) so I would track down a source for that so you can go to the ones you're interested in!   There's a great farmer's market every Saturday morning in the spring, summer, and fall (there is also a winter one but I've never been to it).  If I were you, I would just set aside a few hours one day to wander around the downtown area and explore.

Spreading the word of dishonest people, such as this article, and posting, is probably the best way to deal with small time scammers.

bloomington,3626tr,clearlybeloved,2,Sat May 16 14:46:16 2015 UTC,Zing IS super consistent. My old place of business sold the cold brew and we bought gallon buckets of it. That shit will last over a year.

This is where they bake all the bread/bagels and make all the cookies and miscelleny that they sell. it is also where they have their main offices for bookkeeping.  While I was working there Greg and Lyle (the owners) had a secretary named Sarah (I'm not sure what her last name was, it was long ago) who did all of the bookkeeping for the corporation while Greg and Lyle jet setted around or micromanaged their businesses.  Sarah got diagnosed with leukemia.  Sarah had worked for the Scholar's Inn for YEARS and did ALL of the bookkeeping.  Sarah spent the rest of her life working at the bakehouse as they would not give her medical leave. Meanwhile her teenage daughter started working overnights packaging bread to help cover medical bills.  They did nothing to help them, they just let that poor woman work herself to death.  Also Greg was cheating on his wife with the pasty chef.  TL/DR:Stay the fuck away."

He doesn't come in all that often.  As for the actual management, as long as you're actually making an effort, people are cool there. The GM is a pretty swell guy, cares a lot about the customers and even more about his employees. Things can get pretty stressful during peak hours (Little 5 weekend was a pain in the ass) but as I said, as long as you're putting an effort into your job, it's a pretty fun job. Right now is probably the best time to apply, students are gone, professors are going on vacation, so it's not as busy. It's worth a shot and you can always find something else if you don't like it.

bloomington,3564gl,The_Incredulous_Hulk,2,Thu May 7 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"I read something a while back about liquor retailers actively lobbying against Sunday sales. As it is now, people know to buy their Sunday beer on Saturday, and the store doesn't have to pay operational costs on Sundays. If Sunday sales were a thing, those Saturday sales would be spread over Saturday and Sunday, but the stores would have to pay staff for two days instead of one.   Major chains like as Walmart and Target would love to have sales on Sunday, since their stores are already open. It would increase their profits without having to increase costs, while simultaneously hurting their competition.   Edit: It isn't the one I mentioned, but this article is a pretty recent example of what's been going on for a while."
bloomington,3564gl,howerrd,2,Thu May 7 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much the reason, though my argument is that if liquor stores are so hard up that they need to actively lobby to keep Sunday sales off the books because it'll ruin them, then maybe they shouldn't be in business."

Newby is at the west side office and she's quick and nice but hard to schedule with.

Water is included in the rent, so you don't have to worry about that RUBS BS. Electric usually runs me about $50. Gas stove, water heater, and furnace.

If you're anything like me, you work during the day and go out at night, which leaves little time for any of that to matter.  A few of the staff live in the complex, so monkey-business doesn't really fly.

bloomington,34dlke,sentry360,5,Thu Apr 30 08:03:52 2015 UTC,"After reading through the kick starter it sounds very interesting. I am curious though how they can present all of these languages accurately and avoid the issue something like say Google translate has where it will translate incorrectly. With mining this much information about so many languages how can we, as a user base, be assured that what we will be learning is in fact correct? Also, how will it compare to apps such as duolingo in terms of learning structure? How will you stand out in the market, is it simply having more languages and can you back up that this truly does work as a teaching method? I'm very excited about this as duolingo doesn't have an option for Japanese which is the language I took years ago and would like to relearn or refresh."
bloomington,34dlke,srslyunkewl,4,Thu Apr 30 09:48:57 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm Marc, the founder. Several questions there. And sentry360 shared a few relevant points. 1) We mine existing content. We then correct that content. The goal is to move toward greater quality over time, and have it properly indicated along the way. The methods Serhiy mentioned are relevant, and seem to be working. So with words, we have various native speakers or people with the relevant degrees making sure the content we mine is accurate. Importantly, content will be flagged as to whether it has been improved or not. And it is your material, not ours. 2) We aren't a translator. For sentence problems this is really important, because Google has given itself an infinitely bigger task. GT must provide a translation for any possible sentence. George Carlin had a joke about this, he provided a sentence that had never been said before (I won't repeat the sentence). This is not just a theoretical possibility. Many sentences you type every day have never been typed before. So Openwords only needs an apparently infinite pile of sentences. So for example, if we had one million English-Japanese sentence translation problems.. That isn't infinite. But if a Japanese learner is getting them one-by-one, I'm not sure the learner could tell the difference. And we can mine open Japenese-English sentence translations. 3) Finally, and this is my favorite part. We will have a default curricula - and it has a learning method (common stuff first, nothing radical here). But, the main thing we are doing is providing autonomy. Starting with you can choose what words you want to learn or others can build curricula for you. We aren't tyrants here, and we don't think we know better than someone with a masters degree in teaching Swahili. We want that person to be able to express different ideas. That is my favorite part!"
bloomington,34dlke,sphenophyte,3,Thu Apr 30 11:18:31 2015 UTC,"Also, please consider giving us support, We definitely already have Japanese well on its way. A former graduate student from IU is working on the Japanese db. Japanese may actually be the first language for which we have both many words problems & sentence problems. Even $1 and a comment on our page raises our standing."
bloomington,34dlke,sphenophyte,3,Thu Apr 30 11:21:13 2015 UTC,"I might be a bit off, so I'll invite Marc, the founder, to review what I say and chime in. I doubt he's awake right now though so I'll answer this as best I can.  In short, by leveraging crowd-sourcing.  In details, by scraping content such as Wiktionary which already has a large, and growing, repository of words thanks to crowd-sourcing. The word database will also be open and available to everyone, so that everyone from the hobby linguist at home to the computational linguist at a university can make use of it; and make corrections in the process.  Other language learning apps tend to keep this data locked down so as to prevent competition. This also creates a huge cost burden and limits public contribution. The goal is that with enough public and private contribution, this word repository will grow in size and quality (so as to not teach the wrong thing) to match and surpass the competition. Similar to how certain open source projects, like Linux, FireFox, Chrome, have grown to not only compete with, but surpass proprietary technologies many ways.  I'm not too familiar with the teaching method, my interest lies heavily with the word database, so my answer may be not only limited, but a bit distorted. Hopefully Marc can come on here and answer that at some point."

bloomington,33g2jb,ilikecaramelapplepop,5,Wed Apr 22 05:54:55 2015 UTC,"It seems that it will be a fairly tight race - Neher seems to know people, he teaches at Kelley, and he's on City Council. He uses his connections in the town to his advantage, and enjoys the name recognition. However, Hamilton is more personable, down-to-earth, and has run for mayor before, so he's been around the block a few times. He also has headed large, multi-million/billion dollar organizations, and has spent his life working for the arts, for social projects, and for sustainability in government and community. Hamilton is also supported by some of the most progressive and innovative leaders and organizations in the town, including Tomilea Allsion, who was the first woman mayor, and who developed the Canopy of the Lights, helped make Bloomington a Tree City USA, and who encouraged and promoted the Parks Department.   I think that the fact that Neher is a Republican running under the guise of a Democrat will alienate many people who would have otherwise voted for him - after all, the public doesn't like being blatantly lied to. Neher also is hesitant to state his true beliefs concerning governmental programs - he is riddled with political jargon, and honestly, he doesn't say much when he talks: he sort of just spews meaningless buzz words. This frightens me, as I fear he is trying to get votes, and will be a more conservative mayor than the people of Bloomington truly desire.   Linnemeier, the third candidate, adds another interesting dimension. I am interested to see if he will steal votes from either of the other candidates - its hard to tell. He is largely running on decriminalizing marijuana. He is an interesting character, and certainly a fun guy to be around.   Only time will tell, but early voting in the primary is the best way for the City of Bloomington to shape the election, and decide the best mayor for us."

It is just amazing at how gullible people are when they listen to candidates - especially when one candidate in particular fails to ever say anything, and who is so condescending when he speaks with and to the voters. Neher purposely remains ambiguous during debates, because he knows his true positions on issues wouldn't be well-received to the Bloomington audience. Neher is also a teacher at Kelley School of Business which allows him the public-speaking experience, as well as the charisma to charm like-minded, business students. Not to mention that during every debate I have watched, Neher has laughed often at Linnemeier nearly every time he answers a question, which is offensive, as it automatically demeans what Linnemeier was saying."

bloomington,33f4zg,handsopen,11,Wed Apr 22 00:41:22 2015 UTC,"YES!! YES!! I KNOW!!  So back when I lived in Bloomington I was obsessed with finding out. Once we asked Pizza X and all they told us was that it was Hidden Valley Buttermilk dressing, so we immediately went to Kroger to get some but it just wasn't the same.   Then another time we were at Mother Bear's and their ranch is pretty much the same so we asked them and turns out they make it from the ranch powder that you can get at like GFS or Sam's club or what have you. So I went to GFS and bought the supplies and literally that night made 5 gallons of the most perfect ranch you've ever had.   Then I realized you don't have to make 5 gallons at a time and you can just go to any grocery store and get those Ranch dip packets (it doesn't even have to be Hidden Valley) and mix them with 1 cup mayo and 1 cup buttermilk (buttermilk is KEY, use regular milk and it will taste like the bottled stuff). That's it! I've tested it on multiple Bloomington friends and they all agree it's the same!"
bloomington,33f4zg,swever,7,Wed Apr 22 05:48:55 2015 UTC,"I make my own buttermilk ranch and blue cheese dressings all the time.  I found that the 1:1 ratio of mayo:buttermilk is too much.  I like to make it a bit thicker, more like outback or texas roadhouse.  I usually use around 1 cup of mayo and 4 Tbsp of buttermilk with the packet of ranch.  Throw in a small pinch of cyan pepper and fresh ground black pepper (just a touch) for a slight zing on the tongue.  It's delicious.  The 1:1 ratio is too ""wet"" and liquid for me.  I like my dressing a little more thick and about 4Tbsp of buttermilk for every cup of mayo is about right.  I actually don't use the whole packet either, just about 3/4 of it.  Then I add in a little onion powder and a half of a chopped up clove of fresh garlic (you could substitute about 1/4 tsp of powdered garlic, but it's not as zangy as fresh).  People comment how delicious my ranch is.  :)  My wife says it's her favorite and very close to what the Outback makes.  You have to let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before using.  It tastes better the longer it cools."
bloomington,33f4zg,CornFedCritic,3,Wed Apr 22 12:23:24 2015 UTC,"For me it's the water-y ness that I actually prefer. It perfectly coats the pizza when you dip it or the salad if you shake it all up, but yea that part is mostly personal preference! Though I find Pizza X leans on the watery side aka the 1:1 ratio.  I am intrigued by your ingredient additions though and am totally going to start experimenting with that now as well! And yes - the longer in the fridge the better! forgot that part :)"

bloomington,33czn2,smelsiehacker,5,Tue Apr 21 15:02:40 2015 UTC,You can just go buy a kombucha from somewhere and dump that into a batch of ready to ferment kombucha and it'll form it's own. I'd recommend a plain or one flavored the same as the batch you're making. Any brand should do you as long as it's not pasteurized.  Edited: removed specific store recommendation

Honestly, I don't think there's any breakfast worth getting on its own—you can make anything better at home. That being said, I like Rainbow Bakery's pastries (and I'm not vegan!) and the stuff at the farmers' market, though that's pushing it. I've only been to Hopscotch once, but I like the atmosphere. Rachel's isn't as good, but I again like the atmosphere. Bloomington Bagel Company is pretty good and cheap, but cheaper if you get it at a grocery.  People swear by Lucky Express on third, by the Turkish place. I'm not sold. I like Rush Hour Station better; it's the only place that you can get a decent Bahn Mi in Indiana, as far as I can tell (still waiting for tacos as good as you can get in Hammond in Bloomington, though. I'm living in the Bay Area now- there's just no Mexican in town that's worth it, but I'm a huge snob.)   Go to an Asian place with lots of Asians and get noodles; they're usually pretty cheap.  Laughing Planet makes alright, hippie (not Mexican) burritos.  I do love Dats. Probably the best filling cheap food in town, and I do love the sweet tea. There's never anyone in there, either.  People like that hotdog place on the other side of the highway to Indianapolis. It's cheap, but it's out of the way… and it's a hotdog. The Chocolate Moose has dank as ice cream and their hotdogs are pretty good, too.  The Euro Deli south of town is a Russian/general eastern European grocery with a sandwich bar. It's cheap as hell, and you can get kvass there.  But honestly, the best option is Hinkle's Hamburgers out west of town. I've never seen students or even a ton of IU/lefty/bougie townies—it's a real Hoosier place, with the crispy patties that Steak-n-Shake tries and fails to deliver. This shit is the real fucking deal.

It only lasted one night but something like 8 cars were broken into. One of he cars, my coworker's Honda Civic, had a really nice sound system stolen.   Here's where the story gets really good. The coworker of mine, a native Ugandan, decides to scour Craigslist. Sure enough, he finds his, or what appear to be his, speakers for sale. So, he sets up a meeting, drives a different car over, etc. Sees the speaker/sound system just sitting there on the kitchen table. Coworker examines it, sort of plays with the nobs a bit, makes note of the serial  numbers. Finally tells the guy he wants to buy it and says he needs to go to an ATM first, but what he really did was drive to a gas station and called the police. He had already filled out a police report the night his car was broken into.   A few minutes later, two or three squad cars rolled into the seller's driveway. Speaker system retrieved.

bloomington,330d0m,sentry360,6,Sat Apr 18 07:10:47 2015 UTC,"Municipal broadband is a good idea theoretically, but it is a can of worms that presents a lot of problems that are hard to resolve. Our neighborhood (Blue Ridge) recently looked into this and found that owning the network was not something we wanted to get into. Is the issue that people want municipally owned telecommunications infrastructure or that they just want better competition (read: fiber) in the marketplace? Those are two different questions.  I don't think most municipalities have the expertise or political will to get into the ISP business. Having a city or town own its own telecommunications infrastructure sounds nice, but it would require a whole department to maintain and service it (just as with the water and sewer lines). You could outsource that work to the ISP servicing the network, but then how much money would you really save versus the ISP building the network and taking on all the risk themselves?  The fact is that most telecommunications infrastructure in the US is owned and controlled by the companies that have built it. In Bloomington, your copper phone lines are owned by AT&T and your coaxial cable is owned by Comcast. These companies control those lines and the laws don't allow competing ISPs access to them. This was not always the case though. It used to be you could purchase DSL service from competing ISPs (remember HoosierNet, Kiva, & BlueMarble?), but then the reclassification of DSL from a telecommunications service to an information service killed that. It would be great if you could get Internet service from a marketplace of competing providers and have that service delivered over common carrier infrastructure, but that would require the infrastructure to already be in place and/or laws that require open access to existing private networks. The former requires public investment (read: taxes) which are usually a hard sell and the later creates disincentives for private companies to invest in/upgrade their networks.  Barring any municipal network (Hamilton's statements came after we started looking into this), I felt the best you can do is get more competition. In Bloomington, we have a duopoly between AT&T and Comcast. They are in a very comfortable situation and don't have any reason to upgrade their networks. By bringing Smithville in, they finally have something to sweat about. We did it and if you make it financially viable for them, they will come."
bloomington,330d0m,Jonukas,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"Nice, how did you guys get Smithville to come to your neighborhood? I would love to try and get them to my neighborhood."
bloomington,330d0m,Jonukas,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:41:51 2015 UTC,"We might have been in a better position since we are closer to Ellettsville, but the first thing was to ask them if they'd consider it. You also have to educate your residents about it. In general, it is more expensive than AT&T or Comcast (but not always) and you have to do the work of selling the benefits to your residents. Not everyone is a computer person and might not see a need for fiber. You also have to have a certain percentage of your neighborhood sign up. Otherwise, it's just not cost effective for them to do the work."
bloomington,330d0m,CrispCrew,5,Mon Apr 20 14:02:50 2015 UTC,"How to survive the legal suits that will be raised by Comcast, find the dark fiber, who owns it, how much it would cost to lease/buy, how to pay for pole space/buried lines, how to pay for the last mile, how to configure the network, how to maintain the network, where to set up an ops center, who to provide customer support, etc.  There is a lot that would have to be done, and I would be very surprised if either of the mayoral candidates had any idea that they are selling something they can't deliver. I hate to say it, but Bloomington doesn't have the resources for municipal fiber internet. They would need major outside investments, grants, bonds, and higher taxes.  Chattanooga, a city that has achieved a municipal fiber utility with EPB, had to come up with $330 million to start their project. Total investment estimated at upwards of $500 million. Residential subscribers have to shell out $70 per month for their gig internet. Here, read this: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/25/golden-hammer-chattanooga-chokes-too-much-fiber/?page=all  It isn't going to happen, so please don't base your vote on the well-intentioned, but ultimately uninformed proposition.

One could say that Comcast has a reasonable case in that I doubt their investment in Insight has paid off already. If we cut off a part of their business, it does seem like grounds for a suit. However I've also heard it argued that fiber and copper lines aren't the same, hence the government isn't competing with the private entity. I've heard of towns getting sued by telecos for doing this, I guess I'll have to research how the suits usually turn out. Do you know of any results off the top of your head?"
bloomington,330d0m,derprondo,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:21:10 2015 UTC,"Man, way to be a killjoy with that Chattanooga article (just read it). Though thank you for all the details.  Looking at their numbers, at over 8k per customer expenditure, it is a rather sobering reality.  I'm pretty sure I could have fiber for 5k by paying Smithville to run a private line to the nearest access point. If I'm not mistaken, they charge $1,000 a mile, or at least that's what they quoted me a few years back. The only thing I wonder is, who owns the line then.  I also wonder if maybe starting small would be a good way to not repeat their mistakes and save money. We have the city build access points and the lines that connect them. The access point locations are based on people's willingness to put up the money for the last mile. The service providers are still companies so as to foster competition and provide support.  Something like:  [Comcast/ATT/Verizon/Smithville] --- *** [main hub (under Scotty's?)] --- [access point] *** --- last mile --- [home]  Only the part between the *** is paid by the city.

bloomington,32ujk0,Samuel_I,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:19:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sure we could figure something out. I work at Big Red and UITS so my schedule is flexible, to say the least.

bloomington,32ujk0,Girl_Named_Sandoz,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:50:27 2015 UTC,"That's a good question.  I suppose we should form a group to figure out the where/when/what of our plans and get things moving.  Hiking is pretty easy to plan as it's just figuring out where to hike, when to hike, and how to get there.  Camping is obviously a bit more involved with making sure everyone has the necessary gear and whatnot.  Regardless, what's the best way for you to get a group forum going for planning? Email, facebook, etc?"

It seemed like a good euphemism for another word I chose not to use so that folks wouldn't perceive me as over-dramatic."
bloomington,32v5xw,chudsosoft,13,Fri Apr 17 03:29:16 2015 UTC,"Not that I don't occasionally spout some borderline-insane hippie bullshit from time to time, but come on, man.  Property owners pay for lots of things other people don't -- to compensate for the value a civil society adds to their investment.  That's the social contract at play here.  Most of us, as a group, have decided that we like clean, safe sidewalks after a snow.  We've decided that we like lawns to conform to a certain standard just like the buildings they surround.  Because it looks nice and we want to live in a nice place.  And we've figured a way to do all that without hiring an army.  Believe me, you don't want to pay for the army.  If you don't want to shovel your landlord's sidewalk, negotiate your lease better or move to an apartment."
bloomington,32v5xw,spirit_spine,3,Fri Apr 17 02:22:33 2015 UTC,"Amen, whatever happened to people just taking the initiative to take care of the property around their home? It's such a small cost to the home owner to just clean the snow themselves."
bloomington,32v5xw,spirit_spine,-4,Fri Apr 17 03:08:47 2015 UTC,Exactly! When did the city decide that personal initiative wasn't enough and they had to start fining people for not taking it?
bloomington,32v5xw,CornFedCritic,5,Fri Apr 17 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"You'd only get fined for not taking the initiative to clean the snow. In other words, you'd get fined when personal initiative actually isn't enough."
bloomington,32v5xw,chudsosoft,-2,Fri Apr 17 03:35:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but doesn't fining people for lacking some ""personal initiative"" seem wrong?  It's like, if you don't see things from our perspective, we don't want your kind around here."
bloomington,32v5xw,chudsosoft,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:14:31 2015 UTC,"Well, while I wouldn't generalize things and say """"no,"" in this instance I don't think so.  Does fining someone for lacking ""personal initiative"" to throw away their trash in the trash can when outside seem wrong?    This is such a trivial thing, and it makes our city safer and look nicer.  There's always someone who will disagree with something, no matter WHAT it is.  But you have to look at what benefits society.  This is part of the price to own property.  Just like taxes.  I think it's fair.  I'd rather do it than pay the city $xxx/year to do it for me."
bloomington,32v5xw,chudsosoft,-2,Fri Apr 17 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"The non-sarcastic comment:  Per ""negotiate your lease better or move to an apartment"".  Because these negotiations result in higher rent. Why do we create policies that make rent go up, and then waste money on affordable housing?  Why aren't apartment dwellers who primarily use others' sidewalks forced to pay for clearing them, or forced to sweat clearing them? Why do the old retired folks have to break their backs, or find room in their tight budgets to clear sidewalks for the cradled college youth?  How are these numbers fair on your personal calculator?"
bloomington,32v5xw,rhorama,6,Fri Apr 17 02:54:55 2015 UTC,Life isn't fair and property ownership isn't a prerequisite for participation in society.  The snow is a part of the deal and has been since before you got too old to shovel it.  This is a common ordinance all over the country.  This isn't some crazytown Bloomington thing that you just learned about.
bloomington,32v5xw,chudsosoft,-1,Fri Apr 17 02:58:29 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if it's some crazy B-town thing, I learned about it and I don't like it. I don't care if it's local, county, state, federal, or UN.  Why do you keep attacking me instead of my rhetoric?  I'm not sure I've ever heard ""Life isn't fair"" as a good excuse for policy making.  When the parking-meters were argued as a market viable solution, and now as suggestions of forcing private property owners to clear ice and bird-shit off them on a regular basis come up, can we still argue that it's a market-viable solution? Where does it place the original argument?"
bloomington,32v5xw,chudsosoft,5,Fri Apr 17 03:04:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not making policy, I'm trying to explain to some kid why I shovel my sidewalk.  ninja edit: Not that you should care, but your downvotes didn't come from me.  I don't play that, homie."
bloomington,32v5xw,chudsosoft,0,Fri Apr 17 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"Appreciate it, I only downvote you when I strongly don't agree :)  I shovel my sidewalk too, I'm able bodied. Heck I shovel the public street sometime because the plow leaves nasty corners that neighbors cars get stuck on.  Despite how much personal shoveling I do every winter, I believe fining people for not doing so is unethical. But those are just my 2 cents, and hence I'm on here expressing them."
bloomington,32v5xw,chudsosoft,4,Fri Apr 17 03:12:56 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but you're drawing a pretty arbitrary line.  All participation in society is forced to some degree."
bloomington,32v5xw,life_is_a_highway,-1,Fri Apr 17 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"It is, I agree. Though the use of force is a slippery slope in my book and I'm weary of how far Bloomington is willing to take it.  Personally I think we've taken it far enough with snow, lawn, parking.  When I hear politicians arguing for more use of force, it scares me personally."
bloomington,32v5xw,whiskey_and_wine,2,Fri Apr 17 03:21:17 2015 UTC,use of force   Where does the ordinance mention that?
bloomington,32v5xw,life_is_a_highway,0,Fri Apr 17 05:41:44 2015 UTC,"I was just parroting the previous commenters post per ""participation in society is forced"". Though when a fine is imposed, and the police force is utilized to impose it, is that not use of force? Maybe I'm unclear on the definition?"
bloomington,32v5xw,cellogenius,4,Fri Apr 17 05:47:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know how better to explain it than neighbors working together to have a better neighborhood.  That's all it is.  If you value other things more, coolio, man.  Do you.  But I'm thinking maybe you don't own any houses."
bloomington,32v5xw,An_Honest_Ferengi,2,Fri Apr 17 03:00:12 2015 UTC,"I do, and I shovel my sidewalk (+ some). My neighborhood is, however, being overrun by students (not complaining, keeps the real estate up), so I like to entertain others' perspectives."
bloomington,32v5xw,Elaine_Benes_,-4,Fri Apr 17 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"Not that I don't occasionally begin my comments by insulting people, but come on, man. Most of us have simply decided that clear sidewalks and nice laws are well worth the individual liberty those borderline-insane hippies have to sacrifice. How can you say you live in a ""civil society"" without a regulation yard (even if full of poison) and a sidewalk full of sweat. Get over it, I take it, is your point?"
bloomington,32v5xw,Elaine_Benes_,7,Fri Apr 17 02:35:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm telling you that us grown-ups often do things we don't want to do because that's what grown-up life is all about.  I don't like shoveling snow either, but I'm a douche if I don't do it because I don't own the entire street.  Just the one part that I agree to keep from looking like shantytown to the benefit of the people around me.  I'm not an island in a sea of liberty.  I have neighbors and I like them."
bloomington,32v5xw,CornFedCritic,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:53:05 2015 UTC,"I agree on not being a douche, but you don't own your sidewalk either. Forcing individuals to clear public property seems like the douche thing to do in my book. Otherwise these policies should come with giving back those easements of land. Will you agree on that? We give back the land, then force them to clear it?"
bloomington,32v5xw,hamfriend,2,Fri Apr 17 02:57:11 2015 UTC,"I misunderstood your premise there.  I don't have an educated opinion on easements.  I don't have anything for you on that one.  Maybe it's a good idea, maybe it isn't."
bloomington,32v5xw,life_is_a_highway,-2,Fri Apr 17 03:10:44 2015 UTC,"No.  ""Them"" is just another word for ""us.""  It's still us clearing the sidewalk, just via another mechanism.  I think the real value judgement here is about the how clean we like our sidewalks."
bloomington,32v5xw,Imperial_Ruby,0,Fri Apr 17 03:02:37 2015 UTC,"Nah, the real value judgement is:  clean sidewalk > forced labor ?  or  clean sidewalk > $x tax money ?  If not, then:  clean sidewalks < human cost"
bloomington,32v5xw,Imperial_Ruby,5,Fri Apr 17 03:07:58 2015 UTC,I think having property owners remove the snow from their sidewalks mitigates a substantial amount of money the city would pay for snow removal if it wasn't the property owners' responsibility. That money would ultimately come from property owners as well.
bloomington,32v5xw,Elaine_Benes_,2,Fri Apr 17 00:09:55 2015 UTC,"Good point, I wonder how much higher the property taxes would be if the city hired some service to shovel all the sidewalks. No idea."
bloomington,32v5xw,rhorama,2,Tue Apr 21 23:34:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Others seem to be claiming that the real solution to this issue would be to not require snow removal at all, but I think that presents a safety risk as well as loss of productivity after all. I think snow removal is one of those inconveniences you have to live with if you live among other people."
bloomington,32v5xw,whiskey_and_wine,-8,Wed Apr 22 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"If having clear sidewalks is such a substantial amount of money, maybe we shouldn't try to make it happen? This also seems to overburden certain property owners (ones with sidewalks) while those without share no burden while freely using the sidewalks. Taxing everyone to pay for it almost seems far fairer."
bloomington,32v5xw,spirit_spine,7,Fri Apr 17 00:20:05 2015 UTC,This is how it's been done in the North for years. No one complains. We just wake up in the morning and do it. Are you suggesting that people shouldn't have to mow their lawns anymore either?
bloomington,32v5xw,CornFedCritic,8,Fri Apr 17 02:47:09 2015 UTC,TIL that there are people that live in areas where this isn't the norm. I'm from the good ol' 574. We had to shovel the sidewalks all the time. It's just a part of living in a city.
bloomington,32v5xw,CornFedCritic,5,Fri Apr 17 03:38:45 2015 UTC,"Moved here from Minneapolis so yeah, protesting this seems a little ridiculous...If you have a bad back, you pay a kid from the neighborhood to shovel, done. It's much less of a nuisance than lawn care even because it doesn't snow that often here..."
bloomington,32okca,DrInsano,8,Wed Apr 15 13:26:40 2015 UTC,"This seems like a good choice. I looked through all the open land the University owned and this was the only one that made sense to my either. There have been rumblings that the golf course hasn't been solvent, so I won't be surprised if this expands over the next decade or two.   One immediate question pops to mind. There's usually a bunch of other businesses that open near a hospital: medical supply shops, restaurants, pharmacies, etc. I bet CVS is thrilled! But where will all that other development end up landing? There's no other space to the west on the bypass, and the area south around College Mall is pretty developed out. My guess is that we'll start to see that area transform over the next 10-20 years toward coattail industry that support the hospital."

Pretty interesting, because I had heard that they were thinking of moving the Bloomington Hospital over to that big open area towards Ellettsville, around where 37 and 46 meet. I guess they obviously decided against that move, but now I'm wondering what, if anything, will ever go in that area?"
bloomington,32okca,devilboy222,3,Wed Apr 15 13:29:09 2015 UTC,"That is one thing I wonder, since I believe they own that property near Ellettsville already.  Maybe they will just sell it now.  I watched the announcement live and didn't hear anything about it."
bloomington,32okca,Destroyer23,2,Wed Apr 15 13:39:53 2015 UTC,"If they do own the land there already then I hope they don't take too long in selling it off. Then again, they might just be waiting for the right buyer for it, as that's going to be some prime real estate here real soon what with 69 going by that area. I can see Meijer's buying some land up and opening a store there, as well as some of the bigger trucker gas stations (Mr. Fuel, Flying J, etc...)."
bloomington,32okca,Destroyer23,2,Wed Apr 15 13:45:22 2015 UTC,My guess is more housing divisions will start popping up in that area now.
bloomington,32okca,ZogoRanger,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:42:45 2015 UTC,"You think? With as close as it is to where 69 will be, I would imagine it's more likely to turn into a commercial district, especially since right now none of the other exit points for 69 are very conducive for new gas stations or other large stores."
bloomington,32okca,chrobb,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:47:47 2015 UTC,That's a good point too.. hadn't thought of the I-69 angle.

bloomington,32okca,eobanb,2,Wed Apr 15 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"So just to be clear to everyone, does this means they are demolishing the current hospital?"
bloomington,32okca,limeybastard,3,Wed Apr 15 23:30:19 2015 UTC,They haven't said what they're doing with the old location yet. I have plans for it.

bloomington,32okca,Girl_Named_Sandoz,3,Thu Apr 16 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great outcome. It's a location already well-served by infrastructure, it solidifies ties between the IU School of Medicine and IU Health, and being next to the CIB makes additional biotech and bioinformatics research partnerships more likely in the future."
bloomington,32okca,swatagnat,3,Wed Apr 15 13:35:45 2015 UTC,"I think the main drawback that has been raised is the old central location was near several bus routes and relatively quick to get to for poorer people.  The new one, although I imagine they may adjust routes to meet the demand, is currently not on any routes; only the 9 and the 6 go anywhere near there (roughly half a mile from the driving range?), and those routes do not connect to the downtown terminal, making it very difficult for a south or west side rider to reach them, and they are often filled to capacity with students at peak times.  To properly serve people in Bloomington who cannot afford cars or are incapable of driving due to illness and injury,.the city will have to create (from scratch or through modifying the 3, 6, or 9) a bus route that goes from the downtown terminal to the new medical complex."
bloomington,32okca,nustoodent,2,Wed Apr 15 22:20:37 2015 UTC,Certainly much easier to add service to a new part of campus than running a bus halfway to Ellettsville

With dense game traffic, accessibility to the new hospital's emergency department might not be convenient.  Ambulances and other official vehicles can get through congested traffic more easily, but what about an individual driving themselves or a companion to the hospital?  A partner driving a mother in labor?"

They also got caught ordering high dollar Wagner rotors along with cheap rotors. They put the cheap rotors in the Wagner boxes and sent them back, charging the customer for the better and higher priced Wagner rotors while also fucking over the parts stores."

bloomington,32n7c0,ulsanforyou,3,Thu Apr 16 02:26:51 2015 UTC,"If you want tires, maybe. You can get better deals at Tieman's over on Yost Avenue.  If you want real work done on a vehicle visit a repair shop, not a muffler or tire shop."
bloomington,32n7c0,youdontknowdick,2,Thu Apr 16 02:37:20 2015 UTC,"I don't need new tires. I just heard that Tire and Wheel does good work on things like axles, etc.  I'll look into Tieman's.  And since we're sort of on the topic of repair places, do you know of a decent body shop that offers free quotes?   Edit: dog kicked my arm."
bloomington,32n7c0,ulsanforyou,2,Thu Apr 16 12:48:25 2015 UTC,"Tieman's most likely do axles, pretty sure they just do tires.  Try Minton's or Landmark body shops."

They charged her $120 to install them. $30 a tire seemed way too much and they also scratched up our rims. So I'll definitely go elsewhere next time.

There are a couple of guys around town who do good work on the side and you won't find them otherwise. Also, the older guys/gals will have a little more knowledge about the shops they sell to. Most shops and parts stores use electronic ordering over the internet so there is no relationship built up like there used to be from phone calls. When I was selling parts, the last thing I wanted was a customer to come back and rip my ass over a bad referral so I only recommended shops I knew and trusted for specific work."

I took some pictures too I found they also have a website: http://lapoblana.us  as well as facebook  Damn good chorizo and carne asada tacos.  Definitely overpriced.  A burrito was $9!  The tacos were about $3 each and I would need 3-4 to get full.  Not cheap, but definitely delicious.  Oh, and you have to ask for hot sauce.  They have red and green.

Whatever, here are a few:  -For a really good gyro, go to the International Market on 4th.   -The best place for free downtown parking is the parking lot off of Rogers. It's meant for the B Line crowd. Park there and it's just a short walk to downtown.   -During huge events in Bloomington when all the grocery stores are packed, the south side Kroger is usually pretty quiet still.  -There is a giant crane that lives on the river on the Rail Trail, about two miles south of County Club Dr. There is a group dedicated to keeping the area clean for the big guy.  -The small, family owned pet shop near Dairy Queen on S. Walnut is awesome. Also, there are many cats (if you're into that sort of thing).  -A lot of the Krogers (College Mall, south end) have booze people that are basically there to answer questions about beer, wine and liquor.

bloomington,32341h,ziphoward,12,Fri Apr 10 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"Delilah's doesn't sell any dogs that come from mills. The owner actively makes sure that none of their dogs come from mills. The only dogs they sell are from individual owners that have litters. That is why their puppy kennels are rarely full. They only sell them when they have people contact them saying they have a litter. Also the fire was in no way the responsibility of Delilah's, it was the responsibility of the landlord. I was there the day after the fire to offer to help and foster animals that survived. The owner was an emotional wreck. It almost killed her. She loves animals, with a passion. Don't spread rumors without basis."

Here's another perspective, unfortunately yes they sell small mixed breeds of dogs but I doubt very much they use ""Mills"" and the small family breeders that they use may be over breeding because I do not know but that info can be looked up through ASPCA but ALL purebreds/or fashionable mixes are over bred. It doesn't matter if they had a loving and caring home with all the squeaky toys. They are not healthy in general. I have known the owner and have been a customer for years and one time I adopted a cat she had rescued (he was awesome and lived a long time) I have never experienced better more thoughtful service and honest responses to my food/care questions. I even got a call letting me know that one of the companies I was using just changed their formula to cheapen the product and that to me was above and beyond.

bloomington,32341h,BtownIU,11,Sun Apr 12 04:31:51 2015 UTC,"Travel / Transportation:    During peak times, avoid going east / west on any street between 2nd and 17th. Instead go south to Hillside, or north to 17th or the bypass. When traveling east on Atwater in the afternoon, it's advantageous to go straight up to High St. and turn left, then get back on 3rd going east. While the lights don't always work out, it is often faster especially when someone is trying to turn left onto Union from 3rd.  There are two ways to get to Nashville. One is going straight there from 3rd street, the other is from 10th. 3rd street turns into 46 and 10th turns into 45. Without any traffic, 46 may be a little faster, however with traffic 45 is often empty. It is also very scenic, and it drops you off on 135 and Nashville is just a few miles south.  If you're coming south on the bypass aiming to get to the east side by college mall, the optimal route is as follows: if the light at 10th is totally red, take the left turn arrow and then south on Pete Ellis. If the arrow is ending or the light is green, proceed through 10th and look down to 3rd. If 3rd is completely red, it's a toss up, but if it's green you probably won't make it so take a left at the street by the church and go that way.  Get around college mall using the perimeter roads, not 3rd or College Mall Road. There are ways to get to Kroger, Chipotle, Target, etc. that don't require either of the high traffic routes. Going east to west past 37 is often fastest if you go up to the bypass and then go south on 37, especially during peak times.    Activities:   Most people make it down to Lake Monroe at some point; make sure to check out the big dam on the south end and the park that's slightly east of there. You can take very scenic drives heading east from the park, but plan your route beforehand.  The quarry! Watch Breaking Away if you haven't already and then go jump off the cock rock at the quarry. It's south on Fairfax. There's a neighborhood you can park in but there's been some development going on so I'm not sure where to recommend parking currently. Be respectful, and be fucking careful jumping off the rooftop.  There's badass camping and hiking south of 446 just past Lake Monroe. There's a firetower down there that a lot of people seem to enjoy. If you want a better firetower, and aren't afraid of old decaying structures, there's another one off 46 at the abandoned ski hill. It's up to you to find it and climb it!  If you're a motorcyclist then boy do I have routes for you. My favorite is a big loop: 45E -> 135S -> 46W. Very scenic. Another great one is Fairfax down to the dam at lake monroe than east back to 46. If you have a dual sport and don't mind risking a little trespassing, go to the abandoned ski place. Some company came in last year and actually groomed it specifically for dirtbikes -- I only found evidence of it after the fact but it was pretty sweet.  Brown County has awesome hiking and camping -- most if it free. You can even find a ton geodes if you know where to look! If you're having a fire at your house, keep a pack of hotdogs out. Only cooking fires are technically permitted in the city limits.    Beer (Probably the most important information)   There are a ton of breweries in and around Bloomington. I'm gonna go ahead and list my favorites that are within about 30-45 minutes of Bloomington. I suppose I'll include Indy because why not.  Taxman Brewing (Bargersville, IN) -- this place rocks. It's a small drive from Bloomington, but it's so freakin' good. Their brews tend to be less bitter than most micro's (my gf actually likes their double IPA), but they definitely have something for everyone. It seems like they lean toward Euro / Belgian brews including dubels, tripels, and even quads. Declaration and Exemption are my favs. Their food menu is small but supremely high quality. The chef is great. I had this southwestern burger with chorizo that was fucking awesome. As you can tell, I fucking love Taxman.  Bloomington Brewing Company (Bloomington @ Lennies) -- so this place is hidden on 10th street, right across from the central dorms (Ashton, Teter). The bacon turkey melt is probably one of the best sandwhiches in Bloomington. The beer is awesome, I like the Rooftop IPA but it's all good. The people are super nice, it's always fun to saddle up to the bar and shoot the shit when I'm taking a lunch break on campus.  Planetary Brewing (Greenwood, IN) -- this place is cool as fuck. Pretty small, pretty new, but the dudes making it have been around and know their shit. Specifically, their Apeshit, which happens to be the best banana infused anything I have ever had the privilege to consume. Big Woods / Quaff On (Bloomington, Nashville) -- this place is great. They had a really awesome coffee stout a couple months ago that was awesome. The menu at Quaff On was pretty small not that impressive, but the last time I went for food was after they had just opened so perhaps that's expanded since. They've got a tap room, pizza place, and a new bar expansion in Nashville. There's occasionally live music at the pizza place, if you're into like two dudes singing Blind Melon covers and shit.  Upland (Bloomington, IN) -- you probably know Upland. Their a local powerhouse, and the new renovations mean you can usually get a table these days. Their wheat is the best wheat I've had in the area, and the other brews are of course high quality as well. The pulled pork is badass, as is the spinach artichoke dip. Salt Creek (Bloomington, Bedford) -- this place just opened a location downtown on 4th street I believe. It's got a nice, small atmosphere (I only went upstairs) and the menu was good. The spinach artichoke dip was spicy and unique and totally delicious. The beer is, honestly, fairly generic. It's definitely good, but not quite unique. The location in Bedford is really cool, definitely out of the beaten path. I really enjoy riding south on Old SR 37 as it takes you straight there and is pretty scenic.  Function Brewing (Bloomington) -- I've only been here once, and it was at like 11:30AM so I got the coffee stout and it was delicious. Very clean, hip atmosphere.  MashCraft, Indianapolis Brewing Company, Fountain Square, Sun King, Flat 12 (Indianapolis, Greenwood) -- These are all awesome. Huge shoutout to Indianapolis Brewing Company, I was very impressed. I went to Flat 12 on their yearly tasting day and it was good. I'm not a huge fan of bourbon beers but if you are this place is going to be your mecca.    Well this ended up being a lot longer than I expected.. but there you go. If you have any questions, feel free to ask."

bloomington,32341h,LiveMas2016,7,Mon Apr 13 14:10:29 2015 UTC,"One of my best tips is to watch Craigslist and the IU/Onestart classifieds as each semester winds down. Keep an eye out for graduating students attempting to get rid of their electronics, vehicles, and other knick-knacks. A friend of mine got a BMW convertible with only about 75k miles on it for less than 5k when the KBB value was well over 10. He's been driving it for years. Kilroy's on Kirkwood also offers free food on Fridays. I have never been, but my parents took advantage so many times that they got sick of it and no longer go. YMMV since I don't have firsthand experience. The parking garage on 4th and Walnut has been my best friend for years. First three hours free, which basically means you can park downtown starting at 2pm. The Bloomington ultimate frisbee community is freaking amazing. Call it a shameless plug, but consider this a social hack if you're looking to meet new people and get exercise. Such a warm and welcoming community. Plus, we drink a lot! Interested in archaeology/anthropology? The local creekbeds are super fun to walk (in, not near), and I have personally found some really fantastic artifacts and fossils. Ex.: a beautiful 4-inch black obsidian arrow/spearhead and two well-preserved crinoid fossils about five inches tall by three in diameter.  Scenic View on 446 is a treat rarely enjoyed by those who don't already know it's there. You get a great view of the lake and they serve awesome food. I highly recommend the pineapple burger. Patton Cave is accessible by foot and by canoe, and it's a great introductory cave system. Pretty short, and if conditions are right, you can emerge out the exit closer to the entry than you realized you were. Another cave tip: Buckner Cave is fucking awesome. You need permission to enter (easily attained, but generally keeps the riffraff out), and it's incredibly deep and not far out of town. I went in January some years ago when there was over a foot of snow on the ground and came out totally soaked from some underground falls inside. Wouldn't trade that experience for anything."

One negative about SM though is that their turnover rate sucks and you can find some OLD beer in there that is going to be BAD.

Food:   Rush Hour Station is a great place to get a greasy burger that not many people seem to know about (they have Asian inspired burgers as well). Plus the owner is a hilarious and kind lady.  Somewhere on this subreddit, there is a google doc that has a list of discounts and deals for Bloomington restaurants.  Don't buy the olives from Sahara Mart.....just trust me one this one.    Exploration:   Not technically a secret, but there is a tunnel on campus from Jordan Hall to near the Chemistry building. There's a cool abandoned water treatment facility near Griffy dog park if you're into exploration.  You can (or at least used to) get up in the clock tower on the north side of campus with a little maneuvering. If you're feeling intrepid, there are storm water tunnels that go from Jordan River on Indiana Ave. down to Rally's on S. Walnut (DON'T GO UNLESS THE WATER LEVELS ARE LOW) There are steam tunnels under campus that can be accessed near Kirkwood Hall (VERY DANGEROUS: HOT STEAM, CRAMPED QUARTERS)  The Zoom Flume is an abandoned water slide from the 70s that is to the right just after you cross Lake Monroe on 446.   Misc:   The park on 9th St. near the B-Line is great for sledding without having to walk up a huge hill Deam Wilderness just south of Lake Monroe is a great place to camp   I'm sure I have a lot more but I'll just post these for now. A good general rule is to keep your eyes and ears open. Also being kind to everyone and taking the time to talk to people can open many doors. That's just a decent life rule as well.

If there is no car coming I will keep going. If you have a shitty bike, it's really a pain in the ass to come to a complete stop at every single stop sign because it takes a lot of time and effort to get up to speed again. Whereas all that drivers have to do is slightly push down their foot to speed up, cyclists have a to put in a lot more physical effort. So I do bend the laws a bit.

Those who waited patiently in line on a Saturday morning understood why it never needed one.  But this week, a solemn sign was taped to the humble Bloomington diner's glass front door at 1724 S. Walnut St., where business at Wee Willie's has come to a hush.  ""Our main man Roy died,"" it reads. ""Closed until next week.""  Since then, the parking lot surrounding Wee Willie's has been empty. The tables inside are clean and neatly set, but absolutely vacant.  Roy Wathen, the longtime manager of Wee Willie's, passed away in the early morning hours of Easter Sunday. He spent most of his 36 years as a server, short-order cook and all-around wisecracker.  ""He was on the grill every day,"" co-owner and sister Brenda Lutgens said Wednesday afternoon. ""Some of our long-time customers would come in the back door, and he would be so quick and funny with them. I don't know anybody who could think and react as fast as he did.""  But without Roy's quickness, his wit — and his ability to not only serve breakfast, but provide staff direction with a smile — Lutgens said Wee Willie's, a former A&W restaurant her family has operated in that location since 1967, might not re-open.  ""Everything is so up in the air that I honestly don't know what we're going to do,"" Brenda Lutgens said. ""(Roy) was just indispensable.""  Brenda's husband and Wee Willie's other co-owner, William ""Bill"" Lutgens, is now 76. Their son, Troy Lutgens, manages a second Wee Willie's location that opened in Ellettsville in 2003. Troy Lutgens said the Ellettsville restaurant will be closed Saturday for the funeral, but otherwise should continue operation.  Brenda said she and her husband have been spending the week at home, preparing for the funeral. They're trying to focus on the tasks at hand, but know they'll have to decide on the Bloomington restaurant's next step quite soon.  ""When we lost Roy, we lost a tremendous man,"" she said. ""Nobody's going to fill his shoes."""

They are very left-biased in their coverage, but that doesn't bother me, b/c I know to expect it. Just like if I go to CNN I expect the same, and if I go to Fox, I expect a heavy bias to the right.

It was a pretty awful experience. I've heard of people having issues with bedbugs that didn't get taken care of for weeks! I don't recommend them at all. If you're looking for quiet townhouses, check out orchard glen on the west side. As much as I endorse them, people are going to think I work for the company. I swear I don't. I just really wish someone had told me about them sooner. I lived there about four years before buying a house here in town and loved every second of it. Even after moving into my own house, I would drive by orchard glen because I missed living there. It's very quiet, trees and parks everywhere, maintenance is on top of it, the townhouses are large with ample storage, washer/dryer hookups in all units, parking is never an issue, they pay for the heat, rent is ridiculously cheap, and you don't sign a lease. Try them out. You can always move out of you don't like living there, just give them a 30 day notice."

If your problems included loud motorcycles, bottles being thrown, fights being started, and just general nonsense, it may very well have been us. I don't know when you lived there, but if you did, and if you had to put up with me or any of my friends drunken tomfoolery, I really do apologize.   That being said, fuck those places. When I lived there, I got mugged on the beeline trail behind it by crazed homeless men with meth eyes. Not to mention my shower foundation rotted out, exposing leakage and the wooden boards to the apartment beneath, and they did not fix it for months. When I tried to move out, they screwed me in every single possible way even when staying strict to the contract. These people are skeezy bastards and you should never deal with them.   Well, the mainenance guys were pretty cool whenever they made it around, and some people in the office were nice too, but in general that whole company is some serious fuckery and so are the apartments they swindle you into."

bloomington,31rm5g,freewoodfloor,10,Tue Apr 7 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"You’ve given me something to think about. I thought Neher might have been a good candidate, but on closer examination I’m not so sure. He doesn’t really provide anything concrete on his platform, and in the debates he does use a lot of political jargon, without providing anything specific. I really like Hamilton’s internet proposal, as well as his plans to keep housing in Bloomington affordable and get solar panels on city buildings - overall a good platform. I can't take Linnemeir seriously, and he doesn't seem very mayoral."
bloomington,31rm5g,fortunese,4,Tue Apr 7 20:17:02 2015 UTC,"I can't take solar panels in Indiana seriously. If someone wants to do it privately, fine, but I would never vote for such a use of public funds. This seems like a feelgood thing that doesn't add up in my mind.  So we put up solar panels in a location they will be highly underutilized because we have the money. With a surplus of coal, Indiana sells it. 25% of US coal is shipped to Asia, burning a bunch more fossil fuels in the shipping process. The coal is then burnt in, less efficient, more polluting, furnaces to create the power necessary to build the solar panels.  Am I the only one that doesn't like this kind of ""green"" stuff?"
bloomington,31rm5g,sentry360,2,Tue Apr 7 21:13:06 2015 UTC,"Though that's not to say people shouldn't go solar. I think privately however. Maybe in the desert and Cali with public funds makes sense. Personally I've been doing the research, and by buying dirt cheap factory reject cells on ebay. Wiring them up myself into the ceiling of a planned sunroom I want to build (so as to not have to build panels which nearly double the cost). With a lot of luck I might be able to break even in about 12 years. This is with 0 panel and labor cost. Just cells, wires, and hardware."
bloomington,31rm5g,sentry360,3,Tue Apr 7 21:21:36 2015 UTC,I know people in Bloomington who have got theirs paid back within a few years with the support from some federal programs.   Solar thermal (for water heating) is also a lot more efficient than PV for electricity.

bloomington,31rm5g,Iwilllive,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:35:12 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with solar thermal, but I'm not sure I agree solar panels being economically viable everywhere.  It makes a little more sense for Germany. Their energy prices are nearly double of ours, and provide Russia with a serious political lever into Europe. We are watching this leverage play out in Eastern Europe and Georgia right now where Russia is taking territory and the west is shaking in their purse strings to do any serious sanctions.  Germany's recent pull away from nuclear has also only exacerbated their dependence on Russian gas. I could understand overspending on green energy in such a situation."
bloomington,31rm5g,sentry360,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"Funny story, I just finished writing a piece about exactly this issue.  Only I completely disagree with you.    Solar panels on the roof of municipal buildings doesn't go far enough.  We need to be spending public money to build a whole distributed municipally owned utility that operates completely on renewables.  We can't afford to keep burning coal and we can't afford to wait for national action on Climate Change.  As of 2017, we've used up all of our carbon budget and every new emissions source is pushing us further in to the catastrophic -- IE civilization ending -- consequences range.  This is coming from places like the International Energy Agency, the World Bank and Nasa's Goddard Space Center.    Here's what I just posted, so I don't have to rewrite the whole argument: http://theroadgoeson.com/articles/article/the-true-meaning-of-pragmatism-bloomingtons-mayoral-question"
bloomington,31rm5g,dbingham,2,Wed Apr 8 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"I think you missed the point of my statement. I'm saying spending tax money on solar panels in Bloomington does nothing for the CO2 emissions. In fact we create more by not using the coal and exporting it.  We'd be better off finding a partner city in the southwest that uses coal for electricity but pays double. Invest in their solar infrastructure, which would have an ROI two to three times as fast. This decreases demand on coal, which keeps our electricity dirt cheap like it is.  I'm not sure I agree that the city level vs private, state, federal is the place to address a civilization ending threat.  Municipal broadband is another story and I agree 100% on that. However I'm not sure where you got the ""They’re currently making a 97% profit charging us for mediocre broadband, and they’re perfectly comfortable with that."" 97% doesn't seem realistic, but I could be wrong. Do you have a source?"
bloomington,31rm5g,sentry360,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"I agree it seems way too absurd to be realistic.  But, unfortunately, it is: http://www.technologyreview.com/news/510176/when-will-the-rest-of-us-get-google-fiber/   In parts of the country, slower-speed copper, fast-download cable, and a few fiber networks are already built out. The cable distribution giants like Time Warner Cable and Comcast are already making a 97 percent margin on their “almost comically profitable” Internet services, according to Craig Moffet, an analyst at the Wall Street firm Bernstein Research. As Levin points out, “If you are making that kind of margin, it’s hard to improve it.” And most Americans have no choice but to deal with their local cable company.   Actually, here's what that number original came from and it referred to TWC initially.    http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/time-warner-cables-97-pro_b_6591916.html  But I think it's a reasonable assumption to make that Comcast and AT&T would have similar margins."
bloomington,31rm5g,dbingham,2,Wed Apr 8 21:16:24 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that we're all getting hosed, but I still personally have a hard time believing it's to the tune of 97%. It's just with profits that high, wouldn't it drive more competition? What about the costs of putting in the initial cables. And if that's why they get to draw that 97% profit, than another company should put their money where their mouth is and lay down the cables themselves.  Smithville's fiber work was rather expensive. Verizon has been doing a lot of fiber work, at the detriment to their short-term stock gains with some unhappy shareholders. Though they decided to invest in the long term.  I see no reason Google wouldn't get into the game. I know they say it's not their thing, but with profits that high, why isn't it. They keep killing services because they're unprofitable, yet won't do this? Do their shareholders really not want high revenues?  I was also all for bloom4fiber.net a few years back. https://bloomington.in.gov/googlegigabit Submitted nominations, got everyone I know to nominate.  But it really does seem like Google was just trying to stir the pot without anything substantial behind it.  Thus I would like it if Hamilton had ran some numbers on the cost before making any promises. Could have used a tiny part of that fat campaign fund."
bloomington,31rm5g,sentry360,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:24:54 2015 UTC,"But it really does seem like Google was just trying to stir the pot without anything substantial behind it.   I take that back, they still have the program going. Though they seem to be expanding at a rather slow rate. Which also makes me think profits can't be that high. https://fiber.google.com/about/  Though I'm not certain I agree with their price scale either, as the average user will be subsidizing both the upper and lower end users, which I guess is somewhat better than what already exists where both the low/average users subsidize the top users."
bloomington,31rm5g,sentry360,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:35:16 2015 UTC,"Also, I'd be interested in seeing your numbers on solar panels as well.  It doesn't add up to me, given that solar panels can generate power for decades, that the panels would generate more CO2 in manufacturing than they would save over their lifetimes.  I've heard this assertion before, but it was always coming from climate deniers and fossil fuel apologists and never backed up by real data.  I'll admit I've never dug that deep in to it.  Edit: On further research, looks like it was true until about 5 years ago: http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-04/solar-panels-now-make-more-electricity-they-use  Edit again: Oh hey, the turning point may have come even earlier.  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-cells-prove-cleaner-way-to-produce-power/"
bloomington,31rm5g,dbingham,2,Wed Apr 8 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"I have no issue with solar panels, and by no means was I making the assertion that they generate more CO2 than they conserve.  The point I'm trying to make is that using them here in Indiana results in exporting more coal. Coal burnt here vs burnt elsewhere produces less CO2 because of less shipping. A bit like buying local produce.  The panels should probably be installed places that get far more sunlight yet rely on expensive imported coal. It just doesn't make a lot of sense to me for us to buy solar panels hence driving up their cost, while others in sunnier areas burn our imported coal because they still think solar panels are cost prohibitive."
bloomington,31rm5g,sentry360,2,Thu Apr 9 01:04:24 2015 UTC,"I don't have them off the top of my head, it's been a little while as I put the project on the back burner for it being cost prohibitive. I can re-run them soon as I am hoping the technology is getting cheap enough and electricity expensive enough to give it another go.  The part that drove the costs beyond practicality for me last time had to do with storage. Using batteries is neither green nor practical if you're on a grid. Indiana is actually a pretty good net metering state. Your utility has to pay you same price for electricity that you buy it. However the grid tie inverter and a certified electrician to install it made it cost prohibitive last time.  It may be a few weeks and/or months before I come back with real #s, I'm not ready for the project yet and I don't want to source materials and labor for sake of a reddit argument. I will however do it for sake of wanting to actually do it."
bloomington,31rm5g,sentry360,6,Thu Apr 9 01:58:02 2015 UTC,If I were forced to predict the winner of this election based on website design alone it would be John Hamilton. Also his name sounds like a god damn president.
bloomington,31rm5g,handsopen,3,Thu Apr 9 00:37:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. I voted for John Hamilton the last time he ran for mayor and I hope he has better luck this time. This is a good post and I'll certainly direct people here for more information!

bloomington,31rm5g,DREWHOUSER,5,Wed Apr 8 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"Man.. I'm really torn on this.  I originally was leaning towards Neher, who I'm much more familiar with. He seems like a nice guy, and has always seemed to have a good viewpoint on issues that come up during city council meetings. That being said, Hamilton's platform seems WAY more specific than Neher's. I don't 100% understand all of his goals. Here's a quote from his platform, which there are quotes like this on Neher's website:  ""I-69 is coming soon. We need a comprehensive strategy to mitigate its negative impacts and maintain our community character.""  Of course we need a strategy! As a voter I'd like to know what that strategy is!  As for John, I love that he has specific goals that I also agree with, but my main concern is that for the past couple of years I've been to a ton of city meetings, and somehow I had not heard of him before the election started. There are a lot of familiar faces around city government and his hasn't been one of them, at least for the past couple of years. So I guess part of me wonders where he has been and if he actually cares about the city.    I really don't know! I'm still torn!"
bloomington,31rm5g,dbingham,2,Wed Apr 8 01:18:00 2015 UTC,"Drew, I think John got burned last time around by some of the local Democratic party stalwarts.  He challenged Kruzan four years ago in 2011, and they all lined up behind Kruzan.  Some of them spread some nasty rumors about him that didn't actually hold up when you examined them, but were enough to sink his campaign.  I know he made a couple of overtures to the city to get involved again (he chaired the sustainability commission from 2005 - 2009), but was largely ignored.  I can't really blame him for deciding to unplug from the government for a while.  But that doesn't mean he hasn't been involved in local issues.  He's been president of the Shalom center board for the last two years.  I asked a friend of mine who serves with him on the board what he though of John early in the campaign, and in response I got a ringing endorsement.   I've found him to be a very active and engaged (as well as efficient and effective) board president.  He has demonstrated real knowledge and concern about the ""local issues"" of homelessness, poverty and affordable housing here in Bloomington.     He finished by saying that John had ""his hands in the dirt at Shalom""."

I doubt they've already had a return on their investment. And if we compensate them, should we then AT&T to make it fair?  In which case, why don't we just use eminent domain, take their cables, and give them whatever we feel is fair.  Figured I'll play a little devil's advocate :)."
bloomington,31rm5g,slacksonslacks,2,Thu Apr 9 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"Before this post, I was heavily leaning towards Hamilton, only because of his stance on High Speed Internet.  Because of this post making my research a bit easier, I have to say, I am leaning more towards Linnemeier.  Yeah, he is a bit odd, and not necessarily ""mayoral"", but he is pretty much who I would describe if I were to describe a typical Bloomington Resident.  I like his stance on each issue he has posted on his site.  I can't see a fault in his logic, or reseasoning.  Though I will say, I also like Hamilton as well.  I would be happy with either, but I do like Linnemeier just a bit more.  I admire his wanting to be a ""grass roots"" mayor."

However, sometimes he claims that both candidates are the same and that he provides a real alternative, but hasn't been able to distinguish himself much on the issues, in my view. Also, I don't agree with his assertion that the other two candidates are the same, and I think I covered that already. I'm sympathetic to his position though, because the other two candidates are getting the financial support and endorsements that he hasn't gotten, so it has been an uphill battle for him."

That would be a huge factor in determining where you want to look for a place.    I usually check craigslist for housing options whenever I'm trying to find a new place... although you wouldn't be able to check the place out before moving in, you still might be able to find a month-to-month place, or short-term living place.    Alternatively, I think they have hotels that cater to people staying for extended periiods.  You might consider checking in to one of those and keeping your stuff in storage while you look for an apartment that you actually like.

The pictures on their website are exactly how the apartments look (I currently live here) and the landlord is one of the nicest people I've ever met. Maintenance is prompt (same day usually within hours) and friendly. I can't say enough good things about living here and if I wasn't moving in with a roomie I would be living here for the foreseeable future    Or check out Nextwave - I just signed a lease with them and they seem very competent and have options in various price ranges. I've personally looked at the Batchelor Heights apartments (3 Bed townhomes, huge kitchen and living room, garage and a deck, community pool for $990 a month) and they're really well maintained and pretty apartments so I'm sure the other communities would be up to par.

Make sure you look for heat treated and avoid chemically treated pallets.  Pallet Markings   HT = heat treated MB = Methyl Bromide (phased out in 2010) DB  = debarked   Some pallets will be marked with HT, but are also pressure treated.  Avoid these by learning what pressure treated versus untreated wood looks like.  Other sources of contamination include whatever the pallets were exposed to while they were being used.  </PSA>"

His theory is that a lot of these guys want to work for themselves (or a very flexible boss) so they can do just enough work to get food, shelter, and beer/drugs; after that's taken care of, they just fade away until they need work again.

bloomington,319uia,Zac_Nicholson,4,Fri Apr 3 03:44:40 2015 UTC,"Eh.  A lot of this narrative is pretty stilted.  Prior to WWII there was a deep housing crisis, and what precipitated flight from the crowded urban centers was the availability of cheap financing of land purchase through the GI Bill.  ""White Flight"" was one of the driving phenomena for the larger urban centers- black families were unable to take advantage of the FDIC financing, so the only land they could purchase was in the cities that white people were fleeing.  What drove flight from smaller towns was primarily economic.  Small towns typically had one or two large manufacturing firms.  Those firms went out of business through the 1970's as much of the American model of vertically integrated big firm manufacturing became globally uncompetitive.  So people left smaller towns because smaller towns offered insufficient jobs to support growth of population or economy.  The narrative that it was the demolition of interesting architecture, and not the drying up of jobs, is silly.  However sinister you try to make your voice sound when you're relating the argument."

They state up front that there isn't a chance of a raise due to raises being frozen.  The actual site you end up at will then dictate the rest of the ups and downs.  It's better suited for students or older folks who don't have money as the #1 priority.  It wasn't for me.

There is always something going on, from music to comedy to performances to sports... the list goes on!  As far as outdoor activities, you're really in luck, in Indiana, because there are a number of state parks within just a 30-60 minute drive, as well as state forests, and even a federal wilderness area.  If you like comedy, the Comedy Attic has a really fantastic weekly lineup - open mic on Wednesdays, and professional comics Thursday-Saturday.  If you like music, there are concerts all over the place, all the time.  Rhino's All Ages club regularly has cool bands, in an alcohol-free environment.  You can also check the calendar on the Herald Times site (one of the few things not behind their paywall) for lists of other events - concerts, gallery openings, etc.  As for actual meetups, /r/bloomington is astonishingly social, for people from the internet.  We have several big ""official"" meetups throughout the year, as well as regular gatherings, such as Cheezburger Wednesday - lunch at the east side Bakehouse on Wednesday noon, for their Burger Wednesday.

And it is more liberal than other towns.  Edit: There are many IU employees who live in the country or other places like Ellettsville and Solsberry because houses are a lot cheaper outside of town (and cheaper still outside of Monroe County). Yes parking is a bit of a pain but you can use the carpool program to get an A permit for half price (some people partner with someone who walks or bikes anyway, then they don't really even have to carpool)."

bloomington,30g0o8,newnamepls,11,Fri Mar 27 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"(relocating)  The lower west side is increasingly popular with students / young working professionals--there's a lot of more upscale subdivisions going up over there that still rely on college kids so prices are pushed down. There are lots of newer places over by the hospital worth looking into. Anything along 2nd street should still be on the city bus route so you can live further out west and still have a clean commute into  downtown.   The Near West Side Neighborhood is directly to the west of downtown / Rogers St between 3rd St and like 6th St-ish. It's a really nice intimate part of town that not a lot of people consider when they're renting, but I lived in a really nice older house there with good management at a great rental rate, and would recommend it. Plus it's basically in downtown, Bloomingfoods is right around the corner, the courthouse square is right up the street—it's just not considered downtown so prices are a lot lower.  If you can stand living among all the students, getting a cheaper apartment near campus like Maxwell Place is a decent option. Over by College Mall there are a lot of older (built early 2000s) complexes that are reasonable places to live, but research the landlords and stay away from Elon Management, they're notoriously shitty. Also Campus Cribs or anything with ""Campus"" in the title, generally.)  The reason you were warned away from the rural outlying areas apart from Bloomington is that Btown is a serious liberal hotbed in an otherwise extremely conservative rural demographic. 15 minutes north of Bloomington is Martinsville, which has a well-documented history of being an extremely racist sundown town. It's still one of the most racist small towns in the entire country, and it's not alone--here's an IDS article describing extreme racism at basketball games in Martinsville (15 mins north) and Bedford (30 mins south) of Bloomington–the two largest towns nearby. When I went to IU I had friends who refused to even drive through Martinsville. (Plus I notice that references to Martinsville being a sundown town are getting deleted off its Wikipedia page as being ""inappropriate"". Stay classy, assholes.)  Elletsville is a nice small town, with its own credit union and weirdly its own internet provider, but you'll be that much further away from everything Bloomington has to offer, and unnecessarily so.  Disclosure: I lived in Bloomington for 12 years including my time as a student there. I last lived there in 2012, so some of this info may be out of date, but as a town, it barely changed at all during the decade I was there so YMMV."
bloomington,30g0o8,bookshop,7,Fri Mar 27 16:29:20 2015 UTC,"Well being from Boston I can see why they said that.  People from cities tend to have culture shock in the small town, rural atmostphere around here.  However, if you have an open mind you will see that people are INSANELY friendly and there is a great sense of community in some of those places.  I've met some very kind people who live in those places.  Unfortunately some of the people who support the Freedom Bill probably live in those places, too though.  But like anywhere, everyone is different.    But I would then say the caveat that Martinsville is the one place that is the most terrible.  Yes you could commute from Indy.  People around here don't do it but I don't really know why.  It's an hour commute with no big city traffic.  You could also take back roads if you wanted, I used to take 135 and 45 and it's really pretty in the summer.  Honestly though, I like Bloomington better than Indy, but people from big cities tend to get used to a certain lifestyle.  In Indy you will be driving everywhere.  In Bloomington you can walk everywhere if you live in town, bike, etc."
bloomington,30g0o8,newnamepls,6,Fri Mar 27 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"My address is technically in Spencer but I live in Ellettsville. I really like it. I'm close enough to the overpass to get onto 37 if need be and I can get to pretty much anywhere in Bloomington within 20 minutes. My husband and I got a great home for the price too. I would not have been able to get the size home for what we paid. It helps on location because I work in ellettsville and he works in Bloomington a few days a week. Overall, I love it but I can see how it wouldn't work for everyone."
bloomington,30g0o8,Rosiesmomma,5,Fri Mar 27 13:23:02 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on the job!  I'm actually going to chime in, in defense of the west side of Bloomington.  In the past several years, there have been a lot of new housing and apartment developments built, and it is NOT all trailer parks and Section 8 housing.  The bonus is that rents are slightly cheaper (if you're going the apartment route), and there are fewer students, volume-wise.  My neighborhood is predominantly professionals, with a few grad students, here and there, and they treat us like adults.  (That's one thing you'll need to look out for, if you're looking to rent in Bloomington - many of the management companies and landlords do August-July leases, and start pestering you to renew for the following August in December.)"
bloomington,30g0o8,kultakala,4,Fri Mar 27 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"Responding to your edit.  Why?  I do the entire opposite,  I live in Bloomington and commute to Indy on a daily basis.  It is 100+ miles a day on my car.  It is long and I have already killed 2 deer and I'm on my second car in the past 7 years doing this commute.  If I could, I would take a job in Bloomington just to avoid the drive."
bloomington,30g0o8,somethingateme,3,Fri Mar 27 23:12:23 2015 UTC,"Note that for the next two years, State Road 37 will be in the process of being rebuilt into I-69.  So any nearby community that requires you to travel on 37 may have an occasionally tough commute.  As others have said, nearby communities will be less expensive -- more house for less money, buying or renting.  Living in-town, I've always had a much better sense of community, more communication with neighbors.  On the other hand, if you're renting in-town there are also plenty of ""student slum"" neighborhoods and apartment complexes where neighbors are loud and facilities have not been ill-treaty by prior tenants."

bloomington,30g0o8,jccalhoun,3,Fri Mar 27 12:48:07 2015 UTC,"I moved here from Boston and have lived here for 5 years. Definitely, definitely live in Bloomington. Indy doesn't offer anything that Bloomington doesn't aside from shopping- the restaurants and bars are just as good or better in Bloomington.  Where you live in town depends on what you like to do and your age- if you're young and single, I think it's worth paying extra to live downtown within walking distance of the bars. If you are not single or don't care about the bar scene or things being in walking distance, there are nice apartments that are less expensive just outside the main downtown area (Bloom Apartments is a good one, there are many others)"
bloomington,30g0o8,slacksonslacks,2,Fri Mar 27 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"I wonder if they meant 'the greater Bloomington area', ya know?  There's nothing wrong with those areas, they are a pretty short hop into Bloomington proper.  Smithville and Elletsville are closest.  Solsberry and Freedom further and a little more rural as a result.  You can get more house for your money in the outlying burgs and still make it into town in around 20 minutes.  It's all good, in the surrounding neighborhoods."

bloomington,30g0o8,newnamepls,2,Fri Mar 27 19:02:54 2015 UTC,"Indianapolis sprawls and is incredibly cookie-cutter, white bread. Really, the whole state is kind of like that: faceless, characteristic-less. Just broadly Midwestern, but not in the sense of Minnesota/Wisconsin/Iowa progressive/farmer–labor/Nordic-ness or marked heavily enough by a Chicago or a Detroit or a Cleveland/Cincy/Columbus. Remember, if anything, that Indiana was almost a border state during the Civil War—hence that gaudy ass pillar in Indianapolis, to make sure people knew we were in the North—and it was the center of the Northern Klan during the '20s.  I'd be bored to tears if I lived in Indianapolis. It's just so bland. It's cheaper, but the public transportation sucks and it's spread out (improvement in one area: it's flat and easier to bike, but Bloomington's hills are rolling and pretty). Foot-for-foot, Bloomington has more for you. Quality over the relative quantity of things to do in two areas with metro area populations ten times removed.  If you're into the small town schtick—and people are: Brown County is full of back-to-Earth hippies, and their high school is a conglomeration of their and redneck's children—just know that people are going to be very conservative. This is a very longtime economically depressed area, so there's that against it, too.  There are hill people who come into Bloomington because it's the closest big town. Some are nice, and some are scagnasty. They aren't my people. Indianapolitans aren't my people. Most Hoosiers aren't my people. A lot of Bloomingtonians are my people."

bloomington,30g0o8,Schmoopster,3,Fri Mar 27 02:56:31 2015 UTC,"If money is tight, I would recommend Orchard Glen on the west side of Bloomington. I lived there myself, for a bit over four years. The rent for a three bedroom 1100 sq town house is about 495. And they pay for the heat! The maintenance crew is on top of it. Repairs get completed within 24 hours of notice. And the best part is that they don't make you sign a lease. Did you get that last part? No lease! So you go on a month to month basis.  It's a great place to start out, because it will give you time to get to know Bloomington  and the surrounding areas for yourself and pick a place of your liking without having to worry about a year long lease just in case the west side isn't your cup of tea.  I don't think you would have any issues there, though. The renters at Orchard Glen are mostly Grad Students and townies. It's pretty quiet. One caveat though, they don't allow pets. Birds and smaller mammals and reptiles are allowed, but no cats and dogs.  I did the Bloomington/Indy drive for five years, and even though I absolutely love driving, and had a fun car to drive, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I've gone to school and lived here since 96 and my husband is a realtor here in town, so we pretty much know the ins and outs of Bloomington and have a lot of connections. Let me know if you need any further information or assistance, I'll be more than happy to help out.  Congrats on your new job :)"

West of downtown is also a good option for you if you find the right area (west of Rogers, between W Kirkwood and 17th).

The drive is fine 99% of the time (assuming no snow or ice). There are the occasional traffic issues, but they are rare, even with the current construction on 37. Now that fuel has come down in price it's not even that expensive. If you are on the south side of Indy, it's reasonable to do the trip in under an hour."

Smaller towns in Indiana aren't bad, they just don't have much going for them.  There are affordable apartments everywhere in Bloomington, you just have to spend time looking. What is your price range? What things are important to you? Do you want to be near downtown or in a suburban setting?  EDIT: Actually I think it's my post you're referencing in your title - I was mostly using hyperbole to express a sentiment a lot of Bloomingtonians feel, but I think I was also considering that you're from Boston and I can't imagine moving from a larger city to a small town in Indiana and being happy.

He didn't seem to have a bunch of pre-canned stories to present. His speech while at times jumbled, made far more sense to me than the well phrased political nothingness I felt coming from the other candidates.

If you're wanting to make a little road trip, you could also always make a little trip up to Fry's in Fishers off of I-69, though to be completely honest the prices won't be that much lower to justify the gas spent to get up there.

Plug in your address at https://bloomington.in.gov/mybloomington to find the day of pickup.  You will need to purchase stickers at any grocery store to put on your trash bag, or put on the outside of your trash container.  Recyclables are free, and the city provides containers.    If you are outside of city limits, you must buy the orange bags and go to one of the recycling centers - http://www.mcswmd.org/centers/index.html.  Bags are available at any grocery store, and come in a ""little"" (Kitchen trash can sized) and Big (35 gallon) size.  Recyclables are free, but must be sorted, but trash needs the orange bags.  You can still take stuff to the recycling centers if you are in city limits, but you will need orange bags.  Also, the recycling centers have a large item drop off for stuff too big to fit in orange bags, but the location rotates between the centers -- check the web site.  The city will pick up large items like couches on their regular run, but you need to put two stickers on them.  Rules and details on the web sites I listed above."

You can take recycling to the country and central center on s walnut, but you can only take orange (trash) bags to the county centers.  My suggestion is buy a roll of orange bags and take trash to the location that has bulky item pickup if needed. Stay away from the trash transfer station south of town. The minium is $25 regardless of weight.  Obviously, if you are in an apartment you won't need the bags, but the bulky item drop off will at least avoid filling up the dumpster for your neighbors."
bloomington,2zwmlp,Unsungbk,2,Mon Mar 23 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"Just another note on the orange trash bags: if you are moving into an apartment complex chances are you won't need them. We live in an apartment and they provide their own trash pickup. They have a large dumpster that gets picked up weekly and we're allowed to dump basically any items in it as long as they fit (aka large furniture, etc.) Also, for recycling we go to the downtown recycling center and just leave our recycling there. They pretty much take all recyclables, you just have to sort it yourself."

Recycled Railroad ties are good for this sort of project.  I've built raised beds from those before, and used them to frame brick decking.  Big box lumber is usually warped all to hell.  Which may be fine for an outdoor project.  But big box will be the best price in non-bulk quantities.  Are you thinking about just doing a bolt straight through?  Finally, are you doing a raised bed?  If so, how high?  My current setup is terraced on the slope of a hill, framed in brick, each terrace is framed in two rows of brick, about 6"" height difference.  It looks good, keeps my soil from eroding and the bricks cost me maybe $.80 apiece."

Just be polite and ready to leave if asked or perhaps questioned, probably not a bad idea to avoid rooms that are clearly marked, in whatever way.  I grew up practicing in those rooms, as a child, my parents had attended but there was never any real issue besides my Father getting loads of parking tickets...

Mine were fairly strong (if you mean the amount of alcohol in them).   I actually liked the taste of the vodka (we sampled some straight before we ordered mixed drinks). It might taste different because they distill grape fermentations with grain, which probably carries over in the flavor of the vodka. I prefer it to most vodka I've tried.  EDIT: Also, just to point out, they have just opened, so I'm willing to grant them some leeway while they nail down good drinks and get products on the menu.

bloomington,2ysnbz,eobanb,23,Thu Mar 12 14:13:00 2015 UTC,So I bitch and moan a lot about how the increase in IU enrollment (by 10s of thousands) and all the resulting development is ruining the charm and small-town feel of Bloomington.  But honestly? Most of these changes show our town's great progress. They create jobs and might even help make our town's  population less transient.  I'm surprised nothing from Walnut between 2nd and 3rd street was shown. That area has improved enormously in the past couple years.

bloomington,2ysnbz,endlessben,3,Thu Mar 12 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, I haven't been back in a few years and see some major changes here. I took a couple of things away from this album - one is that some of the upgrades here are very nice and add to the charm but a lot of them are pretty generic and bland. The other take away is how many trees have been torn out. That makes me sad, I always thought it was one of my favorite things about the campus and the town as a whole is how green it was."
bloomington,2ysnbz,samisaw2,2,Fri Mar 13 07:54:40 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you OP for posting this. We all know Bloomington is dear to all of our hearts. One reason it's such a great town and campus is because there is always so much going on, like all these transformations. I've only been here on and off for 4 years and I've seen quite a lot change in such a short amount of time. Some good and some bad. I do appreciate the time and effort by IU put into the detail and construction of the beautiful new limestone campus buildings (cost and tuition is a separate argument not for this post), and many of the town projects are progressive and aesthetically pleasing such as the b-line overhaul and the new bloomingfoods  on the south side of campus.  Some things I/we do not agree with though, such as removing trees, which in Bloomington are basically sacred to both us students and you town folks. There's a reason why it's called Bloomington. You'll see in a few weeks. So what I'm saying is that it's okay to continue these projects, but it's important for whoever is in charge of these projects to focus not necessarily on (economical) growth but improving the quality of existing structures (renovation, etc) and being careful about developing on new land. Some of the new apartment building are not so attractive, and kind of takes away from the magic of Bloomington."

It really depends on your neighbors when it comes to noise, but generally it only gets bad on the weekends. Like someone already said, being on the 6 bus route is nice.  As for the internet/cable/water being provided, it depends on what you'll want out of your internet. Generally, anything they provide is rather shitty for online gaming or streaming or things of that nature. Then again, I pay $60 a month for internet and it's only so-so...my experience with internet providers in Btown is less than stellar."

That was cool.  On site laundry wasn't that great, but if you've got some schoolwork to do or a book to read it's not a big deal to go to one of the bigger laundry facilities in town.

That's when I got the brilliant idea to cross Hillside, turn into Renwick, and weave around the other side of the roundabout.  Unfortunately, both the entrance and exit of Renwick were blocked too, by the dummies driving in reverse down the hill, and on the sidewalk, respectively.  After witnessing that, I'm not even sure why I attempted Winslow.  I knew that hill would be a death trap, and when I got to the top of it and saw police lights at the bottom, I NOPE'd the hell around."

If it's a 40-foot monster you'll probably get noticed very quickly.  Another possibility is Wal-Mart, although it's entirely up to the store manager, and I really doubt you would be able to stay there for more than 3-4 days.  I think that your best bet is find a friend with some private property."

bloomington,2xtv55,littlebunnyfu,6,Wed Mar 4 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"Yes they do.  The HT doesn't do much reporting, nor does it foster reporting or journalism from the inside.  The HT (and all other papers owned by the same company) are there for one reason, and one reason only.  To squeeze as much profit as possible to it's benefactors.  Several years ago, an internal source told me that they had 10 year old computers which were on their last legs, there was no replacement plan.  As a matter of fact, the hope was to squeeze at least 10 more years out of them.  WHAT?  That is the attitude about all things at the HT, squeeze as much as possible out of everything.  So yes, IMO - complete and utter ""shitholes."""

And if you missed 2 days for ANY reason, they canned you. I was in a class of 9. 4 of them ragequit halfway through the first shift. Walked out.  The worst was the metal detectors. You had to empty your pockets of everything. No big deal. AND take off your belt. And the bathrooms were on the outside of the detectors. So, me wearing a belt, had to take off my belt and stuff out of my pockets 9 times per night.  I'd say good riddance. Everyone there was a perma-temp, guess who through: Employment Plus.  And this really goes home considering my posting and ""interesting comments"" in this reddit    Edit: The actual job was a few fold. Phones came in. There were a few jobs: SIM/microSD card remover, Charger, wiper, Q/A (what I did), and Final Q/A.  Q/A or quality assurance; I ended up going through 2000 phones a night: checking for damage, data, cards left inside device, and other really stupid things. We only were allowed 30 seconds per phone. We had to be able to tell if data was still on any type of phone, regardless the OS. And that's really tough, given that some phones don't have a wipe function. The worst is the task-master style of management, where either absence, not following conflicting management directions, or the computer could fire you. And you wouldn't find out until about 3pm the next day, when someone from Employment Plus would call you.   Yeah, just fuck them."

It was also an incredibly easy job. All you needed to do was show up -- much better than a fast food job imo.  I wouldn't say good riddance because now you have 320 people who couldn't find a better job.

Incompetence at the top and just turtles (and racist, sexist nepotism) all the way down. Constant boom-bust mentality, with periods of cut hours sandwiched between frantic mandatory overtime. No realistic odds at a hire-on, even once the ""hiring freeze"" ended. Completely unrealistic production goals that they refused to re-evaluate. I will say this: I liked the people I worked with. The people I worked for, on the other hand, were almost to a one obfuscating, self-serving blowhards. And I left on good terms! (and that's the M-PTS side; the Select reps were often hostile and rude such that I basically never interacted with them if I could avoid it)  To their credit (in some minuscule, undeserved way) they started firing some of the production managerial staff responsible for the ridiculous swings in incoming product and the constant missed deadlines back in November.

Even when I'm not feeling well enough to do any hard core hiking and camping, I like to drive out to the fire tower and enjoy the view, then walk out to one of the cemeteries, or something.

Shameless plugs for Uel Zing, Beck Salon, Wicks Wheels, Hopscotch, Magnetic South...probably forgetting a couple.  Bands. If you can play music, start a band. If you can't play music, learn. If you don't want to play music, go to shows. If you're poor, go to house shows.  Volunteer. Places like Pages to Prisoners, Mother Hubbard's Cupboard, Habitat, etc often need help. There's a variety of city and county commissions you can serve on too, or at least show up to and provide citizen input.  Drinking and going out to eat. Living here for years gives you time to sample basically every restaurant and bar in town."

It's a fun thing to do with an interesting and diverse group of people. Geocaching is a fun way to find new spots around town.  You can download the app, it's helpful.  It's $9.99 I think, but totally worth it.  There are a lot of coffee shops to hang out at.   If I feel like being out of the house, sometimes I just go to read.  My 3 favorite spots are Pourhouse, Hopscotch, and bakehouse.  Wine and canvas is something I've never tried but have been wanting to! There is also bowling alley, movie theater, skating rink, ice skating rink, and drive in theater  Oh! And there is also a pretty active music scene in Bloomington.   If you haven't been to Boxcar Books, it's definitely a place worth checking out.  There, you can also pick up a Lets Go! Calendar that has various shows as events going on during the month."

Attend New Volunteer Orientation Meeting (first Saturday of each month at 11am). Attend RADIO BASICS class with Richard Fish, any Sunday at 8pm. Attend MIXOLOGY 101 class with Jim Manion, which is offered once a month, usually on the third Sunday of each month, 6-8pm. The next Mixology 101 is [removed; the last one was this past Sunday].  Do at least one eTown/Sound Opinions BOARD OPERATOR/ANNOUNCER shift on a Sunday, 6pm-8pm. SHADOW live DJ during music programming. First week, just observe. In following weeks, do some announcing and get hands-on experience. If approved to do so by Music Director, begin SUBBING for scheduled DJs needing sub DJ for music program. Discuss genre and day-part preferences with Music Director and keep abreast of show openings. Keep Music Director informed of your progress through this training track.    Rich, who holds Radio Basics, can be reached at fish@lodestone-media.com - email him and watch him work his serious magic on Firehouse Theater. To RSVP for Mixology 101 email music@wfhb.org.

People generally assume you go there if you show up, so finding them is really the only issue. You might have to ask people who go to IU about ones that may be specific to your interests, but once you're there you should be able to take part in whatever that club does.  The IMU has free movies Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. It's free for IU students and $2 for non-IU students. If you find someone who goes to IU to go with then they can get you in for free as well. They're not super new movies, but they're fairly recent and are a good deal at that price.  Outside of the university there's a lot to do. I'd suggest doing some volunteer work with an organization you find interesting. Here's a link to the Bloomington Volunteer Network. That should help you find something to meet new people at while helping the community."

It's something most people can do, although you may be sore the next day. Serious competitiveness is discouraged and we welcome all fitness levels.

Heck, you could post, ""I'll be at XYZ at such-and-such time - anyone care to join?"" and you'll probably attract at least one person.  If you haven't, already, I highly recommend joining our Facebook group - a lot of social planning goes on, there.

If you don't see a foot path, mark your path with brightly colored ribbon.   Going to the quarries( any of them) is on private property and illegal.  You're unlikely to get in trouble if you are sober and only intend to look around.  If you're caught and your only intention is obviously to take some pictures, they'll probably just tell you to go home."
bloomington,2wlmej,NerdusMaximus,15,Fri Feb 20 23:14:25 2015 UTC,"Bloomington Transit has a dedicated Braun high top fleet for special needs passengers. Was the bus you rode equipped with a wheelchair lift? I am not affiliated with Bloomington Transit directly, but I used to live in Bloomington anf was pretty impressed with the the transit system, especially for a town of that size. I also happen to work in the paratransportation industry and have seen the BT paratransit vehicles, which are different than their standard fleet. I do not recall riding a Bloomington Transit bus on one of their regular routes equipped with a lift. I am not sure if their special needs units run regular routes or by request or both, but I would imagine that this was the reason the driver could not pick up the passenger. Of course if the bus is equipped with a lift, it could have been out of order, but they typically do not have trouble working in cold weather. The driver might be required to operate the lift from the outside of the bus, which might explain why this happened. Some people are lazy or just bad people, but sometimes shitty situations occur for perfectly legitimate reasons. I'm not sure which happened here, but I thought I'd provide some perspective. Managing a fleet of buses is extraordinarily difficult. They are basically driving houses, and things break down often. All things considered, Bloomington has an excellent transportation system, IMHO, but things may have changed since I left town."
bloomington,2wlmej,WTFisTweeting,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"The person I helped has been in Bloomington for 5+ years, and was pretty agile with a smaller wheelchair. She said that she can use the buses with (usually) no problems, except when the weather gets cold (again, according to the person I was helping). I think the buses have a system lower down the right side of the bus and extends a slight ramp to the curb.   My post assumes that the person I was helping was telling the truth. Given the tone and manner I saw the bus driver talking to her, I will believe what she said about the BT system. I know that these systems are hard to manage, but I found it particularly difficult to swallow the situation given the current weather conditions."
bloomington,2wlmej,caimen,4,Sat Feb 21 04:19:22 2015 UTC,"I've been riding with Bloomington Transit probably about 5 years now.  I've only very rarely seen the lifts not work properly, but never due to weather conditions.  Generally I've always been impressed at how well they work no matter what the condition is.    Once I got downtown to the old transfer station and the entire system was shut down due to a massive ice storm.  Since many were stuck downtown, several employees took the Bloomington Transit SUVs to ferry the people back home.  I got a ride home from the general manager who seemed like a genuine caring person.  Not sure if the same manager is still there or not.  If a lift doesn't work, there isn't much option for them.  You can't simply lift a wheel chair and get a person onto a bus without a lift.  What they should do however is request the manager come give the person a ride which is what I've seen happen before.  There are certainly some bad bus drivers occasionally, but in my experience the bad ones tend to not last very long.  I've only reported one driver before and they were probably gone within a month likely because enough people complained.  The biggest problem the system has is for the blind where for whatever reason bus drivers don't call out stops or voice system that is supposed to call out stops either doesn't work or is turned off.  I know the paper ran a story about this probably a year or so ago and the problem was partially addressed for a while.  It seems some buses have the voice system while others don't.  I certainly wouldn't judge the entire system off of one experience, I would however call and report it.  They can't fix what they don't know about."

I initially offered a ride while the bus was there, but she said she would be fine and would be able to figure it out. I drove by to double check that she had got on the bus, and saw that she was left behind. I'll try and get in contact with her and see if she knows the information (though through my conversation, she says Bloomington Transit is already quite familiar with her)."
bloomington,2wlmej,kybandy,4,Fri Feb 20 23:39:15 2015 UTC,"They might be familiar with her, but it often helps to have someone else speak on your behalf. Especially when complaints have already been filed multiple times without much action. If you get the proper information, you should report it, if only to help others that might have experienced this but didn't feel comfortable/able to speak out about it."

Also check out the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that transit buses be wheelchair accessible."
bloomington,2wlmej,lord_james,3,Sat Feb 21 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"Just for the sake of posterity... this isn't true. I've ridden BT for ten years and I've only ever seen a person in a wheelchair being denied once because of overcrowding. It was the 9 bus (C back then) so they had to wait maybe an extra ten minutes.  I was on the bus just this morning, in fact, and a person in a wheelchair was able to board with no trouble.  The incident you witnessed was unfortunate and the driver unprofessional, maybe, but in no way represents the activity of the majority of drivers the majority of the time."
bloomington,2wlmej,hamfriend,2,Sun Feb 22 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"That's weird. I drive campus bus, and we're discouraged from using the ramps unless necessary. But we are not supposed to deny entry."

bloomington,2w7zkh,mexter,5,Wed Feb 18 00:04:35 2015 UTC,"I am a former TJ's employee, also a former Bloomingfoods employee. Bfoods has no great sway with city council or BZA ( board of zoning appeal) and while TJ's might have considered it, this town is not their demo. It really is that simple, even if Bfoods protested a TJ's, having seen as many government meetings as I have, I can assure you there is very little the could do to actually prevent it.  Do you guys really think Bfoods was able to defeat the billion dollar multinational Aldi foods (which owns TJ's) from moving in miles away on the Westside (which is where it was rumored to go) but couldn't do the same with the much smaller Whole Foods, just a few blocks from their main store? I know you want a TJ's near, so do I, but blaming Bfoods is a bit silly. All the talk here is wildly under informed."

bloomington,2w7zkh,mexter,1 point,Wed Feb 18 12:49:47 2015 UTC,"Whole Foods would be more of a competitor to Kroger/Marsh, and Bloomingfoods to a lessor extent.  Trader Joe's is a ""we sell what we can get for cheap"" type of place, meaning you can't just expect to do all you shopping there.  TJ's buys overstock or whatever it can get that's both good and for whatever reason cheap, then brands it as Trader Joe's brand.  You can't expect TJ's to have the same stuff month to month.  In that sense it is closer to Aldai than Whole Foods.  Whole Foods on the other hand is full service grocery.  It's basically just an upscale Kroger/Marsh with more organics, but not everything in the store is organic.  Bloomingfoods isn't really in this category either, because if they can't get it organic or local or whatever they just won't have it, making it difficult to shop at JUST Bloomingfoods.   They would compete with Bloomingfoods for the healthfood/organic market, but they'd mainly compete with Kroger/Marsh as a full grocery."
bloomington,2w7zkh,persistent_illusion,2,Wed Feb 18 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It absolutely competes with Bloomingfoods on just about every level, and competes with Kroger on virtually none. WF is mostly organic / gmo free, similar to Bloomingfoods. Kroger is mostly conventional with a bit of low end organic thrown in for good measure.   As for trader Joe's, It's not an overstock reseller. They have their own supply chains, and their products are too consistent to be overstock.   Bloomingfoods carries many non organic products. Probably about 1/3 of their produce and bulk sections."

They've got an effective monopoly on university students who don't plan ahead and need an interview/graduation suit.  A much better value involves driving up to Greenwood, to the Men's Wearhouse.  They usually have specials you can take advantage of where you can get good deals on stuff that is the same basic quality as Andrew Davis.  They do in-house tailoring (which is why you buy any suit for more than $100, honestly, the fit is the only reason other than social norms to wear a suit).  And they usually have a program where they give you $50 in store credit for every $500 you spend- which amounts to another tie or possibly a shirt if they're having a special.  I'm also super down with giving my money to the company, which is one of the few that will hire ex-felons.  The CEO, a recovering alcoholic himself, makes it a point."

bloomington,2vo6pk,skywritert,2,Thu Feb 12 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"Buy a good white shirt from Andrew Davis. It'll last you a LONG time if you take good care of it and don't change sizes often. Expect to spend $100, give or take. If you want good fitting clothes but have a more realistic budget... go to Kohls or some of the other department stores, and look for shirt patterns you like that are on sale/in your price range and then take them to a seamstress/tailor and have them tailored to you. I did this and it cost maybe an extra $5-10 a shirt, and it looks like you paid $100+ for a custom fit."

UITS is harder to get into but if you know your way around photoshop and or majoring in IT with some technical work in your resume you should be good to go.

There was a crazy wreck just south of Tapp... 3 cars appeared to be involved: A truck was rear ended with a bumper stuck up under it, a Buick with the rear end completely mangled, and then the weirdest one - a small 4 door clear across the highway in a ditch in on the northbound side. How the hell that got there is the real mystery, there weren't really any skid marks on the grass median, just on the northbound side. Everyone appeared to be out of their vehicles and ok. Some pics for the curious(I wasn't rubbernecking, traffic just wasn't moving.)  http://i.imgur.com/ukI3Opl.jpg http://i.imgur.com/KsPSV3Q.jpg  Edit: Herald-Times article = pure craziness:  A three-car accident sent two cars into ditches along opposite sides of Ind. 37 and brought traffic to a halt between Tapp Road and Fullerton Pike for about 30 minutes early Friday evening. Two drivers were taken to the hospital for treatment of injuries, according to Sgt. Brandon Hudson of the Bloomington Fire Department. A blue passenger car crashed into two cars that had slowed in a southbound lane, he explained. The initial crash sent a tan passenger car, with heavy back end damage, into a ditch, while the other car sustained minimal damage. The driver of the blue passenger car managed to put his car into reverse and the throttle stuck, sending the car across the median of the highway, across both lanes of northbound traffic and into a ditch, Hudson said. Emergency responders were initially dispatched to a report of a car accident and subsequent car fire at 4:21 p.m. A tire was smoldering, an airbag had deployed and some grass in a ditch caught fire, Hudson said. Members of the Bloomington Fire Department, Bloomington Police Department, Monroe County Sheriff’s Office, Perry Clear Creek Fire Department and IU Health Bloomington Hospital Ambulance Service assisted at the scene. Emergency responders blocked and rerouted traffic in the southbound lanes of Ind. 37 at Tapp Road and in the northbound lanes and Fullerton Pike."

bloomington,2u8dzz,riftybusiness9989,7,Fri Jan 30 20:16:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for me and purposes of my usual business in downtown Bloomington, I have no problems with the parking meters. In fact, I find them to be a huge improvement over the prior arrangement. Before the parking meters were in place, it was often difficult in my experience to find parking spaces downtown or in the 4th Street restaurant area when meeting with friends or visiting local businesses. This has improved dramatically since the new meter installations. And really, is $1/h that bad? I'd understand if the rates were significantly higher, say $3-4/h, but asking for a dollar to park somewhere for an hour doesn't seem out of line.  If I had to make some changes, I suppose it would be nice to see some extended hours on free parking or maybe discounted rates during summer/winter break since demand goes down dramatically with the exodus of students. Maybe create a few more collections of parking spots if possible (not necessarily parking garages, I think there are plenty of those as is). I dunno, I just have few qualms remaining with downtown parking I guess."
bloomington,2u8dzz,secef,4,Sat Jan 31 17:31:35 2015 UTC,"Yah, the summer and winter break period is especially ridiculous.

bloomington,2u8dzz,Yalzin,3,Sat Jan 31 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"The mayor already said recently that there will be changes coming.  If I remember correctly, they're going to change the metered-hours from 8am-10pm, to 10am-8pm, which I think is needed.  Also I believe he said the credit ""fee"" for using a card is going to be eliminated.  One other improvement I wish they'd consider is allowing credit card to purchase less than an hour of parking.  I almost never have change on me, and it does get aggravating if I need to stop somewhere downtown unexpectedly for ~10 minutes and end up paying for an hour."
bloomington,2u8dzz,Destroyer23,2,Mon Feb 2 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"Free parking on Saturdays would be nice or more free lots for those willing to walk a block or two.  The real problem is that our downtown is pretty meh. It's OK for restaurants and there are more than enough bars, but we're losing interesting shops and other attractions faster than they are being replaced. I can't remember the last time I decided to just go wonder around downtown for a few hours. I was however pretty good about going downtown to buy something if it was available there - paying more to support local businesses in the hopes of making a better downtown. And I stopped that cold turkey when the parking meters were put in. I thought I was the one doing Bloomington a favor only to find out Bloomington thought it was the one doing me a favor. So we agreed to disagree and went our separate ways and local businesses pay the price."
bloomington,2u8dzz,arstin,5,Tue Feb 17 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"Two things:  First, I would like to see demand-based pricing à la SFpark. The idea is that when demand is lower, pricing is lower; when demand is higher, pricing is higher. The cost would vary both depending on the time of day/month/year, and by location.  In terms of time, especially when students are gone, parking would be free or nearly-free. At peak times, and in peak locations, it would be more expensive, in order to nearly guarantee at least one free space on any block.  For example, with 50% of spaces taken you could price it at $0.25 or $0.50 an hour; with 90% of spaces taken you could price it at, say, $3/hr, so that if someone really needed/wanted it, they could pay for it.  Some people don't like this idea (either because they don't like even the possibility of paying $4/hr even if most of the time parking is free [or cheaper than it is currently], and/or because they imagine parking should be some kind of egalitarian public resource) but the fact is that there is a certain supply, a certain demand, nothing in life is free, and you need to balance all of those things.  Second, I would also like the ability to see available spaces on a website/app, which would majorly decrease the amount of cruising around looking for a space."
bloomington,2u8dzz,eobanb,13,Fri Jan 30 22:10:29 2015 UTC,Fuck 3-4$ an hour parking. This is the midwest. Get rid of the fucking meters and just enforce 2 hour/1 hour/ 20 min/ etc laws effectively
bloomington,2u8dzz,NolaHoosier,0,Fri Jan 30 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, application of the philosophy of ""nothing in life is free"" is arbitrary and irrational here.  While yes, there are externalities generated by something like maintaining space for public parking, internalizing those externalities are secondary to the chief aim of the current parking policy, which is the generation of revenue for the city above and beyond the cost of parking operations.  Like most of the other revenue structures in the city, it's aimed at students and the parents of students- both because it's more palatable to derive revenue from people who don't vote here, and because it's also necessary to derive revenue from people who take advantage of city services without contributing a lot to the tax base.  My fundamental problem with the view is that certain kinds of parking, say, that within the vicinity of city hall and the courthouse, needs to be affordable for certain kinds of basic public services to be accessible.  To give an example- parking is already a substantial burden for many of the low-income clients who come to the Counsel in the Court walk-in legal clinic.  These aren't relatively affluent young professionals, and $4/hr parking would be prohibitively expensive to them.  And if prohibitively expensive parking dissuades them from accessing the court, city hall, other organs of their local government (and it already does at $1/hr), then there are serious problems with what you're proposing.  In some jurisdictions, maybe even Constitutional problems."
bloomington,2u8dzz,hamfriend,1 point,Sat Jan 31 05:25:31 2015 UTC,"Like most of the other revenue structures in the city, it's aimed at students and the parents of students-   How so?   it's more palatable to derive revenue from people who don't vote here, and because it's also necessary to derive revenue from people who take advantage of city services without contributing a lot to the tax base.   I think more the latter than the former. Bloomington faces major difficulties with street maintenance because it has many more drivers than a non-university city for the size of its tax base."
bloomington,2u8dzz,ishouldnotbeonreddit,2,Sun Feb 8 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"Many of the revenue streams in town are aimed at students and parents rather than residents.  A few examples that come immediately to mind- Trash stickers on a per bag transaction rather than sourced from property taxes, a lot of the court dispositions on landlord/tenant disputes (overwhelmingly favoring the landlord, a resident, over the tenant, a student) upon which a premium is collected in higher investment property taxes, then quite a lot in the form of excise fines and enforcement.  The county prosecutor makes a tidy business off of those $300-$400 public intox or underage diversions or classes, so much so that it is a major revenue stream.  None of which to say that the practice is bad.  As I said, if a politician can raise revenue without raising the taxes of the people who vote in local elections, then there's a lot of incentive there.  And it's reasonably justified to pay for the services that students come here to use.  There are downsides, too, like for those students who don't have parental funding, navigating revenue streams deliberately set up to bleed out of town money into city coffers.  But generally the balance is reasonable."

If you want to improve mobility and access to government services for poor people (or really, everyone) then improve public transportation. If someone can't afford one dollar to park somewhere then they can't really afford a car in general."
bloomington,2u8dzz,eobanb,6,Sat Jan 31 05:45:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you may want to re-check your analysis of constitutional doctrine.  There are viable Due Process and Equal Protection claims arising from imposing undue burdens or creating outright barriers of access to public services, especially courthouses, generally developing out of the Tennessee v. Lane line of cases.  The exact issue hasn't been litigated in Indiana, but the argument is there, moreover, the underlying policy is sound.  I'm all for improving public transportation, but it's a bit of a red herring here in this discussion.  And there are plenty of people who, yes, cannot afford one dollar an hour (which usually amounts to 5 or so hours if they're pursuing business with the court), but who can, as you say, afford a car.  Several of my office's clients who come in to the walk-in legal clinic, for example, are homeless but still have vehicles.  Many others are totally indigent but still have vehicles, whether because they are elderly on a fixed income and a car is a remainder from their working years, or their already meager wages are heavily garnished because they're in the soup with creditors but they need their car to get to work.  Generally the kinds of cars they tend to drive are unaffordable money pits, but as much as they can't afford the car, they can afford not having the car even less; car expenses are almost always a part of pretty every bankruptcy case I've seen (I see most of those that my office handles in house).  And maxing a credit card to keep a junkpile running is sometimes a different proposition than having cash on hand to pay parking.  Overall, I don't think that the convenience of affluent people makes a compelling argument to potentially levy a $20 parking tab on somebody pursuing redress through a court."
bloomington,2u8dzz,hamfriend,1 point,Sat Jan 31 08:03:35 2015 UTC,"I had not heard of Tennessee v. Lane before, but a cursory reading of it reveals it's an ADA case about a wheelchair user who couldn't access the upper floor of a courthouse. Really has little/nothing to do with $1/hr parking downtown.  And yet public transportation is the 'red herring' here? lol"
bloomington,2u8dzz,eobanb,1 point,Mon Feb 2 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"The case is usually covered in Constitutional Law, 1L second semester, as an anchor case for substantive due process doctrine, establishing that judicial recognition of certain suspect classes, even otherwise borderline suspect classes like indigence or disability, waxes full as it approaches certain kinds of fundamental rights like voting or accessing the courts.  An identical fact pattern is unnecessary for making a parallel due process argument that the creation of a relevant, substantial barrier which precludes access to courts for a particular group of people violates the 14th amendment.  Just as no elevator precludes access to the court for disabled persons, prohibitively expensive parking precludes access to courts for an indigent person.  Thus triggering due process and equal protection constitutional claims, like the one successfully pursued in Tennessee v. Lane.  That would be the legal argument I would bring.  In fact it is the legal argument I researched for a local advocacy group, and am currently discussing with one of the members of the Bloomington City Council in an effort to work out some sort of system of parking validation for indigent visitors to the court."

They have open mic nights on Wednesdays, and the people who performed before us all had acoustic guitars, so I would imagine that's the kind of vibe they support.  The Vid is pretty nice, if you don't mind hipsters. No dubstep, seems like they're usually playing classic rock and normal pop shit.

Max's will be closing after January 17th. Yeah, I really mean closing. Sudden? Yes.  Super Bummed? And how. It's been a tough time trying to keep up with the bills after the parking meters and the general rough life of a small business, so we'll be closed Sunday Jan. 18th and onward. The building will get some crazy upgrades and add-ons and re-dos and will probably re-open as a fantastic new something-or-other in 2016. But you know what that means? Party to end it all!  Half off everything on Friday and Saturday! Free shows! Our last show will be Solid State Physics, Cool Ranch, and Coyote Sundown on Saturday.

We love you all! -Max's   From Indiana Public Media:    Lyle Feigenbaum, owner of Scholar’s Inn Bakehouse located downtown, says the six months since the installation of the meters have been the roughest months in his professional career...“The effect has been beyond my wildest dreams. I never anticipated it would be this devastating,” Feigenbaum says.   From the Indiana Daily Student:    John McGuigan, an employee at Caveat Emptor Used Books said the new parking meters are a “disaster.”  ... “We and other businesses have already seen a significant drop-off in sales,” he said. “Customers have been coming in and complaining about it.”"

This is annoying as a broke college student to have to check my account every time I use my card to make sure I'll have enough money in there for whenever they decide to finally cash the checks.  Also they told us we could move in earlier than what they made the lease for and then told us that that was a early as they would go.   Plus side is that they have fair priced properties.

They both work throughout the year, though they have income guidelines to make sure that limited resources go to people who really need them.  There are also walk-in legal clinics in Monroe and surrounding counties- Bloomington's is every Friday, 10 AM through 12:30 PM for family law, 1:30-3:30 for consumer law (or any other civil legal issue).  There's no income screening for walk-in, but it's usually advice, drafting documents, etc. and not full representation.  I'm a law student, myself, going into public interest law along the lines of these organizations.  These days, even a lot of ostensibly middle class folks can't afford an attorney when they need one, and a lot of the legalzoom type services are good for some things, but a pale substitute for real representation for a lot of others.  I think that every opportunity to correct the market back to affordability without diluting service is good for everybody, lawyers too (though a lot of my contemporaries who make the big bucks may not agree).

From what I've read, all of the pretty extensive research done on MSG fails to establish any correlation between consumption and ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"".  What you're describing sounds like the mythical reactions attributed to MSG, not a typical allergenic/immuno response.  MSG itself isn't an allergen, either, rather, its constituent components of glutamate acid and salt would be- though both substances are vital nutrition.  I say this not to second-guess what may be an actual allergy you have, but to better frame the answer.  If your reaction is psychosomatic (which still may not lessen the severity or unpleasantness of the reaction) then all Chinese food might be a no-go.  I'd also look at if you tend to eat canned vegetables, soups, broths or meats, as these often have high levels of glutemates to mitigate already sky-high sodium content.  You also tend to see a lot of glutamates in very savory cuisines- personally my favorite way to add them into dishes are konbu and porcini.  All that said, Chow Bar is probably the most authentic, least Americanized Chinese in town.  But even they might use MSG, as it's often used a lot even in very authentic cooking as a stand-in for the umami flavors of konbu, dashi, and other naturally occurring glutamates."

I love Chow Bar, but it is nowhere close to authentic Chinese cuisine. Lucky Express is often filled only with Asians. Not sure if they're still open, though. If you don't have Chinese taste buds, you might not enjoy their food since all the Szechuan peppercorn is an acquired taste.  Everything else you've said is spot on."
bloomington,2scrs3,phound,6,Wed Jan 14 09:39:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with Lucky Express, the place is very good and authentic. I also recommend Lotus Garden, it's not as well known because it's on 17th so a bit farther off campus but they also have good authentic food.

My experience and preference comes from the old owner (who I guess was some kind of big pop star in Mongolia), ordering off the menu in Chinese (one of my friends from undergrad).

bloomington,2s9ayv,popeguilty,3,Tue Jan 13 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Legal status of article  Garbage picking:       Since dumpsters are usually located on private premises, divers may occasionally get in trouble for trespassing while dumpster diving, though the law is enforced with varying degrees of rigor. Dumpster diving is often not prohibited by law. Abandonment of property is another principle of law that applies to recovering materials via dumpster diving.  Police searches of dumpsters as well as similar methods are also generally not considered violations; evidence seized in this way has been permitted in many criminal trials. The doctrine is not as well established in regards to civil litigation.  Companies run by private investigators specializing in dumpster diving have emerged as a result of the need for discreet, undetected retrieval of documents and evidence for civil and criminal trials. Private investigators have also written books on ""P.I. technique"" in which dumpster diving or its equivalent ""wastebasket recovery"" figures prominently.   In the United States, the 1988 California v. Greenwood case in the U.S. Supreme Court held that there is no common law expectation of privacy for discarded materials. [non-primary source needed] There are, however, limits to what can legally be taken from a company's refuse. In a 1983 Minnesota case involving the theft of customer lists from a garbage can, Tennant Company v. Advance Machine Company (355 N.W.2d 720), the owner of the discarded information was awarded $500,000 in damages.  Dumpster diving in England and Wales may qualify as theft within the Theft Act 1968  or as common-law theft in Scotland, though there is very little enforcement in practice. In Italy, a law issued in 2000 declared dumpster diving to be legal. In Germany, a dumpster's contents are regarded as the property of the dumpster's owner. Therefore, taking items from a dumpster is viewed as theft. Be that as it may, the police will routinely disregard the illegality of dumpster diving seeing as the items found are generally of low value. There has only been one known instance where divers were to be prosecuted: the individuals were arrested on assumed burglary as they had surmounted a supermarket's fence which was then followed by a theft complaint by the owner.  In Canada, The Trespass to Property Act [citation needed] - legislation dating back to the British North America Act of 1867 - grants property owners and security guards the power to ban anyone from their premises, for any reason, permanently. This is done by issuing a notice to the intruder, who will only be breaking the law upon return. A recent case in Canada, which involved a police officer who retrieved a discarded weapon from a trash receptacle as evidence, created some controversy. The judge ruled the policeman's actions as legal although there was no warrant present, which led some to speculate the event as validation for any Canadian citizen to raid garbage disposals.  In 2009, a Belgian dumpster diver and eco-activist nicknamed Ollie was detained for a month for dumpster diving, and was accused of theft and burglary. On February 25, 2009, Ollie was arrested for taking food from a dumpster at an AD Delhaize supermarket in Bruges. His trial evoked protests in Belgium against restrictions from taking discarded food items.

That day we got trashed and turned a box spring into a couch( it was awful). He never complained, we got him food and he got us our booze for the day, with our money of course. He stayed that night at my house(long story I was unsupervised). The next day, he told me his story. He had freaked out and just ran away from his wife and kids one day, never planing on going back. The day he had spent with us reminded him what it was like to have family and friends. He cried a bit and asked for a ride to the bus station in Bloomington, to go home. We took him and I gave him my phone number told him to call sometime. A few months later he called from his home, it was right around Christmas.

Can anyone offer any insight? I've always thought you can do a lot of good by donating directly to some organization with a good reputation. There's no telling what happens when you ""spare a few bucks"" to the cardboard crew."
bloomington,2s38hx,ulsanforyou,5,Sun Jan 11 21:47:06 2015 UTC,"If they're anything like the ones in Indianapolis (and I suspect they are), they could be either part of a scammer ring, or just independent scammers.  I remember seeing a news bit, a few years back, where they watched this one guy for a week, and saw him get picked up in an Escalade, and followed him to Carmel, where he lived with his wife in a really nice house. It turns out he found he could get up to $1000 a week (tax-free) by panhandling at highway ramps, and so the two of them would pick different ramps and considered that their full-time job.  (""If I can get people to just give me money, why should I work for the man?"")  I've seen the same group of people at the 37/W. 3rd offramp, W. 3rd by the Bob Evans, Pete Ellis and E. 3rd, and Clarizz and E. 3rd over the past couple of years.  Their signs change, and are always ripped-up pieces of cardboard boxes.  ""Stranded need to get home to Indy,"" ""Girlfriend sick can't work plz HELP,"" ""Came for work cant find job,"" ""Car broke down need to get home to Lafayette,"" ""No job, need help,"" ""Hungry, God Bless.""  One year, a couple of them brought out a toddler at the Clarizz spot, in the middle of summer, when it was about 106 degrees outside.  (I think they actually got arrested for that one.)"

He told me he was a dairy farmer and he'd run out of gas taking a tanker truck full of milk to market.  His credit card was unexpectedly declined and if he didn't get some money for gas he'd be out thousands of dollars.  So, I gave him five bucks and went on my way.  Three years later I saw the same guy at the same gas station telling the same story and I told him to go suck a bag of dicks."

Rather than give him money, I pointed at a nearby station and told him to meet me there with his car in a couple minutes. I put a few bucks worth in his car for him and he seemed really grateful.

If you're parking downtown, you can easily walk from the Scholar's Inn Bakehouse to BluBoy. If you have an ice pack and cooler, or something else that can keep frozen stuff cold, you can go to Bloomingfoods a short walk away from the downtown Bakehouse, and pick up some ice cream made by Chocolate Moose (and if she's vegan, then she probably remembers their vegan ice cream). And when you go to Buffa Louie's, you'll be close to the IU Visitor Centre, where you can quickly pick up some IU merchandise. You might also want to pick up some Oliver Wine, which is made in Bloomington. You'll pass the winery on your way into town, but if you don't want to stop there, you can go straight to Kroger, passing the downtown area, and there will be one on your right a few blocks later.

bloomington,2rfg9w,redditaccount01423,5,Tue Jan 6 03:19:04 2015 UTC,"My story is posted somewhere here on reddit. They took our deposit and still charged us $2000. They fined us for everything. When I moved in, there were cockroaches, I said I wouldn't sign the lease until they hired an exterminator. They said it was by responsibility to get rid of pests. We were fined for the roaches, the exterminator, then $400 more because I was an ""illegal tenant."" And that was just the first month. There were fines every. Single. Fucking. Month."

I've never met anybody as awful as the owner, and her daughter is a lawyer and is in the same building, so let that speak for itself. I was always very nice and polite to them, and they just kept fucking up and screwing me over."

Your best bet really is to drive around neighborhoods looking for signs, and to keep a watch on craigslist.  Good places like you're looking for aren't really advertised much and get snatched up quick so you need to stay vigilant to increase your odds.

I took my car in because a rust bubble was coming up from under the paint on the hood - and their own body shop guy said it was due to the clip that holds the hood closed rusting away and eating the hood from underneath - and the guy in their office (who never even looked at the car) denied warranty service, because it was ""obviously a rock chip""."

bloomington,2r8woh,CornFedCritic,2,Sun Jan 4 00:39:19 2015 UTC,Your BF will need to establish himself with a regular doctor and see that doctor as the doctor requires (typically every 3-6 months). Find a doctor that looks good (IU health has many to choose from) and have him go in for a physical / new patient setup.  They will book an initial 1-hour consultation with the doctor where he will go over past medical issues / conditions / family history / genetics / etc.  They will ask for current medication list and such.  At this visit your BF will need to request a refill on his pain medication.  The doctor will decide if that's okay and issue a prescription.  You don't just go to a doctor to get pain meds.  You establish a providor and they monitor you every few months to see how everything is going and to adjust medication as needed.

It's very common for hunters to get a deer, take it in to get it processed, then fail to pick it up because they don't want to pay for it.  So processing facilities that do business with individual hunters will usually have a surplus of good quality venison, usually at lowish prices (since they're looking to unload it)."

(d) Notwithstanding section 6 of this chapter, deer meat and products from farm raised deer that meet the requirements under IC 15-17 may be sold to the public.     (e) In addition to being liable for the reimbursement required under subsection (a), a person who recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally violates subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) while using or possessing:         (1) a sound suppressor designed for use with or on a firearm, commonly called a silencer; or         (2) a device used as a silencer; commits unlawful hunting while using or possessing a silencer, a Class C misdemeanor."

It can also refer to bear meat, wild boar meat, caribou, elk, moose, etc.  Only meat from a wild goat hunted as game would be called venison.  Goat meat is generally called Chevon or Mutton, though there is a distinction coming from Serrano regional Spanish cuisine sort of like veal to cow, with cabrito being particularly young, tender goat.

A co-op is NOT just about low price. If price is all that matters to you then feel free to get all of your stuff from Walmart, Dollar General, and Kroger. You the know the places that pay their workers crap wages with little to no health insurance, make no effort to be ethical in their business practices, and often treat their employees badly.  We've all seen college age kids that work in retail in Bloomington who who can be a bit rude and moody. Bloomingfoods doesn't have a monopoly on this. I tend to think workers in the U.S. go too far in the direction of ""the customer is always right"" so I don't take it too personally if the occasional retail clerk is a bit curt or unengaged. I would prefer this to clerks at some major retail outlets who have to wear badges that say things like ""I like to help!"" or are told to make sure they smile at customers, or try to engage them in forced conversations.  Products like organic, vegan, or gluten free food cost more and thus more affluent people are always going to be more able to afford such products. The same goes for hybrid or electric cars, solar panels, etc. What is the point about seeing a bunch of Prius cars in the parking lot of Bloomingfoods? That these people are thumbing their noses at those of us who can't afford them? Products that are produced with a more ethical intention are usually going to cost more. Does that mean that people who purchase them are ""thumbing their noses"" at the rest of us? Maybe I should just shop at Walmart from now on so other people won't think I'm being an ""ethical snob"" (/sarcasm).  I know Bloomingfood employees and former employees and there are good reasons why they want to create a union. The general manager of the co-op actively PROFITS from doing business with certain vendors and has WAY too much power in the decision making of co-op. This is unethical to say the least. I've also know of a few behaviors that employees were told to engage in that were straight out of the playbook from places like Wal-mart and don't add to the value of place in any meaningful sense.   Sorry for the rant! I am willing to listen to opinions to the contrary but I just noticed the last three or four threads about Bloomingfoods seemed to me to be a bit one-sided."
bloomington,2qcamb,Cipius,8,Fri Dec 26 15:12:01 2014 UTC,"Onesided   The general manager of the co-op actively PROFITS from doing business with certain vendors and has WAY too much power in the decision making of co-op.

I've also know of a few behaviors that employees were told to engage in that were straight out of the playbook from places like Wal-mart and don't add to the value of place in any meaningful sense.   But you just pointed out one of the sole reasons of the high-pricedness of Bloomingfoods and how co-ops should not work. Organic shouldn't mean higher prices, organic should mean no to low pesticide. Have you actually looked at the markup for some of these items? 300-500% at times, and people justify it to themselves because it's organic and apparently organic is synonymous with expensive. There are times where I will walk into Bloomingfoods and walk out because I can get 15 items over a dollar cheaper at Kroger - for the exact same brands."
bloomington,2qcamb,hamfriend,0,Thu Dec 25 16:56:35 2014 UTC,"My understanding is that it comes down to supply chain and stock space.  Kroger has a big supply chain and orders a huge amount of product, so it is able to negotiate lower prices per unit and sell at a lower retail price.  Kroger also has a lot more shelf space, and can absorb certain kinds of losses (like in-store rotisserie chickens, which are usually sold in supermarkets for less than cost) in their general sales.  Smaller operations cannot do that.  So why would you shop at a smaller local place that is more expensive?  Well, one reason is that much more of your dollar that you spend in Bloomington stays in Bloomington.  It doesn't pad a corporate coffer somewhere outside the local economy.  Not that I have a problem with supply chain commerce- I shop pretty much everywhere, both for quality and price.  But when I can, I do like to try to support a viable local economy."

While I prefer to spend my money at local businesses, for me the occasional trip to Bloomingfoods is only about freshness or the availability of a particular obscure ingredient.  By the by, I would be careful at Sahara Mart.  I worked there for a spell, and label scraping isn't an unheard of practice.  They've got a lot of awesome stuff.  Just scrutinize it before you buy it to make sure that it's fresh."

bloomington,2qcamb,hamfriend,-1,Fri Dec 26 07:16:36 2014 UTC,"I would say the most concerning thing about Bloomingfoods is the number of Priuses in any of the stores' lots at any given time, and then when I get out of my own to go in I feel existentially confused...  Like any store, it has its own culture and you have to know how to shop to it. As a townie, the upsetting thing to me about our co-op is that it started more as a genuine, literal co-op, but now it is a bit of a status symbol (hence the Priuses--which I really don't get how they're an Apple of cars). It's even gotten to the point where it's trending with the IU sororities.  By and large though, I've found the staff and most of the other customers to at least be pleasant, with the natural exception here and there. I think a lot of their deli stuff is a good deal considering the selection and quality of source ingredients, but I'm also vegan and try to stay gluten-free, so that's a pretty limiting factor in decent grab-and-go options elsewhere. A very limited portion of their produce is worth it too, though the concept of $3/lb organic cauliflower (or however much it is; it might actually be more) never ceases to be enraging to me."

bloomington,2qcamb,amantooth,3,Thu Dec 25 06:45:10 2014 UTC,"This is a good point. I don't know why you're being downvoted. To expect any local business to be able to compete (price-wise) with the purchasing power of corporate titans is a pretty tall order. The main objective of a business (yes even a co-op) is to make a profit. A co-op does not mean that things are sold at cost. A co-op is a business where members buy shares of the business to own a piece of it. In return for this, they get discounts and a check at the end of the year which is a percentage of what they spent.   Bloomingfoods does charge a premium for a lot of products, but that enables them to create an atmosphere that they believe enhances Bloomington. They contribute to numerous causes in Bloomington, support events, stock products from local businesses, and provide a venue for artistic expression from time to time. Their produce and goods that are due to expire that day are donated to Mother Hubbards Cupboard and Hoosier Hills, and are given away for free to those who need it. If you don't want to pay the prices, don't shop there. We have an amazing Kroger, and more organic stores are on the way.   For those discussing prices. Let's take a moment to understand the farmers market vs Bloomingfoods vs Kroger. The farmers market is cheaper than Bloomingfoods because you are buying a product directly from the vendor. Even then, it's only a little cheaper. There is no building cost, no utilities, and there are no other employees other than the family sitting there. Bloomingfoods takes on the most cost. There are 4 Bloomingfoods stores. That's not bad, but they can't sell the bulk they would need to get the lowest prices.   Kroger buys things on a massive scale. It costs them next to nothing to purchase things, because they can buy vast amounts of it. They come and offer you 50k for your 500,000 apples. You're like okay. That's 10 cents an apple. Not bad. But if I sold it all on my own at 50 cents an apple, that'd be 250k.  Let's face it. They know you can't sell 500,000 apples individually. Bloomingfoods doesn't have that to offer, they can't buy all 500,000 of those apples, they're stuck paying like 25 cents an apple, (2.5x Krogers cost) with all of Krogers overhead costs, and none of their bulk buying power, because they don't have 500 stores.   This isn't relating at all to any personal experiences regarding staff or customers, just a breakdown of why it costs more at Bloomingfoods.  FWIW i've had great experiences with knowledgable staff at bfoods. Personally I kinda expect some customers at Bloomingfoods to be a little stuck up, but that's what you get for having an aging hippie liberal academic population concerned with their own issues. I think some people ITT are forgetting what Bloomington is. I'm sure the same is true in Ann Arbor, or Madison or wherever large liberal arts schools be found. Also, generalizations never really help anything, there are assholes everywhere!"
bloomington,2qcamb,hamfriend,-1,Thu Dec 25 06:45:26 2014 UTC,"While we're on the topic, let's talk customer service, too. I've had several fairly shitty experiences in Bloomingfoods, but only one experience where I had an employee answer real questions and point me in the right direction.  I just really don't get why it's so damned important to buy from that place when you can go elsewhere for cheaper and actually get help from a clerk that doesn't have to sigh, put down their iphone, and help you."

It sells that lifestyle, all of the somewhat hypocritical ""ethical"" posturing that goes with it.  I've found the service to be pretty good, at least at the east side location, and I'm a dude who puts grocery staff through their paces with obscure ingredients, custom cuts of meat, other odd requests.  My go-to questions for people who feel that some standard of service isn't being met are:  1.) How much would someone have to pay you, working close to minimum wage as a cashier or grocery stocker, to provide great customer service?  2.) How much extra are you willing to pay for the service?"
bloomington,2qcamb,whiskey_and_wine,2,Thu Jan 1 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"My real issue is that I can't imagine people at Kroger make that much more, and yet, I can find people at one of the city's several Krogers in a matter of seconds to answer a question. Not that I'm the type to really require special consideration, normally.  I just find that at Bloomingfoods, although their selection can be really good, that the employees I've dealt with seem bothered when I ask them very simple things: ""Do you also carry x?"""
bloomington,2qcamb,hoosierhipster,0,Thu Dec 25 05:58:23 2014 UTC,"Huh.  Yeah, I shop there for very specific items under very narrow circumstances- mostly if I want to get something that's in season but I missed the farmer's market, or if I want some rarer or higher quality produce item, like multicolored carrots or asparagus.  I buy my preferred coffee, Brown Ct. Coffee Co., when I miss the market, and I buy bean sprouts there on a daily basis when I make pho (because the bean sprouts need to be fresh as possible).  On that note, I once made a big batch of pho, went in to Bloomingfoods looking for sprouts.  They were out, so the stocker walked me over to the office and personally called the other Bloomingfood locations to see where they might still have sprouts.  They had some fresh over at the 2nd street location, and we had pho with an appropriate level of crunch that night.  All of which is an anecdotal experience, but we're both talking about anecdotal experiences here.  My feeling is that, in general, unless service is part of the experience that I'm paying for (like a good haircut or a restaurant meal), great service from an employee whose compensation does not incentivize or include a customer relations function is something I can't fairly expect, only be pleasantly surprised by.  If I'm not paying for it, I set my expectation bar low.  And that way I'm pretty much always happy."

Kroger pays minimum wage IIRC. But anytime I've had a question they've answered it or said ""I don't know, I'll ask"" and found someone who did. So I would expect at least that level of service from someone making more, not a shrug or an eye roll."

bloomington,2p9isf,TheVodkaDrink,3,Sun Dec 14 21:31:47 2014 UTC,The plus doesn't apply to the Q(ueer). It's just so we don't end up going through the entire alphabet soup of alternative sexuality/genders because it's tiresome. Personally I just say Gender and Sexual Minorities (GSM) as a catch-all.
bloomington,2p9isf,rhorama,3,Mon Dec 15 00:47:25 2014 UTC,queer isn't gay? i'm not trying to be a dick. just thought it was the same thing
bloomington,2p9isf,TheVodkaDrink,5,Mon Dec 15 03:58:37 2014 UTC,"I'm queer.  I was born into a female body and I get the most sexual pleasure from male bodies - so that would make me heterosexual.  Inside, though, I don't feel female. ""So, your trans then?"" No, because I don't feel male either. For a large portion of my life, I've just stuck with androgyny- Neither being overtly feminine or masculine. I don't usually wear ladies fashions, I rarely remove my body hair, sometimes I shave my head, LOVE men's shoes... But I also really like makeup and collect Barbie dolls. I can't stick with the conventions of my born gender role but I also don't feel comfortable in that of the other.  Now, queer has become kind of the catch-all term for people like me who are just non-conforming to any of the other letters of the alphabet so my experience isn't all that is meant by ""queer"". Some people are asexual. Some would look at me in a female body without a breast bind and say I'm not queer. Others may be struggling with a trans identity.  I'm really more body queer than I am gender queer. I wake up every morning feeling like a newborn giraffe. What the hell are these things jutting out from me? Oh yeah, legs... I have legs. Ugh, what is this feeling inside me? Oh yeah, hunger... Humans get hungry. WHAT IS ALL THIS BLOOD COMING OUT OF ME!??!?! Oh yeah, period... I've had one of these for nearly 20 years.   Sound odd? It is odd. That's why it's called queer."

bloomington,2p9isf,rhorama,2,Mon Dec 15 04:20:34 2014 UTC,"If I recall, queer is more of a catchall term for the spectrum of sexual identity whereas gay/lesbian are more specific regions on that spectrum."

bloomington,2p9isf,nhmo,1 point,Tue Dec 16 15:23:59 2014 UTC,"Queer theory:       Queer theory is a field of post-structuralist critical theory that emerged in the early 1990s out of the fields of queer studies and women's studies. Queer theory includes both queer readings of texts and the theorisation of 'queerness' itself. Heavily influenced by the work of Lauren Berlant, Leo Bersani, Judith Butler, Lee Edelman, Jack Halberstam,  David Halperin, José Esteban Muñoz, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, queer theory builds both upon feminist challenges to the idea that gender is part of the essential self and upon gay/lesbian studies' close examination of the socially constructed nature of sexual acts and identities. Whereas gay/lesbian studies focused its inquiries into natural and unnatural behaviour with respect to homosexual behaviour, queer theory expands its focus to encompass any kind of sexual activity or identity that falls into normative and deviant categories. Italian feminist and film theorist Teresa de Lauretis coined the term ""queer theory"" for a conference she organized at the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1990 and a special issue of Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies she edited based on that conference.

I've never had a problem with biking on the sidewalks and paths - didn't know it wasn't allowed. What do you mean enforced?  Maybe you're right but I don't think you would have a problem as long as you're considerate of others (walking or biking). Just don't try to zoom around people too fast.  Also it may be a rule that you should have a bike permit, but most people don't and I think they do not check. Just don't chain your bike to a stair railing/light post/other place that's not for bikes, that's when they might give you a warning."

bloomington,2p52fj,Elaine_Benes_,7,Sun Dec 14 07:38:21 2014 UTC,"I bike on the paths on campus and so do lots of other people, just be conscientious and very aware of your surroundings. Take it slow (as in, match walking speed) when it's really crowded between classes. Give pedestrians plenty of room and maybe get a bell. When you bike in the streets on campus, watch for pedestrians stepping right in front of you without looking both ways.  I would be more worried about biking off campus. I consider myself a pretty seasoned cyclist (I don't have a car, so I've been biking to work year round for years), and I have near misses in Bloomington more than I would like. Other drivers don't see you, especially at lights, or don't treat you like another car. I used to live in Minneapolis and I felt much safer on my bike there. So as much as you can, I would stick to one-way streets and ones with bike lanes. Expect Indiana drivers to do crazy things like try to pass you on the left while you are signaling to turn left. I don't mean to scare you and you shouldn't be too worried about getting hit, but it's a good idea to assume the worst from drivers near you. (Especially after the bars open...)

In any case, it's good to have your bike on record with them in case it should be stolen.  In general, do not ride on sidewalks. Multi-use paths (≥ 8 feet wide) are okay.

You can visualize this by going to Google Maps and ""getting directions"" to somewhere on campus, clicking the bike option, and clicking ""show bike paths"". The green paths are considered bike-friendly.  I will say that although campus paths are meant to be shared, it's sometimes impossible to ride through the crowds during busy times of day. I commute to and from campus and I park my bike in a rack near 3rd street then walk around where I need to go the rest of the day."

It certainly wasn't just me or an isolated experience.  Honestly we all thought it was intentional, since I worked in the industry and know you don't accidentally hire and retain a whole staff of surly waitstaff. It's a little alarming it wasn't supposed to be part of the atmosphere.   I'm not certain you could speak to their waiting attitude when having them separated from the job to give you a tour. I have no doubt they were nice people, just surly and inattentive waitstaff."
bloomington,2nwgfs,hamfriend,-5,Mon Dec 1 15:08:58 2014 UTC,"That sounds like the exact opposite of my experience for the 14 years that I've been a regular customer there.  I hate to say it, but maybe the problem is you?  I've worked a lot of industry jobs myself, mostly in the kitchen but a couple front of house, and I carry with me into those exchanges what a shitty job it is.  So I go into encounters with a smile and a good attitude, and what I get is great service almost everywhere I go.  I think, referencing some of your other comments, if you go into the encounter with the attitude that it is an entirely mercenary exchange, that the only reason you get good service is because the waitstaff wants your dollar, and your service is only as good as the depth of that want, then you'll probably get something that feels like a mercenary exchange; this might come across as surly.    It's a strip club attitude.  And it seems like it would get in the way of enjoying a meal more than perceived surliness on the part of waitstaff, who honestly aren't paid enough for the crap that most customers expect of them."
bloomington,2nwgfs,StalinsLastStand,5,Mon Dec 1 16:16:48 2014 UTC,"That's weird because it didn't happen at any other Bloomington establishment and so far at least one other person in this thread has said they always experienced the same thing. Plus the issue that it was a sentiment shared by every single person I knew who'd been there, including regulars.   But you're right, the problem was probably me and my attitude.   And like I said, I also worked in the industry. So it's not like I don't know how to be friendly to complete strangers."
bloomington,2nwgfs,hamfriend,-10,Mon Dec 1 17:19:29 2014 UTC,"Being as you sort of come across here as a judgmental dick, yeah, your attitude being the problem is more persuasive than uncorroborated anecdotal hearsay and a single somewhat misogynist concurrence.  Sorry, guy."

bloomington,2nwgfs,StalinsLastStand,0,Mon Dec 1 14:55:33 2014 UTC,"I live on the west coast. Many establishments pay full state minimum wage plus tips instead of a tipped minimum wage plus tips. This leads to changes in service compared to the east coast (where I've also lived and worked waiting jobs and can make accurate comparisons) or Midwest. Fewer waitstaff are hired because they are more expensive. That plus not being so beholden to tips leads to a less attentive and less forced-friendly waitstaff.  Runcible Spoon in the years I went there, had a very similar wait atmosphere to what I personally experience on the west coast. I'm sorry if you find that offensive."

We've been looking for a good excuse to go to 3 Floyds.  Depending on what your timeline is, I can grab an extra six-pack.  Word to the wise on Saharamart- their selection is good, but you've got to approach that place like you would a market in any other part of the world- sometimes you'll get stuff that is fantastically fresh at a good value, sometimes they scrape the expiration date/mold off of old goods.  Their deals on alcohol are really good, and their variety is fantastic, but I'm always wary, especially of the stuff they keep in that room with all the windows.  All that light denatures alcohol, tinted bottle or no."

I named her Suzanne, after the Leonard Cohen song.  I agree that most of the deals are bullshit.

Exciting things are happening all the time, and I hope one day to come back. For now, I am ready to see what the rest of the world has to offer me, but Bloomington will forever be my home and I cannot afford to forget where I came from and what it has done to shape who I am.  On a related note, I would like to get a tattoo before I leave. I'm thinking design #3 here, which is just a quick-and-dirty mockup of what I want. I'd obviously love for an artist to clean it up and make it look good.  What it symbolizes is the ultimate frisbee team around here, Nantucket Sleighride. I've grown as a human and a player with that team, and the tattoo represents the gifts Bloomington has given me.  If anyone has any recommendations for a good local tattoo artist, I'd love to hear them."

bloomington,2mx78c,spacecostanza,6,Thu Nov 20 22:34:26 2014 UTC,"near west side is super close to downtown, and i don't think any students really live over there.  essentially it's the neighborhood north and west of kirkwood and rogers.  ten minute walk to downtown.  bryan park is just south of campus, southeast of downtown.  fifteen to twenty minute walk to downtown depending on what side of the park you're at.  i lived here for a year and it was great.  both of these areas probably easily fall into your price range.  the student population, if there is any, is not going to be a party-type crowd, for they are both nice and quiet areas.  both are very pretty with lots of trees and older homes.  and both are definitely bike-friendly, as is much of bloomington.  you will have to do some digging to find a place at this part of the year since the whole city is structured on the academic year.  therefore, most leases end in july or august, but subleases that can be resigned are always an option.  just spend a week searching through the usual mediums and you'll find something."

bloomington,2mx78c,kittenbutter,2,Thu Nov 20 23:09:10 2014 UTC,"If you are commuting to Crane every morning, traffic will be much easier coming from the Near West Side."
bloomington,2mx78c,kittenbutter,2,Thu Nov 20 23:42:25 2014 UTC,"Really? Is that because its easier to get to 37 from there? I just looked at a place that says its on the B-line about 3 miles northwest of the square. It's near Hearthstone Health Campus. Not exactly walkable but not too bad. Also, I don't recall the B-line going that way but I probably didn't ride the whole length. Does it go that far out from town?"
bloomington,2mx78c,kittenbutter,3,Fri Nov 21 00:14:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, to get to Crane you'll actually take 45 instead of 37.  From the Near West Side it's easier to by-pass downtown traffic and cut over to 2nd st (Turns in to Bloomfield Rd which turns into 45).  There is a lot of annoying traffic around Walnut and 2nd pretty much always.  If you looked at a place near the Heartstone Health Campus, that is really far away from downtown and you can do better.  Sheesh.  Being able to walk to most things is the best part of living in Bloomington.  The B-Line is pretty long and turns into a different trail after a while.  B-Line Map"

Many of the landlords just post signs in their yard instead of Craigslist.  Most property management places are total jerks.  Don't expect your deposit back from them, and they have a total captive audience here because of the students.  It's probably a better idea to secure a sublet or short lease right now and then find something for next fall in the spring.  Oh yeah, people start searching for a new place around February & March.

If you can, shoot for McDoel Gardens, which is roughly centered on Dodds St., which diverges off of Walnut just south of Wylie.  It's a nice neighborhood, well within walking distance, a couple blocks south of the hospital, within walking distance of the Kroger there.  They have a pretty active and friendly neighborhood association, do cohesive neighborhood type stuff like block parties.  The mid-south side is pretty nice, too.  There's some development going on at Henderson and Hillside that should provide a lot of pretty nice living options.  This is my neighborhood, and it's been my favorite area to live in, maybe tied with the near west side."

bloomington,2mva8h,BigCheezeIN,6,Thu Nov 20 11:43:13 2014 UTC,"Maybe you meant to say they are stifling competition by limiting the number of vendors, not protecting it.   To play the devil's advocate, and because my phone won't open the links or DL the pdfs right now, they must have a logical benefit cited to propose these changes. You seem biased since you are apparently from big cheese. Just curious what their angle is."
bloomington,2mva8h,backfromsolaris,4,Thu Nov 20 13:53:49 2014 UTC,"From the first page of the proposed ordinance (there's more, but I'm cutting out excerpts that seem relevant to your question):   Whereas, the Mayor and Common Council are concerned for the health, safety, peace and welfare of the citizens of the City of Bloomington; and   Whereas, the primary purpose of the public streets and sidewalks is the use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic; and  Whereas, the number of persons using the public streets and sidewalks in the City of Bloomington in recent years has increased dramatically due to an expanded commercial use and a growing tourism industry and has resulted in an increase in congestion on these streets and sidewalks; and   Whereas, in order to protect the unique character of the City of Bloomington, the City finds it necessary to regulate solicitors, pushcarts, and mobile vendor units inside of the City’s jurisdictional limits; and  Whereas, one of the primary purposes of this Ordinance is to promote the public interest by enhancing the attractiveness of the City and by providing opportunities for creative, colorful and pedestrian-focused commercial activities."
bloomington,2mva8h,Destroyer23,10,Thu Nov 20 14:26:56 2014 UTC,So basically they want to prevent the sidewalks from becoming a complete cluster fuck of lines for food trucks.
bloomington,2mva8h,derprondo,8,Thu Nov 20 15:22:31 2014 UTC,"Sort of. There also seems to be the issue of mobile food carts (the ones that have to park on the street, not the pushcarts) making too much noise with their generators, and parking too close to other restaurants (they have to be at least 50 feet away from the nearest restaurant entryway). There was also some discussion as to what they want the overall atmosphere of downtown to be, and don't like the idea of there being food trucks parked everywhere."
bloomington,2mva8h,DREWHOUSER,5,Thu Nov 20 15:51:47 2014 UTC,i can sympathize with the noise aspect.  it does sort of spoil walking down kirkwood on a nice day when the big cheeze's generator makes you feel like you're at the county fair
bloomington,2mva8h,backfromsolaris,2,Thu Nov 20 20:35:00 2014 UTC,That was the first upgrade we made when we could afford it which was back in the summer of 2012. Generators are very expensive so when you are first making the business plan it is a common idea to purchase a more affordable generator to start off. The problem we learned with that is that the cheaper ones are usually A LOT louder. We upgraded to a Honda which is manufactured at about 60 decibels. I'm pretty sure its one of the quietest on the market. For reference and a normal conversation between two people runs about 60-70 decibels. However there are some new trucks that just started and their generators are very loud. I can only imagine they had the same idea we had when starting up. I agree that there should be a regulation on how loud the generators should be that are on the food trucks. No one wants to hear that while they are enjoying a walk on Kirkwood or eating outside.
bloomington,2mva8h,ulsanforyou,1 point,Fri Nov 21 11:24:36 2014 UTC,"You know, there are enough abandoned properties in the city that could be converted into parking lots. Seems like it'd be a good idea to have a special area where food trucks could park and not congest traffic, etc."
bloomington,2mva8h,ulsanforyou,3,Thu Nov 20 20:52:52 2014 UTC,That is something that i think would be a win for everyone. We have been working with the city about finding a spot to do that so hopefully that is a practical future idea.
bloomington,2mva8h,Dieselfred,3,Fri Nov 21 12:18:17 2014 UTC,For some reason it seems that the huge open lot behind Napa Auto Parts would be perfect.
bloomington,2mva8h,ulsanforyou,2,Fri Nov 21 14:15:46 2014 UTC,That lot is a joke. It was supposed to be permit parking only and the convention center handed out/sold permits but never enforced it.  The convention center owns a lot of the area including Napa's building and some of the other buildings.    The only people I have seen the convention center make move are employees of the surrounding businesses who have permits to park there. The bad thing about having food trucks there would be people parking in spots that are meant for customers of Napa and/or Napa's delivery truck parking spots. It happens now whenever there's an event at the convention center.

Then I thought that if they were all always in the same spot, wouldn't that kind of defeat the purpose of a food TRUCK?  I don't know anything about owning a food truck, but I imagine the mobility is kind of a big deal.  Could still be neat though..."
bloomington,2mva8h,backfromsolaris,2,Fri Nov 21 02:05:45 2014 UTC,"Having a set location would be great because it would some consistently to us and to our customers on where to find us. Having a fixed parking lot wouldn't mean that we couldn't move. It would just mean that if we didn't have a special location set up for that day, we could rely on always having a backup spot to open. Right now we not only have to make plans if we want to park is a special spot but we also have to make plans for our backup plan because after we close in the special spot we have to make sure we have our second location locked down. Otherwise we are stuck sitting around and waiting for specific spots to open up. That could take minutes or hours. Trying to plan a schedule with employees around that kind of uncertainty will drive me insane."
bloomington,2mva8h,backfromsolaris,1 point,Fri Nov 21 12:23:58 2014 UTC,"Well, maybe an outdoor food court would actually be a better idea. I don't know."
bloomington,2mva8h,hamfriend,1 point,Fri Nov 21 02:21:38 2014 UTC,"The overall atmosphere of downtown i think is what they are trying to protect the most and i can understand that. Being worried about food trucks being parked everywhere tho is a comment that we have often heard from city officials and i feel that kind of comment ignores the nature of how businesses compete. The fact is Bloomington isn't a big enough town to have a large amount of food trucks. City regulators don't need to make that decision for the public. The public will decide by where they spend their money. The idea of food trucks being everywhere i feel is unpractical because theres not enough of a market for that many trucks to survive. If that turns out to not be the case and food trucks line the streets and all survive and start change the look of downtown then that is when you go in a change regulations. However, making a new ordinance that implies that they know what they are protecting us from is bogus in this sense. If food trucks were going to line the streets everywhere that would've already happened by now because there are basically no regulations in place against that right now. The fact that you don't see that just proves its a non-issue because the market isn't big enough for that scenario to happen."
bloomington,2mva8h,TheVodkaDrink,3,Fri Nov 21 12:07:58 2014 UTC,"well, i can definitely understand where they are coming from.  bloomington is not a huge city.  i'm talking physical space, not population.  if it did have more space, there would be numerous blocks available to have food carts where there is still ample foot traffic to provide them opportunity for business.  however, bloomington has already sprouted lots of businesses along basically all high foot traffic areas, so it is a bit much to have food trucks around.  i absolutely love food truck culture and would even love to open my own one day, but they really do belong in a larger city.  food carts are another story.  i feel they are capable of comfortably fitting in more areas in this city, like that guy with the hot dogs near samira, or the burrito guy in front of the atlas bar."
bloomington,2mva8h,Destroyer23,1 point,Thu Nov 20 20:31:13 2014 UTC,"Stifling competition is probably a better term however it was stated at the city council meeting the other day by a couple council members that they do ""have a responsibility to protect"" certain businesses that they believe make downtown Bloomington unique. I am one of the owners of the Big Cheeze but i can honestly say that in all of my conversations with city officials, i have done my best to be as unbiased as possible. I have spent my entire life in Bloomington so personally my angle has consistently been what i think is best for downtown Bloomington. It can now be viewed as a bias opinion because i did something about my angle and started a business in the virtually untapped industry that i thought could benefit downtown Bloomington. At the time we started there were no food trucks. I think what we have proven is that people want food trucks to be a part of this towns culture. I am all for finding a happy median but i believe what this new ordinance will do is keep new food trucks from starting up in Bloomington. From an owner of the Big Cheeze's perspective that means more barriers of entry and actually a little protection from competition for ourselves, but like i said i am trying to be as unbiased as possible and fight for what i think would benefit downtown Bloomington the most. A thriving food truck community thats focal point is around Peoples Park i think is something that would add a lot of value to this town."

EDIT: Here is the HT's list:  DEMOCRATS  Rick Dietz — Despite just winning re-election to Monroe County Council, Dietz said he’s considering a mayoral race.  John Whikehart — As Kruzan’s no. 2 in city administration, moving up to mayor is the next logical step.  Darryl Neher — Serving his first term on the Bloomington City Council and is current president of the body. Kruzan hinted that his pick is someone he’s disagreed with before but believes would do a good job, and Neher and Kruzan have that history.  John Hamilton — Ran in the Democratic primary in 2011 against Kruzan and said Tuesday he hasn’t thought about it yet.  Susan Sandberg — Joined the council in 2006 after Chris Gaal was elected prosecutor. Current vice chair for the Democratic Party.  Shelli Yoder — Also was just re-elected to the county council, but has also been known to go for other offices like when she ran for the 9th Congressional District.  Matt Pierce — Replaced Kruzan in the state legislature, but said being mayor isn’t on his bucket list.  REPUBLICANS  Paul White — Lost a bid for a county council seat in the May primary, and ran in the general election for Perry Township board. Has said he’ll be running again in the future.  Brian Ellison — Also lost in the general election for county council but is well-liked by party leadership and we could see him trying for local office again.  Jeff Ellington — Currently a city firefighter and most recently served as Monroe County Recorder after Jim Fielder died. Lost re-election to Eric Schmitz, but has tried for a number of offices at the county and state levels in the past.  Pat Jeffries — Former Monroe County Treasurer and has put her name on the ballot several times in the past 10 years, including for auditor, county commissioner and Perry Township board. Could toss her name in the mix for mayor.  Sue West — Former city controller that left the city earlier this year. Has served on the county council, and is well-liked by many local politicians from both parties.  Jason Banach — Doubtful about how likely this is given his position as director of real estate for Indiana University, but he has been successful in city politics.  Jacob Franklin — Already works in city government and most recently ran for county clerk, but lost to incumbent Linda Robbins.  David Sabbagh — Last Republican to challenge Kruzan, but said Tuesday he doesn’t plan to run again."
bloomington,2mpyom,Corsaer,8,Wed Nov 19 00:30:55 2014 UTC,"Butcher's Block carries sashimi grade tuna, flash frozen and flown in.  They also usually carry sashimi grade salmon, arctic char, scallops and roe.  Much of the salmon you'll find in local Krogers is also virtually sashimi grade, if it comes from the aquaculture up just past Martinsville, which most of the farm-raised salmon does.  It doesn't have the sorts of parasites or other stuff you get in wild caught, though the flavor is not quite as distinct with a good wild caught, there are more versatile things you can do with it on the raw end of the scale.  I use it for my homemade lox."

Which is weird, since all the times I've been there since and had questions the employees have been pretty knowledgeable or went to the back and got someone else to answer my question. I will try there again! Thanks!"
bloomington,2mpyom,sharkinwolvesclothin,11,Wed Nov 19 01:34:03 2014 UTC,"Sushi (and sashimi) grade is a marketing term - maybe that's why he was apprehensive, if they haven't defined it for themselves. You will need to ask about parasitic destruction guarantee if you want regulatory backing."
bloomington,2mpyom,JogaMimFora,3,Wed Nov 19 02:46:48 2014 UTC,"Needs upvote. It's like saying ""It's all natural."""
bloomington,2mpyom,hamfriend,5,Wed Nov 19 16:09:13 2014 UTC,"Not everybody there is a fish guy.  They're a little more adept on how to break down bigger critters, and sushi might be a foreign concept to some of the older school guys who supply the more conventional knowhow.  Anyway, I've been getting my sashimi from them for probably 5 years or so.  Always very pleased with the results.  It is certainly very expensive, but a very little goes a very long way.  If you have the extra scrilla, I recommend buying a little extra tuna- season it, coat it in sesame seeds, then pan sear it, leaving it rare towards the middle.  It's the base for my favorite salad, which benefits from some Asian flavors in the dressing and extra toasted sesame seeds for crunch.  Interesting side-note; Butcher's Block supplies No Coast Reserve, and it's actually a tandem project with chef Elgar, who was the guy who totally turned Upland's menu and kitchen around when he was exec chef there for a couple years running.  They do a lot of raw, some with the seafood the Butcher's Block brings in."
bloomington,2mpyom,hamfriend,2,Wed Nov 19 02:28:36 2014 UTC,Thanks for the extra information and the suggestions! I've always liked sushi but never ate it a whole lot. Recently listened to a Stuff You Should Know episode on it and it made me want to try and make some myself again. I figured I should ask around here first before driving around to different places like last time.
bloomington,2mpyom,Jonukas,1 point,Wed Nov 19 03:15:32 2014 UTC,"One recommendation I might make to make it a little cheaper to experiment with is doing salt-cured lox out of much cheaper kroger salmon, and then building philadelphia rolls out of that- if you're looking to get your technique and rice prep down to perfect before you tackle more expensive roll contents.  Philly rolls are lox/smoked salmon, cream cheese (I use marscapone, since straight cream cheese can get too salty with soy and the salmon) and par-cooked asparagus."
bloomington,2molmj,THEM4CHIN3,6,Tue Nov 18 17:46:18 2014 UTC,I think most of the programs that do that reserve it for folks who are income-eligible for SNAP or other similar programs.
bloomington,2molmj,hamfriend,-3,Tue Nov 18 18:24:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I imagine there is an income contingent. I'm confident myself and my roommates qualify"
bloomington,2molmj,hamfriend,8,Tue Nov 18 19:39:35 2014 UTC,"Not to be callous, but those resources might be better reserved for the families who are in deeper and more chronic need.  Generally SNAP benefits for college students who receive federal aid are reserved for students who work or engage in a state or federal or state work-study program, or students with children.  I understand that living on loans is tight.  I'm living on loans, myself, along with a couple of modest investments I made prior to going back to school.  But speaking generally, poverty-relief programs are not really designed for college students.  If you can afford a $16 turkey from Kroger, a $3 bag of potatoes, $4 worth of challah bread, a few bucks for auxiliaries like carrots, celery, spices, etc. then you can make a pretty nice Thanksgiving dinner for three people, and probably should leave the free dinners to the people who can't afford even that."
bloomington,2molmj,hamfriend,-7,Tue Nov 18 23:22:10 2014 UTC,"I understand what you're saying and I completely agree that families in need should absolutely come first, and they should especially come before myself and my roommates. However the list of food and prices you wrote is still more then we can afford. We can only afford free unfortunately.   None of us qualify for food stamps/snap benefits because we're all enrolled in college full time and do not work 20 hours a week as per the requirements. If I could juggle 20 hours a week and a full time college schedule with my ADD that'd be great but it's not in the cards.   Regardless thank you for your reply, it's appreciated."
bloomington,2molmj,whiskey_and_wine,5,Tue Nov 18 23:32:51 2014 UTC,"Not to be nosy, and feel free to tell me to back off, but how is your food budgeted currently?  $30 for an occasion meal for three people seems in line with modest food budgeting.  I work in low-income legal services while I finish law school, and that's the area in which I intend to work following graduation, so being in touch with the budgeting decisions and food security of folks who are a potentially large part of our client base is something I'm interested in.  Plus, I have a culinary background and used to work in a lot of kitchens- so I might be able to pass along recipes for nutritious meals that run about $20 for a week's worth of sustenance."

If you've never read ""The Gift of Fear"" or ""Protecting the Gift"" by Gavin de Becker, go read them now. They are the best books on avoiding violent crime that exist.   I've had dudes flip out and threaten me in my own home, and I've had someone attempt to invade my home. In those cases, what served me far better than a weapon were 1. training in de-escalation and 2. rigorous door-locking protocol, and beefed-up home security-- as in, meaningful window locks (the ones on apartments in this town are so worthless, they ought to be illegal), good door jambs, extra patio-door locks, and deadbolts."

I think it's probably the single best way to prevent violence right after being highly aware of your surroundings, not taking risks and making sure your home is secure.

My experience is that most gun owners downplay the risks that owning a firearm poses to them, and many of them downplay the risks their firearm poses to small children living in or visiting their homes. And sadly, everyone discounts the idea that their routine arguments could, with the addition of a firearm, escalate to deadly force, although this happens all over the country, all the time.

My friend and his wife are die-hard NFL fans and they decided to get rid of their cable subscription at the end of the summer, but they couldn't stand missing games, so they ended up going out for drinks for a few hours each Sunday night (and some Monday nights).  He told me they were spending about $30-40 per night on drinks and appetizers while they were there, which comes out to around $120-160 per month (assuming they go once per week).  Their old cable and internet bill was only $120 per month.  Granted, when you go out for the games, you get food, drinks, and atmosphere.  But, with the cable/internet they were also getting a lot more than just football games.  With that said, if you're looking to only watch a game here and there and drinking a beer or two, you'll probably find it cheaper to cut out cable as long as you don't care about other shows.

bloomington,2lsltr,blah3div4,6,Sun Nov 9 22:03:38 2014 UTC,This joke is a little mean.
bloomington,2lsltr,hamfriend,9,Sun Nov 9 22:17:30 2014 UTC,"As a homeless person who knows all about Seminary Park, I have to say, that it was actually pretty spot on."
bloomington,2lsltr,tsparks1307,6,Sun Nov 9 23:06:14 2014 UTC,I think it drives home the point that the 'cheapest' places to live in Bloomington aren't necessarily worth it.
bloomington,2lsltr,eobanb,3,Mon Nov 10 01:04:01 2014 UTC,"I can read it from that angle.  A lot of the seminary and shalom folks are clients of my office, and so I'm used to a degree of disdain and hostility from the rest of the community towards those folks.  My reading, that it was a joke at the expense of those homeless people, is best understood in that context."
bloomington,2lsltr,hamfriend,2,Mon Nov 10 05:16:02 2014 UTC,"As a client of Shalom, I'm rather curious as to which agency you work for. Like I said, I'm a homeless person, and I've been homeless in B-Town since 2005. It's my opinion, in that context, that a lot of the homeless have rightfully earned their disdain. I was riding my bike down the B-Line near Seminary Kroger and saw a homeless guy shitting in the bushes right off the B-Line. I also see a lot of them chewing out volunteers for no good reason. Most of them are entitled assholes."
bloomington,2lsltr,tsparks1307,3,Mon Nov 10 22:24:02 2014 UTC,"Some information saved for PM.  In general, I don't think that the inference that a particular characteristic pertains to an entire group, and that membership in that group is evidence suggesting that characteristic in an individual, is a valid one.  In my experience, it's difficult to separate out people with mental illness issues from people who are just jerks.  And I'm given to wonder if propensity to act like an animal might have a chicken and egg relationship with the fact that we tend to treat the indigent like animals."
bloomington,2lsltr,hamfriend,7,Tue Nov 11 03:33:32 2014 UTC,"http://www.orchardglencooperative.com/ Orchard Glen may be the cheapest I've ever heard of.  Pros: Cheap for the amount of space you can get - 2BR/1.5 BA, with a little front yard and back yard, space for washer and dryer. Not sure of prices but I heard like $400-$500 for that. May be adjusted based on your income.  Cons: I haven't lived there but I read online complaints of the people who manage it/working there being rude and intimidating poor foreign women. Cannot confirm or deny that. Heard that there is a waiting list. Can't hurt to look into it.  A few possibly cheapest places as far as bang for your buck may be owned by CS Property Management: http://www.cspropertymanagement.com/  Pros: Have some locations close to downtown which include water, trash, and parking in the price of the rent. Management is decent, doesn't seem to give you much shit (in my own experience).   Cons: There have been bedbug outbreaks in the past. Granted, bedbugs are a problem pretty much anywhere in Bloomington every year and are hard to avoid/control no matter where you live."
bloomington,2lsltr,whiskey_and_wine,5,Mon Nov 10 03:33:03 2014 UTC,"I agree. I've lived in Bloomington since '96, and honestly, Orchard Glen is the best deal in town. I rented from them from 99-2002, and loved every second of living there. It's clean, very quiet, the maintenance crew is fantastic, and they pay for heat. But you can't have pets. Birds are ok, but no cats or dogs.   Edit: just a note on the maintenance crew and office staff. This place used to be a dump, so in order to not let it fall apart again they are pretty strict when it comes to violations of the renters agreement. And their approach is pretty blunt. Your car's plates will have to be current, you can't leave trash sitting out, back porch area must be mowed (they have mowers you can borrow), can't leave windows open in the winter. And you have to allow them to come in once a month (announced) to spray the place for bugs. In the meantime, if something goes wrong with the place, they are on top of it on the same day. I did get annoyed with them a couple of times over the mowing, but other than that, if you keep the outside of your place clean, they won't have any problems with you."
bloomington,2lsltr,Schmoopster,9,Mon Nov 10 03:50:16 2014 UTC,"My advice would be to find a private landlord who only owns a few properties.  The best way to do this is to drive around neighborhoods with rentals, trying to stick to neighborhoods on the south and near west sides of town that have less regular student traffic.  If you're not a student and proximity to the university isn't at a premium, consider looking on the far south side of town, or even on the west side of town across 37.  Your first rental is similar in some ways to your first job.  Your future references and rentals will be based on this tenancy.  This is also an opportunity to start learning all the things you need to know of taking care of your living space- effecting basic repairs, maintenance, otherwise becoming 'handy'.  Private landlords are good for this, because they often do their own work on the houses, and it's very easy to say 'hey, can I lend a hand?' and learn a thing or two about home repair while nurturing a good business relationship with your landlord.  Not only will this make you a better tenant, but it will one day make you a better homeowner."
bloomington,2lsltr,hamfriend,4,Sun Nov 9 22:24:31 2014 UTC,"This can be true, however I found that sometimes a private landlord who only owns a few properties can be the worst. After a rather unfortunate time with such a landlord who turned out to be a money grubber that never came through on property repairs and was mismanaging his properties I went with a larger management company, Virgo properties, and it was night and day. They fixed every issue I ever had in a timely manor, they improved the building I was in as part of a planned development cycle, and they sent me a Christmas card.  Ultimately size doesn't matter, it's the people who are related to the company. I picked Virgo because when I drove past the apartment I ended up rented there were two maintenance men updating the apartment in the summer who were beyond polite, knowledgeable and had worked with the company for thirty years.  My best advice on this issue is to go with good people above all other considerations."
bloomington,2lsltr,MrFordization,2,Mon Nov 10 01:38:16 2014 UTC,"Small-scale private landlords can be bad actors, but generally the probability is lower.  Smaller scale operations are less able to absorb infrequent but high costs of noncompliance- getting hit with HUD fines or a lawsuit (however unlikely in Indiana, not to mention Bloomington).  The really bad ones do tend to go out of business as they sell off assets to pay judgments.  A few do have the resources to absorb those costs, but most of those still work through a property management company- generally, people with a lot of money have day jobs that are more lucrative than what their properties bring in, which is just a side investment.  Property management can yield good experiences, however, the structure is already disadvantageous for a tenant, moreso than with a direct landlord/tenant relationship.  In general, a property management company is like facebook- the tenants/users are not the customer, they are the product.  A property management company's customer is the property owner.  Their ability to fill the house with tenants who pay the rent is the product being sold to the owner.  Generally, part of their job is to serve as a buffer between you and the owner, which creates a serious setback when there is reluctance on the part of the owner to complete repairs.  I'm very glad you had a good experience.  But based on the structure of the relationship and the incentives in play, it is more disadvantageous to rent from a property management company than directly from a landlord.  If things are good, there's no problem either way.  If things go badly (which is often not foreseeable when you're first signing the lease) then you're in a better position dealing directly with the owner than with his agent.  That said, it's never a bad idea to check the litigation history of anybody you rent from, and to ask around about specific owners or companies.  I do a thorough background check on anybody I might rent from."

She was prescribed a while tackle box of opiate pain meds that made her feel worse then the pain alone did. She tried cannabis and it helped her out incredibly. She does everything now where before she was almost recluse in her home. I am fully aware this isn't legal in Indiana but if nothing else works perhaps someone you know could get some cannabis for you.

Both of you have histories of significant neglect and/or abuse as children.  If that is true, you should consider some good trauma therapy (which can be hard to find). Pretty much 100% of people who suffer from chronic pain conditions have a history of trauma when they were young, and the only successful treatment course for remission is psychotherapy."

The Career Development Center website also has (or used to have) local jobs once in a while, both in the university and the community. You can also make a profile for free with Employment Plus and they will call you if they find a job that you can interview for.  One piece of advice: if you're at all able, try to find a job with a skill that will apply to something you'd like to do later on. If you are interested in any kind of work that is in an office or uses computers, being a desk clerk in a dorm/receptionist/library will be better for your experience than delivery/food service."

I totally agree that they should have put signs up ahead of time and been more careful, I just wanted to make sure no one thought it was malicious or anything because the color run is super fun and they work really hard to organize it."

We used to take the dogs out that way and rarely ran into anyone on any of the loops.  (edit: detail)

bloomington,2k68wu,marleythebeagle,10,Fri Oct 24 05:50:06 2014 UTC,"It's a systemic failure.  Part of it (actually, probably most of it) comes down to lazy-ass street design. If you look at other countries that have superior traffic safety records you'll notice many thoughtful designs employed—especially at intersections—that are uncommon here.  Street features like mid-block crossings, shared space, curbless streets, protected cycle lanes, different signal timing, roundabouts, changing the middle two lanes of a street into a turn lane, etc. can improve safety and traffic flow.  But of course those all take time and money so meanwhile you are left with one-size-fits-all solutions like overuse of stop signs—which naturally get ignored as much as possible.  Or how about conflicting signs? Ever walk down the B-line trail and see those 'traffic does not stop' signs for the trail, and 'yield' for the streets crossing the trail? So who should yield? Or how about those silly 'share the road' signs. Cyclists think those signs are directed at motorists. Motorists think they're directed at cyclists. Pointless.  Same goes for laws and their enforcement. Cyclists should be fined for riding without lights. Motorists should be fined for not yielding to pedestrians. But again, it takes time, money, and political will to do all this, so it doesn't get done very quickly."
bloomington,2k68wu,eobanb,2,Fri Oct 24 15:27:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks. This is really informative.  Do you study urban planning?  It seems like the cheapest and easiest route would be stepped-up enforcement, but you then have to spend manpower and political capital/good will in the community dealing with both the act of enforcing and the fallout.    Perhaps the increased revenue could be earmarked for some of the infrastructural improvements you suggested (at least in high-traffic, multiple-use areas)?"
bloomington,2k68wu,eobanb,3,Fri Oct 24 17:41:45 2014 UTC,"I used to think it would just be as simple as earmarking money too, but it's not.  The city's various commissions and boards already have project lists and priority levels for the items, but they don't always align or they require the participation of some other unit in order to get done.  For example, let's say you wanted to improve the intersection of 3rd St and Smith Rd on the east side. There are obvious ways you could improve it—there are crosswalks on only two of the four sides of the intersection, for example. So who spearheads that effort? Is it the Bike & Ped Safety commission? Public Safety? Public Works? MPO Citizens Advisory committee? Plan Commission? Sidewalk committee? Traffic commission? Some of those boards have no real power or budget and are just there to provide input, not actually do anything.  But anyway, the answer is actually...in this particular case, none of those! Because that section of 3rd is part of State Road 46, which means now it's up to INDOT.  Isn't bureaucracy fun?  Besides, as soon as you 'earmark' money for something it potentially takes away from something else. Is it important to build new sidewalks along a road near the edge of town that currently has no sidewalks? Sure, but perhaps it is more important to replace older sidewalks in high-traffic areas with ADA-compliant ones (like, with ramps at crossings for wheelchairs).  Maybe you're getting depressed by now because it all sounds a bit hopeless, but rest assured that the current state of things is actually much better than it ever has been. When I first moved here about ten years ago the B-line trail didn't even exist, and west 3rd St was a narrow two-lane road with no sidewalks.  P.S. if you really care about this stuff, find out when commissions and boards meet, download some of their previous meetings' minutes so you can get an idea of what they discuss, and attend (they're all open to the public, after all)."
bloomington,2k68wu,simbanosamba,2,Fri Oct 24 19:27:26 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, and especially the link to relevant committees!   As you suggested, I did in fact look over the list of committees and filed a report with the ""Sidewalk Commission"" concerning some areas where public safety and motorist-pedestrian (and perhaps cyclist-related) issues could be resolved with additional sidewalks.    I also noted the Bicycle & Pedestrian Safety Commission's next meeting on 11/17, so I hope to attend though work obligations may prevent this.  Even if I can't make it, I'll be sending a detailed email to planning@bloomington.in.gov, and I hope you -- and others concerned -- might also be willing to email the commission and other relevant parties.  Thanks again!"
bloomington,2k68wu,AnusHoldus,3,Sat Oct 25 07:12:56 2014 UTC,"I've noticed recently that many cyclists have been riding erratically on the streets. I bike around town nearly everyday, and drive occasionally. In both situations I am alarmed at the riding styles of many cyclists. Maybe I just notice these things because I'm new to the area (my previous town was not friendly to cyclists, meaning you had to constantly be on the defense).   I'd be willing to draft up a PSA flyer on cycling safety rules on the street as a sort of informative template. But those sorts of band-aids only do so much. (It seems like many cyclists here don't know more complex etiquette which would be very helpful in order to communicate with motorists.  PM me if you'd like some companionship on this journey. I'm glad I'm not the only one worried about this. I was about to post something about it myself."

Officers went into the stall and found a 22-year-old male unconscious on the floor surrounded by two spoons, a used syringe and aluminum foil with a white powder substance on it. The man had a pulse and was transported to IU Health Bloomington.
