YesFap,3bfh76,Tundra340,9,Sun Jun 28 19:28:15 2015 UTC,I think masturbation has nothing to do with your problems
YesFap,3bfh76,cantelope4,3,Mon Jun 29 00:10:33 2015 UTC,"This isn't NoFap dude, all we care here is about the joy of fapping.   http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xurzk4_andrea-rincon-realizo-su-cano-en-bailando-2012-showmatch_shortfilms"
YesFap,3bfh76,soparamens,2,Mon Jun 29 17:16:56 2015 UTC,"Dude 21 is NOTHING. You still have it.   Of course if you want to blame your problems on something like fapping, you can do that. If you don't even watch porn, I think it's beneficial. Fapping (not all day everyday) lets you know more about your body, which leads to bigger self-awareness, which leads to more happiness.  I think this nofap stuff has the potential of creating tension in life, causing stress over nothing. At least it did for me. Take care"
YesFap,3akn92,grumpnotso,8,Sun Jun 21 03:19:18 2015 UTC,"Meh, they are trying to live a better life. If they were unhappy then, and they're happy now; who gives a fuck. They can blame waffles for their past problems for all I care. I'm just a part of this sub because I love fapping :)"
YesFap,3akn92,exemplarypotato,-1,Sun Jun 21 18:41:36 2015 UTC,"They probably have WMDs, and we are going to invade them."
YesFap,3akn92,ScaryKingTarzan,3,Thu Jun 25 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"You're going to invade 158k users forum with 400 users, from whom probably a big part is from NoFap, just reading about it. And what exactly is the point of this raid? What you gonna get if more people are going to fap?"
YesFap,3akn92,ScaryKingTarzan,3,Sun Jun 28 18:25:33 2015 UTC,ALL MUST FAP OR ALL MUST DIE.
YesFap,3akn92,ScaryKingTarzan,2,Sun Jun 28 19:00:37 2015 UTC,"I don't see where is the problem... You know, people can get addicted to pretty much everything. So it's like going to AA meeting with a list of benefits from alcohol - they know about them, but the bad side of it  caused too much pain to them to benefit from, let's say one beer per day (which is healthy), or glass of wine or anything. Until they don't attack anyone else with it I guess it's okay, just like with religion. Or vegetarianism. I don't care if someone's muslim, or catholic or doesn't eat meat or does crossfit unless they try to convince me they are better than me because of something and they have the key to heaven, health or wisdom. So I don't see the point of butthurt with ""Ohhhh, fuck these guys, they don't watch porn"", it's like homophobic approach towards gays ""Ohhh, I can't stand that someone, somewhere is fucking another man in the ass!"". Same approach, man. I don't see them anywhere saying that fappers are wrong, or unhealthy, or anything - just that sex is better than porn and some people can control how much porn they consume and some don't."
YesFap,3akn92,ScaryKingTarzan,3,Sun Jun 28 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, and another thing: I don't know if fucking your hand every now and then while watching how other people have sex on the screen is a good reason to create a community. I mean, is it really something you'd like to defend and choose over real sex? Would you go with a shirt with ""I masturbate frequently"" or talk to your grandma about your favourite porn, or to your friends, or to your girlfriend? I find it kind of immature, I mean maybe I'd defend it if I were 14, but now I've got different perspective. It's not something I'd be proud of. It certanly isn't something to be ashamed of, as masturbation is natural, but it's not more proud experience than taking a dump, you know. Maybe try to get laid ;)"
YesFap,3akn92,sneeku,0,Sun Jun 28 18:07:04 2015 UTC,What an original and unexpected response.
YesFap,3akn92,ScaryKingTarzan,2,Sun Jun 28 18:14:35 2015 UTC,"What a meritorical answer ;) Really, get laid and then talk about how much you'd like to get a dick in your hand. Not that it's bad, but there is a better use to it, right?"
YesFap,3741ac,Sword777,3,Sun May 24 17:58:08 2015 UTC,"I fap up to three times a day, and you know what I have to say to you? Fuck you. I'm fine. Go suck a dick and cry some more."

Good for you, as masturbation is healthy as much as you don't focus your sexual energy only on it. NoFap is not for everyone, in the same way that not everyone who likes to drink from time to time needs to go to AA. There is a difference in getting drunk at a party few times a month and getting wasted everyday, same goes with masturbation."

Yesfap has been around for a while, and basically they're just joking about us INSIDE their own subreddit. There's no problem with that: everything can and should be mocked, and if they don't like nofap, we can't change that. Anyaway, the trolls that were on nofap recently are not a normal occurance, and the yesfap moderators aren't happy with it either. Best is to ignore it, and to report to the moderators. We happen to have very good ones! Good luck with your continued quest!"

YesFap,32trt8,VDKay,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything OP.  The amount of noFappers that demonize fapping and porn is too damn high! There is nothing wrong with it, as there is nothing wrong with the well-thought and the responsible decision to stop doing it. It saddens me immensely to see people literally torture themselves by furiously forcing themselves to abstain from fapping for countless consecutive days.  And don't get me started on ""superpowers""! It is just an over-accumulation of corticosteroids. Nothing mystical about it. And, yes, the energy surge and improved focus is all fine until you get a heart attack.  Fapping is an addiction. Yes, it can cause problems. But ""healing"" should be done in a much healthier way I believe. Just like there are re-hab clinics that clean a person from an addiction gradually. And seeing that noFap has taken such great proportions, it troubles me to find that there are so little (physical and psycholocigal) medically-supported fap addiction re-hab movements."

YesFap,2wtu4x,ScaryKingTarzan,4,Sun Jun 28 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"So... seriousness in this sub is interesting... but hey, i'll bite.  What follows are my personal opinions, so take them for what they're worth.    My shift in porn searches to ""harder"" stuff  Fear of losing interest in a real relationship  Social anxiety (has gotten much better last year and probably was more connected to me being a nerd and my gaming addiction than to masturbation and porn)  Time  Will power     So?  Most porn is meant to be a fantasy.  There's nothing wrong with fantasizing about pretty much anything (provided you don't actually act on things that would hurt another person).  I'm definitely into some porn that involves situations that I'd likely never put myself in in reality, and that stuff doesn't really play into my general sex life. Are you noticing this as a problem?  Millions... billions of people watch porn and masturbate, and yet they seek and find real relationships. Are you just afraid of this happening, or is it actually happening to you? I still don't quite understand how anyone thinks that porn/masturbation leads to social anxiety, low self-esteem, whatever.  What I think forcing yourself to refrain from it likely does is create a situation where you know there's no sexual gratification unless you go out and find it.  That might work for some people, but probably doesn't work for most people, because most people don't find someone to screw every time they're out looking for it.  It just sounds frustrating. How long does it take?  I mean, I need a good 30-45 minutes or it feels like a waste... but that's usually right before bed or when I'm not doing anything else.  I think I can spare that little bit of time for myself during the day.   Willpower for its own sake is pointless. Willpower is situational.  You don't magically become a better person because you're exercising your willpower in a context where it doesn't really matter.  Want to quit smoking? Great! Willpower works really well there.  Overeating? Same!     I'm going to say that unless you really think that porn/masturbation is having a real adverse affect on your life, there's no point in forcing yourself to abstain.  Anecdotally, I entertain myself at least once a day, and still have a great and fulfilling sex life.  Like, sex with really attractive dudes.  Really decent and sometimes amazing sex with people I shouldn't even be attractive to.  In fact, i just had sex... like, an hour ago, with a mind-blowingly attractive guy, and I really don't think not masturbating would have made that any better.  Ultimately, it's up to you. You can always try it, and if you don't like it, stop.  Don't buy into the ""super powers"" nonsense, and don't feel like a failure if you start masturbating again.  You don't have to join a cult to see how it makes you feel.  If life improves, great! If it doesn't, then you know it's not a problem for you."

YesFap,2cjvlm,anonagent,3,Tue Aug 12 18:38:42 2014 UTC,"Here's the thing. OP, and many like him aren't looking for relationships, or kids, or whatever the fuck bullshit you're peddling. they serve no purpose to them at all and they've chosen to live their life without any of that."
YesFap,2cjvlm,dabnoob,1 point,Mon Sep 1 10:14:44 2014 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""women is much more than sex.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies fapping, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls women sex. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""sex family"" you're referring to the thematical grouping of sexual actions, which includes things from nutlicking to blue balls to blowjobs.  So your reasoning for calling a woman sex is because random people ""call women sexy?"" Let's get fleshlights and blow-up dolls in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or a woman? It's not one or the other, that's not how humanity works. They're both. A woman is a woman and a member of the sexy  gender. But that's not what you said. You said a woman is sex, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the woman family sex, which means you'd call blue balls, rimming, and other sexual actions women, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"
YesFap,2cjvlm,FantasticMisterSocks,6,Wed Dec 3 22:54:15 2014 UTC,Holy shit. This comment is old. I can't believe you replied to this hahahaha
YesFap,2cjvlm,kanaduhisfruityeh,2,Wed Dec 3 23:04:56 2014 UTC,Cost of child support payments? $0.00  Cost of dates? $0.00  Cost of going out to meet women? $0.00  Busting a nut without any bullshit?  Priceless
YesFap,2cjvlm,soparamens,2,Thu Sep 4 23:40:54 2014 UTC,"I have hundreds of great looking ladies waiting for me in my harddrive. They never complain, ask me for expensive gifts or even hugs."

YesFap,2a4a49,berry889,5,Tue Jul 8 05:02:31 2014 UTC,PSssh. Light weight. Fapped twice today. 150ish gigs of porn.  Never regretted a thing.
YesFap,2a4a49,jukerainbows,8,Wed Oct 1 20:11:59 2014 UTC,"I think it is like the differents between someone that drinks alcohol occasionally and someone who is an alcoholic.(with the differents that there is no proofen general harmfullness of masturbation.)  If a person realy has a big addiction problem, abstinence can be a solution for that person, but it is no solution for everybody. Some alcohol therapies also teach controlled drinking instead of abstinence, so controlled fapping can also be a solution for some people.  But i think many people on NoFap don't have a real problem. They just want to do something to feel more valuable."

YesFap,23z0be,idrink211,8,Fri Apr 25 18:41:09 2014 UTC,always yesfap
YesFap,23z0be,soparamens,3,Sat Apr 26 00:15:14 2014 UTC,"This.  I think the nofappers make good points, but for those of us that can control ourselves, it may be a bit much.   All the complicated explaining aside, I'm on a nearly 30 day streak since any ejaculation.  Edged a few times during that period. Saving it up for when my SO (recent bed-rest, twins, breastfeeding ...)   Sex only a handful of times in 12 months.  There have been times when I just wanna be alone and enjoy the one and only fetish I have.  I wanna be ready for her when she finally comes around to wanting it a few times a week again.   But there have been times during the last 12 months where yesfap has been my only release."

YesFap,1xyzv5,ScoobyTits,1 point,Thu May 22 07:56:48 2014 UTC,"Yep. Why the fuck would there be a link between porn and ED?  However, overloading with fapping and especially in combination with extreme porn WILL desensitize your dick for a while. Your junior can't go on forever you know. Give it a fucking rest.  Also, everything in moderation."
YesFap,1xyzv5,131016,-1,Mon Jun 9 07:36:12 2014 UTC,funny...seems to be coincidence that 2 weeks of nofap healed my erectile dysfunction.
YesFap,1xyzv5,131016,5,Wed Mar 12 11:00:43 2014 UTC,"Maybe coincidence, placebo effect or maybe it wasn't erectile dysfunction to begin with? Maybe you we're just bored of wanking."
YesFap,1xyzv5,thealthor,-2,Wed Mar 12 12:09:05 2014 UTC,"i dont have a problem with masturbating. i think its normal. i also dont like these nofap fanatics (even though i subscribed there) who think touchig your penis is bad. But 2 weeks abstinence and after that massive regulation changed the situation completly for me. before, i couldnt even get an erection :/"
