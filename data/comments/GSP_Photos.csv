GSP_Photos,3cde63,timothy53,3,Tue Jul 7 01:13:15 2015 UTC,"First of all - congratulations on your new pup!  I found a 30' leash helpful with the training as far as teaching her a recall command.   I can't stress enough how important ""busy"" toys were for my GSP, and still are. I used the Kong Wobbler to feed her so that it would wear her out a little. I also found a puzzle ball on Amazon that it takes her a while to get treats out of, so that is helpful. On bad weather days where she can't get outside to play as much, I put treats in about half the cups of a muffin tin and then cover the muffin tin holes with tennis balls.   A harness helped me with my dog when she was younger because I could just grab it as she ran by me. She also wore it during training because it helped me redirect her if need be.  Good luck!"

GSP_Photos,3anptm,goldandguns,3,Mon Jun 22 15:43:30 2015 UTC,"We went on walks twice a day, dedicated walks for training not for exercise (all running of leash so as not to cause confusion). Put cut up hot dog in your hand and hold it in front of your dogs nose and give you command for walk. keep feeding him hot dog bits (or other high value soft treat) as you go to keep his attention and give positive reinforcement for your ""heel"" command (eg ""good heel, good heel""). Do this a ton and keep the walks very short, down the block and back.   It's super hard in the beginning because they think you're just giving away hot dog but they figure out the rules quickly.   Those harnesses often will make your dog pull harder since they don't have that pain on their throat. I don't recommend them!"
GSP_Photos,3anptm,cowens,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"We used a gentle leader with our GSP. It hasn't prevented pulling, but has made it better. I may try that hotdog trick."

Here is a list of regional rescue groups: http://rescue.gspca.org/regional.html  As a breed they can be a handful. It isn't uncommon for people to get one, find they are way over their head, and give them up. I got mine from a rescue group and she's been great."
GSP_Photos,362gtl,SunriseThunderboy,3,Fri May 15 18:18:27 2015 UTC,I'd strongly recommend finding and contacting your local NAVHDA chapter. They'll be able to direct you to some reputable breeders.
GSP_Photos,362gtl,HeyWow,2,Fri May 15 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"It took us almost a year to find our GSP. Several months of research and then some more on a waiting list so your experience is not unusual.  Which breeder you go to depends a lot on why you want a pointer and what you will be doing with the dog. We found ours through a gun dog breeder site. If you are going to hunt with the dog, your local hunting clubs or nahvda may be able to point you in the right direction. There are some dog breeders who will allow one of their pups to go to a non hunting home but even then they may require you to have owned a GSP in the past. These are not dogs for beginners.   If you are looking to adopt, there are breed specific rescues, they can be harder to find on the internet.  New Beginnings GSP rescue in Maryland seems to have several available.   GSPs are a healthy breed but require a lot of attention and exercise. I am guessing the reason the dogs posted here look so healthy and happy is because they are getting plenty of both."
GSP_Photos,362gtl,eirly,2,Fri May 15 18:03:31 2015 UTC,I found my boy at a random shelter.  I wasn't looking for a particular breed but he was the most well behaved and loving dog there so he came home with us. Please check the rescue groups.  They're still great dogs needing homes.

I know some people are against it but I think it really does help them when out hunting. They curl it under their butts to sit on it so they don't sit directly on the ground.  I have a Vizsla with a docked tail too but I know the international community members are really against it.

Because of this, he could not be registered nor sold, so the owners did not put any additional expenses into him or his siblings, which included not docking the tails.  I don't utilize him for hunting, so the tail being undocked is not a big deal.  I think it gives him more personality!"

GSP_Photos,2ykmgk,5ivehead,10,Tue Mar 10 16:33:54 2015 UTC,"That's great and all, but I think we all need to pray they never become more popular.  Commercial breeding has destroyed the fitness and suitability of many breeds (goldens and labs being the obvious example) for any sort of work.  I'd like the GSP breed to remain exceptionally healthy for the foreseeable future, and leave breeding up to dedicated hunting and sport breeders who actually care about whether a dog's hips and eyes will still function after they're sold."
GSP_Photos,2ykmgk,Abeds_Skinny_Jeans,3,Tue Mar 10 17:29:03 2015 UTC,"For being #12 their name recognition is still low. I tell people about my GSP pup and I get a blank stare back because it isn't a lab, golden retriever, pitbull mix, or some bs toy breed that's more cat then dog."
GSP_Photos,2ykmgk,713attic,2,Tue Mar 10 21:24:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly hope they dont continue gaining in popularity, the rate of turning GSPs in because they can't handle the energy levels is high enough!"

GSP_Photos,2x270r,hvacian,2,Wed Feb 25 02:59:33 2015 UTC,Thanks! I love how sleek the all brown and especially the all black gsps look. Most people don't believe he's all gsp and not a mix. Does that happen to you too?
GSP_Photos,2x270r,hvacian,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"Yea, most think he is a lab."

GSP_Photos,2x270r,weegreen,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:13:31 2015 UTC,It's a Perfect Fit harness. Made in UK. The idea is that you choose the different modules to fit your dog as best as you can. Check out here for more info:  http://dog-games-shop.co.uk/perfect-fit-fleece-dog-harness

GSP_Photos,2wmdm0,mapguy,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:51:11 2015 UTC,Hey I used a harness by Hurtta. http://www.hurtta.com/EN/Products/Harnesses/Padded%20harness/   It doesnt look like it in the picture but mine has 2 rings on the side to attach a sled or cart for pulling. After the round trip of 10 miles in below 10 degree weather Victor was perfectly fine. I didn't see any chaffing at all and he wasn't sensitive to any touching either. Could it be possible the harness you were using is to small or tight?

GSP_Photos,2w18mm,surflessbum,1 point,Mon Feb 16 15:56:58 2015 UTC,Yep. We've been known to throw empty cereal boxes and the like his way just because he loves to tear them to bits.   Usually on days when he hasn't gotten enough exercise :/

GSP_Photos,2v8bsh,tsr6,2,Sun Feb 8 22:22:03 2015 UTC,Just a sticky roller/pet fur remover before you leave the house (and one in the car). It picks up most things. Such is the life with an inside fur friend. Just accept it.. :)
