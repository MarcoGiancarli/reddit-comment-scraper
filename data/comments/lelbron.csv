lelbron,3chmrd,gmikeygdizzle,3,Tue Jul 7 23:51:22 2015 UTC,"I can give you so tips, what programs are you using?  What I use, I use Adobe After Effects, but you can use Photoshop as well just not as easy."
lelbron,3chmrd,36DD,2,Wed Jul 8 03:25:31 2015 UTC,I'm using the Adobe suite as well
lelbron,3chmrd,36DD,2,Wed Jul 8 22:39:39 2015 UTC,"Nice!    What do you need help with specifically?  Read what's written below by /u/codyave.  Here's a good video to follow as well:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz0ObpGw_z0&index=6&list=PLdgcshIMmaa2iNJ6BXf_JBARKA0cvXhaU  Also, take a look through /r/Giftutorials, lots of ideas there.    If you get stuck with anything....always feel free to ask questions here, make a thread about it, or just message the mods here, we're always willing to help."
lelbron,3chmrd,codyave,4,Wed Jul 8 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"After Effects is best for animation.   Import a video (I also like to lock it in place) Import a lelbron.png (PNG so it preserves transparency) Position/scale/rotate lelbron, and set a keyframe if you expect one of these expressions will change throughout your composition. If, for instance, the head size will not change, you can leave the ""Scale"" expression keyframe-less As you progress through each frame of your composition, adjust lelbron as needed. If an object moves in front of lelbron, you will need to apply a mask to the lelbron layer. A youtube masking tutorial can be found here When finished, press Ctrl + M, go to your Render window, click on ""lossless"" and select PNG sequence (I think that's what it is) from the top drop-down menu instead of the default AVI (unless you really know what you're doing, I usually don't) Adjusting the scale of the PNG sequence is usually necessary to something reasonable like 360x240, as gifs that are movie-sized can be around ~30MB Hit ""Render"" In Photoshop, open up the folder that was just rendered, click on the first image, and then in the information bar at the bottom of the window hit the ""Open as a Sequence"" checkbox, and click OK. You will be prompted to input the FPS for the gif -- you can double-check this by looking at the input source back in After Effects (if you don't get it right, you will get duplicate or skipped frames in your gif) If everything looks good, press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S to Save for Web Select ""GIF"" in the top drop-down box, and select ""Forever"" instead of ""Once"" in the looping animations drop-down box (if you don't do this, people on the internet will laugh at you) Upload to your favorite website, and share! Here's a picture of Lelbron uploading his favorite gif"
lelbron,3chmrd,36DD,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"That's actually pretty spot on with what to do.    The only thing I would add to this is to always remember the ideal gif settings in PS:  http://i.imgur.com/JXG4S7R.png  Pretty much just change the default setting of ""Selective"" right underneath where it says ""GIF"", and change it to ""Adaptive""."
