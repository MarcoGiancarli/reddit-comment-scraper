MMA,3e2221,LegionPeep,12,Tue Jul 21 14:44:36 2015 UTC,"A quick primer for those coming from r/all/.   UFC 189 was supposed to be the featherweight (145 lb.) championship fight between Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor. Jose Aldo is one of the most dominant champions in UFC history, with a 10-year win streak, never having lost a title defense Conor McGregor is the hot new thing.  He is charismatic, has a flashy style and is a world class trash-talker. The UFC spent an ungodly amount of money promoting this dream fight. Prior to UFC 189, even McGregor's detractors acknowledged that he is an excellent striker.  Many however challenged his grappling credentials and felt that the UFC had ""protected"" him from strong grapplers in his weight class like Chad Mendes. With two weeks to go before the fight, Jose Aldo pulls out due to a rib injury (although there were also shenanigans with a drug test that may or may not have played a role) and is replaced by none other than the aforementioned McGregor-kryptonite, Chad Mendes. In the end, McGregor won the fight in dramatic fashion with a second round knockout (GIF). It was one of the most hyped UFC events of all time and most agree that it delivered.   Edit: UFC 189 was great for other reasons too, but the bump in traffic is almost certainly due to the McGregor-Mendes fight."
MMA,3e2221,Froghead_Jr,6,Tue Jul 21 15:23:26 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like we saw much impressive about McGregor's grappling. Mendes did with him what he wanted, and I feel like the other decent wrestlers will too.  What was more impressive was how McGregor used body shots  while he was on his feet to wear down Mendes over time."
MMA,3e2221,SD99FRC,2,Tue Jul 21 15:14:36 2015 UTC,I was thinking that too but fact is he got taken down 4 times which means he also got up 4 times so that's not so bad.
MMA,3e2221,Elanthius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"He had decent TDD and his defensive guard was pretty good.  TBF his offensive guard was almost non-existent, he did nothing threatening beyond his Kenneth Florini hellbows, no sweeps or submissions to speak of.    (People are acting like because he got taken down that his TDD was awful, Aldo got taken down by Mendes too, and he has the best TDD in the division.)  He recognized his opportunities to stand, scrambling and standing up very well.  Even though Mendes got the takedowns, Conor standing up from under Mendes isnt something to be overlooked.  His grappling wasnt ""impressive"" but it was enough to escape the #1 or #2 wrestler in the division. (Frankie being the other)  Mendes got to do with him what he wanted, but apparently he didnt want to keep McGregor down or to win, he wanted to give up position and get knocked the fuck out.  I dont think any ""decent"" wrestler will do with him whatever they wish based on the performance of an elite wrestler being able to take him down and being unable to finish or to keep him there.  He has enough grapples that it is going to take an elite to do so.  I dont think anyone besides Frankie Edgar is going to have the takdedowns and top control to be able to keep him down in the division."

I could feel him constantly using just enough pressure to stop me from whatever I was doing.

However your game didn't look all that bad considering the situation. I'd be nervous as hell. And that shows a little at the start.  What belt are you?
MMA,3e33ka,temp_jits,10,Tue Jul 21 16:24:37 2015 UTC,He is a 2 stripe purple belt. He could probably out grapple 95% of the population without a problem. That is how good Jacare is as he was going maybe 10%.

MMA,3e3gjz,Rocksaysso,7,Tue Jul 21 17:46:39 2015 UTC,People were saying Cowboy was angry against Myles Jury because of what Myles said after the Diego Sanchez fight. And we know how that fight went.
MMA,3e3gjz,Whaleskin13,3,Tue Jul 21 18:29:58 2015 UTC,Especially since RDA is such a pressure fighter.
MMA,3e3gjz,it1345,18,Tue Jul 21 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"cowboy cerrone tested positive for the performance enhancing drug, hydrochlorothiazide, in 2007 when he fought kenneth alexander at wec 30.  cowboy cerrone is in no position to accuse anyone of taking performance enhancing drugs when he was found guilty of cheating."
MMA,3e3gjz,mma21x,7,Tue Jul 21 18:00:57 2015 UTC,Hydrochlorothiazide is not a performance enhancer.  It's a diuretic for weight cutting purposes.  It does give an advantage as in he can lose more weight but it's not going to make him perform better.
MMA,3e3gjz,kentuckyfried42,16,Tue Jul 21 18:13:21 2015 UTC,"Well, a good weight cut and diet is very important for a fighter's performance. If the drug gives an edge in easier weight cut, isn't that performance enhancing drug?"
MMA,3e3gjz,_Fish_,6,Tue Jul 21 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"isn't that performance enhancing drug?   Not according to WADA. Regardless, the concern is that it can be used to mask the use of actual PED's."
MMA,3e3gjz,JDGcamo,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:20 2015 UTC,"I see your argument and agree to a point.  A good diet could be considered performance enhancing as well.  I'm just saying, it's not the same as taking steroids."

MMA,3e3gjz,_Fish_,6,Tue Jul 21 18:41:39 2015 UTC,"according to USADA, the anti-doping testing agency for the ufc, hydrochlorothiazide is a performance enhancing drug.  http://www.usada.org/wp-content/uploads/wada-2015-prohibited-list-en.pdf"
MMA,3e3gjz,mma21x,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:24:48 2015 UTC,So are marijuana and heroin.  It doesn't mean that it actually enhances performance like a steroid would.  Steroids make your body incredibly stronger as well as allow your body to recover multiple times faster than someone that is not on them.
MMA,3e3gjz,kentuckyfried42,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"if ""it doesn't mean that it actually enhances performance"" as you say, cowboy cerrone should not have been found guilty of taking a performancing enhancing drug, suspended, and had his fight overturned as a no-contest.  yet, the nevada athletic commission found cowboy cerrone guilty of the taking a performance enhancing drug.  so, you think you're right and usada and the nevada athletic commission is wrong?"
MMA,3e3gjz,mma21x,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:42 2015 UTC,You could arguee that marijuana and heroin can act as a pain enhibator allowing people to train past the point they would normally be able to without it so yes they are performance enhancing drugs.

There's lots of reasons to believe he abused the shit out of PEDs though.  I happen to think RDA's sudden rise to success isn't just based on hard work.  Call me a cinic, but just because RDA hasn't tested positive yet, doesn't really mean shit.  His athletic and explosive gains are extremely suspect considering we had a pretty large sample size of him before he started running through guys about 2 years ago."

It was also a commentary on how folks are just writing him off outright in the rematch:   While that is the tragedy of combat sports—to fans you are either undefeated or you're a bum—it also demonstrates how comprehensive a dismantling Dillashaw's performance was.   But titles sometimes upset me too before I read things, don't worry.  (As an aside, it's worth noting that his winning streak was only about 22 fights because he got soccer kicked in the head and was unable to continue, resulting in a no contest.)"

He went on to lose like what after 4 more fights   People act like he won 30 fights in the UFC or WEC and held a belt forever. But neither is true
MMA,3e2zvn,Kid__Killer__McGee,-5,Tue Jul 21 18:32:52 2015 UTC,"It didn't help that he never fought Dom for the belt. It was just given to him because of Dom's injuries. Then TJ comes along and completely dismantles him, and when you factor in how many members of that win streak were nobodies it doesn't look so great. Plus, he certainly didn't do himself any favors with the way he looked in his last fight."
MMA,3e2zvn,tamatamatamatama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:25 2015 UTC,Interesting that you bring Dominick Cruz into this because personally I feel some of the darting in and out and angle changes are very similar to what TJ was doing.

MMA,3e2zvn,Acemyke,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:12 2015 UTC,"People seem to forget that the TJ that fought Barao was something NOBODY saw coming at all. His game plan was executed fantastically, his team and him were able to dissect hours of footage on one of the YOUNGEST champions ever. His next fight was against Joe Soto with ONE DAY'S notice to prepare, and still he took Dillasahw to the championship rounds. Dillashaw's biggest mistake was not finishing that kid earlier.  What everyone else is forgetting is that TJ just gave Barao 50 MINUTES of footage on this newly crafted Dillashaw to poke through. Yes, it will be an absolute technical war, without a doubt, but say for example Barao comes out in southpaw instead of orthodox, that wonderful and highly executable game plan of Dillashaw's may very well disintegrate before our eyes, and reality will set in."

He has lost 1 of his 21 fights, and after coming back off of a two year layoff, he starched Mizugaki with some amazing striking.  You can talk about being caught off guard all you want and what you could watch on film, but at the end of the day, Barao lost to a style that is not dissimilar to part of what made Dom so frustrating for guys and they had plenty of tape on him and still lost. Barao also did not look very good in his fight against Gagnon who I don't even think is a ranked fighter in the division."

Story for those interested:   His nickname Barão (baron), which predates his athletic career, was given to him by his grandmother after a character in the 1986 Brazilian soap opera Sinhá Moça   Unrelated, this sequence is a good example of what I don't like about the UFC's camera-work:  http://i.imgur.com/F899rAs.gif  I'd rather just have a cheap-looking shot of the whole cage if it means I can see the feet."
MMA,3e2zvn,Rampage1995,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:55 2015 UTC,While that is the tragedy of combat sports—to fans you are either undefeated or you're a bum—it also demonstrates how comprehensive a dismantling Dillashaw's performance was.   one of the things that bothers me the most about people here. if you didn't beat someone in the top 3 then you are a bum who beats cans. Everyone is a can unless they are the champ or a top 3. it's absurd.  if you beat people in the UFC they are generally not cans. not sure why i'm being downvoted. are you guys saying then that everyone is a can?
MMA,3e2zvn,BetaCarotine20mg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:50 2015 UTC,Robin Black on the Fight Network after UFC 189 said some very interesting things about the evolution of MMA and how he thinks Nova Uniao ran the show for 5 years but that their reign is coming to an end because their styles are being surpassed/outdated by the likes of up and comers like Dillashaw and Mcgregor who have improved on and evolved current MMA.  That eventually we will see a kryptonite of dominant fighters like Mighty Mouse's style that will revolutionize MMA and that it will continue to happen due to all the variables in MMA.  Was very interesting to listen to.  edit: typo
MMA,3e2zvn,NickyMcNikolai,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:48 2015 UTC,Aldo hasn't lost in 10 years and Barao lost once since 2005 and their reign is coming to an end? That's a premature statement.
MMA,3e2zvn,brockcene,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:18 2015 UTC,"very well could be, we shall see.  edit: i am not saying i agree with it, i am saying it was interesting to hear his take on it and see if it happens."
MMA,3e2zvn,Zeckdo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"It's one of those situations where if you say it for long enough, it will eventually happen.  The fight game passes everyone by.  But, I do think Barao is outgunned stylistically if he comes in similarly to his last fight.  His striking is very effective but it is rather minimalistic.  In the road to UFC video, he even started brawling with an overmatched sparring partner.  That is a troubling sign, as one of Barao's problems is that he likes to get wild and brawl instead of staying composed and technical - possibly because his bag of tricks is not particularly deep.  TJ has many more methods of attack, and defensive movement.  His wrestling base and team also adds an element that should be respected, though he has not been inclined to use it recently.  It would be interesting if Barao made it a grappling match, we don't get to see much of he or Aldo grappling.  But the speed and accuracy of his back take a few fights back was amazing."
MMA,3e2zvn,MMAbandit,3,Tue Jul 21 19:00:32 2015 UTC,I really don't see that. Barao was always sloppy and it was only a matter of time before someone took advantage of it. Aldo on the other hand is a very technically sound fighter.
MMA,3e2kpk,Mr_Weebles,10,Tue Jul 21 13:51:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, a union in this case happens to be the ""bad guy"". But Mises is against all unions in general, so fuckem.   Are unions perfect? Of course not. Many have run well beyond their intended objectives. But giving working class people bargaining power against shitty owners is essential.   The article is especially ironic considering how much MMA needs a fighters union. The ufc treats their employee like shit and gives them no say in managing their futures collectively (forced rebok deal, needed brain injury prevention programs, wages, benefits, pensions, etc., etc.). In every other major sports league the players union provide bargaining power for their collective self interest. It shouldn't just be corporate CEOs making these important decisions. CEOs SOLE purpose is to cut costs and maximize profits; not the philosophy you want governing these decisions.   TL;DR Fuck the culinary union, but fuck Mises' anti-union philosophy even more.   Edit: The Fertitta brothers are worth a combined $3.14 billion according to Forbes. And you've got fighters headlining events for $12,000, not to mention what fighters on the undercard make. If that seems ethical to you, suck deez nuts."
MMA,3e2kpk,prematurepost,3,Tue Jul 21 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"But Mises is against all unions in general, so fuckem.    Not true -- the economists you are referring to are huge supporters of the right to associate and enter into private agreements under all circumstances, whether by unions or others.   What they oppose is the use of violence (or the threat thereof) by union members or by any government authority on behalf of unions. Unions are well known for co-opting the state to use force on their behalf and alter what would otherwise be purely voluntary relationships.  And in the earlier part of the 20th century, unions were well known for using brutal violence against strike breakers who took jobs during strikes."
MMA,3e2kpk,zip99,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:26:33 2015 UTC,"Looks at history of Unionization in America: Lattimer massacre, Columbine Mine Massacre, Harlan County strike break, Colorado Labor War, Anaconda Road Massacre, Cateret Massacre, McCarthyism. Decides that Unions are the violent ones... Your brain on Libertarian-ism.   ""During the Lattimer massacre, nineteen unarmed immigrant coal miners were suddenly gunned down at the Lattimer mine near Hazleton, Pennsylvania, on September 10, 1897.[30][31] The miners, mostly of Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian and German ethnicity, were shot and killed by a Luzerne County sheriff's posse. In this group as well, all of the miners had been shot in the back."" (the Posse was composed of deputized mine guards)  Meanwhile in the real world: Congressional Inquiry into industrial violence: ""If the secret agents of employers, working as members of the labor unions, do not always investigate acts of violence, they frequently encourage them. If they did not, they would not be performing the duties for which they are paid, for they are hired on the theory that labor organizations are criminal in character."""
MMA,3e2kpk,Toparov,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:30 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of violence on both sides, (union members attacking scabs, management - blocking/disrupting business operations, etc) but we typically only hear about violence against union workers because it's politically palatable.

I'm assuming the owners didn't beat them up or kill them, correct?   Station casinos stripped it's employees of it's 401K from 2007 to 2012   That sounds awful (also impossible, that would be theft) but I don't see what it has to do with anything."
MMA,3e2kpk,Washbag,0,Tue Jul 21 19:04:37 2015 UTC,"But giving working class people bargaining power against shitty owners is essential.   I just want you to know that people like me (and the people that write for Mises) are not against unions because they give workers bargaining power.  We are against unions because they help skilled workers to the detriment of the lowest paid, lowest skilled workers.  Having said that, I (and Mises writers) do not actually oppose all unions.  We only oppose those unions that are in place as a result of legislation or government force.  People are free to associate however they wish.   It shouldn't just be corporate CEOs making these important decisions. CEOs SOLE purpose is to cut costs and maximize profits; not the philosophy you want governing these decisions.   And it's the purpose of workers like me to try and maximize our pay.  Let's assume that the UFC would want to pay their fighters $1 per fight.  They are unable to do that because all of the fighters would go work for Bellator or coach at a gym or do one of any other number of things.  Payment for anything (in this case, wages) is set by supply and demand.  It isn't the result of the kindness of CEOs or whatever you believe.  If you'd like me to direct you to some more in depth writing about this please let me know."

There is no possible way you can conduct the exact same economic experiment, nor could you even possibly hope to identify a tiny fraction of the variables.  It is like a chemist tossing in chemical X into a constantly changing vat of materials.  For more in depth reading, and since we are on the subject of Mises, here's a free book: Epistemological Problems of Economics   explains why so many of them reject climate change too.

MMA,3e17kl,Newo92,20,Tue Jul 21 17:00:59 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's just how this subreddit is.  Nevermind RDA's shown similarly impressive performances in handling Bendo and decisioning Cerrone/Diaz, while Dillashaw's other great performance was against Joe ""Wait, who?"" Soto."
MMA,3e17kl,Deliciousbalut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:51 2015 UTC,Dillashaw had a near perfect performance against Easton.
MMA,3e17kl,IceCreamPirate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:17 2015 UTC,This thread basically went from diuretic talk to talking about a bunch of fighters titties. I love it.
MMA,3e17kl,ShittyBrain,17,Tue Jul 21 10:28:51 2015 UTC,"First off, it's easier for a bantamweight body to maintain that kind of pace. Secondly, those fights were completely different in terms of energy usage.   There wasn't much grappling at all in Dillashaw/Barao, and really not that many striking combos either. It was a lot of movement by Dillashaw, which is easier to maintain at pace than more strenuous exertion of constant striking. Another good example of this kind of fight would be almost any Edgar fight.   Take Aldo/Mendes for example - that shit is crazy that they kept up that striking pace. DosAnjos/Pettis was pretty high striking pace as well, combined with the grappling that DosAnjos used to stifle Pettis.  I'm not accusing anyone of anything, but you can't compare those fights as if they were even remotely similar."
MMA,3e17kl,tosser_0,9,Tue Jul 21 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"I really dont think there was anything superhuman about RDA's effort. In 5 rounds, Aldo had 289 total strikes against Mendes. Dos Anjos had 233 total strikes against Pettis. Dillashaw had 344 in 4 and a half rounds against Barao, which is absolute insanity. Yes there was more grappling in RDA-Pettis, but RDA was always on top, he made that fight easier for himself and the idea that set an unbelievable pace and had inhuman cardio is overstated"
MMA,3e17kl,JurgenTheNotSoGerman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"344 according to who? Fightmetric shows it at 309 thrown for Dillashaw. Also, there were only 2 takedowns attempted in that fight, while RDA completed 9 against Pettis. Grappling is strenuous as fuck.   And when there is that much grappling you can't use strikes thrown as a direct comparison. Even maintaining top control is significantly more energy consuming than standing and working at distance.   What I'm saying is that the RDA/Pettis fight was tough cardio wise, while Dillashaw/Barao was probably less so, with lighter fighters.   What RDA did was impressive, but I wouldn't say it warrants steroid accusation."
MMA,3e17kl,tosser_0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:41:24 2015 UTC,"I personally don't have any reason to suspect RDA, but I think the difference for people is that RDA seems pretty large and shredded.  And on top of that he seems to have had a resurgence in his career where he has become suddenly dominant.   Just a guess."
MMA,3e17kl,B0h1c4,0,Tue Jul 21 15:44:26 2015 UTC,"Weight classes are a thing. The more you weigh the harder it is to keep a pace like that. Honestly if you can't keep pace at 135 or 125 and you haven't been rocked or ate massive shots during the fight, you really need to take a long hard look at how you are training and how big your weight cut is."
MMA,3e17kl,Kid__Killer__McGee,0,Tue Jul 21 17:26:23 2015 UTC,I know right.   It could not possibly be that RDA has Nick Curson as his strength and conditioning coach and put some serious time into getting his endurance up.
MMA,3e17kl,1Ender,0,Tue Jul 21 17:56:34 2015 UTC,He's also a bantamweight
MMA,3e17kl,nlowery91,56,Tue Jul 21 14:09:39 2015 UTC,After the run RDA has been on. I think he beats cowboy
MMA,3e17kl,HeidiSliman,98,Tue Jul 21 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"I think he almost definitely will. Cowboy has been on a streak but he lost that Bendo fight. He got the decision, but I feel like even he knew that he should have lost."

MMA,3e17kl,KrakatauGreen,15,Tue Jul 21 04:46:01 2015 UTC,Bendo really didn't do anything to win it either. Should have been a draw.
MMA,3e17kl,AGnawedBone,2,Tue Jul 21 04:51:35 2015 UTC,"I wish there were more draws.  If there isn't a clear winner, the fight should be a draw.  It sucks to watch an even fight -- only to see one guy move higher in the rankings and the other guy move lower.  It's almost like they flip a coin."
MMA,3e17kl,PenIslandTours,4,Tue Jul 21 05:29:21 2015 UTC,"What fight were you watching? I know you like cowboy but watch it objectively and re-read the rules. Bendo should have won that unanimously, with respects to both MMA rules and just watching casually."
MMA,3e17kl,noobDuck,18,Tue Jul 21 11:02:19 2015 UTC,"It was a nothing fight, not sure how anyone can speak so definitively about the result.  Looked super subjective I thought."
MMA,3e17kl,EnDirty,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:48 2015 UTC,You should remember that Cowboy fought Jury (a top ten ranked fighter) 15 days before his fight with Bendo. That's kind of an important detail you shouldn't forget when looking at that fight.

MMA,3e17kl,SPACE_CHUPACABRA,5,Tue Jul 21 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"You can still get ties even if you don't score 10-10s.  For example 10-8, 9-10, 9-10.  The 10 must system doesn't preclude having ties at all."

I have my personal score, which liberally uses 10-10, 10-8, and some 10-7s, and then I have ""what I think the judges scored"" which is almost always 10-9s across the board unless someone almost died.  Just because judges suck shit doesn't mean I have to do the same for myself."
MMA,3e17kl,PessimiStick,11,Tue Jul 21 13:19:03 2015 UTC,He beat him already.
MMA,3e17kl,das_vargas,-7,Tue Jul 21 13:53:10 2015 UTC,I agree but Cowboy matches up pretty well with RDA.
MMA,3e17kl,PelikanNutz,17,Tue Jul 21 14:04:25 2015 UTC,Well RDA already UD' him 2 years ago and has improved leaps since then. I don't see anyway this fight isn't a wrestle/grapple fuck.
MMA,3e17kl,FiveDollarShake,5,Tue Jul 21 07:16:32 2015 UTC,RDA did drop Cerrone in their last fight.  Cerrone has obviously become a killing machine since then but RDA's striking has improved just as much.  Starched Bendo and outstruck Pettis for 25 minutes.
MMA,3e17kl,AC_Slater25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:17 2015 UTC,Cerrone can definitely play it rangey and stand with him but he may well get wrestlefucked

Even thou he got punished on foot for the first round, but that's because he got supprised by rda's pressure tactic"
MMA,3e17kl,chuckjerky,5,Tue Jul 21 10:12:29 2015 UTC,he did not get wrestle-fucked for 25 mins I don't know what you watched.
MMA,3e17kl,beastrace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I know but cowboy can go hang with rda on the  feet and he can grapple too.  I think rda puts it all together better and has better wrestling but honestly I think rda beats everyone but khabib.   Saying that cowboy took a round from rda and I'd give him a good a shot as anyone in the lw div not named khabib.
MMA,3e17kl,PelikanNutz,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:52 2015 UTC,Didn't RDA have his ear ripped off sparring. I'd be way more afraid going to training everyday then going into the octagon.

I'm not sticking up for RDA but aren't diuretics also used to mask steroid abuse helping cycle them out? And Cowboy fighting so often (I know he didn't fight as often when caught) wouldn't steroids help him recover faster? But personally I avoid the back and forth of fighters pointing fingers."
MMA,3e17kl,imtimid,38,Tue Jul 21 07:46:10 2015 UTC,"Another thing that is true in bodybuilding. The one's accusing others of steroids usually are on steroids themselves. Of course, the ones they accuse are, too."

MMA,3e17kl,applebuttaz,2,Tue Jul 21 05:35:05 2015 UTC,"Cowboy fighting so often would make it even harder to cycle off given the sheer number of times he would be tested in a year. Given that he said that he felt he only had one good kick in him during that fight with Bendo, I'm thinking he isn't actually recovering and is just fighting with his injuries."
MMA,3e17kl,Matthias_The_Warrior,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:02:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, this. Whatever about in the past, but Cowboys recent string of back to back fights would make it very difficult to be taking a PED. Sure some of them have a very short half life, but still, it would be quite tricky. It's people that back out of fights and have long lay offs that are of concern."
MMA,3e17kl,Nefilim777,17,Tue Jul 21 17:34:19 2015 UTC,It's not even the half life for me. He will actively campaign to take fights against people on short notice if their opponents drop out. That is very difficult to do if you are using. You are talking 15 days between fights at one point. I'm not even sure what his actual notice was on the second fight because it could have been even less than 15 days.
MMA,3e17kl,Matthias_The_Warrior,3,Tue Jul 21 05:38:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. Plus the short half life thing is assuming that a fighter is only using one compound when they're more than likely not. I definitely wouldn't suspect Cowboy of juicing and if he is he's a bloody master at it!
MMA,3e17kl,Nefilim777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:55:12 2015 UTC,There are PEDs you can cycle off in less than 15 days comfortably.
MMA,3e17kl,mesopotato,2,Tue Jul 21 06:39:08 2015 UTC,a lot of things stays in your system for less than a few days. Plus he got caught in the past meh
MMA,3e17kl,Shalamuta,6,Tue Jul 21 07:46:47 2015 UTC,But was he tested at each fight?
MMA,3e17kl,st_michael,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure, tbh."
MMA,3e17kl,Nefilim777,4,Tue Jul 21 16:53:29 2015 UTC,"Good points didn't really consider how hard it would be to yo-yo your cycles if you're stepping up on short notice. Again I don't really care to read into fighters accusing each other. In a sport where talking can benefit you more than performing sometimes all the finger pointing is silly. Cowboy already has the fight but still, it's all talk as of right now."
MMA,3e17kl,imtimid,3,Tue Jul 21 06:53:59 2015 UTC,"Plus you need to keep in mind that a fighter isn't necessarily just taking testosterone, for example. They're probably taking at least two compounds and afterwards will more than likely need some PCT, which could show up in bloods too. So someone who is fighting 4-5 times a year and also opting to take fights on a moments notice almost certainly has nothing to hide."
MMA,3e17kl,Nefilim777,0,Tue Jul 21 07:46:58 2015 UTC,"Uh... two things, A) there are compounds you can cycle off in less than 15 days and B) You don't necessarily need PCT immediately after cycle. Pushing it off a few days isn't going to destroy your body anymore than years of steroid abuse do anyways."
MMA,3e17kl,mesopotato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:41 2015 UTC,"My point was more relating to the fact that cowboy is willing to take fights at the drop of a hat, thus opening himself to sudden testing anywhere within the period of 15 days (his shortest possible notice TTD). If he was in fact taking PEDs he'd be operating on a seriously strange cycle. I realise there are compounds you can cycle off quickly and he may not be even undergoing PCT at all, I'm just saying its unlikely given his patterns."
MMA,3e17kl,Nefilim777,2,Tue Jul 21 07:48:28 2015 UTC,"Test suspension is pretty common and is undetected after a few days (3). That's not the only compound either. plus microdosing, EPO, and a slew of other things. So he probably knows that as soon as a high profile fight rumor comes out, he needs to cycle off.   So, he hears a rumor, starts cycling off day 1. Day 2 he gets the contract, signs it and sends it back. Next day he's completely clean. This is why it's so hard to get rid of PEDs in sports, there are smart people out there telling these athletes what to take, when to take it, how to take it, and how to cycle off."
MMA,3e17kl,mesopotato,3,Tue Jul 21 14:14:38 2015 UTC,So I guess the testing is largely pointless... apart from some 'surprise' tests.
MMA,3e17kl,Nefilim777,3,Tue Jul 21 14:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a common saying is that a drug test is more of an IQ test. If you're greedy and try to dose for too long, you may get caught or you may have a huge advantage in your fight. It's a bit of gamble, but it really opened my eyes reading Victor Conte/BALCO scandal and researching the Lance Armstrong case."
MMA,3e17kl,mesopotato,23,Tue Jul 21 14:32:55 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone think that RDA is on roids?  If anything, his PED of choice would have been EPO.  His body doesn't look unnatural, but his cardiovascular performance against Pettis was unreal.  Not saying he is using, but if he did, that would be my guess"
MMA,3e17kl,kfordham,46,Tue Jul 21 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like everyone just uses the word ""steroids"" as a replacement for PED's..."

MMA,3e17kl,OscarTheMonster,15,Tue Jul 21 12:50:31 2015 UTC,"He also started training with a new strength and conditioning coach and he spent apparently (according to his strength and conditioning coach on the Joe Rogan podcast) like 90% of his camp focusing on strength and conditioning. Which REALLY showed in the pettis fight. Pettis was gassing and RDA kept fighting and pressing. Even from the start RDA just kept a faster pace throughout the fight. And it's not like they weren't trading but RDA didn't slow down as much as pettis did.  All that being said, with performance gains like that, I wouldn't be shocked if he was blood doping."

MMA,3e17kl,KippaxStreet1880,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:03:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, though I do tend to believe he might have taken advantage of blood doping. It's not QUITE the same thing as taking a PED, but it's so fucking easy right now because the ONLY way the commission can tell is if you have traces of plastics in your blood. Which are explained via IV rehydration. And the difference between a fighter who is blood doping vs. not blood doping is HUGE. You talk about altitude being a very major thing for fight training. That's because you need to train your body to operate on lower oxygen because you get tired easier, your muscles start fading quicker with less oxygen. Blood doping is the exact opposite of that. It's harder to get tired, your muscles are 100% for longer, you fight harder. And right now with how easy it is, I wouldn't doubt that a lot of the UFC is doing it."
MMA,3e17kl,snackies,0,Tue Jul 21 14:43:58 2015 UTC,"How can people be so naive as to bother defending a fighter who fought like a superhuman for five rounds straight and had a career resurgence out of nowhere relatively late in their life?

You have more to lose if you're lying, so the stakes are higher and I would be more willing to take your word and be less suspicious by default than someone who just avoids the subject. Just my opinion. I know that if I were a clean athlete, surrounded by steroid users, and someone accused me...I'd have no problem being vocal about my history since I would be proud of it.

They get signed by M1, KSW or other regional promotions where they usually make a lot more than what the UFC offers for newcomers.  Why did the UFC get guys like Chris de la Rocha or Ruan Potts instead of Rama and Ivanov? On one side you have guys in their 20s who are still getting better but who you would need to spend some money on because other organizations are bidding for them as well, and on the other you have guys who started mma in their mid 30s who are clearly not the cream of the crop of HW talent but who you can get cheap. I've heard from a couple of HWs over the last 2 years or so that they turned down UFC contracts because someone else offered more money and it seems to be getting worse with Reebock now.

Herschel Walker didn't go on some amazing MMA tear...even if he was 20 years younger he wpuldnt have. Lesnar even had a hard time. Then look at Schaub. He did well enough, but he was never top 5-6-7-8.  Most 6'2""+ 240+ lb guys probably grew up playing football and any guys that chose a combat sport like boxing or wrestling mighhht go to MMA. Even then, most of these guys would cut to LHW. HW is always gonna be more dry cuz the general populace doesnt weigh 240 lb while in shape.   Also,I think HW is definitely has more fights that could go either way (TKOs left n right) so most of these guys have lost to each other a lot...there aren't a lot of class 'kings' (guys who would be undefeated for awhile). All the more reason to appreciate Fedor.   Then ads in that these guys can fight longer because they dont cut as much weight and youve got a talent pool that doesnt change much.

The reality is that the hundreds of amazing athletes that would excel at really any sport from a young age will never choose the UFC with the way they treat their fighters. Again, if I am a HS prospect who wrestles, plays football, and play basketball, why would I dedicate the next 8 years of my life training for MMA to make 12,000 dollars a fight. When, even if I get drafted as the lowest paid linemen for one year I will make more money than most fighters make in their entire lives."

Their are many intangibles great athletes all have, dedication, natural ability, handle pressure and adversity.  In high school I wrestled and played football, as did probably 80% of the team. If MMA was a viable option to make good money many of those kids would get into MMA instead of continuing playing football. Right now pay is closer to Major Indoor Lacrosse pay.  UFC has done well creating a new fan base of MMA but they need to look ahead and help encourage the new generation of fighters, not just fans."

These fighters need to look at the examples in the other major sports. NBA and NHL have a 50/50 revenue split between owners and players. NFL I believe is similar.   I'm sure there are some fundamental differences because fighters are independent contractors, not employees of the UFC but it's still in fighters best interest to form a guild/union."

A TKO is when someone else, such as the ref, decides to stop it (ie, he did get up for the 10-count, but the ref thinks he's too out of it to continue.) This is muddled in MMA because there generally isn't a 10-count. Frankly, all TKOs should be treated as KOs in MMA, the distinction is almost pure semantics here."

MMA,3e0a6c,BradBradMaddoxMaddox,4,Tue Jul 21 03:09:13 2015 UTC,I'm having trouble understanding this. A KO is when a fighter cannot defend himself. How is one incapable of defending themselves without losing consciousness?
MMA,3e0a6c,pine_straw,5,Tue Jul 21 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"I think I've seen them classify liver shots as KOs because the fighter is concious, but unable to defend themselves due to reflexively defending their body and leaving their head exposed."
MMA,3e0a6c,funkenspine,7,Tue Jul 21 01:23:39 2015 UTC,"They are dazed and awake but unable to defend. Think of When Gus lost to Rumble. He never lost consciousness as far as I can recall, but he was unable to block further blows."
MMA,3e0a6c,APartOfSomething,11,Tue Jul 21 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"And how is that different from ""has the capacity to defend himself, but he doesn't due to being overwhelmed by the opponent""?   I don't mean to sound snarky, I just don't understand how your examples fit under KO instead of TKO."
MMA,3e0a6c,funkenspine,9,Tue Jul 21 00:51:02 2015 UTC,"I think Big John's point is that only things like Mir/Duffee and Bisping Hendo get logged as KOs, while lots of fights where the guy is conscious but concussed aren't. Gus wasn't unconscious but he wasn't blocking the blows at all. He was just getting punched square in the face with his hands on the mat. The number of times guys are actually out cold is relatively few. Or even Rory vs Robbie, that got booked as a TKO and not a KO. Rory was conscious but clearly concussed, injured and not able to defend himself.  In contrast there are plenty of examples when guys turtle up or don't fight back but are very conscious. Those according to big John are TKOs. Think Faber vs Barao 2. It was a bad stoppage in this case but it got stopped because Herb felt Faber didn't defend himself, not because he couldn't. Lots of times the ref says ""Fight back X or I'll stop it"" and the fight is waved off with the loser very conscious. People rarely tap to strikes but they turtle and don't fight back all the time ...those would be your TKOs."

I guess they should just trend towards the cautious end when handing out medical suspensions."
MMA,3e0a6c,pine_straw,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"It definitely is confusing. I wish Big John gave us a good ""TKO"" example on the show. He did, however, say that TKO is used way too often so a true TKO seems like a fairly rare occurrence. The first fight that came to mind when he described a true TKO was Faber vs Barao II. I do think that that stoppage was too early so it might not be the best example but maybe that's what Herb Dean was thinking when he stopped the fight.   Maybe some true TKO stoppages are when the ref goes ""fight back! fight back!"" and the fighter is covering up. (But obviously, refs say 'fight back!' during true KO finishes too, like Gus/Rumble, so that's not a rule by any means.)  Also, Big John says on the show that in boxing a disabling shot to the body is also ruled a KO so that traditional definition doesn't require lack of consciousness. (but I understand that 'knocked out' usually means 'blacked out'/'passed out' outside of combat sports)"
MMA,3e0a6c,IFeelLikeBasedGod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:13:34 2015 UTC,"I replied to you above, but I'll try to explain again.  You can be ""out on your feet (or in Gus' case, out on your knees).

MMA,3e0a6c,destroytheheart,3,Tue Jul 21 01:22:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure who you're referring to right now, but Gus had no capacity despite being conscious. He could barely move his arms. He made the effort to block the punches but when the last 2 or 3 fight ending punches came (the ones that snapped his head back) there was no effort to block them. KO.   Brock on the other hand could move his arms much more and throughout the whole barrage, yet did not improve his position or block and despite making more of an effort than Gus, still got hit several times. TKO."

MMA,3e0a6c,ndhl83,6,Tue Jul 21 04:28:34 2015 UTC,"I realize that Big John is the guru here, but I'm not sure I can quite agree with him.   when Referee stops the contest (TKO) when an injury as a result of a legal maneuver is sever enough to terminate a bout (TKO) when contestant being rendered unconscious due strikes or kicks (KO) http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#13 I understand that the UFC website isn't the best source but it is all I am willing to look for right now. These name for finishes are somewhat subjective to begin with.  Big John asserts his position, but until we see support for in written in the unified rules or the NSAC don't accept his position for fact.  This post is getting upvoted largely because it contradicts what most people have considered to be the definition of a TKO/KO for a long time.  AFAIK the definition of a TKO isn't written down in a generally accepted MMA ruleset that supports John's claim. ""Capacity to defend"" cannot be measured in a way that can be accurately determined consistently.  This is the biggest reason I believe the definition of a TKO to be left somewhat open.  If it isn't defined anywhere that counters what the common understanding of it is, then we should probably go with how we are currently using it. I would argue that certain medical stoppages (classified as TKOs) such as the AS leg break should never be ruled as a KO.  Something about it just seems counter-intuitive.   I believe Big John is simply misunderstanding what it means to not be able to intelligently defend.  I would argue the only time a fighter cannot intelligently defend themselves is when they actually lose consciousness. Let's take a step back and look at the base term.  KO means ""Knockout."" What does that mean?  Well I'm guessing it means being knocked out of consciousness.  TKO = technical KO.  Technical: of or relating to a particular subject, art, or craft, or its techniques.  The term is used to describe something that isn't quite a knockout, but it is somewhat similar."
MMA,3e0a6c,4Bongin,3,Tue Jul 21 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"I would argue the only time a fighter cannot intelligently defend themselves is when they actually lose consciousness.   You would lose that argument very quickly, with dozens of easily found examples in the last couple years alone. UFC 189: Mendes was completely conscious but unable to intelligently defend himself: Turtling with your hands over your head does not count as intelligent defense and thus the fight was stopped. The Turtle doesn't count as intelligent defense because it does nothing to stop the onslaught or get you in a better position...you are basically waiting to be saved."

MMA,3e0a6c,barafundlebumbler,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"They follow the boxing example with some modifications when it comes to TKO and KO basically. A TKO is a guy covering up on the ropes but taking an unnecessary beating, a KO is a guy drooling on the canvas. But in MMA where you follow to the canvas it is harder to tell so we end up in more TKO's even though the guy was clearly KO'd. This also differs from boxing apparently in that in boxing a TKO is treated as a knockout. So if you're TKO'd you need the same time as if you were KO'd. Where as in MMA you can get knocked the fuck out, little timmy the man slayer continues to pound your face in on the way down and the ref calls it a TKO and you're free to try again in a few weeks. Where as in boxing little timmyt he man slayer beats your ass against the ropes the ref stops, its a TKO but still a KO.  So in my opinion MMA needs to treat it the same way as boxing further and have it where a TKO is treated the same as a KO."

He beat a 45 year old man who is probably 107 years old in fight years given the absolute wars he has been in and how long he has been doing this.  If he loses then he just lost to a 45 year old man who had his first fight in 1997 and competed in the 1992 Olympics. Hendo won the UFC middleweight tournament in 1998.

Also millions of people support Donald Trump, the lesson here is just because millions of people like something, it doesn't mean it's always special or correct. I mean millions of people follow Kim Kardashian on social media, she literally has no value to human beings, yet she's more followed than many of the worlds top scientists who are making life for humans better every day.   My point is I don't think NASCAR is a sport, I'm not trying to trash NASCAR, I'm sure it is extremely difficult to drive at that speed, and of course it's competitive too. But in my mind when I think of a sport, I think of using your physical body, sweating, using your muscles and joints to ahow off your athletic ability. Have you seen some of the NASCAR drivers? They're not really in shape, a few of them have even smoked cigarettes while in mid race lmao.   I understand your point and agree somewhat, but I figured I'd explain myself so NASCAR fans know I'm not trashing them, I iust disagree with it being called a sport, and you are correct as long as advertisers are making millions off of it, they could careless what I think of it. I hope that cleared it up :)"

Losing 13 pounds of water weight (sweating) in a race while doing the equivalent of 800 40-pound reps with your neck (using your muscles and joints) is athletic ability. The guy who smoked cigarettes is an anomaly with a hilarious name (Dick Trickle).  Do you agree football/soccer is a sport? Because this is a video of a footballer being driven around in a race car for 2 or 3 laps. If you don't have time, skip to 3:40 and watch for about ten seconds. Look at him struggle to get out of the car having just been a passenger for a few minutes.  NASCAR, and motorsports in general, takes a tremendous amount of cognitive and athletic ability, and you have to be an ignorant idiot to think otherwise.  If you have any counterpoints, I'd love to hear them. Do you still think it's not a sport?"

But I also don't want to pay $100 for a PPV with one huge headliner and a bunch of people I've never heard of either.   I've seen reports that the UFC gets $20-$25 per PPV buy.  The headliners typically get a percentage of that.  Then after all of the overhead how much money do they have in profit?  I really have no idea.   What about all of the free fights on TV?  How much do they get from Fox?  I wish fighters made more, but are they not getting a fair share of the profits?  I really have no clue.  I don't know how anyone would know."

The fact is particular cutmen get paid, sometimes quite handsomely with flights and accomodation included, for certain abilities and traits they bring to the fights.

MMA,3dzcmi,tehaxor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:29:56 2015 UTC,"Most fighters have no bargaining power. They're one among 500. So, unless you're a top 15 in your weight class, you've got no star power and thus no negotiating table power.  As for a union, it's a good idea, but they're going to have problems presenting a united front as fighters like Conor, or Ronda can negotiate for higher pay already, so it's not to their personal benefit to care. They'd have to risk their high salaries and bonuses on the chance of a union gaining them similarly high payouts (which is probably not going to happen).  So, it's more complex than you might think."
MMA,3dzcmi,stoolsample2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:40:58 2015 UTC,U are right they should continue to let dana fuck them in the ass any time he wants.   Hey they deserve it right they wont stand up to the bully ufc and defend themselves so good on dana for taking advantage of it.
MMA,3dzcmi,GMOcorn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:56:55 2015 UTC,"I really hope that guys start to work collectively. It could start with their gyms. Conor is a good example, because he seems to really understand how important all the members of his gym are to his success. I think he'd be willing to leverage his star power to get his teammates better deals.  Aldo also spoke about how fighters should form a union and how empathizes with a lot of the guys coming up at Nova Uniao   When I speak about this, I don't speak for myself. If I say this might be good for Aldo, yeah, sure it can, I would make good money, I could say that. But when I look at other athletes, like I do at my gym, they need me and Andre Pederneiras to start helping them, because that's a bad thing that they are doing to them. It gets really bad for up and comers or guys who are trying to reach the top.  I'm not talking about me, I'm all right, I'm the champion and I have a high price. Aldo hasn't become the champion now, he has been the champion for years. But for the beginners, it's really bad.   It's really disappointing, because as much as the UFC would like to pretend otherwise, the UFC needs those guys ranked 15-30 in their divisions more than ever. They need to fill so many cards with decent fights. They need to have young up and comers to build into stars and replace the wave of guys who will be retiring.  The UFC is pretty shitty in the way it treats its fighters and I'd love for the situation to change. The UFC has intimidated fighters that keeps almost the entire roster from publicly criticizing the organization or collectively bargaining. I really hope the Reebok deal is the straw that breaks the camel's back and makes fighters realize they need to have a say in these massive decisions."

MMA,3dzcmi,puckfirate,40,Tue Jul 21 04:34:17 2015 UTC,"some of the guys i know are actually nurses. some of them are even doctors. then you got guys like myself, where i've done some training in the army so i felt comfortable doing these kinds of things. so it's a mixed bag really. there's no real 'training'. a few of the more senior cutmen in bellator/ufc/wsof all kind of teach the new kids like myself the little things. there's a few guys that run courses across the world but there really isn't a set standard for cutmen.  edit; just to be clear i'm not some cool guy working the higher circuits. i just work some of the regional amateur cards for fun it's an job that's easy to do, but very easy to fuck up at the same time."

MMA,3dzcmi,JoeLauzonDotCom,20,Mon Jul 20 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"yes and no in my eyes. doctors are there to prevent major injuries from continuing on. we're there to stop/delay major injuries  for example; my buddy mark worked the titan fc card a few months ago. one of the heavyweights had a bad bad cut. so he was treating it, stopping the bleed as best as possible and to try and ""close"" it off (usually done with vaseline, and sometimes a mixture of vaseline and adrenaline). mark ended up stopping the bleed, and the fighter was able to carry on and win if i am not mistaken. ended up with about 15 stitches. it was big. but he could control it, so the ringside doctor allowed it to carry on.  tim kennedy had a fight two or three years ago with major swelling, and stitch was able to keep it from closing around the eye and the doc let him carry on and win that fight.  i've dealt with helping reset broken noses, to treat for a multiple fracture of the ulna (it was a gross break, three breaks in the arm, quite impressive). checking over pre and post fights. i'm there to make them safe essentially.   one thing that makes us stick out, is the hand wrapping. there's guys out there that are just freaking beautys at this. it's definetely an art that takes years to truly grasp how to get it down to an art."

It's gritty, inspiring and followed with great stories from the early days of kickboxing and mma.   Also anything by Sam Sheridan"

MMA,3e2usw,hibscotty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:47 2015 UTC,If you're southpaw Anderson Silvas striking manual has some cool stuff in it.   Randy Coutures Wrestling for Fighting is pretty good as well.
