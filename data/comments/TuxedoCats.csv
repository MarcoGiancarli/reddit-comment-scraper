TuxedoCats,3dtbbj,StateofWA,3,Sun Jul 19 15:11:53 2015 UTC,My cat does this too! I dont get it. And nice name. My parents had a cat with that name a while back.

TuxedoCats,3dr1zs,Pine_Forest_Dweller,3,Sat Jul 18 17:06:52 2015 UTC,So cute.  Almost can't stand it.  :)  Is he all grown up now?
TuxedoCats,3dr1zs,sterlingwriter,3,Sat Jul 18 19:03:38 2015 UTC,He's a little over 3 months old now.

TuxedoCats,3dprec,captainkelso420,3,Sat Jul 18 06:50:44 2015 UTC,He looks just like my Stan. Right down to the I'm going to kill you eyes.
TuxedoCats,3dprec,Dillweed7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:40:34 2015 UTC,Why did he need a bath? I've never bathed a cat and have owned many.
TuxedoCats,3dprec,wheelfoot,3,Sat Jul 18 14:03:29 2015 UTC,He smelled so bad I couldnt even pet him. Hes kind of a gross cat.
TuxedoCats,3dprec,giantnegro,2,Sat Jul 18 16:29:42 2015 UTC,Sometimes I just throw some water on my cat to help motivate him to bathe himself. Mine likes to wallow in dirt.
TuxedoCats,3dprec,melcrawmeow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:00:20 2015 UTC,Mine smells like he wallows in his litterbox sometimes
TuxedoCats,3dprec,rice_pan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:58:47 2015 UTC,They also make cat wipes to use as an alternative to bathing in situations like these. Just wipe the kitty down and he's good to go! Just an fyi :)

TuxedoCats,3dfgz7,meowlookhere,11,Wed Jul 15 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"To my dearest friend.  I stood by your bed last night; I came to have a peep.  I could see that you were crying you found it hard to sleep.  I spoke to you softly as you brushed away a tear,  ""It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here.""  I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea,  You were thinking of the many times, your hands reached down to me.  I was with you at the shops today; your arms were getting sore.  I longed to take your parcels, I wish I could do more.  I was with you at my grave today; you tend it with such care.  I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.  I walked with you towards the house, as you fumbled for your key.  I gently put my paw on you; I smiled and said, ""it's me.""  You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair.  I tried so hard to let you know, that I was standing there.  It's possible for me, to be so near you everyday.  To say to you with certainty, ""I never went away.""   You sat there very quietly, then smiled, I think you knew...  in the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.  The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning  and say ""good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning.""  And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,  I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.  I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.  Be patient, live your journey out...then come home to me.  -Author unknown"
TuxedoCats,3dfgz7,iliketoworkhard,6,Wed Jul 15 22:50:37 2015 UTC,You guys are all awesome. Thank you so much for the positive comments. He was a great cat. Sadly only made it to 6 years old. He wasn't my first lost but definitely my hardest. We had a special bond. His sister misses him a lot though :(
TuxedoCats,3dfgz7,tammyetter,4,Thu Jul 16 01:27:19 2015 UTC,Oh sorry:( such a hard and sad time..I love my tuxedo cats too..hugs to you
TuxedoCats,3dfgz7,maniacmansions,4,Wed Jul 15 22:20:24 2015 UTC,Hugs from me too
TuxedoCats,3dfgz7,sterlingwriter,4,Wed Jul 15 22:25:36 2015 UTC,"Hugs for you... such a beautiful kitty. My thoughts are with you. I went through the same thing years ago, and while the feelings never left, they did fade to a bearable level.  Take care of yourself!"
TuxedoCats,3dfgz7,PeggyOlson225,4,Wed Jul 15 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. It's just like losing a family member , and that's something people who don't have pets don't understand. I always click on these posts and that same onion-cutting ninja follows me in every damn time. Sniff."
TuxedoCats,3dfgz7,drunk8gods,5,Wed Jul 15 23:44:08 2015 UTC,So sorry for your loss.  He looks just like my tuxedo Chairman Meow.  It's never easy and I don't even want to think about the pain you're going through.  Just know he will always appreciate the love you gave him.
TuxedoCats,3dfgz7,cptgonzo,3,Thu Jul 16 01:33:58 2015 UTC,Sorry for your loss.  Classy kittie.
TuxedoCats,3dfgz7,soaringrooster,2,Thu Jul 16 05:18:04 2015 UTC,Sending you a hug and hoping loving memories will bring you peace.

TuxedoCats,3d8oml,StateofWA,3,Tue Jul 14 14:56:53 2015 UTC,That's very true.  I have two.  The girl is kinda moody--I hate to admit probably very much like me sometimes.

Did someone leave their cat in the car at the laundromat?? I've heard of them sneaking in engines so I looked and.. there she was in the rear center of the engine compartment, standing on something. Luckily there was some space there and nothing spinning or hot (yet). I was able to grab her pretty easily.  That was quite shocking."
