residentevil,3e31js,Ryndis,6,Tue Jul 21 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"I actually really like what I've seen so far. In terms of recreating the game visually, it was done very well. The ambiance effects are also done very well and I personally like the darker flash light centric game play. It could use some tuning for sure though. But the lighting effects make up for it, in my opinion.  On the negative sides of things, the combat against zombies looks to be very stale. There are too few of them to be dangerous, they get stunned every shot, and they are entirely too slow with the player being able to move and shoot. Also it doesn't look like location damage will be a factor, which kind of defeats the purpose of a third person aiming shooter. It also ruins a bit of the game play around fighting the G enemies. Oh, there definitely needs to be a way to turn down the music. The ambient effects they added into the game shouldn't be drowned out by super loud game music.  Combat definitely needs to be looked into a bit during the final polish, otherwise the game is really just going to be about exploring an upscaled RE2. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I would like a full new experience though."
residentevil,3e31js,thedude2618,4,Tue Jul 21 17:18:43 2015 UTC,"I'm really not getting my hopes up for this, from what I've seen if they think it's nearly finished it will be a short, lame game.  Because they've reused the assets from Darkside Chronicles there will be many rooms/areas we won't get to see."
residentevil,3e31js,icebear518,7,Tue Jul 21 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"you know what i'm gonna be honest as a person who HATES the gameplay of RE 4,5 and 6 (over the shoulder) this looks really good.... maybe because it brings back the much needed horror.. now if they made the zombies run a little bit faster or just add in the crimson heads this would be perfect, i really disliked the whole melee thing in the newer RE games i just feel maybe make the game like RE reamke and maybe use self defense weapons for only when you get hurt.  i'm kinda surprised capcom has not shut this down yet... maybe they are not planning a RE2 remake yet because if they were this would be shut down fast."

residentevil,3e31js,jorts1114,2,Wed Jul 22 07:35:24 2015 UTC,A fresh take with OTS and texture updates could be cool. It does bug me though that all we have seen of this project is some basic gameplay segments from early in the game. I hope to be surprised when it comes out.
residentevil,3e31js,EventHorizon182,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"Changing the game from the original formula to an over the shoulder shooter without changing an entire set of game mechanics to accommodate the implications an over the shoulder shooter entails such as direct line of sight, increased mobility, precision aiming, ability to examine the environment in 3D, ect. just means you end up with a game that will likely feel ""off"" and will probably have to ride on nostalgia alone.  resident evil 4 ""worked"" despite not really being a horror game because capcom did accommodate for this. The enemies were quicker and more numerous (increased mobility), you could shoot incoming objects out of the air (precision aiming), shoot objects out of trees and secret places to get collectibles (examining the environment in 3d), and shoot enemies with weapons designed for long distance before they get close (direct line of sight).  I like ice cream, and I like hamburgers. But I don't want ground beef served in a cone with sprinkles. This hybrid shit doesn't really work."

residentevil,3e1jhx,relivesa,8,Tue Jul 21 06:22:12 2015 UTC,"I've only found the Eagle worth the trouble which you get the first 2 times you kill him. Keep in mind also that certain events will let you knock him out and make him drop his item without you having to fight and kill him.  The shotgun is super strong in that game, but its recoil is really long. I never had any luck using it against Nemesis. I can kill him the first two time he shows up with just the hand gun though. Just shoot and run in a circle around him. Stay close enough he walks, but far enough away he can't grab you during weapon recoil. He'll eventually get pissed and charge you anyway though, but thats fine. There are plenty of health items in that game.  Alternative, get really good at the dodge mechanic and just laugh at how trivial he is. I have terrible reaction time though, I just can't get the hang of it."
residentevil,3e1jhx,Ryndis,7,Tue Jul 21 06:46:18 2015 UTC,"You really don't need any of the weapons or items that he drops, especially if you've already got what it takes to beat him. Besides the EAGLE, which you get after killing him twice, everything else is just really fun to play with and doesn't serve much practical use given what it takes to earn them. If you could start with those prizes in a new game or something, then they'd be a lot better, but most of the best goodies like the M37 or infinite ammo case you don't get until the game nears its end.  If you just want the two EAGLE parts, then you can get them for free by dropping Nemesis with the live decisions in the restaurant kitchen and the clock tower balcony. If you really want to fight him, then /u/Ryndis has already given you the best advice: use the handgun, stick close to avoid baiting his run, and learn to trigger the dodge move if you haven't already. Beyond that, there are a few places where Nemesis can get hung up on the scenery such as the alley where you first use the lockpick, or behind the bookshelf in the room at the police station where you find Marvin. You can use those to take free pot shots at him until he figures out how to unstick himself.  I almost forgot. You can also mix gunpowders A and B together to make C, which you can then combine with another C to get a CC combination that yields freeze rounds for your grenade launcher. You can also combine Gunpowder C with regular grenades. Freeze grenades are about the most powerful weapon short of the secret unlockables, and Nemesis happens to be extra weak to them. There is no better use in the game for gunpowder."

residentevil,3e1jhx,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:45:24 2015 UTC,"Unlike every other attack, the dodge triggers on zombies if you're caught in the weapon raise animation or immediately after shaking off another grab, so if you equip something like a rocket launcher, the window gets to be gigantic. It also helps to face your back to them if you're using the knife because it makes you take a giant step back, which turns into a giant step forward, and the spin on the auto aim further widens the window."
residentevil,3e1jhx,LexCrunch,3,Wed Jul 22 08:24:22 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time since I've played 3, but I remember the Nemesis being left handed. This means that you should always pass his right side, never try to pass around his left side because he'll grab you. That and just a lot of bullets."
residentevil,3e1jhx,icheissesatch,3,Tue Jul 21 15:40:58 2015 UTC,Freeze/Flame rounds from the granade launcher are the best rounds to use if u want to kill him easily. Freeze = 5 to take down and 5 to kill Flame is 6 rounds to take down 6 to kill
residentevil,3e1jhx,ripperc100jr,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"You could pay attention to Nemesis's attack, since he will only one hand to grab/punch you, it is safer to run towards the other side to avoid his attack. Handgun is the best weapon against Nemesis as the recoil is minimal, it gives you time to run around him and shoot. Other weapons like G.L and shotgun could only make one or two shots before he gets you. Make sure you have enough recovery items with you. Only smash the □/X and D-pad when you were thrown on ground or grabbed since other buttons like R and L doesn't help.   You don't actually need to fight him to get the Eagle handgun, the custom shotgun is fun to use though."

residentevil,3e30ia,xXNuclearTacoXx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"Just play on Normal until you figure out the game. It's a fair difficulty that can still get pretty hard, and the higher difficulties get plain ridiculous and unfair--enough to kill the fun for me sometimes, and I like to think I'm pretty good at it. Enemies can become bullet sponges that need to be counteracted with appropriate skills, which you won't have on the first run through unless you grinded them out in Mercenaries.  You don't earn anything besides achievements for completing higher difficulties. The exception is No Hope, which invisibly doubles the skill points that you earn. You can't wear skills in No Hope, though, so don't bother trying to grind them if you think that's going to help."
residentevil,3e30ia,LexCrunch,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:46 2015 UTC,"No, it's not worth it, I don't think you get anything else other than the achievement/trophy for doing it.

As far as Professional being too difficult, you can always replay it after you beat it once on a lower difficulty and unlock some of the more useful skills.  With Field Medic leveled up, it's really not a big deal playing on pro.  You usually get revived to 4 health blocks when you get downed which makes health items less critical."
residentevil,3e30ia,DrHoenybun,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:14 2015 UTC,"RE6 has a really great gameplay. It just takes some getting used to the camera/gameplay. I loved it, I would do professional only after you played it once through. That way you can better guns / infinite ammo."
residentevil,3e2fu8,Vergil387,3,Tue Jul 21 13:07:14 2015 UTC,"Wesker was first with Umbrella. Once he screwed them over, Wesker took a buttfuck load of data from them and used it for his own purposes while he worked under a company, The Organization, he eventually created. During his leadership for this mysterious organization, he worked for Tricell without their knowing of his secret organization or cartoon-inspired scheme. When Wesker fucked up in RE5, Tricell got bitched out, and had its doors closed. As for The Organization, I don't know who took over or if it has been abandoned.  Too complicated? Umbrella first, The Organization second, Tricell third."

Wesker joined Umbrella's rival company after the mansion incident using the t-Virus, combat data and B.O.W. embryos. He ascended to higher ranks with each virus he stole until eventually he held enough influence within the company to threaten its very existence.   The rival company's top brass then ordered Ada to work against him. Seeing the company as a potential threat, Wesker contacted TRICELL's Excella Gionne and supplied her with the t-Virus, t-Veronica and Umbrella's research data to secure himself a position.  After the Plaga incident in 2004, Wesker took over the rival company. However, he depleted the company's resources in the search for Spencer and led it to ruin. After the Spencer Estate incident in 2006, he went underground by fully moving to TRICELL."

This is Resident Evil we're talking about after all--a game whose characters have an inexplicable viral immunity over half of the time, possess superhuman stamina and vitality, and use magic boxes to teleport their items about the place.  The old RE games have always been really well lit, and even the newer ones that retained the classic style used lighting as an atmospheric effect as opposed to an actual obstacle. I'm not at all against deviations or trying new things, but this game's darkness doesn't look like it's adding any fun, and is in fact shaping up to be quite the irritation.  I am a total pessimist when it comes to this project for several reasons, but of course I hope for the best; and I'll even give it the benefit of the doubt by assuming that the light sources simply haven't yet been added to the game.

residentevil,3dpo0l,tiger66261,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:58:49 2015 UTC,The reason why I'm pessimistic is Capcom is showing no signs of really dropping co-op in favor of a campaign fully designed for singleplayer. Revelations 2's success (which I liked) will probably convince capcom to continue forcing co-op into their campaigns.
residentevil,3dpo0l,Nicholas_,0,Sat Jul 18 18:00:03 2015 UTC,The only redeeming quality of 6 was Ada Wong's ass.  Apart from that the game was absolutely terrible.

residentevil,3dpo0l,Shantotto5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:08:55 2015 UTC,"Fairly pessimistic but I have some hope still.  I loved 4/5 so I wouldn't say I hate the direction the series has been going, but 6 felt like such a complete train wreck of a game to me that I've lost a good amount of faith in them.  It was just so boring.  The combat system was fine but the campaign design was so terrible that it didn't matter.  I'm a little worried they're not going to be able to limit themselves to a single campaign focused on one character again after 6, which is what I'd like to see.  I really didn't like how scattered it was or the style of the missions.  They need to lose the whole action movie vibe as well."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Gondule,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:13:57 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly optimistic. Capcom unlike Konami has recently been showing signs of improvement. I mean look at the recent announced feature of Street Fighter V. Not only are you only going to need 1 disc forever but you can earn all the DLC by just playing the game. That is fantastic.   With Resident Evil 7 I am feeling more open to giving them one last shot. I hated Re6 so much, I enjoyed Re5 but that game was a disappointment to since I loved REmake and Re4 so fucking much. As long as the game doesn't have this big story that is ripped out of a Saturday morning cartoon G.I. Joe bullshit I'll be happy."
residentevil,3dpo0l,CrustyCouch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:48:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm a bit optimistic at the moment. They have heard what the community wants after what they gave us with RE6 (which I enjoyed), and they also made Revelations 2 which brought up my hope factor a bit"
residentevil,3dpo0l,the_user_name,0,Sat Jul 18 16:46:17 2015 UTC,"If Alice was in it, then the game would be action-oriented. Capcom has learned its fans wanted more horror instead of action!- action! - action! And also, I'm sure the fans would be pissed too if Alice was in the game."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Zaeh,0,Sat Jul 18 07:05:07 2015 UTC,"It's a small part of the fanbase that wants horror, and I'm sure Capcom calculates demand based on the sales numbers, instead of what the vocal minority is saying."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Strider_,2,Sat Jul 18 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"im pretty sure the large majority of fans want horror. Probably like 99%. As far as whether it should be action shooting based or old school puzzle style, I think that's where the disagreement comes in. Even then, I still think its a large majority at this point that want a return to form. In that majority tho I think there's debate about whether to keep it true to the old school or to update the controls and inventory etc..."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Zaeh,2,Sat Jul 18 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"Then why are the action games vastly outselling the more horror oriented ones? Action has a much broader appeal, and it's the vast majority that are fine with the new style. It's only a very vocal minority that wants the series to go back to horror."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Strider_,2,Sat Jul 18 17:56:07 2015 UTC,"I think they're outselling because there hasn't been a NEW old school style game in what, 15 years? And when there was it was exclusive to the lowest selling console of that generation (GameCube). And when I say horror i dont mean puzzles and tank controls necessarily (tho I prefer them). RE4 was mostly horror and sold fantastic. Re4 is why re5 and 6 sold so well. You can quote me on that. Also, numbered entries always sell better, and there hasn't been an actual horror game as a main numbered entry since 3, maybe 4 depending on who you ask.  The old school style games have always been console exclusive which divided sales, and 5 and 6 weren't, so that helps. Gaming in general has blown up huge since the ps1/GameCube days as well, that helps. And remember, the REmake is capcoms biggest digital seller ever, and that's a game that was already available on the previous two console generations. That's nothing to scoff at."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Zaeh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:09 2015 UTC,"RE 4 is definitely not mostly horror.  RE 4 was the reason why RE 5 sold initially well, but people knew what they were getting in with subsequent releases and especially with RE 6.  Being available on the PC doesn't triple your sales. Remake HD being Capcom's biggest digital seller ever is completely unsurprising, given that it's a digital exclusive outside of Japan. Even with that, it only sold a million units, which is good only for a remaster.  Remake was available on the Gamecube and the Wii, which basically means that it completely failed to meet its target audience. Most people are buying it for the first time as the remaster, I'd wager. Gaming has blown up but that doesn't compensate for such a huge difference."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Strider_,-4,Sat Jul 18 19:20:30 2015 UTC,"Re4 is mostly horror. You're getting the genre of game mixed with the genre of story. It's a horror action game. Not survival horror, but still. Only the last 1/3rd or less resembled a military shooter. The village and the castle made up the majority of the game and were horror influenced. And people didn't know what they were getting with 6, if you remember, capcom advertised the game (probably every RE since 4 or 5 actually) as a return to the series horror roots. They mostly showed and only demoed a bit of Leons campaign. The only canpaign btw which was horror, and which most people agree is the only part of the game worth playing.   And the fact that you say REmaster sold so well because most never played it, that only goes against your point of horror fans being a minority. It was horror and sold great, and was reviewed great, from (according to you) people with no nostalgic ties to it. And gaming blowing up as enormous as it is, with resident evil having like 6 blockbuster movies come out since RE4 the game came out, absolutely DOES make up that huge difference. Gaming as a culture now vs the GameCube days is exponentially bigger. Insanely way bigger, like, I can't even think of a word to describe its massive growth. Of course that factors in hugely.    All this debating aside, to say that the resident evil fans who want horror are just a vocal minority is just wrong. Maybe survival horror, maybe action horror, over the shoulder, or fixed camera, but Resident Evil Fans want horror in their Resident Evil games."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Zaeh,-1,Sat Jul 18 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, not getting anything mixed up. RE 4 just isn't mostly horror. It's action horror, or half horror at the very best.  Capcom didn't advertise RE 6 as a return to the horror roots of the series. You can't talk for most people in terms of what they thought was the best campaign or the only one worth playing.  It was horror and sold well for a remaster, but the action games sold much, much better. Again, a million units sold as opposed to 6 and almost 7 million.  Yet it doesn't make up for the difference. Gaming blowing up doesn't mean that horror would not be a niche now. There are more people buying the games, but action has the far broader appeal nonetheless.  And that's where you are just flat out wrong. You seem to have some childish true fan mentality about the people who play the series, where you only count people who played the originals and want that kind of gameplay as fans, which is not the case. The huge amount of people who came aboard the series with RE 4 and later games, who want a more action focused experience, are fans just like the rest. In that entire fanbase, the people who want horror back are very much the minority, and are way more vocal than people who enjoy the action games."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Strider_,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"i still disagree with your first half for reasons I already stated. But if i did say ""you win"" that re4 isnt horror, that means that its been almost two whole decades since an actual horror RE game was released. Why would you ask the question why the new ones outsell them? It's been almost 20 years since one was released! As for your second half of assuming I think only horror fans count or whatever, is just totally off base. Im not even gonna bother with that. Last thing I'll say, look at dead space. That game sold really well and was horror. It lost its horror as it lost a lot of its fans. Just a bit of food for thought."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Zaeh,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:08:31 2015 UTC,"It's been ten years since the last survival horror RE was released. The entire series is barely 20 years old.  You're not even gonna bother with it? Fair enough, but I'll then just assume you had no counter argument to it.  Dead Space wasn't any more horror than RE 4, it had an emphasis on action as well. Even more so with the sequel, that was clearly marketed as a more action focused game than the original, and still sold the same amount in its first week than the first game did overall.  The series lost a lot of fans due to EA running it to the ground and people getting basically bored with it. Comparable due to the lukewarm reception to the later survival horror REs due to Capcom doing the same things over and over again."
residentevil,3dpo0l,tiger66261,0,Sat Jul 18 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"It's a small part of the fanbase that wants horror,    Says who? Correlation doesn't necessarily equal causation; something Capcom failed to grasp. The last main RE game which did really well in sales expectations was RE5, and if you notice their marketing campaign for it, it's heavily based of genuine survival horror that looked difficult and scary. The main game didn't live up to the marketing campaign, but it showed people were looking for survival horror.  RE6's marketing was much more action oriented, and the sales were well below the expectations."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Zaeh,0,Sat Jul 18 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"The games not being able to live up to Capcom's unrealistic expectations doesn't mean that they didn't sell really well. RE 6 didn't meet Capcom's expectations, but is their third best selling game of all time, nonetheless."
residentevil,3dpo0l,tiger66261,0,Sat Jul 18 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"You need to apply budget to sales. If a 100 million movie makes only 100 million, that's pretty bad. If a 10 million movie makes 30, that's damn good.  I don't know the budget of RE6 but Capcom gave their all to RE6's marketing campaign and production values, so doing well in sales on paper is a given. Then you start factoring lots of things - like how Capcom pretty much diverted almost all their manpower to creating this huge beast of a game, and you notice it was a major blow to Capcom's financial situation."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Ryndis,2,Sat Jul 18 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"You don't need to apply budget sales. You only need to apply sales. How much money it made is irrelevant.  If 7 million people buy game A, and 5 million people buy game B, game A is more in demand. How much money the two made does not matter. You're debating demand, not profit."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Zaeh,0,Mon Jul 20 12:52:29 2015 UTC,"We're not talking about how much profit the games made after production costs, we're talking about how much demand there is for the games and how many units they sold."
residentevil,3dpo0l,tiger66261,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:23:38 2015 UTC,"You're not getting my point. Look at it this way. RE6's sales was not a demonstration not of how much fans want action, but the byproduct of a heavy marketing campaign for an extremely high-budget project. Give the same level of attention to an RE game that relies heavily on horror instead of action, it'll pretty much sell just as well if not better."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Zaeh,0,Sat Jul 18 19:50:23 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense at all, really.  It was marketed as an action game, people saw the action game and wanted to buy it."
residentevil,3dpo0l,tiger66261,0,Sat Jul 18 20:03:14 2015 UTC,"Well okay, lets just drop the previous conversation since you say it doesn't make any sense without explaining why. If I argue on your grounds for a second -  RE5 is Capcoms best selling game ever; and the game was heavily marketed as a difficult, scary survival horror based on trailers, interviews, gameplay videos and the like.  So I guess you could say people saw the horror game and wanted to buy it; even more so than RE6."
residentevil,3dpo0l,Zaeh,0,Sat Jul 18 20:11:41 2015 UTC,"RE 5 wasn't marketed as a scary survival horror game at all, it was marketed basically marketed as another RE 4, just on a bigger scale and with faster pace."

residentevil,3dqojj,Ryndis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:30:18 2015 UTC,"Thats pretty much the idea yea. Traditionally you'd think of boss battles as a more mechanically (usually in the form of combat) difficult encounter than with standard enemies. But in a game that really was not designed to be about combat I feel they could have designed the bosses in a less ""just here to waste your resources"" way. Like where bullets might stun or slow down a boss but to actually kill it you have to use some overly complicated set of mechanics specific to the boss room kind of deal.  Like the spider for example could have been more along the lines of trying to avoid him while running through a webbed maze you have have to clear with your knife and in order to kill the spider you crush him with one of those boulders you release with the crank that you learned how to do from your experience 10 minutes earlier in the area. Even a simple boss fight mechanic could have turned that game from a 9.5 to a 10."

In RE0 we see Birkin and Wesker talking about leaving Umbrella together. Wesker says the time is now, Birkin refuses because he wants to stay behind to finish his G-Virus project. Shortly afterward in RE Wesker fakes his own death during the Spencer Incident and joins the ""organization"" that they were both going to defect to.   In RE2 we see Umbrella come for the G-Virus and ""kill"" Birkin; Ada arrives to steal G, ostensibly working for some other rival organization.   In RE3 we see the dead U.S. Special Forces guys in the dead factory. In an interview with production staff (and later confirmed in the SpecOps mission in Operation Raccoon City) it's revealed that these U.S. soldiers were sent to retrieve the Birkin family and the G-Virus - but Umbrella got there first, and then lured the U.S. soldiers to an ambush at the dead factory where several Tyrants were dropped in.   Through this we may surmise that Birkin and Wesker were going to defect to the U.S. government - as it was U.S. military who came into Raccoon City to try to save Birkin and get the G-Virus before Umbrella got their first and inadvertently started the outbreak.   In RE: CVX, Wesker (now working for his new ""organization"") and colleagues, using military gear, execute a devastating air attack on Rock Fort Island.   In RE4 we see Ada obviously in cahoots with Wesker, confirming that Ada works for the same organization that Wesker defected to, and that Birkin also planned on joining.   Summation:   Birkin was planning to defect to the U.S. government but never got to. Wesker defected to the U.S. government. Ada is a U.S. agent, probably CIA. The group who attacked Rock Fort Island (""HCF"") were U.S. military.  this is all messed up by the introduction of TriCell in 5, of course. But it was a fun theory til the series began to suck."

residentevil,3dorme,LexCrunch,2,Sat Jul 18 01:01:19 2015 UTC,"Nobody explaining it here is going to help you to understand why it's so awesome. You need to play it to understand why it's such a fan favorite. You can play it with an emulator on the PC, and as of recently, people have began setting up multiplayer servers so you can do that too! There's some info on what to do here. http://obsrv.org/"
residentevil,3dorme,Hoodawink,2,Sat Jul 18 01:23:03 2015 UTC,"It's one of the last older style RE games (fixed camera angles, etc.)  They did some interesting things with the old RE system too. Each character has their own unique traits and special items, many locked doors can actually be broken open with enough force, you can defend yourself unarmed, and Outbreak 2 actually allowed moving and shooting.   There is a ton of replayability to them too   Both games had 4 endings per character. Nearly half the endings in Outbreak 1 were unique. The ones that do kinda repeat at least have different dialogue depending on which character you're playing as. Multiple difficulty settings per level with various twists (e.g. completely different enemies depending on difficulty, completely different paths etc.) as well as unique interactions depending on the character you were playing. Online takes it further by having a random item/weapon loadout; that handgun you picked up the last time you played the level could be a knife or a first aid spray now, even if it's the same difficulty. Every character has alternate costumes as well as multiple NPC skins (each with their own starting items and different stats). Many scenarios offer alternate paths to complete the level (in harder difficulties you generally need to complete all paths. Online, you usually pre plan how you'd split the team and who goes for which key item).   Unfortunately, the load times were pretty annoying unless you had the older PS2 with the HDD installed. It also had a bit of online lag and unreliable in-game communication. It was a little ahead of its time in that sense."

Things like a very limited inventory, slow zombies, Fine/Caution/Danger, tank controls etc.  The next game after the Outbreak series was RE4, and from that game onwards, we never really revisited the original style of game except with re-releases and remasters."

residentevil,3dgyea,RightKnight002,10,Thu Jul 16 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"RE5 basically ruined game trailers for me. Especially since it came out close to MGS4. Both games I followed closely as they were being developed and MGS4 was everything I hoped for, where RE5 was a huge disappointment for me.  It's clear after playing the game so many times that the tone of the game was meant to be different from its predecessors. It's really hard to categorize Video Games now a days because they're so DIFFERENT. When you're making a horror game, there are different types of fear you want to play off of. RECV and its predecessors were all about tension and release. RE5 looked to be more about thrill and suspense. Unfortunately, I don't think that mark was really met.  As you see in the early trailers, Chris is just getting swarmed by enemies. I think the main feeling they wanted to convey is kind of a hopeless and endless feeling. Everytime you killed a Majini, 2 more show up. This kind of emotion is really present in the very first level of the game, but after that it falls flat heavily. For really a lack of a better way of describing it, I had so many butt clenching moments the first few times I played the first level. Scavenging ammo was tense because there was almost always an enemy right behind you. It seemed like the point of all of the weapons wasn't to kill all the enemies, but to slow them down to escape and delay getting overwhelmed. The melee mechanic played a huge roll in this because a good head shot gave you the breathing room needed to get away. The first level of RE5 is probably one of my favorite experiences in a game I've ever had.  Unfortunately, somewhere in its development, the mechanics to the game changed drastically. All of the Majini slow down tremendously from what they are like in the trailer. I got so tired of watching Majini RUN AT ME FULL FORCE SPRINTING FAST AS FUCK. STOP!, back up 2 steps, and then come at me. What happened to the Majini that charges Chris's torso and holds him? Or the ducking ability for enemies that charge slash you. They're all gone. The game just slowed down mechanically, and the amount of enemies were cut down to like 1/10. After the first level the game devolved tremendously.  One of the design goals I think was to create a game where scavenging resources and fighting were a conjoined entity. Which compliments RE5's inventory system tremendously. Unfortunately again, outside of the first level, this aspect devolves as well. Instead of Looting and fighting at the same time, you fight first and loot after when its safe.  As a final point, they were also supposed to have this unique lighting system in the game where your vision shifts when going from Light to Dark places and vice versa. Again, in the trailer, you see Chris with dimmed vision indoors fighting an assload of enemies. Unfortunately, this mechanic is basically only used in 1-2 when you enter the tunnel with the dogs.  I honestly think 5's original direction would've been a good evolution had it been fully realized. However, this is mostly just my speculation from the few things I've read and the old trailers."
residentevil,3dgyea,ChaoticMortality,4,Thu Jul 16 07:52:06 2015 UTC,"This actually helped me realize something that was weird for years. I got a copy of the Japanese demo way back before RE5 was released and LOVED it. The main takeaway that I had from it was the game wasn't scary, but it was really intense and never let up.  Then the game came out, and I still loved it when playing coop with a friend. But it never had that same intensity, and I couldn't place the reason why. You're right though, it's the first level that was in the demo disc that had a totally different pacing from the rest of the game."

The trademark title does concern me honestly, because when you say ""Umbrella Corps"" I instantly think of the USS from Operation Raccoon City. (And that game was a cheesy kind of suck).

residentevil,3df9zw,SteampunkMrFoster,6,Thu Jul 16 02:46:44 2015 UTC,"Like with reading Fanfiction, watching Comic Movies, or any conversion from one artistic medium to another, the problem isnt that they're separate things. The problem is that people generally don't like to see the characters not be true to who they really are. The Walking Dead TV series has great original characters as well as holding true to the characterization of the Graphic Novel. Barring certain examples like Andrea, who is received well in the Graphic Novel and generally poorly in the TV series. One of the major selling point for A Song of Ice and Fire readers when it comes to the Game of Thrones HBO series is that the cast of characters are overall done flawlessly. Those actors capture the essence of the original character phenomenally which helps people enjoy the series more.  That's probably why the first movie is generally received decently. It feels like an original story in the RE world. Nothing wrong with that. The problem started when they shoehorn in iconic characters poorly. Claire, Chris, Carlos are good examples of poorly casted characters. They should've just been original guys. Jill was done very well though. And I actually really like the guy they have playing Wesker. The fight between Chris/Claire and Wesker was god awful though.  That being said, I would've really liked the third movie personally if the Tyrant at the end just never talked. I hate nonsense babbling human turned monster antagonists."

In your original comment, you said one thing even though you apparently meant something else that wasn't quite the same thing. I'm just saying that you should say what you mean (Most original fans don't like the movies) instead of hyperbole (It's impossible for original fans to like the movies), because otherwise, needless situations like this one can arise."

They are adaptations of the games by the director. It doesn't take anything away from the games!   Would I have liked to see more faithful adaptations? Certainly! But I still think they are super fun movies. The later ones are a little lame, it's like watching people cosplay as Chris/Claire/Leon etc and it's just kinda corny."

residentevil,3diejm,SilentBobVG,-2,Sat Jul 18 14:15:51 2015 UTC,"Well, think about this. Brad Vickers, the person you see Nemesis kill first, knew that Nemesis was hunting for the S.T.A.R.S members. That means that Nemesis killed somebody before him. All other S.T.A.R.S members are accounted for . . . except for Rebecca. She was also listed as Alive in the Resident Evil 2 archive, but Deceased in Resident Evil 3 Archive. That death would have happened riiiiight before Brad died . . . coincidence?  The whole theory can be found here - http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/835623-resident-evil-revelations-2/71373844  Nemesis is definitely Rebecca Chambers."
residentevil,3diejm,chofortu,6,Thu Jul 16 16:05:04 2015 UTC,"I don't like this whole shoehorning main characters to be Nemesis. The link you posted was even busted in the comments right below it, so it can't be Rebecca either.  Nemesis came from taking one of the base Tyrants and infecting them with an advanced parasite that gave it enhanced intelligence.   It wasn't a main character, it wasn't someone with weapon/fighting experience, it was just a random test subject turned Tyrant. That's it. No need to dig any deeper than that."
residentevil,3diejm,News_Bot,3,Thu Jul 16 17:07:58 2015 UTC,"Brad could also have surmised this from the fact that Nemesis keeps saying ""S.T.A.R.S.!"" and trying to kill him  Also if Nemesis killed Rebecca, how can it be Rebecca"
residentevil,3diejm,FreakLikeChewy,3,Thu Jul 16 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"Brad knew Nemesis-T was hunting S.T.A.R.S. because... it happened to be chasing him, and happened to constantly yell ""Stars!""  Rebecca's listed as alive in Archives. She is only listed as dead in the English release, because it's a stupid mistake.  Rebecca was never mentioned or appeared in BIO3 because her story during Raccoon City was meant to be covered in BIO0, but they ended up making it a straight prequel."

residentevil,3diejm,MikeKnowsGames,3,Thu Jul 16 16:31:19 2015 UTC,"Nemesis-T is nobody. It is based on a mass-produced T-103, making it a clone. The T-103 itself is already an enhanced clone of the T-002, which was merely a random male prisoner with strength and a good immune system.  Kevin was not involved with S.T.A.R.S. He failed the selection test twice and never got into the unit. The jacket he wears is a reinforced model issued to select R.P.D. officers, including Leon S. Kennedy, due to the rising ""crime"" (people being eaten) in the city.  I'm not even going to entertain that ludicrous Rebecca theory."

residentevil,3dczas,LexCrunch,6,Wed Jul 15 08:23:58 2015 UTC,"I don't get that either. Not using your melee attack removes a whole layer of the game play. And who WOULDN'T want to pummel faces in as Chris or smack bitches around as Jake?    Now I admit I am a filthy casual, and no good at games half of the time, so I struggle with getting the timings right. But still. At least I try.  It also makes Mercenaries incredibly fun.."
residentevil,3dczas,tafferling,2,Wed Jul 15 08:53:23 2015 UTC,It really does. I still prefer 5 over 6 just because of the inventory-reloads while punching assholes in the face. It's a very glorious thing.
residentevil,3dczas,REsoleSurvivor1000,5,Wed Jul 15 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily agree with it, but comparing RE6 to CoD doesn't mean ""every single aspect of RE6 is found in CoD"". The mêlée attacks are different, but the comparison is presumably levelled at the over-the-top action set pieces, and the fact that the enemy often returns fire (in a series where the enemy is usually zombies or w/e)  I'm with you on the hand-to-hand though. Particularly in RE6 - the challenge of mastering the system makes it satisfying to use effectively, I think"
residentevil,3dczas,chofortu,3,Wed Jul 15 10:23:20 2015 UTC,"I never understood the complaint with 6 of giving the enemies ranged weapons. Why is that suddenly not okay even though 4 and 5 did it first?  Besides, if every single enemy just wanted to duke it out with you, then it would be too easy. I know they mostly do that in 4 and 5, but 6 gives you way more freedom of movement by comparison for that to work out."
residentevil,3dczas,chofortu,2,Wed Jul 15 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"The difference is that 6 makes it feel like a warzone. It is a warzone, in fact - and the enemies' ranged weapons aren't just crossbows or whatever, they're fully automatic rifles. The ganados from 4 are still kind of zombie-like - I couldn't imagine those guys rolling around with machine guns like the bad guys in 6.  Anyway, you might not agree with those who say it's a bad thing, but surely you can agree that it's different!"
residentevil,3dczas,chofortu,2,Thu Jul 16 00:23:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely. The thing is that of all the reviews I read (several), none of them ever bothered to mention a legitimate reason as to why that was a bad thing in any way. Just that it was different and it was being held against the game.  I mean, the miniboss character in 4 carried around a giant chaingun like the Heavy from Team Fortress, and he had clones that came back for #5 which also featured majini that would shoot at you with AKs. It's not as though it came out of nowhere."
residentevil,3dczas,ZacZero,2,Thu Jul 16 00:32:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, forgot about the JJs. I guess it was just the warzone thing then - the beginning of Chris's campaign did start with a very CoDdy sequence of pushing back the enemy, driving tanks and armoured vehicles and so on.  As for why it's a bad thing, I suppose you could argue that it's a bit derivative."
residentevil,3dczas,deathday,3,Thu Jul 16 00:36:40 2015 UTC,"You don't have to look too far ( http://issuu.com/gtsurgeons/docs/resident_evil_6_advanced_controls_guide_ !) to find really killer gameplay advice on using the finer points of RE6's control system (specifically: headshot to melee attack vs light stun, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jSNHqfy_W0 ) to conduct what is essentially a ballet of slaughter in Mercenaries mode (Or scenes like the Cathedral courtyard in the Leon Campaign).  But Capcom kinds screwed the pooch by failing to highlight the finer points of RE6's combat mechanics. Plenty of people have no idea how to use sliding, rolls, counters, etc effectively.  Pity; its the strongest aspect of the gameplay."
residentevil,3dczas,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Wed Jul 15 11:31:01 2015 UTC,I didn't know any of this stuff. Wow... I played through the whole game co-op with a friend and we never knew these advanced controls.
residentevil,3dczas,Ryndis,2,Wed Jul 15 18:59:39 2015 UTC,"Most of those actions are covered in the official instruction manual.  I would have personally preferred they throw you right into the game to make you read the book instead of having that stupid half-assed tutorial prologue section that no doubt gave everyone bad first impressions, especially if they're on a lower end PC and can't comfortably change the graphics settings until after it's over."
residentevil,3dczas,RamBo-ZamBo,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"It took me some time to learn about these on my own, but I'm glad I did. Lots of the quick-shooting and sliding into people just to set up Coup De Gras are just plain awesome. Always forget about the sprint attack myself though."
residentevil,3dczas,REsoleSurvivor1000,3,Wed Jul 15 22:20:55 2015 UTC,"The reason why I love the new RE's control system is because it puts the player more in control of their actions. The melee system is just a perfect example of it.  RE's old scheme allowed veteran players to exploit enemies to a silly degree where it didn't really feel rewarding. In REmake, I don't feel particularly skilled following Yawn around in the Library hugging his ass and knifing him to death without fear of injury. Mechanically, the enemy can't do anything about that. RE4 and then on really rewards the player for mastering its combat system.  Mind you, I'm comparing Apples to Oranges. The old RE system fit the old RE playstyle very will with its limitations. It complimented its atmosphere instead of its combat, whereas the new generations controls compliments its combat instead of its atmosphere."
residentevil,3dczas,REsoleSurvivor1000,3,Wed Jul 15 12:01:04 2015 UTC,"I like to aim for the knee in RE4 to trigger the suplex. That move is really awesome, especially when it crits and the head busts."
residentevil,3dczas,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:46:39 2015 UTC,Down-the-stairs suplexes have to be some of my favorite things from RE4... Besides the up-the-stairs suplexes anyways. Both are equally amazing.
residentevil,3dczas,EQUASHNZRKUL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:12:19 2015 UTC,I still have no idea why Leon refuses to suplex the village ganados even though everyone else is fair game. Maybe he thinks they're all too grody looking to be touching them like that.
residentevil,3dczas,Gerd_das_Pferd,2,Wed Jul 15 23:23:15 2015 UTC,I guess we all know Leon's preferences now: Robed and pale as fuck.  Holdin' a Mátalo party dropping it like it's hot! Leon's a freeeeeeeeeeak!
residentevil,3dczas,Mekbop,3,Thu Jul 16 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"By that logic, Leon also has a thing for military men.  Actually, that makes perfect sense. He and Krauser were totally into each other."

residentevil,3dczas,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:13:26 2015 UTC,"RE6's K&M controls are garbage. You can change them, thankfully, but even when they're all bound to your liking, it's kind of a struggle. It doesn't help that by default there are tons of worthless shortcut keys for very simple actions, which serves no purpose other than to further complicate things unnecessarily."
residentevil,3dczas,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Wed Jul 15 15:15:59 2015 UTC,"I really loved it in RE4. Even though it isn't a real zombie game anymore, it still had the right feeling - if there's only one, I can take it out easily in the way described above. Shoot the face, hit it hard. But if there's loads of them, things get complicated. That's how it's supposed to be."
residentevil,3dczas,mypunkrock,2,Wed Jul 15 15:32:30 2015 UTC,I always like to shoot the lead one in the face to knock the whole group down with Leon's kick. I didn't think it was all that complicated.

I might have been playing RE6 wrong because I seem to remember hammering the melee button.  RE5 is my second favorite in the entire series after the original. I love the melee system. The stomp is so satisfying. I think Dead Space based their whole system around the RE5 headstomp. I also love the NG+ aspect of RE4/5 but now that I think about it, once you get a weapon that's too powerful like a maxed out magnum you have no use for the melee system. That's kind of a bummer."

I know most of you want a remake, I like that too, but this would be fine for me."

residentevil,3denxs,ripperc100jr,2,Wed Jul 15 18:26:10 2015 UTC,They look terrible. It's so much better to emulate RE 1-3 and up the resolution to 1440x1080.

residentevil,3denxs,Zaeh,0,Wed Jul 15 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"Not at all. They come with a filter that makes the game look a little bit better.  And the only way they can up the resolution to 1440x1080 would be to make every single scenario again, considering they are pre-rendered. It's not going to happen."
residentevil,3denxs,ripperc100jr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:34:56 2015 UTC,I can play it at 1440x1080 right now with ePSXe. Now I realize that doesn't make the backgrounds look any better because they're at a fixed quality but the polygons look way better and you can apply antialiasing to it to keep it from getting too pixel-y.   I didn't know about the filter on PSN. I assumed it was a straight port.
residentevil,3d8ncn,ARJared,3,Tue Jul 14 10:47:23 2015 UTC,"Have not played any game newer than RE 4, but there were certainly times in that game that evoked the claustrophobic feel of the earlier titles (5-3, in the ruins fighting Krauser comes to mind immediately).  That said, I immensely disliked some of the new introductions to RE4, including instant deaths and receiving instructions on how to shake off enemies.  Honestly, there are a handful big improvements that would make improve the series for me. First, it was explored in the Outbreak titles and dropped after, but the use of improvised combat weapons would be fantastic. Pipes, bricks, etc. should be fair game. And they should be able to be made by the player, which leads me to point two.  I truly wish characters could more easily engage scenery. In RE4, you could break open doors and windows, albeit infrequently. I love that, and wish more could be done with it.   Third, a physics engine that adapts to weight. One of the troublesome aspects of the series has always been that you had limited space to carry things, but shotguns and grenade launchers took up as much space as herbs and keys. In RE4, the attache case was fairly unique and an improvement on previous systems. In something akin to more survival horror, I'd like players being able to carry only so much weight. Want to carry guns galore? You'll be slow as hell and have difficulties avoiding enemies.   Skill systems and familiarity points with weapons would also be cool. I know the former were in Operation Raccoon City, but would add another level to the game."
residentevil,3d8ncn,mypunkrock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:18:18 2015 UTC,"I can't argue with any of these points. I think a next gen RE with these inclusions would be crazy fun. Also, I liked RE4, I just would have preferred it being named something else, since it didn't have anything to do with RE."
residentevil,3d8ncn,LexCrunch,4,Wed Jul 15 06:49:14 2015 UTC,"I can sympathize with your wanting the old style to come back, but it always bugs me when anyone faults the new games for not really trying to be scary as though they've somehow failed their objective. They're action games through and through, and really good ones at that."
residentevil,3d8ncn,LexCrunch,4,Tue Jul 14 13:59:37 2015 UTC,"Some are really good, that's for sure. I fucking loved RE4, but I would have loved it just as much, if it was called something else. It had nothing to do with the rest of the series, so why not make it, a stand alone title? The newer action oriented games should have been their own series, since they are so radically different. I would even be happy if there was a sub series that was third person, and the main series could retain that survival horror style."
residentevil,3d8ncn,LexCrunch,3,Tue Jul 14 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"I definitely wouldn't mind RE doing its old thing again, especially since nearly every horror game made today is the exact opposite of fun despite being so ubiquitous. To have it come back and show those kids who's boss would be awesome, but to mark down the new ones simply for not being like the old instead of at least trying to in some capacity accept their evolution seems kinda silly to me.  It tried something new in a gradual transition to resemble something closer to what was popular at the time, and did an excellent job while staying fresh and unique. It worked, too; they sold really well. Since horror games have been making a resurgence lately, and with the stellar sales of the HD REmake and hype for RE0 HD, I think it's a safe bet to expect something closer to the classics in the foreseeable future.  Either way, I'm totally okay with it."
residentevil,3d8ncn,deathday,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"If we keep getting awesome entries like Revelations (part 1) and the remake, I would be fine with Capcom continuing the new style, as well."

They're fun, but the campaigns are seriously lacking, and while the raid mode in 1 was really good, I think it worked a lot better as a time sink for a portable device. That said, it's really depressing that Revs2 doesn't yet have a portable platform on which to be played, especially since its raid mode is super duper shallow."

residentevil,3dd5o0,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:28:14 2015 UTC,"Reboot the gameplay, keep the story.  Although considering the success of the action oriented games, it just needs to be toned back from RE6, not rebooted entirely."

residentevil,3dd5o0,Zaeh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:12:37 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't they? Having a more toned down horror gameplay doesn't mean that you need to purge the entire story for that. Most of the modern games have been standalone stories that don't affect each other.

residentevil,3d6vem,News_Bot,8,Tue Jul 14 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"Umbrella Chronicles explains how the company fell. It was a mixture of being banned in the U.S., being attacked by a rival company and the U.S. military (and others), plummeting sales and their revitalization projects (T-A.L.O.S. and the Spencer Rain auction) being foiled.  Mikami just wanted to get it out of the way in 4's opening and condensed it down to ""stocks fell"", which is true, but it's literally just the first stepping stone."
residentevil,3d6vem,News_Bot,3,Tue Jul 14 04:07:09 2015 UTC,I'm always hearing about the superbestfriendcast talk about Umbrella Chronicles and Darkside Chronicles but I've never played them. I wonder if I should. Seems like a lot of important RE plot was revealed.
residentevil,3d6vem,chan_jkh,3,Tue Jul 14 13:06:09 2015 UTC,"A fair amount of plot, yes. UC ties together and wraps up 0-3 quite well. DC is relatively minor in comparison, only Operation Javier offers anything new to the story."
residentevil,3d6vem,Metro343,2,Tue Jul 14 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"Ehhh... If you already have a Wii or a Playstation Move controller it's one thing... They're fun games, but I wouldn't consider them ""must-plays"" (especially if you only have a PS controller or something. Rail shooters suck with just a controller).  Pretty much half of Umbrella Chronicles can be ignored (the retellings are non-canon and a good chunk of the files are just directly taken from the older games).   Darkside Chronicles looks great visually and might scratch that ""revisit RE2 itch"", but like News_Bot says, it barely offers anything (unless you really cared about how Leon and Krauser knew each other...

residentevil,3d6vem,lskennedy,2,Wed Jul 15 04:18:12 2015 UTC,"Umbrella ""Corps"" makes it sound like an ORC sequel. However, people should be aware just how many games this series has-- nearly 20 on mobile alone."

residentevil,3d6vem,KevinLee487,4,Tue Jul 14 01:09:10 2015 UTC,I don't know. Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition was an excellent move and the 3 characters they added are all awesome. Granted Trish is basically just a mish mash of Dante and Vergil's abilities.
residentevil,3d6vem,HaouLeo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:57:50 2015 UTC,"Cost is a huge factor too, $25 for a game is a bargain value, especially from a AAA publisher. People are more prone to spend on what they know over some indie title."
residentevil,3d6vem,stratcaster,3,Tue Jul 14 04:38:43 2015 UTC,"This is true. To be fair, they didn't really do a whole lot. They slightly tightened up the graphics and added 3 characters who were largely already existing anyway. They pretty much just had to make a few new character models and then piece Lady, Trish and Vergil's movesets together from existing material.  I'm a HUGE DMC fan (Vergil is my all time favorite character), but I wouldn't have been able to swallow it had they charged more than $40"

residentevil,3d6vem,EQUASHNZRKUL,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:40:26 2015 UTC,They'll probably stick with something a little bit more low-key this time. Hopefully. It's what seems to work with the franchise.
residentevil,3d6vem,Zaeh,0,Tue Jul 14 03:21:35 2015 UTC,"Although RE 6's sales were about six times more excellent than Remake's, so I wouldn't count on them straying too far off that path."
residentevil,3d6vem,EQUASHNZRKUL,2,Tue Jul 14 02:29:12 2015 UTC,I think RE6's excellent sales have more to do with the franchise piggybacking on RE4 and RE5's success. If they put out another game like RE6 I think the sales will drop off a cliff.
residentevil,3d6vem,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"It isn't piggybacking on RE 4's success anymore, no. That could be argued for RE 5, but not for RE 6 anymore."

residentevil,3d6vem,EQUASHNZRKUL,0,Tue Jul 14 12:06:52 2015 UTC,"Except that no, it's not riding off the success of RE 4. It's riding off the success of the Resident Evil series and name as a whole.

residentevil,3d6vem,Kaizien,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:26:21 2015 UTC,Explain the 6 million dumb fuckers who bought the game then.
residentevil,3d6vem,Zaeh,2,Tue Jul 14 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"The childish differentiation between ""true fans"" and ""not true fans"" is completely subjective to you.  Capcom never said that, they said that Leon's campaign will be a bit more like the older games. Not to mention that I think it was someone from Capcom Unity's PR team who said that, not Capcom themselves.  I know this is going to be a really hard concept for you to grasp, but a lot of people actually like something you don't, that being the more action oriented RE games. Action has a much broader appeal than horror today, and considering the older games' obsolete design, it's no wonder that the action-oriented games are heavily outselling the horror ones."
residentevil,3d6vem,lskennedy,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:32:40 2015 UTC,What the fuck do true fans have anything to do with the 6 million sales...
residentevil,3d6vem,basedjesusOG,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:43:18 2015 UTC,They didn't even make a half of their predicted sales though... REmake blew RE6 out of Capcom's waters. They didn't fathom REmake's success. Most digitally sold game on PSN AND Capcom's history?

It breaking records for digital sales is only logical, given its a digital exclusive out of Japan. Yet, best selling digital title doesn't still compare to the best selling, and third best, games of Capcom."
residentevil,3d64s3,ghost_on_the_net,3,Mon Jul 13 20:42:42 2015 UTC,Code Veronica. I prefer the Wii version of 4 and I'm pretty sure Outbreak is basically impotent without online support.

RE4 is great too, obviously, although the Gamecube/Wii/PC versions are superior to the PS2 one. Outbreak series is fantastic too, although less fun now that the servers are offline (unless you play on PC)."
residentevil,3d64s3,SilentBobVG,3,Mon Jul 13 22:44:30 2015 UTC,Seriously? I friggin' LOVED Resident Evil 4 on my PS2. Granted there are better versions of it in HD but it's still a solid play. If you don't get it for PS2 you should at least try and pick up an HD version. The game is still damn good don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Even if it's different than the games of old it is still worth looking into.  Code Veronica is a pretty great game as well. Not one of my favorites but it reminded me of Outbreak somewhat as I have played that one beforehand. And speaking of:  Outbreak: Wasn't too fond of the first one. I got confused in the hospital level and dropped it years ago. Been meaning to go back and give it a try but who knows when that'll be. File #2 however is a seriously great game by itself. Despite the lack of online multiplayer there is still LAN options (that is your only real option in terms of multiplayer anyways) but even the single player finds a way to work. Now of course sometimes the AI is terribly awful at keeping up with you and/or being smart but even with that said I still like the game.
residentevil,3d64s3,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Mon Jul 13 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"Outbreak is underrated. A fun game regarding what happened in Raccoon City (also, zombie elephant is epic). Code Veronica is cool and a good game in between the style of classic Resi and the one in recent Resident Evil games. Resi 4 is a great game, overrated when people say its the best in the series, but is pretty cool. If you want something more classic, pick Code Veronica. If not, pick RE4"

residentevil,3d64s3,themikesem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:05:48 2015 UTC,It's the consensus between the fans. Resident Evil 4 is a classic for people who don't love the franchise as much as we do (and that's ok. not bashing anyone).
residentevil,3d64s3,themikesem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:24:57 2015 UTC,I've played every game in the series except the gameboy and GBA games and I think 4 is objectively superior to Code Veronica.

RE: Code Veronica played just like the old Resident Evil games so I'll say it had great gameplay... but the graphics are awful. They decided to go 3D with it and the technology wasn't there yet. Whereas RE4 totally changed the gameplay so the fans may be divided (not the critics though--they loved it) but the graphics hold up today.

I'm totes okay with you taking first place. That score is beastly shit that shouldn't go unnoticed. You earned it."

residentevil,3d2ny7,ktabino,31,Mon Jul 13 01:10:27 2015 UTC,I would prefer the classic camera views. It should match REmake as close as possible.
residentevil,3d2ny7,biclighterburns,15,Mon Jul 13 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"This. The issue comes with the claustrophobia of RE2's environments. The police station, the sewers, the lab -- it's all very confined and, as such, it's more appropriate to have the traditional, less precise control style of RE, RE2, etc. Because RE4 has much more open environments, the thrill comes from having the ability to precisely choose a specific location on a specific target as it attacks you from a full 360 degrees.  Unless they completely redesign the environments of Raccoon City -- a major mistake -- the over the shoulder aiming of RE4 will provide too much precision for the limited number of zombies that can be funneled into a precinct hallway or a laboratory doorway.   RE2 is a survival horror game, not a survival action game. The setting should be more tense, more confined, with less maneuverability and fewer weapons. If Capcom remakes it in the vein of RE4, it's losing the heart of the original. I like RE4 for the changes it offered, but my nostalgia for the original games exists for what they offered; I want a prettier version of the game that already exists, not a remodeling based on a different game that already exists.  Edit: that's not to say there can't be changes; the REmake did a fantastic job with this. I just want it to embody the overall structure and spirit of the original. Update it graphically and atmospherically, but mechanically it should be more or less the same. This is also how I feel about the Final Fantasy VII remake -- make it look better and add little bits of content to help expand it, but make it play the same with battle screens and materia and everything I'm familiar with. If I want FFXIII or RE4 mechanics, I can play those games, but I can't get FFVII or RE2 with current generation graphics, textures, frame rates, audio, etc., and that's the purpose or a remake.  Edit: a word."
residentevil,3d2ny7,asinyne,-1,Mon Jul 13 06:03:34 2015 UTC,"The same exact reasoning could be used for why they should do something different.  If you want the same type of gameplay as the original, then you can just play the original.  That's not the purpose of a remake, that's the purpose of a remaster. Remake improves upon all aspects of a game, not just graphics."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:35:23 2015 UTC,"Well if you look at the original GameCube Resident Evil -- a game they called a remake -- it was largely the same game. Graphics were upgrades, environments were slightly altered, but for the most part they kept it the way it was.   My reading is that people want a remake of Resident Evil 2, not Resident Evil 4 reskinned as Resident Evil 2."
residentevil,3d2ny7,asinyne,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:01:29 2015 UTC,"The Remake was actually three fourths new, as Mikami famously put it. That said, the game was made relatively shortly after the original, only 5 years after or so, which means that not much was in need of changing. It's an entirely different thing now."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Zaeh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:03:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why it's a remake and not a remaster. They took the skeleton of the original and rebuilt it, but the mechanics were the same, the plot was the same, the overall length of the game, plot progression, atmosphere, etc... All the same. The fact that the REmake was release only 5 years after the original doesn't mean much to me -- they just re-released it and it sold amazingly well, telling us that people were more than willing to play that game despite its fixed cameras, tank controls, etc. Besides, The games have been in the decline since 5, so action horror isn't working so well for them.  My opinion is that I want them to do to RE2 what they did to RE. The second game is not only set in a city, it's set indoors, and that means rooms and hallways. If Leon has a half dozen slow moving zombies shambling towards him and they're all funneled into a straight line by the width of the hallway, plus they can be specifically shot in the head, it's going to ruin the tension. That stuff works in RE4 because the Ganados are faster, can sidestep, can use weapons, and can come at you from all sides, so the ability to aim your shots is mitigated by the fact that you have to aim shots all around you, including at a distance as well as platforms, roofs, etc.  With RE2, because it's in a city, they can expand on the game by adding news buildings to explore, new creatures to fight, etc., but if they don't do slow moving zombies in Raccoon City, in the police station, in the sewers, in the labs, then they're not doing the same game."
residentevil,3d2ny7,asinyne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:21:04 2015 UTC,"The fact that it was released only 5 years after the original makes all the difference.  Action horror seems to be working for them just fine. RE 5 is their best selling game ever, with RE 6 being the third one and close to overtaking the second place."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Zaeh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:27:44 2015 UTC,"Why does it make all the difference? The REmake that was just re-released sold really well and was pretty much universally loved. I played through it multiple times, despite having played the original on PSX and the remake on GC, and I still loved it, it still holds up. It's still considered one of the best games in the series.  RE5 was a follow up to one of the best games in the series so people were really excited to get back in. It sold well, but it wasn't that doesn't mean it was good (it wasn't bad, but it was definitely a decline). Same with RE6 -- everyone I know hated that game. I've been talking about a remake as if they were following the 4 template, but if they tried to remake RE2 in the vein of 5 or 6 I'd say they'd really be missing the mark -- that action and aesthetics was ridiculous (they've started to feel like the last couple of Resident Evil movies, and those definitely prove that the amount of money a product makes doesn't mean it's good).   I think the fact that people are talking/asking about an RE2 remake so soon after the HD remake's release is indicative that it got people thinking ""what if they did this to the second game?"" I don't think many people came out of 5 or 6 saying ""gee, I'd love to replay an RE2 in that style."""
residentevil,3d2ny7,asinyne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:44:07 2015 UTC,"Because a 20 year difference is an entirely different thing in the industry, as opposed to 5 years. The remaster of Remake sold well for what it was, although obsolete game design choices were very vocally pointed out in it.  There's a whole a lot of people who like the new games, more so than who like the old ones. Making a full remake of the second game as a horror title isn't just something that's really that viable anymore."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Zaeh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:54:02 2015 UTC,"How do you know there are more people who like the new games than the old ones? That might be true about 4, but every time I talk to someone about it or see a ranking, the top games are the REmake, 2 and 4.  And if people do want action Resident Evil, then Capcom can make RE7. RE2 should get the same treatment as RE, any new games can continue the action style. The first games, the games with slow moving zombies, were about tension and horror. It doesn't make sense for the RE2 to speed up.  They'd not only have to change the mechanics of the game, they'd have to retcon the story. As a fan of RE2, I want to play that game in higher definition. I want to feel the kind of fear that game produced with graphics that make me believe it.  Besides, OTS doesn't work in tight confines because the camera needs the room to maneuver without getting stuck in a wall."
residentevil,3d2ny7,asinyne,8,Sat Jul 18 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you got one of the higher votes, because the amount of people who'd prefer OTS or just don't care I honestly kinda find fucking baffling. Like just please, let the people who enjoy the classics have that. Don't fuck it up for us guys, you already have all the newer games."
residentevil,3d2ny7,ShadowLeggy,7,Mon Jul 13 09:10:06 2015 UTC,Fuuuuuck no. Why don't they understand that the camera angles were the scariest part? I can't tell you how many times I've went around a corner blind and regretted it!
residentevil,3d2ny7,JaySilver,16,Mon Jul 13 10:09:18 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that all remakes should be made with the option to play OTS or classic style camera, that way fans have a choice to experience it either or both ways."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Geedle,6,Mon Jul 13 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"If there's a remake of Resident Evil 2, I'd like it to be in the style of the Gamecube remakes like Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0.  They have the same graphical feel of Resident Evil 4, but play like the original games."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Rockman82,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"i guess Capcom is understanding that that is what the majority of fans want, bringing REmake and Zero to the PS4 instead of RE5/6 Remaster."
residentevil,3d2ny7,HaouLeo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"Majority of the fans is just not right. It's a vocal minority of the fanbase, which wants the survival horror back."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Zaeh,2,Tue Jul 14 00:38:38 2015 UTC,"I suppose it could be a vocal minority, but it is an INCREDIBLY loud vocal minority if this is the case. Everywhere I go it's always people complaining that they want the older games back.  Granted I love me some classic RE too, but I'm one of those people that appreciates both sides of the action-horror cheesecake. Really hope that Capcom finds a balance in their future releases."
residentevil,3d2ny7,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:16 2015 UTC,"Despite being more vocal, it's still the minority and horror is the niche. No matter how vocal they are, that won't still translate to more sales.  Although I'm sure that Capcom measures demand based on sales from the get go, instead of how vocal a part of the fanbase is."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Zaeh,2,Wed Jul 15 23:08:02 2015 UTC,"Of course. It's just that I've seen so many people complain about it that I don't believe it's a minority anymore. It's like the Need for Speed fanbase. People say it's a minority in these cases but the ""minority"" is damn near everywhere preaching what they want to preach."
residentevil,3d2ny7,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:26:30 2015 UTC,"Because they are the most vocal, yeah. That's how the concept of the vocal minority works. For every person complaining online how they want the horror back, there's ten guys who were okay with the action games and would buy the next one, without feeling the need to voice themselves either way."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:35:03 2015 UTC,Fair point. As I mentioned above I'm hoping that Capcom finds that balance to appease the two genres. Either all in one game or in separate releases I'd be okay with either.
residentevil,3d2ny7,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"I can't really argue with you because I have no proof, but I'd bet most fans enjoy the classics a lot more than the latest call-of-duty-ish games."
residentevil,3d2ny7,HaouLeo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:24:58 2015 UTC,And the fans of the series is a much broader term than just people who played the originals and want that style back. I know of multiple fans that have never played any game before RE 4.
residentevil,3d2ny7,Zaeh,4,Tue Jul 14 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"As for the question, yes I would play it. But, it would lose some of the horror, IMO. What people forget is, back when j-survival horror was at its peak, clumsy controls and limited field of view actually lent to a lot of the dread we remember. Having ots grants you a lot more insight to what's coming and gives far easier aiming and shooting.   Like I said, I would play it, but rather have a straight faithful remake like RE1 had so many years ago."
residentevil,3d2ny7,caughtupincrossfire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:40:13 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, after playing RE5 again, either I was just rusty from not playing it for a while those controls sucked and felt really clunky as well. Of course not nearly as tanky as the originals and remakes but I would still get tense when the chainsaw guy was chasing me.  If I recall you actually had to stop completely to turn corners or else you would run into the wall.  So I still think it can be scary running away from lickers and such."
residentevil,3d2ny7,colgato,3,Mon Jul 13 07:08:23 2015 UTC,"I cant stand that style at all, classic camera angles i'll take any day"
residentevil,3d2ny7,xTye,4,Mon Jul 13 12:51:58 2015 UTC,"Nope. That would be a disgrace to RE2.  If they remake it, I literally just want updated graphics. Not like with the first game by adding new items like a fuel canister that is needed often."
residentevil,3d2ny7,mypunkrock,8,Mon Jul 13 13:08:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, as long as it doesn't have the cut scenes for every door, staircase, elevator, and portal. That stuff is now super tedious."

Honestly I wish The Evil Within would have been a RE spinoff or something because I think it would go down as one of my favorite in the RE series.
residentevil,3d2ny7,xcurtmightyx,6,Tue Jul 14 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"Probably not.  A proper remake would not be made for that.  RE2, like 1, 3, code Veronica were puzzle games, needed 3rd person camera angles."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Ryndis,9,Mon Jul 13 01:31:58 2015 UTC,"Probably not a popular answer around here, but honestly, I'd prefer it that way. I love me some Resident Evil, but the old games are a little dated to me. I can't enjoy them like I used to. I'd love a fresh, OTS experience to a game I used to love and play thoroughly."
residentevil,3d2ny7,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:12:29 2015 UTC,"No way man I'm with you. It's why I'm happy they're revamping the combat system in the FF7 remake. I don't want to play a remodeled, upscaled, recreation of the original. I want a new 2015+ experience of the same game.  Though I do hope they take notes on how well REmake did its lighting. I don't think I've played a horror game with better use of lighting than REmake. That part in the Kenneth Hallway where the zombie is just down the hall hanging out in the shadows and will come after you after a lightning strike illuminates the hallway, just perfect attention to detail. Immersion like that is genius i hope makes it to any new RE game."
residentevil,3d2ny7,icebear518,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:20:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely this. Haven't played too much of REmake, but the parts I did managed to grab my attention all the while feeling like a fresh experience. Of course this could be because I didn't play the Gamecube version of RE but I feel it did a really wonderful job in this aspect.  Also FF7 Remake hype. I'm right there with ya."
residentevil,3d2ny7,Sissle,3,Wed Jul 15 22:59:40 2015 UTC,"that's a huge negative, but that is because i really disliked RE4-6 just hated everything about them."
residentevil,3d2ny7,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Mon Jul 13 11:37:43 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I would LOVE both. Press the select button (or whatever your console's equivalent is) to switch back and fourth between classic and OTS, like going back and fourth between graphics in Halo Anniversary. The game can totally be played completely in either style, but switching could create interesting gameplay mechanics, like OTS for more precise aiming, but classic is better for puzzle solving and exploring. Much like classic and retarded controls for REmake HD, giving us a choice might actually improve the experience all around."

residentevil,3d35pq,EQUASHNZRKUL,3,Mon Jul 13 03:46:38 2015 UTC,"The SourceNext PC version is close enough to a remaster for me. Better textures, resolutions, all features available from the start, and best of all skippable doors. I wouldn't have minded a slightly higher resolution and skippable cutscenes, though.  I'd rather see a full on re-imagined remake similar to the first one. I'd personally prefer it to play similar to the original games, though. Wasn't a fan of a lot of the things they did with the first remake, as much as I liked it."

residentevil,3d35pq,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:27:52 2015 UTC,"It was a modernization done in 2007 of the PC version, made to be compatible with modern machines. It's not a big improvement or anything, it's just the definitive version of the game. It has every feature from every version available as soon as you boot it up except for the blood color and 2D controls from the N64 version. You can even choose between playing the original Biohazard 2, or play on Arrange which is exactly the same as the harder US version, complete with Nightmare Mode. I especially like this because the Game Over screen is censored in the JP version, but not in Arrange Mode.  It's only in Japanese, but if you have the original English PC release, then there's a patch floating around that you can use to merge some of the English files with the SourceNext version for English text."
residentevil,3d35pq,Zaeh,2,Mon Jul 13 05:57:03 2015 UTC,"There is no point in remastering or ""re-texturing"" the original game, the remake is the only option here."

residentevil,3d35pq,Sissle,-8,Mon Jul 13 04:01:07 2015 UTC,"... I don't think you know what a remaster is... You know the backgrounds would no longer be blurry, right? That's the whole fucking point of a remaster? To unblurry the blurry."
residentevil,3d35pq,Zaeh,7,Mon Jul 13 04:30:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think YOU understand how a remaster works. The original artwork is blurry to begin with, and was never designed to be seen at a higher resolution. REmake got lucky with how high quality the backgrounds already were, but RE2 has incredibly muddy backgrounds, and the original artwork looks more or less the same, if Capcom still even has high enough resolution versions to use. They would essentially have to completely re-do not only all of the backgrounds, but probably all of the item pictures as well, which is a bit more than a remaster. Plus, the character models would still look like legos, just really CLEAR legos. Half the models in RE2 literally just have separated cylinders for limbs. It would be a colossal amount of effort, possibly just as much as just remaking the game from scratch, to re-do the visuals to look good enough. How many PS1 era ""remasters"" can you even think of that aren't just straight up remakes? There's a reason."
residentevil,3d35pq,Sissle,-2,Mon Jul 13 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"Halo? Hitman? They completely recoded the entire game in both cases. All that was left the same were some sound files, the maps, and the gameplay."

residentevil,3d1yjk,DM_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"I like the skill system of REV2 a lot, though it unfortunately lends itself to making the game waaay to easy with a few overpowered skills (I'm looking at you, 3 shot rocket launcher). I don't mind that there are stages form RE6 in the game but it does speak to the lack of new content in REV2 that so few stages are from the REV2."

The enemies change (Attributes) and get varying levels of BS to put up with, but aside from that it's the same.  The only exception is the Omega level, which is just the final boss fight from the campaign.  At this point I've 5-emblemed everything except for the god damn protect some stupid thing stages."

One REV1 level is on the beach for the giant RE events, but there are no enemies or things to do...except shoot the giant.  The other one you have to pay for it. I don't think I'm missing anything else.  But having ghost ship back, with Norman of course (and he better be more of a challenge to battle than infected Neil, infected Alex, and infected Pedro), would be awesome. Or going through the whole REV2 eps. 1-4 campaign."

residentevil,3ctnvk,Darkohuntr,9,Fri Jul 10 18:07:19 2015 UTC,Underworld is by far my favorite. If you played the games it brilliantly ties together how in Code Veronica  Claire can randomly email Leon her coordinates even though the last time they were supposed to see each other was racoon city.

residentevil,3ctnvk,RogueEmbers,6,Fri Jul 10 18:43:21 2015 UTC,Haha I totally agree! That's why I love how S.D. Perry kind of tries to fill all the little plot holes left after RE2
residentevil,3ctnvk,The_Naked_Snake,7,Fri Jul 10 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"I think S.D. Perry does an amazing job of translating the games to novels. She breathes more character into the characters, she gives more background on things in the games, and even adds in a bit of her own which only benefits them IMO.    Her two original novels aren't as solid in my opinion but they are interesting. And to her credit, I like her overall idea for continuing RE much better than the route Capcom took. SD Perry had Leon join up with the remaining STARS to secretly fight Umbrella. She builds new relationships between them and has them find new allies along the way. Several books later she still had plenty of directions to take that.    Capcom on the other hand made Leon a spy, never touched on Rebecca again, did away with Umbrella and wasted tons of potentially good plot in the 5 minute prologue of Resident Evil 4.    So props to SD Perry, and I'd say it is well worth reading the rest."
residentevil,3ctnvk,T_Snake451,4,Sat Jul 11 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"The ones that are adaptations of the games are a really fun read, and overall pretty faithful to the source material.   Book 1.

residentevil,3ctnvk,thisprofilenolongere,3,Fri Jul 10 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"You've gotten through the only bad book, Caliban Cove lol.  The rest are good.  Underworld (#4) is another of her original stories so it's a little out there, but it's still decent as far as I can recall.  They don't get as good as her first and third books, but are still all worth a read."
residentevil,3ctnvk,thatoneguy721,3,Fri Jul 10 18:15:34 2015 UTC,"I've read the first and third multiple times, they were great and true to the classic games.  Caliban Cove was just way to out there for me, the whole set-up screamed bad fan-fiction. It was okay but not good."

residentevil,3ctnvk,FamilyGlue,3,Fri Jul 10 21:51:59 2015 UTC,Caliban Cove is my favorite.  Underworld is worth reading.
residentevil,3ctnvk,LexCrunch,2,Fri Jul 10 23:05:45 2015 UTC,I was expecting the spin off books with no relation to the games to be a glorified fanficiton but SD Perry really did a great a job with crafting a new adventure.
residentevil,3ctnvk,Republican_Atheist,3,Sat Jul 11 06:26:20 2015 UTC,I've always wanted to read the books. Happy to see some people who enjoyed them.
residentevil,3ctnvk,Nigmus,2,Sat Jul 11 01:35:12 2015 UTC,"They're entertaining fanfictions. If you enjoyed the author's works, the rest are pretty similar, so you'd probably also enjoy those. A few of the books are her own non-canon stories, so if you decide to read those, keep in mind that they're still just fanfiction."

residentevil,3ctnvk,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:04:11 2015 UTC,Is she writing more??
residentevil,3ctqnn,LexCrunch,6,Fri Jul 10 18:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the writing has transitioned from ""funny because it's so bad"" to ""not funny because it's so bad"" and back again, a few times. Some people find Leon's dialogue amusing in RE4, but that's almost certainly an accident. I had a few genuine laughs in Rev2 I guess. But there's never been anything actually emotionally engaging, or any character whose identity or backstory was developed beyond the cliché that inspired them. It's not necessarily a failing of the series - it's always been RE's MO, to channel the corniness in a way that's, at the very least, entertaining. Part of it is probably a necessary artefact of making an ostensibly ""American"" game with a Japanese team. Picking a favourite character is always going to be difficult when they feel like strange facsimiles of one culture as perceived by another.  That said, I like HUNK because he's sexy"
residentevil,3ctqnn,chofortu,4,Fri Jul 10 18:39:47 2015 UTC,"Part of RE's appeal for me was that it felt intentionally corny with ham and cheese to varying degrees since the beginning. I get a lot of flak for that, though, like thinking that somehow invalidates any merits the series has."
residentevil,3ctqnn,Ryndis,5,Sat Jul 11 00:31:49 2015 UTC,People want the game to be superserious but criticize 5 and 6's characterization. Chris gets a shitload of flak because hes so superserious and contrasts favorites like Barry/Leon.
residentevil,3ctqnn,cheez124,6,Sat Jul 11 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"my 2 favorite characters are chris and jill. sure, they're not exactly deep characters, but i find them likable enough and a little more believable than someone like jake or RE4 leon with their constant wisecracking.   i found jill to be especially likable in RE5. revelations ruined her in every way imo. she never showed any emotion and she looked/sounded completely different."
residentevil,3ctqnn,cheez124,5,Fri Jul 10 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"Revelations was especially lacking in the personality department. I guess that's why they tried to ham it up with Quint and Keith. It's a very controversial opinion, but I liked those guys."
residentevil,3ctqnn,tafferling,4,Sat Jul 11 00:29:51 2015 UTC,"yeah, those guys...wasn't a big fan lol. i did like parker, though  as much as people call chris and jill bland characters, there's really a world of difference between re5 chris and jill and revelations chris and jill."

residentevil,3ctqnn,SilentBobVG,6,Sat Jul 11 10:16:53 2015 UTC,"Jill is one of my favorite video game characters ever, but it's certainly not because she's well-written. It's because I shared an unforgettable experience with her. REmake was my first Resident Evil and Jill was the character I beat it with. The feelings of dread and isolation were fierce. She was basically my only companionship on that long, dark night in the mansion. She shared my frustrations and my eventual triumph.   I think this is the same reason a lot of classic gaming characters are so well-loved. Even though Link doesn't have any personality, he's the player's companion throughout the experience."
residentevil,3ctqnn,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Jul 11 10:35:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I like any main character now, the writing of the newer games have completely ruined any love I had for them growing up. As much as I love RE4, 5 and 6, they completely ruined the main characters. Turning them from relatable everyday underdogs, to insanely over the top caricatures with flat and bland personalities.   Saying that, Claire has probably always been my favourite and I'm glad they haven't ruined her because she's been off the radar of the main series."
residentevil,3ctqnn,iPickled,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:26:55 2015 UTC,I'm of the opinion that Revs2 completely ruined what character Claire had. She was just a face and a name in that game.
residentevil,3ctqnn,REsoleSurvivor1000,3,Fri Jul 10 21:11:55 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, but I don't think that ruined her character at all. Even if it's definitely not my favorite rendition of her character.   I was just glad they didn't make her a super hero that could do back flips and over the top fighting moves"
residentevil,3ctqnn,SilentBobVG,2,Fri Jul 10 21:16:27 2015 UTC,Personally I don't think she gets enough screen time in the series. So much potential to not be a Jill-clone it hurts but Rev 2 never acts on giving her much personality.
residentevil,3ctqnn,zzzAlexHzzz,2,Sat Jul 11 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"They decided to give all the personality to Moira. Everyone else was left in the dust. Natalia was okay, I guess.

residentevil,3ctqnn,REAPERD117,2,Sun Jul 12 15:41:53 2015 UTC,My favorites are Leon RE2 version  Because he is naive doesn't understand what happen  and he is  a rookie and Rebecca Because she also is a rookie and was never trained to fight zombies and monster.  Latest RE game characters are too good at what they do they  are not even scared by the monsters its has become all in a days work . It is in fact time to reboot the series or add a new characters  i would like one which as almost not military training and  never experienced the BOW horror so we can have a blank state.
residentevil,3ctqnn,Darkohuntr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:47:16 2015 UTC,That would be pretty cool as long as it doesn't mean that future games in the series have you playing a character who can't even shoot a gun properly.  RE doesn't need to turn into a crappy indie horror game where all you can do is run and hide from everything because you have no weapons and will die instantly.
residentevil,3ctqnn,158458,2,Sat Jul 11 03:12:43 2015 UTC,I agree with  you i just don't want a hero who does back-flip and  beat monster in hand to hand combat RE6 leon i am looking at you. I simply want a guys who meet zombies and monster for the first time.  Like every RE hero did before.  Jake was a bad choice because it has  Wesker power.  Moira in Revelation 2  if we were playing her alone and if she could use  firearms would have been perfect.  and Barry would eventually come to save her.
residentevil,3ctqnn,Shera89,2,Sat Jul 11 03:18:24 2015 UTC,"I think if I had to choose between the whole ""Chris or Leon"" scenario I'd have to go with Leon. Mostly because to me at least he feels like the character who would have a more believable character progression path. In RE2 he starts off as a naive rookie cop (even with the given ""he's got talent"" excuse) who has to fight to survive on his first day of the job! Progresses to RE4 where he seems to have hardened up slightly over the years and still maintains to keep his cheesy jokes and positive outlook. Unfortunately RE6 doesn't do him much service since the humor isn't as much of his character as the previous game, but he still manages to keep my choice of preferred character.  Now don't get me wrong I like Chris too, but it's the big question between these two when they are compared together. As for my favorite character well that's easily Wesker. Dude's a super-badass that can't be denied unless your name is either Chris or convenient plot device.  EDIT: JUST A MOMENT! I found another favorite character. His puns are very powerful. Especially against living things! You know the man. The one, and only Barry sandwich-serving bad ass of course!"
residentevil,3ctqnn,iPickled,2,Sat Jul 11 23:22:24 2015 UTC,For me they dont need to always be the badass or with the smart mouth but they have to also he smart and learn not to go on missions alone like some characters cough cough* (Leon) so far chris redfield has fit the bill plus he was there when it first started
residentevil,3ctqnn,bruce22n,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"I really don't think Capcom tried hard to develop their characters, even with the story-line they did badly after RE2. My favorite has always been Leon though, he's just always been appealing to me.   I really want a re-boot, in fact I'm craving for it. The entire series is amazing, but could of honestly been so much better. It's a shame a once iconic horror series has been made into what it is today."

Are you counting the same guy as multiple people?  More people in that thread asked for Rebecca back than Jill. Personally, I don't mind either way. Jill is my favourite character because she was there at the start- and Nemesis is one of my fondest memories of my childhood.

residentevil,3cqwrh,LexCrunch,3,Fri Jul 10 03:42:58 2015 UTC,No I don't believe it's possible to play the prototype as it was designed for the Nintendo 64 DD which was never released (edit) in America. I guess it was released in Japan so maybe it will be possible to play that prototype one day.
residentevil,3cqwrh,deathday,2,Fri Jul 10 16:34:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that's right. I always forget the DD existed.  I know it would never happen, but if a playable prototype version was included in some capacity as a bonus feature in RE0 HD, that would be pretty damn swell."
residentevil,3cqwrh,LexCrunch,2,Fri Jul 10 17:48:21 2015 UTC,I read a little more about it and I guess they saw the poor sales of the 64DD and changed it to a regular N64 game. Then they realized the game wouldn't fit on one cartridge so they delayed it until the GameCube was released. I'm not sure if the footage they're showing is the 64DD or N64. Also it seems like footage of the prototype is very rare so this may actually be the best look we've ever gotten of the early build.

Maybe i am totally wrong but they might have showed us this because its a unlock-able feature.  Play Resident evil 2 now on a PS1 on PS3 the game is blurry and not fluid  and pixelated.  Look at  the prototype Its clean fluid almost like it was meant to be in the remaster and playable. I have my finger crossed. I hope they put it in.

residentevil,3cqedb,showbread98,2,Thu Jul 9 23:26:52 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree. It was revolutionary to the franchise and was probably one of the best features in that game in particular.

residentevil,3cqedb,T_Snake451,3,Thu Jul 9 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"It's the best in the series.  It's a lot of fun just to organize things according to your needs/obsessions.  I was really disappointed when RE5 came out and it wasn't included, but with the game being co-op I understand why it wasn't an option."
residentevil,3cqedb,scarletdevil_,2,Thu Jul 9 23:17:16 2015 UTC,I'll have to agree with this. Micromanaging your inventory and playing puzzle just to fit that one exta item you picked up is incredibly satisfying. Having it more streamlimed like RE6 always made me feel like I was being held back but RE4 made it feel like it was always my fault. It's great.

residentevil,3cqedb,HobbieK,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"The inventory system was the epitome of perfection. Addressing a major critique of the previous installments' inventories, the RE4 system is a great example of how perfect RE4 was. Unfortunately, after Capcom began to implement co-op every chance it could, like a newborn mother posting photos of her baby on Facebook, the pausing system was no more. However, if they implemented the RE4 system but you could equip more than one gun at once, that you could swap pre-selected weapons with the push of a button, they could easily bypass the multiplayer barrier, similar to Borderlands 2's inventory system. When playing co-op, opening ones inventory to swap one of the four equipped guns with one in the 39 other slots doesn't pause the game. Mayhem ensues as you frantically attempt to replace your pistol  with the rocket launcher you just picked up"

Worst of all was if I died after tidying up the case, resetting all that progress. I ended up traveling light just to avoid having to manage the inventory.  RE5's inventory got it so right. Nine slots with all one-slot items, quick item switching, brief management, inventory reloads, and most importantly, no pausing. Really helps the pace and tension of the game."
residentevil,3cqedb,LexCrunch,3,Fri Jul 10 00:21:01 2015 UTC,"I hate how every time someone posts an opinion that doesn't align with the hive mind here it gets downvoted.  Both systems in 4 and 5 were fine and worked well in their respective games.  I found 6's system to be a tad annoying, but it worked well enough.  I did like the herb/pill system they put in place.  It made healing on the move easier, which is necessary in that game."
residentevil,3cqedb,JoeKrauzer,3,Fri Jul 10 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"I've heard some nasty general complaints about 6's inventory, but I never understood what the big problem was. You could manage it while moving or attacking, which was done really well. The only issue I had with it was that it's a linear menu, so it can take a while to cycle to the item in the back."
residentevil,3cqedb,LexCrunch,2,Fri Jul 10 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"Dont worry man, I agree with you on this. RE4's inventory was super tedious. The game was linear and had breaks in action all the time due to general enemy placement being in waves. The inventory system just helped kill the tension build up in the game because you'd disappear for a mini-game for random periods of time.  And it wasnt even much of a mini-game after a bit. You just followed pretty standard patterns that you figure out in the beginning of the game and it became super easy.  Lastly, it didnt add anything. Inventory management was harder in all of its predecessors and 5. It was just an arbitrary time sink and disconnect from the real game."
residentevil,3cqedb,Ryndis,0,Sat Jul 11 04:13:01 2015 UTC,"did we play the same game? you're acting like you spent days in that menu.  between battles.

residentevil,3cqedb,Ryndis,-1,Mon Jul 13 04:06:54 2015 UTC,"9 slots so 4 weapons plus ammo fills up 8 slots already.  That's smart.   The item exchange game once you're full was realllly fun.  Inventory reloads! Sooo good for tension and pacing.   In Resi 4, if you ran out of shotgun ammo midbattle, shit got tense fast.  You had to switch to some other weapon or were forced to run.  Resi 5 though?  Don't worry about it! Just use the Y X left X cheat code and you're all good! You can reload whenever you want too, while meleeing an enemy, while opening a box, while going up a ladder, whenever you like."
residentevil,3cqedb,MarcusQuintus,4,Sun Jul 12 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"You don't need a slot for ammo on each of your weapons at all times, and you certainly don't need to be lugging around four weapons. That's just a bad idea. Don't get mad at it just because you and your partner were carrying around too many valuable things that you weren't willing to drop.  It's the lack of pausing that adds to the tension. Both the inventory reloading and no pause is what helps the pacing by keeping you in the fight and giving you something to do while watching character animations. You call it a cheat, but it was just as surely put there on purpose as the exact same trick in every RE game before it, save for #4. I didn't even mention the other neat trick where you swap weapons while aiming to shoot big weapons faster.  Your sarcasm is really cute, by the way."
residentevil,3cqedb,LexCrunch,-1,Sun Jul 12 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"Pistol for general use, Sniper for long range, Magnum for strong enemies, shotgun for crowd control.  Even if you get rid of the sniper, that still leaves just three spots for other stuff.  If you don't have ammo, what are you going to be shooting?  What difficulty have you played the game in?  You can reload any weapon in Resi 5 in the time it takes to press three to five buttons.  Absolutely no tension in that.  All the games before 4 weren't combat focused. Pacing =/= tension.  If going into a menu for less than three seconds kills pacing for you, I don't know what to say.  Play CoD I guess.  No menu whatsoever in those games, you just press a button.  It's the internet.  If you're not really obvious about it people will take you seriously."
residentevil,3cqedb,MarcusQuintus,3,Sun Jul 12 21:10:03 2015 UTC,"I've finished the game on all of the difficulties several times. If you have a large enough magazine on your weapon or you don't really plan on using it much, you can carry a good chunk of ammo in the gun and reload it with any stray ammo pickups whenever they come up. I would recommend ditching at least one, but preferably two weapons, and skipping on carrying ammo for your third weapon if you have one. Maybe use melee attacks more and swap out your pistol for a machine gun. They serve pretty much the same purpose, but an MG has the largest ammo stack.  You do more than just reload your weapons with the inventory. There's still the sorting and keeping track of space and item quantity and value, which is important if you want to be able to pick up items during a fight, which you'll want to do sometimes to turn invincible for an incoming attack. It's its own brand of tension, just like RE4 has its own that you mentioned. I personally prefer what RE5 has to offer because of how much faster it is.  Action games or not, the games before still had fights, some of which were mandatory. You were still using an inlaid trick to bypass a mechanical obstacle.  Swapping weapons in RE4 isn't a big deal, really. It's the massive amount of time that can be spent organizing the case and making room for items when you're full that bothers me. It interrupts the flow and is really jarring.  You could have at least recommended me an actually fun FPS like Quake.  The sarcasm just makes you look like a jerk, honestly."
residentevil,3cqedb,LexCrunch,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"I never really thought of assault rifles as a sub for handguns, I always considered them a weaker form of shotgun. I try to always use melee attacks whenever I can. sorting is less important than it was in RE4, since now only the hotkey locations matter.  idk about RE2, but RE1 you have maybe enough ammo to kill 1/3-1/2 of the enemies.  From Bunnyhop's video, you get about 15 bullets per 3 zombies, but each zombie takes 7-8 shots to kill. Hardly the case in RE4/5.  In later games, the better option is to kill enemies, so making you reload in-game adds tension, but in earlier games, the better option is to run away, so it's not a big deal to reload through your inventory.   Our experiences may simply differ but RE5 frequently annoyed me with how often I had no space, but that never happened in RE4, and I never spent more than maybe 20 seconds in the menu."
residentevil,3cqedb,MarcusQuintus,2,Wed Jul 15 17:18:37 2015 UTC,"9 slots so 4 weapons plus ammo fills up 8 slots already. That's smart.  4 weapons plus ammo  That's smart.   Handguns on both characters, shotgun on one, rifle on the other. If both players need the shotgun for CC, then you need to work on your distance game, because you should not be swarmed enough to need two shotguns. Magnum if you know there will be boss fights, which can be substituted for the many grenades found in-game. With all the ammo drops available, you can handle many bosses with the shotgun/rifle combo, plus the explosive barrels lying around.  I cleared professional. I can't remember if I used infinite ammo, although knowing my co-op partner, I doubt we did."
residentevil,3cqedb,bruce22n,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"Magnum not just for bossfights.  I like using it for taking out larger enemies quickly too, like the Big Man Magini, or the Tribal Chiefs.  It's more annoying to use a shotgun.   I suppose my problem is I haven't played with a good enough level of cohesion, so I often have to make sure I can handle everything alone."

The best advice I have is to learn all of your melee attacks and how to set them up, and learn to counter everything. That will help you learn enemy AI patterns and attack ranges, and give you free invincible power hits. It helps to try and learn these things in Mercenaries since it's essentially a combat sandbox.  The easiest way to learn to counter is to do the trick where you aim your gun, let go, and mash on the attack button while standing still. That will disable all but context-sensitive functions of the attack button for a couple seconds, making a counter come out whenever the prompt shows up."
residentevil,3cpkzb,LexCrunch,2,Thu Jul 9 19:38:35 2015 UTC,Or go into mercenaries and practice there.  That's what worked for me.

For example, right before fighting the giant plant, there was a room with a bunch of chemicals. The game went out of its way to tell me how to make the weedkiller potion thing, but it wouldn't let me do anything with the chemicals. It felt like I was missing something obvious, but then fighting the plant head-on worked fine. I even had access to the roots of the plant where it told me I should apply the potion.

residentevil,3clh1r,FreakLikeChewy,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"stay away from the movies. seriously.  honestly, just play them in order and skip the side games until afterwards because the main storyline is the best and most coherent.  go 2, 3, code veronica. 4 is a major departure, but its amazing and generally regarded as one of the best survival horror games ever made BUT its very different gameplay wise. that said, the controls are much, MUCH better so going back to the tank controls could be a pain in the ass. 5 gets a ton of flak but is pretty fun and well produced. just dont play it with anyone or else it isnt scary at all. 6 is apparently garbage but if youre a completionist get it and get the patches that fix the controls."

residentevil,3clh1r,matike,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:36:19 2015 UTC,"The live-action movies have a different plot to the games, so don't worry about them. You could watch them when you're more familiar with the games, to understand a few of the nods the films make to the games.  There are also two CG films which are canon, but they're quite a ways down the timeline from RE1 - I think they're both set some time after RE4, at least.  You could go for RE2 next if you want to continue the story as it was meant to be played, but you might struggle with the dated controls or graphics - in that case, I'd recommend trying the Revelations series next, or maybe something from RE4 onwards. I believe 4, 5 and 6 are all available on Steam.  Or you could play through the Umbrella Chronicles and Darkside Chronicles to familiarise yourself with the story of the series - these are basically rails-shooter remakes of the older, pre-RE4 titles in the series.  Or you could wait till next year and play the HD remaster of RE0, which will be the most similar game to the one you played, in terms of graphics and gameplay. Plus, it's set just before RE1 so it's good from a chronology point of view.  I'd really suggest going for RE2 though, if you can. It's available on many (mostly older) consoles - if you can find a Gamecube copy for cheap on eBay or something, then that can be played using the Dolphin emulator on your PC, which is a very stable and well-featured emulator."

residentevil,3clh1r,thedude2618,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"Go straight to RE2 and 3. Lore wise, they both take place in Raccoon City within the same 24 hours. So if you wanted to be really hardcore, you could play half of RE3, half of RE2 and then finish them both off. RE2 also has a 2nd Scenario that is influenced by your decisions on your first playthrough  RE2 is more about the origins of the outbreak, how the city got infected, the T and G Viruses, and the backround politics that were happening with Umbrella and the Raccoon Police Dept.  RE3 gives you a better perspective of what was going on in the streets and how the outbreak played out. Together, they give you the complete story of the Raccoon City incident which is referenced several times in later games.  After that, play Code Veronica. It follows Claire a few months after RE2 and contains a lot of information about the origins of Umbrella and the series main antagonist.  After that is RE4 which is a few years after RE2 and follows Leon when hes an agent working for the secret service.  Then play RE5. Chris is the main protagonist and he is a member of an anti bioterrorism organization called the BSAA.  Lastly comes RE6. Theres multiple campaigns and they all intertwine with each other at different points so you have to play all 4 of them to get the full picture. The main characters are Leon, Chris, Ada and Jake who is related to Wesker. Leon by far has the best campaign if you prefer Zombies and horror. Chris is the most action oriented, Ada's has a good bit of secret agent type stuff and Jakes is just kinda there. Though you do get to go hand to hand with a boss which is cool."

It is a stable version.  It includes the Ada gameplay, although I haven't played it yet. The graphics. Do not expect something really beautiful. The graphics were updated to be compatible with 1080p monitors. The characters and monsters look good, but the background(Walls, plants, ground) look as awful as the GCN version What, I can't crush Ganados' heads while they're head down? I guess that's a RE 5 thing... My only complain is the aim moving too much while pointing. Not sure if the mechanic is working as intended, if my configuration is wrong or what. I don't remember the aim moving this much in the GCN version, but it could.   It is a great, great port, I'm loving it so far.

As for the twin pistols, I don't find it all that shocking or out of place but that's just me I guess.  At least you aren't forced to use them if you don't want to."

residentevil,3cjftt,JoeKrauzer,2,Wed Jul 8 16:30:04 2015 UTC,"The cathedral is roughly on the same level as the city, not really significantly above it.

You've illustrated the complaint and lack of logic in the story line that both the OP in the video and myself are getting at.  The only theoretically possible way you could travel that far downward and dump out into a lake/ocean/whatever is if you started at a high altitude.

residentevil,3cjftt,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Thu Jul 9 03:36:03 2015 UTC,"I have a special dark place in my heart for akimbo handguns in just about anything. I think they're stupid.  In the case of Leon's guns, though, there are other reasons to hate them. They're the weakest handguns in the game, so scoring high in Mercenaries is made unnecessarily more difficult, and you're more likely to have an ammo crisis. The trade-off for whipping out a second one is that you get a gratuitously large magazine size that you don't need and a nearly worthless combo for your quickshots at the cost of accuracy and reload speed, which is not at all worth it. You don't even get a rate of fire boost because pistols already fire as fast as you can push the button.  One fun thing to do, though, is to isolate one guy and do the entire quickshot combo on him. He goes flying into the air and bounces off your bullets like in Devil May Cry. I'm just about convinced that was intentional reference, considering that Leon's face actually bears a striking resemblance to Dante's from DMC4."
residentevil,3cjftt,LexCrunch,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:21:17 2015 UTC,You know that last part actually makes a bit of sense. I can see the Capcom team doing a nod towards DMC in a way.  I mean... I guess I can see where you're coming from. I for one enjoy the shit out of them. Most of the time they are used to set up melee combos (most of my kills with Leon are with his feet. His deadly deadly feat of feet...) but the second one off-hand acts as a good crowd control secondary. As for ammo I don't generally have an issue.  Now if we're on the topic of machine pistols then yes... It's so damn stupid. One of my least favorite guns in the entire game: Ada's Ammo Box. Thing is a piece of gimmicky garbage. It's just so bad.

residentevil,3chkzq,kikaider007,5,Wed Jul 8 01:31:37 2015 UTC,"The U.S. Government was the top customer of Umbrella. Apart from this they are not involved in bioterrorism.  The Family isn't a bioterrorism organization. It did instigate a bioterrorism incident in Tall Oaks for its own purposes, but its true purpose is to revolutionize war with biological weapons.

residentevil,3chkzq,FreakLikeChewy,7,Tue Jul 7 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"This I feel is a pretty legitimate question.

See people like 4, and I get it. It had really great gameplay and game mech. but as a resident evil it didn't continue or take anything from older resident evil's outside leon and ada. While with the others, you have had so many links between games and made this simple yet complicated story line of Umbrella, Wesker, and Raccoon City. 4 did nothing but a stand alone title which is you took out leon and ada could of been a whole new IP."
residentevil,3chkzq,DrHoenybun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:42:54 2015 UTC,"Story wise, they're definitely Resident Evil games. Resident Evil is about bioweapons (I mean, the name of the game is Biohazard, after all) and RE4 was clearly about a bioweapon... indeed, it was about a bioweapon terrorist event (infecting the president's daughter so you can send her back and cause a catastrophe).  Really, the only horror aspects of RE has been zombies and jump scares. You can't continue a series with just those two things. It needed to evolve and, seeing as how RE4 is easily one of the best games ever made, it seems like a successful evolution to me."
residentevil,3chkzq,LexCrunch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:14:07 2015 UTC,"Resident Evil as a core, defined what Survival Horror. It wasn't about the jump scares or the zombies. The older Resident Evils 0 - CV, point was that you don't know what is going to happen next. You didn't know what was around the corner if you had enough ammo if you had enough health. It wasn't the same horror aspects of Fatal Frame, and Silent Hill games. It was truly about being stuck in an area with limited supplies, and not knowing where to go what to do. While with replay the scare factor really diminishes. But at the core the older games were better. Anything after 4 really took away from the whole you don't have ammo, and you need to watch what you spend. In the first couple if you messed up mixing herbs or used one to early you were stuck and could have died at a moments notice. While, with the newer games, you have the merchant, you have the upgrades, you have the ways around the ammo situation. While Story Wise, the games were lackluster. All of Resident Evil 4's stories really could have been thrown out the window. It really had no impact, while all 5 all that was added was Wesker's Death / Wesker Children (Stupid Plot Point To begin with). The real thing is they had umbrella as the big bad, and when they destroyed Umbrella, it was well damn. Let's use more Wesker, and then well... that's getting old. WESKER CHILDREN is the answer. While, I know the plot points for pre-4 were just Umbrella did this, Umbrella did that. They basically called it as the fall of Umbrella as just one cutscene in four. No story, no game with the fall just a brief mention.   When 4 came out, the games swiftly switched from Survival Horror to Action Horror and left out what made the games great. Not saying they are bad, outside of 5. They were just meh, and the story really has nowhere to go. The only last Wesker Child was Alex and they solved that with Resident Evil: Rev 2."
residentevil,3chkzq,iash91,2,Sat Jul 11 19:54:56 2015 UTC,"The way I see it: As an action game, RE6 is good. Controls are clunky and the AI is awkward, but still. As an entry in the Resident Evil franchise...ugh."
residentevil,3chkzq,LexCrunch,0,Sat Jul 11 21:22:34 2015 UTC,This is what people don't get through the heads... we aren't saying that 6 / 5 / 4 were bad from a gamplay ... yet for story and resident evil games they fell short.
residentevil,3chkzq,iash91,2,Wed Jul 8 01:39:32 2015 UTC,because 5 and 6 were actually fantastic. I don't know what you're on.
residentevil,3chkzq,LexCrunch,3,Wed Jul 8 12:16:19 2015 UTC,"5 was great. 6? Urgh... As a game it was okay, like there no ground breaking bugs, everything seemed to operate fine. It just didn't gel well, like the gameplay with the action they were focusing on... in my opinion."
residentevil,3chkzq,iash91,2,Wed Jul 8 01:30:11 2015 UTC,"Someone on here once suggested that it felt like the combat designers and scenario writers didn't really communicate with 6, which is a pretty good hypothesis as to why the combat, despite being really well done, doesn't seem to blend well with the  campaign but makes Mercenaries so great."
residentevil,3chkzq,EQUASHNZRKUL,3,Wed Jul 8 01:55:33 2015 UTC,"It could be the issue. It could also be the simple fact that they were trying to blend horror gameplay, with the fluidity of action gameplay, just so they could make Leon's campaign still feel horror, and Chris' campaign feel action, whilst not changing any of the actual gameplay itself. Then failed on all accounts."
residentevil,3chkzq,LexCrunch,-1,Wed Jul 8 02:05:36 2015 UTC,The action was goofy and the horror was a joke. Like literally. I actually don't know if they were kidding or not with that one. That doesn't change the fact that the game itself is a blast to play.
residentevil,3chkzq,DrHoenybun,2,Wed Jul 8 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, it's great to play, just like I found ORC a fun game to play coop. Unlike ORC though, I just don't feel the gameplay meshed well with what they were going for at all."
residentevil,3chkzq,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:38:05 2015 UTC,"Control-wise, the PC port sucked. The pretty decent combat was completely eclipsed by the inability to do anything other than walk and shoot because of the completely unintuitive control scheme"

residentevil,3chkzq,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:10:02 2015 UTC,"Never understood why, 4 wasn't really a ""Resident Evil"" game. There wasn't things that the fans loved, and really could of been a standalone game. 5 had a decent story, but terrible follow through. 6 was agreed upon as average."
residentevil,3chkzq,Lucid003,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:23:01 2015 UTC,"RE 4 revitalized a stale series which sales had been free falling. It was RE 4 or nothing, and that game is to credit that the series continued past 2005.  There are a lot of things that fans love about RE 4. The entire fan base is not comprised of the vocal minority of survival horror purists.  The sales of RE 5 and 6 clearly show that people want that sort of a Resident Evil game."
residentevil,3chkzq,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:15:18 2015 UTC,"That's what DrHoenybun doesn't seem to understand: He's confusing genre with story. I can't speak for 6, but 4 and 5 were, without a doubt, Resident Evil storylines."
residentevil,3chkzq,Lucid003,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"At least RE 5 was, but 4's a bit arguable."
residentevil,3chkzq,parrisnorris,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's about bioweapons and bioterror, just like the rest of the games. It even has the research labs and everything. The only real difference is that it's a new bioweapon (no zombies). I mean, it's specifically about infecting the president's daughter so they can send her back and cause some kind of catastrophe.   I'll admit that the bioweapons (las plagas) are a bit odd (hey, look, a giant!), but there's no doubt in my mind that it's a RE story."
residentevil,3chkzq,hercoldhands,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"My point was that it's a standalone story that doesn't have much to do with the rest of the series, and only later supplemental material has made RE 4 at least somewhat relevant.  RE 5 was much more of a sequel and a conclusion to the original story."

residentevil,3chq4x,Jabnin,3,Wed Jul 8 00:49:03 2015 UTC,"I don't see how that ruins any aspect of the game. It's not like the XBONE's standby mode gives you save states. If you die, you still have to go back to where you saved. It's almost exactly the same as pressing PAUSE and leaving it alone."
residentevil,3chq4x,LexCrunch,2,Wed Jul 8 07:40:32 2015 UTC,Yah this is called stand-by or rest mode and on ps4 (don't have an xbone) it can be turned off easily
residentevil,3chq4x,SherlockJones1994,2,Wed Jul 8 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"I mean, the limited saves are only really thrilling because they define where you restart if you die. It was never really that cool that you needed to find a save point before you could stop playing!"

I saved a LOT because I didn't often play in long sessions, but even still I had way more ink ribbons in the end than I'd ever need."

residentevil,3cavqf,JoeKrauzer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with giving it a go.  Maybe those competing should comment here and let everyone know they've made a submission?

residentevil,3cavqf,JoeKrauzer,3,Mon Jul 6 16:45:07 2015 UTC,"Well, the other reason I liked the idea of anonymising entries is that nobody would have to know how embarrassingly under-attended the challenges usually are. But I guess if I say that entrants are welcome to comment here saying they've entered, but aren't required to do so, then there's still a chance that dozens if not thousands of people are entering without commenting, so it's OK"

I still think the REMake design was cool too, but maybe they could be a bit darker-looking somehow. I also thought it was a lot more unnerving how they usually just sat motionless down corridors, forcing you to approach them as much as you didn't want to.  Only other thing I can think of is how the Chimeras disintegrate. Maybe it's my RE4 hatred seething through, but I really never liked that effect.

residentevil,3c7u6r,relivesa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:14:10 2015 UTC,Director's Cut would be great. I can't think of anything else.
residentevil,3c7u6r,Jabnin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:31:38 2015 UTC,The music from the original. Original music + all the improvements of REmake would be an epic combination.

residentevil,3c7u6r,HaouLeo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:59:01 2015 UTC,Dual audio. Most of the time I prefer Japanese game to have Japanese spoken language. The option would be nice since it would require literally no work to include it.
residentevil,3c6neu,raynehk14,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:54:30 2015 UTC,"I can't find any accounts of someone getting this error while trying to use the split-screen mod. I'm guessing that if it's giving you a Steam error, then there's probably some complication with your installation that's left traces of the Steam version or something. I'd recommend completely removing and then reinstalling the game from scratch through GFWL if that's at all possible."
residentevil,3c6neu,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"I have done ""delete local cache"" and redownload again, still no dice.  Maybe I should check if there's any regedit entry left when I get home"

residentevil,3c3kij,NXMT,11,Sat Jul 4 12:43:48 2015 UTC,"My first Resident Evil was RE2, which is why it will always be my favorite and Leon my favorite character.   I was 8 years old when it came out and somehow still had some of my Christmas money lying around. My 14 year old brother kept telling me to save my money and buy this new game coming out. He has already spent his money but we had gotten a Playstation the Christmas before so he wanted to make sure we got more games.   The guy working the Kmart electronics counter didn't even flinch when I asked for that game out of the case. I even bought the strategy guide.   We get home and open the case. How the hell does a game need 2 discs? I didn't know which one to put in first so eventually I just put the one with Leon in the Playstation. The game booted up with this ominous voice and terrifying eye on the screen. The city's a wreck, cars are in fire, I think I used my all my ammunition on the first zombie I saw.   I was terrified, and I was hooked. It took me 15 hours to beat the game the first time I played it. Then I found out you had to play as Claire too! Awesome, it was like 2 games in 1. I couldn't imagine beating it quick enough to unlock tofu and hunk, it blew my young mind. This is why I want a remake of RE2 so bad. To do the things 8 year old me couldn't do.   Resident evil 2 got me addicted to the resident evil series. I received directors cut for my birthday a few months later, nemesis for the following Christmas. I even bought a GameCube just for the resident evil games.(and luigis mansion, that game was boss) I've owned Resident Evil 4 and 4 different consoles(GameCube, Wii, PS2, Xbox 360) and have probably beaten it 15 times. Got all the achievements for Resident evil 5 and was so disappointed in Re6 that I gave up half way through leons campaign.   I can't wait to have a good solid remake of resident evil 2. Nothing would make me happier than finally being able to achieve the things young langis_on never did."
residentevil,3c3kij,langis_on,7,Sat Jul 4 13:06:22 2015 UTC,My first RE was 5. I know it got a lot of bad rep for being not scary and all that but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Especially Mercenaries.
residentevil,3c3kij,Mekbop,6,Sat Jul 4 13:33:12 2015 UTC,"I loved 5! And 6.. screw the haters! They are still great games, even if they weren't true to the classic 'survival horror' genre."
residentevil,3c3kij,AlxSTi,3,Sat Jul 4 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"That's only because you don't know any better.  Edit: I enjoyed it, especially playing with a friend. I just hate that it's your first RE game, for your sake."
residentevil,3c3kij,raysweater,5,Sat Jul 4 15:20:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I was too much of a pussy to play the ones before. When my elder bro played RE3 at night I will go into my room because I'm too scared to watch him play :`D  I also only played RE5 with my bro all the way. Never did it solo at all."
residentevil,3c3kij,Mekbop,4,Sat Jul 4 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"My first was RE2 on PSX. I was 11 or 12, visiting my much older brother out of state (I lived in DE and he was in WI). I was going to be there for a few days and he had to work some of that time, so I guess he felt like I needed entertainment and bought me a PSX and whatever video game I wanted from Toys R Us the day I arrived. I picked RE2 and went back to his house that night to play. This was my first video game experience since SNES and I was hooked. Too bad we forgot a memory card! I ended up playing the game straight through without saving once. I must have left the system on and shut the TV to sleep at some point. For some reason I still vividly remember the giant spiders in the sewer and the purple plants you had to eat to fight the poison. Little did I know, that was just the beginning for me. Once I was back home, it was FFVII, Tony Hawk, and Tekken for months. It's funny how I thought spending 40+ hours playing a video game was insane back then. I think I have ~300 hours logged in to Destiny on PS4."

residentevil,3c3kij,TarsierBoy,4,Sat Jul 4 15:25:15 2015 UTC,"My first was RE1 in 2006. My parents were already huge fans of the series and had always suggested I play them. So, one night, I started up the original! And for about the week after, I had one of the most amazing gaming experiences of my life. Shamefully, I had to use a guide to get through some spots. I proceeded to play the entire series including spin-offs and now it's my absolute favorite series."
residentevil,3c3kij,CrossbonesGT,4,Sat Jul 4 15:37:57 2015 UTC,"RE 3: my friends an I used to get together to play PS1 and they decided to play RE3. We were 5 or 6 kids, so everyone had at least 20 min to play and then give the controller to the next person. I was 14 and I was really scared to play it so I didn't play when it was turn. It took them several days because nobody had enough chance to practice and they were killed very often.  One day I decided that I wanted to try. Nobody refused because I spent days just watching all of them playing. I got the controller in a weird factory. I remember that I destroyed a helicopter, killed a monster using some acid and then killed the same monster with a huge cannon. I can remember the faces of my friends when they saw the credits.   Please excuse my English."
residentevil,3c3kij,jonnieve,3,Sat Jul 4 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"Remake on the GCN, I was probably about ten or so? I couldn't play it for more than ten minutes at a time because just being in the mansion scared the shit out of me so I never made much progress in it. I still proceeded to buy every other RE game though because they were all out on the Gamecube. I didn't do a proper playthrough of it for years."
residentevil,3c3kij,windwaker910,3,Sat Jul 4 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"RE4 on the Gamecube. I found the game really unsettling and crazy hard (I was like 11). I'd constantly run out of ammo and rely on the shitty TMP because the only comfort I found in that creepy atmosphere was pumping a group of villagers with like 50 bullets before running away.   I played REmake and RE2/3 years later, and they're now my favorites of the franchise."
residentevil,3c3kij,tiger66261,4,Sat Jul 4 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"Mine was RE2. When I was 4, I used to see my brother and cousin play it all the time. When I was 8 I start play it myself and I trully loved it! Scary as hell and very challenging, but play it in easy was never a option. I remember to like more the scenario B because I could see more police cars xD And since I know about RE, my playtimes with micromachines turn to be much more related to Raccoon City :P The first one I bought was the RE Gaiden for the Gameboy Color. What a precious!!  I miss the times in my cousins house, where we playd RE 2 and 3 through the night..."
residentevil,3c3kij,stratcaster,2,Sat Jul 4 14:41:30 2015 UTC,RE2 and still my favorite.  Made me go out and play RE1 on the PS.  Obviously wasn't as good to me but the same style and such made me like it too hehe
residentevil,3c3kij,sungazer69,2,Sat Jul 4 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"I don't remember much, I started with RE: Survivor and RE3. I wasn't even 6 at the time I first played them."
residentevil,3c3kij,mistar_z,2,Sat Jul 4 18:31:08 2015 UTC,I was 8 or 9 and it was 1998.  Well the first one I actually played was 1 but the first one my eyes laid witness to gameplay of was 2. My aunt was huge into Resident Evil at the time and brought over 2 to play with me. At that time I was extremely scared of horror stuff and I remember then she got to Kendo's Gun shop I nearly shit myself hiding under the covers plugging my ears as I heard the zombies clash through onto Kendo and chomping on his body. Those sounds and visuals haunted me for a long time.   Then as time went on I decided to be brave and one of my dads coworkers was giving away a bunch of games. One of those happen to be RE Directors Cut with the stragedy guide. So after my dad got me those I was honestly really excited and scared for my life as to what I was about to endure.   First thing first I selected Jill as my first play-through and the sound and visual it makes when you select a character that gave me goosebumps.As the opening scene of Alpha team landing and almost all of them getting wiped out in black and white I was at an awe of the classic horror style. I remember clashing into the mansion with the biggest oh shit look on my face I had no idea what to do.....Then......  I walked into the dinning hall clutching onto my controller and taking in the sounds one beat at a time. Barry at my side I felt a little better but when I found the blood I shit myself and when I had to go into the hallway that did not make things any easier for little me. Then its back that god awful sound I was so terrified of from RE2 of teeth tearing human tissue. As I turned the corner and gazed at the zombie overlooking Kenneth as he was devouring him like a stuffed turkey I flung back held R1 and rapidly pressed square until I emptied my clip and blood poured from the rotting corpse I felt a sudden ush of belief that I could do this and as I returned to Barry and we left to find no Wesker in the main hall. I realized I couldn't turn back anymore and I took to my leave and drove into the world of survival horror........Resident Evil....  Then I found Silent Hill and oh boy that fucking terrified me......
residentevil,3c3kij,pwnedkiller,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think most boys our age back then would have picked Chris first only to later find out it was the ""hard mode"" of sorts. It took either guides or friends to tell us Jill had it much easier. Playing RE2 used to make me scared to sleep alone! It was akin to watching a horror movie. Would get my ass chewed out by my mother for deliberately making things difficult for myself and almost took away me RE games!"
residentevil,3c3kij,-J_C-,2,Sat Jul 4 23:39:31 2015 UTC,First Resident Evil was RE: Deadly Silence; the DS port of RE1.  Wouldn't have it any other way.
residentevil,3c3kij,residentweafer,2,Sat Jul 4 20:58:12 2015 UTC,"Me and my friend played the original during a sleepover we walked around the mansion for a bit. Saw the first zombie cutscene and laughed at how cheesy it was. Back to the main hall, laughed again at the master of unlocking part the we went through the hall with the dog. Neither of us expected it and when it crashed through the window we shat bricks and both of us jumped to shut off the ps1"
residentevil,3c3kij,bensawn,2,Sat Jul 4 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"First one I beat was 4. Pants shittingly scary. First overall experience was RE2. Creepy, but I was more intrigued than anything. I still think 4 had the best balance of controls, scariness, and polish."
residentevil,3c3kij,screamalongsongs,2,Sat Jul 4 21:41:12 2015 UTC,First experience was an RE2 burned copy my friend had for PS1. I got to play for 20 minutes before the Game Genie reset itself over and over again.... First actual play through was RE6 worked my way backwards.  Love affair ever since.
residentevil,3c3kij,jaggular,2,Sat Jul 4 22:52:46 2015 UTC,"My first RE was the very first one back when the PlayStation initially came out. Simply put, it was amazing. Atmosphere, gameplay, music... There really wasn't anything like it. And the dogs jumping through the windows scared the shit out of me."
residentevil,3c3kij,samurai5625,2,Sun Jul 5 04:53:16 2015 UTC,"RE2, back when it first came out in January 1998. I tried it and got quickly scared, I knew this was a game on a completely different level than what I was used to."
residentevil,3c3kij,jonhart989,2,Sun Jul 5 05:24:56 2015 UTC,"My first experience was with the original, I was 6 or 7 and watched my dad play from behind the couch. I watched him play through that one and the second one. It wasn't until I got a Dreamcast that I played Code Veronica. I was like 10 or 11 at the time and thought it was pretty tough, so I sold a bunch of other games to buy RE2 and 3 for the Dreamcast, beat those and then beat Code Veronica finally. So I mostly have my dad to thank for getting me interested, and my uncle for getting us the Dreamcast. I'm 25 now going on 26 so you could say I've loved the series almost my entire life."
residentevil,3c3kij,frampton1337,2,Sun Jul 5 05:26:22 2015 UTC,"I first played RE3 back when I was like 10 and fucking terrible at games. I didn't actually get to beat the game because I wasted all my ammo and just kept dieing but that wasn't even the part that sticks with me the most. The very first time I fought Nemesis and the time he spent chasing me solidified him as a villain that is forever amongst the great. That feeling of dread as I heard that iconic ""Stars."" Is something I will never lose."
residentevil,3c3kij,kingt34,2,Sun Jul 5 07:14:27 2015 UTC,"Technically my first RE experience was on one of those demo disks were I got to play RE2 but there was a time limit. I don't know why, but the time limit somehow made everything more horrifying because of how tense it was to get as far as I can before the trial ended. It was a lot of fun playing the demo again and again trying to get better at it, but I was still like 6 years old so I was always absolutely freaked out by EVERYTHING. I think I lost my mind when I first encountered the licker... Got pretty much instantly killed."
residentevil,3c3kij,nowolfcanknow,2,Sun Jul 5 09:07:48 2015 UTC,The first one I played was the original in 1998 when I was 8. But the first one I completed and really played was 2 when it was released.
residentevil,3c3kij,T_Snake451,2,Sun Jul 5 10:18:23 2015 UTC,"The very first one. My brother rented it from Blockbuster, and I'll never forget the scene with the first zombie chewing on Kenneth and him slowly turning around with blood on his lips. We honestly had no idea how to play and got about as far as the hallway leading to the Tiger statue where we got mobbed by zombies and died.   We would try the series again with RE2, when we became longtime fans of the series. The kennel scene still gets me sometimes."

About 6 or 7 times lol. Then I had to wait about a year and a half til they ported it over to the N64.  One of the greatest days ever!!
residentevil,3c3kij,Ardious,0,Thu Jul 16 07:07:05 2015 UTC,"My first one was the original RE.  MY friend's mom worked for Sony, and he was able to get a lot of games early. He, his brother, and I spent hours playing it.  It began my love of RE games, as well as the zombie genre in general."
residentevil,3c4jie,mistar_z,5,Sat Jul 4 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"No. In fact, I was really confused when I first played the Moira campaign because in my play through, she was dead. That was when I learned there was a good and bad ending in the first place."
residentevil,3c4jie,LexCrunch,2,Sat Jul 4 19:12:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah that actually bugged me quite a bit when I got the ""bad"" ending.

residentevil,3bzhaf,skunkowns,4,Fri Jul 3 12:05:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't done it since t he REmake came out, but if I remember correctly, you need to circle him and make him do one of his swings. This should leave him open for one slice. He also does a grab, if you dodge that you should be able to get in two slices.  You need a lot of healing items, because he is going to hit you, especially when you are baiting him for the grab attack.  Good luck!"
residentevil,3bzhaf,FreakLikeChewy,2,Fri Jul 3 15:03:19 2015 UTC,"You do remember correctly.  One swipe only when he grabs for you.  Bait him into it and then swipe and run around again.  I just did it on PC when REmake came out and this is the method.  Load up your inventory with healing items and your knife.  You will use all of them.  Also, if you play as Chris, he has more HP so you can get hit more often than if you play as Jill."

residentevil,3bzhaf,funeralcasual,2,Sat Jul 4 00:19:54 2015 UTC,Its possible to do without getting hit at all. the more you can get him to lunge on the right side of the camera the easier it is. A lot of the time you can get 2 slices in.
residentevil,3bzhaf,relivesa,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:44:47 2015 UTC,I've got every achievement in the game but this one.  As much as I'd love to have all the achievements this one just seems waaaaay too time consuming and honestly a bit boring / aggravating.
residentevil,3bx0wk,Shikadi314,3,Thu Jul 2 21:14:51 2015 UTC,"I like how the guy showing off the game demonstrates how game-breaking and exploitative the updated control scheme is by easily baiting zombie grabs to run past them. Movement acceleration in the original was made more sluggish after the REmake, probably just to make that a lot harder to do."
residentevil,3bx0wk,LexCrunch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:59:00 2015 UTC,I want Type E controls in this game so badly. I'm going to start tweeting them every day to add it in.

residentevil,3bxqhe,indosurf101,16,Fri Jul 3 00:51:24 2015 UTC,"While I believe it will happen at some point, I think you're looking at a minimum 2 years wait for an RE2 Remake. And that's under the assumption that RE0 does well. If you want to play it, I'd just get it now. If you just want to experience the story, RE: The Darkside Chronicles isn't awful."
residentevil,3bxqhe,The_Naked_Snake,9,Fri Jul 3 01:40:34 2015 UTC,"RE2 is the best in the franchise imo. Buy it and don't look back, such a great story"
residentevil,3bxqhe,paulbamf,3,Fri Jul 3 06:16:49 2015 UTC,"Same. I really hope RE1 and RE0 are a test market, to see if there is interest in more remakes. Since ""Remastered"" is big right now. I know an RE2 request is pretty big, since it would be made from the ground up. But hot damn, I would be in heaven."
residentevil,3bxqhe,Krayzed896,5,Fri Jul 3 08:17:28 2015 UTC,I think people may be overlooking the fact REmake and 0 remake were the perfect business combination - relatively simple to produce and highly popular.  RE2 would be a much bigger investment for a similar level of popularity and therefore profit. Unfortunately I bet it'll never happen.
residentevil,3bxqhe,paulbamf,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:26:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  People have pointed out that theyre doing HD remasters because theyre pretty damn easy, as opposed to designing an entire game from the ground up."
residentevil,3bxqhe,OpieKid,5,Sat Jul 4 05:34:39 2015 UTC,"I would get it now.  Its a good game, has still held up, and they haven't even announced a remake of 2 so I'm not even sure how long of a wait it will be."
residentevil,3bxqhe,The_Ostrich_Guy,3,Fri Jul 3 01:41:54 2015 UTC,"RE2 is the best constructed game in the entire series in my opinion. I hold it in such high regard that I doubt it could be topped even if a remake actually came out for it, as cool as that would be.  Just play the game. There is zero reason not to, anyway. Besides, if a remake ever did come out, then you'll have a much greater appreciation for it, having played the original."
residentevil,3bxqhe,LexCrunch,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:51:02 2015 UTC,"Imo, RE4 just barely takes that title from RE2. Mostly because of the currency system and the slightly superior replayability. Nonetheless, RE2 is a feat of game design and a very impressive installment. In he series."
residentevil,3bxqhe,EQUASHNZRKUL,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:35:31 2015 UTC,"4 is pretty fun sometimes, but it's so utterly broken that I couldn't in good conscience label it anything close to the most well constructed."
residentevil,3bxqhe,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:27:07 2015 UTC,"RE4 was an amazing game, but it was an absolute shit Resident Evil game.  It had none of the puzzles, none of the tight, interwoven level design, no feeling of isolation, it relied too much on jump scares, and they solved the whole plot of the first four games off-screen before the game started.  It was extremely fun, and one of my favourite games, but it was a really poor Resident Evil, and unfortunately it was so great they didn't make any more Resident Evils that weren't actiony over-the-shoulder shooters."
residentevil,3bxqhe,Baconwich,2,Sat Jul 11 18:25:03 2015 UTC,"The problem is, this is CAPCOM we are talking about.. we might be waiting years to see the RE2 remake.  However, with the amazing sales of the original Re-REmake, and them testing the waters with Zero, I wouldn't see why this wouldn't happen at some point.  Other than RE4, Resident Evil 2 is a fan favorite, and I know for certain I will buy it the second it's announced.  But if you a fan of the series, I would play the original too.. Such an amazing game for it's time.. Make sure you beat all the ''scenarios (A and B) You will love it even more."
residentevil,3bxqhe,FreakLikeChewy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"One of the main reasons they didn't do a remake of RE2 back in the Gamecube days is because it holds up better, at least visually, than the original Resident Evil did.  Still definitely old-school, but one of my favourites."
residentevil,3bxqhe,Baconwich,2,Sat Jul 11 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"Why not get it now? The PS1 version is super cheap and availble on like half a dozen platforms. IMO the best version was Gamecube version, it had all the extras added in from later releases (save for one of the easter eggs that was added into the N64 version) and the graphics where slightly improved. And hey, it'll make the potential remake even more fun if they do what they did to REmake and completely redesign the puzzles and add new areas. That was the best part of starting REmake for the first time, how it took everything I new to a T about RE1's item placement and puzzles, and just threw them out the window."
residentevil,3bxqhe,Sissle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:39:40 2015 UTC,"I was reading shit about REmake online, and apparently they did things to intentionally screw with people who knew the old RE1 mansion like the back of their hand. Like the tiger eyes- in the remake, you put the yellow and blue gems in, but in the OG version,  you put the blue and red in. If you put the red gem in,  the tiger statue slides up and hella snakes fall in to the room"
residentevil,3bxqhe,OpieKid,2,Sat Jul 4 03:23:08 2015 UTC,Yep. I loved that shit. And if you type in the original ADA/JOHN password into the lab computer the computer will yell at you in Japanese.

RE 2 - Leon A, Claire B, Claire A, Leon B, All normal, also first time playing through them, after giving up on a Leon A run years ago on Easy on the GC. Was surprised at how easy Normal was this time. I would like to try a harder difficulty, but I played the PSN version this time, and Normal is as high as it goes. =/  RE ORC - Just enough to remember why I hate this game. -_-  RE CVX - Normal, 1st playthrough.  RE 4 HD - Professional. Beaten this game dozens of times, no biggie. I go back to it all the time, trying new runs and weapon configurations.  RE Revelations - Normal, first playthrough.  RE 5 Pro. Been wanting to complete this for years, finally did it, with AI Sheva, and without using the Infinite Rocket Launcher. Was tough as hell, (And honestly, rather cheap at times) but I'm glad I did it.  And I think that it's it. I have the first episode of Revelations 2 I still need to play.

residentevil,3bxdek,stratcaster,3,Thu Jul 2 22:55:41 2015 UTC,"Turn down your graphics settings. Turning off v-sync will help a lot, lowering the resolution nearly as much. If you're trying to run the game at 60 FPS, then you'll unfortunately need to turn that down to 30 since in that case, your machine apparently can't handle it.  If you're running in a window, switch it to full screen instead and see if that helps. Some people think playing in a window reduces processor demand when in reality it's the opposite."

residentevil,3bwlf7,LexCrunch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:21:28 2015 UTC,I think that has to do with the route you take and the order in which you do things. There are a ton of cutscenes in RE1 that I've never seen despite having played it several times.

residentevil,3bsg35,NXMT,2,Wed Jul 1 23:21:10 2015 UTC,"God, I hate that Crimson so much. He's the only one in the game, aside from the Elder, that you HAVE to deal with.

residentevil,3bsg35,CidCrisis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:16:17 2015 UTC,"Well you don't have to deal with him.  You could just do what I do and never use that hallway unless you have to.  I only go through the main part of that hallway once, and that is to pick up the arrow.  After that, nope."
residentevil,3bsg35,JoeKrauzer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you have to pass him to get a key (Either Shield or Armor, can't remember which) and he automatically gets up at that point if he hasn't already."
residentevil,3bsg35,CidCrisis,2,Thu Jul 2 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, he stands up when you run over him to get the Armor key.  After that he relocates to the mirror section of that hall and you no longer have to bother with him.  Later on, you just duck through the far end of that hall when going back and forth from the library area or run through where he originally was to get to the library in the first place."
residentevil,3bsg35,JoeKrauzer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"That's correct! I think I remember that's what I did in my last playthrough actually. I was surprised because I didn't think he moved after you leave the area, so I usually just blew his head off when he got up to be done with him."
residentevil,3bsg35,CidCrisis,2,Fri Jul 3 02:39:17 2015 UTC,So I started the remake recently and never played RE on the past gen so I didn't know what to expect from enemies other than zombies of course and I can confidently say that I probably shit myself when I first met a crimson head.

I'm a bit burned out on Chris and to a lesser extent Leon (why did they make him so humorless in 6?).
residentevil,3bsdqm,themikesem,3,Wed Jul 1 20:17:07 2015 UTC,Wasn't it an extension of the REmake look? They just splashed some blonde on her. And added alot of skin tight gear.  And dat ass.  why did they make him so humorless in 6?  They made the entire game take a nose dive in the humour department.
residentevil,3bsdqm,NXMT,3,Wed Jul 1 23:24:00 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I thought 6 was pretty damn funny. A lot of it was likely unintentional, though."

residentevil,3bsdqm,NXMT,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced that at least since #4, RE has been self-aware and playing with how goofy it can be, and 6 took it to a whole new level. There's no way you could consciously do something as silly and downright stupid as giving Leon twin pistols without laughing at yourself.  That said, RE6 is still my second favorite in the series."

residentevil,3bsdqm,Ryndis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:20:53 2015 UTC,"It's just the overall tone especially with Chris' emotional RAAAAAAGE. I get that there needs to be some contrast between all the campaigns but any cynical chimes just felt like forced edginess. The only real playful banter was from Ada I think but that's been an ongoing characteristic. Leon switched different phases between all his appearances.  Come to think of it, the most ""light"" campaign was Sherry/Jake."

residentevil,3bsdqm,Darkar123,2,Thu Jul 2 07:11:21 2015 UTC,"True, I guess part of the reason I liked him was because he was related to Wesker.

residentevil,3bsdqm,FreakLikeChewy,2,Thu Jul 2 08:04:24 2015 UTC,Well in all honesty (Haven't played either Revelations yet) .. Albert Wesker is a master of disception.. Who's to say he didn't fake his death like he did in Resident Evil 1.. who's to say.. it wasn't a clone?
residentevil,3bsdqm,Darkar123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"That's what I think at times. In fact, every time I see the last scene in RE5, I see the missiles passing next to Wesker's head, missing him. Although it's too farfetched, I kinda want it to be true."
residentevil,3bsdqm,Ryndis,2,Thu Jul 2 18:52:05 2015 UTC,"At the end of Ada's campaign in 6 we see Ada visibly shaken for the first time. Even when she finds out there is a clone impersonating her shes still pretty level headed, but whatever hatched from that egg at the end of her campaign struck a nerve with her.  Could've been Wesker. OR MAYBE A LEON CLONE?"

residentevil,3bsdqm,Darkar123,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:01:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, seeing all of the things he has survived, it wouldn't be surprising to see him survive that. Plus, he'd be an even bigger badass."

residentevil,3bsdqm,Zaeh,2,Fri Jul 3 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"Capcom didn't get a really bad response from Jake. The response was pretty average, overall.  There's no story to finish. Each game has been a standalone story for years already. There's no reboot necessary for the story part of the series."

residentevil,3bsdqm,ZazMan117,2,Wed Jul 1 23:42:43 2015 UTC,"Revelations 2, is a step in the right direction.  despite the great atmosphere of the first revelations game and how strong the enemies were, I was still tripping over ammo everywhere on the survivor difficulty.   With Revelations 2, even on normal ammo is something I'm really scared of using because enemies don't drop anything and if you want to scavenge ammo you're going work pretty hard to find enough of them.  I really hope future titles are more survival orientated,  I wouldn't even mind if any new side titles or the main titles goes full on action if they're honest about it. Like Chris's RE6 campaign which was full on action and was unapologetically honest about it and I really loved that. Unlike the rest of 6 which tried to juggle both but failed to do so."

I want Revelations 3 to have a green theme, this goes with Rebecca's classic attire, and could take place in the jungles of Africa and allow Sheva to come back."
residentevil,3bsgbp,stak640,2,Wed Jul 1 22:25:27 2015 UTC,Just imagine.   Revelations = Blue just like Jill's color scheme. Revelations 2 = Red like Claire's color scheme.   If anything green gets leaked for REV3 then Hallelujah! Becky's back.  Hope it'll be like a jungle or something.

Maybe Rebecca has been imprisoned in a secret Umbrella lab for the past twenty years, presumed dead. The lab is completely cut off from the rest of the world and is entirely self-sufficient, so they've kept going even though Umbrella itself has been gone for years. Could bring Billy back too, in that case. Maybe they both got nabbed around the time Raccoon City was going to shit"

residentevil,3bsgbp,kikaider007,2,Thu Jul 2 18:12:23 2015 UTC,I think she would do fine on her own in a game.  Billy wouldn't show up in a game unless the outbreak happened where he is so if it was billy and rebecca in a game then she would probably have to be visiting him.  I think Sheva and Keith Lumley could have a game together since they're both stationed in africa.  Helena and Claire would be interesting.  Listening to them talk about Leon for some comic relief might be entertaining.

residentevil,3bsgbp,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:37:45 2015 UTC,What you say is true although I think we can all agree the classic way of doing partners (mainly a single-player experience with your partner occasionally helping out through cutscenes or certain gameplay segments) is the better alternative to a fully fleshed out co-op mechanic.

It is one of the most important plots in the series and they did everything they can to make people anticipate and shit themselves. Now that it's all out and that is said and done. Get the retail and feel the pain until RE7 or 8 comes out! Capcom likes to ""alternate"" story lines. I'm pretty sure it'll be 7 because 8 will likely be Leon as he is in every even numbered title. Where odd numbered titles with the exception of 3 are what we call ""Wesker"" titles."

residentevil,3bsuen,MrSomeBuuuDee,3,Wed Jul 1 21:33:30 2015 UTC,It's a very very good port. The inventory controls are a little wonk but you'll get used to it and pretty much every little thing can be reconfigured.
residentevil,3bsuen,NXMT,2,Fri Jul 3 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"It runs MT Framework, so it was built specifically to run well even on lower-end PCs from that time before being ported to consoles. The netcode is great, and it has FOV settings and button binds, which I don't think the console version had. Since it's on PC, you can also mod it, and the modding community is surprisingly active.  Basically, it's easily the best version."

residentevil,3bkgrs,JiveAssCracker,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:22:05 2015 UTC,Reload game? Maybe reload with controller plugged in.  If that doesn't work try using your controller to go to the in-game settings and see if there's an option to change your input method from controller to keyboard and mouse.
residentevil,3bjeim,SilentBobVG,5,Mon Jun 29 18:36:58 2015 UTC,Don't upgrade weapons you plan to sell for one thing. Also semi auto sniper and striker are two great guns. Broken butterfly is way better than the killer 7 but remember to only upgrade the capacity when it's empty. Gives you a free magazine of ammo.
residentevil,3bjeim,0beseninja,3,Mon Jun 29 19:26:16 2015 UTC,"I prefer to maintain solidarity in weapon types so that I always have ammo. I always go cold turkey until the Red9, then get the Striker ASAP so I can Ditman. I also collect all the free weapons I can for extra cash so that I can buy a rocket launcher before every boss."
residentevil,3bjeim,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:31:45 2015 UTC,Damn good strategy
residentevil,3bjeim,baconbacksunday,2,Mon Jun 29 22:25:59 2015 UTC,"I don't upgrade anything until the castle where Blacktail, Riot Gun, Semi Sniper become available.  Use stock weapons until then. Don't reload your TMP with anything but TMP ammo upgrades. Only reload the TMP with ammo when your TMP is fully upgraded. Most of the time you use the TMP for a quick shot to the head into melee combo anyway, so damage doesn't really matter. It also keeps you from wanting to spray and pray which is just a huge waste to do in that game.  People love the striker, but I find it useless because you get it too late in the game. The Riot Gun will get you through the entirety of the castle which is where the shotgun is most useful. Shield Ganados, those fly assholes, and lots of enemy swarms.   On the island your TMP is fully upgraded and you have so much ammo stockpiled you can just rambo your way through.  Killer 7 has the same advantage over Broken Butterfly that Riot Gun has over Striker. Broken Butterfly is worse than Killer 7 until its fully upgraded. It doesn't get fully upgraded until youre basically done with the game. So again, empirically it might be better, but you wont get good use out of it. Mind you, I dont really use the magnum much anyway.  Semi Auto rifle is just way better than the bolt action. It's versatility in firing allows you to better use it to kill the Giant Ganado, Claw Ganado(Sorry I forget all of the enemy names), and the Iron Maidens. You can pretty easily hit the Plaga's on IM's backs with the Semi Auto when you stagger them. It's much harder to do with the Bolt Action.  Handgun is really just preference. It's like TMP in which you just use it for tagging heads into melee combos. Red nine you get early on and it gives you the most damage per bullet. But it takes a lot of space. Blacktail is actually a pretty good boss killer because of its fire rate if you want to save ammo for other things. Or you can just buy Rocket Launchers before every boss."
residentevil,3bjeim,Ryndis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:56:04 2015 UTC,Red9 is my current playthrough's powerhouse and I am also a fan of the bolt-action rifle which I am using both this time around. Gotta know when and where you can use it though as the fire rate is really low and the reload speed is just as atrocious. However it is a wonderful gun that I am a huge fan of.  Classic shotgun as well. Although it feels rather lackluster in comparison to the other shotguns but I still enjoy it from time-to-time. Broken Butterfly IMO is the best magnum pre-new game+ so I just get the free one and stick with it. Also when you upgrade as other people mention don't do capacities unless you have empty/near empty clips or desperately need to as it saves ya some resources.
residentevil,3bjeim,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"I always prefer power above all else in my weapons so I always go with: Red 9, Riot Shotgun, SemiAuto Sniper (Okay, one exception), and Broken Butterfly.   I do make sure to secure the other guns and all treasure for selling purposes. I also never upgrade anything until I get the weapons I listed. Focus on the Red 9 first as you always get more pistol ammo. If you pick up everything and make sure to save your money for weapon upgrades you can almost fully upgrade everything before New Game+, even with getting the tactical vest."
residentevil,3bjeim,ThumbtackGlove,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:23:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to disagree with any mentions of the TMP and mine thrower. They are absolutely unnecessary in any walkthrough even on Professional. The kinds of ammo that drops depends on what you currently have on you. Having both TMP and pistol means you're just clogging up your inventory with twice the crap to do something your pistol does just fine. Even more so after your pistol has been tricked out. In some rare instances, certain places drop only TMP ammo but it's few and far between.  Striker is also largely popular but the range effectiveness turns me off completely. I personally would either go for the default shotgun or the Riot Gun as they have a decent range. The striker is only good when you're in melee range."
residentevil,3bjeim,NXMT,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:25:11 2015 UTC,When in doubt upgrade the shotgun.
residentevil,3bjeim,mistar_z,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:56:36 2015 UTC,"First off know what NOT to upgrade.  No need to upgrade any of the weapons during the village besides the TMP - they're powerful enough for what you'll encounter and you'll only sell them when you reach the castle, with the possible exception of the handgun you get from the medallion challenge (name escapes me right now).  TMP I'd recommend upgrading because it's actually very useful, especially ammo capacity. Saves so much ammo for your other weapons against trash mobs.  Same applies for the first magnum. Plenty powerful enough for the castle - only thing I would recommend if you're having trouble is upgrading magnum's ammo cap to refill it."
residentevil,3bjeim,Yukito_097,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:42:39 2015 UTC,"The tmp is the best weapon to upgrade since its got the most plentiful ammo supply so upgrading it only makes those bullets more efficient.  This also helps save shotgun shells for those bugs.  My general strategy for upgrading guns in re4 is to power up the weakest guns first (Tmp and Blacktail.)  The best weapons load out would depend on if you have access to infinite ammo weapons.  If so the go with the Thompson, infinite rocket launcher, and the semi auto rifle (maxed out.)  The best non infinite ammo loadout is the Blacktail, Tmp, Striker, Semi auto rifle, Broken butterfly, and Mine thrower.  This load out gives you access to all the different ammo types while still having (just enough) room for all the other things you need."
residentevil,3bjeim,kikaider007,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"Screw the TMP, it's a sack of shit imo. I just sell the ammo I do find for it. Means more ammo for the guns I do use drop from enemy mobs.  I'll buy the basic Rifle, upgrade that as and when upgrades unlock, sell the basic pistol and use the Blacktail, won't upgrade it because I'll sell it for the Red 9 when it comes out, that pistol is the best pistol in the game in my opinion, it hits hard, it's got a nice capacity, and the stock makes it deadly accurate. Depending on how I'm feeling I'll go for either the Riot Gun or the Striker, usually the Striker though for that mad capacity upgrade. And as for when to upgrade? I saved so much money from not upgrading the basic shotgun/pistol/blacktail that every time an upgrade became available, I could afford them. I think there may have been a point once or twice where I ran a bit low on cash, but by the time I got to the last boss I was drowning in ammo, and had enough Y+G+R herb that the last boss was a breeze.   I'll backtrack for the free Broken Butterfly in the Castle, and that's me. Always upgrade your ammo capacity on an empty/low clip though. Such an awesome thing to do with the Butterfly, you'll end up having lots of ammo by the end of the game. I only ever really break the Magnum out for Salazar's Verdugo. I killed the Salazar boss with my Rifle, wasn't any need for the Butterfly to be brought out haha. The 50.0 damage exclusive upgrade makes it a beast. Then again I do prefer my bolt action rifles to my automatics any day of the week.  Those are the weapons I'll use exclusively til I get the Chicago Typewriter.  EDIT I hope this goes without saying but never ever ever ever touch the Minethrower."

Plus it has Wesker and all of his badassness all in one place! And if you have the Mercenaries Reunion DLC you get Barry and Josh (both of whom are absolutely amazing as well) as well as other sorts of fun.  Aside from the mentions here I will bring up The Mercenaries 3D which never gets any attention. It is a great play and gives you a decent run for your money."

residentevil,3bj2xu,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:24:15 2015 UTC,"Because the reload exploit feels super-dirty. No reloading ever and RE5 gets trash-talked pretty frequently. I didn't mean it in a negative light as yes RE5 definitely kicks serious ass.  Well it is rather fun. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet but as it's on the 3DS platform it does have limitations. The game uses a combination of RE4 and RE5 mercenaries maps but they are slightly altered and smaller than their previous counterparts. It runs a skill system that allows you to pick things like extra damage, healing efficiency, etc. that level up the more you use them. Honestly it's a bunch of fun. I'm stuck on the EX level missions because everything pretty much owns you and overwhelms you but other than that: I'd say it's worth a play."
residentevil,3bj2xu,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"Still better than 4, which forces you to stop in place to sit and reload or pause the game to swap weapons. I think inventory reload only added to the game and kept up its pace, even if it almost completely mitigated any reason to upgrade a weapon's capacity and reload speed in the campaign; but I'm more than happy with Revs and 6 letting you move and shoot or reload. I'd say that's a fair compromise."
residentevil,3bj2xu,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:48 2015 UTC,"Well then I have some good news for you: Mercs 3D actually lets you reload as you're running! You still have to stand-shoot your targets but I have a feeling you'd love it regardless. I don't have an issue with the standing shooting or reloading myself since it creates a challenge in the game, but the whole pausing to change guns thing is, I agree, awful to deal with."

residentevil,3bkfbw,Nikolai_Roze,6,Mon Jun 29 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"Let's be real here, the original 3 games are the best in the series. Play them, by any means."
residentevil,3bkfbw,thedude2618,6,Mon Jun 29 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"RE 2, 3 and Remake maybe, but I wouldn't say the original three.  While the original RE 1 obviously started the series, it is very sub-par as a standalone game, even within the series. The existence of Remake has made the original RE 1 obsolete in pretty much every way."
residentevil,3bkfbw,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:02:56 2015 UTC,REmake is better than RE1 but it's a different game. I'd recommend anyone to play it.
residentevil,3bkfbw,thedude2618,3,Tue Jun 30 00:13:27 2015 UTC,"Rose colored goggles? The games are good sure but I've got serious doubts over how they stand up today. Its really the only reason why REmaster had a modern control scheme.  OP, if you've played zero before on a GC or Wii then I'd have to assume that you're ok with the classic controls. In which case, I'd also have to recommend going through the first 3 on the PS1. Almost all of the games feature a reoccurring character from them.  The numbered RE games are all worth picking up despite what people have to say about them. 6 in particular which has a nasty reputation for jumping the shark but is nonetheless still an excellent action game. 4 is considered a highlight for many for as it set the standard for all future games though I fear your prior experience with 5 may sully the experience a little. Revelations 1 and 2 are highly recommended and is considered a great throwback to the series' survival horror roots."
residentevil,3bkfbw,NXMT,2,Mon Jun 29 23:54:13 2015 UTC,I've recently finished four and can say I enjoyed it once I got used to the controls. I have not played five in so long that I can't remember it too well. Same goes for zero for the most part.   My only issue with emulators is that I've yet to find one that ports the controls to work properly with the Xbox controller I use. I've never been a fan of PlayStation controllers.

residentevil,3bggvp,Darkar123,3,Mon Jun 29 05:27:26 2015 UTC,"Outbreak remake online. No preset characters, you make your own character from scratch, choose one of a few dozen professions each with their own strengths and drawbacks, some do more melee damage, others can pick locks, or carry more items. Also stats could be adjusted, trade movement speed for an increase in damage or a higher luck at finding weapons/ammo.  Multiple play styles and gameplay options. Some goals are to scavenger and build fortifications while surviving against hordes of zombies, other goals are to simply escape and survive while others are to go and eliminate as many zombies as you can while searching for a key item.  Lots of very large maps of Raccoon City. So big that even if you're playing with other players, you may not even meet up with the other survivors.  Imagine this: You build a fast character who doesn't do much damage but makes up for it in speed. You choose a class bonus that allows you to carry extra items and you start a survivor game in Raccoon City. The goal is to survive until help arrives and you can be extracted. The time until extraction is random and can vary. You begin in a random place on the map just as the outbreak is at its worst. You're in the middle of the suburbs, the first thing you do is find somewhere to lay low. You go through houses picking off zombies, finding other survivors until you find an abandoned house to hide in. You make sure there aren't any zombies inside and you start foraging through the garage and house where you find nails and boards to barricade the doors. You can pick up and move furniture to further blockade yourself but it's not nearly enough. You have to go and scrounge through other houses in the neighborhood for supplies. Every action causes noise which can potentially draw attention to your location. You could move a car onto the porch of your house for a barricade but it'll be noiser than simply hammering. You have to venture further from your base each time looking for supplies and weapons. The best chance of weapons are in the big chain store or police station, but there's a higher risk of finding zombies there. You meet up with other survivors (players) and with combined efforts you can take on bigger hordes or gather supplies separately and find them twice as fast. With limited carry capacity, this will mean a lot of searching and traveling and an absolute necessity for co-op in order to best survive.  The maps are huge and every building and house can be entered. Some are locked, some might require a character with a higher agility (can jump higher) to get in through a window. Some characters can knock down doors and some have small frames and can fit through smaller openings and vents. Everyone brings their own thing to the table and working together will make the game easier."

residentevil,3bggvp,dischord76,2,Mon Jun 29 13:00:02 2015 UTC,I would set the game in raccoon city during RE2 and 3 since I feel like its a giant city there are probably countless stories to be told. It would be a new cast or maybe have Barry leading a group of survivors to the forests. Maybe stumble on some secret Umbrella compound that was in place to replace the mansion or find the hospital in outbreak.
residentevil,3bggvp,payne6,2,Mon Jun 29 14:50:05 2015 UTC,A remake of Survivor in the style of RE2 that makes it feature-length. A full release of the original N64 version of 0. RE7. Just RE7. Keep it like 6 with subtle improvements like 5 did with 4 because that ruled.   I don't trust myself to come up with an original idea without it becoming a full on stupid fanfiction that I'd regret sharing in t-minus five minutes.

residentevil,3bggvp,Darkar123,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:59:11 2015 UTC,"It'd be cool if they contrived some kind of outbreak that occurred before the mansion incident, while Wesker was working for Umbrella. Maybe a little one in a remote village so they could completely cover it up, or even one set entirely in an Umbrella lab. This would be cool because it would be the earliest moment in the RE timeline, and it would let you play as Wesker before he got all strong and stuff."
residentevil,3bggvp,chofortu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, an outbreak in a Lab from the perspective of a researcher or guard trying to escape.

Tradition's sake says to use Chris but frankly I'm sick of seeing him and he's one of the least interesting characters in the series. A few main characters would definitely bite the bullet. There would be a stalker type antagonist like Nemesis - perhaps a new version of the enemy. Create it like the old games but with the over the shoulder interface that has become common survival horror fare. Doubt this game would sell well if it followed the old formula, but W/E. Last thing I'd wanna see is another Wesker, though. I'd probably axe Chris in the first five minutes too. Most of the cast would probably bite the bullet by the end."

residentevil,3bgfbi,LexCrunch,2,Sat Jul 4 13:57:15 2015 UTC,"That will be a good week.  Also, Wesker is consistently the objective best character in Mercenaries by far. When he wasn't in 6, Jake took his spot as the best."
residentevil,3bgfbi,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Jul 4 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"This is definitely true. Although! My highest ever recorded score was with, believe it or not, BSAA Chris on Warehouse. Don't know how the hell I managed that one but it happened. 160k score or something damn close to it.   Also STARS Wesker best Wesker. I toss the magnum after using the rounds in it and just hold headshot > Cobra Strike rave parties all day then pull out Triple-H (Helena Harper Hydra) when shit gets real. Fell in love with the Mercs Reunion stuff too. Barry and Josh are just too fuckin' good! Sadly it's too bad you can't play them and Wesker at the same time."
residentevil,3bgfbi,LexCrunch,2,Sat Jul 4 18:00:15 2015 UTC,"Everyone in Reunion is broken. That's why the enemy configurations and scoring system are a bit more harsh. Just like with RE6, if you didn't full combo all 150 bad guys, then you've essentially lost.  Personally, I prefer STARS Chris and Battle Suit Jill, who were the two best characters that aren't Wesker. STARS Chris has the most fun:effective ratio to his loadout for me, and Jill has the Leg Grab > Double Knee Drop combo which never gets old. Quickscoping with the weapon switch trick was also a lot of fun. In Reunion, I like to go Excella and Business Sheva, who were the two best characters in Reunion as well, I think. Sheva's SIG sets up for Roundhouse kills in one shot, and Excella gets to make human bombs and Disco Spin all night. Fun stuff."
residentevil,3bgfbi,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Jul 4 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"Jill is damn effective against everything... Up until you face a Red Executioner. Her BSAA loadout is garbage town against them and most of my deaths with her are against them easily. At one point I played for six consecutive hours just breaking my left thumb stick trying to get out of grabs. Skinned my hand too because of how hard I worked that son of a bitch. It's tough being BSAA Jill in Prison.  Excella is, surprisingly, satisfying to melee-kill with. It's really silly how she can just pimp-slap her way to victory. When that doesn't work she can do doctor check-ups for extra lols. It actually surprises me that there hasn't been a mod to combine the character rosters into one or both Mercs mode yet (that I know of anyways)."
residentevil,3bgfbi,LexCrunch,2,Sat Jul 4 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"BSAA Jill is just trash, period. She has no power weapons with which to take care of boss monsters, and her Px4's critical hit power is only counterproductive since you're going for as many melee kills as possible. Everything about Battle Suit is a straight upgrade. I'd love to have that pistol in the campaign, though =(  Also, you can mash on the face buttons while wiggling the stick to get out of grabs way faster. The Majinis' faces don't even get to split open and give you a little damage."
residentevil,3bgfbi,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured that about the Majini moot grabbers as they aren't an issue. It's the Executioner grabs that I have trouble with. It seems damn near impossible to get out of those, which then leave you with a chance of ""whoops I hit the wrong combination of buttons so there goes five minutes of playing due to a cheap game mechanic"" syndrome. Seriously I don't even use that Fx4 pistol with her hardly: It's all about the MP5 life up in here. The gun is a beast! It's just a shame it has no knockback and eats bullets like no tomorrow."
residentevil,3bgfbi,LexCrunch,2,Sat Jul 4 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"It probably seems harder to escape executioner grabs because there's a minimum time you have to spend in the grab before you're allowed to escape it on your own. You should be able to get out fine with the same mashing you use on Majinis.  As for the MP5, it's okay. It has level 4 piercing which is cool, but not the most helpful of buffs. Its 120 damage output isn't much of an improvement over BS Jill's Skorpion which does 100, not that it matters much since BSAA Jill is still lacking a power weapon, and both versions and relies mostly on super powerful or insta-kill melee attacks anyway. STARS Chris still has the best MG with a whopping 160 damage."
residentevil,3bgfbi,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Jul 4 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"Right which is absolutely silly. IIRC she doesn't have this problem in Mercs 3D as the loadouts are fair (or at least that's how I feel on the matter). Plus you get skills you can attach to characters to balance out their weaknesses which is rather helpful in this gameplay style.  Also Claire is absolutely broken in that game. I love it!  I do like her MP5 though. Makes Villager Majini absolutely worthless behind shields and other people, and it stuns the larger assholes so you can kick their shit in. Quite good if you can lock them against a wall for combo'ing shenanigans."

I tried to full combo, but it dropped because of the stupid way it delays kill counts depending on how you kill things, and I really don't feel like running it again.

residentevil,3bgfbi,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Jul 4 13:18:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I felt pretty bad about that, but I had a project for school and a few commissions to work on all week, so I was really busy up until this point. Maybe we need to come up with a soft deadline for new entries or something.  We all set six-figure scores on different stages, too, so maybe we can negotiate a compromise in which everyone gets a title?"
residentevil,3bgfbi,JoeKrauzer,2,Sat Jul 4 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"I honestly think we should make our submissions anonymous up until the final day where we can see them but not submit afterwards, and if this system didn't work I think we should just limit our submissions to one per person. That way we don't have people camping on a challenge waiting for other people to pass their score just so they can resubmit an entry. I think this would be a fair method."
residentevil,3bgfbi,JoeKrauzer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"I was about to motion for an extension of the challenge to run in the background next week for all those who participated this week since me and my fellow yanks are surely going to be preoccupied for the 4th of July anyway. The anonymous one submission per person rule would actually probably be a really good idea to incorporate in future challenges.  I don't feel good about taking away /u/JoeKrauzer's opportunity like that, and if none of our proposed solutions pass, then I'll gladly retract my entry for the week."
residentevil,3bgfbi,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Jul 4 19:04:37 2015 UTC,"Eh. Honestly if yours won I wouldn't even be mad: It's pretty goddamn amazing to kill all 121 enemies in one chain so honestly whatever /u/chofortu decides I'm cool with.

residentevil,3bgfbi,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:09:29 2015 UTC,"I understand the feeling. I had a couple of runs which both of them ended up being me looking for enemies at the end. Waterworld is such a bitch to find people on after a majority of the time passes, and I ended up camping for too long on my submitted entry. I believe /u/LexCrunch found the perfect level to do this challenge on.  My problem with this level is that when I'd try this as Leon (first level I attempted after recently unlocking Mercenaries mode) I'd get gangbanged by arrows or randomly locked into a corner fighting for my life.   Leon's weakness: Zealot armies.   So bad."
residentevil,3bg4u9,coltthedog,7,Sun Jun 28 22:46:13 2015 UTC,"So think of it this way. Claire probably talked to Barry BECAUSE of the fact moira was there. Being as the BSAA is a organization to stop bio-terror they probably had to go through a process of trying to get the operation approved and everything (because sending in an army takes time and money). With Barry being Barry he probably was like ""This is taking too fucking long"" and did his own thing"
residentevil,3bg4u9,ripperc100jr,2,Mon Jun 29 00:01:12 2015 UTC,thats what i kind of thought but 6 months is way too long for the BSAA (much less Barry) to act on such a lead. They send agents in immediately as soon as the see a sign of crazy shit and here washes up claire who is literally injected with t-phobos

residentevil,3bg4u9,DrHoenybun,3,Wed Jul 1 01:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I noticed some of these things too. Another thing was at the end of Barry Episode 1, he is shocked to discover that the radio message was broadcast 6 months ago. This was a really cool reveal and I liked it, but after playing the rest of the game it's kind of silly. The player didn't know that Barry was following 6 months later, but Barry himself did so he shouldn't have been so shocked at this discovery. Not game-ruining or anything but just something I noticed."
residentevil,3bg4u9,DrHoenybun,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"It definitely seemed like they really went for ""this will be really dramatic"" over ""this will make sense"" in this game's Revelations"

residentevil,3bg4u9,News_Bot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:28:25 2015 UTC,"that doesnt explain why barry and claire were so slow to come back, along with why claire could get the BSAA to come"

residentevil,3bg4u9,News_Bot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:05:46 2015 UTC,that would be funny but bugging the BSAA with no success for 6 months doesnt seem at all like claire either
residentevil,3bg4u9,vaulthero,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:45:08 2015 UTC,I didn't say six months for her to get them to do something. I said she acted in six months I mean she probably had to recover heal build up strength. Them when the bsaa wasn't doing anything and Barry left on his own is when she got on the bsaa shit.
residentevil,3bg4u9,kikaider007,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:03:55 2015 UTC,"It's unknown when Barry found the distress call, but the BSAA received it before he did from a base near the island, and it was analyzed at BSAA HQ in London to get its location. Barry had to use ""forceful means"" to obtain it, since they weren't exactly throwing classified data to just anyone. Barry isn't an actual BSAA member, so his security clearance is very low. He rushed ahead while the BSAA prepared to assault the island.  Claire should be physically dead due to the jump she took into the sea. Falling into water at that height is not much better than concrete, and on top of that, she was drifting at sea until she was picked up by a boat elsewhere. Physical damage + exposure would put anyone in intensive care for months.  Barry is surprised by Uroboros because Claire never encountered it, so it wasn't in her debriefing. He knew about the Overseer because Moira mentions her in the distress call. Claire mentioned the virus in her report also. As for Claire arriving at the island, she obviously just got out of the ICU and decided to go to the island with the BSAA just as they were preparing for the assault.  There are no actual plot holes in the game as far as writing goes. There only appears to be because it's a video game and plot is secondary to gameplay, and there isn't enough time or room to fit in every little plot detail."
residentevil,3bg4u9,Airaku,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:06:51 2015 UTC,Claire's final boss is ouroboros and they make a big deal about it.
residentevil,3bg4u9,ErebusTotallus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:11:12 2015 UTC,"That was one enemy, which she no doubt mentioned. However, the island is teeming with Uroboros creatures after that battle because Alex spent the six month gap creating and releasing them. Barry wasn't prepared for them, hence his surprise."
residentevil,3bg4u9,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:12:35 2015 UTC,Barry still says that he's looking for moira AND claire more than once in chapters 2 and 3. He may do it in 4 but im not positive on that onw
residentevil,3bg4u9,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:26:35 2015 UTC,He doesn't. It's always just Moira. He never mentions needing to find Claire.

residentevil,3bg4u9,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:10:01 2015 UTC,Alex was totally loaded with money so she probably just hired mercenaries to do that one job.
residentevil,3bg4u9,News_Bot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:13:18 2015 UTC,"Barry wasn't on his own at all, he spearheaded the rescue mission that he put together after 6 months of searching for the Islands location.  Uroboros didn't take over the island until after Claire escaped."
residentevil,3bghgi,sublimei,3,Mon Jun 29 00:41:28 2015 UTC,"That would be cool to know, but I don't think there are any hints to be found, unfortunately.  In RE6, a handful of the secret files that you unlock in Jake's campaign chronicle the diary of the guy who would become Ustanak, as well as the medical journals kept by those monitoring his progress. I thought that was great to have in the game.  I'd also just like to say that your suspicion with Billy's arm tattoo is actually pretty cool, and if you'd shared that with me before I'd finished 0, then I would have been fully on board with your prediction."
residentevil,3bghgi,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, I must have missed that in RE6.

residentevil,3bghgi,darklordoftech,2,Mon Jun 29 04:48:37 2015 UTC,I've wondered about this too. My headcanon is that the T-002 is Wesker's ex and I'm betting that the majority are Umbrella employees who either volunteered or were imprisoned by their bosses and fellow employees. You'd think that the identities of the people who became the important B.O.W.s such as the T-002 and the Nemesis would come up.
residentevil,3bghgi,SilentBobVG,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:07:49 2015 UTC,http://residentevil.wikia.com/Nemesis-T_Type
residentevil,3bghgi,Zaeh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:32:37 2015 UTC,"I read that, it's very interesting. I was speaking more in terms of the human Nemesis formerly was. Who was he? Where was he from? How did Umbrella obtain him for experimentation? How did they train him?  I'm almost imaging some HUNK variant who is so down for Umbrella he volunteered."
residentevil,3bghgi,Zaeh,2,Mon Jun 29 01:40:13 2015 UTC,"He was just some dude, like the rest of the people who became Tyrants.  Before the stuff with Sergei that allowed them to raise the success rate of the whole Tyrant program, they went through a lot of test subjects to find someone who could become a tyrant. So they're not anyone of importance, just some unnamed test subjects."
residentevil,3bghgi,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:23:42 2015 UTC,"Ya, even if he was just some dude, still be cool to know who they were regardless. /u/LexCrunch mentioned the guy who became Ustanak keeping a diary (revealed in secret files unlocked in Jake's campaign) which led me to this which is what I believe he was talking about. The guy was an Umbrella scientist whose blood bonded very well with the C-Virus so he volunteered. He also seemed to be infatuated or even in love with Dr. Carla Radames.  Was Nemesis a volunteer? Kidnapped? Tricked into undergoing experimentation? Did he work for Umbrella? A former S.T.A.R.S. or RPD member?   I'm mostly interested in the volunteering or by force aspect. Like, are these ""some dudes"" human trafficking victims or what?"
residentevil,3bghgi,Zaeh,2,Mon Jun 29 02:29:28 2015 UTC,"Considering the sheer amount of test subjects they went through, I'd say that none of them were volunteers, and most kidnapped or got through other means of human trafficking."
residentevil,3bghgi,News_Bot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:31:37 2015 UTC,"There is a collection of files that you can find throughout Survivor which I found genuinely chilling that suggest human trafficking.  They were all about kidnapping and collecting pubescent teenagers and young adults from around the world and bringing them to Sheena Island to harvest a brain chemical that influences their sex drive since they produce much more of it than other people. It also mentions that the subjects have to be fully awake during the extraction process that usually kills them, and they can't be given anesthetics since their fear produces even more of the chemical.  The Umbrella scientists used their sexy chemicals to make the tyrant from the end of the game, which is why it looks like a lanky high school kid the first time you fight it."
residentevil,3bghgi,purpldevl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:45:32 2015 UTC,"That's just in terms of what they were doing at Sheena Island though, trying to improve the Tyrants, if I remember correctly.  The chemical that they were, well, ""harvesting"", was used just to improve Tyrants, and for the Hypnos Tyrant. The regular Tyrants were made with T-Virus, after going through a lot test subjects to see who it would work on, long before the mass production facility on Sheena Island was set up."
residentevil,3bghgi,News_Bot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:50:05 2015 UTC,"The chemical extracted on Sheena Island was exclusively for the purpose of creating the Hypnos-T Type. In the series universe, the chemical was linked to aggression, so the theory was that administering significantly huge amounts of it during the a B.OW. gene culture process would create a much more aggressive B.O.W. Since the Tyrant was the company's best product, they chose it as the first test subject."
residentevil,3bghgi,News_Bot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:57:01 2015 UTC,"I thought official sources had stated that the Nemesis was one of a few, that were basically T-103 Tyrants who had been injected with the Nemesis parasite... and that the T-103 models were all bio-engineered clones..."
residentevil,3bghgi,News_Bot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:35:55 2015 UTC,"The Nemesis-T Type is nobody.  Specifically, he is technically the same human who became the T-002, who was simply an unnamed male prisoner with good physical and immune strength. The T-103 was a genetic clone of the T-002 with further improvements, and the Nemesis-T Type is a T-103 injected with the Nemesis parasite."
residentevil,3bghgi,darklordoftech,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:55:11 2015 UTC,So a human trafficking victim? So where do they get these people? /u/LexCrunch pointed out Ustanak was an Umbrella scientist turned volunteer. Could it be possible Nemesis was a volunteer?
residentevil,3bghgi,chofortu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:02:37 2015 UTC,"Human trafficking is what it would be, yes. Umbrella also used homeless people as test subjects too, some of them became the first Hunters before they realized that experimenting on a human ovum was more efficient. The four Tyrant test subjects were prisoners, so it was not voluntary by any stretch.  Ustanak was a Neo Umbrella scientist, not Umbrella."
residentevil,3bghgi,chofortu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:10:56 2015 UTC,"Prisoners? From the American Prison Industrial Complex or prisoners, as in, people Umbrella kidnapped?  I thought hunters were amphibians, not human."
residentevil,3bghgi,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:36:38 2015 UTC,"It's not specified.  Hunters are humans with reptilian or amphibian genes depending on the model, using the t-Virus as a retroviral vector to transport those genes. Initially they just injected grown people with it, but eventually switched to injecting a human ovum."
residentevil,3bghgi,chofortu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:38:55 2015 UTC,"I asked because if they were getting prisoners from the U.S. government, then we have a whole new level of fucked up. Thank you for your input."
residentevil,3bghgi,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:53:23 2015 UTC,"I'm betting that the ""prisoners"" are their own employees. Would they really bother kidnapping random people when they have so many employees under their grasp?"

It looks more like a neat proof of concept for an original idea to come later than an actual fun or interesting game on its own.  All the enemies stumble around after every shot for some reason, so it looks like as long as you're somehow able to see them in the complete darkness, they're pretty much your bitch. All of the modern abilities that you're given to play through an unchanged map also reminds me too much of how unbalanced and stupid Twin Snakes was.  Nearly all of the animations and visual assets are also ripped directly from Darkside Chronicles, too, so unless they're being used as a basis for a complete remodeling, then there's really nothing new to see here, assuming you can see anything at all with how dark it is."

Get the Red9 ASAP. It's far and away the most powerful handgun, and comes with a stock to also make it the most accurate.

residentevil,3b7zgq,theowest,2,Fri Jun 26 22:37:14 2015 UTC,I've never liked anything other than the standard handgun. Maxed is the best thing ever imo. Especially when I got RE4 for the Wii and headshots were extremely easy to pull off. The 5x crit is way better than the extra damage.
residentevil,3b7zgq,Laalipop,4,Fri Jun 26 21:11:58 2015 UTC,"It's awesome against standard enemies, but it's worthless against plagas or anything that you can't critical headshot. Plus, why go for headshots and cross your fingers with the handgun when you can just put three to the chest with the red9?"
residentevil,3b7zgq,Mediocre_george,4,Fri Jun 26 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"The chance of 1 bullet spent > 3 is worth it in my book. And regardless there is nothing more satisfying than 3 heads popping off one right after another, using it on the Wii Version instead of a Rifle to guard Ashley right before she gets captured in the castle the first time was also fun. I missed that 5x crit rate in RE5 so much."
residentevil,3b7zgq,Laalipop,2,Fri Jun 26 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"RE4 does this thing where the bad guys only ever drop ammo for guns that you own, and are several times more likely to drop ammo for a gun that's running dry. You never really have to worry about ammo as long as you're only carrying one or two classes of weapons.  The high crit rate is still really fun, though, I will admit."
residentevil,3b7zgq,LexCrunch,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"The critical percentage applies when shooting plagas. It also gives the knife the same properties as well, assuming you can slash the enemy's head (not too difficult when baiting a single ganado into attacking).  Besides, if you're facing groups or the tougher B.O.W.s, it's time to put the handgun back in the case and pull out something bigger anyway."
residentevil,3b7zgq,Knight_Doppler,2,Sat Jun 27 06:40:44 2015 UTC,"That crit chance only applies to the ganados, which die in anywhere from one to three shots from the maxed out Red9 anyway, depending on which kind you're fighting. Leon's pop gun is definitely really fun to use, but its better RNG by no means outclasses the Red9's consistent raw power since that applies to every enemy in the game.  To compare, fully upgraded it takes four shots with the Red9 to open up El Gigante's weak point, and then three shots to the weak spot to kill; whereas the starter gun takes closer to fifteen shots to open him up, and something like eight to kill. Against anything besides ganados, the starting handgun is pretty useless, and even then, some of the bad guys wear helmets to completely negate its strength."
residentevil,3b7zgq,LexCrunch,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"I admit the Red9 is by far the best pistol, but the standard handgun is still my favorite and most used pistol.  Nothing beats the feeling of getting all those one shots to the head."

residentevil,3b7zgq,Ryndis,3,Fri Jun 26 21:28:22 2015 UTC,"That, the faster reload and firing speed makes up for the less firepower IMO. 1.6 fewer firepower points to be exact."
residentevil,3b7zgq,theowest,3,Fri Jun 26 22:44:54 2015 UTC,Yeah the low Firing Speed of Red Nine just kills it for me. That being said I hardly use the handgun after I get Riot Gun anyway. Every time I've beaten that game I'm swimming in TMP/Shotgun ammo anyway. Abusing reloads from ammo upgrades just makes the game so easy.
residentevil,3b7zgq,Ryndis,0,Fri Jun 26 22:56:44 2015 UTC,Use Ditman and all your problems are solved.
residentevil,3b7zgq,LexCrunch,3,Fri Jun 26 23:33:14 2015 UTC,I dont know what that is and it doesn't change the fact the handgun becomes almost completely obsolete by the time you get to the castle. And is a shitload of inventory space.
residentevil,3b7zgq,Ryndis,2,Sat Jun 27 00:37:54 2015 UTC,Depends on how many weapons you are carrying then I'd agree with you. I believe I managed to carry mine rather easily along with the Rifle and another weapon. Max carry case allows for some breathing room for misc. things as well as the weapons themselves.
residentevil,3b7zgq,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:16:41 2015 UTC,"Well with the way I play I start the Island with over 1000 TMP Ammo, so my inventory is always incredibly full."
residentevil,3b7zgq,Ryndis,3,Sat Jun 27 20:24:34 2015 UTC,I suppose. I don't generally use the TMP myself so my inventory has some breathing room. I getcha though. So much ammo to be found for that gun it's crazy.
residentevil,3b7zgq,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Jun 27 20:29:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, TMP ammo drops even if you don't have the gun pretty often so there isn't really a point in not having it. I don't actually use the TMP ammo i horde until the gun has its damage fully upgraded so I get the most damage for all of the ammo. Before that I just drain the gun with headshot/melee combo's and only reload it with upgrades. Saves a fuckload of ammo throughout the game and makes it so I basically dont need a handgun ever."
residentevil,3b7zgq,Ryndis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:57:21 2015 UTC,Even then I was able to handle the Red9 pretty easily without Ditman. It's just a bit different than the conventional handguns we see in RE4.

residentevil,3b7zgq,FagFortune,2,Fri Jun 26 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"Red9 is considered the best handgun. The ONLY perk to the punisher is that it can be effective against groups, thereby sometimes being usable in place of a shotgun."

residentevil,3b4pcw,KirbyStyle,2,Sun Jun 28 02:38:52 2015 UTC,Umbrella Chronicles? I guess by that token though It also showed the opposite scenario in the 2nd one.
residentevil,3b4pcw,News_Bot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:15:37 2015 UTC,"It's all four.  Darkside Chronicles and Archives say Leon canonically met Marvin and Kendo. Happens only in Leon A. Degeneration shows that Claire fought G-Birkin's first form which happens only in Claire B. On top of that, the game's director Hideki Kamiya outright stated that all four are canon.    Q3. ""Leon A & Claire B"" and ""Claire A & Leon B."" Which scenario combination could be considered the true one?  A3. Both of them, of course. To digress, we really wanted to show off the merits of the zapping system, so we cut out elements of diversion from this game. We did this because by having 4 different zapping story scenarios, we felt that players would have to play through the branching story a number of times in order to see everything. Should players have time, it would be interesting to see where things differ among scenarios.   It is never stated ANYWHERE that only Claire A/Leon B are canon. This is nothing but an assumption based on the fact that major events from those two happen to be canon too. But this was going to happen regardless because you can't have two of the same events occurring at the same time. They had to pick. But just because they chose those particular events doesn't mean the entire opposite scenarios were negated.  Leon taking the pendant sample from Ada's body and throwing it away is stated in Wesker's Report but never actually shown in Leon B. That's because it's a borrowed and tweaked event from Leon A where he took the sample from Annette and threw it away, and the director already stated that certain things happened that weren't actually written or given scenes in the game.   Q23. In the ending of Leon's A scenario, how did Sherry know him?  A23. We never drew it in the scenario, but there must have been a conversation with Leon and Sherry since they didn't encounter each other until the freight train departed. In other words, Claire must have escaped from the laboratory along with Leon and told Sherry the story about this man."
residentevil,3b4pcw,llamasq,2,Fri Jun 26 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"Disagree with me if you want, but I don't think the Chronicles games are a good basis on choosing what is canon. The scenarios are all just butchered versions of the original games.  But true facts about Degeneration's little flashback to Birkin. Totally forgot about it (though didn't she see Birkin's first form when he throws a pipe at her before he transforms in Claire A? I'm gonna have to recheck that). I just thought the community widely regarded ClaireA/LeonB as the true canon since the major evens that transpired in those carry over to other games."

residentevil,3b4pcw,bitterberriescomics,2,Sun Jun 28 03:36:48 2015 UTC,"News_Bot is correct. The full story is a combination  of all 4 scenarios. Just like the full story of RE 1 is a combination of both scenarios. To get the full story you have to read between the lines. Claire A/Leon B is the most accepted canon by fans, because most of its story elements are ones that showed up in later titles, however aspects from Leon A/Claire B do pop up from time to time. Also, Ada has a chapter in Umbrella Chronicles that shows her escape from the city."

There is little keeping you from creating an account and editing a real wikipedia article right this second, it's that it's pretty much pointless because wikipedia archives every version of the page and with enough moderators on staff checking edits, couple with a report system and an automated system that monitors highly trafficked/edited pages, the long term effects are negligible.  It's only with smaller wikis that edits stick around for awhile. The benefits of making a wiki editable by anyone far outweigh these minor setbacks.

Basically, you use an emulator to make a really long macro that beats the game more efficiently than a human possibly could.  To exploit the critical hits in a TAS just means that you find the exact moment in time that the pistol would get a crit, and program the macro to use it then since the critical hits are on a constantly spinning roulette.  It's practically impossible to actually exploit random crits in RE in real time, but it's pretty funny to watch in a TAS.  Here's the video I was talking about, by the way."

residentevil,3aujbv,Gmundy,6,Tue Jun 23 20:11:48 2015 UTC,I miss Billy so much... I loved him as a character and thought he looked awesome. I am so sad that we haven't heard from him again. Hope they'll bring him and Rebecca in a co-op game or something... They can call it Zero-2!... ... okay I'm not creative.
residentevil,3aujbv,Nikedawg,2,Wed Jun 24 03:11:54 2015 UTC,"I like Billy but I guess I didn't include him because you know, Billy seems like someone who knows her way around survival. But Rebecca, being the slightly innocent, naive girl that she is, I'm genuinely curious as to what happened to her.   I mean, it would be awesome to see her return in the canon series and have at least developed combat skills. It's so unfortunate that she got dropped off because she was honestly the first batch of RE crew along with Chris, Jill, Claire and Barry.   I probably consider RE0-RE2 the period where these characters comprised of the main RE series. Anything beyond that was pretty much ... meh. I mentioned Sheva and Helena because they were both portrayed as capable women and it'd be sad to think the developers of RE decides to kill them off screen.   I'm not worried about Ada because Ada always finds her way and she's been in half of the series with great influence. So the ones that I'm rather concerned with is Rebecca mostly."

First time playing the series(besides revelations on 3ds, completely lost on what was going on in the story), I played the original on my PSP for a bit got up to the part with the plant that's protecting crest. Tank controls killed me, quickly adapted though. But after starting the HD version, I don't think I could go back.   With all that being said, I hope the remake 2 & 3.

I recommend just starting the whole episode new and watching out not to get taken down again.   If its the latter I'd say completely uninstall everything and reinstalling but you might have to completely start anew if you delete saves etc too so i'd try that last. I have the complete version on steam and it installs everything so I can only guess  E: If you happen to have to delete everything install every extra right off the start this time

residentevil,3aga5k,GILLHUHN,2,Sat Jun 20 20:24:31 2015 UTC,"I would have gladly picked up ORC with a heavy discount. Either way, I'm having a great time with Revelations 2."
residentevil,3aga5k,NXMT,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:32:22 2015 UTC,"The only reason why Operation Racoon City is not on discount is because it is still using GFWL DRM and as long as it's not going to be transferred over to Steamworks, it will be never be discounted."
residentevil,3aga5k,Prah2013,0,Sat Jun 20 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"I dislike that the extra episodes are not on sale compared to episode 1. I wanted to just pick up ep 2 3 & 4 but now i have to purchase the entire package to get it all. Granted i get the extra stuff, but i didn't want all of that shit"
residentevil,3aga5k,ripperc100jr,0,Sat Jun 20 01:40:10 2015 UTC,Yea that sucks that the other episodes are not on sale. The package doesn't even come with the GOOD extra stuff like the Throwback Map Pack and Albert Wesker. smh Capcom
residentevil,3aht4c,raynehk14,2,Sat Jun 20 08:37:31 2015 UTC,"It's alright, but it's obviously a very different game for player two.  Flash light adventure or point at stuff adventure.  If you have a friend that's savvy to speed running or something along those lines, could be thoroughly enjoyable."
residentevil,3aht4c,DM_,2,Sat Jun 20 13:41:14 2015 UTC,Is its split screen coop or can I play over the Internet with a friend?
residentevil,3aht4c,mash3735,2,Sat Jun 20 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"split screen for campaign, online for Raid Mode."
residentevil,3aht4c,SilentBobVG,2,Sat Jun 20 17:29:43 2015 UTC,Thanks. I wish they implemented online coop. I have Noone to play with split screen.
residentevil,3aht4c,mash3735,2,Sat Jun 20 17:35:40 2015 UTC,"It's not like RE5. it's not a very competitive buddy game where you can compete who gets more kills, better accuracy and a higher scores. It's more of a gamer+casualgamer coop type. let's say you and your gf or little sister. or if you have a friend who enjoys playing support like I do. It's a fun single player tho (except on barry's episode 3, it's so dragged out if you played in single player)"
residentevil,3afzki,Eyedoless,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:53:06 2015 UTC,"I've done what you're about to do, the Collectors edition is amazing.  The ONLY difference between the two games is Cross vs. Circle.  In the west, we tend to use Cross as the confirm button, Japan uses the Circle.  You cannot remap it in the game itself.  (I've heard there might be a way to do it via ps4 options, but I've never tried.)  It's kind of maddening but you get used to it after awhile."
residentevil,3afzki,DM_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:42:44 2015 UTC,Why do you need an import if the game is already localized in English?
residentevil,3afzki,LexCrunch,3,Fri Jun 19 22:51:30 2015 UTC,I'm a collector so I buy physical copies.
residentevil,3af6x9,stak640,4,Fri Jun 19 17:10:51 2015 UTC,"Daily Deal so it's only for 48 hours.  Resident Evil 6, 4, and Revelations 1 @ new lowest ever prices. The rest it seems are @ or just around previous low prices - except for Raccoon City (which isn't on sale at all)."
residentevil,3af6x9,LexCrunch,3,Fri Jun 19 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"I already own all of these. Unfortunately, that also includes O:RC."

The regular listing is $8 more but the only difference in the description is that it comes with Wesker and a RAID mode stage pack? Is that true? If I don't own ANY content for this game yet, which one am I supposed to get?"
residentevil,3af6x9,DudeLongcouch,2,Fri Jun 19 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"Correct - the regular one just has Hunk - the complete season one has Hunk in Raid Mode, Wesker in Raid Mode and more maps for Raid Mode. It's up to you - I bought the one with only Hunk - but got the Raid Mode bonus maps for pre-ordering. I don't mind not having Wesker.  If you're not gonna play Raid Mode at all - go for the cheapest. If you are, I can't really answer for you."

residentevil,3agn55,kikaider007,2,Sat Jun 20 00:17:20 2015 UTC,"The island was in the Baltic Sea and only the BSAA had authorization to be there.   Prior to the game's events, Natalia was also already in the custody of TerraSave, an NGO known for protests and appeals to the International Criminal Court. Had the government attempted to take Natalia away, they would've kicked up a storm. That wouldn't have happened for Sherry thanks to Simmons being lenient and allowing Claire to visit her, and also the whole threat of making Claire herself just disappear."
residentevil,3agn55,News_Bot,2,Sun Jun 21 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"It could be that Claire /wanted/ Sherry to go into custody, or maybe Barry's keeping the Natalia's involvement with the island a secret to protect her."
residentevil,3agn55,Yukito_097,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:53:22 2015 UTC,"Keeping her secret would be a tall order even for Barry.  At the end of RE2, Claire actually leaves Leon and Sherry before the gov't got to them.  But Sherry going into custody was to keep her from Wesker."

residentevil,3agn55,iPickled,2,Sun Jun 21 00:42:42 2015 UTC,Yea thats one way to think about it. Maybe the Canadian gov sent Barry to get the virus and bring it back to the mother land for world domination.

residentevil,3agn55,UEH,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:04:17 2015 UTC,"Good point, the US would do what they want.  It would be interesting to have something like this added to the story.

residentevil,3agn55,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:21:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, Natalia has two grown adults who are also agents for anti-bioterror organizations, so it's not like she's just let loose."

I would thoroughly enjoy your video more if you fixed your audio a little though. It's a little hard to hear you. Why did you pick the DS version as the ""default"" display instead of the original PS1 one?"
residentevil,3aezak,EQUASHNZRKUL,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:35:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! What would help worth the audio? Do I need to turn down the background music, or up the vocals, or both?  I chose the DS version because I found it interesting to see the improved 3d models out had to offer over the ps1 originals, although this meant a noticeably lower background resolution. Also, there are already loads of videos of upscaled ps1 graphics, but not so many of the DS one. Good question!"

residentevil,3acyjq,JoeKrauzer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:44:40 2015 UTC,"The d-pad hurts my thumb after a minute of use, the stiff analog stick makes half of the games uncomfortable to control, the tiny c-stick is a pain to use with any precision, the Z button makes no sense, and the shoulder buttons are simply awful to use with any game that doesn't take advantage of their analog design.  It's nothing short of frustrating trying to play RE on that thing. It works great for Smash Bros Melee, though."

residentevil,3a516h,EQUASHNZRKUL,5,Wed Jun 17 07:39:39 2015 UTC,How similar does it feel to the REmaster? Have they changed the engine or graphics at all? Or does it seem to be the same as REmaster?
residentevil,3a516h,LexCrunch,3,Wed Jun 17 08:51:46 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't played REmaster. I have played REmake, and RE0. It controls identically to RE0, and the graphics are improved in the ways I've described - 3D models of characters and enemies and items etc have been updated and their textures improved. I can't imagine it's more like REmaster than RE0 in how it plays, though."
residentevil,3a516h,RecklessBuster,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:18:27 2015 UTC,"If you're just asking how 0 handles compared to REmake, then I can tell you that movement is actually more sluggish in several small ways that feel like they were implemented just to make the enemy AI less exploitable. You also climb stairs much more slowly and there's no trick to get around it this time.  I can't imagine something like that being altered in a remastered port, but now I'm curious as to whether or not the modern control scheme bypasses the noticeably sluggish movement in any way to give even more of a mechanical advantage than it did before.  EDIT: Just from looking at the most recent gameplay video, it looks like it does."
residentevil,3a516h,Zaeh,2,Wed Jun 17 16:53:45 2015 UTC,Unlike on the previous PS controllers the PS4 controller has some decent triggers so i'm surprised they've not put aim+fire on L2 and R2 instead of the standard L1+R1.  Edit: It works perfectly fine on RE:Revelations2.
residentevil,3a516h,spleensoft,2,Wed Jun 17 10:42:14 2015 UTC,"That was still very in-progress, I'd assume.  Remake HD ditched the old video files and there's no reason Zero HD wouldn't."
residentevil,3a516h,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:21:14 2015 UTC,"Not all of them. In REmake HD, all of the pre-rendered cutscenes are very obvious SD, first noticeable in the pre-rendered scene of a corpse sitting up on a table before the title screen.  This seems so lazy, especially since they changed the lighting engine, so scenes in the same location look very different, and the inherent softness of the scenes does not upscale well. This is very obvious when draining/filling the pond."

residentevil,3a30dx,Obcydian,2,Wed Jun 17 18:21:38 2015 UTC,Ask for whether if they're going to be making any more significant changes to the game (the coop controversy or adding item boxes) or are they keeping the same strict 'you don't mess with a masterpiece' philosophy like with Remake HD.

residentevil,3a0arl,wrathborne,10,Tue Jun 16 05:44:46 2015 UTC,"As of right now, I would be sad. I feel like Capcom is FINALLY listening to what the fans want. We are in an RE renaissance. We got REmaster and REvelations 2 (two good games) for amazing prices. Capcom announced a RE0 remaster and I am almost certain we will see a remade RE2 in the future. Finally, I think years of fan begging for it will pay off as soon as Capcom has the finance.    To be clear, I don't want an RE7. I'm glad Capcom is staying in the past. They can take as long as they want before going forward with the series, I will be perfectly okay with that. If we get a remastered RE2, RE3, and CVX, I couldn't give a shit what they do after that. I think RE6 jumped the shark so far in terms of ridiculousness, that the series is unrecoverable from that point on. In my opinion anything taking place after RE6 will be pure ass.    On that note I'd like to give a big fuck you to Paul WS Anderson and his inexplicably well earning RE films. Before those piles of money sucking dick we didn't have things like clones or worldwide viruses or laser tunnels that have been shoved down our throats 3 fucking games now. I partially blame him for the unrecoverable death of my beloved series. I think he set an example that naive greedy Capcom tried to incorporate into games with disastrous results.    Oh and more CGI movies please."
residentevil,3a0arl,The_Naked_Snake,2,Tue Jun 16 06:46:54 2015 UTC,"CGI films are a different breed of crap on their own. I'm thinking this is partially due to Japanese story telling but mostly bad screenwriting.  The CGI films have yet to create characters I can emphasize with. I know nothing about Leon other than hes a government agent who makes ladies swoon when he isn't fighting monsters. He's got no real depth as a person and doesn't seem to be doing anything but fighting monsters or flirting.  Dudes gotta have hobbies, an emotional void, a love life, hell even a political belief would be nice. The just don't seem to let these characters actually be people, they're never far removed from the video games and that isn't a good thing for a movie.  Knowing what makes someone happy, scared, what their passion is, what they hate, their family life, even their personal problems is what makes them human. This is a must for any screenplay, and I saw damn near none of this in Degeneration(Claire had a little, but not much).  I didn't bother with Damnation because I wasn't interested in it. Capcom really blew their first opportunity to make something great with Degeneration and I didn't think they would really improve on Damnation."
residentevil,3a0arl,The_Naked_Snake,5,Tue Jun 16 06:55:48 2015 UTC,Hey don't get me wrong...they aren't Oscar gems but they ARE pure fan service that at least doesn't shit on the universe. The fact they don't try to introduce new monsters or anything is something I like despite the lack of character development.
residentevil,3a0arl,The_Naked_Snake,2,Tue Jun 16 06:59:25 2015 UTC,"Its fine, at least the characters are pretty much the same characters from the games and not B and Z grade actors and actresses playing caricatures who happen to share the same name as the game characters."
residentevil,3a0arl,Kirbyoto,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:01:41 2015 UTC,"That's the biggest difference for me. The live actions films are a disgrace. The CGI films are harmless, even if (and I totally agree with you) they don't contribute anything new or build on characters."
residentevil,3a0arl,chofortu,6,Tue Jun 16 07:06:20 2015 UTC,"even a political belief would be nice   Leon's political belief is that he loves America and trusts the government, as opposed to Chris, who's more cynical about it:   ""I'm just a realist, It's a capitalist society. Not everyone's cut out for that kind of constant pressure. Sure, there are opportunities to be had, but at what price? You gain, someone else loses.""   Plus, you know about Leon's love life - he's obsessed with Ada to the point where he can't actually be with any other woman. And in Damnation specifically, you get the only indication that they've actually gone out at least once (according to the director, they had a one-night stand and Ada was gone in the morning).  Although you are absolutely right about the fact that these characters don't bother to express fear - RE is definitely an ""action"" franchise now, it's just one that happens to have monsters in it."
residentevil,3a0arl,ripperc100jr,4,Tue Jun 16 13:46:51 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about replaying the newer games vs the old ones - I have no real interest in replaying Rev2, but I could happily plough through one of the first three or four games, no problem. I do wonder whether it's more to do with nostalgia than an actual disparity of quality - it's not something that's particularly easy to quantify. Things like ""charm"" do seem to be correlated with nostalgic experiences, though"
residentevil,3a0arl,LexCrunch,3,Tue Jun 16 05:53:50 2015 UTC,"I don't care. I got my old games that i'm happy with. Granted i would be sad because the series is gone, but it was dying a slow and painful death"

residentevil,3a0arl,Kirbyoto,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:21:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't want Capcom to stop making Resident Evil games, but I don't want the series to continue. By that I mean that the more the series moves forward in time, the less interesting it becomes. In Resident Evil, many of the STARS team are already dead at the start of the game and very few characters survive. It's a story of survival in incredibly hostile conditions. RE2 introduced new characters and ramped up the scale of the threat. Even 3, though the protagonist was recycled from the first game and the game was a little more action oriented, increased the danger to the protagonist even more to retain the feeling of vulnerability. For me, by CV the trademark atmosphere of the series up to that point was somewhat diluted. By bringing back characters from the previous games again to a similar situation in a new setting, the development team started to make the universe feel a little small, and the characters feel equipped with plot armour. That feeling only increases with each iteration of the series, when the same small group of people end up in the same situation and manage to survive. What I'm getting at is that while many argue that the new gameplay introduced in RE4 fundamentally changed the series, I think it's the actual overarching plot that has changed the tone of the games most.  So, if I don't want to see a Resident Evil 7 (or at least not unless the cast are new, inexperienced characters with the odds very much against them) then what do I want? Well, a remake of RE2, given the same care and attention as REmake, would be a great start. Maybe some kind of spiritual successor to Outbreak could be interesting. I also thought that Operation Raccoon City was a good idea, on paper. In the hands of a better development team a non-cannon game or a game that offers a different perspective on events we've already seen could be super interesting. I'm not sure I want to go back to tank controls or anything but I'd really appreciate a shift back in focus from action to survival again. Even combat in RE4 had an urgency to it that is just absent from the latest games."
residentevil,3a0arl,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Tue Jun 16 11:14:01 2015 UTC,"I definitely don't want Capcom to stop making Resident Evil games, but I don't want the series to continue.   One of the things that really bothered me about RE6 was that it makes the entire series just feel hopeless. I mean, that's the nature of a conflict-driven story, but it's like ""oh, hey, you got rid of Wesker and Tricell and Umbrella? Well, here's a secret government conspiracy, and here's NEO-Umbrella, and here's Chris going crazy because he lost his men, and here's a town being gassed, and here's a city being gassed, and it's never going to stop.""  It's so funny to me that RE5's ""arc"" is that Chris starts off jaded and frustrated, but ends up hopeful that someday things will be better, and RE6 makes it explicitly clear that it will NEVER be better - because if it was, there'd be no reason for more games.  Anyways, I think there's enough ""regular"" outbreaks in the RE world that they should just make games about the BSAA."
residentevil,3a0arl,Kirbyoto,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:40:30 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely be okay with a BSAA Chronicles of some kind! There's enough conflict in the world that they could easily make other side stories with new characters and new enemies. Easily.  As for the ""hopelessness"" that RE6 portrays I feel it is a fair message to give. It just goes to show that no matter how much good you do there will always be an equivalent evil. Chris ends RE5 on the, ""Is it worth fighting? I believe so."" and going into RE6 he overcomes the doubt that eats at him. Lots of people say it's a ridiculous part of the story but honestly to me this gives the hulking man some character. He's not a superhero. He's only human, so having human emotions and issues would make sense."
residentevil,3a0arl,Kirbyoto,0,Tue Jun 16 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"and going into RE6 he overcomes the doubt that eats at him   The problem to me is that RE6's particular issues feel very contrived. RE5 makes sense because we knew Wesker's tooling around somewhere, and we knew some other corporation is helping him. When they get taken down, there's a sense of closure.  In RE6, a bunch of new characters appear out of nowhere, with no precedent, and start wiping out cities. It feels kind of arbitrary. I mean, of course there's always going to be outbreaks and terrorism in the RE world, but there's a difference between a local warlord getting their hands on Hunters or whatever and ""secret government super-conspiracy almost destroys the world AGAIN""."
residentevil,3a0arl,thedude2618,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:15:45 2015 UTC,New characters appearing is a natural byproduct of the mainstays being part of large bureaucracies

Carla & Derek don't have any precedent, which is weird in a setting that's full of ""other evil companies"" lurking around.

I, like many, want a RE2 remake in the style of REmake but I don't think Capcom will invest the money into it over making RE7/Revelations 3. The reason is the more recent games appeal more to the casual gamer over the 'classic' RE style which resonates primarily with 'old school' RE fans.  I don't blame Capcom for churning out games that sell well and are critically average over games that don't sell as well but are critically well-received, they are a business after all."

But yes, I at least want some kind of finale story, then it does that cliche type thing at the end of movies where it goes like ""Bla bla finally did that thing, they are now doing bla bla."" Though I swear they did that in Revelations 1 already BUT I don't care, I need just some closure. And if it were to end, I'd really love it to end next year at least. 20 years of a series, and I might only have been in love with the series for the past 10-ish years, but I feel like I've grown up with Resi, maybe in the ""crappy demise"" era, but again, I have enjoyed all of the modern RE games.

If you want a higher res than that, like 4K or something, your only option would be to use an emulator (e.g. Dolphin) to emulate the original, non-HD game. The 3D models of the characters and monsters etc. would scale up to any res, but the backgrounds probably wouldn't look as good as in the HD remaster.

Good sales for an HD remaster aren't good sales for a full remake, which would basically be a new game on its own, and the sales would need to be up to par with that.  A vocal minority, mainly the older fanbase, wants a RE 2 remake, but that doesn't stop horror from being a niche and the action games selling much better. From the viewpoint of a company (which Capcom in the end of the day obviously is), better sales equals higher demand."
residentevil,39r5rr,Zaeh,-2,Sat Jun 13 23:35:43 2015 UTC,"They specifically said HD remasters, not remakes.   Thing is, they were already pushing HD ""remasters"" of RE games well before the success of REmake (Re4/Code Veronica) so there's gotta be something different about their strategy which goes beyond simply doing more of what they were kinda already doing.   Hopefully that difference is a return to REmakes. After all, RE0 is an easy increment since there's almost no need to rework the graphics, but after that the most obvious step is to remake the other original RE games."
residentevil,39r5rr,tiger66261,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:39:09 2015 UTC,"They were doing it before, and now that they release there's a lot of good money in it, they're going to focus on it even more.  Again, they're specifically focusing on remasters, not remakes."
residentevil,39r5rr,Zaeh,0,Mon Jun 15 07:26:53 2015 UTC,No... they weren't. There was nothing to remaster at that point in time. You don't understand the difference between a remaster and a remake. The former is a cosmetic brush-up. The latter is a whole new game.
residentevil,39r5rr,News_Bot,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"You're misunderstanding my comment. when I said ""rework the graphics"" I meant that as effectively making a whole new game.  I already know remasters are cosmetic brush-ups, I just made the point that they technically did it for previous games. Code Veronica got 1080p and a reworked lighting system, and RE4 got a HD release. What I said hardly makes me ""not understand the difference between remasters/remakes"".  RE0 remastered is the next obvious step since it has graphics that can hold up this generation, but the other originals don't, so it makes sense for Capcom to completely rework those games."

I'm speculating that Capcom will eventually move onto Remakes to maintain the same quality of graphics that REmake 1 and RE0 had.   I said this in response to someone who (rightly so) made the point that Capcom is very likely focused on remasters alone. I said it for the purpose of injecting some hope into the idea that Remake 2 isn't dead. So there, I've stated the content and purpose of my original comment.   You're not really saying anything.   Yeah, says the person who is spouting blatantly obvious stuff."

If done correctly you can get through the second half without the handguns. When you find the scope for the handguns put it on billy's and have him use it.  His height makes it easier to pull off head shots.   Acid rounds are great for facing the tyrant. Keep the hookshot in places where you can easily get to it like the lobby. Play as billy with a heavy weapons load out during the final fight. Molotov's are great on the leech men but remember to run away from them before they explode. Easy mode gives you enough ammo to kill everything in the game if you use your ammo wisely.  Normal mode, not so much.  Hard mode, shooting every enemy will get you killed."

Neither version has ""shitty voice acting"". Japanese acting in a Japanese game is almost never inferior. Most Capcom games are localized pretty well. ""lip syncing"" is a pretty specific thing to ask for considering the first 3 games didn't even have characters move their mouths.  I understand your desire for a hard copy, but the money saved by going digital only was probably one of the reasons the game ever came out in the first place."

Unfortunately the GameCube version of RE0 didn't haven't this scheme.   Anyway... anybody else ever try it? Right trigger is like the gas pedal to make your character run and you steer with the left stick. It adds a lot of mobility and lets you walk by just a light trigger pull."

I would just like to be able to bind Action and Fire to the same button because there is zero reason for them to be apart. There's probably a pad scheme that acts like the old controls, but the game wouldn't let me do it on keyboard. The run button should also cancel out of menus and stuff.

It's not because of the gameplay; I'm fine with Capcom doing a shooter variation of Resident Evil (so long as it is kept as a spinoff like Chronicles, Survivor and Outbreak had their own gameplay). It's more to do with how meh the story is, and how cliche the atmospheres are. RE7, I really hope they do something right with it. Otherwise, they might as well pull the plug on this."

residentevil,39a9kf,Zaeh,4,Wed Jun 10 14:28:48 2015 UTC,"That could be it as well, but if I remember correctly, the very reason that Chris was called into Africa was because there were hints that Wesker was still alive (and it was only Jill who was presumed dead).  One might argue that he was trying to get bulkier for the 2006 confrontation as well, due to seeming more bulkier in Revelations and Lost in Nightmares than in CV.

That information was given to Chris, who took matters into his own hands and investigated where Irving conducted his B.O.W. transactions. By investigating bioterrorists in the U.S., he discovered that 3/5 of them took place in Kijuju. However, he also discovered evidence of Jill's survival, but kept it to himself. Suddenly, Chris was filled with a ""burning desire"" to participate in Irving's arrest, as a means to find out more about Jill and ostensibly to uncover Irving's connection to the bioterrorism incident in America.  As for his bulking up, he started in 2003 once his focus turned to apprehending Wesker, now that Umbrella was gone."

People laughed at first when we saw the new chris, but theres a very good reason why he's so jacked.   When chris and wesker last met, wesker proved to be a very strong opponent for chris. He literally had ""super human"" strength. Chris was no match for his former leader of STARS.  Wesker's super human strength set a bench mark for chris. If he was going to fight BOWs, he had to be strong enough to take on the toughest one, wesker. This makes re5's confrontation between the two so great and powerful. Finally when they do fight, chris actually proves to be somewhat of a challenge for wesker thanks to his dedication of stopping the ""toughest BOWs."" This is shown when chris tackles wesker in a cinemas and during gameplay when you dodge wesker's attacks and punch him back. Chris punches wesker with everything he had, and has to shake his fist out to reduce the pain. Its just another example of Chris's dedication to stopping BOWs but more directly, wesker.  TLDR: chris bulked up because of wesker"

Lemme paint a picture:  Imagine Wesker wiping the sweat off his brow after a training session with like 6 Wing Chun dummies. They all lay shattered on the ground, and he walks over to and sits on the bench in his home gym, opens a locket and says ""You know I can give you what you can never have with your current arrangement.

And if I remember correctly Ada is referred to as Ada most of the time but Leon calls her something else once or twice. On top of that they meet the Merchant. Not again but for like the first time, but yet they still know him but they don't and when he dies Leon shows the strangest mix of sorrow and complete apathy. There was supposed to be an erotic angle to it too but the writer seemed to have severe ADD, like they'd write something along the lines of ""Leon leaned against the wall to catch his breath after a break in the action and his eyes wandered over the gorgeous athletic visage of Ada. He couldn't help but want to get away from the monster and dreaded the pile of paperwork waiting for him.""

residentevil,39852c,CyberneticCuntSmashr,7,Wed Jun 10 15:00:41 2015 UTC,"Because they don't have Paul W.S Anderson anywhere near them.  But to be honest the CGI films aren't written that well. They stick to action and the same character cliches the more recent main games do, which doesn't work well for a movie to be honest.  In a film screenplay you have the chance to create real characters put up against insane odds. Well, we get the insane odds, but the characters are about as flat and empty as the shit Anderson writes.  We never really get to know much about who they are on the inside really, we just see them ""doing their jobs"" as protagonists without getting to know them as people. Those important character driven moments(small and large) don't really seem to be there, but the action always is.  Which is a real shame because that shows how little the writers know the characters, or shows how little there is to the characters outside of them being government agents."
residentevil,39852c,wrathborne,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:35:25 2015 UTC,"I can't say bad things about the cgi movies because I saw them when paul worst sh** anderson was fudging this license, so it seemed way better than it may be. But I can agree with you about the emptyness of Andersons writting. It's just pieces of wood as actors and none connection with the games"
residentevil,39852c,wrathborne,2,Wed Jun 10 00:56:50 2015 UTC,"Despite the CGI films being a huge improvement over the terrible live action films, my biggest problem with Degeneration was the lack of character and character development for Leon and Claire.  yeah, the match their video game counter parts just fine but as far as them being people? Doesn't happen. I don't know if its Japanese screenwriting(which has its own formulas and tropes) or Capcoms management but Claire and Leon just have so little to them its really sad.  One of the big things about screenwriting here in the west is that you have the first 10 pages of your screenplay to establish as much of your characters and the world they live in as possible.  Its a necessity to show a characters strengths, weaknesses, status in society(rich,poor), occupation, and how they are emotionally(Are they excitable? able to stay calm? withdrawn?).   There are so many ways to do this from clothing, to someone not laughing at a joke, how they talk, hobbies etc.  Both Claire and Leon have so little to who they are outside working for Terrasave and the government. Both are able to stay calm in just about any situation, both are in good payings jobs, both can fight, both of them share occupations dedicated to protecting others.  Essentially, they're the close to being the same character if you remove Claire protecting children, and Leon making women swoon when hes not fighting monsters.  So what about their flaws? Do they have some kind of empty emotional void that they're trying to fill? Because these are BIG parts of characters in movies. Every character has a weakness and is empty emotionally somewhere at the begging of the story that they manage to fill by the end of the story.  This also goes for the villain of the story who is usually the polar opposite of the protagonists.  They can do everything the protagonist can, but better. But the protagonists major strength is usually the antagonists major weakness.  There is such an art form to the craft of screenwriting and I saw so little of it used for Degeneration. I didn't bother with Damnation because I knew the screenwriting wouldn't be much better than the previous film.  I don't know if Capcom wanted to take the approach of ""its just a video game movie, don't try too hard"", but thats what I saw when I watched Degeneration."
residentevil,39852c,LexCrunch,5,Wed Jun 10 02:37:06 2015 UTC,"I actually really didn't like Degeneration, but I've heard Damnation is pretty good.  What went wrong with the live action series is that they turned an otherwise harmless spin-off fanfiction into an all out mess when trying to incorporate canon characters. I loved the first movie."
residentevil,39852c,Ryndis,6,Tue Jun 9 23:25:29 2015 UTC,Degeneration would've been a lot better if there was more action and less Claire playing Scoobie Doo.
residentevil,39852c,LexCrunch,3,Wed Jun 10 00:44:40 2015 UTC,"But degeneration and damnation take a route that I would like to see in the games. There must be something related to Umbrella or Wilpharma and Degeneration had a good plot on that. The other movies, since the 3rd movie, it just become awfull to see...  But it probably is like culebrero says. Only the japanese can do something good"
residentevil,39852c,Elda-Taluta,2,Tue Jun 9 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"Only the japanese can do something good   I don't know, Powerpuff Girls Z was pretty awful."

residentevil,39852c,JaySilver,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:01:23 2015 UTC,"I think they both kind of miss the mark one what makes me enjoy RE. I enjoy seeing familiar monsters and characters as much as anyone, but I just don't think any RE movie has managed to capture the tone of the games. They all rely way too much on action than atmosphere. But I do agree the CG movies are more on the mark than the live action ones."
residentevil,39852c,EvilResident662,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"Unfornutaly, even the games can't manage to capture the RE atmosphere anymore. The 6th one just killed the franchise...  But the CGI movies at least got the characters right. What they've done to Wesker in the 5th movie (or 6th? I don't know, they,ve done way too much movies) was just wrong"
residentevil,39852c,LORDCOSMOS,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:38:27 2015 UTC,yeah the animated ones are awesome the only one of the live action re movies i liked is re-2 mostly in a so bad it's good kind of way

residentevil,39852c,culebrero,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:42:52 2015 UTC,"The movies are their own thing, it's just an artist making movies with his friends, I think they are just having a fun time making them and putting all they can into each film trying to make them more crazy than the last. The first two kinda took themselves seriously but the rest are just action movies with a virus.   I don't connect them with the games. It's like the batman movies, they aren't connected, just someone else's version of the universe.   The animated movies I do compare to the games though because they use the same characters in the same timeline who look just like the game models"
residentevil,397ph5,yeahbro29,3,Tue Jun 9 21:20:22 2015 UTC,I use the shotgun as soon as I get it. You can easily kill bosses with the handgun and not take damage at all.

residentevil,397ph5,sungazer69,2,Tue Jun 9 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"As soon as you get it. But don't shoot everything, focus on dodging as many regular zombies as you can, because you'll have pretty huge problems if they become crimsom heads. You don't really need the gun anymore after you get the shotgun."
residentevil,397ph5,Anfrers,2,Tue Jun 9 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"Well, all you gotta do is just burn em good and they won't come back as crimsons lol. Also I guess Jill's fire ammo for the grenade launcher burns them, so no canteen required lol"
residentevil,397ph5,OpieKid,2,Wed Jun 10 01:19:57 2015 UTC,"Holly s***! 45 shells? You have enough to kill everyone around with one shot.   Normally I keep de shotgun to harder monsters, but with so many shells you can use it safely vs zombies. But try to hold it for the crimson heads"

residentevil,394uak,ScarOf94,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:11:41 2015 UTC,Here's an official statement on RE.net. Update confirmed to fix connection issues for PS3 and PS4.
residentevil,394uak,DrHoenybun,-3,Tue Jun 9 23:08:37 2015 UTC,The PS3 got this update months ago....
residentevil,391dio,Warruzz,7,Mon Jun 8 15:20:37 2015 UTC,I really liked Zero. I can dig this.
residentevil,391dio,TheAcademyAward,4,Mon Jun 8 15:23:10 2015 UTC,Looks great. Zero is in my top three Resident Evil games.
residentevil,391dio,windwaker910,-7,Mon Jun 8 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, no offense, I enjoyed 0 as well, but I need to know your top 3 now."
residentevil,391dio,raysweater,5,Mon Jun 8 20:24:15 2015 UTC,The other two are Remake and 3.
residentevil,391dio,windwaker910,-7,Mon Jun 8 20:30:46 2015 UTC,"You confuse me, but it's your list. So I'm not going to argue it."
residentevil,391dio,raysweater,4,Mon Jun 8 20:38:48 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to this. It'll also prompt me to buy the REmake Remaster too. I played RE0 and REmake on the GC a few months ago and thought they still held up pretty decently graphically.  I find the grumbling about 2 or 3 not getting the remake silly as these are remasters, not remakes."
residentevil,391dio,IHeartCake69,8,Mon Jun 8 22:31:46 2015 UTC,Coop?
residentevil,391dio,DrPengGwin,4,Mon Jun 8 15:51:24 2015 UTC,Coop would be GLORIOUS for this.
residentevil,391dio,Billy_Pilgrim86,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"I thought so too. I mean, they have 6+ months to do this. Networking is more than doable"
residentevil,391dio,iash91,2,Tue Jun 9 08:43:39 2015 UTC,"It's doable of course, but they will most likely decide not to.  The whole thing with Remake HD was that they were very clear about not messing with the original game, and only changing things as little as possible (aside from graphics).  I'd assume the same goes for Zero HD."
residentevil,391dio,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:34:11 2015 UTC,"Well seeing as Re1 wasn't ever coopable in any capacity, I can understand the sentiment. However, 0 seemed perfect for it. Who knows, it could have been the intended vision (certainly seemed that way) but was quite limited. To be honest, I doubt they'll do it because capcom a mentally is always least amount of work for maximum profit. It would be nice though, considering it wouldn't be taking away from the game, only adding to it"
residentevil,391dio,iash91,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:40:54 2015 UTC,It could also completely ruin the game. I don't think Capcom want's to be taking any risks with these.
residentevil,391dio,Zaeh,0,Tue Jun 9 09:50:23 2015 UTC,"Billy will always follow you to accompany in various puzzles involving chess, messing around with air conditioning and if you pre-order, special twister game just for two! Also Billy is capable of saving you from dying state by patting your back to cheer you up!     I see that one comin'"
residentevil,391dio,Turtlez4lyfe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:47:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the makers never want to mess with the original game."
residentevil,391dio,TrendWarrior101,3,Tue Jun 9 18:34:16 2015 UTC,I never got to play RE0 because I never owned a GameCube. I'm so freaking excited to play this on the PS4!
residentevil,391dio,mazdo,6,Tue Jun 9 03:12:43 2015 UTC,When the fuck are they going to do 2! It's the best game in the whole fucking series!
residentevil,391dio,Azoththemerciless,4,Tue Jun 9 02:23:16 2015 UTC,"A 2 remake would be a big, big thing. I think they would give it the same level of attention as a brand new numbered game, and until they're ready to do that, it won't happen."
residentevil,391dio,Arial10pt,-2,Tue Jun 9 17:53:45 2015 UTC,"Yes it would. I would think it would be a relatively easy game to make (it has a huge built in fan base, it's already a proven success)  I am really surprised Capcom isn't jumping on making it."
residentevil,391dio,Azoththemerciless,3,Tue Jun 9 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go as far as to say that it would be easy to make, but I think it would be a certain success provided that they gave it enough attention. I wonder if they would use the third-person style introduced in 4, or stick with the classic gameplay?"
residentevil,391dio,Arial10pt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"I've been playing through all the main titles over and over again this year, but this is the only one I've held off on for this very reason."
residentevil,391dio,kiuaswarrior,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:16:47 2015 UTC,Those background textures look alot cleaner than REmake. So excited.
residentevil,391dio,bigbrwnbear,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:52:35 2015 UTC,"I think they've gone in and changed some stuff, like improved the textures and whatnot. The zombies seem a lot bloodier and the backgrounds seem WAY more detailed than they were on Gamecube. There also seems to be some color correction changes and new lighting."
residentevil,391dio,Sissle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:04:58 2015 UTC,Looks like they actually put more effort in it than in REmaster? Maybe Capcom figured out the right direction finally
residentevil,391dio,Turtlez4lyfe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:00:53 2015 UTC,"REmaster sold WAY better than they were expecting it to, and was apparently Capcom's fastest selling digital product to DATE. Im not surprised to see them putting more effort into Zero HD. I just hope it sells well too, but you can bet your F.Aid sprays that the next item on the list is REmake 2."
residentevil,391dio,Sissle,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:06:15 2015 UTC,"Really hope you're right, since a RE 2 remake would take more than just overhauling some graphics."
residentevil,391dio,RamBo-ZamBo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:57:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, that's why I said REmake 2. Do what they did with REmake. Just make a new version from scratch. Add new areas, beef up the puzzles. Add back in some of the gameplay stuff that was cut in 1.5 (like the shooting galleries or the dynamically mutating zombies). Add VACT and burning bodies in. Make it the most hardcore RE2 experience possible, and a true visual followup to REmake and Zero."
residentevil,391dio,Sissle,2,Tue Jun 9 04:08:46 2015 UTC,The dream. Fans been wanting this for over ten years though. Hope the success of remastered and probably of zero make capcom reconsider this.
residentevil,391dio,RamBo-ZamBo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:48:26 2015 UTC,"I think its absolutely on the table. After RE6's critical failure, Capcom put out a survey asking fans what they wanted. HD versions of REmake and Zero were on there, as well as remakes of RE2 and 3."

residentevil,391dio,Kenshin23,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:12:47 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping they would make some changes to the game. Kinda like what i said here:   ""Hopefully if they think about remastering zero, they'll change it a bit. Always found it a bit lackluster. The enemies are indeed a problem, hopefully they can replace them with stuff less stupid; animals are ok if you are in a zoo (like outbreak). Give us lickers or other infected humanoids.  Zero should be their next remaster as its eadier to do than RE2Rem (they would have to do it from scratch). Im afraid they will be lazy and just repack it with enhanced graphics and no others changes on gameplay/story.""

A lot of people on here were guessing that 0 would get the first remaster. but I wasn't sure. Turns out they were right haha.  Now im guessing that the next remaster will be RE4. That would be so awesome to see that amazing game completely redone and in beautiful HD"

residentevil,38ym1q,JoeKrauzer,2,Tue Jun 9 08:12:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, it turns out that I am god awful at RE3 Mercenaries.  I don't feel too bad though since I've never played it before this morning.  I do take issue with the use of the ""TOTAL"" line being used for scoring though.  It seems to me that it is a number that accumulates each time you finish and isn't directly a result of how good of a run you have.  As you will see in my picture, I have an awful score, but a relatively high (I'm assuming) ""TOTAL"" line.  I can take no credit for that line since I had to download a save file just to have access to the Mercenaries part of the game.  We should probably judge based on the ""Reward"" line as that is what you gained during the run.  Anyway, here is my submission: http://imgur.com/erLUnEn EU version, Gamecube, emulated  As you can see, I did awful.  If literally anyone else attempts this, I'm sure they will beat it.

residentevil,38ym1q,ripperc100jr,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:35:00 2015 UTC,"Nicholai is actually the best simply because he has a knife, which almost completely eliminates the time crisis that everyone else faces since each kill with it gives him a lot of time. It also lets him kill way more monsters than everyone else since it won't run out of ammo, so if you're trying for a money score then he's the best pick.  Nicholai's lack of strong weapons makes him difficult, but the knife alone makes him the best. It also helps him more easily abuse RE3's stupid dodge move."
residentevil,38ym1q,JoeKrauzer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"Totally forgot about the knife time bonuses.

Leon because hes just a badass and his one liners are a nice bit of comedy to uplift you in shitty situations. And who could forget that epic mobster hat toss?"

The cop car, the bus, the plane, and the BSAA Heli. All destroyed while he was piloting.  The only vehicles that has ever survived close proximity to Leon was the Jet-Ski and Ada's helicopter. The cop car in RE2, the Semi in RE2, the Umbrella train in RE2, the Police's car in RE4, the truck just before the castle portion in RE4 and even Mike's helicopter! ALL destroyed! Just keep him the FUCK away from anything that runs on fossil fuel.   gets pussy whipped by every female character   I don't agree with that bit. He turned Ashley down in RE4, and never had a thing for Claire or Helana. Only Ada.  Edit : The Jeep Leon drove into Racoon City got destroyed too. It HAS to be a running joke by now.

A group of well-defined characters all working together in this huge mansion, getting killed off one by one, trying to uncover it's secrets. I loved the dynamic with Jill & Barry, Chris & Rebbecca. How there was lots of optional cutscenes and gameplay segments between everyone, how your best bud could die at specific moments if you did the wrong thing. Backtracking through various areas, realizing something's changed since the last time you've been there.   That game did everything right. Even stuff that was terrible just made the experience better. I really hope Capcom returns to that level of greatness with REmake 2 or even RE7. It turned me into an RE fanatic."
residentevil,38tp59,captured-stars,3,Sat Jun 6 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"A REmake of 2 (or maybe 3), if crafted the same as REmake 1, could seriously be the peak of the series.  Like, for the rest of time."
residentevil,38tp59,LexCrunch,3,Sat Jun 6 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"The way, in the early games at least, you'd show up and have to piece together what had gone on through reading diaries and reports left lying around. For me, that's a lot more powerful than actually seeing it all unfold.  Exploring a seemingly empty mansion that has obviously been inhabited recently was a level of creepiness at which I was unaccustomed."

residentevil,38tp59,LexCrunch,4,Sat Jun 6 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"I'm here mainly for the nostalgic value of the original games, i.e. RE1/2/3.  I remember my first game I've ever played was RE2 on a PlayStation my older brother bought. After we finished the game multiple times, we got our hands on RE1 and we played the shit out of that.  This was before the RE3 was released. We were subscribed to a gaming magazine and one day we received an issue with RE3 on the cover. We were out of our minds!  We used to chill out on the playground with our friends and read about the upcoming new version, during the summer when the evenings were so warm, everything was lit from a big moon and cicadas were singing their songs.  Every time a post pops up on on this sub, all these memories come back to me for a second as if it was yesterday, reminding me how simple and beautiful life was when we were kids."
residentevil,38tp59,FamilyGlue,2,Sun Jun 7 18:27:56 2015 UTC,"It's just the series I love and nerd on the most. I don't know a whole lot of people who are all that into it, so I keep my trap shut so as not to annoy them. Unfortunately, most of my opinions on the series are very contrary to the majority of this board and most RE fans in general. Still, 2 and 5 and 6 are some of my favorite games of all time and I like to talk about what I really like and read others' views even if they have a tendency to give me ulcers.  The old games had this really cool presentation about them that felt like playing through a B-grade horror movie, and it was fun and surprisingly deep. Even when it shifted its direction to be an action shooter, it pulled it off with a unique finesse that I absolutely adore. RE is its own brand all across the board, and it's managed to avoid being at all generic all throughout. Capcom is generally pretty good at that."
residentevil,38tp59,hellaradbabe,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:06:03 2015 UTC,"If you loved 2 and 6, have you played 4?  IMO it combines the best aspects of those games you listed.  It's like a slower, more horror themed RE6 Leon campaign."

residentevil,38tp59,Anfrers,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:54:12 2015 UTC,"Fighting zombies was just super boring compared to j'avo. I can't figure out why it's the most liked campaign.  Credit where it's due, as lame and ridiculously anime as it was, 4 did tension extremely well sometimes. Any section where you're being chased, like through the hanging shipment containers or through the sewers by Verdugo or by Novastardos, was very tense thanks to the brilliant camera and sound design. Having beaten it several times, it still works on me.  But then you just buy a rocket launcher before any boss to kill it in one hit and the trance is broken."

That said, my A8-3500 with integrated 6620G struggles with the original Resident Evil Remake. I turned every setting down and forced a 640x480 resolution in the config just to see if it made a difference and it gets 19-22 fps. So I would say you have a chance at running Resident Evil 4 at 30 frames, considering your laptop is a bit faster.

I think he’s done with this, but as I’m about to ask another question, he interrupts. “If I had to name the woman character I most disliked in my games it would be Rebecca Chambers,” he says. “She’s submissive, she’s not independent. I didn’t want to include her but the staff wanted that kind of character in the game, for whatever reason. I’m sure it made sense to them. And in Japan, that character is pretty popular.” He shrugs despondently."
residentevil,38jtq8,News_Bot,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:51:04 2015 UTC,Mikami had no say over what characters appeared in any game after BIO1.
residentevil,38jtq8,theCleversleazoid,3,Sat Jun 6 01:33:48 2015 UTC,"Bring Rebecca back! I was stoked to see Barry make a return to the limelight in Rev 2, love ol' Bazza and his Magnum haha. But I'd be just as excited to see Rebecca come back to the front stage and head up her own game again, perhaps even have her reunited with Billy somehow. It could fill in their backstory of what they've been up to the last 17 years that has passed in the Resi-verse, and perhaps have them also meet one or two of the other STARS members?  Who knows, the possibilities are endless really, they've literally got a blank slate to work with over that time period. What if they were sent in to clean up after Leon and finish off the last of the Ganados that could be still roaming around [even without Saddler, I don't imagine the las Plagas just withered and died inside the hosts] Or could they have tried to take out the facility that produced the Tyrant that hunted Leon/Claire in RE2's second scenario. I'm just spitballing here, but yeah the possibilities :D"
residentevil,38jtq8,Billy_Pilgrim86,3,Thu Jun 4 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"There's a fan theory that she's tracked down and killed by Nemesis, but fact remains that she wasn't used in 2-4 because she was Shinji Mikami's least favorite STARS member ( http://www.relyonhorror.com/latest-news/shinji-mikami-likes-rebecca-chambers-the-least/ ). There have been a number of main characters that have vanished in the RE universe, which makes sense...you can't expect everyone that survives that sort of ordeal to sign up for it again and again (for example, Carlos Oliveira, Ark Thompson, Bruce McGivern, etc. etc.). Admittedly they weren't STARS per se, but given the consideration that the STARS team was essentially a glorified SWAT team, that doesn't mean too too much.   I think depending on how strongly the RE:0 remaster sells, fans might see her again soon."
residentevil,38jtq8,bristow84,2,Fri Jun 5 13:55:58 2015 UTC,Well she does appear in a novel by SD Perry. However I don't believe the novels are canon
residentevil,38jtq8,Zaeh,3,Fri Jun 5 00:20:22 2015 UTC,They are not canon at all.
residentevil,38jtq8,NXMT,3,Fri Jun 5 00:50:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's all that unusual if Rebecca decided to drop off the radar. She was just a medic after all. She probably stayed behind in a more support role rather than get thrown into the middle of a conflict. With Wesker and Umbrella gone, the surviving STARS members weren't being hounded anymore. The whole premise of RE3 was that the survivors were targets. The others that continued getting into fights was because they put themselves into those kinds of positions."
residentevil,38jtq8,News_Bot,2,Fri Jun 5 03:52:16 2015 UTC,"She isn't just a medic but also a police officer. She was granted the same ability as any police officer should.

Rebecca would've gotten a BIO3 epilogue by Yasuhisa Kawamura, but since it was believed that Noboru Sugimura would cover her story in BIO0, Kawamura never wrote anything. He could afford to do so with Claire, Chris etc because CODE:Veronica's scenario was already complete, but BIO0's was not."

With the introduction of ""life crystals"" I find this game to be way too easy.  And don't get me started on the Omega level. It was basically the same recycled end-game boss with literally no real tweaks. Granted Rev 1 wasn't any better, but they did add the really bad ass version of said boss if you did the level right. I felt 2 lacked that intensity that 1 had.  I'd totally be up for an increased multiplayer cap. It's one of the few reasons I appreciate ORC is because it had four-player coop. Adding in with the fact that you could ""make your own character"" would be pretty damn great. Now if they were to increase it to three or four player maxes I think the enemy counts and difficulty would have to go up proportionally. But if this game were to turn out to be anything like Mass Effect 3's multiplayer I'd support it instantly.  As for the skills well honestly... I wasn't too fond of how many you could load up on a character. Rev 1 had a pretty good balance to it. Pre-set skills for different characters without going overboard. I appreciate the fact that you can pick which ones you want, but I felt that having so many slots and having so little useful skills to pick from was a bit unsatisfactory.  So far I like this idea. Have you thought about taking this idea to Capcom? I don't know the steps behind that but I feel we could use another game similar to Mercenaries 3D especially if it was on a larger scale."

I hate the randomized enemy perks in Revs 2.  Less grinding than Revs 2 as well, I burned out on that earlier than I would have liked.  Original maps with some unique objective-based progression. Mix things up a bit vs 'go find the thing and smash it'.  A properly-implemented version of RE5 tank controls. It should be a viable playstyle with its own balanced pros and cons, not a tacked-on afterthought like it has been in recent titles.

Stages should have A LOT more enemies and more enemies and multiple bosses that actually pose a threat should be thrown at you at once. Way harder boss rush stages should exist. The enemies should be a lot stronger because the controls, the sparsity of enemies and the skills in Revelations 2 makes the difficulty a joke. Like PK said, a randomizer would be interesting.  A mixture of arena stages and the stages from Revelations 1. Every playable character (Mercenaries/raid or main campaign) from 5, Revelations, 6 and Revelations 2 should be featured. Every costume from those games should be available. New characters and costumes should be introduced.  The ability to spend money to level characters. Should be balanced so that it's easier to level when you're far into raid more so leveling all the characters doesn't become tedious.  More maps. A LOT more maps. Go crazy if you can just port them over like they did with the maps from 6. Melees. A lot of them. Give everyone their melee back and create new ones for the characters that have few. None of that recycling and sharing of melee BS. Introduction of more skills and balance tweaks for existing ones.  Addition of more enemies and bosses from the various games.  Every weapon.

Though, I haven't started Rev2 yet, so if that's been added since 1 - great!"
residentevil,3892r3,PK_Thundah,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:30:33 2015 UTC,"The base enemy types aren't random (ex. Zombie, Revenant, Skagdead) but they get a set of random difficulty-based modifiers that vary things up. More outlandish stuff than Revs 1- explode on death, poison cloud, makes you drop weapons, stuff like that.  Sadly, higher difficulties combined with the randomness can make for some punishingly cheap encounter setups."
residentevil,3892r3,ShiftyAxel,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:58:49 2015 UTC,"PERSONALLY, I think Raid mode works better as a bonus to a main game. Just like Mercenaries, actually. Mercenaries 3D was fun, but still felt lacking compared to a full game.   That said, Raid mode is such a simple concept (I mean that as a compliment) that there is really no limit to how many types of games it could be applied to:  1) It could be RE: Outbreak, only with RPG elements and a skill system!  2) It could be like Left 4 Dead, but with loot!  3) It could be like Borderlands, but horror themed!   Any of these games could be great if handled correctly, but, as I said, I like it better as an extra."
residentevil,3892r3,MarkaliteMkII,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:29:52 2015 UTC,"I think a full fledged title could work. The problem with Mercenaries 3D was that it was very mediocre with such a small amount of content. Imagine how much fun a full fledged Mercenaries title with all of the previous characters and costumes, tons of enemy variety, ton of stages, proper balancing and new content could be on a console. It wouldn't be for everyone, but for me the replay value would be insane. It'd be one of my favorite games ever."

Challenge your friends to beat them with set weapons + addons which they can use + install for that raid only. At the end of a set time, which ever of your friends held the high score would get a randomized prize based on the difficulty of the raid you created."

residentevil,386lot,TrendWarrior101,5,Tue Jun 2 05:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think in just seeing the 1.5 station as a ""what if"" is extremely interesting. It feels more like it could be an actual P.D. but in the end I definitely prefer the finished product. I just found it to be more creepy a place as the mansion from the original. Like you know it's supposed to be a police station, but everything is placed to what I imagine is unconventional. Learning it used to be an art museum IIRC was cool, plus Irons having that weird decor all over made it feel uncanny.  Now we can only wonder if 1.5 actually had bathrooms..."
residentevil,386lot,ShadowLeggy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:21:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you play 1.5, it does have bathrooms, unlike Resident Evil 2. I take it, you haven't played the fan-made Resident 1.5 right?"

residentevil,386lot,Ryndis,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but 1.5 police station seems to be convincing, considering a once modern-looking building that were seemingly invincible were taken over by the zombies and now the nightmare pretty starts to set in. Resident Evil 2 setting is kinda cool too, it's very atmospheric-like, but I think 1.5 setting with a modern-like setting is a little  bit unsettling. Don't you think?"
residentevil,386lot,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:38:28 2015 UTC,"RE2 followed more in the footsteps of 1 than 1.5 looked to. The idea is the player seeks refuge in what looks like a normal location on the outside, but on the inside is not what you'd expect. It's not necessarily that 2 was more atmospheric than 1.5, but as NB put it was just a better atmosphere for the game.  1 and 2 had a very spooky feel to them where 1.5 looked a lot more like 3. It looks like it was going to be a bit more action oriented than 1 and 2 were.  I think the big idea is basically this. In 1 and 2, when turning a corner the player asks themselves ""What is behind that corner?"". In 1.5/3 the player would ask themselves, ""How many?"".  That being said, kudo's goes to Capcom's level designers. I loved that you can pretty much tell exactly what would have happened in Elza's intro cinematic by the room she starts in. Environmental Story telling at its finest."

residentevil,38032i,ShadowLeggy,12,Sun May 31 21:35:41 2015 UTC,I think it's because they were designed with multiplayer cooperation in mind. I've always felt the Outbreak games were massively ahead of their time.  It's a concept that's well worth revisiting.
residentevil,38032i,traceitalian,5,Sun May 31 21:55:09 2015 UTC,I think they suffered the same problem as REmake did of being released on the wrong console. I don't think PS2 had the online community that X-Box had at the time to really support it.
residentevil,38032i,Ryndis,5,Sun May 31 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. If capcom want something dynamite, incorporating the mechanics and the online aspects of 'Outbreak' and combine that with a kick ass intractable trailor for all platforms is a good idea surely? Better idea than 6"

residentevil,38032i,ShadowLeggy,2,Sun May 31 23:05:28 2015 UTC,I think i recall it going up to 4 player. I sadly also missed the online gameplay. There's actually servers up for the japanese version held up by fans i believe.

residentevil,38032i,ShadowLeggy,2,Mon Jun 1 12:21:06 2015 UTC,They are indeed really fucking hard. Only real way to describe them.  Did you get good at any of the levels though? I found the R.P.D. level (Desperate Times) and the subway level to be great. I just had to memorize them to be able to beat them on Hard. Though the subway gave me more trouble due to the boss fight. I find Outbreak File #2 to be a vast upgrade of the first one gameplay wise.
residentevil,38032i,ShadowLeggy,1 point,Sun May 31 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"The only scenarios I ever beat legitimately on the hardest difficulties was Outbreak and Flashback. The latter only because of that super-fast ending involving the mother and daughter, and I'm pretty sure everyone else died along the way.  I had a bit more trouble with File #2 due to the changed control scheme, but otherwise I enjoyed it too. All those stalking boss enemies tho..."
residentevil,38032i,pwnedkiller,1 point,Sun May 31 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"That axeman sure knows how to ruin your day in Flashback. As if the poisonous zombies weren't enough, or the dang wasps on the roof.  I'd recommend giving Desperate times another look over. Desperate times is purely about memorization and anti tear gas cans. All you really have to do is take down a number of enemies to win at the end. To stock up, near the end keep Marvin waiting and i think there will be a key to open the roof padlock to get a weapon/supplies. The garage gate should now be open so you can run in there and loot some weapons in that tunnel. There should be a key on a dead guy on the dog kennels now that will unlock the safe on the second floor east wing. I feel sorry for him, all he wanted to do was check on the dogs. Plus i could've used the extra damn help.  Pretty much just either equip the AI with some extra firepower, or use them as bait as you take care of the zombies and you're good to go."
residentevil,38032i,ShadowLeggy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"Also, props on beating Wild Things on Hard Leggy. I believe i beat all the other ones on Hard, but that one level broke my spirit."

residentevil,38032i,RubyLight,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:09:14 2015 UTC,The outbreak games are just simply hard because for the reason of pushing multiplayer cooperation in mind. In the end that didnt seem to work out so well. At least in the US I believe another drawl back was the inability of voice chat. The game did amazingly though over in JP though those guys eat that shit up.
residentevil,38032i,potzdamn,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:55:25 2015 UTC,I remember being really confused when I heard it was optional as an online game. Had no idea PS2 was even capable of it at the time. But yeah I can imagine it wasn't too practical relying on the in-game speech.... HI!!!!!
residentevil,38032i,potzdamn,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:24:41 2015 UTC,I say release a remake of both games packaged together with enhanced online capabilities. The games were launched at the wrong time now would be a great time to have those games on PS4/XB1.
residentevil,38032i,potzdamn,2,Mon Jun 1 15:57:52 2015 UTC,I'll be completely honest with you: I've never beaten the first Outbreak. Got stuck at god-knows where in the Hospital and gave up. I was a kid then and haven't gotten back around to trying it out again.  Played Outbreak: File #2 and found it easier than the first (rather odd I know). But yeah you're not alone. For as much of an RE buff as I am I too suck butts at the Outbreak series.
residentevil,38032i,Buh9410,3,Sun May 31 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"Nah man. Outbreak file #2 really is ""easier"" if you can call something that'll gut you relentlessly easier.  I am with you on the hospital level. The only stupid reason i can't beat it is because of the security codes needed to activate the elevator to stop at certain floors The leechman will bust in without much time when you try to input the codes.  I feel you on the being a RE buff. Outbreak just kicks asses and takes names. But its one of the best looks at Raccoon City there is in my opinion. Love that town."
residentevil,38032i,potzdamn,1 point,Sun May 31 23:58:36 2015 UTC,"Outbreak is amazing, but since 99% of the people who still play it are playing it offline I am convinced that the only way to play it now is to play as the Japanese student (forget her name) with the backpack for the additional 4 item slots. The biggest problem I have when I play Outbreak is that I am running around finding new items and trying to decide which to take, which to drop, which to drop and backtrack for, etc."

After that launch trailer, and knowing the game would come out that same year, omg the hype was real!   Ultimately, while I wanted to love it, I really did, the end product just felt too much like it was trying to be a Hollywood movie with way too much stuff just 'crammed in'. That said I still enjoyed the game for what it was and I did finish it in a single sitting, I just fell short of what we all hoped it was gonna be. 5 was great though! Sincerely Co-op done well!"
residentevil,37yi2m,constar90,2,Sun May 31 20:39:45 2015 UTC,"I think RE6 and RE5 are REALLY fun to play with friends, but they really screwed the storyline and a lot of the stuff that makes the older games, but if you're basing it off how much fun you had with your friends it would be high on the list for me for sure."

residentevil,37yi2m,xTye,5,Sun May 31 14:52:01 2015 UTC,"Resident Evil 2 is by far the best even to this day. The cameras are betters, the horror/scare factor is jumped up and far superior to the original. it took the 'this was just a mansion, imagine if it infected an entire city' concept and ran with it as best the hardware could in those days. William Birkins Tyrant is by far the most famous tyrant image with the shoulder eye. then there is just the journey you go on from street crash to underground facilities and the double scenarios for each character changing up item locations and adding additional enemies and puzzles make it that much more replayable.   Plus the character design, sure everyone knows leon as a secret agent badass now, but back then he was the rookie introduced for new players in the series, so if you didnt play the previous game it didn't matter because leon has no connection to it so he is the perfect opening. claire fits the 'veteran' players more because her story is instigated by the outcome of the mansion incident and locating chris.  Quite frankly it is a travesty to gaming capcom have not remade this game. I believe a fan team has and even threw in the god damn nemesis on top of it."

residentevil,37yi2m,Retn4,1 point,Sun May 31 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"Resident Evil 2, for the location, story, and great characters. After that would have to be CV a little bit longer than normal Resident Evil's but still really great. 3/4/ORC/Remake are at the bottom. With revelations a step above."
residentevil,37yi2m,DrHoenybun,1 point,Sun May 31 17:23:36 2015 UTC,wow. your one of the few people ive seen that puts REmake at the bottom. any particular reason?
residentevil,37yi2m,lildozer74,1 point,Sun May 31 17:43:26 2015 UTC,"It was decent, but I didn't like Remake for a couple of reasons. I liked one for the bad voice acting, camera controls and the love of the genre. I don't like how any of the characters look, AKA I hate Jills Face. I hate how everything is really dark and it's hard to see things. More puzzles aren't bad, but I didn't see the need to add Lisa into the game. All she did was act as a nemesis which I thought was a cheap tactic in three for a main villain."
residentevil,37yi2m,DrHoenybun,1 point,Sun May 31 17:58:40 2015 UTC,re1 simply for the fact that introduced me (an the world) to RE. nostalgia OD. ive been lucky enough to play all of them on release throughout the years.

residentevil,37yi2m,birdspee,1 point,Sun May 31 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"Resident Evil Outbreak for defining everything I loved about the series, but also RE2 for introducing me to it.  RE2 is really just perfectly crafted."

I loved the first one and had cleared everything, when the sequel came out I begged for the day off school and was waiting for the game store to open.  The intro, getting to the police station, the duel-paths through the game, the unlockables? I think it set the standard for games to come for a long time."
residentevil,37yi2m,fourthwallcrisis,1 point,Sun May 31 20:24:53 2015 UTC,Code Veronica! and then 2 very shortly after.
residentevil,37yi2m,hercoldhands,1 point,Sun May 31 21:57:14 2015 UTC,2 and 4 mainly 2
residentevil,37yi2m,sourmilkandcereal,1 point,Sun May 31 22:28:45 2015 UTC,"I love 2, but 4 is by far my favorite.  Gameplay is fun, story is hokey B-Movie fun, still enough RE to be RE, but also incorporated a fun gameplay style.  Multiple ways to handle situations, and depending on your armory, different playstyles (I swear people don't know if you don't have the weapon, ammo won't drop for it. Run with only a mine thrower or a rifle!)  I've beaten it on all platforms save for ps2 at an accumulated 22 times. Have the game down so well I can beat it in 2 hours on new game plus, 3~ on new game.   Wii version is my favorite, the controls just moved so well with it. All the added goodies with adas missions and alternatr costumes were just mega bonuses.   Nostalgia is there, but I 100% agree with all the praise it got when it came out."
residentevil,37yi2m,lskennedy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:53:13 2015 UTC,4 is great but very overrated . My favorite would probably be 5 or Revelations 1(Jill and Parker stuff)

residentevil,37yi2m,alpha_alfalfa,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:47:15 2015 UTC,Re 6 and then 5.
residentevil,37yi2m,LexCrunch,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:52:25 2015 UTC,"I actually really hate 4 for a myriad of reasons.  My favorite is 2, followed closely behind by 6."
residentevil,37yi2m,Guttts,-5,Sun May 31 17:40:17 2015 UTC,"You hate 4 for the same reasons as me. It's not a Resident Evil game. It's an action shooter where you get to fight angry Spanish villagers who throw sticks of dynamite at you, with absolutely no horror feel or atmosphere to it."
residentevil,37yi2m,LexCrunch,1 point,Sun May 31 23:02:34 2015 UTC,"Well no, I love action shooters and 5 and 6 did it way better. I adore 5 and 6.  I hate 4 basically because it's dumb, uninteresting, and hasn't aged well at all. Half of the game is an escort mission with blatant anime influences, it abuses QTEs worse than any other in the series, the shooting itself is slow and clunky, and you're allowed to buy a disposable one-hit-kill weapon at any point in time so you don't actually have to fight most bosses.  I think 5 took everything wrong with 4, fixed it, and greatly improved on everything good they already had."
residentevil,37yi2m,lskennedy,1 point,Sun May 31 23:48:59 2015 UTC,"Not to fanboy, but RE4 was one of the first, if not the first, to use quick time events in a game.  So, that could maybe tie in to not aging well, but the QTE was pretty influential and was mind blowing at the time."
residentevil,37yi2m,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. It's just part of how it hasn't aged well, I think. I just get frustrated when 6 gets ragged on for abusing QTEs, but no fingers are ever pointed at 4 for the same point.  Also, Shenmue did QTEs before RE4, and Dragon's Lair was probably the actual first."
residentevil,37yi2m,lskennedy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:40:00 2015 UTC,"Ah! Shenmue, totally forgot about that"
residentevil,37yi2m,Cobalt_Chrome,0,Mon Jun 1 11:47:38 2015 UTC,ORC. Cause it's the only one I've actually played.  I think 4 would be my favorite though if I played all of them.

Capcom is prioritizing HD remakes right now, and after RE Zero the next one they have that wouldn't have to be built from the ground up is Outbreak. I know everyone says they want RE2 (myself included) but that would involve making an entire new game. New assets, new environments, new mo-cap and VO, where as Outbreak is just up scaling the graphics."
residentevil,37w7nb,ThePrinceMagus,1 point,Sun May 31 15:45:43 2015 UTC,"For RE2 all they really have to do is put the environments from Darkside Chronicles into a map.

One of the worst parts of Left 4 Dead and the newer Resident Evil games are the ""pros"" who get on to play and automatically announce that they're team captain and go about telling each person what to carry, where to go, what to do... I don't need that shit while I'm playing. It breaks the atmosphere."
residentevil,37wuqk,theAangstykid,12,Sun May 31 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"I think nothing is gonna come out from Capcom other than RE0 Remastered. No new IPs no remakes/remasters other than RE0.

Maybe starring Sheva? If they wanted to do multiple campaigns again, then I'm sure we'd see the return of a few other characters as well. Jake, Sherry, Rebecca, Claire, Carlos, Billy, etc.   I'm just hoping the game isnt totally all about Jake. I don't find him that interesting as a character.   It would be nice to see some Revelations characters in RE7, but I prefer they stay in the Rev. Series.

Clean it up to be lore friendly as its a freakin cool concept, make it more survivaly with less ammo (not main game scarce since you're a strike team) make it so that allies don't just randomly come back after death- make them get infected, but die slow so you have to search for a cure, and if they die they stay dead- basically you have to complete the campaign on x amount of lives (the lives being the number of squad mates). Picture the final mission (which I guess would be entirely different)- only 3 left, backs to the wall, guns clicking empty, etc.  I know this doesn't answer your question but ORC was such great potential for a RE game and it got doodooed on"

residentevil,37usry,RedfieldTwo,5,Sat May 30 19:45:42 2015 UTC,But it isn't canon. /u/News_Bot is correct because the actual events in RE2 with Leon S. Kennedy happened differently than what happened at the end of ORC.
residentevil,37usry,REsoleSurvivor1000,3,Sat May 30 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"It's an alternate timeline. Operation Raccoon City is a non-canon game that takes place in a parallel universe, similar to Gaiden. It follows the series story up until post-BIO1 and then branches off into something completely different.  It's true that a second U.S.S. squad was deployed into the city, but that story was portrayed in Outbreak (partially, since Outbreak was never fully released). They all died except for one survivor."
residentevil,37usry,News_Bot,1 point,Sat May 30 21:12:23 2015 UTC,"I am aware that there's enough answers here to kinda work with, but I wanna give my thoughts on the matter:  The single player main campaign is okay at best. Amusing in it's own right but there are times and aspects that will frustrate you (especially with higher difficulty play). The story itself is pretty shallow and lacks any depth whatsoever. Bummed me out because I felt like I could like the characters IF it had some development.  The multiplayer versus gameplay is garbage! The network performance is absolutely horrible and the shotgun is incredibly broken (even with single player). Being able to stunlock people on the ground is utter bullshit. The assault rifles/SMGs all feel like they're made of cheese and shoot paperwads while lacking any real power.   The coop multiplayer is one of the better aspects in my opinion. If you can manage to find three other people to play with it's a great time sink and even better as a drinking game! I know /u/chofortu wanted to do something like this eventually and maybe it will happen. Would be fun times.  Other things I don't like about this title: The DLC stuff. The other campaign being a on-disc locked pre-made DLC felt really cheap to me and I never bought it (figured if the game was gonna be THIS bad why bother?). I don't mind the weapon packs too much but the campaign is severely lacking without the things I mentioned so shortening it only adds more salt to the already-seeping wound."

residentevil,37t5mp,TrendWarrior101,3,Sat May 30 04:36:53 2015 UTC,"The beginning of Resident Evil 3 kind of shows an example of how it could fall apart.  I can't think of a safe way to begin clearing areas without using armored vehicles.  Even if you have a large group of soldiers in a defensive position advancing slowly down a street, their gunfire will attract zombies from neighboring streets, blocks, and buildings - eventually squeezing in on all sides.  Then there are the BOWs.  I think if a Hunter got the jump on them, it could kill about 3 soldiers before being taken down; I bet Lickers could kill soldiers at an easy 1:1 ratio.  Maybe 1 soldier dies for every 50 zombies they kill, but there are around 100,000 potential zombies in town.    To actually answer your question, I don't think a military presence like that would be wholly effective.  I think they could clear out a few blocks long enough to fly in some large concrete barriers and establish a mostly safe FOB (as long as it was nowhere near Main Street), but I don't think they could make any progress toward actually clearing out the city without heavy equipment.  And they actaully did something similar to that in the Resident Evil: Outbreak games.  If you haven't played them, they offer the best insight into what was actually happening on the city streets during the Raccoon City incident."

You said that it would be impossible for the military to enter without heavy equipment. I say the military would have no problem using weapons as if they entered into the streets of WWII cities and fight the defenders of the city. I think they would have contained the outbreak with heavy equipment."

residentevil,37t5mp,News_Bot,3,Wed Jun 3 18:29:04 2015 UTC,I'm in a light unit 101st airborne in specific. We specialize in air assaulting missions where we drop large amounts of grounds troops and equipment very rapidly. We could easily  get hundreds of troops on ground in a matter of minutes with full combat loads and heavy equipment. Our only limiting factor would be how many birds we could get at any given moment.
residentevil,37t5mp,News_Bot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"The U.S. Army, National Guard and the FBI set up the blockade around the city after the outbreak and units entered the city to investigate. They suffered casualties and backed off from the city, which is what allowed Leon and Claire to enter despite the blockade.  On top of that, a Delta Force team was deployed to extradite William Birkin and recover the G-Virus. They were killed by the five remaining Tyrants deployed by Umbrella."
residentevil,37t5mp,News_Bot,1 point,Sat May 30 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, only some of the U.S. Army and National Guard units were sent to the city, either to investigate or to retrieve the sample of the G-virus from William Birkin, not to go out and fight the zombies face to face.

residentevil,37t5mp,News_Bot,1 point,Sat May 30 19:54:18 2015 UTC,You just repeated what I said. I didn't say the whole military was sent in. The National Guard and U.S. Army investigation units sent into the city for civilian evacuation and investigation (respectively) were mostly killed.   Delta Force sent to extradite Birkin and recover treatment data and the G-Virus were killed at the disposal plant and hospital.

That's like between 10 to 100 soldiers, I'm talking about thousands or tens of thousands like the ones who stormed Berlin, Stalingrad, or Baghdad, ready for combat and to engage any hostile force.   The U.S. Army surrounding the city suffered casualties in battle with Zombies and backed off to prevent further incidents.   So did the Zombies went out of the city then battle the U.S. Army guarding the barricade or infiltrated among the civilians? I think it's so bizarre to think considering the U.S. Army have .50 cals, M-16s, tanks, artillery guns, etc."
residentevil,37t5mp,News_Bot,1 point,Sun May 31 05:53:40 2015 UTC,It was never stipulated how many military personnel were in or around the city.  Zombies reached the blockade and fought the U.S. Army. Any infected civilians taken into custody were killed before they could become a Zombie. Just because the army has access to that arsenal doesn't mean the blockade had them. It was not a big military operation.
residentevil,37t5mp,fourthwallcrisis,1 point,Sun May 31 06:35:51 2015 UTC,"Well, that would be impossible not to have a big military operation, considering you have 100,000 people being infected with T-virus that it would spread onward to others. This would have been a big military operation to be necessary. In real-life riots, you would normally have at least more than 1,000 soldiers with heavy equipment to contain them, as happened in Detroit 1967 and Los Angeles 1992. This shouldn't be realistically impossible for the U.S. Army in Raccoon City. Maybe it's either a secret to send such a small contingent of troops or the Pentagon underestimate the situation."
residentevil,37t5mp,potzdamn,1 point,Sun May 31 23:38:39 2015 UTC,"The government didn't treat the incident as it should've because they wanted to hide their involvement with it.   Only the National Guard participated in civilian evacuation efforts. Not counting Delta Force's mission the Army merely sent in a single investigation unit with the rest of its personnel focused on the blockade. Once they incurred casualties at the blockade itself, they backed off after confirming the death of most of the population."
residentevil,37p3m2,ImperialToast29,8,Fri May 29 07:57:42 2015 UTC,"The stock is based off a FN SCAR, while the body and magazine are based off the M249 SAW.

residentevil,37p3m2,tafferling,1 point,Fri May 29 12:22:39 2015 UTC,So it is just a mash up of weapons. I think the body/mag is a combination of the 240B and 249 Saw. It's thicker than the 240B but the ammo box is farther forward like on the 240.
residentevil,37p3m2,NoxiousStimuli,3,Sat May 30 00:29:57 2015 UTC,It looks like a M240B had a one night stand with a SCAR.
residentevil,37p3m2,Troybylt,2,Fri May 29 12:16:06 2015 UTC,Doesn't appear to have a real life counterpart but I would say it looks quite a bit more like a M240 Gulf than a M249 SAW.
residentevil,37p3m2,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Fri May 29 11:11:06 2015 UTC,It kinda looks like an M249 SAW without the bipod. I'm not that gun-savy though so if anyone comes along with a better answer that would be appreciated as well.
residentevil,37p3m2,tafferling,1 point,Fri May 29 09:47:30 2015 UTC,Fairly certain that it's based off a SAW or a cross of that an an H&K MG4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_MG4  Never did quite get why they can't just use real weapon references at all times. I had to break my brain over what types of weapons showed up in RE6 to match them with proper names for a fic project.
residentevil,37p3m2,tafferling,2,Fri May 29 10:44:01 2015 UTC,"Alright so I think the final verdict is it has the butt of a SCAR, and then it's basically an MG4 with the ammo box just a little far forward.

Never was there the frustration of having too few bullets for enemies that were sweeping you, and you didn't have to worry about your partner.

It scared the hell out of me back then more than once. So when I first popped in remake I was expecting it to be there, but instead just a sound and the glass cracking. It wasn't an ""Oh Shit!"" moment, but more of an ""oh shit..."" moment, if that makes sense. Like, a ""what are they gonna do"" kind of looming danger, making me realize that despite it seeming like the original in many ways, it is in fact different, and I have no idea what they are going to throw at me. They know what I'm expecting, and they're going to use my knowledge of the first game against me. So the dogs not crashing in was my first ""oh shit"" moment in remake.

So I was a pretty veteran player.  My friend had told me about the Crimson Heads and that you had to burn them. In one of the first hallways you go through with the mirror at the far end, there is a Crimson Head that is ""dead"" at the very start of the game. I stood there for a minute just watching his head to see if it turned. Maybe he was faking. Nope, hes dead.  I come to the safe room with the kerosene and think ""Ah here we go. I can burn that dead one so I don't have to fight him later""  So I head back, kneel down to burn him and NOPE. HE GETS THE FUCK UP. I scream, run away and start unloading on this guy with the pistol and finally kill him with all of 3 bullets left.

The exception is Alexia, who could revert to human form at will until damage caused her to mutate into a second form. There was no going back then.  Birkin didn't actually intentionally become a monster. He injected himself hoping that he would become a G-Human (like Sherry in BIO6 only with superhuman strength too). However, the G-Virus was incomplete and unstable, thus monster.  It's unknown whether Albert would've reverted to human form. He overdosed on the Uroboros Virus, so despite being an adapter, it ravaged his body. Whether or not adapters are able to heal themselves and metabolize the superfluous pustules is unknown."

The Tyrant R also recognized Carter as a threat to its life, and killed him for it. This risk is the consequence of retaining intelligence."

I thought out of all of the villians we'd encountered in Resident Evil, he would be the one who wouldn't be that desperate. I guess I just didn't like how Capcom wrote his character for Resident Evil 5. The whole Spencer wanting to be a God, and causing the human race to evolve through viruses thing. I didn't mind him when he was red/gold-eyes Wesker, that was pretty fun, if a little Dragonball Z-ish when he fights Chris and Jill.

He seemed wayyyy too happy about it."
residentevil,37iwqf,News_Bot,2,Thu May 28 00:01:10 2015 UTC,Neil is super happy after being injected with the Uroboros Virus too after some initial griping. It's likely that the viruses/Plaga affect the mind in such a way that they simply don't get upset about the new form. Neil becomes extremely aggressive and full of bloodlust which translates into a feeling of internal power.

residentevil,37aaf1,chofortu,6,Tue May 26 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily supporting the idea that it's one of the best video games ever made, I'm just opposing the idea that it is ""horrendous garbage"""
residentevil,37aaf1,ScruffsMcGuff,4,Tue May 26 13:57:55 2015 UTC,"I loved RE4 and it was a well crafted game but it didn't and still doesn't feel like a Resident Evil game.  It feels like a spin off.  RE1+2+3+0+CV, etc are the real RE games, these third person action variations are spin offs.  Hell even Survivor and Dead Aim felt more like Resident Evil games to me than 4 did."
residentevil,37aaf1,SilentBobVG,4,Tue May 26 13:58:21 2015 UTC,"a cheap action game meant to appeal to the COD crowds   Call of Duty 2 wasn't even out whenever RE4 came out, and the first Call of Duty wasn't even that popular.  That's not a valid comparison at all."
residentevil,37aaf1,deathday,3,Tue May 26 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"Comparing Resident Evil 4 to Call of Duty? You lost me, bud."
residentevil,37aaf1,RubyLight,-5,Tue May 26 16:12:53 2015 UTC,I didn't compare Resident Evil 4 to COD. I merely said that RE4 was meant to appeal to the type of person who enjoys COD.
residentevil,37aaf1,IAmTriscuit,2,Tue May 26 15:52:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should look up what the word ""comparison"" means."

residentevil,37aaf1,3dRat,3,Tue May 26 15:54:23 2015 UTC,yet is unfair compare 4 with 6
residentevil,37aaf1,arikv2,6,Tue May 26 14:24:33 2015 UTC,"If this sells, then 2HD is next on the list."
residentevil,37aaf1,News_Bot,17,Tue May 26 15:55:00 2015 UTC,"Don't bet on it. You can't just upscale BIO2 into HD. You have to completely remake it, and that requires the budget of a whole new game. CAPCOM have a love for HD Remasters now because they are comparatively cheap."
residentevil,37aaf1,were_only_human,3,Tue May 26 04:45:27 2015 UTC,"Seriously. People seem to keep forgetting in this sub that REHD was already remade in the early '00s, and THAT was upscaled. Doing that for RE2 would be awesome, but a completely new game."
residentevil,37aaf1,iPickled,2,Tue May 26 08:57:45 2015 UTC,"But couldn't the assets they use in a RE2 HD remake be used for RE3 HD as well? They could reuse models, maps, animations, etc. since it all takes place in the same city during the same time.  Wouldn't doing this almost kill two birds with one stone while also decreasing future workloads and increasing potential profit? I mean, it is Capcom. Since when have they been a stranger to recycling?"
residentevil,37aaf1,were_only_human,3,Tue May 26 15:25:12 2015 UTC,That's an interesting idea. Making a 2/3 grand remaster. However it would still have to be a brand new game at one point or another. Can't salvage those PSX assets and just plop them in HD.   But that's a really cool idea. TO KICKSTARTER!
residentevil,37aaf1,3dRat,3,Wed May 27 03:24:22 2015 UTC,but still should be a lot cheaper to make game than a new one like 7
residentevil,37aaf1,News_Bot,1 point,Wed May 27 03:48:06 2015 UTC,It depends on whether they want to do a 1:1 remake like the BIO1 remake or if they feel the need to expand the game to meet next generation expectations.
residentevil,37aaf1,3dRat,2,Tue May 26 15:56:22 2015 UTC,the only next generation that im interested on is VIRTUAL REALITY!!!
residentevil,37aaf1,langis_on,2,Tue May 26 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"And what's the difference between remaking re1 than remaking 2 and 3 for the next gen systems? Genuinely curious. They've already shown they're willing to REmake games in the past, why not now?"
residentevil,37aaf1,CFGX,10,Tue May 26 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"13 years is the difference. RE1 was remade 13 years ago. It was a very different Capcom, and when it didn't sell as well as they liked they fired the few competent people they had left."
residentevil,37aaf1,deathday,5,Tue May 26 11:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people seem to forget that REmake was done a long time ago and a RE2-remake would be a pretty enormous undertaking. My guess is that they just might aim for a RE4HD re-re-re-e-re-release next."
residentevil,37aaf1,Kallerdrengen,3,Tue May 26 11:34:06 2015 UTC,There's no need for another RE4 HD treatment. Some passionate fans are already re-doing all the textures in beautiful HD.
residentevil,37aaf1,langis_on,1 point,Tue May 26 11:47:21 2015 UTC,Could be enough I guess. Not that it sells any console copies but anyway. I guess RE might be tapped out for the moment then.
residentevil,37aaf1,CFGX,1 point,Tue May 26 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"If they redo RE4 again, let me run and gun at the same time.."
residentevil,37aaf1,eXtreme98,1 point,Tue May 26 18:09:17 2015 UTC,"And it shattered expectations this time around. I don't think it's a sure thing that we'll get re2 and 3 remakes, but it's definitely not out of the question"
residentevil,37aaf1,Zaeh,12,Tue May 26 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, it continues to amuse me that Capcom was shocked by the fact that a multiconsole + PC release outperformed a Gamecube exclusive.  It's almost as if it was their boneheaded decision to go exclusive with last-place (at the time) Nintendo that tanked sales, and not that players were tired of survival horror.  It really is a dead company walking full of clueless fuckbags."
residentevil,37aaf1,News_Bot,5,Tue May 26 11:49:06 2015 UTC,Capcom is the real Umbrella
residentevil,37aaf1,ShadowLeggy,2,Tue May 26 11:55:46 2015 UTC,"Remaking RE 2 or 3 is still the same overtaking as making a whole new game (not to mention the numerous problems from the side of game design).  Remake HD sold well for a HD remaster, but Capcom would need a full remake to sell multiple times of that, and considering that horror is still the niche that doesn't sell as well as action, it's going to continue to be a huge maybe."
residentevil,37aaf1,chofortu,1 point,Tue May 26 14:43:42 2015 UTC,The remake of BIO1 was made at a time when Shinji Mikami had a lot of freedom and was able to do it as a pet project. CAPCOM no longer allows such freedom to its developers. That's just one among many reasons.
residentevil,37aaf1,ShadowLeggy,-2,Tue May 26 12:03:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, they have the tools to make a moderately cheap REmake of RE2. Just use the format from RE1 REmake and use the skins and some maps from Darkside Chronicles. It doesn't have to be 100% brand-new next-gen, REmake looked fucking beautiful as it was even back as a Gamecube game. I know I might be making it sound easier than it actually is, but they certainly have quite a few resources already available to them."
residentevil,37aaf1,chofortu,2,Tue May 26 12:14:34 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't even compare. 99% of the work is already done with these remasters!  Making a video game, you need to consider the script, voice acting, writing and recording the music, gameplay scripting, months of QA, 3D modelling, texturing, story, level design, puzzle design, motion capture, animations... creating a remake still requires all of these things, except perhaps script, story, level and puzzle design. But even those things would almost certainly get an overhaul.  By contrast, remastering REmake and RE0 requires a small amount of 3D modelling and texturing, maybe a little bit of work on the rendering pipeline and porting over to the new consoles, and a new (shorter) round of QA. It's a no-brainer for Capcom to remaster RE0, especially considering how well the remaster of REmake did - the budget is so small that the return on investment is insane.  Besides, a remake of RE2 couldn't use the resources from Darkside Chronicles - they're too old now. If you wanted a fixed-camera, you would definitely need to create all the environments from scratch: the original models used for the background renders in REmake are of a higher fidelity than anything you'd get even today in a game with a free camera, let alone the 6-year-old Darkside Chronicles."
residentevil,37aaf1,ShadowLeggy,1 point,Tue May 26 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"I say it because even a no-budget fan group was able to use the resources I mentioned to make a decent looking pre-alpha. I'd assume if they can do it, then it most certainly is available for a huge company like Capcom to do it even better. I'm aware all the other stuff is needed so it's not as easy as I'm probably making it sound. But there's quite a few areas and characters they simply unarguably do have available to them, that have relatively good graphics. Like I said, it doesn't have to be completely beautiful next-gen, REmake looked amazing even before the HD upgrade. I'm just trying to say it doesn't have to be ""from scratch"" like everyone is trying to imply."
residentevil,37aaf1,Zaeh,1 point,Wed May 27 21:17:27 2015 UTC,"Sure, but these fan remakes are nowhere near the level of quality of something that could actually be released by Capcom. The fan remakes re-use resources from Chronicles which, like I said, could not be used in a retail game at this point, so the fact that they exist doesn't mean anything - all of those elements I listed above would still need to be redone for a Capcom-driven RE2make."
residentevil,37aaf1,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Thu May 28 06:24:44 2015 UTC,Well... they do. Just sayin'.
residentevil,37aaf1,tafferling,1 point,Thu May 28 06:30:00 2015 UTC,Remasters and remakes aren't the same thing. The sales of this or Remake HD won't probably affect the possibility of a remake of 2 or 3 at all. We'll probably be just getting more remasters if this sells.

residentevil,37aaf1,chofortu,5,Tue May 26 12:50:16 2015 UTC,Happy for this.  Never played this Resident Evil since it was limited to the GameCube and I hated the controller.  I look forward to running a new RE game I've never played.
residentevil,37aaf1,megafreakX48,4,Wed May 27 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"I'll be getting it as soon as it comes out. Hopefully there will be a physical copy too like Japan got. (Repeating myself here since I say this everywhere but I'm just THAT adamant) I just wish more people would stop focusing on the term ""remaster"" or ""remake"" and just think of this as what it really is. An enhanced port for a game that has been Nintendo exclusive for like 10+ years?? Something like that. But because it's not RE2 REmake then ""Screw Crapcom"" etc etc. This is a good thing. And it won't prevent RE2 from being made. If it doesn't happen, that's on Capcom. And I really hope they remake it. But not Re4ify it."
residentevil,37aaf1,OceanHeart,3,Tue May 26 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"We already knew it was coming, but still neat. Hopefully, this announcement leaves Capcom open for a more interesting RE reveal at E3 this year."

residentevil,37aaf1,thejewishkohneve,2,Wed May 27 03:38:23 2015 UTC,"Capcom is really playing it safe. Can't blame them though with their financial situation. They are compromising in order to give fans what they want. It shows that they are listening to the community, but it would still be nice to see them make some bolder moves in the  near future."
residentevil,37aaf1,windwaker910,5,Wed May 27 21:19:02 2015 UTC,They already said they wanna focus on remasters after seeing how profitable it was for REmake and the excitement surrounding DMC4.

residentevil,37aaf1,ScruffsMcGuff,2,Wed May 27 03:44:05 2015 UTC,Awesome. I can't wait to play this. But I also think there should be a remake for Resident Evil 2.

residentevil,37a6ut,Misukun,3,Tue May 26 03:01:19 2015 UTC,"It's understandably confusing. I'll see how well I can explain.  Revelations 1: No campaign co-op of any kind. Raid mode co-op is online only.  Revelations 2: Offline campaign co-op only. (On PS4, I've heard share play works as a workaround; haven't tried it.) Offline and online raid mode co-op.   That said, I highly recommend Raid mode co-op. It's great fun with a friend. Also, it's my opinion that the final raid mode mission in Revelations 1 is some of the best multiplayer RE ever made. They pretty much open up the entire ship to you, but many of the doors are locked. You have to explore around (and there are many alternate routes to take) until you can find enough keys to escape the ship. It's an amazing combination of classic and modern RE design that deserves to be played."
residentevil,37a6ut,MarkaliteMkII,2,Tue May 26 06:06:04 2015 UTC,"Revs1 doesn't have any co-op besides raid mode, and Revs2 only supports local co-op in the campaign. You can still play raid mode online, though."

residentevil,377dtz,pixel_illustrator,1 point,Mon May 25 14:12:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked for differences on this myself, but I believe it does. I have used both of these skills and even without Shield Chris is tanky as fuck. The Armor Up skill I believe affects all damage you take, and seeing as the Shield is technically an addition to the health bar I don't see why not. But if anyone can test this and confirm a result that would be helpful."
residentevil,377dtz,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Mon May 25 17:43:52 2015 UTC,"Cool, since I posted this I found one other gamefaqs post that echo'ed what you were saying but didn't provide any concrete evidence, I'm tempted to say it most likely does, which is awesome because it effectively gives a character with maxed Shield, Armor Up, and Health a total of 3165 HP, 565 of which can be regenerated when uninterrupted for 13 seconds.   I might be able to get Chris high enough to try this out and make certain myself. We'll see. I can imagine that if you were really set on being defense heavy you could throw a maxed out Magic Pixie and Auto Evade on him for a nearly indestructible build, but that's probably overkill and furthermore it eats up 5 of your 6 passive slots, which is too many when I consider the others I want as well. Evade cancel and Evade duration seem more valuable to me."
residentevil,377dtz,fourthwallcrisis,1 point,Mon May 25 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"I think it first checks for damage mitigation, then for a shield effect - I don't run the combo but it should work. I wouldn't max them out, personally, but they can be useful for a character you want to 5 star every mission with - especially code red where it can get difficult not to take damage."
residentevil,377dtz,Nechaev,1 point,Mon May 25 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"Why not max them out? If I'm planning on equipping them it doesn't make sense not to, it's not like you have a finite number of skill points in this game. And besides, I'll have to max them out to unlock inheritance anyways."

They seem to be in the same vein as yours, judging by the videos, although they were made a good 2-3 years ago so they're of lesser quality due to having lesser resources (and I'm probably a worse builder).

residentevil,373fw8,SilentBobVG,1 point,Sun May 24 18:36:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly I was just wondering how much ammo there is in the game, so I figured doing a competition like this and hoping somebody does a perfect knife-only run would be the best way to get my answer"
residentevil,373fw8,SilentBobVG,1 point,Mon May 25 09:51:49 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I think to actually make it a fair competition the knife should be relegated to a special weapon. If everyone just does a knife only run, then there's no challenge anymore. It'll basically just be a speedrun while picking up all the ammo you can."
residentevil,373fw8,ripperc100jr,1 point,Mon May 25 09:55:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm... that's a good point! Yeah, so I guess disallow the knife altogether, that'd make the most sense.  Although, you need to use it to cut through the cobwebs, right? Unless I guess you use the bazooka as Jill???

residentevil,373fw8,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon May 25 10:06:38 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Chris gets the flamethrower for that area
residentevil,373fw8,SilentBobVG,1 point,Mon May 25 10:40:37 2015 UTC,"Ok so quick input. Jill gets an EXTRA GUN (Granade Launcher) over chris. I don't think the GL should count towards the ammo points since chris can't get it. Obviously you can still use it, but that is ALOT of points (unless you are going to seperate the two)"
residentevil,373fw8,SilentBobVG,1 point,Sun May 24 18:38:45 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm letting people choose their character, but everyone's judged to the same standard. Since Jill gets a whole extra gun, you should probably choose her! But maybe someone has some weird reason for preferring Chris, in which case, they're free to try with him. It's the same with the difficulty. People are free to make their own mistakes (or prove us all wrong by doing something we never thought of!)"

residentevil,372s8i,theCleversleazoid,5,Sun May 24 12:44:57 2015 UTC,"Actually there was a quick time event. Hint: it determines the ending.   Although, if they are going to stick with QTE, it's not as bad if you get multiple ways to carry it out and each way results in something different."
residentevil,372s8i,iPickled,3,Sun May 24 13:53:23 2015 UTC,"Oooh yes, you're correct. Completely forgot about that. [Only done the one playthrough so far, didn't know about different endings, lucky I got the good one!]"

residentevil,372s8i,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun May 24 16:32:52 2015 UTC,"I actually never played that part out that way. I immediately swapped to Natalia to find the monster.  I think the stigma against QTEs is bloated entirely out of proportion. It was only really bad in 4. 5 toned it down a bit, and 6 gave you the option of turning them off completely. Granted, they would be better off with no QTEs at all, but it's really not a big deal."
residentevil,372s8i,LexCrunch,2,Sun May 24 21:08:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a staunch defender of QTEs in action games in general. But in RE, I think they symptomatic of a larger trend away from player choice. Rev2 is the first RE to have a bad ending since ... RE3? Unless I'm forgetting one. Anyway, I'm just happy to see the trend start to reverse."

residentevil,372s8i,Ryndis,1 point,Mon May 25 04:48:58 2015 UTC,"QTE's were mandatory for 5 unfortunately because they game took a serious/cinematic role. The game controls just wouldn't have been able to make the boss fights interesting without them. Even with them, they were still pretty sub par but oh well.  Ironically, 6 had the most and its control scheme allowed for the game to be cinematic without them. Which blows my mind as to why there were so god damned many in that game.  You're right about REV2 though, i'm so glad that shit is mostly gone."

residentevil,36uta1,culebrero,1 point,Fri May 22 09:19:59 2015 UTC,like open world thingy? that cannot be an RE anymore (although zombie holocaust mod for GTA 5 sounds good)
residentevil,36uta1,Billy_Pilgrim86,0,Fri May 22 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, though, the plotline itself reads like shitty fan fiction. Clones that try to destroy everything because they're butthurt a man doesn't love them? An airborne viral infection that somehow our heroes are immune to? A character that aids in a plot to kill the president of the United States but is never charged with treason because she was trying to help her sister? I mean, the plots of the RE series have never been airtight, but this really read like internet fan fiction.   Edit for clarity: I meant the plotline sections of the actual game read like bad fan fiction. Some of your edits I think would have been really interesting and possibly made for a better game. (More detail about Ada's organization, tangentially connecting to a Raccoon City plot, having Carla be Ada's twin, Killing Helena (that one is just a personal preference, though) )"
residentevil,36uta1,Zaeh,2,Fri May 22 13:53:48 2015 UTC,"Carla wanted to wreak havoc on the world as a revenge on Simmons, considering what he had done to her.  The heroes aren't immune to the airborne C-virus, you'll even have to evade it at multiple points and you're dead if you can't.  The thing with Helena is pretty legit though."
residentevil,36uta1,Billy_Pilgrim86,1 point,Fri May 22 17:27:46 2015 UTC,"Fair enough- it's been long enough since I played it through that I messed up a few bits in my recollection of the story. I completely switched around the Carla thing, I forgot Simmons made the Ada clone because he was hung up on her. I felt like the C-virus thing was inconsistent though....at the beginning, Leon and Helena were able to avoid it no problem despite almost everyone else in Tall Oaks (aside from the band of gun shop survivors), but you're absolutely right about avoiding the C-Virus clouds in China and from those bastards in the Cathedral."
residentevil,36uta1,Zaeh,2,Fri May 22 18:00:26 2015 UTC,"There's some gameplay and story segregation there so it wouldn't become too tedious, like how you won't get infected after being bitten by a zombie in the old games, but in-story, the characters are not immune to it."
residentevil,36uta1,tafferling,7,Fri May 22 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a Fan Fiction rewrite, more than a how the game could have been tweaked. I get it when people don't like the action focus of the game (me, I love it) or how they cringe at some of the writing (I cringe, then I grin, cause -- come on, it's RE. Cringy writing is a prerequisite!) - I don't really understand the ""How it should have been."" You wanted an entirely different experience from the one that was delivered. Too bad in that regard. Much like I didn't like the re-do of Thief in the Thief 4 reboot and could write up a novel on how I think it would have been better... moot point though.  That's just Fan Fiction. Nothing wrong with Fan Fiction. I adore Fan Fiction and could, and have, written up a storm on RE as well. Except  Fan Fiction in which Chris dies this Taffer believes to be bad Fan Fiction. But that's just me."
residentevil,36uta1,tafferling,1 point,Fri May 22 09:16:43 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but what parts would you say seemed like FF if I may ask, and what parts did you like? And it's not so much how it should have been, but how I would have done it based on what my impressions and theories were when I saw the first trailer.  Also, Chris doesn't die; Ada does, as well as Helena, and Ashley's father. Chris ""appears"" to die but is captured by Neo-Umbrella to be experimented upon, if that makes sense."
residentevil,36uta1,Muugle,1 point,Fri May 22 09:20:29 2015 UTC,"Allow me to rephrase. Any deviation from a game's (or book's or movie's) original story line proposed by a fan is considered ""fan fiction"" to me. Mostly because I have great respect for any writer's intent with their work... even if it ends up being shait. Prometheus and Riddley Scott, I am looking at you and BioWare and your Mass Effect 3 ending, you get an honourable mention too.  The same applies for RE6 on me. I loved it. To the point where I got riled up when Piers died. My coop partner can attest to that. There was a whole lot of ""no.. no.. wait.. no.. don't do it.. no.. NOO! PIERS STOP! GDAMNITKID"" happening on Skype.  I've got my own RE6 fan-verse too, one that looks a lot more grim and gruesome, but I wouldn't at any point say it would have worked better. It's just m. And that is that.  On your proposal: Helena was a nice addition. She introduced a firmer and more personal connection to Simmons through the Leon Campaign. So I wouldn't have liked to have her replaced by Claire (but that is personal preference, now isn't it?). And personal preference is what the rest is too. I liked the story as it was. Yes, I would have preferred more interaction between the characters as well, especially Leon and Chris and even Chris and Ada (not Clara). On Clara, man, I liked Clara and found her character incredibly tragic when I figured out what had happened. What Simmons did to her was revolting.   There could have also been a bigger focus on how commonplace bioterrorism is these days, and how it has the world by the scruff of its neck. Revisit the whole ""No Hope"" setting, if you must. That was one of the things that I attacked in my Fan Fiction and I had a whole lot of fun with it. The carpet bombing of Tall Oaks and the fog rolling through Tatchi alone deserve to receive more attention. Those were some true monstrous ""No Hope"" events.  I can't go ahead and comment on all your suggestions, that would take a lot of time. Like how I thought having it all start at Christmas (Edonia) was sorta nice too. Made Finn's death a tad more sad. Or how Jake being Wesker's son was quite nice. Makes him more human. And how Ada not being a main villain, but remaining her shadow agent self was great.   My biggest gripe is your suggestion on the rewriting of Ada's character, making her yet another labrat and tragic child. She was/is fine the way she is. More so the end battle.. RE6 already stretched wonky over-the-top scenes, but a horde of BOWs and last stand sort of fight would have even topped that. And not in the good way. Having it more localized and let armies take care of the bulk of the fighting off screen was, imho, a good choice for RE6. Consider the vast battle line drawn around the infected zones of Lanshiang, Tatchi and Tall Oaks.. we saw a glimpse of what it looks like in Edonia and had the honors of tagging along one of the squads involved in the battles. But that was enough. The rest can happen offscreen.  Anyway. Writing this was fun. Thanks for giving me the opportunity! :)  Oh and one last thing: -Make the game less linear and more open-world, which I feel was a big problem of RE6. So, yeah, open-world RE6. YES PLEASE. Don't think that will ever happen, but I'd be throwing my money at it. Hard."
residentevil,36uta1,tafferling,-4,Fri May 22 13:01:49 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't have been a horde of BOWs, but one giant BOW who is a combination of Simmons, Carla, and Ustanak.  But I appreciate the suggestion."
residentevil,36uta1,tafferling,1 point,Fri May 22 13:34:20 2015 UTC,"Well, simply by it being the actual release from the developers means it's not fan fiction...  But I think I understand what you mean"

The second article freely admits that it is just guessing that Resident Evil may make some kind of appearance at E3. Besides, I'm sure we'd all agree that the franchise is likely to feature in some capacity, just by sheer frequency of release, so this video really doesn't have any meaningful content!"
residentevil,36t4w6,chofortu,2,Thu May 21 22:51:17 2015 UTC,These were my thoughts exactly. It's pretty much 100% speculation.  You might as well have made a video exclaiming that there is going to be some video games announced at E3.

residentevil,36n9rd,Deadman24,4,Wed May 20 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, there are two Samurai Edge airsoft manufacturers: Tokyo Marui and WE Tech.    WE makes generic (Standard Model) Samurai Edges that are full metal. The only specific one they've made is Barry's. You can buy a couple of WE's generic Samurai Edge's (silver plated, basic, etc) and take them apart and cobble them together to make Wesker's. But there is no official Wesker model for either company.    TM makes generic and specific models that are high end heavy plastic. They make basic Samurai Edges as well as offering a couple versions for both Chris, Jill, and Barry. TM's are very expensive and are really more for collectors. Just for show.    WE guns are good guns for play, so if you are looking to field one, definitely get a WE tech gun, but the Samurai Edge you are looking at is a generic Standard Model. It doesn't belong to anyone specific.    Important though!! Be wary of buying from Evike.  I've been waiting a month and a half now for a gun and they've been no help. The order status is a mess and the customer service is awful. I would recommend buying somewhere else. I picked up the same gun you are looking at on Ebay for $80 and it works great    Edit: Weirdly enough I just got my first email in a month and a half today from Evike.

residentevil,36gqp8,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue May 19 08:48:34 2015 UTC,Without getting into computer specs you can get away with storage just using portable hardrives - Adobe Premiere allows the use of Scratch discs that is basically saving and rendering everything to the portable HDD so that it doesn't take up space on the internal hardrive.    I'm pretty sure other editing programs have that option. Having a computer that is fast enough to handle the program itself is another thing...

Would you go to a restaurants order some type of meal then walk in to the kitchen before you're food is done take it eat it then say it was under cooked or it sucked? I seen a review of a game from Ign I think it was from them don't remember but it was from a big review company which they reviewed a game that is in early access on steam which was fucking dumb the game was not even done.

Don't get me wrong with the steam reviews I'm  fine with them its not the same when it comes down reviewers who have people who read there reviews or watch for example totalbiscuit, ign, pc gamer, or gameTrailers. I don't  buy early access games I don't want to play a game that's unfinished and the people who do buy them yeah the steam reviews are good for them but that's it we cant have these big reviewers reviewing games that are not done.

I was a huge a fan of Silent Hill since age 10 or 11 and always thought for some strange reason that I could only be a huge fan of one or the other. I'd also heard from people at school that RE was terrible. Needless to say they were all imbeciles and so was I. Lol.  When I decided to do it I made sure to do it right too. I started with RE1 and worked my way up. Now I've played all the main titles and a few side ones. I wasn't the biggest fan of a couple but overall it's an amazing series and in a way I'm glad I waited, getting to experience an old school survival horror series for the first time is a rare treat nowadays."

He described the cover as this dude holding a gun, some spiders, and it seems pretty cool. I ask Mom, she says yes, fast forward an hour and here we are.  First door: ""you look /u/camp_lo because one of us has to""  First Zombie: ""I don't know how to attack!""  First truly difficult section: herbicide ""puzzle""  We were hooked.

We'd only recently got a PSX, and Alien Trilogy was getting boring after finishing it a couple of times, and Tomb Raider wasn't even out yet. Then one day my father came home from work with this game that had a crazy looking madman on the front. I asked him where he got it, and could I play?  He said a work mate lent it him, and no, I couldn't play it because it was an 18 rated game. [Hey, this was the mid-90's, and my parents have always been responsible adults] He'd let me watch a little bit, but if it was too violent/graphic, he'd turn it off and would wait until I was sent to bed to play it. Needless to say, after Richard's[?] head fell off, my Dad switched the console off and told me there was no way I was watching him play it.  After I was sent to bed, I snuck out of my room and watched him play it through the crack in the door to his study. I think he caught me watching once or twice heh. Eventually he relented, and let me play, but only when either himself or my mother was around to supervise, so to speak. I was obsessed, more so than with Tomb Raider when it eventually came out [which me and Dad would play together, taking in turns, solving puzzles together, fond memories], and they eventually bought me Resident Evil 2 for my 13th birthday, a month after it released in the UK.  I think I spent my entire 13th playing RE2. Not that I'm complaining mind. For some reason the part that sticks in my head most about that day was Sherry throwing shit through the airvent to Claire. I remember thinking, WOW, that girl is really good at throwing stuff without getting it jammed in the vent."

She bought it for me for PSX (found the game from some guy selling his stuff in the classifieds of a local newspaper, after buying a PSX for super cheap at a pawn shop).  I remember her proudly declaring that she got the game AND the PSX for cheaper than the game was listed at in stores new.  I also remember that I wanted to make her proud and show my thanks so I tried doing the laundry but I didn't know how to use the machine (I was 10 or 11 at the time and had never done laundry before) and ended up fucking something up and my dad had to fix the machine.

residentevil,36bh3z,EHoruto,9,Mon May 18 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"I'm in full agreement. Never understood why folks get thrown off and confused by the interlocking stories and the time gap between some of them. It was incredibly easy to follow and made the game so much more fun.  Each time meeting another pair that you'd just played with made me all giddy with joy.  I also found the slight variations in gameplay refreshing, ontop of the vast difference in setting and mood for each campaign.   Which one's your favorite? The Chris and Piers campaign is mine, though I found the Jake and Sherry campaign a lot more stylish and versatile. The backdrop music is so wonderfully 80th spymovie in that one :D"

residentevil,36bh3z,Metagenic,1 point,Mon May 18 22:09:40 2015 UTC,"Weren't melee attacks in RE4 and RE5 context-dependent? If I recall correctly you couldn't just walk up to an enemy and punch/kick them, you had to shoot/knife them in a weak point to give yourself the opportunity first."
residentevil,36bh3z,chan_jkh,1 point,Sun May 31 11:09:55 2015 UTC,"Walking up to an enemy in RE6 and using melee randomly was a bad idea because the non-context ones have no invincibility frames and do shit damage (a 3-hit combo wouldn't even kill most enemies and you just wasted 40% of your stamina bar).  In a crowd setting repeated melee means you'll quickly use up your stamina. When your stamina is completely depleted you can't sprint or do (useful) melee attacks for a period of time.  RE4 you'll have to be consistent with headshots and leg shots, but in both RE4 and 5 if you're handy with a handgun or machine pistol you can basically do one shot + melee forever."

residentevil,3633sd,Sissle,6,Fri May 15 19:06:24 2015 UTC,I have /u/ShadowLeggy to thank for introducing me to the entire resident evil series! I had no idea what it was until running across her videos! honestly I had non idea that video games could even be scary untill i saw her videos and got interested.
residentevil,3633sd,brutalkid12,6,Sat May 16 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"Happy to hear it, it's awesome knowing that some got into the series that way!"

residentevil,3633sd,InterwebCat,3,Sat May 16 03:37:06 2015 UTC,My favorite was one of the medley videos and the one part had Billy and Rebecca singing Let the Sun Shine. Shit had my cracking up all day long. I love leggys videos!

Around when ""I Think I Love You"" was uploaded, life got really busy being in school and getting married. I came back for that 5th episode of Survivor... But the community around my videos had gotten pretty belligerent, and I was having a hard time seeing anything past the bad stuff that was going on so I took a long hiatus.

residentevil,363vzo,shitcock55,-1,Fri May 29 23:38:55 2015 UTC,"Finding and downloading a save game would be your fastest bet, but really it takes 4hrs to run the campaign. RE4 is the best easiest and shortest RE game."
residentevil,363vzo,Troybylt,1 point,Sat May 16 11:07:06 2015 UTC,"Really? I would say RE2, RE5, REv, REv 2, and RE6 are all shorter than RE4."
residentevil,363vzo,EQUASHNZRKUL,-2,Sun May 17 11:57:43 2015 UTC,"What!? No way! Re4 the Ganados fell like wheat before the harvester,  and the puzzles put themselves together. Ammo and pesos were abundant as leaves.  The puzzles and combat hung me up in several points and health was always a concern.  Maybe I was just too good at RE4."
residentevil,363vzo,Troybylt,1 point,Sun May 17 12:46:17 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with your points, but I was done with RE5 in an AFTERNOON. RE6 took me an all-nighter (a seemingly eternal night). Maybe it's because I played RE4 at a much younger age that it felt longer..."
residentevil,363vzo,EQUASHNZRKUL,-1,Mon May 18 14:27:33 2015 UTC,How could you bare to play through RE 6? :/
residentevil,35zusi,Mr_s3rius,4,Thu May 14 22:16:12 2015 UTC,"A bit weak though. Most of Rev 2 isn't discounted, and neither is RE5: Untold Stories."
residentevil,35zusi,DoomDash,6,Thu May 14 22:17:38 2015 UTC,"Seriously untold stories for $15 is a joke (now), even worse that it isn't on sale. I love RE5 to death but no way am I giving them $15 for years old short DLC content when the game itself is typically cheaper or the same. Way to screw over people who purchased RE5 way back in the day for full price."
residentevil,35zusi,DrHoenybun,2,Thu May 14 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"Yea. The two games I've been looking to buy are Untold Stories and Rev 2.  As you said, 15$/€ for RE5:US is way too much. And the discount on Rev 2 makes me feel like they're trying to deceive me. They give a great 50% discount only on Ep1. This doesn't even translate into the complete bundle. :(  Well, the summer sale is coming soon. My guess is we're looking at bigger discounts then."
residentevil,35zusi,LexCrunch,2,Fri May 15 00:14:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the summer sale is coming soon. My guess is we're looking at bigger discounts then.   Good Luck, This is the Cheapest 4/6/Revelations (one) has been since there release on steam. I could see these three games going down to the price they are at and not further. As per Rev. 2 I wouldn't see any more 10% off at most even during the sale. Revelations (one) wasn't discounted in Resident Evil Sale for a couple of years."
residentevil,35zusi,DrHoenybun,2,Fri May 15 00:52:30 2015 UTC,"4/5/6/Rev1 have really good discounts. Getting any of these games for 7-10 bucks is great I think.  I meant RE5:US and Rev 2 when I said I was looking for better prices. Untold Stories isn't discounted at all and Rev 2 is a whopping 3€ off.  If I remember correctly, Capcom always participates in summer and winter sales and usually does pretty good discounts."
residentevil,35zusi,DoomDash,1 point,Fri May 15 01:00:22 2015 UTC,Recent releases don't usually get discount prices on Steam during sales.
residentevil,35zusi,DrHoenybun,0,Fri May 15 03:52:27 2015 UTC,"Actually in the summer and winter sales. The Resident Evil games never dipped below 50% off. This is the first time that 4 in under 10 and 6 is at 10. Why do people care about 5... still sucks either way. XD, and for Rev 2. It just came out. It took years before Rev 1 was anything more than 5$ off."
residentevil,35zusi,JoeKrauzer,1 point,Fri May 15 02:40:31 2015 UTC,"I must be wrong then. I thought I picked up Rev 1 and RE5 during one of the summer/winter sales.  I like 5. Playing through it with a friend is quite fun. I think it's better than 6, at the very least."
residentevil,35zusi,theowest,1 point,Fri May 15 09:47:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, RE:R2 is priced pretty reasonable for how new it is."

residentevil,35zusi,Magikarp_13,3,Fri May 15 00:50:43 2015 UTC,"I'm probably the only one disappointed that Operation: Raccoon City isn't on sale.  It's the only one I don't have on PC, and I thoroughly enjoyed it on 360.  Please don't hurt me."
residentevil,35zusi,Mydst,2,Fri May 15 16:52:09 2015 UTC,I'm worried I won't find anyone to play it with.
residentevil,35zusi,Muugle,1 point,Fri May 15 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"Hopefully one day it will be on sale and I can pick it up.  The 360 took a tumble during some puppy shenanigans and is not functional.  I loved the game, but I definitely know it is not worth $30."
residentevil,35zusi,a_evenstar,2,Fri May 15 20:11:43 2015 UTC,"Really, the Resi 5 DLC isn't discounted?  Asking £12 for it after this much of a delay is a joke."
residentevil,35zusi,Gmundy,1 point,Fri May 15 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"I've never played a Resident Evil game in my life, where would I start? (on PC obviously)  There are so many options between the sequels and the remakes I have no idea which game I would even start with."
residentevil,35zusi,a_evenstar,1 point,Fri May 15 08:34:53 2015 UTC,"Hm, story-wise, the best entry points would probably be Resident Evil 1: HD Remaster or Resident Evil: Revelations.  RE1 is the beginning of the entire series and it's a rather classic survival horror (although the HD Remaster has a few more areas, enemies, items, etc. So it's not quite the original).  RE: Revelations 1 is kind-of a side-story to the main RE plot. It features the same characters but knowledge of the mainstory is not really required. It's somewhat more action-orientated third-person game and plays very different to RE 1.  So if you'd like a slower-paced atmospheric horror game, go for RE 1. If you'd like a more shooty horror game, go for Revelations."
residentevil,35zusi,Muugle,1 point,Fri May 15 09:42:54 2015 UTC,Errrrr start with 1?
residentevil,35zusi,a_evenstar,1 point,Fri May 15 15:32:06 2015 UTC,How is the RE4 Ultimate HD edition? I have the other RE games on steam but I never really heard any positive / negative feedback about the recently released RE4. Thanks!
residentevil,35zusi,laterolus,3,Fri May 15 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"Someone gifted it to me on steam and I'm enjoying it so far. 60 FPS is drool worthy.   It does take some getting used to not having a controller in my hand (cba setting up a controller :P), but the controls are pretty manageable. Since you have other RE games on Steam, I assume you won't have any issues :D   TL;DR: If you love RE4, then get it on sale, duh."
residentevil,35zusi,a_evenstar,1 point,Fri May 15 14:38:45 2015 UTC,ok good to hear! I'll get it! i loved the wii controller RE4 version.
residentevil,35zusi,Morbidius,2,Fri May 15 15:40:13 2015 UTC,It's great. Played through it 3 times.
residentevil,35zusi,LordRahl1986,1 point,Fri May 15 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"awesome, good to hear there are no major bugs or negatives about the game."
residentevil,35zusi,lolhaibai,2,Fri May 15 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"Its pretty well polished, beatable with mouse and keyboard but you can easily plug in an xbox360 controller. Gameplay is pretty smooth however i did find having some issues learning some of the keybinds as far as moving gear around the briefcase.  I strongly recommend picking it up."

residentevil,35zusi,GILLHUHN,-1,Sun May 17 18:04:36 2015 UTC,I want to get the REmake but I'm not sure I'd really like to pay $10 for it. But at the same time I really want it.
residentevil,35zusi,stak640,2,Thu May 14 23:57:20 2015 UTC,"Remake is worth $15, go for it"
residentevil,35zusi,Zaeh,1 point,Fri May 15 00:26:23 2015 UTC,I think I'm going to I'm just debating between that and Revelations 2.
residentevil,35zusi,stak640,1 point,Fri May 15 02:18:23 2015 UTC,"If your more of a fan of the earlier games, def get REmake. If the later games, Rev2 might be more up your alley.  Just FYI - Rev1 is my 2nd fav RE game; after RE2. I think REmake would be the better buy. I own REmake and Rev2."
residentevil,35zusi,Zaeh,1 point,Fri May 15 02:23:04 2015 UTC,Honestly I have never really played RE 1-3 I started at 4 and fell in love I tried playing the older games but the graphics and controls always turned me off. I hear the controls were updated in REmake I wonder if I'd enjoy it more
residentevil,35zusi,DrHoenybun,0,Fri May 15 02:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can do without tank controls in REmake RE-RElease (lol)  If you never played the older ones, then REmake is even more the better choice IMO. Having not played the originals, you'll never find a better 'old school' RE game than REmake. Not in controls, visuals gameplay, etc. And it's scary 👻 👻 👻  But, being you only played the later games - Rev2 is the safer choice.  I dunno, that's all I can leave you with. The choice is up to you. But obviously, my suggestion is REmake.  Whatever you choose, I hope you enjoy it :D"
residentevil,35zusi,stak640,1 point,Fri May 15 02:38:11 2015 UTC,The new 'analog' controls are arguable worse than the tank controls though.
residentevil,361b68,pguyette,2,Fri May 15 06:53:33 2015 UTC,I just picked up the game.  I'll search you when I'm ready.  Honestly maybe in a week or so.

residentevil,360z33,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat May 16 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"I have never used a sniper in raid mode and never will, so already you can tell we have very contrasting playstyles lol.  I'm already end game. I play on a level 100 Moira and use these passive skills: HP mastery, Shield, Evade Cancel, Assault Rifle Mastery (which I geared out to essentially be a rapid-fire sniper rifle), SMG mastery (because homing ammo is OP), and Crouch Power.  For Active Skills I use Stealth, Invincibility, Shockwave, and Bewilder. There's a good chance I get rid of Shockwave for Decoy Bottle though, as I'm not getting much real usage out of it in Code Red anymore."
residentevil,35z49m,ARJared,11,Thu May 14 18:52:52 2015 UTC,I'd still consider both Operation Raccoon City and Gaiden worse games. At least Dead Aim tries.
residentevil,35z49m,Zaeh,2,Thu May 14 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Dead Aim is pretty poo-poo, but it's far from the worst.  Also, aiming is pretty tough, but it was meant to be played with a light gun. You also have a 180 turn to help navigate a bit easier, and a stupid exploitable dodge move to make you invincible to everything."
residentevil,35z49m,LexCrunch,1 point,Thu May 14 21:30:17 2015 UTC,ORC will be the worst Resident Evil game ever in my book.

residentevil,35z49m,ironic-triforce,2,Fri May 15 04:46:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not my proudest opinion, but something about ORC clicks with me."

residentevil,35z49m,Delition,2,Sat May 16 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"You two rock. Glad to see others who just enjoyed ORC for what it was. A chance to go back through Raccoon and see things from a different perspective. The gameplay was pretty well put together, yeah there were a few buggy bits here and there, but no more than most games put out by a less than well known developer.  But hey-ho, franchise fans will be rather hard-headed at times ;)"
residentevil,35z49m,Zaeh,2,Mon May 25 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"Ha, my thoughts exactly"
residentevil,35z49m,Delition,-3,Sun Jun 7 05:16:35 2015 UTC,I liked Gaiden.  ORC and the first Revelation were what caused me to stop buying any RE games.  Still boycotting RE6.  Thought Dead Aim was a lot of fun with the Guncon.
residentevil,35z49m,Zaeh,0,Fri May 15 01:23:43 2015 UTC,"One might argue that if ORC made you stop buying the games in the series and you boycotted 6, Revelations would've been a step in a favorable direction."
residentevil,35z49m,Samanoskue,2,Fri May 15 01:37:47 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the gameplay, I will admit, but I severely disliked all of the new characters and the storyline in general.  It felt like nothing actually happened in the course of the story.  Unfortunately the gameplay alone wasn't enough for me to want to keep up with the series.  Not trying to sound too whiny, I just felt let down (and this is from someone who liked pretty much every other game in the series)."

residentevil,35z49m,icebear518,3,Fri May 15 04:44:40 2015 UTC,"I love Dead Aim and yet I'm not sure why. I guess it's a combination of both how cheap and simple it feels but also because of its dream-like, vague qualities in terms of the cutscenes, music, and locations."

It still held up pretty well to the idea I had of it in my head. The setting was cool, the inventory system was interesting and the enemies were fun to blast across hallways.  The only real downside is that I beat it in like an hour and 40 minutes, and that was with exploration and lots of me wandering around not knowing where to go.  Solid game, very enjoyable but a little too short."

residentevil,35v9qt,snezima23,1 point,Thu May 14 11:39:16 2015 UTC,"That's a really cool collectible (or group of collectibles I guess). I'm surprised I've never heard of it.  I believe the two extra disc slots are probably for future games in the series like Resident Evil 4, or maybe Resident Evil Survivor if you feel like a masochist."
residentevil,35v9qt,sbfaught,2,Thu May 14 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I have a copy of Survivor that I broke because the game is so awful. I could put it in there.  It is a fucking cool collectible though."
residentevil,35v9qt,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Thu May 14 00:57:29 2015 UTC,"They need to make something like this today with every RE game. The RE6 anthology comes close but it just has download codes for everything (except RE6), and it doesn't include Remake, Zero or Code: Veronica.  edit: found the 15th Anniversary Collection but it has even less than the 5th Anniversary Collection."
residentevil,35v9qt,Captainoep,1 point,Thu May 14 00:34:07 2015 UTC,"The 15th Anniversary Collection is something I'd like to get at some point, but I'm bigger on collecting physical merch than the games themselves, as I only like 0-4 and have them all on NGC. It would be cool to get a similar limited edition for the 20th anni though."

residentevil,35w1c4,DoomDash,8,Wed May 13 23:56:46 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with the first one.  It worked as sort of a fanfic-prequel to the games (it was released before zero). Despite one or two moments that I found over-the-top moments (notably Alice's neckbreaking in the sewers and the dog kick), Alice was at least still human and vulnerable. My biggest gripe would probably be that they killed way too many people with the laser hallway (like, half the team died before the zombies even got out).  Then they gave Alice superpowers and went off in their own direction while turning her into the biggest Mary Sue in existence. Screw the rest of the movies."
residentevil,35w1c4,chan_jkh,6,Thu May 14 11:43:42 2015 UTC,"What attracted me to resident evil as a franchise was the seedy underbelly of using a virus as a weapon. Not just the eerie setting of the first mansion or a gritty raccoon city decimated by a zombie outbreak. It was the feeling i got reading the journals in re1, seeing the grubby lab, reading wesker report 2, the music of each area, opening that door to a hallway that may have someone or something waiting for me and the giant conspiracy of umbrella with its ungodly acts.   The movies never gave me that feeling, not once.  No one was more hyped than me for that first film. Seeing them skip the mansion in a blink of an eye made me immediately  look at my best mate watching it with me as if someone had just shot my family.   They missed the ball completely with the films."
residentevil,35w1c4,Deadcellz,4,Thu May 14 18:08:50 2015 UTC,I like the first. That is all. I like Degeneration too; but different franchise/universe/whatever.
residentevil,35w1c4,stak640,3,Thu May 14 02:53:00 2015 UTC,1-3 are watchable. 4 and 5 make me want to rip my hair out. Fuck Alice.
residentevil,35w1c4,hercoldhands,1 point,Sun May 17 08:38:04 2015 UTC,Alice just destroys the whole movie. Give me Jill and Ada! Those women know how to act without being so over-the-top AND they fit the characters they are based on so well.
residentevil,35w1c4,alohamitsu,2,Tue May 19 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"I can't get into them because I'd need to disassociate them from Resident Evil games, they're not the same thing at all, which is fine - but that's impossible when they keep using stuff from the game."
residentevil,35w1c4,fourthwallcrisis,2,Thu May 14 02:03:32 2015 UTC,I don't really care for the live action movies.  Movies based on games almost universally suck but that's a gripe about cinema.  The cgi movies made by capcom were much better (having a game company making a movie about a game seems to have better results.)  Damnation was the better of the two and I'd like to see another one down the road.  Maybe use different characters this time.
residentevil,35w1c4,kikaider007,3,Thu May 14 03:04:52 2015 UTC,I actually legitimately thought the Silent Hill movie was fantastic.
residentevil,35w1c4,DerClogger,3,Thu May 14 05:04:05 2015 UTC,It was enjoyable at least. Pyramid Head tearing that person's skin off and throwing it at the church is so metal.
residentevil,35w1c4,hercoldhands,1 point,Thu May 14 05:18:29 2015 UTC,"I heard the director of the SH movie (first one) made his crew play the game and thats why the movie was so good. Not sure if true, but if it is, then it makes a lot of sense."
residentevil,35w1c4,kikaider007,0,Sun May 17 08:40:09 2015 UTC,Imagine if kojima worked on a cgi silent hill movie in a similar manner as RE damnation.
residentevil,35w1c4,call_me_canvas,2,Thu May 14 05:54:39 2015 UTC,"I'll defend those movies till I die!!! But yeah, same as you really, they are just a guilty pleasure sort of thing. I know they're bad, but I just watch them for the action and because they're Resident Evil, even if they are totally different from the games. That being said, I didn't like Afterlife as much mainly because there was SO MUCH slow-motion, but it was okay."
residentevil,35w1c4,call_me_canvas,1 point,Thu May 14 04:15:24 2015 UTC,"Was that the one that was all about the 3D effects? If it was, I think I saw that in theaters, in 3D, so the slow motion was kind of cool, albeit gimmicky."

I'll still watch them :)   Really loved the first one though.. but I have to admit I was introduced to the RE franchise in the wrong order. Books, movie, then games."

residentevil,35w1c4,SuperGanondorf,2,Fri May 15 02:33:15 2015 UTC,They're absolutely terrible. Why do I like them so much?
residentevil,35w1c4,biclighterburns,2,Fri May 15 03:36:12 2015 UTC,"I actually liked the Resident Evil films, both the CGI ones and the live action ones. It was a pretty cool take on the RE universe. Sure, the movie franchise went on longer than it should, but I still enjoy the fights"
residentevil,35w1c4,joel_a,2,Fri May 15 07:42:25 2015 UTC,"They're absolutely horrible, but they're just so stupidly over-the-top fun that I don't really care if they're bad. I love these movies to death; even if the quality of the writing and acting are terrible, the action is so over-the-top and adrenaline-pumping it's worth seeing.  If you go in expecting something that actually even makes an attempt at being like the games, you'll be disappointed. If you go in for a stupid, over-the-top action flick, it fulfills every expectation."
residentevil,35w1c4,RinkuTheFirst,2,Fri May 15 22:09:02 2015 UTC,"The Resident Evil movies are terrible. They should either be put to rest or given to a competent director. I would watch a Uwe Boll directed RE movie before I watch another Paul W.S. Anderson one. That said, the first one is the most bearable, mostly for its really dated style. It just reminds me of being young and watching shitty movies at the cinema."

The second was mediocre but not terrible, and the fifth... well, honestly, I hated the fifth.  I do want to see the sixth when it comes out, but I hope that after a few years, they come out with a new live-action series that doesn't deviate as much from the games as the current series does."
residentevil,35w1c4,KevinLee487,1 point,Tue May 19 05:27:21 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I was content with it the first movie and the second movie, but the rest just get more and more terrible with the storylines. Honestly, I am so sick and tired of hearing ""My name is Alice"" we are about five movies in, I THINK we ALL would know what your name is by now, not only that but her character is just plain annoying at this point. Had it not been for the wonderful choices they made with Ada and Jill (perfect acting and portrayal of the characters) I would not have lasted very long with the movies, everyone else just sucks. And don't even get me started on the terrible fanfiction-like stories lol. Sorry for being so harsh on what you love, its just my opinion on it, hope you wont take it too seriously."

residentevil,35w1c4,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:00:29 2015 UTC,"They're B-tier action movies with a bit of a zombie/horror flavor.   As a whole they tell a pretty odd, uneven story.   It's fanfiction."
residentevil,35w1c4,LexCrunch,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"I really liked the first movie with its subtle references to the games. It's a really fun movie on its own, too.  The second one was far and away the worst because of its spastic camera and total butchering of the canon characters. This was when I realized that the franchise was just an AU fanfiction. Once I rolled with that, the rest of the movies all became more fun, but I still hate the second for making me dizzy."
residentevil,35w1c4,wrathborne,1 point,Thu May 14 01:24:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I would have liked if it was more true to the games.
residentevil,35w1c4,wrathborne,2,Thu May 14 05:06:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a problem with it doing its own thing in a familiar world, but it took familiar characters and settings in the second movie and totally raped them. I didn't like that."

residentevil,35q6hn,Zaeh,-3,Tue May 12 17:31:48 2015 UTC,Where do you get that when they did it for RE1?
residentevil,35q6hn,thefancykyle,6,Tue May 12 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"They didn't. RE 1 was completely remade back in 2002, for the Gamecube, and that was remastered. They didn't remaster the PS1 original."
residentevil,35q6hn,Zaeh,2,Tue May 12 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"and no one would expect them to remaster the originals as they wouldn't add anything and it may receive negative response, the concept of making a remaster is to update it and add something, in the case of RE1 it was adding the Lisa Trevor story, for RE2 you could go more indepth for Ada or Hunk, hell even Sherry."
residentevil,35q6hn,thefancykyle,5,Tue May 12 18:42:20 2015 UTC,"Remastering isn't the same as remaking, I think you're not understanding that here.  The 2002 GC remake of the first RE was a full remake, made from the ground up, and 70% new. A remaster, or an HD port, is just minor graphical improvements, a new platform and optionally a little bit of new content. PS1 games such as RE 2 and 3 cannot be just HD remastered, as they're so low quality.  Newer games can be, and Capcom has done it with a plethora of Resident Evil titles already. That's what they're talking about in the article, not about actual remaking - that's why this doesn't have anything to do with PS1 titles like 2 and 3."
residentevil,35q6hn,constar90,2,Tue May 12 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"gotcha, yea I wasn't reading that back properly."

residentevil,35q6hn,constar90,6,Tue May 12 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"By the success of the Remake HD alone, no. A full remake of RE 2 or 3 would still be the same as making a new game, and Capcom won't probably be taking that risk with an actual survival horror game.  Not to mention that the heavy hitters from back the in the day are gone, so Capcom would most likely have significant trouble on the game design part of remaking those two as well."

residentevil,35t4my,cayal3,2,Wed May 13 07:56:58 2015 UTC,The trapdoor can only be opened from the bottom. You need to go through the underground tunnels (after Barry abandons you and takes off in the elevator) and use the broken flamethrower to get to Lisa's bedroom and get the stone ring. Then you go up the ladder and unlock the trapdoor from below to return to the cabin.

residentevil,35lhyq,chofortu,10,Mon May 11 14:07:15 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that they still don't like the serial format. But it really is good. You can get the core episodes for $25 or the full game for $40 which is still an absolute steal in 2015. And the serial format allows you to try out the game. I could buy 1 episode for $5, and back off if I don't like the game. I can't tell you how much I wish I could have done that with RE6 or ORC instead of wasting my money."
residentevil,35lhyq,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Mon May 11 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"yep, RE6 was 60 bucks IIRC (and I hated it!!! xD)"
residentevil,35lhyq,culebrero,6,Wed May 13 00:11:56 2015 UTC,Awesome! Makes me sad that they didn't give the game more of a budget.
residentevil,35lhyq,AWorldW-OShrimp,2,Mon May 11 15:10:10 2015 UTC,"From what I've played, it's wonderful. Maybe a bigger budget may have had made them be more ambitious and then we'd have the RE6 of the revs."
residentevil,35lhyq,soliddewitt,4,Mon May 11 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"Revelations 2 was excellent, but you could tell that the budget was fairly barebones thanks to the short chapters and sometimes wacky graphics. Claire 4 in particular stands as clear evidence that Capcom did not give this team much to work with. I'd trust these guys to handle a somewhat larger budget without getting carried away."
residentevil,35lhyq,AWorldW-OShrimp,1 point,Mon May 11 16:30:02 2015 UTC,reducing Clair's nose would have been cheap anyway (joking...... maybe not)
residentevil,35lhyq,culebrero,3,Wed May 13 00:15:54 2015 UTC,"Really happy to hear it was successful. Revelations 2 absolutely deserves its success.   I've put over 100 hours into the game, and it cost me only $40 new. And if I had gone digital only, it would have cost a mere $25. That's insane to me. If this is what a smaller budget results in, please keep the budgets of future REs small."
residentevil,35lhyq,MarkaliteMkII,3,Mon May 11 17:58:30 2015 UTC,"I am not a huge fan of the episodic style, but this game is great. I just waited until they were all out to play it, and it's great fun with a friend. Revelations 2 did a really great job of making co-op work. I loved RE5 co-op, but I think the asymmetricality of Rev 2 was genius."

residentevil,35lhyq,lskennedy,1 point,Mon May 11 14:24:07 2015 UTC,"When the game first came out I was super angry and appalled by it being digital-only and episodic (and at first I thought it was actually one of those retarded visual novel games, I was so glad to be wrong).   Then a physical version came out for $40 and all was right in the world once again. 120+ hours into the game so far (90% of that being in raid mode...)"
residentevil,35lhyq,EHoruto,1 point,Mon May 18 18:27:02 2015 UTC,"They also cut some corners in production -- there are literally glitches that prevent PC players from finishing the game and console players from using certain raid mode maps. This game is very enjoyable (and well worth it with raid mode being included), but I miss the days of the RE series being well-polished and leading the pack. They need to ditch that graphics engine, polish up the delivery, and get back on top."
residentevil,35lhyq,andycpsu,2,Mon May 11 16:45:30 2015 UTC,glitches that prevent PC players from finishing the game    Like what?
residentevil,35lhyq,andycpsu,2,Mon May 11 16:55:47 2015 UTC,"End boss fight isn't doable when you enter the door, character control glitches. Happened to both me and a friend and we worked around it (there are tons of things to try to get it to work) -- we put hours into rerunning shit so this glitch wouldn't keep us from completing the game. Also a followup glitch can happen after this boss fight where you once again lose all character control. Just not the kind of thing I like to see from a once legendary developer. Not saying I didn't enjoy the game, just saying I am being way more careful with my preorders for capcom games as they have a bad modern track-record."
residentevil,35lhyq,REsoleSurvivor1000,3,Mon May 11 17:28:09 2015 UTC,Preordering in general is a bad idea. It makes room for incomplete games being sold at full price and without a demo run or a pre-play or anything of the sort I am skeptical towards the concept.
residentevil,35lhyq,tafferling,-1,Mon May 11 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"I picked up the game on the PC originally, but couldn't make it past the first chapter. Frame-rate drops, clunky controls, horribly STIFF characters. Playing Claire felt like navigating a stick with more sticks for legs. Not even the familiar over-the-top writing that I adore so much about RE helped. Guess the RE5 and RE6 ports spoiled me good.   And then I got it on the PS4 and had the pleasure of playing through most of it with a friend. Still stiff as hell, but it redeemed itself with the great dynamic between characters. I definitely didn't regret the double purchase :)  <3 Natalia and her bricks. Can't wait till I get to finish the campaign and then replay it! Just need to find some gullible friends..."

But as much as I play Raid, I never listen to music while playing. Me and my gf just play and deal with the music. But one time, we were listening to this soundtrack together while playing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liRBUMvo0sI  Classic 8-bit like music. I love chiptunes!  Btw that song you posted is perfect! What genre is that? I'd love to listen to more of this any time!"
residentevil,35nhci,MattKimura,2,Tue May 12 01:04:24 2015 UTC,"Electronica I believe. That should be the genre anyways.  Definitely agree with the same-songs deal. I don't mind them too much but the repetition does get annoying. Can't remember what they call the RE6 remix they use but I absolutely LOVE that song, and the one I linked somewhat reminds me of it."
residentevil,35nhci,LexCrunch,3,Tue May 12 01:12:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that does sound like it would be electronica. I'll look more into that, I'll even have a playlist dedicated to it! I love having all my music on Google Play Music, let's me upload 50,000 songs for free, and I can download them off the site anytime I want if I ever waned to share it with someone.  The mecenaries song in RE6 is called ""Heat On Beat"". In RE Rev 2 it's called ""Heat On Beat 2015"". That's the best song in Rev 2 raid mode hands down! Every stage should just have that one song. Or at least have other techno/trance songs. Sounds even better with surround sound!"
residentevil,35nhci,LexCrunch,2,Tue May 12 07:17:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I bet! Really makes me wanna set up a 5.1 setup and try it out myself. I liked RE5's Mercenary song but the one for 6 easily takes number one spot! It's too good.  Seriously though if this type of thing is your jam then I suggest looking into more of Rom Di Prisco's work. He has another genre that he does, or used to I believe, pieces on called ""Jungle"" for the older Need for Speed games. It's different than what you heard but it is still awesome. I'll pull up a few songs of his.  EDIT: Here are a few examples.  Different guy but they collaborated together so it's fairly similar."

Additionally, remember to always switch to the shotgun as soon as the large Salvador approaches for it has the best knock back abilities in Leon's arsenal.  On a final note, it it easy to get duped into thinking that climbing to the highest platform for a vantage point is a good idea. This may be the case on other levels but the Salvador has the ability to jump up all the ladders at once which leaves you completely trapped with nowhere to run.  Good luck."

residentevil,35dzvp,MrSomeBuuuDee,7,Sat May 9 12:21:38 2015 UTC,"The daily challenges can raise you up to 5 levels in one go, if you use a character with a big rest bonus. Other than that, just keep doing missions which match whatever level your character is at - if you go below your level, you won't earn much XP, and going above means missions take longer than they need to. You get extra XP if you complete a mission for the first time. You also get extra for gaining all 5 medallions.  So, the best tactic (my best guess, anyway) is to get a weapon which can kill enemies quickly, with a Soul Eater bonus for extra XP. I use a magnum. Then, just complete a mission for each level, getting the 5 medallions. You'll tend to gain around one level per mission this way, so you can always move up to a new mission, avoiding the penalty for repeating a mission."

residentevil,35dzvp,iPickled,2,Sat May 9 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"I like doing gauntlet 5 mission 2 to level up my characters. Every enemy has the speed buff which means they are classified as elites and give bonus exp. Plus there are like 63 enemies so the experience pool is high, especially when you have a high rank soul eater equipped."
residentevil,35dzvp,chan_jkh,3,Sun May 10 09:10:05 2015 UTC,"Have a non-lvl-100 sniper rifle Muramasa and the sniper rifle mastery skill.  Equip with the Soul Eater. Whenever possible, destroy it so you can upgrade soul eater (preferably if you see another Muramasa in the shop). If you have max level parts and a level 100 gun to spare, then do as you feel like.  Add burst and/or homing ammo if you feel like. They make things easier as well. If you add homing ammo, you might want to have a secondary gun with soul eater to finish off Revenants and Slingers.  You should have sufficient ammo to take on just about any level (and for bosses, swap to other guns to weaken it then finish them with the rifle).   Grab a second controller, turn on split screen mode. Use first player with your best character. Second player on the character you want to level up. Sit the second player controller down and just go through the level with your main character. Your second player will still get all the experience (it scales down, but generally speaking they'll gain anywhere from 2-4 levels depending on the map you choose).  Choose a ""linear"" map, one with a defined start and end point and no open-ended areas. This ensures that enemies don't sneak up and kill your underlevelled player.   I like the one subway map that has only hunters and napads. Takes about 3 minutes to complete and gets you a nice amount of exp and gold."

residentevil,35d7zk,constar90,2,Sat May 9 09:08:20 2015 UTC,I was genuinely surprised how good it was on the 3ds.
residentevil,35d7zk,The_Gecko,2,Sat May 9 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much you use your DS out and about, really. The PC version has some nice upgrades in graphics, performance and content, but I think Revelations' raid mode works best as a portable time killer. If you plan on playing your DS to pass time waiting on the train or the doctor's office or road trips or whatever, then the raid mode is a fantastic time sink. It would be a real shame to make a ton of progress and find great rare weapons on the PC version only to have to do it all over again."
residentevil,35d7zk,LexCrunch,5,Sat May 9 08:24:42 2015 UTC,"PC!  I've played both and it sucks without dual twin sticks. 3D effect is overrated. AFAIK the NEW 3DS doesn't have the twin stick add-on? (only the old one). But even then, get the pc version."
residentevil,35d7zk,foxmulder2014,3,Sat May 9 04:52:23 2015 UTC,"It does have a built in 2nd analog (c-stick as they call it), though the calibration on mine is not the best."
residentevil,35d7zk,jandc86,1 point,Sat May 9 04:56:17 2015 UTC,"Just incase anyone looks here again, but I played it on PC, in basically one play through. Game was longer than I expected, I had got about 4 hours in on 3DS when it came out, expecting to be pretty far, turns out I had a lot to go.   Was pretty dang good, more challenging on normal than any other RE i can recall."
residentevil,35d7zk,HobbieK,1 point,Sun May 10 09:56:32 2015 UTC,3ds. The effect and feeling of playing it is perfect I think because it being handheld you're more connected to the game and it's moments.  It was so well done with it being a handheld and to be honest I'm really really let down with how RE2 with it being on the big systems with more power to use. 5 enemies aren't enough and if I'm missing any that just shows how great they were.

residentevil,357jpk,LexCrunch,2,Thu May 7 21:25:21 2015 UTC,It is. It feels a bit more arcade compared to the other one due to the upgrade system and the score-keeping mechanism but it is friggin' excellent.  And yeah. It's been years for me too I just randomly thought of it when I was listening to a song that reminded me of the awesome that game is.

residentevil,357jpk,AlxSTi,1 point,Fri May 8 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"DC2 was way more action-y, but had some grinding in it. I'd easily rank it far above the first game, which I wanted so badly to like because it was so cool the way it took the RE formula and put a sweet twist on it with dinosaurs and a dynamic camera, but it was just so easy to run away from everything and wasn't fun.  Besides the occasional sections where you absolutely have to kill things, I don't think I fired a single shot in my first and only play through."
residentevil,357jpk,Muugle,2,Thu May 7 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"I never understood why they didn't use Dino Crisis as the action/horror hybrid that later Resident Evil became.

residentevil,357jpk,XenobiaXD,1 point,Fri May 8 11:38:02 2015 UTC,I loved those growing up  but i doubt capcom could do it right a small or indie dev could do it. Also keep it  classic style and controls just better quality.
residentevil,357jpk,AlxSTi,1 point,Thu May 7 20:36:28 2015 UTC,I remember they remade or at least did a sequel for Turok a few years ago. It wasn't well received but I enjoyed playing it on the 360.

(If you really want a slowburning survival horror, pick REmake, if you're wanting something a little kinder to newer players while being more action-oriented, RE4)   Should I play the game in release order or is it better to play them in a different order.   I don't think that's really a good idea.   Are the games still playable? I realise that the graphics obviously won't match any current standards but it isn't the graphics I really mind. Are the controls easy to use, are the games hard to find?   Survival Horror games, espcially most RE games, are notoriously clunky and slow paced to control, but once you get used to it, you kinda learn to enjoy and even love the control schemes. I disliked tank controls and the ""no moving while aiming"" mechanic initially, but again, it'll grow on you.   3.What gaming systems would I need to play all the main games in the series?

residentevil,3567vy,theAangstykid,1 point,Thu May 7 18:43:13 2015 UTC,RE4 on 360/PC and REmake on PS4 are great places to start.
residentevil,3567vy,DrHoenybun,1 point,Thu May 7 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, I felt like the controls for RE4 was better on the PS3 rather than 360. Felt wrong to play resident evil with a gamepad, not the ps3 controller. You can play all games up to the newest just on the PS3."
residentevil,3567vy,Nicholas_,1 point,Fri May 8 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"Didn't feel wrong to me at all, and i've played it on almost every system.

residentevil,3567vy,theAangstykid,1 point,Fri May 8 21:47:28 2015 UTC,See I didn't like the gamecube controller. Couldn't play REMake more than a couple of runthroughs till the PS3.

residentevil,3567vy,Nicholas_,1 point,Fri May 8 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"If he prefers it, fine. I personally just view RE games as the kind where you sit down on the couch infront of the big screen with a controller in your hand (I know PC can achieve that with the right set-up, but i'm assuming he doesn't have that)"
residentevil,3567vy,moldycheerios,4,Fri May 8 21:54:12 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you about a 1.5-2 months ago. I bought RE5 on sale, loved it, and decided to marathon the whole series from start to finish, and just a couple days ago finally finished them all. Personally, the old school controls/camera angles are something you can, and will get used to, given you can accept a few early deaths adjusting to it.   If you're dead set on playing chronologically ( I was, for the story, which turned out to be a bit of a non-issue, as the series doesn't really capitalize on plot until about re4, and even then there aren't enough references to past entries that really enrich the experience) then I highly recommend at least starting with the remake of 1, as it does still use the old style controls, but tweaks it so that it's a little more user friendly.   From that point I played about 1/3 of RE2, and just couldn't get past the graphics/clunkiness, so watched a ""let's play"" for that, and re3. Don't get me wrong though, they both looked like they'd be a lot of fun had I stuck with them, and if graphics are a non-issue to you, I do highly suggest giving them a try. you'll notice a huge gameplay difference between 1-0 (1,2,3,code veronica x, and zero) and 4-6, mainly in the form of giving you a crosshair/laser-guided aiming. This is when the series begins to focus on action/tps. By no means does this make the games any less fun, just a different kind of fun. Early entries had a lot of back tracking, which had a big impact on the suspense/horror aspect. There's a certain feeling you get when you see half a dozen zombies outside a long hallway of windows, banging on the glass, only to see them finally smash through on your 3rd or 4th run down the hall. 4-6 still had some of those moments, but with a lot less back-tracking, making the surprises a little less suspenseful.  If you find yourself playing all of them and actually liking all of them, then the revelations series would probably be your favorite, as it does a fantastic job of blending the old with the new, and providing a well written storyline that goes with it (though some may call the second one cliche, referencing a popular movie series).  tl:dr puzzle fan? play 1-3, zero, and code veronica x  tps fan? play 4-6  mixed? play the revelations sub-series  want a decent story? Play them all, just realize you won't be satisfied until much later in the series, as the early entries rely heavily on ""hidden documents"" to enhance the plot.  edit: forgot about cvx"
residentevil,3567vy,baby_shoo-shoo,2,Thu May 7 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"Good man.  Out of curiousity, what was your favourite Resident Evil and why?  I've played most of them from launch and I swung back and forth between 2, 4, Code Veronica and now Revelations being my absolute favourite of the entire series - with 4 coming a seriously close second."
residentevil,3567vy,Nicholas_,2,Fri May 8 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"I think zero was the first game to really ""wow"" me, just because I felt they reused a lot of mechanics/ideas over and over between the early games, and playing them in quick succession just felt monotonous. The idea of actively switching to a partner to take turns solving a puzzle was fresh to me. If they remade this or even just ported it to PC and added co-op with additional content (for story gaps when you only had access to one) I would definitely make this my favorite.  Having said that, given there's not a lot of evidence this pipe dream would even come true, I'd have to say Revelations 1, simply for the great blend of story, problem solving, and fast paced action. Not that I didn't REALLY like 2, I just prefer the protagonists of the BSAA, so the story kept me a little more engaged."

residentevil,3567vy,potzdamn,1 point,Fri May 8 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"""Should I play the game in release order or is it better to play them in a different order.""  Most definitely play them in the order they're intended to be played in.  It gives a nice continuity to the storyline that you wouldn't get if you didn't.    I'd say go for Hd Remake, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, Resident Evil Code-Veronica, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Revelations, Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil Revelations, Skip 6 because in my opinion it's absolutely dreadful and isn't Resident Evil at all.  But if you must play it, then go ahead, but don't say I didn't warn you.  Optional game(s) you could play are Resident Evil 0 (A bit weak storyline, but a pretty interesting prequel to 1 and is actually a really good game if you can get used to the team mechanic unique to that game.  I would say not to bother to touch the survivor series or any games apart from the ones I mentioned because most are simply not worth playing and have nothing really to do with the main storyline anyway.  ""Are the games still playable? I realise that the graphics obviously won't match any current standards but it isn't the graphics I really mind. Are the controls easy to use, are the games hard to find?""  Hell yes the games are still playable.  Especially 4 since it got a re-release on the PC on steam - it looks and plays fantastic at 60fps.  2+3+Code Veronica are a little dated, yes, but, they have an almost unique visual style which won't deter you in my humble opinion.  ""What gaming systems would I need to play all the main games in the series?""  To be honest, the PC can play every single Resident Evil game as far as I know.  If you're wanting to play 2-3-Code Veronica, you must make sure you pick up a cheap compatible controller for those games since to my knowledge they don't support the xbox 360 controller for Windows unfortunately.  I know for a fact though that 1, 4, 5, 6 all run the best on the PC and absolutely flawlessly with a decent rig.  TL;DR -  Play Resident Evil Hd Remastered, 2, 3, Code Veronica, 4, Revelations, 5, Revelations 2,  Six if you absolutely have to but I don't recommend it.  0 is optional but it's an epic game, either pick it up for cheap online + a second hand Gamecube to play it on or just use an emulator to run it on.  PC is the masterrace for Resident Evil games."
residentevil,353o8i,crmonials,6,Wed May 6 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"Next Gen console ports of Resident Evil Outbreak, with new servers to handle multiplayer. I would lose my shit.  But on topic, yes, I am interested to see what (and when) they decide to unveil in regards to RE7. I think we all know it will be more horror, but to what extent, it is very hard to say. Not to mention, we've only heard them say that they're ""returning to their horror roots,"" with literally every single RE release since 4, so at this point I really do not expect much in that regard.  However, the sales and critical reception of REmaster, Revelations 2, (and the potential upcoming REmaster Zero) are very much a positive sign for Survival Horror fans, and while still extremely skeptical, I think Capcom just might have gotten the message this time.  Honestly, I feel things are looking better for the series than they have in a long while. Even if they end up rebooting the series, as long as it's a return to actual HORROR, I feel I will be satisfied."

I absolutely love both, I wouldn't want just one or the other. I for one thought RE5 was incredible, objectively its just a damn good game, even if its not what everyone wanted in a Resident Evil game. Six was not terrible, but it was a bit of a mess regardless.   Anyway, I've been betting some of my Resident Evil friends that RE7 will actually return to its roots. They are all extremely skeptical but after all the criticism that RE6 generated, and the moderate success of RE:Remake relaunch, I think it's a safe bet. Also keep in mind how excited people were about Evil Within, PT, and Silent Hill. With Silent Hill being a bust it seems like RE7 could easily fill that hyped up void."

residentevil,352ayz,JoeKrauzer,2,Wed May 6 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"The head shot exploding head is a one-and-done in classic RE games, while the shot to the legs with a shotgun almost always left the zombie able to crawl around making it necessary to finish it off with a few more bullets from a handgun or another blast from a shotgun. Conserve ammo and always go for the head in classic RE games when it comes to the shotgun"
residentevil,352ayz,Tattoomyvagina,1 point,Wed May 6 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe it's just my experience having never played on the hardest difficulty, but the leg shot has always been a one and done for me in ReMake.  It kind of made most multi-zombie encounters trivial.  One head shot with the shotgun, one leg shot, move on."
residentevil,352ayz,Tattoomyvagina,6,Wed May 6 15:12:21 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I started playing the RE games back when RE 2 first came out and discovered the headshot method vs the leg shot creating crawling zombies. After I learned my lesson I never again went for the legs unless absolutely necessary. When REmake came out, I never blasted out the legs from my years of experience with the originals, so I never even knew the leg shot also worked as an instant kill in REmake. Lol"

residentevil,352ayz,LexCrunch,1 point,Wed May 6 15:29:10 2015 UTC,RE2 also had the random chance of creating a crawler when you hit them in the torso.
residentevil,352ayz,chan_jkh,2,Sat May 16 02:08:10 2015 UTC,"If you shoot zombies in the leg with the shotgun or magnum in 2 or 3, what technically happens is they die, but will sometimes be replaced by another monster, being the crawling zombies with almost no health left that will grab your legs for menial damage and can potentially set you up to get completely wrecked by nearby monsters. If you exit the room while they're crawling and come back, they'll have despawned. They're not really a big deal most of the time. One handgun bullet will put them down after that if you really have to.  If you try that in the very first game, they'll crawl at you to attack, but if you leave and come back, they'll be back to normal with full health again.  This is only useful in REmake and RE2. In REmake, it's a guaranteed OHK every time. In RE2, aiming low with most weapons lets you shoot sooner than if you were aiming straight or high, which may get you out of a tight bind sometimes. That trick only works with the handgun in RE3, though."

residentevil,34ykul,theAangstykid,14,Tue May 5 17:09:23 2015 UTC,RE2 is my favorite of the series.  I loved how the 2 stories intertwined.
residentevil,34ykul,Zaeh,3,Tue May 5 17:27:25 2015 UTC,"It certainly had a way better story in both writing and format, and the cast is both larger and cooler. Still can't get over how entertaining Chief Irons was."
residentevil,34ykul,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue May 5 21:12:27 2015 UTC,"Someone else seems to have loved it as well, as multiple games after that had tried to replicate the two scenarios format in various forms, or the 'zapping' system."
residentevil,34ykul,Turtlez4lyfe,8,Wed May 6 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"I thought the dodge move in RE3 along with the ability to shake off grapples before taking damage was really dumb and entirely too easy to exploit, and the random nature of some of the events in the game also make it really irritating to speed run. It also neutered a couple of the tricks from RE2, which I wasn't happy about. The 180 turn was definitely a necessary addition, considering the increase in monster aggression and overall enemy count, but it would completely wreck the predecessors if it was incorporated retroactively.  I kind of liked the gunpowder system for its versatility; your friend's playthrough might be drastically different from your own based solely on the type of ammo you were mixing. Still, if you weren't using them all for special grenades, you were doing it wrong.  I don't dislike RE3, but it personally doesn't come anywhere close to RE2 for me. You're definitely right about RE3 being harder, and the Nemesis monster allowed it to do tension extraordinarily well; but I much prefer the consistency, content load, faster pacing, and narrative of RE2."
residentevil,34ykul,SilentBobVG,4,Tue May 5 17:50:44 2015 UTC,"Still, if you weren't using them all for special grenades, you were doing it wrong.     except first two A's since you might need more than 15 handgun ammo at start Hard is only hard early honestly, but It's all about efficiency/saving stuff for later like every RE"
residentevil,34ykul,LexCrunch,7,Tue May 5 21:59:02 2015 UTC,"Normal mode is too easy in RE3, you start off with tons of ammo, health and weapons and find loads just running about. In hard mode it's basically RE2, you start with very minimal support and it can be quite difficult if you don't know how to manage your supplies properly  RE3 is definitely the scarier of the two, but 2 just has better everything else really. Although, I do consider RE3 to be incredibly underrated by fans of the series."
residentevil,34ykul,SilentBobVG,4,Tue May 5 18:32:48 2015 UTC,I always thought 3 was the first one everybody thinks of when the series is mentioned.
residentevil,34ykul,RamBo-ZamBo,4,Tue May 5 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"Really? Everytime I bring up Resident Evil with friends they usually go straight for RE2 or RE4.

residentevil,34ykul,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Tue May 5 18:47:05 2015 UTC,"RE3 was definitely underrated by fans. I always liked it more than RE2 as well, and it is also scarier. At that time RE2 was fine, but if you play it again now it feels entirely too easy, RE3 does not. I mean come on Mr.X, you do fucking nothing compared to Nemesis. The only thing I don't like in RE3 are the random passwords and placement of Colt/Grenade Launcher. In a speedrun it's super annoying when you get the Colt early on, you can basically start over."

Now with the survival horror aspects, it is slightly less, in that it is quite action packed. But there are still some points when a bandersnatch grabs a scientist's head and smashes it into the glass in front of you where I was like ""welp, I'm fucked"""
residentevil,34ykul,MarkaliteMkII,3,Tue May 5 21:44:48 2015 UTC,I always find it hard to consider resi 3 as it own thing  it the third disc in away for resi 2
residentevil,34ykul,DatOmills,1 point,Tue May 5 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Compared to most of the games in the old-school series (pre-RE4, I mean), RE3 felt like it brought the fewest new ideas to the table. Still a great game, though."
residentevil,34ykul,The_Naked_Snake,3,Wed May 6 06:23:12 2015 UTC,"A little late to the party, but I find RE3 to be horribly underrated. Even I didn't really consider that great until recently. I fuckin love RE2, but I find 3 the better game by a good amount. In terms of mechanics 3 just does almost everything right! Sure some of them are very action oriented but everything has something to balance it out. Nemesis is by far one of the scariest enemies in series. The only thing I find scarier is the Crimson Heads. Now while nemesis is super spooky, the game as a whole isn't scary.  I have a lot to say about the game but I wont bore you much more. I honestly find it one of the best in the series, only being surpassed by REmake. To each their own though."
residentevil,34ykul,StayBoldSon,2,Wed May 6 01:16:41 2015 UTC,REmake remains my absolute favorite in the franchise too; I guess great minds think alike.
residentevil,34ykul,Azoththemerciless,1 point,Wed May 6 03:48:35 2015 UTC,I've always thought of RE3 as being more action heavy but you make some pretty solid points that I guess I never thought about.
residentevil,34ykul,ShadowLeggy,1 point,Tue May 5 17:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's fair to label it as the more action-heavy of the two. But I think what the Nemesis system brought to the survival and horror aspect helps balance it out."
residentevil,34ykul,Metapher13,2,Tue May 5 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"The Nemesis system still scares the shit out of me, I love RE2 so much and it will always remain my favourite game but it doesn't spook me hard like RE3. It's hard for me to play RE3 because nemesis terrified me as when I was a kid."
residentevil,34ykul,DrHoenybun,1 point,Tue May 5 21:01:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah another vote here for RE2. The story and characters are just much better in RE2 and that tips the balance IMO. I still love RE3, it's just too easy."
residentevil,34ykul,DrHoenybun,1 point,Wed May 6 02:50:23 2015 UTC,"Nemesis was definitely scary, but at the same time... I think a lot of people went in knowing he existed. As in, knew he would be a stalking monster and everything. Then again, knowing beforehand kinda causes dread like ""when's it gonna happen"".  In that respect, I suppose RE2 was more of jumpscares but damn they were the good kind. I had absolutely no idea that the Mr. X was even a thing, so when he first showed up I pissed myself. And when he kool-aid busts through that one wall... holy shit."
residentevil,34ykul,DrHoenybun,1 point,Wed May 6 05:12:51 2015 UTC,"I really prefer RE2. Nemesis was intense but after a while it was rather boring meeting him again and again, even though he was harder than most RE2 bosses. I never liked the dodge system of RE3 very much either. The story was so-so and while I enjoyed seeing more of Raccoon City it came off as an extension of RE2. The characters, setting, atmosphere, story, enemies and bosses interested me a lot more in RE2. That said, I still think RE3 was a good step in the RE franchise, it gave a little bit of everything (like the clock tower area was a fun area)."
residentevil,34ykul,bitterberriescomics,1 point,Wed May 6 07:44:57 2015 UTC,"See I disagree, I felt like 3 was a huge letdown from the original games. Two was more on terms of the first game, just with a lot more added and a much better cast. While 3 was like, our only scare factor is nemi."
residentevil,34ykul,sungazer69,2,Tue May 5 18:45:55 2015 UTC,"While 3 was like, our only scare factor is nemi.    The thing is, the Nemesis completely knocks anything RE2 has to offer out of the park, in terms of tension, scare factor, and difficulty. If we were to take away the Nemesis, RE2 and RE3 are similar enough that the difference is kinda not worth discussing.  Also, saying ""only scare factor is the nemi"" is like saying ""only scare factor was the main monster"" in regards to any horror movie. It's just false reductionism."
residentevil,34ykul,xwhocares3x,0,Tue May 5 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"Well no, the whole point of nemi. was to be that constant terror, and while they did do that. By the third time he was chasing you it wasn't scary, you learned to expect him on every corner, to fight him. He became more of a annoyance than a scare factor. While in two, you had the several jump scares with inside-out mans. And the constant threat that Mr. X or Berkin was out there looking for year. Hearing the distant screams and not hearing him, only being a floor away, made things more scary and intense than nemi just running around town with you ever did."
residentevil,34ykul,Ryndis,1 point,Tue May 5 23:21:38 2015 UTC,"Like, I see what you're saying, but it didn't at all fall in line with my extremely recent playthroughs of both games. It also kinda blows my mind to see you actually hold Mr.X/Birkin in higher/equal regard to the Nemesis. The Nemesis is basically Mr.X but miles better in every respect. Some things are so black and white that I just dont feel like pressing them any further.   Either you played on easy or you haven't played it recently enough to quash your biases."
residentevil,34ykul,ShadowLeggy,1 point,Wed May 6 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"It isn't biases, I played both games and fairly recent. The thing was, with nemisis, was that he got annoying like I stated earlier. Most people I talked to, said that. While you didn't have to fight Birken every other screen. Them lingering behind you afraid to go back over there, afraid to back track was more scary. While with nemi, you expected him to be there, every screen.   Not to mention you knew you where nemi. was around just by his chasing music. Which prepared you that he would be around."

After playing Chris, I have a hard time going back to Jill's wimpy health pool. Chris does get flash grenades instead of the taser, though. That's a one-hit kill weapon and it rules. Makes the boss battle with the crimson stupid easy.  As for combating your lack of inventory, it's really not a big issue, especially since you've already beaten the game before and know how to win. Just carry less stuff with you out of the save room and learn to say NO when the game asks if you want to pick up stuff if you know you won't have space for something you need before you get back to the box. I often find myself running around without a weapon so I can haul more stuff. Lack of lockpick isn't a big deal either. It's only a relevant obstacle for the first few minutes of the game, and most small keys are really close to locked doors so they won't take up space for long."

residentevil,34secg,albertswiskers,4,Mon May 4 03:53:53 2015 UTC,Is there some kind of bonus game where you can play as Wesker? Like a raid mode? I only ask cause this looks like an in game screen shot and not from a cut scene that I remember from the Gamecube version.
residentevil,34secg,Stabstone,6,Mon May 4 07:23:30 2015 UTC,It's probably a mod

residentevil,34u2xw,JamieDJ8887,2,Mon May 4 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"Don't save willy-nilly, the saves are limited and you'll want to really think about when you want to. Playing as Jill is effectively ""easy"" difficulty, as she has more inventory slots than Chris and receives WAY more backup from Barry than Chris does from Rebecca. You can entirely skip the boss fight with Yawn, the giant snake- just run in, grab the Death Mask and run back out; although if you're playing as Jill you'll want to run back in to grab Richard's shotgun."
residentevil,34u2xw,Sissle,2,Mon May 4 15:59:45 2015 UTC,"Pick anyone, jump in blind, head first, and don't carry any reservations about starting the whole game all over again for whatever reason. Asking for help before you even start takes away a lot of the fun."
residentevil,34u2xw,LexCrunch,2,Mon May 4 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"I dont think he should pick anyone. I appreciate you're trying to promote a style of play that will make his experience full of surprises, but picking Jill first really does negate alot of unneeded frustration that may contribute to new players just giving up/seeking out walkthroughs.   Picking Jill first is a must for any new player. But I generally agree with your principle as far as actual in-game hints go."

In the early game, there's not enough ammo. Avoid first, kill when needed.  *Take your time the first run through. When you find stockpiles of healing items, make a few trips to get them all into your item box. (Except blue herbs, you should really only need 1 or 2 of those max.)"
residentevil,34u2xw,CFGX,1 point,Mon May 4 17:57:52 2015 UTC,"If you're playing on easy or normal there's plenty of ammo to kill everything, tho maybe not early on.  Just have to figure out which bodies to burn and which areas to avoid later"

Create multiple saves of your file (ie save 1 in slot 1, save 2 in slot 2, then save 3 in slot 1, etc) so you can go back to earlier in your run if you find you can't get past a certain part due to some reason."

residentevil,34q13m,iPickled,5,Sun May 3 15:14:21 2015 UTC,"1) Moira adapted to t-Phobos. If she were to ""die"" then she would gain superhuman abilities. Virus hosts can't die normally because the virus keeps them alive in a coma, a state of suspended animation/apparent death. Then the virus activates, heals and resuscitates the host.  Claire is still infected with t-Phobos. However, it will never affect her as she never feels true fear. The game makes a point of this by making her bracelet never go above orange. So she is forever safe despite being infected thanks to her experiences making her mentally tough. If she survived the island without succumbing to fear, there's virtually nothing that will make her.  2) Natalia adapted to the virus and, like Moira, will gain superhuman abilities if ""killed."" That's what happens in the bad ending. Alex Wesker couldn't adapt because she was never afraid until the moment she killed herself and feared death, which then caused her to mutate. Alex's copied consciousness within Natalia can force her to trigger the virus and become superhuman if she intentionally ""kills"" herself.  I'd rather the Revelations series focus on being side-stories with the option of covering bigger plot details that are left-over from the main titles or new details that are referenced in the main games but cannot be covered entirely because those games have a larger focus. Titles such as Gun Survivor and Outbreak have always covered side-stories that add a lot to the series mythology. The Revelations series should simply be just that but under a single banner."

residentevil,34m2g1,SilentBobVG,-1,Sat May 2 16:14:41 2015 UTC,I remember getting all of the costumes at once after beating the game one time with an A rank.

Walk through/around the waterfall into the caves. Take the flamethrower, use it to get me past the hunters and big spider - this would be the toughest part.

It's weird thinking that whether the story matters in the overall series or not isn't up to the people that actually made the game."
residentevil,34gjf2,iPickled,5,Thu Apr 30 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"Going in reverse here but here's my thoughts on your costumes:   Helena sounds like a cool idea especially as a Gina skin. Voices are similar so it works here. Excella is a great idea for Alex. Also pretty similar. Sherry as Moira? Excellent. Kinda iffy here. Would look great but some voice work would be needed or else it would be kinda weird. I think Piers would work great as a Neil skin. Defs good choice (also unrelated but I think they need a monster Neil skin too). Jessica as Jill is a good idea too. I like it.   I think Ada should have been an addition from the start as well. Although I don't know how her grappling gun function would work considering there isn't a physic in the game for it as well as usable locations. Could act as a whip attack or something though! This I'd be okay with.  Also I might be the only one in this boat, but I was a pretty big fan of some of the characters in ORC so people like Vector (could be a HUNK skin) and Spectre would make great additions IMO. The voices are fairly similar so it would be very little to minimal work at best. Thoughts?"
residentevil,34gjf2,REsoleSurvivor1000,4,Fri May 1 00:18:53 2015 UTC,"I mained Four Eyes and Party Girl and I'd happily play them in Raid Mode.   As for the grappling gun, what if it pulled you to a location or pulled an enemy to you and she back flipped off them or something. It'd be pretty useful I think.  I think they could import voices from other games so I'm not too worried about that when it comes to costumes. In the entirety of Resident Evil 6, all the characters have had to say something similar to the voice commands present in Raid mode.   As for the characters, I only selected those that they could reuse from other games easily. So basically anything RE5 and past that should work. Maybe Ashley Graham could work also as another Moira skin. Her kit could consist of grenade masteries (throwing speed, sticky, and radius), evade abilities and gesticulating. Maybe a passive skill that increases experience gained from tossing bottles or a healing bottle."

I was actually disappointed with Alex's costume in the game. they should have stuck with the Matrix look, but given her a white suit, leather trenchcoat and sunglasses.  But if they only add one more character I'm hoping it will be Ada.  Adding in the RE4 merchant could be fun in raid mode (it's not meant to make sense)  If they really want to use Natalia, but without giving her too much strength for a little child they could give her psychic powers to control enemies or even have a Lottie Bodyguard."

However, the virus was unsuitable for that purpose. So he continued to steal other viruses, including the G-Virus and t-Veronica, in order to get closer to that goal of forced evolution.   Despite these efforts, every virus possessed problems. Wesker's intention was to acquire as many viruses as possible in order to create a singular one that could get rid of these problems. In order to achieve that, he needed the original virus, the Progenitor Virus, the only truly ""stable"" virus. He then used TRICELL to develop the Uroboros Virus, a variant strain of the Progenitor Virus developed using clues from the other viruses.   He stole the Plaga due to its superhuman abilities and ability to control other infected organisms. However, he was interested only in its biological weapons application, which could be used to gain funding. It was not part of his evolution plan.  Uroboros is merely a variant of Progenitor. No other viruses were used to create it, they simply looked at other viruses in order to identify problems and avoid causing them in Uroboros. No mixture took place."

residentevil,34arnx,Scottehhh,5,Thu Apr 30 11:43:18 2015 UTC,"The t-Virus stops a host from dying as soon as it's in the body. In response to major trauma, an infected host can only go into a coma, which is a state of suspended animation in a ""clinically dead"" state due to lowered vitals (vital organs become unnecessary when infected with the t-Virus). Then the virus heals and resuscitates them.  Brad survives a similar situation after being impaled through the mouth by the Nemesis-T Type. As soon as the tentacle entered his body, he was infected with a strong form of the t-Virus that was able to heal enough tissue to allow him to be resuscitated as a Zombie. In Wesker's case, the virus healed him and he came out of the coma. Depending on the strain used, the host can be resuscitated with ""strengthened"" qualities such as superhuman strength depending on how the virus affects the host's genes.  Basically, nothing infected with the t-Virus is ever actually ""revived from the dead."" They never died to begin with."

residentevil,34arnx,linktm,-2,Wed Apr 29 18:11:17 2015 UTC,It's called a lot of bad writing and Shinji Mikami not being involved in Resident Evil 5 so the creative direction was way off the original concept of Wesker being a double/triple agent.
residentevil,34arnx,News_Bot,2,Thu Apr 30 14:14:14 2015 UTC,"The writing is fine. Mikami also never had anything to do with the series story, and the only game he wrote (BIO4) is widely considered to have the worst story."
residentevil,34arnx,linktm,2,Thu Apr 30 19:15:14 2015 UTC,"The ""Wesker Project"" and a giant fight in a volcano where you punch boulders says otherwise in terms of quality writing. While RE4 wasn't winning any awards, it wasn't as hamfisted and half-assed as RE5's plot (it really did a disservice by retconning all the character motivations of Spencer and Wesker.)"
residentevil,34arnx,News_Bot,5,Thu Apr 30 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Nothing was retconned at all. Spencer and Wesker's motivations were fine. The boulder was nothing more than a continuation of ridiculous physical feats that Mikami started in BIO4. People came to expect that ""coolness.""

residentevil,34arnx,News_Bot,6,Fri May 1 12:44:07 2015 UTC,"The series has been a combination of those two tropes since day one. Ruling the world was the company's (and Spencer's) goal in BIO1, and both ruling the world and forced evolution have been used many times throughout the series for many other characters (Birkin, Alexia, Mylene, etc). Wesker wasn't dumbed down, if anything he was greatly expanded as a character. Neither character deviated from their personality or from their established motivations. Their plans have been the same since they were created in 1995.  Sure, the execution of BIO5 was bad. But on paper, the writing itself is fine."

residentevil,346cvj,ColbyPBreakdown,4,Tue Apr 28 17:35:10 2015 UTC,"I really like RE6. It's great to play it last, then look back at the series and laugh at what it became. In a good way! It's fun.  Actually scary games? Probably the scariest are REmake and RE0, for their styles. RE2, RE3 and Code Veronica are scary, I guess, but their graphics take some of the edge off, less so for CV. Revelations 1 and 2 are meant to be scary, and I guess they kind of are! 4, 5 and 6 are action games, first and foremost. They do still have scary sections, but a big focus of the combat is on being really powerful. That said, I'll always find chainsaw guys scary, and you only get them in 4-6."
residentevil,346cvj,chofortu,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:01:13 2015 UTC,"I would maybe play RE0 after the REmake. That way Rebecca and the mansion incident is still fresh in your mind. And you'll know who Birkin is going into RE2. In addition, there is a very large change in quality between REmake/ RE0 and RE2/RE3. It will be very drastic going from the reasonably good quality to old quality to new again.    Most of the games have scary moments for sure, even the older ones. Jump scares mostly but I won't spoil anything.     As for RE6 I think it is garbage. The enemies are stupid and the story is too weird for me. People on here will mostly say the same thing but they all pretty much seem to like the Mercenaries mode for RE6. Personally I didn't like that either but to be fair to it I didn't spend a lot of time playing it like I did the campaign."
residentevil,346cvj,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"6 is really good if you take the time to learn it and cast off any pretenses that it's in any way scary or atmospheric, because it isn't in the slightest. It's a wacky action shooter. The campaigns vary in appeal, but it's surprising to me how different of an experience each one offers. If you're not digging one, you can just switch to another. If for nothing else, RE6 has far and away the best bonus game. I don't think RE has ever been scary. I prefer to think of them as tense; RE does tension extremely well, and I think nearly all of them have that. The only ones that don't, I think, would be 6 and both Revelations."
residentevil,346cvj,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"Resident Evil 6 is fine, it's not amazing, but it's not horrible either. Since you're a new fan of the series, you'll probably end up enjoying it a lot more than some of the more veteran fans.   The original trilogy were all scary in their day, but because of how outdated they are I don't think they're as scary as they could be (although Nemesis will ALWAYS terrify me in RE3). I think the scariest games after REmake are probably Code Veronica and 4. Revelations 2 has some good horror elements too, but not necessarily scary."

residentevil,346cvj,LeviBellington,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:23:05 2015 UTC,"Above all else, I say REmake, RE4, and Code Veronica are absolutely the most important REs to play- it really helps you get a feel for what the series has done. Where its come from, what its done, etc.  Also, I agree that RE6 was fun. Wayyy different from what the series started on, but still great fun. Its become far more action based and a lot less survival or horror bits, but there are still parts of the game that WILL make your butthole tighten"

residentevil,344avx,kikaider007,2,Tue Apr 28 04:40:31 2015 UTC,"There was nothing wrong with them in the first place. The controls only got messed up when they were changed in the latest HD remaster for no apparent reason such that there's an independent fire button instead of being bound to the same key as the action button, which is dumb and can't be changed as far as I know. I like to play on a keyboard, so I had to add the space bar to the ZXCV scheme. It's really annoying, even when discounting the fact that you can only exit menus with ESC when you should be able to use the run button.  6 didn't do keyboard controls well, either. There are tons of unnecessary shortcut keys for basic combo actions that clutter up the controls and make it way more intimidating to play if you're going in blind."
residentevil,344avx,LexCrunch,2,Tue Apr 28 05:20:35 2015 UTC,How is remaster with a keyboard? I imagine that would be quite awkward
residentevil,344avx,SilentBobVG,2,Tue Apr 28 09:22:27 2015 UTC,"It's mostly fine if you set up the controls comfortably enough. I just copied the controls from the PC versions of 1, 2 and 3 since I'm most used to playing those. What sucks is having to bind a separate button just to fire, and having to reach over and press Escape every time you want to quit menus, which wasn't a problem before.  The default setup has really awkward controls that for some reason involve the mouse. Not sure what they were smoking when they came up with that."
residentevil,344avx,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:44:15 2015 UTC,I should have specified about using a controller not a keyboard.  I have no experience playing any RE games on pc.    I want to know how an individual user would set up the controls to make it better for them and see how many things people commonly pick and why.
residentevil,344avx,LexCrunch,2,Tue Apr 28 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"Even on a pad, the old Playstation controls were perfectly fine once they moved the inventory button from START to Circle. Never liked the Japanese controls, though.  The Gamecube controller was atrocious, though. The d-pad is microscopic and practically made of concrete, and the analog shoulder buttons made the rapid fire trick in the ports of 2 and 3 nigh impossible.  RE4's controls were fine, but they were vastly improved upon in RE5 with the Type B controls unless you were playing on a 360. Using the triggers to aim and shoot is stupid and you can't change it."
residentevil,344avx,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:40:53 2015 UTC,"I have 5 on 360, are there different control setups for 360 and ps3?"
residentevil,344avx,LexCrunch,2,Tue Apr 28 21:43:45 2015 UTC,"The shoulders are swapped for some stupid reason. On PS3, you use the digital buttons L1 and R1 to aim and shoot instead of the analog LT and RT triggers, and the analog R2 and L2 triggers for map and knife instead of the digital RB and LB buttons.  I absolutely hate aiming and firing with analog triggers since I sometimes don't press hard enough to shoot or don't release soon enough to stop, so the 360 controls are really annoying.  I also haven't figured out how to get the PC version to adopt the PS3 controls yet, so I'm unfortunately stuck with 360 controls for the time being."
residentevil,344avx,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:49:15 2015 UTC,"I like the 360 controller a little better.  Its easier to use the d pad on the 360 than ps3 since its close enough to both hands that you can use your right hand to switch weapons while still moving your character with the left stick.    Come to think of it, when I played uncharted on my brothers ps3 the gun controls were the bumpers and not the triggers.  Is that a unique thing on ps3?"
residentevil,344avx,ShadowLeggy,2,Tue Apr 28 22:30:42 2015 UTC,"Every PS3 game I've played at least gives you the option of switching to bumpers for shooting. Most if not all of them, including cross-platform ports like Call of Duty, are set to bumpers by default. Some collective somewhere at Sony must have realized that analog trigger pulls are far from suitable for gunplay.  On RE5 controls, the d-pad placement isn't actually much of a boon or burden either way since your character comes to a full and complete stop when you switch weapons anyway. The only time you might benefit from quick weapon switching is to use the quickshot trick by switching while aiming, which works perfectly fine on keyboard or either controller, assuming you're using control type A or B. You should absolutely be using type B, though."
residentevil,344avx,ShadowLeggy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:39:59 2015 UTC,You may stop when you switch weapons but by using your right hand to do it but by keeping the control stick down you will move as soon as you switch guns instead of stopping and then moving when your thumb gets back to the stick.  You don't even have to reach over to hit left on the d pad since you can hit the side of the right d pad and push it left to force the left side down and not have to reach over it.  What quick shot trick? I've never heard of it.
residentevil,344avx,ShadowLeggy,2,Tue Apr 28 22:54:20 2015 UTC,"If you switch weapons while aiming, they'll be ready to shoot a lot faster than if you had them equipped and aimed with them normally. Try equipping a pistol and swapping to a sniper rifle or rocket launcher while aiming and see how much faster you fire it."

residentevil,342566,SilentBobVG,3,Mon Apr 27 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"The remade the entire tomb of the Elder crimson head in 3D, because apparently they couldn't get the pre-rendered background to look good enough.  In addition to that, every background that had a moving 'effect' on top of it had the effects remade in 3D on top of the pre-rendered backgrounds. Those kinda backgrounds were video files in the original, which obviously wouldn't have looked good now. For example, the side garden area where you get the chemical is one of these, with the tree branches being remade, and also every background with moving water or fire."

residentevil,33zqre,Nikedawg,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:20:37 2015 UTC,If you like resident evil you'll enjoy it. I think it has a decent story and fun gameplay. Not sure how the campaign would be in coop though since the secondary character in both Barry and Claire's campaign doesn't use guns. Moira uses melee only and has a flashlight to light the way and can blind monsters with it allowing you to get free damage in. Natalia can see monsters so you can be super stealthy and she can pick up bricks around the map and bash their head  in or throw them at the monsters. If you're okay with that then it would be fun. It still has the episode structure that rev 1 has though so if that annoyed you I would skip it. I personally think it's the best resident evil since 4 though.
residentevil,33zqre,novembr,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"Worth it for the split screen Raid mode alone, imo. It's fairly cheap, too, as long as you're not concerned with all the extras. Story is pretty good, not amazing, and definitely not as batshit weird as the first Revelations (I didn't mind since I kind of like batshit weird Japanese stuff). It has more survival elements than the later RE games (e.g. less ammo to go around), and a dodge you can actually control. Also has lots of challenges per chapter which lends to replayability.

As some other commentators already mentioned it is a bit grindy, but I like grind in my games so its non-issue for me.  online multi is a lot of fun, and makes farming the last boss a lot faster, but solo is just as good, and there are some farm methods that require solo play."
residentevil,33vkqc,thespectreofcapital,7,Sun Apr 26 01:18:01 2015 UTC,Shoot it until it dies.
residentevil,33vkqc,nocchisus,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:52:51 2015 UTC,"Excellent strategy, just beat it.  I guess I was expecting something more grandiose for the final battle, I mean you just shoot a crawling thing until it dies. Hardly the most inspired final boss in a post-RE4 world.   I kept expecting some gimmick, prompt or whatever.   Although idk maybe the Good Ending path does have a better final showdown. Sadly I didn't know about that thing in episode 3 that determines your ending. I thought that I wouldn't have enough time to crawl as Moira and I didn't want to risk repeating the entire boss fight so I just mashed E as Claire and then she shot the creature, but apparently there is more than enough time for Moira to even have several flashbacks. Well I guess it's back to replaying episodes 3 and 4. The Bad Ending was just... bad."
residentevil,33vkqc,Raven_257,4,Sun Apr 26 05:24:41 2015 UTC,"You don't have to replay all of 3 and 4 to change your ending, just do Claire 3 and Barry 4."
residentevil,33vkqc,nocchisus,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:40:06 2015 UTC,I did what you did in chapter 3. I thought Moira will not be fast enough so I chose Claire.   But on my second play through I chose Moira.  The good ending is awesome
residentevil,33vkqc,SilentBobVG,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:32:09 2015 UTC,The good ending has a considerably better final showdown. I would highly highly highly recommend playing through chapter 3 and 4 again just to get the good ending.
residentevil,33vkqc,LeviBellington,2,Sun Apr 26 08:26:04 2015 UTC,I'm afraid there is nothing more to it but just shooting it. I guess the orange spot takes more damage but that's about it. Go replay Claire 3 and Barry 4 since the bad ending ist awful imho while the good ending is longer and just waaay better

residentevil,33v5sl,kikaider007,3,Sat Apr 25 22:52:29 2015 UTC,"Capcom could absolutely implement this if they were so inclined. I mean, they made four campaigns for RE6 anyway, but having an A and B scenario would allow them to reuse more assets. It's pretty much win-win."
residentevil,33v5sl,MarkaliteMkII,1 point,Sun Apr 26 09:39:45 2015 UTC,"Well, a bit closer to three and a half. Ada's was pretty short"
residentevil,33v5sl,OpieKid,2,Tue Apr 28 23:07:17 2015 UTC,"That would require too much work for the developers. What you are talking about is essentially having three campaigns in one game, one for each character in single player and one co-op campaign.  It would be too confusing, it would preclude drop-in/drop-out multiplayer and it would mess up the canon for those who care about it."
residentevil,33v5sl,thespectreofcapital,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:24:47 2015 UTC,I didn't think of it like that.  I would love to make survival horror games so that's good to know.  If you have any more good info let me know.
residentevil,33v5sl,thespectreofcapital,2,Sun Apr 26 03:36:33 2015 UTC,"Well I mean there'd obviously be a lot of reused assets so that helps things.   Dead Space had an interesting idea with something similar. They had these side missions that you could only do if you were playing coop. I think that's probably a more realistic way of achieving what you described.   Perhaps instead of the three campaigns you have one single player one with the main protagonist without an AI partner. However when you do play coop you could have both the DS style side missions and you could perhaps play out some areas differently, perhaps also reshuffle some enemies/key items in the campaign to make it a bit harder since it's two people playing.  I think this would be much more manageable and it would succeed in what you intend - one experience for single player, a different experience for coop without burdening solo players with useless AI companions."

residentevil,33tmwf,kikaider007,2,Sat Apr 25 16:56:35 2015 UTC,If you pick up the RE archives II book then you can see some of the creepier enemy designs that for one reason or another didn't make it into the game.

residentevil,33sbsj,Aldershot8800,2,Sat Apr 25 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"VIII-6 is the universal choice for coop plays (or at least from what I've seen). One person, if not both, utilizes the rocket launcher to hit Mutant Neil one shot in the chest which should bring him down to 1/4 health. Then finishing him off with the Electric Bottle debuff and a weapon with Greed/Soul Eater. Nets pretty good results. While one person gets down in the mud the other sits near the spawn room and shreds the piles of enemies that appear near them. If everyone is efficient and such it can be done in like two minutes easy.  I personally like to run VI-2 myself. If you get two able people with rockets and good gear that level turns into a cheese-fest. Fastest I've completed the level is 1 minute 35 seconds tops. A great run for loot in a coop setting.  As for single player looting there's always the option of picking the ""Defend the Objective"" levels as you have mentioned. It lets you pick what you want, but I find it somewhat wasteful in terms of money/exp. Money being easy to get that isn't a huge issue, and if you're maxed out on your character skills and/or don't care much for it then that's fine too. I personally don't utilize this method much out of personal taste.  What are your methods outside of piggybacking for EXP earning at lower than Lv. 32? I find those difficulties and levels to be a drag and mostly boring. Mostly I just help other lower level people with their levels but is there a decent method for single player use?"
residentevil,33sbsj,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Apr 25 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"What are your methods outside of piggybacking for EXP earning at lower than Lv. 32? I find those difficulties and levels to be a drag and mostly boring. Mostly I just help other lower level people with their levels but is there a decent method for single player use?   unfortunately lower than lv.32 there's not many tricks outside of what you mentioned. ""piggybacking"" or ""power leveled"" by higher level players in code red difficulty is the fastest method. As far as solo before lv.32 I just always chose a map that's at least 3-5 levels above me. So nothing special really. (if any one have a leveling method for below lv.32, I'd love for you to share!)  yeah 8-6 is def the universal farming ground. As mentioned in my OP it's good for general purpose farming, but if you want xp or loot specifically, the methods I listed is a little bit more efficient.  As far as the opening chest and restart method not being to your taste, I totally understand. It can be argued it's exploiting the RNG system of the game, and if you're a purest this might feel unsavory. If that is the case 8-6 farming would be the best method for loot farming."
residentevil,33sor3,nocchisus,3,Sat Apr 25 06:17:50 2015 UTC,"They maintained the aspect ratio of the whole screen. Presumably because if the smaller screens were full-width, it would interfere with the FOV and HUD? Maybe also for performance reasons. These are just guesses though"
residentevil,33sor3,chofortu,2,Sat Apr 25 06:31:58 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I can't remember any game in recent history that hasn't done this. If you stretch the screen to fill in the blank spots, you're either getting a wacky FOV or a disgusting stretched image."

residentevil,33sor3,thespectreofcapital,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:27:29 2015 UTC,I really like the off set split screen in Rev 2.

residentevil,33ossh,NoxiousStimuli,5,Fri Apr 24 11:58:29 2015 UTC,"I think they had some kind of licensing deal with Nintendo that stipulated that main numbered entries in the series had to be released on Gamecube.

I'm sure Capcom then had the resources and extra money and labor to create it and all they had to do was remaster the remake which isn't a whole lot of work.

The 2 game combined is probably still smaller than Resident Evil 6 if you think about the areas and stories.

Change some dialogue around so it doesn't seem so cliche.  Maybe have Sherry as a temporary companion along the lines of Ashley where you tell her to hide and have to protect her. New, updated graphics that don't reuse character models and animations.  Maybe even have a small Jill cameo where the player can see/hear her in the background, but Leon/Claire can not. Maybe add some small DLC's, where you can play through as some other survivors with different goals and stuff on the same maps. Have a Foley woman die in the beginning."
residentevil,33oj1g,iPickled,3,Fri Apr 24 06:33:36 2015 UTC,"Why on earth you would consider making Shirley a companion similar to Ashley is beyond me; Ashley is the second most annoying npc through out any video game, only beaten by Navi.  As to your DLC idea and the notion of different characters, isn't that idea of having the game split in two, Claire and leon, both with 2 different parts. Then two further unlockable characters (hunk and tofu)."

residentevil,33oj1g,chan_jkh,2,Fri Apr 24 13:21:55 2015 UTC,"Ashley was the most well designed escort mission in any video game I've played. That said, it was still an escort mission. I don't think anyone wouldn't have preferred that there wasn't one."
residentevil,33oj1g,LexCrunch,0,Fri Apr 24 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"I have to contradict you as I have nothing good to say about her.   However, taken within the context of RE4, the only reason she ""worked"" was the extremely fast paced nature of the game and the amount of ammo one could churn out. If you were to take this scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFc7wxSWrkY within a RE2 setting, it just wouldn't work. There is no where near enough ammo, controls are clunky, guns aren't quick/accurate enough and you spend 80% of your time with just a pistol - not a tmp/shotgun/sniper rifle all with modifications and upgrades.  Furthermore, there is inevitably a switch of characters, in RE4 Ashley still had a way to kill the las plagas with lanterns, but RE2 Shirley has no weapon which adds to the suspense.   In order to have a npc such as Ashley the older elements of the game need to be discarded for the newer style of gameplay seen in later RE titles. That would be counter-intuitive to REmaking RE2.  EDIT: this is quite a rant, sorry, I understand people have different opinions."

residentevil,33oj1g,News_Bot,1 point,Fri Apr 24 09:57:29 2015 UTC,"More uniqueness to the B storyline in terms of locations or objectives. Except for the end, most of the puzzles and objectives were basically repeats of the A scenario.  Fix up LeonA/ClaireB. I get that most of those events aren't canon, but at least have it make sense. Downplay the Secret Agent Ada thing. It works well when she's portrayed as a civilian because then it's actually surprising when they reveal her as an agent. Don't have her equipped with holsters and gloves. Also, give her flats again. Work out a decent explanation for how Leon and Claire got into the city to begin with."
residentevil,33oj1g,chan_jkh,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:08:45 2015 UTC,"If RE2 were remade exactly like the first remake, I would be thrilled, but still very disappointed.  I fantasize that it would follow a similar approach to the first remake, but with more fluid movement and faster combat and gameplay akin to the original Playstation game. Also, the doors would be skippable by default and zombies would go back to having magnet grabs to force your hand into battle more often instead of being able to run through or around absolutely every single one.  In that fantasy world, low quickshots and the rapid fire trick also still work exactly the same as they did in the original."
residentevil,33oj1g,LexCrunch,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:46:20 2015 UTC,"If they were to speed up the combat and make combat more forced I'd honestly say remove the loading doors and make the world open. Just have the enemies able to break through doors similar to Outbreak. They could honestly implement a handful of Outbreak's mechanics into the game.  But there would be problems where you have pointless leashes where zombies just turn around after running to a certain point, or you end up playing ring around the rosey with a train of enemies. So it's hard to say really.  I'd also be happy and disappointed as well. As much as I love REmake, I don't want them to churn out REmakes with different stories. I want to see some game play evolution."

I have a bunch of character specific skills loaded up with her skillset, such as Shield, Chris' defense, Sniper Mastery (Got help from a thread I started here on Reddit hehe) and Melee Mastery. I like to think of Moira as my offensive character, like she's who I use when I know I have to kill things, and fast.   I also have another build which is for Claire which involves Chris' Defense Skill, Magic Pixel (which prevents enemies from critically damaging you when you have low health, basically), shield, sniper mastery and Grenade Mastery.   Essentially most of the characters are the same save for the skills, so the previous posters are right. However, I'm working on a joke build right now which revolves around Gina's unique skill and thank God for Gina's new costumes."
residentevil,33m9wy,Aldershot8800,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:48:33 2015 UTC,As DirkDiggy99 mentioned who you play as only really matters at first. Because once you max out everyone and Inherit their skills you can play as whoever the fuck you want. A lot of people do claim however that HUNK is the best and I think thats because out of the box he has the most potential.

The melee moves (which are super cool) in re5 are almost non existent, 1 character can melee stunned enemy with 1 move and their supporting character can melee them only when the enemy is down. It's cool switching characters to perform string melee attacks but it gets old very fast. RE5's coop melee is super fun, hard and oh so satisfying. but it's still a great game. for  some, it's better than 5"
residentevil,33kw5t,LeviBellington,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"It's much less toned down than RE 5 (or Revelations 1, but to a lesser extent). Revelations 2 is kind of a semi-sequel to RE 5 though."

I got the everything-in-it version for 20 bucks so I guess it's worth it since the bonus chapters take around 45 minutes? It depends on how good you are I guess, I'm no speedrunner but I'm pretty decent in this kind of genre so I guess it would take the average player a bit more? I, as an avid RE fan, think it's worth the money, you'll get some hours of fun combat, interesting plot and more classic Resident Evil feeling  Imho the coop is super forgettable. You can kind of ""combo"" into a melee oportunity for the gunman that's about it."
residentevil,33kw5t,aquanutz,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:39:23 2015 UTC,"Most definitely worth it. I played in PC solo and had a great time with it. The story is fun, the extra episodes are interesting, and even the raid mode has a kind of mini plot to it. You can blast through the campaign quickly, but there are different modes, collectibles, medals, etc to go for that give it lots of replay value. Aside from very minor slowdown at parts I've never had any problems running it. But probably the biggest selling point for me was that it had Barry Burton in it :-P"

As others have noted, while REV2 isn't as over the top its similar to RE5 in the way it plays.   The campaign is admittedly short but theres medals and collectables to find in each campaign level. Theres also 2 bonus missions and then you have Countdown Mode and Invisible Enemy mode to boot. Then of course Raid Mode. Its a nice little package and even with the performance issues I had at launch I don't at all regret my purchase."

Here I don't get the luxury of looking and backing out to try again but I clear this level in a little over two minutes by myself while coming out the other side with good money and great XP. Good for leveling up as well as being quick-'n-easy."

residentevil,33dd9f,sungazer69,3,Tue Apr 21 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"100% Jill. Easier in a lot of ways, especially because you get strong weapons earlier."
residentevil,33dd9f,RamBo-ZamBo,7,Tue Apr 21 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"Go with Jill and play on an easy difficulty. Jill takes less hits than Chris, but on an easy difficulty it will get you more easily accustomed to REmake. Having two extra inventory slots will really save your ass at times. Once you've played the game enough to already know what you're gonna be doing next, then go with Chris. Good luck!"
residentevil,33dd9f,MuhGrib,10,Tue Apr 21 16:47:26 2015 UTC,"Strongly agree - the extra inventory slots will allow you to be slightly less of a perfectionist with your inventory management, which can save you a lot of repetition - particularly as a first time player.  Oh, and you get slightly goofier iconic RE dialog playing as Jill, too."
residentevil,33dd9f,ZacZero,2,Tue Apr 21 17:04:47 2015 UTC,"In the REmake, I cringe more at some of Rebecca's lines. Richard still takes the cake though, amirite? I mean he's terrible in both stories."
residentevil,33dd9f,Frisky_Pilot,3,Tue Apr 21 23:53:43 2015 UTC,"Play as Jill on Easy, and if you had fun then play as Chris on Normal afterwards. They're two halves to the same story, and they get different characters/scenes/weapons, even if you're playing the same levels. There are also a lot of ending variations between them, so there's plenty of replay value."
residentevil,33dd9f,Raven_257,3,Wed Apr 22 00:24:07 2015 UTC,Jill. She is the master of unlocking.
residentevil,33dd9f,jotaesethegeek,7,Wed Apr 22 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"well it really depends since both of them have its pros/cons on:    Jill: * Has 8 item slots * Gets a grenade launcher * Has a lock pick * Is slower and rubbish with weapons in general * Has Barry as a partner.    Chris: * Has 6 item slots * Has a lighter on hand * Much better with weapons and can take more hits * Has Rebecca as a partner    I took some of Chris's since it could be spoiler for you, but there you have it you will see pretty much the same amount of stuff with either character, but quicker with jill because of the lockpick while chris will have to get the key to enter locked doors"

Rebecca on the other hand restores your health to full a limited number of times on two separate occasions.  Overall though, I say play as Jill solely for the extra inventory slots. A first timer's run on REmake, inventory room is going to be a challenge in addition to the lack of bullets."

residentevil,33dd9f,DrHoenybun,2,Tue Apr 21 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"Just finished it myself for the first time.  I say go with Jill hands down, not even because of the difficulty, but because the inventory system is a pain in the ass.  Especially when you don't know your way around and what key items to keep for where, Chris is just going to make for a much more tedious experience and force you to backtrack pointlessly to your stash a lot."
residentevil,33dd9f,Shantotto5,2,Tue Apr 21 21:45:19 2015 UTC,"Try them both for a little while and see who clicks better with you. They both have their ups and downs during specific events in the game, too. I can guarantee it won't take long to reach a conclusion.  I like Chris because even after playing through it so many times, Jill's fragility frustrates the hell out of me."

residentevil,338rs8,LexCrunch,4,Mon Apr 20 17:55:27 2015 UTC,"There is a scene from the Predule/Leon's campaign, where actual Ada pilots a chopper and fires upon Leon and Helena (in the Prelude), Leon does raise his gun against the chopper, but Ada never opens the door or anything, and you don't even see it's her in the Prelude. This is during nighttime with all the flames around.  There's another scene in Chris's campaign, where Carla stands on the deck of the Neo-Umbrella carrier, and a Family chopper appears behind her, with the side door open and a sniper inside the cabin. That sniper then shoots Carla.  An exact scene like you described doesn't exist in the game or any trailers, and I think you're just remembering the scene wrong and/or mixing up the two aforementioned scenes in your mind."

residentevil,336t87,David_Arcade,3,Mon Apr 20 02:05:47 2015 UTC,"While I find the static fixed angles to be fine, I think Code Veronica's camera was really good.  You still had the classic fixed angles, but the camera would follow you to keep you in the center of the screen."

residentevil,336t87,saxon49,2,Mon Apr 20 20:33:04 2015 UTC,I thought it was a little bit better executed in the Silent Hill series (specifically 2 and 3). But every old game mechanic seems clumsy in hindsight... hence the satire.

residentevil,336ti7,DrHoenybun,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:43:31 2015 UTC,Since you finished the remake your good on the story and shit. For gameplay wise I would play resident evil 2 first. The game has great gameplay goos story and is the longest game in the series having FOUR (4) scenarios with each scenario being similar but different at the same time.  Resident evil 3 is pretty tough to beat on your first play through.  Think of the mechanics of remaster but faster. There is a dodge and ammo making system as well as multiple choices with different variety with each choice.  To be fair re3 is my favorite game in the series but re2 has alot more content. Hope it helps
residentevil,336ti7,ripperc100jr,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"2 then 3, personally. CV would be after, going for story wise. To make things cannon, play 3 until the date changes till October. (Don't want to spoil), then play 2. After you beat 2, go back to 3 and finish. Since that is the ""cannon"" story. Also, Claire A / Leon B is better / Cannon."

residentevil,3351wq,bensawn,2,Sun Apr 19 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"ohhhhh boy ok there are competing ideologies here and both have intense fans.  theres the original three.   pros: genuinely scary- tense gameplay because of limited resources.  cons: tank controls are the fucking devil. have fun kind of aiming where you meant to   then there is 4: widely considered to be one of the best survival horror games ever made EXCEPT its primary critics are old school RE fans. what it did was change the control scheme to a much more manageable (but still quirky) over the shoulder view and change the antagonists from zombies to infected religious zealots.  pros: drastically better controls yet still retain the same claustrophobic feel. scary as fuck atmosphere, leon is a badass after his initial debut in 2.  cons: its different from the first 3. the chief complaint is that they provide too much ammo, but i never felt like i had too much of an advantage over my enemies.  5 really wasnt that bad, but it went down the same road as 4 in that you were in a different locale and you werent fighting ""zombies"" exactly. its chief issue was that it introduced a sort of coop mode that made the game much less scary. also the setting was in sunny africa so there wasnt as much of the creepy atmoshpere. overall it is a very good game, and very slick and polished- but it just isnt as scary as the original games and for a lot of fans that is the biggest problem.  i didnt properly play 6 but the general consensus is that it was wayyyyy too removed from the tactical survival horror roots and was much more of a basic action title- BUT clunky controls made it a pretty bad action game. also the story was ludicrous.  personally- my favorite is 4. i think they hit the right balance of scary and fun to play. the first three are fun for the sake of nostalgia but the controls havent aged well. the 5th game is good, but isnt particularly scary so you wont really get the proper RE experience. 6 is a mess. i say try the first three, see how you like them.

You can just start with 4 and watch Wesker's Report to get you all caught up.  Someone in here suggested you start with the remake, which I think is a terrible idea. The games get progressively harder as they come out, and the remake is hard enough that you might just get frustrated and give up.

residentevil,3351wq,EQUASHNZRKUL,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:05:46 2015 UTC,"The chronology of the games doesn't start getting dicey until the nexgen systems. So if you go with the older games, release order is fine.  Part of RE4's appeal is that it builds on an already fan-favorite character (Leon). How he got to that point is pretty important IMO, and his origin is RE2.   One major point that I think makes the older games a good start is that, if nothing else, a lot of the humor in the newer games is based on the camp of the old ones.   Start with the first one (Director's Cut). Then 2. Then 3. Remember that 2 is actually sandwiched between the events of 3.   Next up is Code: Veronica. Then 4, and so on.   There are some side games that you may enjoy, depending on what, if anything, about the series really resonates with you. The Gun Survivor franchise was a popular offshoot, as well as the Outbreak files. If you decide to go that far, be prepared to do some searching; I had to buy a PS2 slim to be able to play Outbreak."

I don't really see this 'shame' problem you're trying to make out of it.  Remake is not significantly harder than most of the others even on Normal. I'd say that Code Veronica, for example, is much harder on most peoples' first playthrough."
residentevil,3351wq,Zaeh,2,Tue Apr 21 06:00:18 2015 UTC,"CV is definitely also one of the harder ones.  The easier difficulties are a personal peeve of mine, though, particularly in 2 and 3 in which you're given at the very start way more ammo, nearly all of the guns, infinite saves, or even an infinite bonus weapon to practically cheat your way through and give the player a very wrong first impression. At least, that's my experience. First time I played 3 it was on Easy; I had all of the weapons and infinite saves and thought the game was completely stupid before I came back later and found out that Hard was actually Normal."

I think if you've only ever played 6 and Revelations, it's difficult to make an informed decision! The whole series had a significant tonal shift around Resident Evil 4 onwards, and the Revelations series is what I see as an attempt to satisfy fans of the older games. If you enjoy it over 6, perhaps you should try some of the older games, like the recently released remaster of the original game."

The whole game can single handedly be done solo if you can't find a friend but finding the collectibles and getting enough BP to raise your skill levels was a good and in the end a fun challenge. Also when you are done with that, you also have one of the highlights of the game ""Raid Mode"" such a whole new take on the mercenary mode. Its overall brilliant. Anyway, if you don't feel like playing the game and wanna watch an LP. I recommend Two Best Friends Play for theor commentary is entertaining and the fact they are major RE nerds like us"

They're a weird beast - the overall storyline is all but unrecognisable from a distance, but there are so many little touches which are for the fans of the games. Like in the Nemesis one, where they have an almost shot-for-shot remake of the intro to Code Veronica. It's not winning any Best Screenplay Oscars, no, but it's good fun if you don't make an effort to dislike it!  Also, it's been years since I watched it, but I'm pretty sure the DVD commentary for the second film was really funny. The whole cast seems like they're having so much fun, which makes all the films more enjoyable. With Milla in particular, it's fun to see how she really is, considering how insanely serious her character is all the time.  Plus, the series of Knox dubs of the first film is still one of my favourite things ever. Not sure if it's actually funny, or if I just residually enjoy it because I was a teenager when I first watched it, but whatever, I'll take it"

residentevil,331mxo,Miniduffa,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:53:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I disagree. Its a terrible franchise thats lowered the standards for entertainment for the last 13 years. These are all essentially direct to dvd films with larger budgets, which if you into thats fine. I'm not, I want more and I want better.  The biggest problem with the films, is that they aren't Resident Evil. They have some of the monsters and characters who share the same names of their video game counterparts, but are empty caricatures of them.  If you removed the Licker from the first movie, changed Raccoon city to like Chicago, Umbrella corporation to ""Evil.co""(cant think of anything clever for an example here, sorry) and the T-Virus to 'Lazarus', you have a movie thats its own thing entirely(Outside of being a bastardization of James Camerons 'Aliens').   Now I know why the direction of the film was made this way, the studio wanted a ""war movie"" instead of what the games were about. But being that the whole series is essentially a vanity project for Milla Jovovich to pout at the camera while doing generic action scenes and sequences that are copied and pasted from better films while hiding behind the brand name of a famous game franchise and still making good bank, its just depressing as hell to watch this joke continue.  I can't convince people to not see any of these films if they want too, and thats fine I like watching bad movies myself(love mystery science theater 3000) but when I think of a Resident Evil movie series I think it could be something really special and that it deserves better than whats been done with it."

That scene, where Barry is rushing alongside Claire's gurney was a memory. It happened after Claire had escaped, but before he started searching for the island. Until they found her, the only thing anyone knew is that some terrorists had crashed the party they were at.  The ER scene happens shortly after Claire escapes from the island. It takes Barry a long time to track down its location; Claire certainly wouldn't have known. The closest approximation should could have offered is ""off the coast of Russia"", and she didn't even know that for certain. You seem to be assuming that Barry is the one who found Claire in the sea. More likely she washed up on the coast of the mainland. It's not even established that she actually said ""Moira's dead.""   In the good ending, Moira shows up after 6 months of surviving on her own."
residentevil,331x7x,LexCrunch,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:05:44 2015 UTC,Yes I was thinking it was Barry who found her because I was thinking it happened right after she jumped. Thank you for clarifying that I forgot about the time difference and all that near the last chapters.
residentevil,331x7x,News_Bot,-2,Sat Apr 18 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"Remember near the beginning of Barry's episode 4 when he says ""half a year of chasing scraps."" He's been trying to find Moira since he met with Claire in the hospital. Like /u/CleverSexualInnuendo said, that scene was a flashback to fill the time gap after Barry got knocked out by Alex.  The big plot hole for me is the question of how Claire survived the leap from the tower, who found her, when, and how? Maybe the giant exploding fireworks show attracted someone to the scene, but something that high-profile would most likely have also attracted the attention of political powers to investigate and/or quarantine the place or something. While I'm at it, did Alex or someone seriously hire scary special forces in gas masks to kidnap people in public with guns blazing, and no one at all could figure out where they were taking their hostages and mount a rescue? You'd think someone might have since Claire was rescued by an unknown entity, but if she was, then why didn't her rescuer get to tell Barry right away where she was found?  I know the DLC also hand-waved Moira as being saved by Evgeny, but even that part is pretty sketchy to me since he would have no reason to be up in the tower in the first place, nor would he have any way of getting her back to his hidey-hole with the tower collapsing in a show of explosions even before then, and the thought of him uncovering all that rubble on top of her by himself with all of that going on is difficult to imagine.  Whatever, though. I stopped caring about the story making any sense around the time Barry destroyed my suspension of disbelief by using a handgun to break a crumbling ceiling in the exact way that he needed to escape some monsters. This game could very well have the sloppiest story in the series."

Best RE game ever made with so much replay ability.  Character creation as a class based system where your character has minor bonuses based on the character. The former cop does more damage with guns, the taxi driver is the only one with a minimap, bouncer does more damage with melee weapons, student with a backpack can carry more, hoodlum can lock pick, actor can play dead, etc. make it necessary to cooperate to get the benefits of each character and protect each other.  Create game modes like escape where teamwork is key like L4D, survival where you venture out collecting supplies to beef up and defend a building, and survivors where you have to find scared NPCs and lead them to a safe house.   They could separate by difficulty by adding in modifiers of the date the game takes place. Easiest difficulty would be day 1 of the outbreak with lots of confusion and chaos and NPCs running around while the most difficult would be a few days after when everything is quiet and eerie and all you find is monsters. That way the guys who like to run and gun can in their scenarios and those who want a more traditional RE can play in the more slowly explore and conserve resources in the later days."

residentevil,32x5it,I-Downvoted_You,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:38:05 2015 UTC,I don't know.  It's just my favorite of the series and Leon is a badass
residentevil,32x5it,jataba115,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:44:13 2015 UTC,"Sweet, I totally agree. I just never imagined a sequel haha"
residentevil,32x5it,ShadowLeggy,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"It already exists, it's called The Evil Within. Just pretend the dude is Leon and you're set."
residentevil,32x5it,stealthcl0wn,2,Sat Apr 18 11:03:00 2015 UTC,"RE 6 gameplay, RE 2 story."
residentevil,32x5it,the_user_name,2,Fri Apr 17 14:37:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I adore RE6's gameplay."
residentevil,32x5it,TokyoAi,0,Fri Apr 17 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"I, respectfully, say fuck that. RE6 was an above-average quality game on its own. As an RE game, it was awful.  Let's be real: RE5 was the best selling RE game. REmaster was the best selling digital title for Capcom. They might keep the controls simpler (like they did with REV2), and less advanced to make defending oneself harder (like REV2), which could lead to more  scares (like REV2) compared to the later games.  So I bet something with some elements from RE5 and REmaster will be used for the next RE title, and they used REV2 to test the  waters.  So I honestly can't confidently predict what's to come. Probably co-op in some small way or another (campaign, side-campaign, or mercenaries) and more puzzles. There could be a small chance of pre-rendered backgrounds, but I highly doubt it."
residentevil,32x5it,The_Naked_Snake,3,Fri Apr 17 20:09:37 2015 UTC,Well RE5 did also have some amazing gameplay
residentevil,32x5it,ZacZero,2,Fri Apr 17 20:36:12 2015 UTC,I loved the revelations series but I kinda disliked the engine the character movements seem a bit off like way too stif compared to RE6 the character movements and actions seemed more natural thats what I liked about RE6 it was a nice change.
residentevil,32x5it,TokyoAi,2,Sun Apr 19 01:30:14 2015 UTC,I think they should stop creating a million forgettable side characters and use some of the ones they've already created. That is how you make characters last. I think isolated settings work better than overblown world wide biohazards. I'm really not sure how they can come back from the nightmare that was RE6. And I think they don't know either. That is why they've been reluctant to go there.    I would most like to see a remaster of RE2 though.
residentevil,32wj8u,radioclash39,2,Fri Apr 17 08:27:48 2015 UTC,"Well personally, I never unlocked the sword,  but being around level 35 wish, I use a handgun, sniper, and magnum. Skills for sniper rifles, health, and shield. With ice and explosive bottles. I like using the hunter ish sniper not the SVD, because with it you can shoot through two or three people. Most of the time its one shot one kill with it. Added homing to make it even better"
residentevil,32wj8u,DrHoenybun,2,Fri Apr 17 10:44:30 2015 UTC,Bro your setup is gd and most of players are the same. Keep it up
residentevil,32wj8u,Az366,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:19:42 2015 UTC,"I think fire damage scales in a weird way - I did the first challenge at like level 3 or something, since fire still causes like 20 damage per second even when regular bullets go down to causing 1 damage per shot. I could've probably done it on lvl 1 if I'd used a bunch of life crystals to replenish my ammo"
residentevil,32t507,Blazing_Speeed,17,Thu Apr 16 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"You and I are among a small minority of people who actually liked 6, it seems.  I looove the gameplay, but frankly I pretty much hated the story.  I played the shit out of mercenaries cus it's just such a perfect combat system, but none of the characters really did anything for me."
residentevil,32t507,Danielzore,10,Thu Apr 16 15:02:22 2015 UTC,Another fan of it chiming in. I actually kinda liked the story. It Def could have been better but it was interesting. Game play was great and with three different campaigns it really gave you some variation to everything.
residentevil,32t507,REsoleSurvivor1000,6,Thu Apr 16 15:16:14 2015 UTC,Can I join this club? I liked the game but it definitely could have used some tweaks.
residentevil,32t507,call_me_canvas,5,Thu Apr 16 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yay, RE6 fans unite!"
residentevil,32t507,Blazing_Speeed,2,Fri Apr 17 01:34:15 2015 UTC,"I loved it too!  the gameplay is good. inventory is bad. the story is great but some people don't get it (I don't know why). The lack of notes to complete the story sucks. chris's campaign is the best if you managed to get thru the first part, the first part stinks. but I still love it."
residentevil,32t507,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:55:22 2015 UTC,The story is hella dumb.  It's like a die hard movie written by an over-caffeinated 12 year old.
residentevil,32t507,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:23:50 2015 UTC,Was there anything in particular you might like to have seen from the characters?
residentevil,32t507,Tooty119,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:56:16 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the gameplay as well. The story could have been better but I didNt mind it.
residentevil,32t507,bnestman,4,Thu Apr 16 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping we get another game where Leon and another famous protagonist have to team up and there will be a part where he will have to drive, pilot, or operate a vehicle. Other person fears for their life. And Leon ends up NOT crashing. Would make for good humor.  It's practically a running gag at this point with Leon and his mobile handicap."
residentevil,32t507,Shantotto5,4,Thu Apr 16 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"When I first saw that scene, I was excited (""Cop car! And Leon even reminds her to buckle up!""). But I knew what was coming :( I was just waiting for it. And then it happened."
residentevil,32t507,fishmcconnell,2,Thu Apr 16 19:00:18 2015 UTC,The only thing he somehow manages to pilot correctly is the damn jet ski from RE4. Everything else is a damn curse.
residentevil,32t507,PatriotTwo,3,Thu Apr 16 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"I'm also a fan of 6, the sheer amount of content alone I thought was fantastic. It was a blast to play through with a friend!"
residentevil,32t507,forrestlump,2,Thu Apr 16 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"It was really ambitious. I didn't hate it, I loved Leon's campaign. The intersecting boss fight sections were very well done. I dunno, I just kinda wish the whole game was more Leon style gameplay. Since RE6 came out, I feel like the Revelations series are really solid at capturing oldschool RE and modern controls."
residentevil,32t507,punikun,2,Thu Apr 16 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"Convince me to finish this game, please.  I played through ~3 hours of the first campaign and gave up because I was finding it so obnoxious.  And I loved RE1/4/5 (haven't had a chance to play the others).  Really wanted to like this but I couldn't.  I kept running out of ammo in lengthy fights that required me to kill large numbers of enemies.  I get survival horror, that was RE1 and it did it to perfection, but limiting your resources didn't mean ""oh here's a huge hoard of zombies you have to kill with this tiny bit of ammo.""  Maybe I was just playing like shit but really this felt like awful design to me.  After a couple especially frustrating encounters I just gave up on the game.  Was mostly trying to play coop online too and everyone I got would just quit after dying due to frustration as well.  Idk.  If I thought RE4/RE5 didn't feel like classic RE then I don't know what this was.  Felt like some odd sorta zombie shooter that tried to half ass some survival horror elements with no concept of how they work."
residentevil,32t507,Ryndis,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:45:43 2015 UTC,"I just picked up RE6, and it seems to me that melee is your bread and butter for saving ammo. Zombies in this game seem to no-sell pistol head shots, so during my Leon run I usually shoot just to stagger, then finish them off with the melee DDT."
residentevil,32t507,forrestlump,2,Sun Apr 19 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved the story. MY favorite has to be the Leon/Helena story, but a close second goes to the Chris/Piers story. I really liked that they had you working alongside the BSAA for a good majority. And I really felt for Chris when he loses his men in both parts of his story. There were some scenes, such as in the prelude where the soldier was following behind Leon and Helena and got caught in the door frame and told the pair to continue without him before being devoured. That part really stuck with me and it made me really appreciate the BSAA. I'm a big fan of the military so I liked seeing a bigger military response to a threat that Umbrella could produce. I could go on, but all in all I really loved the stories, how they intertwined and how they were all diverse."
residentevil,32t507,punikun,4,Mon Apr 20 04:04:10 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this. It definitely wasn't anywhere as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. And each campaign had it's own style to it, my favorite being Leon's as well. The co-op was really fun, especially with the Mercenaries. It didn't deserve all the backlash it received when it first came out."
residentevil,32t507,Ryndis,-4,Wed Apr 22 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"To some people it definitly was as bad as it was made out to be, it's totally beyond me how people can enjoy RE6 and say it's a good or even great game."
residentevil,32t507,Ryndis,3,Thu Apr 16 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"Because people have different tastes. Some people aren't blinded by nostalgia. Some people don't actually enjoy the original RE'S. Some people look at it objectively instead of comparing it to their favorite original recipe RE game. There are plenty of reasons why.  Too many people on this forum think that not being a ""Traditional Resident Evil game"" is synonymous with being a ""bad game""."
residentevil,32t507,Ryndis,2,Thu Apr 16 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I prefer the traditional Resident Evil games for sure, but that doesn't mean the newer ones aren't any good."
residentevil,32t507,chofortu,-1,Fri Apr 17 00:41:58 2015 UTC,"Oh I do enjoy newer Resident Evil titles - although to a lesser extent. It's just that RE 6 is a step back from everything the serie established while the newly introduced mechanics were just obnoxious. If it panders to your tastes - fine with me, but you're the exception.  I fucking loathe it, and I definitly DO think it deserved every bit of negative criticism it ever received."
residentevil,32t507,chofortu,2,Fri Apr 17 01:18:39 2015 UTC,Did you stumble in here accidentally? He's not the only exception to this imaginary rule of yours. Lots of people liked it.
residentevil,32t507,chofortu,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'd actually like to see your 15 reasons, especially considering how one of the games common praises is its game play."
residentevil,32t507,LexCrunch,2,Fri Apr 17 14:34:33 2015 UTC,"So a lot of those can be compiled into the ""Not an RE game"" complaint. Keep in mind that I actually agree with a lot of these points into why I dont LIKE the game, I however disagree they make the game ""bad"" on a technical level.  ""It's not an RE game""  Meleeing monsters,  RPG elements,  Monsters with guns,  No resemblance to RE,  Just a few for example, none of those constitute a 'bad' game. Linearity, another complaint that doesn't constitute a 'bad' game. These are traits that you dont like, they aren't intrinsically bad traits. A lot of side scroll classics; Castlevania, Megaman, Ninja Gaiden, Sonic, Mario are all linear. Sure, linearity doesn't fit into a survival horror game. Exploration is a key ingredient in that genre. This game hasn't been called Survival Horror since 4/5 though. I remember reading an article that its considered ""Action Horror"" now.  I personally thought the game had the best controls out of every RE game. I never felt like I died because my character didnt do what I wanted them to do. I never felt limited by my control scheme. My character acted the exact way I wanted them to act when I wanted them to. Which can't be said about tank controls. Mind you, I'm not saying tank controls are bad. The limitation was meant to emulate the situation for immersion. If a zombie was walking towards me in real life, I physically wouldnt respond the way I wanted to either. Tank controls mirror that. This is a bad control scheme, but it makes a good game mechanic because it fits the game.  Overabundance of QTE's and tripping are things that make the game bad and I'd agree with them. QTE's interrupt gameplay in a non meaningful way. They also basically force the game to have an auto save feature which limits its difficulty. Tripping is silly for the same reason it was silly in brawl, it just feels like they added realism for the sake of realism. Not for an actual meaningful reason.   Repetitive bosses are rarely fun. I didn't like fighting a Helicopter once, let alone twice. I'd like to point out though that both Mr. X, Birkin, and Nemesis are all repeated bosses with different forms. So why is it bad in RE6 but not other games? I think the problem is less that they are repetitive and more that Simmons just wasn't an interesting character and his mutations felt arbitrary and random."
residentevil,32t507,LexCrunch,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:18:50 2015 UTC,"You see, your comment about RE5 I can get behind. I always thought that the direction they should go with the more combat oriented game was what RE5's first level, and RE4's first level were. They were exploration during combat. You scavenged WHILE fighting. You didn't have the tension of exploring the unknown. Instead you had the tension of being overwhelmed. Which is a much more fitting atmosphere for an action game with veteran characters/players. I always thought RE4/5/6 shouldve basically been a storied Mercenaries mode since that game play would cater to the style much better.   Controls will always be subjective to some degree."
residentevil,32t507,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:36:18 2015 UTC,What did you dislike about RE6 specifically?
residentevil,32t507,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:53:10 2015 UTC,"The new slippery controls are cool and fun (rolling on the floor), the story is hilarious, the new characters are mostly shit but all the playable ones are cool I thought, and then almost everything else you've said could be levelled at RE5 too. You gotta try to compartmentalise the series into pre- and post- RE4 eras. You'll enjoy yourself more if you do that, and try not to compare one era against another!"
residentevil,32t507,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"Oh well. I can understand you disliking RE6, but it strikes me as anything but boring, if to a fault!"
residentevil,32t507,LexCrunch,3,Mon Apr 20 00:26:19 2015 UTC,"It's actually my second favorite in the series, but I really didn't like Leon's campaign."
residentevil,32t507,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Mon Apr 20 00:42:08 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Leon's campaign the most, seeing as how you dealt with actual Zombies and not mutated  people with guns"
residentevil,32t507,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Fri Apr 17 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"The zombies are so boring to fight, though. They're barely any threat. Even in Mercenaries, with few exceptions, the zombie levels are much less exciting than the J'avo ones."
residentevil,32t507,edwinfrco,3,Sun Apr 19 21:23:50 2015 UTC,"Only if they had mutated alternate versions of those zombies then they'd actually be something. But they're a staple to the series so they ""kinda"" have to have a nod/mention.  Thus that brings me to my next point: It's this reason that it doesn't surprise me that Capcom took the turn it did with the series and the genre-shift. Zombies just aren't that scary anymore, or at least they aren't to me. Things different like Regenerators though... Fuck those things. Nightmare fuel for days."
residentevil,32t507,aidanphantom,5,Sun Apr 19 21:32:35 2015 UTC,Regenerators... I just replayed 4 a short time ago.  Fuck the regenerators. And the Iron Maidens.
residentevil,32t507,LexCrunch,3,Sun Apr 19 21:49:33 2015 UTC,Also Garradors. The scary ass shit that game had was just too cool for its time.
residentevil,32t507,REsoleSurvivor1000,4,Sun Apr 19 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"Even the monks' chanting and laughing was just creepy.   And IT. Holy fuck, IT."
residentevil,32t507,Ryokyon,3,Thu Apr 16 15:42:28 2015 UTC,They're a lot less spooky when they're limbless and flopping around like a drowning fish at the mercy of your knife.
residentevil,32t507,PatriotTwo,4,Thu Apr 16 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"That's what I always think... and then they hop up and sink those fucking needle teeth into my shoulder! With the red eyes, and the snarl...  ...I have to go turn more lights on, now."
residentevil,32t507,SilentBobVG,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:32:14 2015 UTC,Was there anything specific you didn't like about it? I really felt it was the most genuinely atmospheric among them.  With the possible exception of Ada.
residentevil,32t507,LexCrunch,0,Thu Apr 16 18:58:30 2015 UTC,"I really didn't care for atmosphere in an action shooter, especially if that means a fifteen-minute slow-walking segment where nothing happens. The zombies are total wimps, there are a ton of slow sections, and none of Derek's mutations were a fun boss to fight. The end section with the lightning rod was pretty awesome, though.  That said, it's still lightyears more tolerable than Ada's campaign with its crummy puzzles, shoehorned co-op, and unbearable final level."
residentevil,32t507,PatriotTwo,0,Thu Apr 16 19:34:21 2015 UTC,"It was probably the quick-time events that were a downer for me. It's more like a theatrical film than a shooter in some of those segments.  And what the fuck Capcom!? Definitely all that shoehorned co-op for Ada's side story. I'd have preferred it being a single player only deal instead of ""Oh here's this dude without a name randomly here teleporting like some kind of HUNK-Jesus""."
residentevil,32t507,IceBunz,2,Thu Apr 16 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"That's the way it was originally. But when they released the update that made Ada's campaign available by default (as opposed to unlockable by completing the other three), they added ""Agent""."
residentevil,32t507,SilentBobVG,2,Thu Apr 16 23:55:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think they should have left it that way. I appreciate him in Mercs though, but he has no room in that coop campaign setting."
residentevil,32t507,IceBunz,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:57:20 2015 UTC,WAIT THE ADA'S CAMPAIGN ISN'T SOLO ANYMORE!? EVEN IF PLAYING ALONE?
residentevil,32t507,NXMT,2,Thu Apr 16 23:53:29 2015 UTC,It's still solo if you play alone.
residentevil,32t507,baconmosh,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:44:49 2015 UTC,Nope.
residentevil,32t507,chofortu,2,Thu Apr 16 18:37:07 2015 UTC,I'm genuinely confused when anyone accuses RE6 of abusing QTEs. I'm absolutely certain RE4 had at least three times as many.
residentevil,32t507,hercoldhands,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:56:21 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is yeah RE4 has them (however I don't think it has more per se), but there's a few segments in RE6 that kinda go over the top (like the Simmons train section I found obnoxious). Not saying the general idea is a bad thing, but it's the balance that matters."
residentevil,32t507,hercoldhands,2,Thu Apr 16 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"I'm joining the ""No Hate for RE6"" boat!  I loved the game myself first time I played it. I look back now and laugh all the time at poor Leon, thinking Ada's a monster (thanks Carla)  And Piers is not just Piers. Piers was my favorite, saying I don't like Chris too. Never forget. sob"
residentevil,32t507,REsoleSurvivor1000,4,Thu Apr 16 20:01:58 2015 UTC,"I concede! Piers was a pretty great character. I liked how he busted in basically told Chris to grow the fuck up. I've been replaying the Chris/Piers campaign, since I'm seeing it get plenty of love from this thread. Piers really is a pretty solid character."
residentevil,32t507,MarkaliteMkII,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved Piers. I loved his weaponry, and I loved who he was, basically just opening up Chris' eyes and forcing him to see reality. The Bar scene was incredible."

residentevil,32vh23,hercoldhands,3,Fri Apr 17 05:47:08 2015 UTC,I second Rebecca.
residentevil,32vh23,Elda-Taluta,2,Fri Apr 17 01:59:36 2015 UTC,"Ark and company, Rebecca, Helena, Sheva or Jake in no particular order."

residentevil,32vh23,hercoldhands,3,Fri Apr 17 05:45:08 2015 UTC,Survivor is totally unappreciated in the world of horrible voice acting.
residentevil,32vh23,LexCrunch,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:34:52 2015 UTC,"... for some reason (thanks to Shadowleggy's videos, I think?) I thought Ark was silent the whole game. I ... own a copy of Survivor but I've never actually played it. Color me embarassed."

It's got a bunch of mutated dogs in it with eyes in their butts  Possible plot points are Rebecca being concerned about the fact that she's entered menopause, and HUNK tracing his family history all the way back to Prince HUNK of the Eastern Slav Republic, in the 17th century: he discovers he's a distant cousin of Svetlana Belikova!"

We have no idea what happened to Rebecca after RE:0 (minus the Report you find on her desk regarding Billy).  I'd like to see the game more centered around events directly after 1998 and what Rebecca did.
residentevil,32vh23,wrathborne,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:48:59 2015 UTC,Jake is definitely be the main of re7 but I don't want re7 right now. I want Rebecca and/or Sheva as a main character of the next RER.
residentevil,32vh23,SilentBobVG,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:04:38 2015 UTC,Maybe Rebecca and Carlos
residentevil,32vh23,apollonius2x,0,Fri Apr 17 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"Its time for new characters who have little or no attachment to the originals.  Damn near every time they give us a returning character they just make them boring(Claire in rev2 was boring. Barry had life to him though).  Sherry, Ada, Chris, Jill, Leon, even Claire have all paid their dues and need to be retired. Unless they get a hell of a good writer to bring them back I think its time Capcom moved on from the classics."
residentevil,32vh23,SilentBobVG,5,Fri Apr 17 05:30:07 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point of what the ""revelation"" games are supposed to be.  They're a stage to bring back old fan favourite characters and have them as the leading characters again, since they wouldn't get a chance in the main series. I.e, Jill, Claire, Barry etc.   The entire point of the Revelations games are to reveal what has happened/what is happening to those characters.  But even at that, they still introduce plenty of new characters. So I really don't see the problem."
residentevil,32vh23,Sissle,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:01:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why Jill wouldn't have a chance in the main series. She's starred in two numbered games, Claire has previously starred in RE2 and RE:CV. Barry, I understand where you're coming from, but I think Jill or Claire could easily be featured in the next numbered game, and I'm betting that Jill definitely will appear in another numbered game in the future. Personally, I'm sick of Chris, if I see he is going to star in another numbered game I'll probably roll my eyes so hard that one of them won't return to its original position."
residentevil,32vh23,Sissle,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"Well, think of it this way, neither Claire or Jill had been playable characters in quite a long time.  Jills last game was Resident Evil 3 in 1999  Claires last game was Code Veronica in 2000/2001  That's well over a decade for both of them, since their last playable outing. Sure, Jill was in 5, but she wasn't a main playable character so I wouldn't count that."

And I don't mean that in a stupid yaoi fangirl kinda way, Krauser just seems like that kinda type who acts overly macho in denial. With all the BS science the series started cooking up, this is probably possible though. Confirmed, Krauser is Jake's mother."

residentevil,32wja6,Fozes,2,Fri Apr 17 11:34:11 2015 UTC,"Though I'm well aware that Jake is Wesker's son, but I just noticed how much these three actually look so much alike.  Coincidently I remember back when RE4 came out my cousin who isn't that into RE actually bought the game and we started playing, and I remember he actually confused Krauser with Wesker for a minute or two.  And though I was aware that Krauser died in RE4 I remember when I saw Jake for the first time in the RE6 trailer I remember noticing that he kinda had a strike resemblance to Krauser. I even though that maybe he might of been Krauser's ""good"" twin brother as to me Jake kinda appeared a little older in the trailer, till I played the game I notice that he was actually younger and as I looked even closer I noticed that he resembled Wesker.  Anyways I'm pretty sure that Krauser resembling Wesker was just as much of a coincidence as that of Steve resembling Leon.  PS= I know the premises of my post are stupid and as much as I don't see this ever happening I think I'm gonna die of a laugh attack if later on RE reveals Krauser being one of the Wesker Children.

That first trailer had Jill and Chris holding each other at gunpoint with some aussie in a chair talking smack to them. There were also regular old zombies if I remember right. That was pretty weird.
residentevil,32voh5,LexCrunch,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:32:22 2015 UTC,I remember that. I remember almost being disappointed once I actually played the game once it was ported.

I ended up not getting too far into the game until the console edition and didn't even think about this trailer until the credits ran and I was like hold on... What happened to Chris and Jill fighting?
residentevil,32voh5,MarcusQuintus,3,Sun Apr 19 14:59:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like Barrys' segments really hurt the game.  Neither Barry nor Natalia are fun to play as.  I don't mind that you have Assym co-op but there needed to be more development.  They should have made it so Claire couldn't knife at all and that Moira got other weapons than just a crowbar throughout the game.  She should be able to switch them out at will as well, with each having different qualities.  Maybe Crowbar, Axe, A baseball bat, and an electronic baton, like the one in Resi 5.  Crowbar is the All around weapon, Baseball Bat has largest range, Axe does most damage, and baton can stun, but has the least range."

residentevil,32qst2,LexCrunch,2,Wed Apr 15 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"I think they could have fun with it. It would make you wanna kill crap faster so being overwhelmed doesn't frighten you, and they could have little perks based off of it. And since Natalia doesn't give any fucks about fear anyways, she doesn't have to worry about it! Or perhaps maybe they could make that a little side game thing like they did with Countdown and Invisible mode."
residentevil,32qst2,LexCrunch,3,Wed Apr 15 23:49:07 2015 UTC,"I think it works fine as a plot device. Besides, it would have no effect on Natalia since she can't feel fear, and it would ruin the impact of discovering that Moira is immune. Barry doesn't have a bracelet or virus, so it would end up being a senseless gimmick to make Claire's levels and character more annoying than they already are. I already don't like Revs2 Claire for being a jaded bitch who constantly breaks character, but putting her at risk of panic attacks after having already survived at least three isolated viral outbreaks and monster infestations would be several steps further beyond suspension of disbelief."

The game was published first for the Xbox in 2005 and the PC version followed in 2006.  Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth combines an action-adventure game with a relatively realistic first-person shooter, combined with elements of a stealth game. The game is based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, author of ""The Call of Cthulhu"" and progenitor of the Cthulhu Mythos; the game is a reimagining of Lovecraft's 1936 novella The Shadow over Innsmouth. Set mostly in the year 1922, the story follows Jack Walters, a mentally unstable private detective hired to investigate a missing person case in Innsmouth, a strange and mysterious town that has cut itself from the rest of the United States.  In development since 1999, the project was repeatedly delayed, going through several revisions and having some of its most ambitious and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version canceled. Although well received by most critics, the final game was a commercial failure. At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions, including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End, but they were never completed due to Headfirst's failure to find a new publisher and their subsequent bankruptcy.

residentevil,32ppxr,magicalgames,4,Wed Apr 15 18:43:23 2015 UTC,"5 and 6 are better games than the ""Chronicles"" in my opinion.  They are just shooting games with weak supporting stories added to the plot.  If you like shooting its okay but it castrates any aspect of survival horror out of the game through sheer game play mechanics.  The whole sergie thing with the tyrants and wesker essentially just stealing umbrellas data to close the book on umbrella was a rather weak plot line.  Had they not added this there would have been room for a whole series of games on their own after CV and before 4 where our hero's do systematically take umbrella down in a way we can all be satisfied with.  Operation javier was a better story than its UC counterpart but its still unsatisfactory.  After all we went through with Claire in CV and the emotional roller coaster we went through with Steve to have it  culminate in essentially a giant plant, Krauser's arm, and a girl in permanent US gov't custody.    Again these stories could have been much better written and we have seen better writing in the RE series.  Gun survivor was a rail shooter but the story was better, instead of cloning sergie to make tyrants they kidnapped kids and scared the shit out of them and harvesting their brains for that chemical to make the tyrants is much more sinister and satisfying to see how far umbrella would go instead of just the cloning thing."

Granted, the pinpoint headshots, weapon customization, environment destruction, and extra pickups definitely spiced it up enough to make it worth playing, but it's still a rail shooter at the end of the day, and it plays out pretty much the exact same way every time. What would have completed the package for me personally would have been an elaborate gun peripheral with kickback and stuff.  They're not bad or anything, but they're definitely not among my favorites, and it's unfathomable to me that anyone would place them higher than 5 or 6 unless they had a raging boner for rail shooters, which is weird, but fine."

In terms of where I rank it, I can't really compare it to the main games because it's not really on the same level.

We've taken on a couple of new mods this week, and the plan is that they are going to help us redesign the stylesheet of the sub, and also get the word out - posting links to it in RE forums and stuff. We'll get some new subscribers that way!  Either way, I'm sure when E3 rolls around in a couple of months, there will be some new Resident Evil game announced, and we'll hopefully see a spike of interest then. Just gotta be ready to catch it, and retain some of the people who show up!"

residentevil,32mj3v,LexCrunch,2,Wed Apr 15 00:14:49 2015 UTC,I'm on the opposite side of the thought. I enjoy having subs related to specific characters where you can discuss aspects and share thing regarding said character.

Snipe the chains off the first door and run for it.  after gigante drops just turn around and run to the key and then to the next door.  Machine gun the chains on the next door and kick it down then run for the exit.  If you're fast enough El gigante won't be able to catch you or ashley.

The Omega team. They're all evil mercenaries hired by Umbrella via Irons to discredit STARS as an institution. So there's a bunch of boss fights with these guys.

residentevil,32em3h,bcclittlewill,5,Mon Apr 13 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"Oh man Claire and Ada becoming friends? I'd pay money to see that happen!  It's hard to say but as cliché as it sounds I would like to see an actual Leon and Chris team-up. What's really interesting about both of these characters is that they know of each other but they don't really know each other. Claire is their only mutual way, but as for Leon it was the result of a tragic life changing event. To think if it wasn't for Raccoon these men (maybe) wouldn't have known each other. Them slowly becoming friends throughout whatever screwed up ordeal they're thrown into, plus their realization of that fact could lead to an interesting, perhaps deep conversation on how bio-terrorism has changed their lives.  I think this series, at least with the newer games, really needs to give us some more insight on how the characters are feeling about viral outbreaks and B.O.Ws. None of them seem to be scared for their lives which is part of the reason why RE hasn't been scary. I know RE isn't exactly known for its deep emotional character development (or maybe it is, I haven't played all of them) but it would be great to see the characters like Leon and Chris show more of their human side."
residentevil,32em3h,Ryokyon,2,Mon Apr 13 06:13:36 2015 UTC,"Didnt Leon and Chris meet a couple times in RE6? Or did you mean something more personal?   Anyway, I think the 4 (5 if you count Sherry) stopped being scared after their initial games. Jill and Chris were all afraid in RE1, but by the time of RE3, Jill was prancing around the city in a tube top, skirt and boots with little to be afraid of other than Nemesis. Then Chris and Jill went on to actively seek out bioterrism. Leon and Claire were the same way, but by the end of RE2, Claire was like, ""okay what's next?"" Leon went to work for the government and deal with bioterrism as well. Even Sherry had enough of zombies and parasites by the time she came back.   Resident Evil does have character progression, and that's kind of what is making the games less scary. Moira was scared for her life, which made playing as her a little more tense than playing as Claire. Ashley was terrified which made RE4 a little more scary.   Just some food for thought."
residentevil,32em3h,CrimsonRex,3,Mon Apr 13 16:54:25 2015 UTC,"I want Claire & Jill, Jill & Sheva, Ada & Claire. I love Moira too maybe she'll be great with sherry. More girls please. I miss sheva"

The series has this kind of interesting kind of relation links thing, to put that into perspective, RE:Rev 2 is a good showing of it. Claire knows Moira and Barry, since Barry and Chris worked together, so Leon and Jill haven't ever met yet.  Leon and Chris is also a much needed one. And being really greedy, I want Ashley as a protagonist with someone, her RE4 experience giving her a better scope of the situation. PLEASE CAPUKOM."
residentevil,32em3h,kikaider007,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:47:08 2015 UTC,I can't see Ashley holding her own in any future games unless it's like the recent Revelations.

residentevil,32bn09,News_Bot,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"Gaiden came afterwards and was made by a completely different team. CAPCOM just wanted a GameBoy Color game. When the BIO1 port was scrapped, they contracted M4 Ltd. to make a new one."
residentevil,32bn09,crimsonstare,2,Tue Apr 14 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"You just reminded me I still have that game. I never got that far into it because I hated the controls. But, let's be honest here, what was I expecting from a GBC game."

residentevil,32bohh,NightmarishPT,4,Sun Apr 12 11:33:02 2015 UTC,"You want to do the speed run on Normal because you can't unlock the rocket launcher (for going under 3 hours) if you play on easy or very easy. I'm pretty sure getting the RL is what triggers the trophy.  Knife you can do on any difficulty. Definitely play as Chris, he does more damage with the knife and has more health."
residentevil,32bohh,Raven_257,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:12:27 2015 UTC,I think that Jill makes up for it with the being able to skip plant 42 thing.  Personal preference though.
residentevil,32bohh,DM_,3,Sun Apr 12 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"You can't get the under 3 hours achievement on easy or very easy because it doesn't trigger the unlocks, and that's what is actually required for the achievement.  For knife only I'd say Jill is probably easier, just because of the fact you don't have to fight plant 42 with her. Knifing only plant 42 is a bitch."
residentevil,32bohh,SilentBobVG,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"You could do a knife run on normal under 3h, or just do two separate runs. Beating the game in under 3h on normal or higher unlocks the rocket launcher, but the knife run can be done on any difficulty. So you can do a knife run under 3h, or you could do a normal run under 3h and then aldo a knife run on very easy (which is what I did). And use Chris for the knife."
residentevil,32bohh,mrbubbamac,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"I did my first speed run with Jill then with Chris on normal, eventually beating my records with the rocket launcher on any difficulty really. I did my knife only playthrough with Jill on Very Easy because it was my first time. I recorded my first gameplay videos doing that.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ9Zj25YAMhBaK5w-snbgajHQEq8iOFtc  Key thing about getting the speed run is just running past everything and getting the worst ending (skip Plant 42, let Barry die and skip the MOs to save Chris if you're playing Jill). After you master the speed run and remember all the routes, try it with no saves ;)  And for the knife only, also just run by everything and worry about the bosses. It's not as bad as it sounds once you get past the Elder Crimson head. All the bosses after him are super easy, just time consuming. Takes patience.   Good luck!"

residentevil,32bohh,jonhart989,2,Sun Apr 12 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"I've never done it personally, I would just use the V Jolt chemical. Still counts towards the cqc trophy/achievement too."
residentevil,32bohh,jonhart989,2,Sun Apr 12 19:30:01 2015 UTC,But if you want to I'm thinking you slash the tentacles

residentevil,32ar6y,baby_shoo-shoo,3,Sun Apr 12 17:56:53 2015 UTC,The defining moment is pulling the trigger for the first time in a raid mode level and watching the framerate disappear for 2 seconds.
residentevil,32ar6y,CFGX,2,Tue Apr 14 12:40:03 2015 UTC,When you realize you may have a nail polish fetish after staring at Alex's hands for small periods of time.
residentevil,32ar6y,CrimsonRex,4,Mon Apr 13 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"I dunno...after about....50-60 hours and clearing most of the states and stuff you realize how limited some of the raid design actually is. They just upped the randomization of the same set of enemies on the map(shock type, fire type, giant type, poison type etc) and for about 30 or so hrs thats fine.  But beyond that its incredibly limiting that the randomization is just on enemy attributes and not different enemies popping up. Swapping out like 10% of all enemies on each map with a random enemy type (vulcan blubber, Pedro, Hunter, executioner, skaagdead etc) would make some pretty big changes because once you memorize the what types spawn, its just repeating the motions.  Also there need to be more passive skills. It seems like they really over relied on the explosive bottles. None of the characters feel any different than the others outside of movement speed, and thats pretty sad really. Its the little things that help make each character feel more like individuals. If each character had set stats like...  Barry   +15% melee attack damage +10% Magnum capacity -30% shotgun capacity +20% fire damage resistance   Hunk   +20% finisher damage +30% melee attack speed -10% movement speed -30% grenade capacity +15% reload speed on all weapons -15% max HP   But this would all be shit you can upgrade some as you play to even some of this out it'd allow certain characters to keep some individual skills and abilities.   Just my opinion, I think raid mode is great but...it really needs more fine tweening, content, and stuff. I like the characters to feel different from eachother and so far thats limited to movement speed."
residentevil,32ar6y,wrathborne,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:44:38 2015 UTC,"After unlocking a rainbow Samarai Edge I realized that I had no desire to play anymore.

residentevil,32ar6y,Qwaarty,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:35:25 2015 UTC,"See and this is what Revelations 1 did right. I really enjoyed that aspect of individuality with the characters but I like the skill loadouts myself. If they incorporated both of these that would be awesome. Like you said have characters have native perks while having the diverse ""inherit/level up"" in this current game."

residentevil,329fyy,benmcbulla,13,Sat Apr 11 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"CAPCOM's biggest mistakes with their progression of the Resident Evil story were: 1. There is too much time in between each game. If you're gonna keep using the same cast of characters, you don't want them to start aging. Either make them chronologically close (e.g. RE 1,2,3,CV) or just don't include specific dates. 2. Too many characters have been added. Once a character comes into play, they're usually expected to come back in some form or another. Plus, a lot of the newly introduced ones are pretty lackluster. 3. They killed Wesker. Every antagonist we have after him will be shit in comparison.    [Edit] That being said, I don't think there should be a reboot. I love Rebecca, Jill, Leon, Barry, and the likes too much for them to go away."
residentevil,329fyy,JNmeister,5,Sun Apr 12 01:25:41 2015 UTC,"Not even just Wesker, but the entirety of fucking Umbrella and Spencer. All of my what. Like thanks for doing off-screen what the player should've done in an epic conclusion..."
residentevil,329fyy,ShadowLeggy,3,Mon Apr 13 14:15:17 2015 UTC,"This right here.    Forget Wesker for a moment: Resident Evil had such an interesting lore with regards to the historical background of Umbrella, the feuds among Spencer, Marcus and Ashford, the development Progenitor Virus into the T and G and Veronica virus, etc.  Pre-RE4 the highlight of the games wasn't the tank controls, but unraveling the mysteries of Umbrella Corp. and getting to know the characters more.  From day one it felt like the end goal was destroying Umbrella and perhaps one day facing the enigma that was Spencer, but then they leave Spencer's fate and Umbrella's demise as a simple footnote in the series.  WTF?  Now all of a sudden, we have so many viruses, corporations that it's a clusterfuck, and it doesn't help that they insist on introducing new characters when there are older characters we haven't heard from?  Where's Rebecca? Carlos? Billy? It all got way too convoluted for me."
residentevil,329fyy,everydayishalloween,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:55:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if it's revealed Spencer isn't dead. Look at how Wesker ""died"" in RE1. It happened the same exact way."

Maybe taking too much uroboros turned him into cell and there were a few that didn't get destroyed so he regenerated."
residentevil,329fyy,ICONOFGIRAFFE,4,Sun Apr 12 13:03:10 2015 UTC,They'll upload a secret Wesker brain scan into Jake or something.  It's Resident Evil.  Stupid crazy shit happening is the only plot device we'll ever get.
residentevil,329fyy,Tehok,2,Sun Apr 12 16:30:49 2015 UTC,"We get tons of plot devices, I'd even argue that nearly every point of the plot of any given game is somehow a device. That being said, your scenario is probably how they'll bring back Wesker. And when they do fans will cream their pants in spite of the fact that Wesker had lost his shine by RE5."
residentevil,329fyy,apollonius2x,5,Tue Apr 14 05:15:01 2015 UTC,I'm assuming he's got a stash of clone Weskers stored in some secret lab (like the Emperor in the Star Wars EU).  Cloning technology isn't too far fetched for RE and it could even open up some new variations on the alphabet soup virus collection we've been fighting over the years.
residentevil,329fyy,Nechaev,2,Mon Apr 13 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"If you think a death like that will prevent a villain from returning in this campy franchise, you're not paying attention. For all we know, we'll see a Wesker clone pop up with the exact same character motivations."
residentevil,329fyy,apollonius2x,4,Tue Apr 14 05:13:58 2015 UTC,"After RE5, I don't think I could have taken another game with Wesker in. He was just so campy by that point with his 60s Batman villain lines.  Just thinking of him saying ""There's no point in hiding"" and ""You're merely postponing the inevitable!"" makes me sad."
residentevil,329fyy,thedude2618,2,Sun Apr 12 11:17:10 2015 UTC,"Every villain in this series is campy, including Nemesis, but the winners by far are Midget Napoleon from RE4 and Cross-Dressing Schizo from RE:CV."

residentevil,329fyy,thedude2618,1 point,Tue Apr 14 07:25:03 2015 UTC,"You have a point, but if CAPCOM keeps making forgettable villains like ""Simmons"" or whatever his name was, then I'd rather take Wesker anyday. And even if he is campy, he's iconic. (And RE is campy in general)"
residentevil,329fyy,JNmeister,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"The only reason Wesker is iconic is because he was in the first RE game and because they kept bringing him back after that. If they'd brought Simmons back repeatedly he would have become ""iconic"" as well. Wesker was interesting for awhile but frankly I was pretty sick of his crap by RE5. Tyrant Wesker was a joke. Mr. Fantastic arms... give me a break."
residentevil,329fyy,apollonius2x,5,Tue Apr 14 05:17:14 2015 UTC,"I actually like the current story. Sure, it's sort of spiraling out of control, but I absolutely love the take on how zombies and bioterrorism attacks in general are a COMMON thing in the series and that the world is actively fighting against it, both politically and in combat. They've sort of deconstructed the zombie apocalypse trope.   While the gameplay might be a problem, it makes sense that it delves more into action (though some many of you may disagree, and that's totally okay).  In the first three games, the main characters were unprepared about the horrors in Racoon City. Now the world is fully aware of it, they have armies and organizations specifically to combat against it, so no worldwide apocalypse would ever happen."
residentevil,329fyy,notgospel,2,Sun Apr 12 08:27:33 2015 UTC,The only problem with this now is that it is hard to feel shocked anymore. It's always the latest and greatest BOW. The main protagonists go around the world like they're exterminators.  They have forced the genre to change from survival horror to action by evolving the story. its become an ordeal on such a huge scale.
residentevil,329fyy,BoxWI,0,Mon Apr 13 05:24:21 2015 UTC,"True, they're pretty much cashing from the franchise at this point, with all the spin-offs and non-canon games they make on the side. I really thought RE6 was the last chapter, especially with how it was marketed before it was released. But I don't know how the reboot would go after the story of Racoon City, if they're planning on making the ""survival horror"" in the series consistent."
residentevil,329fyy,notgospel,6,Mon Apr 13 11:49:24 2015 UTC,"There is no reason to reboot the story, so absolutely the current story.  The gameplay, on the other hand..."
residentevil,329fyy,Zaeh,3,Sat Apr 11 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"I'd like the same characters, but a complete reboot of the story. Give me a story I can get behind with characters that have real emotional angles."
residentevil,329fyy,Pitchswitch,3,Sun Apr 12 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"Neither/both. Remake RE2 in the same way RE1 was done, then do the same with RE3.  I'm not a big fan of Revelations but they could keep that going for those who love 'over-the-shoulder' action while pleasing those who love the game's survival horror roots."
residentevil,329fyy,thedude2618,4,Sun Apr 12 11:22:10 2015 UTC,I'd keep going with the current story. It doesn't need a reboot yet.   I do wish that they'd stop introducing a new cooperation or anti-terrorist group every game though

The throwaway organizations (and villains) that are introduced and defeated in the same game are probably what he means. Like Sacred Snakes, Neo-Umbrella, The Family, FBC and so on."

Take all of the RE characters as they are now and keep them in Revelations, and make that series more survival horror than action. I'd be fine with that compromise."
residentevil,329fyy,BoxWI,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:07:10 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but I haven't enjoyed the revelations games quite as much as the mainline ones. If anything, revelations should be the action series. First off, the production values for revelations aren't quite as good (e.g. the character models all look really wonky for some reason, like Jill/Barry's faces). Also, the type of action that takes place in revelations 1/2 is still nowhere close to the ""roots"" that CAPCOM said that they wanted to get back to. Plus, raid mode. If that isn't hi-octane, then I don't know what is."
residentevil,329fyy,JNmeister,3,Mon Apr 13 16:10:13 2015 UTC,"Reboot, this story has gone out of wack. Bring it back to its original elements. A survival horror game not some action adventure, quick time event thriller game thing."
residentevil,329fyy,SeriousNag,2,Sun Apr 12 02:34:49 2015 UTC,"That's just about gameplay though, wouldn't you agree?"
residentevil,329fyy,Zaeh,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:11:05 2015 UTC,"I would agree to an extent, the problem is the game play is kinda killing the story in a away. Its to action movie adventure which is the direction the story is being taken. I suggest that they go back before that to when the game play was simply, camera angles and sound that made you question your decisions. Which they would kinda need to reboot the story back to a time when the series was in its prime (at least in my eyes)"
residentevil,329fyy,SeriousNag,2,Mon Apr 13 23:28:48 2015 UTC,"Not at all, I don't think so. There isn't really any 'direction' the story is going, they're all just more or less independent stories. RE 6 had an action adventure, globetrotting conspiracy, multiple biohazards story because that's what they gameplay was suited for.   But then came Revelations 2 which is low-key story and more simplified, horror-esque gameplay. Set in the same universe as RE 6, but still being a toned down story set on a remote abandoned island. There's really no reason to reboot the story, as even Capcom has demonstrated that they can do both kinds."
residentevil,329fyy,Zaeh,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"Don't you think that is awkward though, if there just more or less independent stories then whats the point. Why not go back to when it was like a chain of events leading from one game to another. For example RE0 is the prequel to RE1, RE2 / RE3 come after the events of RE1. They all made sense an had a general story that worked with each other. It just seems once they released RE4 they kind of just said you know what lets just take characters from the old stories and just make something random."
residentevil,329fyy,SeriousNag,2,Tue Apr 14 00:55:34 2015 UTC,"RE 5 (and Revelations 2) continued from past events. But that has nothing to do with rebooting the story, it's just something that Capcom decided to do, probably to have the big main games more accessible (so you don't have to know 15 years of backstory to enjoy it). They might as well make stories that continued from game to game if they wanted even know. Although even back in the old days the games were more or less independent stories, despite some having the same setting.  The biggest difference to that is probably that back then the games were written by more or less one party, with multiple games being made simultaneously - and now we have each game written by a different new writer almost all the time, that's their all independent. Rebooting wouldn't really affect that at all."
residentevil,329fyy,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:03:08 2015 UTC,"I suppose, I guess what it comes down to is that I just miss the old resident evil. I'm not a fan of what they did to the game (just my opinion). I wish they just stayed true to the old setting and continued down a path that stayed somewhat true to the original story. It seems like after Code Veronica they just jumped ship and went in a direction that worked for newer players but growing up playing the old Resident evils made me just expect the same style till the games ultimate end."
residentevil,329fyy,SeriousNag,2,Tue Apr 14 01:09:16 2015 UTC,"To be fair, there wasn't much 'older story' to go forward with, especially after RE 5 when seemingly all loose ends were tied. Capcom changed, the games changed and times changed, so while it's unfortunate, there isn't really going back to those days anymore. If they'd now reboot the franchise and went back into Raccoon City, it wouldn't be anything like the older games, especially not in story and probably not in gameplay either."
residentevil,329fyy,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:15:12 2015 UTC,"But there is the issue, there is such a gap in time from when raccoon city was destroyed to when RE5 starts/Ends. They could have filled that with games. According to the timeline RE3/CV take place in 1998. Then they tie all loose ends in RE5 which takes place in 2009. In between that RE4 comes out which takes place in 2004 and has no real connection to the previous story besides Leon going from rookie cop to super agent. So there is this giant gap when I'm sure they could of came up with content (perhaps still can) much like they released RE0 after they released RE1. Timeline might not be 100% accurate but its close"
residentevil,329fyy,SeriousNag,2,Tue Apr 14 01:24:27 2015 UTC,"That's the point, they don't want the games to be closely tied to other material because they want them to be as accessible as possible (read: sell as much as possible). The current Capcom has taken an entirely different angle with the series, and it won't change with a reboot."
residentevil,329fyy,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:27:28 2015 UTC,"I know creating more spinoffs and whatnot would create chaos, but they ought to have the main number series focus on action, revelations which is a decent mix and fills in gaps from the main stories and has raid mode, and then maybe remake RE2 and call it Resident Evil Classic or something and keep the original gameplay styles. Once they run out of games to remake, they can keep the classic series going with new locations and characters."

residentevil,329fyy,CFGX,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:39:24 2015 UTC,"No it has not. I understand that the story has spread a lot for a game which is released once every to years, but we have Jake and Moira which can have a great story, Jill which we have not seen in a long time and so on. It has potential but I think they should concentrate on two things: Finding a good lead writer and a good lead developer."
residentevil,329fyy,LeviBellington,0,Tue Apr 14 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of people saying ""reboot! we want the old survival-horror style back!"" and I think that's not gonna happen anytime soon. The third person, action packed genre is much more lucrative for Capcom and tbh more modern.  Don't get me wrong, I'd like some more horror too but I think there won't be a new game in the pre-RE4 style anytime soon, maybe a REmake style reboot at most?  To answer the question, I think they will continue the story since some still need some wrapping up, like Leon and Ada."
residentevil,329fyy,bcclittlewill,-1,Sun Apr 12 11:48:23 2015 UTC,"I want the current story, but I want ""survival horror"" and not ""third-person shooter."""

Honestly, something is off about the eye textures and it's really distracting. Everyone just has huge anime-like eyes (especially Hunnigan holy crap) and it makes them all less intimidating. I bought it because I no longer have my ps2 version or my wii, so it was worth it for me, but if you still have your old copies I would say it's not worth it (unless you really just want to support Capcom)."

residentevil,32aal7,fourthwallcrisis,0,Sun Apr 12 02:05:43 2015 UTC,The HD version was a half-assed attempt to bring RE4 to modern devices. The audio is bad (monaural SFX) and the visuals seem to have some issues. The Wii version is the definitive edition.

residentevil,328tej,FruitBuyer,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:10:54 2015 UTC,Exactly my thoughts. I was pretty much okay with how the other games handled their event rewards. Maybe they'll get some feedback and change it up a bit.

I just think that instead of giving only a few people the skin maybe everyone should have gotten it for participating.

residentevil,327g1m,DeatheReaper,5,Sat Apr 11 08:19:15 2015 UTC,The annoying thing about this is that Capcom practically had 80% of RE2 environments and enemies remade when they made DSC.
residentevil,327g1m,chan_jkh,1 point,Sat Apr 11 09:01:56 2015 UTC,True
residentevil,327g1m,Zaeh,1 point,Sat Apr 11 12:43:19 2015 UTC,"The environments are a very small and straightforward part of making an RE 2 remake, though. There would be tons of other things as well, mostly trouble with game design and keeping the balance of old and new.  Although to be fair, the Darkside Chronicles environments barely held up for the previous generation, and they would need to be remade for the current one."
residentevil,327g1m,chan_jkh,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:25:34 2015 UTC,"Graphics are a small part, sure. It's still a huge tease to the point where they're almost trolling those who want a RE2make."
residentevil,327g1m,Zaeh,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:21:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was a tease towards any remake. The Chronicles games were just supposed to be quick summaries and 'recaps' of the main games. It's miles off from trolling, to be honest."
residentevil,327g1m,chan_jkh,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they're teasing towards a remake, they're teasing fans who have been asking for a proper RE2 remake for years.

There are a few things in this second game that feel a bit off but it's pretty good considering the budgeting and such.  Just wish some of the events/online functions would get fixed. That's the only real issue I have.
residentevil,327g1m,Zaeh,2,Sat Apr 11 12:20:45 2015 UTC,"You give the Capcom of today 'full force production values', and you won't be seeing an even remotely scary low-key game with atmosphere."

residentevil,327g1m,chofortu,7,Sat Apr 11 08:37:22 2015 UTC,"I mean, we are getting dangerously close to the point where over 50% of Resident Evil games are not set in Raccoon City. So we definitely need another Raccoon City game.  Set during the outbreak, Chris has laid false clues placing him in Europe, while he's actually trying to take Umbrella down from within Raccoon City. He enlists Rebecca's help, and she agrees to do so, as long as they look for Billy, who has been kidnapped by Umbrella for some reason. Chris says that's OK, but he'll arrest Billy when they're all safe. Rebecca flirts openly with Chris, who has been taking steroids in the months since the Spencer Mansion incident, and now has huge guns.  The two of them encounter Wesker and kill him, but then Wesker runs away because he wasn't really dead! Wow! They find Billy and start to escape. Rebecca keeps flirting with Chris ""oooh, what strong arms"" and Billy gets angry and admits he's jealous.  Ada appears and swings through some vines (she doesn't have her hookshot yet) and generally is obnoxiously enigmatic in both her words and her actions. She swings away without having really said anything.  The three protagonists press on and fight a big BOW. It explodes as it dies. Everyone falls down some stairs and they land in a pile. Rebecca goes for the kiss but Billy bats her away and says she misunderstood whom he was jealous of. Chris realises, and he and Billy make love while Rebecca drops her medical bag as she falls down a nearby sewer grate.  Claire finds Rebecca and mistakes her for Sherry, because she is high on green herbs. Rebecca, a botanist and medic, recognises the symptoms and humours Claire, leading her back to the real Sherry and sneaking away.  Billy takes Chris's handcuffs and chains him to a street lamp. Chris thinks Billy is just being romantic, but he actually wants to escape without being arrested. Chris starts crying as Billy runs away, also crying. Both broken-hearted.  The huge BOW from before, which exploded, begins to reform like the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Chris starts screaming as he is trapped. He has a flashback - a few minutes before the helicopter landed at Spencer Mansion two months ago. Chris is all hyped up and fistbumps Barry, who says ""whoa there, Chris! That hurt! You're really a master of punching!""  The camera zooms in to Chris's flashback eye then back out of his present-day eye. The BOW is fully reformed and about to kill Chris. He reaches into Rebecca's nearby medical bag and injects twelve syringes of STARS-brand steroids into his heart. His arms balloon to the size of oil drums and he punches the ground. The earth shakes and the street lamp shatters. Chris, freed, punches the monster and it blasts off into the sky like Team Rocket.  Billy runs into Rebecca and tells her Chris died of VD. Rebecca, though generally medically well-versed, is extremely prudish and naive about such things, so she believes him. As they get in a car, Jill, Wesker, Carlos, Barry, Brad, Marvin, Claire, Chris, Sherry, Leon and... Sheva show up. They all get in cars and simultaneously shout ""LET'S MAKE THIS INTERESTING"".  With that, the intro cutscene is over and Raccoon City Team Karting begins - a canon foray into the racing genre"

residentevil,325kcn,Stabstone,4,Fri Apr 10 19:48:04 2015 UTC,My theory. The RE movies. Love them or hate them the Resident Evil movies make money for some damn reason. The movies are full of dumb action and the only reason they get an R rating is because of language and the occasional Milla Jovovich nipple peak. There is hardly any gore in the RE movies.   I feel Capcom saw the success of the movies in America ( I dont know how they did over seas) and decided to tailor the games more in line with the movies to appeal to the movie going audience. So the games like the movies became more over the top action than using awesome practical effects and showing gore.   P.S. I hate the RE movies.

Though, I do agree that with the success of RE4 (loaded with action and straying away from survival horror), it KILLED survival horror, at least for the time being. I still think there could be a comeback. REV2 was a step in the right direction.  True survival horror is worrying if you have enough ammo, health, ink ribbons and WHAT IS GOING TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT FRIGGIN DOOR."

residentevil,321j5f,HobbieK,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:23:03 2015 UTC,The RE4 Save system is just fine. There's just too many save points in early levels. It gets more effectively when they become sparse at the end.

residentevil,31z04d,darklordoftech,5,Thu Apr 9 06:48:31 2015 UTC,"None of the Tyrants seen in the series are clones of Sergei. The clones have a different significance.   To conquer the problem, Birkin extracted a new variant that suppressed the influence on the brain to a minimum if it completely adapted.  But there were extremely few humans with the genes to adapt to the variant. In the Gene Analysis Section's simulations, only ""one in ten million humans"" would develop as a Tyrant and the rest would merely become Zombies.  If the research progressed, we should've been able to develop a different type of t-Virus which developed more humans as Tyrants. First however, a human who completely adapted to the new variant was required to study.   Sergei's clones were used to develop the t-Virus ""ɛ strain"" that allowed more humans to become Tyrants. Thus, Umbrella could create a Tyrant from almost any strong and healthy human. That was the process used to create the T-001, T-002, T-103, Thanatos, Hypnos-T, etc. The clones were introduced in order to explain this particular plot thread from Wesker's Report II that was left hanging for some reason."

residentevil,31tf3t,HobbieK,28,Wed Apr 8 00:44:47 2015 UTC,"Simple answer, Shinji Mikami is no longer with the company. He directed  RE1, REMake, and RE4."
residentevil,31tf3t,ryuken6,20,Wed Apr 8 00:58:10 2015 UTC,"Shinji Mikami hasn't exactly been producing hits...  Evil Within, Shadows of the Damned, Vanquish, PN.03, God Hand; all of these games did pretty terribly. Some of them are cult hits, yeah, I guess. But it's not like he's some kind of game producing mastermind like Hideo Kojima.  I think he just got lucky and was in the right place at the right time when RE1, REmake, and RE4 were brainstormed.  To answer OP's question, I think the real problem with RE's dwindling success (with hardcore fans, I should state, because they are still making moolah) lies with the fact that they KEEP trying to reproduce a hit in the vein of RE4. When RE4 came out, the whole ""over the shoulder"" 3rd person shooter was still fresh and most horror games hadn't broken out of the mold of 3rd person adventure game or first person shooter. Ever since RE4, video games have moved in a completely different direction than the old norm, so RE's action oriented nu-gameplay is old hat and doesn't really ooh and awe us like it once did.  It doesn't help that every game since RE4 has tried to shoe in hackneyed co-op gameplay that takes away from the overall feeling of loneliness that made RE scary to begin with.  If they want another hit like RE4, they're gonna have to ditch partner characters, stop the non-stop spawning enemies (it's not scary to fight waves of goons, it's annoying), stop creating set pieces that alert the player instantly to a fight with monsters (""Wow, i wonder why there are so many crates to take cover behind in this huge, empty space?""), get rid of the macho man gun show arsenal (save that for EX game modes), and find a locale that feels fresh and hasn't been done yet.  No one wants to play yet another game where you're a super agent stuck in a rural village out in [INSERT EXOTIC 3rd WORLD COUNTRY HERE]."
residentevil,31tf3t,nectarousness,7,Wed Apr 8 02:19:36 2015 UTC,Did Evil Within not do well? Looked like decent review wise
residentevil,31tf3t,mrbubbamac,8,Wed Apr 8 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"It got alright reviews, but it didn't really sell well (in Japan, at least, but that'll probably be what kills it) and from what I hear, no one really cared about it after a couple of months. Not only that but it was meant to be a spiritual successor to RE, but not many RE fans I've spoken to really liked it."
residentevil,31tf3t,nectarousness,4,Wed Apr 8 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"First half was horror perfection. Tense, dark, scary.  Then it went fullblown re5 action. That ending..."
residentevil,31tf3t,lskennedy,5,Wed Apr 8 18:10:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""no RE fans"", I quite liked what I've played (don't own the game so haven't played through the whole thing) of Evil Within and I'm a RE fan, even up to RE5.  It's a little bit of a ""forced"" tension kind of game, instead of giving you very little to fight with, it gives you nothing, but it works quite well and looks great.  I look forward to playing the whole thing."
residentevil,31tf3t,shrediknight,4,Wed Apr 8 06:51:04 2015 UTC,Its an amazing game. Its terrifying and dark. I loved it.
residentevil,31tf3t,thedeadlinger,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:48:20 2015 UTC,"You're right, I probably shouldn't have said that since I'm only thinking about the handful of RE fans I've talked to about The Evil Within as an example margin.  I've just been told that its game play wears thin fast and that there isn't much in the way of story and characters."
residentevil,31tf3t,nectarousness,-1,Wed Apr 8 14:44:11 2015 UTC,"Not true at all, Evil Within is a great game with some excellent tension. Has some flaws and it's clear that Mikami is shaking off the rust, but if there's a sequel, they might just make it really great -- it's better than anything RE since 4 except for Revelations 1, which was very good. The thing is that RE4 hit at a time when it was so much needed and it literally re-invigorated the survival horror genre -- its atmosphere, story, tension, setting, everything is just superb for that genre. It is the single finest example of survival horror we might ever see, so it's not surprising at all that we haven't seen anything as good since (except Last of Us, which got really close)."
residentevil,31tf3t,andycpsu,2,Wed Apr 8 14:45:00 2015 UTC,Except one person's opinion doesn't make other people's untrue. I'm just merely stating what I've heard over the months from other people.
residentevil,31tf3t,nectarousness,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:51:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, just don't like absolutes. I'm a RE fan, grew up with the genre and I think it's a game worth checking out and after putting some serious time in, most old-school survival horror fans I would hope will see that it has some merit. I see what Mikami was trying to do. He didn't accomplish all of it, but he def is doing a much better job than Capcom right now and that includes Rev2 (yes I think it's a better game than rev2, except Raid mode which is worth the purchase alone)."
residentevil,31tf3t,andycpsu,0,Wed Apr 8 15:00:22 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll edit my comment to sound less ""absolute.""   Anyhow, my original comment was pretty much trying to say that Mikami's not the lone mastermind and REmake/RE4 benefited from a handful of creative dudes. Even though Mikami's doing his own thing, and from what you say about TEW it seems to be hitting a majority of the notes, I think we can all agree that it would be better if the old gang were still together to help him fill in the gaps.  I just don't think he'll be able to replicate the past successes 100%.... but who knows? I'm not stating anything as fact yet."
residentevil,31tf3t,nectarousness,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:09:00 2015 UTC,"For sure -- if Mikami was the sole mastermind behind 4 (which I agree he wasn't) then it was truly lightning in a bottle. His legacy of work has proven that he is not necessarily the visionary that we might have made him out to be. He definitely needs help as EW was great but had a lot of flaws -- a lot of issues that he shouldn't even be having since he already did 4 and worked through a lot of them, but I think that's the massive rust he has to work off. Capcom also has massive directional issues with how it wants its series handled. Hire some better people and make something as good as Last of Us (which is not easy to do) -- put the real work in and get back to basics and give us the characters we want without the gimmicks and bs that just detracts. I don't want co-op -- can't I just have Claire in a game as good as code veronica? I just think Capcom is really lost right now with what it wants to do..."
residentevil,31tf3t,andycpsu,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:41:38 2015 UTC,It's sad but it seems Capcom is just in it for the money these days. The repeat incidents of day 1 DLC just goes to show that.

residentevil,31tf3t,devon223,3,Wed Apr 8 03:15:34 2015 UTC,"I think that the Resident Evil team just had great synergy with Mikami. Both great, but much better together."
residentevil,31tf3t,EQUASHNZRKUL,2,Thu Apr 9 08:06:23 2015 UTC,"The best answer.   I'd also like to add that, I believe, that Capcom is now way too focused on DLC and in-game purchases. For me, that really hurts the enjoyment of these games. It's why I barely enjoyed RE5, hated RE6, and now have lost all interest in the current titles."

residentevil,31tf3t,LexCrunch,2,Wed Apr 8 04:36:30 2015 UTC,"Likely, but 7 million units was a higher percentage from the installed base of the ps2 &  GameCube, re5 wasn't as influential and was released to a much bigger installed base."
residentevil,31tf3t,drupido,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:05:57 2015 UTC,And Transformers: Age of Extinction was the highest grossing film of last year.
residentevil,31tf3t,mrbubbamac,9,Wed Apr 8 10:45:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think its because Capcom doesn't understand what was so great about it, and thus are unable to replicate it. The gameplay, bosses, pacing, tone, and environments were perfect. RE5 is almost a copy paste of all the action parts of RE4 but with coop. They thought it was great because it took place in a foreign country and it was different. The real reason was because it was a new and unknown environment, and had a creepy atmosphere. So now the last 3 RE games have this focus of having to take place in brand new environments in other countries. They thought fans liked the action oriented gameplay. What was actually good about it was the immaculate pacing of the game and the combination between tension and action. So RE5 has very little in between large action sections and gunplay.  Kind of a long answer, but they can't replicate the formula because capcom doesn't understand why RE4 was so special, evident because every game after it is a copy paste of the wrong elements."
residentevil,31tf3t,Polite_Werewolf,11,Wed Apr 8 02:06:03 2015 UTC,"Capcom completely understands what they're doing. They don't listen to reviews, they listen to numbers. Resident Evil 4 was made at a time when the franchise was losing fans and got huge numbers and universal acclaim. So, they wanted to go farther into that direction with Resident Evil 5 and that also sold very well. Resident Evil 6's sales set a new record for Capcom.    They know exactly what they're doing."
residentevil,31tf3t,mrbubbamac,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:59:00 2015 UTC,"It may have set a sales record, but it was millions short of what they wanted. I truly believe the reason RE5 is the best selling capcom game is solely because of how high quality re4 was. Taking it more action oriented left some people bitter, so they tried to recoup that by calling RE6 ""dramatic horror"" or whatever, and said each campaign was a different experience and old fans will love it. RE6 did not surpass 5, and still fell below expectations. I think they are understanding the sales trends but don't know how to recapture the magic with 4"
residentevil,31tf3t,GogglesPisano,3,Wed Apr 8 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"RE4 is one of my favorite games - I've re-played it dozens of times on the PS2, PS3 and PC.    Beyond the obvious (over-the-shoulder POV and action sequences), there are lots of little touches that make the gameplay in RE4 fun - things like harvesting eggs or loot from snakes and crows, fishing in the lake, backtracking to find newly spawned enemies, the shooting gallery, and encountering the merchant.  RE5 and RE6 for the most part lacked surprises like this, and as a result they felt more scripted and linear to me."

RE6 is considered awful by the hardcore  fans, but to Capcom, it was a hit, as it made them tons of money. Capcom wants money, the fans want horror, which is much riskier than making a zombie/sorta zombies-filled multiple-campaign action-thriller."

residentevil,31tf3t,MoonSloth,2,Thu Apr 9 01:24:22 2015 UTC,"I've said it before.  I think the original RE style was better.  More horror/surival/puzzle focused.  Resident Evil 4 was a very nice change or detour.  Lots more action, still some horror and puzzles.  But in the end it was a step in the wrong direction and Capcom hasn't left that path yet.  The new games are MORE action and LESS horror/survival/puzzle.  The problem is, IMO, they're not very good action either."
residentevil,31tf3t,MoonSloth,2,Wed Apr 8 15:26:01 2015 UTC,-No more Shinji. -Forcing the bullshit coop and selectable mission levels down our throat. -Jet setting all around the world with a dozen characters just to live out a ridiculous Micheal Bay film. -Trying to make it a multiplayer affair. -Excrutiatingly annoying quick time events.

The castle portion was a let down compared to the village, and the island down right terrible. Only thing that saved it was the Regenerators. It's also the game that ruined the series as far as I see it.   However, why it was such a hit I think boils down to these reasons: * Fresh take on the series. * It improved 3rd person shooting (which now every game copies) * Got rave reviews which shifted units and helped it gain fans where as RE5 got above average opinions and RE6 was spat on."

residentevil,31tpp4,mrbubbamac,5,Wed Apr 8 02:07:13 2015 UTC,"Okay so I played RER1 in order to play RER2, so I played them right after another.   What I loved about RER1:   Jill! Setting was new and interesting Story had it's twists As a 3DS port it was really impressive The enemies had a cool design imo   What I disliked:   God dont get me started on Jill's face... Technical limitations were really noticeable in environments, enemy diversity, gun impact I hated almost everybody involved in the story, especially Parker and O'Brian   What I liked about RER2:   The story was great, I was dying to know how it turns out Barry was so funny, Moira's sailor mouth was great! Claire was super badass, loved it Some really cool levels and enemies  I liked the dodging, made the fights more fluent imho   What I didnt like:   Waayyyy too tame for a Resident Evil Game (I disliked that about RER1 too but I blamed it on the limited hardware possibilities) There were like 3 different enemies? Rather short   I have to criticise the limited melee in both games, I loved choosing between a knee or a headshot and executing different moves. And both games had heavy level recycling  Overall I loved RER2 because I love the characters and the gameplay and RER1 was fresh and interesting but I'd prefer RER2 everytime"
residentevil,31tpp4,LeviBellington,2,Wed Apr 8 23:24:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything here.  My five cents:  Jill's face in Rev1. What the hell happened there? Claire's face in Rev2 was pretty busted-up looking too.  I also wasn't happy with Jill's voice - I found Patricia Ja Lee from RE5 was spot on, and felt pretty disappointed she was replaced. It was sad to see Alyson Court replaced as Claire too, but I thought the new actress sounded fine. The supporting cast in Rev1 were all seriously awful. Pedro/Gabe/Neil etc in Rev2 were pretty forgettable too, but I didn't think they were offensively bad like the Rev1 cast."
residentevil,31tpp4,AndTheBeast,2,Thu Apr 9 12:16:37 2015 UTC,"I just didnt care about Pedro/Gabe/Neil but I really HATED the supporting characters in RER1.  I gotta say I absolutely love Claire's face and especially her raspy voice, gave her a grizzled and badass vibe (Even though it might not exactly fit with her being from TerraSave and not the BSAA)  Yep I really hate Jill's face in RER1, I can see what they tried to do with the eyes but I cant comprehend the nosejob they gave her."
residentevil,31tpp4,LeviBellington,2,Thu Apr 9 16:52:19 2015 UTC,"The thing that kept me from playing / replaying Rev 1, was the parts where you weren't Jill."
residentevil,31tpp4,DrHoenybun,2,Fri Apr 10 13:10:20 2015 UTC,"Good lord the levels with Parker in Terragrigia were terrible  I actually didnt hate Keith and Quint that much, they were some kind of comic relief I guess"
residentevil,31tpp4,LeviBellington,4,Fri Apr 10 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is forgetting to compare the raid modes as well. Lol.  (Go straight to TLDR if you don't feel like reading a wall of text)   Its a tough call between the two games. Because where one failed slightly, the other one triumphed slightly. Revelations 1 was actually more scary(at least the Jill parts). The stories in both were pretty good. The fluidity/gameplay in Revelations 2 was a little better due to it not being a handheld port. The characters in both were all great.   Overall, campaign wise. Revelations 1 and 2 tied.  Now for the exciting part. The raid mode. Right off The bat people might say revelations 2 raid mode is better. But I actually think revelations 1 raid mode was better. Here's why. Although in RE 2 you have tons of missions and a bit more enemy types, the mission as themselves have hardly any substance honestly. Most are just 5 minute missions. Then you have to wait 4 minutes every time to connect to resident evil.net. overall, the wait time with revelations 2 is much higher. Revelations 1 raid missions had more substance since they we're more akin to the story mode. Abilities in revelations 2 are great, but they make raid mode too easy. Revelations 1 made you bettee due to trying to not get hit for trinity bonuses. In revelations 2 you merely have to not heal. You can even revive and still get completions medallions.  Last but not least.... GHOST SHIP IS THE BEST LEVEL IN THE ENTIRE REVELATIONS SERIES. hands down. basically playing across entire campaign speed run style. You could even skip what you wanted if you didn't want to get trinity, and simply beat Norman for end game loot. I haven't personally got to the higher leveled missions in revelations 2, but I'm pretty sure nothing can beat ghost ship.  TLDR: Revelations 1 is slightly better in raid and story. Revelations 2 has nothing on revelations 1's ghost ship."
residentevil,31tpp4,ZXE102R,6,Sun Apr 19 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"I liked 1 better in almost every way. 2 has a couple of things that trumped it though. Barry, for one, was a welcome return to the series. Second was the design of chapters, sub-goals, and unlocks which has been a very refined and enjoyable replay experience with the main campaign.   Some elements of co-op gameplay were innovative as well, but I would have preferred it in smaller doses. It is a richer experience progressing through a story when secondary playable characters do not simply exist as your sidekick the entire time."
residentevil,31tpp4,BoxWI,7,Wed Apr 8 05:08:13 2015 UTC,"I think Revelations 2 is a huge improvement over 1. It's a colossal improvement over 6 that's for sure. LoL I feel as if they tried to mix in some Last Of Us into RE. Which worked for me. It wasn't perfect, but it was the most fun I've had playing a RE game story mode since 4. They were really just missing one thing, HORROR! They just didn't really put in any scary moments. I was never cautious about turning those corners. The last game that had those moments was RE4. They refuse to bring them back for some reason."
residentevil,31tpp4,SouljAx360,2,Wed Apr 8 06:49:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Claire's first episode was pretty creepy, as well as the village in the beginning of Episode 2, but a drop off in tension after that"
residentevil,31tpp4,HobbieK,7,Wed Apr 8 12:16:41 2015 UTC,"The Co-op is nice, but I really loved the environments of Rev1 so much more. Exploring the Queen Zenobia was so cool and felt new. Walking through villages and labs felt old.  The weapons are better in Rev 1, the Enemies are cooler in Rev 1, Rev 1 is just better.  Rev 1> Rev 2"
residentevil,31tpp4,jandc86,2,Wed Apr 8 10:50:10 2015 UTC,"Coop is kind of cool, the asymmetric design makes it a lot more interesting. I agree that the Queen Zenobia was a better environment, and I really liked how there were breaks in the first one where you would play as other characters and different environments (the snow levels, terragrigia, etc), it broke up any monotony in the game. Rev 2 was a lot more linear and though there were multiple environments in each episode, I like to have a massive environment you explore more and more of as you go along.   Although I enjoy the aqua-themed enemies, I think the enemy design in Rev2 is even better. I can spend so much time viewing the enemy figurines and you see how disgusting and creepy they are. I think the afflicted are a great mix between the characteristics of Ganados and zombies.   Weapons are about the same for both id say, but I'm not too far in raid mode so I can't say for sure yet."
residentevil,31tpp4,JoeKrauzer,4,Wed Apr 8 12:22:07 2015 UTC,"2 is better than one but I wish it had more enemy types, and mini bosses. The slaughter house could of had it's own cool boss, instead of a fat guy with a fire cannon?"
residentevil,31tpp4,jandc86,2,Wed Apr 8 14:29:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  As I was walking around that area on the way in, I couldn't help but feel like there was going to be a sweet boss.

residentevil,31tpp4,darklink34,2,Wed Apr 8 06:24:14 2015 UTC,"For me id probably put the campaign for Rev 1 above 2, but no doubt about it Raid mode is awesome in Rev 2. I think it was really smart to reuse Re6 levels, it adds a lot more variety than running through the same campaign locations in the first one."
residentevil,31tpp4,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Wed Apr 8 12:15:22 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they decide to catch this trend on and bring back some RE5 levels too. Kinda like how The Mercenaries 3D had revisits to some of the older levels in their missions.
residentevil,31tujn,chofortu,4,Wed Apr 8 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, same here. I'm speculating, but I bet this delay has something to do with the cheating... the top two scorers for the event allegedly beat the stage on Level 0. And I could be wrong, but it seems unlikely that it's possible to beat the stage in less than 90 seconds on Level 1. Maybe with rocket launchers or something, idk.  Anyway, the results will be available in 18 hours and 40 minutes."

Running next to you, as an unbalanced character (Wesker or safari Chris with his damn rpg), and shooting you while you were trying to deal with the majinis, was just completely awful and dumb. The standing and shooting is a horrible gameplay mechanic for multiplayer deatmatches.  So yeah, overall the versus mode is bad."

residentevil,31pr8j,ReddWing44857,4,Tue Apr 7 09:51:57 2015 UTC,The original story had leon being in raccoon city when.the outbreak starts. He and several officers and survivors hole up in the police station. So it makes sense he'd have on tactical gear in that case. I'm assuming they kept the outfit when they changed the story cause they liked it better. The director did say he didn't like the other drafted outfit for leon cause it looked too similar to chris.

residentevil,31qbeu,iPickled,3,Tue Apr 7 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"As long as they aren't empowered with the speed buff you can kite them quite easily or bait out their melee attacks by running past them. They habe a hard time hitting you if you keep moving.  However, I don't think there's a reliable way to stun them, so if they do move quicker than the ordinary scagdeads your best bet is to use frost bottles or decoys and aim for the head. I don't mess around with the quick ones because they can combo you to death with their running animation.  Hope this helps."

This gives you the a very powerful weapon that will be accurate at long range and can stun the scagdead with every few shots.  You won't get any head shots unless you correct your aim like a sniper would but the trade off for consistent, accurate shots has been worth the trade."

I thought the game was pretty fun, held my interest, but in general it felt like a big mashup of generic RE ideas from various different games with a lot of fan service. The game itself is only really saved by the fact that it is a RE title with high production values, though the levels themselves and the enemies they're populated with are rarely all that impressive or interesting. The last chapter, though - in spite of the fact that it's a major retread of a previous RE chapter - worked really well. I think it was the first RE situation featuring the over-the-shoulder 3D shooter system that was set in an enclosed, spooky-type mansion. It was definitely my favorite part of the game, though I tended to prefer Claire's sections over Barry's (except her last chapter was pretty insulting). (Yes, there are some spooky-mansion-esque moments in RE4, but they don't capture the classic feeling the way this chapter with Barry does)."

residentevil,31h2jz,mrbubbamac,13,Sun Apr 5 00:38:17 2015 UTC,"RE4 had the best deaths by far.  Chainsaw decapitations, full facial acid burns, getting chopped in half, dagger to the neck, etc.  5 and 6 were way too tame.  Getting chainsaw'd simply did not have the same effect as it did in 4.  Really hope they bring back the gore that made 4 so memorable."
residentevil,31h2jz,jaredletosombrehair,3,Sun Apr 5 02:38:18 2015 UTC,Ahhh or getting stabbed in the face with the blind clawed men.

residentevil,31h2jz,The_Gecko,2,Sun Apr 5 00:40:12 2015 UTC,It really set the tone for the games. My first RE was also RE2. I was out of breath by the time I hit the police station.
residentevil,31h2jz,SherlockJones1994,2,Sun Apr 5 01:02:07 2015 UTC,And mine. I've played other games but 2 was my first and my favourite.
residentevil,31h2jz,purplesascwatch,3,Sun Apr 5 09:47:56 2015 UTC,"3 was my first and is my favorite! But 2 is still pretty awesome :D my top 5 list goes 3, 4, Remake, 2, 0, DS (best version of the original original)"
residentevil,31h2jz,SherlockJones1994,3,Sun Apr 5 15:23:03 2015 UTC,Finally some love for 3! It was one of the harder ones of the series IMO but I liked the little choice sections and how a lot more of the game took place in the city. I thought it would be more breathtaking for the time it came out but a lot of RE fans tend to overlook 3.
residentevil,31h2jz,purplesascwatch,2,Sun Apr 5 20:56:03 2015 UTC,exactly! the scope was pretty awesome back in the day with some cool rpg mechanics and the dodge was nice even though it was a little finicky. Loved nemesis and nikolai were both cool villains and the city was extremely memorable. god now i wanna play it :P
residentevil,31h2jz,SherlockJones1994,3,Sun Apr 5 21:09:45 2015 UTC,I have it downloaded on my psvita. Beat it on GC a while back but I'm stuck at the church gift with nemisis...
residentevil,31h2jz,purplesascwatch,2,Sun Apr 5 21:35:00 2015 UTC,oh that church battle can be hard! did you make the choice that led to carlos destroying nemesis's rocket launcher? dont forget to dodge!
residentevil,31h2jz,SherlockJones1994,2,Sun Apr 5 23:46:16 2015 UTC,Hard to dodge on vita...and no mag rounds only fire and regular grenades

residentevil,31h2jz,MoonSloth,2,Sun Apr 5 04:29:00 2015 UTC,And this awesome sound played right before it! https://youtu.be/EREatEhGhNM
residentevil,31h2jz,LeviBellington,2,Sun Apr 5 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"Oh Capcom. I don't know why I found it so gratifying to here that cheerful diminuendo right before the terror, but I did."
residentevil,31h2jz,LeviBellington,2,Sun Apr 5 14:45:27 2015 UTC,I miss it! Something about that sound put me into survival horror mode.
residentevil,31h2jz,turboS2000,2,Sun Apr 5 15:06:23 2015 UTC,"Okay this might sound weird but I really love the violence and gore in Resident Evil.   Dont get me wrong, violence is bad yada yada but we're talking about fucking Resident Evil for god's sake! I dont really need excessive gore in other games like shooters etc but RE is about death and horror, it really adds to the immersion and experience. When Leon got beheaded by the chainsaw for the first time in RE4 I was genuinely scared of the chainsaw guy  RE4 was perfect for that matter imho, RE6 was okay but RER2 is way too tame in my opinion. Especially with the cruel and fearsome setting"
residentevil,31h2jz,CrimsonRex,3,Sun Apr 5 16:02:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, RER2 is extremely toned down even compared to later entries. Blood disappears, hardly any gore, no visual effects when you hit enemies (bullet holes on the enemies, head shots, etc). The enemy design is very awesome in the game, and some of them are quite gruesome, but then when I fire a Magnum at an afflicted, I want to see them get decimated! I do think the ironheads are some of the coolest enemies in any RE game so far."
residentevil,31hb0z,mrbubbamac,8,Sun Apr 5 01:59:57 2015 UTC,"Some of this will sound like the other answers already present, but:   Resident Evil 4 was just perfectly executed. It was the perfect mixture of survival, horror, action, and it added so many new features to the series it made Resident Evil fresh in a way it wasn't done before. Quick time events were not played out back then, and I found them enjoyable, placed intelligently ect.  Resident Evil 5 was an absolutely epic co-op game, with great Resident Evil story and characters. Sure it wasn't survival horror, but it was a fantastic and fun entry in the RE universe. To this day I would say RE5 has the highest replay value, since the experience can be fun with many different friends. It had a really good co-op system, it had a great upgrade system, fun jewel collecting, and fun BSAA emblems to collect. I highly recommend playing this with your best friends on professional! Intense and fun. Also great boss fights and well placed QTE's.  Resident Evil 6 felt really flawed, or like it didn't know what it wanted to be, but I will say I loved the amount of content that was in the game. I loved how many different characters you could play, and see the story unfold for. I loved the Chris vs Leon moment, obviously done as a fan service, and even though I felt there were many missteps it was still a fun co-op experience with a friend. I wouldn't say it's quite as good at anything as any other entry in the series, but it's still a lot of bang for the buck."
residentevil,31hb0z,DoomDash,2,Sun Apr 5 03:17:00 2015 UTC,"For me, RE5 was fun because it took all the action parts of RE4, condensed it to a shorter game, and allowed you to play it with your friends. It was never scary, just fun and satisfying to blow up monsters with friends. Even coop in RE6 I don't think matched up to RE5."
residentevil,31hb0z,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sun Apr 5 03:29:36 2015 UTC,"It had a few scary parts for me (seriously fuck the bugs they're awful), but I found RE5 to mostly be an adrenaline-rush in certain places. Also Wesker... Ohhhhhhhhhh so much fun!"
residentevil,31hb0z,fourthwallcrisis,3,Sun Apr 5 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"I liked being able to jump into random people's games as a monster in 6. It wasn't terribly well executed, but it was a great addition that should be done more often."
residentevil,31hb0z,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sun Apr 5 03:43:20 2015 UTC,"I thought the campaign cross overs were very cool. I played it pretty soon after it was out, so being able to play as Ada and snipe for another two players who were playing as Jake and sherry in their respective campaign was really sweet."
residentevil,31hb0z,SouljAx360,2,Sun Apr 5 04:03:20 2015 UTC,I remember setting up crossover plays with a group of friends. Two and two in different campaigns waiting for each other so we could all play together. Got a few good moments in for sure.
residentevil,31hb0z,LeviBellington,2,Sun Apr 5 17:33:58 2015 UTC,This was one of the reasons I kept on playing RE6 after I'd finished it. It was pretty fun and I wasn't too much into online play last generation so this was a nice easing into online functionality to me. :)
residentevil,31hb0z,hercoldhands,3,Sun Apr 5 13:40:18 2015 UTC,"RE4 tried to be a RE game. I didn't like the locations, but they did a good job making it a horror based action game I thought. Maybe my memories of horror from that game are coming from those creatures on the island facility near the end of the game though.  RE5 was just a great co op game. It lacked any real horror, I mean it was there but terrible. The Mercenaries mini game however... well I have 3k hours in The Mercenaries between PS3/360/PC. Can't stop playing it in co op mode since 2k9. And I have a lot of people to play it with I'm not the only one who's still playing it since the beginning.  RE6 tried to... you know what I have no idea what they were going for with RE6. If you step back and look at what they did just as an idea for a game it seems great. But then you play it and it just seems really poorly executed. One thing I did like about RE6 was the bosses. I just thought they were really cool. I love dinosaurs, so I was pretty excited about that one boss that people thought was stupid. I thought it was awesome and put in as a tribute to Dino Crisis. Once I finished with the story I tried to play Mercenaries after loving RE5 Mercenaries for so long. And to me it was a complete disaster. The only thing I can think of that was good about it, was that the characters felt more balanced. And had more characters/outfits/loadouts combinations. I guess the RE6 disc could be a nice coaster as well, that's a positive."
residentevil,31hb0z,PyroSpark,3,Sun Apr 5 10:35:36 2015 UTC,I really liked the Africa setting of RE5.   I remember the boat level where you have to fight crocodiles. That's a common scene in Resident Evil (Area flooded with enemies submerged in water) but in this setting I thought it was refreshing.
residentevil,31hb0z,JayKayGray,4,Sun Apr 5 11:01:45 2015 UTC,Re4 is very easy to get into but also intriguing enough to make you want to play the earlier games.  Re5 was pretty fun co-op.  RE6 has a good plot and Piers. Piers is my favorite.
residentevil,31hb0z,fourthwallcrisis,4,Sun Apr 5 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"Re4 was a fantastic single player experience.   RE5 has fucking amazing co op. (I put hundreds of hours in team survivors...)  RE6 had the most fun mercenaries in the series, easily, due to the extremely upgraded controls."
residentevil,31hb0z,REsoleSurvivor1000,4,Sun Apr 5 02:30:07 2015 UTC,"I like the length of RE6's various campaign modes aswell. They all offer a fun, different experience and paint such a huge story."
residentevil,31hb0z,darklordoftech,2,Sun Apr 5 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"I actually consider RE4 a pretty much perfect game. Right amount of atmosphere, tension, gunplay. RE5, was too much action for my tastes, but coop play was a blast and for the most part I enjoyed the plot, and how much it delved into the past of Umbrella. In RE6,  I found the game mediocre overall, though I enjoyed the European setting for sections of Chris and Jake's campaign, and Mercenaries mode in RE6 with the revamped controls is an absolute blast. I don't think the controls suit well for a horror game, but as an action minigame, I think mercenaries was awesome."
residentevil,31hb0z,EQUASHNZRKUL,3,Sun Apr 5 02:02:53 2015 UTC,"Good points, I tend to agree. It really does get the horror atmosphere while still having fast-paced gameplay."
residentevil,31hb0z,BustaGrimes1,2,Sun Apr 5 03:42:02 2015 UTC,"Well here's my take on the three games:   Resident Evil 4: Just as /u/DoomDash mentioned it was VIRTUALLY PERFECT. Horror, story, characters, environments, gameplay. It pretty much captured elements from older games and made it into something newer. Lots of great moments from that game for sure. Resident Evil 5: Appearance. Action. Coop play. It had a bunch of great aspects that often get overlooked in the community. Mercenaries mode for one. This (asides from RE4 and RE3's different variation on it) was the peak of this game mode IMO. Logged sooooooooooo many hours on it even though I unlocked everything ages ago beforehand. Aside from that, even if it's cheap, I was a fan of the melee/pickup/climbing i-frames to dodge things as well as quick-reload via inventory switches. So many shenanigans doing this. Plus: WESKER! That whole thing was just too great to look over. Resident Evil 6: I myself enjoyed this game despite the hate it receives. I will admit it did lack the replayability to me (at least with the story mode I just couldn't get back into it easily). However I will add that the coop 4-player in different campaigns gimmick was awesome fun if you could gather friends to do it. I really hope Capcom considers bringing this function back in the future. Another thing: Mercenaries. Great amounts of fun and I love the soundtrack for it. Not much else to add other than what's already been mentioned really. Except... Chris/Piers playground... Never forget the panda... Never."
residentevil,31hb0z,SilentBobVG,2,Sun Apr 5 17:43:50 2015 UTC,We finally get to see Oswell Spencer in 5. It was about time that we got to see the biggest bad in the RE universe.
residentevil,31hb0z,BustaGrimes1,2,Sun Apr 5 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"RE4 - perfect game imo. I really have no complaints.   RE5 - pretty nice co-op game  RE6 - Pretty bad game overall, but Helenas Ass"

residentevil,31f7b0,REsoleSurvivor1000,3,Sat Apr 4 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"Rev 2 did that pretty well for me, having Leon and Wesker playable. But a dream one would be even better, I could have Leon, Wesker, Piers, ((Battlesuit Jill please?)), Luis AND Ashley.   I would NEVER play any other game in my life."
residentevil,31f7b0,Ryokyon,2,Sat Apr 4 22:29:30 2015 UTC,"I mean you could potential make a great game that pretty much writes itself.  Like the four major modes would be   Outbreak 'Standard Raid mode where you fight for kills and time to rack up a big score as quickly as possible'   Purge 'Clear a stage of a number of enemies'  Overrun  'More standard Horde mode survival, survive waves of enemies till you can escape... or press your luck for big rewards'  and  Operation ' Scenario based missions that are basically a spiritual successor to The Outbreak games'  I mean drawing on all of RE you could have some whacky set ups.  Vector, Leon, Chris and Jake in the Wild things Scenario fighting Zambie animals like Lions, Bears, Crocs and an elephant.  One of my favorite scenario comes from the WildStorm comics where BSAA Agent Mina Gere basically has to survive Zambies and a BoW version of the thing from Deep Rising... on The freaking Space Station."
residentevil,31f7b0,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sun Apr 5 23:30:58 2015 UTC,This. This is what we need.
residentevil,31f7b0,M4Gord,2,Sun Apr 5 23:54:57 2015 UTC,"I think Capcom had the right idea in the Mercenaries 3D to give a minigame it's own fully fledged title.  Would definitely buy a standalone Raid mode game with an impossible large RE cast, would also want Mercenaries in it as well. You could stick with the predecided load outs in Mercs and leave all customisation in Raid,  the only things shared would be characters, animations, enemy and level design.  Throw in a horde mode, some custom options, and pretty much all of what WarGrifter said, and Capcom instantly separates and distills action RE without the burden of a story that fluctuates between action shooter and survival action.  In fact, considering how popular these modes are already I think it's really surprising that Capcom hasn't created a console/PC version already. Guess they're not confident enough that these would sell without a story attached."
residentevil,31g53o,NewJapanGuy,4,Sat Apr 4 19:40:22 2015 UTC,"From what I know it was a success, at least critically. I would imagine financially as well considering what a bargain it is on top of the fact it was critically received. The reason why we aren't seeing those is because for RE2, RE3, and CVX, the games would have to be completely redone as opposed to touched up like REmake was. And that costs $$$. REmake was already hauled over and halfways there as far as acceptable graphics go, so they just had to touch it up to sell it again.    While we (unfortunately) probably won't see any REmasters of RE2, 3 and CVX anytime soon, I think we will eventually. And I strongly believe we will be seeing an RE0 REmaster very soon. Like REmake it only needs to be touched up as opposed to overhauled, and with the rumors of it's existence as well as the rumor of another RE game this year, I think at the least we will see it announced before 2015 is over."
residentevil,31g53o,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:03:34 2015 UTC,"I see, I didn't know that about REmake or even the RE0 news. Thanks for your insight."

That said, it's a great game you shoudnt miss out, just be aware that it won't be like RE6"
residentevil,31eg06,LeviBellington,5,Sat Apr 4 10:15:54 2015 UTC,"As a person who is a die-hard resident evil fan, I can assure you that there is no similarities between Resident Evil REMake (Or directors cut) and RE6. It's a totally different experience between the two games. IF you want a game similar to RE6 but better, play RE4. If you want a brand new experience to the survival horror genre (why I have to say that for RE is stupid) then pick up REmake (REmaster) or directors cut. As you stated in your post that you hate the tank controls which is understandable but if you just try and practice it i'm sure you will get used to it. Just give it a shot"

The early games are a completely different genre; they're survival horror with very little action, the new ones are just action. A lot of people criticize the new ones for this but you can get completely different enjoyment out of both kinds of RE games."
residentevil,31eg06,Gerfndrf,3,Mon Apr 6 10:27:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't played 5 or 6, but from what I can see, they're more like shoot em ups, compared to RE1, which is a strategic, complex game which shows you where the term survival horror came from. Not knowing where your next clip of pistol ammo is coming from and enemies genuinely scaring the shit out of you are what makes it great."

residentevil,31eg06,Retn4,-2,Sat Apr 4 08:08:19 2015 UTC,"Not really. ReMake still has pretty tanky controls albeit a way better atmosphere. I think RE 2 is severely overrated. If you want to get a good balance of the older style, play Code Veronica."
residentevil,31eg06,Matrix117,2,Sat Apr 4 08:21:34 2015 UTC,"You do know that ReMake utilizes ""modern"" movement if you use the control sticks? That might make it more enjoyable if you have a way to do that - I can tell you it worked fine on PC with my controller, and on the PS4 version.  Also, even if you didn't grow up with the series, Rebirth/Remake is an excellent game on its own.  It's worth playing if only to see how it all started, in my opinion.  I think there's the strangest divide among people who play these games. RE6 wasn't shit any more than RE2 is ""overrated"" - 2 offered a lot of improvements over things that plagued 1, aside from tank controls, and it was one of the most content-rich entries in the series, though I suppose 6 was a decently-long game on its own.  All in all, if you're a fan of RE, you might as well play it.  I have yet to really dislike any game in the series so far, though I have played through Operation Raccoon City all of one time, and will probably never touch it again."

It was not a pleasant game though; I would much rather they'd done something with Outbreak than contracted the guys behind a shooter I never enjoyed (SOCOM, and I'm not sure if it's the team behind the old games in that series or just the more recent ones, but I think they got shut down anyway) to make a ""what if"" story.

residentevil,31dueg,CrimsonRex,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:36:42 2015 UTC,This happens to me too. I've not once been able to connect to RE.net. I would also like to know if this affects my ability to join events
residentevil,31dueg,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Sat Apr 4 10:14:52 2015 UTC,"I've seen this happen intermittently during the time I've started playing a couple weeks ago. I'm guessing that it is a server-side issue that will need maintenance, and hopefully, get patched out in a future update.  As of solutions there really aren't any. All we can do is wait and ride out the storm for now."

residentevil,31df0q,darklordoftech,3,Sat Apr 4 00:39:03 2015 UTC,"Nope.   The Family use viruses because they were inspired by Umbrella. They initially purchased biological weapons from Umbrella because Simmons believed they would one day replace conventional weapons. However, their goal was to take over the B.O.W. market from Umbrella instead of relying on illegal collusion. This is why they jumped at the chance to acquire Birkin and the G-Virus."
residentevil,31df0q,News_Bot,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:47:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for replying. I wonder what got Spencer started with wanting to remake the world.
residentevil,31df0q,News_Bot,2,Sat Apr 4 16:24:29 2015 UTC,Play Lost in Nightmares (the DLC for RE5) The files in that bit are pretty enlightening.

residentevil,31cal3,wrathborne,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:38:41 2015 UTC,I did about 700k. And that was only with maxed out masteries for all four equipped weapons.
residentevil,31cal3,jandc86,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:50:41 2015 UTC,Sniper rifle + long range+ fire damage works well.  Anti-tank gun and the same does respectable damage too.
residentevil,31cal3,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sun Apr 5 01:52:06 2015 UTC,I think it's about playing at the right time because I think everyone who plays deals damage to it. I think you get a bloody Gina Outfit if you see it or make it fall?
residentevil,31cal3,surray,2,Fri Apr 3 19:29:56 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that if it does fall then the people that were involved get a skin. I mean it makes sense either way, but it would be sad if was the former."
residentevil,31cal3,Unifizz,2,Sat Apr 4 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"No that's not it, because there's a seperate reward for: ""Enemies defeated: 1 or more"" That's Long Range 6 that everyone involved gets if the event is successful.  ""Witness the enemy's defeat"" must be different.  I assume once it's at very low HP anyone can go in and actually kill it for a while. You're gonna have to be there at the right time."

residentevil,31a849,wrathborne,1 point,Fri Apr 3 08:00:47 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you have to be connected to RE net to play, but I've never been able to get my PS4 to connect even once (no connection problems with anything else. RE.net just won't cooperate)."
residentevil,31a849,John_SteamOS,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:26:53 2015 UTC,did you register your code on their network and link your account?
residentevil,31a849,stabzmcgee,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, and it acknowledges my unlocked medals & whatnot. It just never connects during Raid Mode. According to Gamefaqs (...I know), it looks to be pretty common at the moment."
residentevil,31a849,John_SteamOS,2,Fri Apr 3 23:35:46 2015 UTC,Yeah. System kinda sucks.

residentevil,31a849,stabzmcgee,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:11:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, had mine linked since RE6 came out."
residentevil,31a849,CrimsonRex,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:43:36 2015 UTC,Red came out before revalations 2. You have to link your revelations 2 code with the site.
residentevil,31a849,stabzmcgee,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:19:49 2015 UTC,"I was linked with RE6, RER and even RER2 before today. Judging from what's going on, I can safely say I'm not the only one who's been suddenly de-synced."

residentevil,31a849,iPickled,2,Fri Apr 3 06:23:07 2015 UTC,Can I still do this on Xbox one or am I going to miss out on this? :(
residentevil,31a849,DudeGreen,2,Fri Apr 3 07:10:52 2015 UTC,The update was not there as of last night. Capcom says we Oners should get the update soon. Realm looking forward to it!
residentevil,31a849,iPickled,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:56:03 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain it is across all consoles. I linked the PS4 section just because that is what I was viewing. You should still be good to go either way.
residentevil,31a849,iPickled,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:28:34 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, where do I find this mission?"

residentevil,31a849,stabzmcgee,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:16:12 2015 UTC,It turns out that the event isn't on Xbox yet so that's why I couldn't find it lol

residentevil,31a849,Dagr303,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:51:53 2015 UTC,What is this and how do I do it?
residentevil,31a849,Dagr303,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:55:25 2015 UTC,link your account to the website (its that 10 digit code you got when you first logged in) and then finish creating a profile online. Then you will see it in your raid menues.
residentevil,31a849,CFGX,2,Fri Apr 3 23:12:29 2015 UTC,What account is this that I need to get? Resident Evil.net?

residentevil,31ac9i,willfaptodownvotes,1 point,Fri Apr 3 08:15:11 2015 UTC,Yeah that's definitely a load of shit. I imagine many more cheaters like this will ruin the events Capcom lays out for us just like they did back in the RE6 days. So sad.
residentevil,31ac9i,REsoleSurvivor1000,-1,Fri Apr 3 07:53:29 2015 UTC,"With this shit I've pulled, they're gonna have to manually delete the cheaters again like good old days."
residentevil,31ac9i,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:57:30 2015 UTC,Yeah somehow they manage to slip through. Really hope the mod team stays on their toes for this recent turn of events though.  I don't have too many doubts though. There weren't THAT many people getting through from what I remember (aside from leaderboard/time hackers that is).
residentevil,31b6vq,mrbubbamac,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:11:26 2015 UTC,There will be a patch for the game just like any other

residentevil,315znl,Shera89,5,Sat Apr 4 03:13:53 2015 UTC,That was a fun record to get. Really enjoyable having magnum rounds not kill rotters in one shot.
residentevil,315znl,REsoleSurvivor1000,4,Thu Apr 2 07:21:14 2015 UTC,I had to do it with a maxed out magnum mastery and burst +2 on a python. Ack.
residentevil,31812i,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Thu Apr 2 19:03:11 2015 UTC,Finally! Its about time someone did this. Looking forward to spending hours here. Kudos!

residentevil,317w3l,Dagr303,5,Thu Apr 2 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"Magnums and Snipers are good for most cases, for the Uroboros monsters I like to use a SMG/triple burst handgun with the fire parts."

residentevil,317w3l,HobbieK,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:12:06 2015 UTC,What kind of magnum do you recommend?
residentevil,317w3l,HobbieK,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:23:00 2015 UTC,Whatever gets you the most firepower
residentevil,317w3l,ElSpank,2,Thu Apr 2 23:39:21 2015 UTC,I like Magnums.  There aren't really any best weapons though unless  you consider the broken endgame builds.  As for mods? I like my piercing.   If you mention specific mobs you seem to be having trouble with it will help people advise on techniques.
residentevil,317w3l,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Thu Apr 2 18:34:17 2015 UTC,It's those weird limb things from Barry's campaign. I always go through like 2 mags of assault rifle and pistol ammo on just one of them
residentevil,317w3l,Fatness,2,Thu Apr 2 18:57:31 2015 UTC,Fire Ammo  That's my suggestion. Put it on something like a fast-firing pistol and watch them become crispy critters. Works really well from what I've seen/tried. Also they have only a set amount of weak points so if you shoot for certain locations you can go through the process of elimination to find out where it is on that particular enemy.
residentevil,317w3l,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:05:51 2015 UTC,I only use my handgun and magnum.  If i run out of ammo i have a rifle the old kind and a double barrel shotgun with 3 shots that got charge and tripple burst.   I only use my handgun on them i shot once on each body part untill the orange bubble comes up.  Sometimes i need to double tap each part depends on the damage i do to them.  Like u want to see the part getting damaged like changing shape that is how u know that part isnt the orange bubble.  Or just get smoke grenades run behind them and stab them.
residentevil,317w3l,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"I run the Anaconda (Mag.) with Fire Ammo, Extended Burn, and Recoil or something. I can one shot the limb things sometimes, and usually one mag. shot sets them on fire which toasts off the skin and exposes the orange bulb. From there I can usually one shot the orange bulb with my Samurai Edge. The are honestly the easiest critters next to the basic zombies IMO."
residentevil,317w3l,jandc86,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:51:46 2015 UTC,That's what everyone says but I still have trouble with them and this darn scagdeads

residentevil,315x4v,Dontinquire,3,Fri Apr 3 01:58:40 2015 UTC,It seems like all of the enemies have much more health. The target protection missions are pretty damn hard now

residentevil,312dzy,devon223,6,Wed Apr 1 18:06:00 2015 UTC,All RE6 jokes aside. Pretty sure he means that it's sad resident evil games are now related to a game all about action and shooting.
residentevil,312dzy,fallouthirteen,2,Wed Apr 1 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"Still, the creator of Gears of War said he got a lot of inspiration (especially in the camera area) from RE4 (many people's most loved RE game). The two series sort of evolved off of each other."

residentevil,313bud,ArchieMcFly,7,Wed Apr 1 19:20:36 2015 UTC,I still dislike that Capcom used another voice actress.   I really liked Alyson Court's voice and thought it was fitting for Claire.   It was one of the few consistent things in this franchise!
residentevil,313bud,RinkuTheFirst,7,Wed Apr 1 22:36:18 2015 UTC,"It didn't even feel like I played as Claire. She was the main reason I even got the game, and after hearing that it wasn't the same voice, it killed it for me. I still played of course, but it felt as though it was a different character."
residentevil,313bud,I_Am_Fitz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:02:27 2015 UTC,Holy shit she voiced clair for ALL the games?
residentevil,313bud,tannertundra47,2,Thu Apr 16 04:21:41 2015 UTC,"I was upset about it until I actually played through the game and saw that she was pretty much a completely different character. Personally, I think it's for the best that they brought in a new VA."
residentevil,313bud,LexCrunch,6,Wed Apr 1 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"I still take issue with it.  Even if my personality completely changed, I would still have the same voice.    I do also dislike the way Claire was characterized in Revelations 2."
residentevil,313bud,RinkuTheFirst,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:15:57 2015 UTC,Part of the reason her personality is so different is that it's not Alyson voicing the character. I like to think that she would've come across as a bit sweeter with AC voicing her. Alyson Court understands Claire very well.

residentevil,3161b1,NucIearChrist,2,Thu Apr 2 07:05:02 2015 UTC,"There are a few points, mostly in the very beginning of the game when it forces you to aim down sights for the cinematic effect that it wants, just like in other games where it forces the camera to look at an enormous important thing.  Pay it no mind. Leon's campaign is the worst, and the slow and boring first half hour or so doesn't help matters at all."
residentevil,3161b1,LexCrunch,5,Thu Apr 2 13:49:26 2015 UTC,"I actually Like Leon's campaign the most. It most clearly resembles the rest of Resident Evil, and has some of RE6's few creepy moments."

residentevil,3161b1,LexCrunch,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:24:17 2015 UTC,"Resident Evil 6 does seem to lose itself with the other Resident evil games when it comes to having to solve alot of the puzzles to survive. That was what really got me into the series to begin with. I have been playing them since the 90's and  the last few games they have been becoming more about strategy than having pick up on clues here and there to progress in the story. But with the generations becoming less and less intelligent, maybe they thought it was best to cut them out altogether to build up a new audience for the series."

In that case, I'll see if I can actually Google up an answer...  Yeah, so, it looks like the region to the west of the Ural Mountains is known as European Russia and considered to be part of Europe. According to this article, anyway! There are a bunch of other results, but I think most of them agree that Russia is partially in Europe.  It's quite an interesting issue actually - apparently something like 80% of Russia's population lives in the far west of the country, where the European part would be. So, some consider it a European country which is mostly in Asia! I don't think I'd go that far. A lot of Russians think of themselves as Eurasian, which is probably the easiest answer, but I don't like classifying the continents with Eurasia - it's way too big to be one continent!  I remember finding out Turkey spanned two continents and being like ""whoa I didn't even know that could happen!"" I think it's pretty cool. I kind of wish there were more agreement about continental boundaries, but I guess mostly they don't matter, so people don't care enough to define them consistently.  Anyway, I thought this was kind of fun to learn about, and not stupid! Unnecessary, maybe, but so are lots of interesting things.

They were fun in the sense that it is the older style of gameplay, but there are a lot of things that really turned me off the game. The premise is cool, following a group of survivors during the initial Raccoon City outbreak. But there is no pause for the game, the action continues while you are in your inventory, zombies follow you constantly and there are just no breaks in the gameplay. It just made it unfun to have to run through most of the scenarios and deal with really annoying AI teammates. If they focused on having a single player mode with no partners it would've been a lot better."

It'll bring up your menu option and pause the game. You only get 4 inventory slots per character (unless you're Yoko - she gets 8) so you won't have much to manage at any point. The main thing is choosing what you really need and what you don't need. You can give the AI items too to carry as they'll be following you. Well, each AI interacts with your playable character in different ways. Certain characters like other characters more than others. So usually you'l have one that follows you and then you'll have one that runs off by him/herself to collect items. I wrote up a massive thing about the game because its one of my favorite games of all times if you are interested in reading it.

residentevil,30x8rr,mrbubbamac,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:43:43 2015 UTC,I personally loved that aspect. Since I played when it was online I was usually with 3 other people though and it was enough room for a weapon or 2 plus a heal. I also played Cindy most of the time so I could use all 4 slots for weapon or map objective items and put all the herbs in my herb pouch and have 4 full heals lined up and ready to go and let other teammates carry the first aid sprays.

residentevil,30y1wn,AceninjaNZ,3,Wed Apr 1 01:36:34 2015 UTC,"no survival horror, forced co-op, terrible AI partner, no strafing, quicktime events, terrible conclusion to the original series story arc, none of these were good things."

This is one of the biggest problems with the RE community now, like if it's not what they imagine RE to be they just dismiss it. RE5 is a great game, and it's a great Resident Evil game as well. It's not a great survival horror game, and that's okay, because it obviously wasn't released to be."
residentevil,30y1wn,DoomDash,5,Wed Apr 1 10:48:55 2015 UTC,"As a stand alone game is not bad. I do agree that the AI is bad, and the co-op is not needed, but at the very least if you play it with a friend the game gets really good. If you really have to compare it to the rest of the series, the game still has the cheesy story and for what is worth I think the characters are pretty good and the whole thing is charming (Unlike RE6 were the I don't remember anything from the story), also wesker never ceases me to make me laugh just like in the original. So really the only complain about this game that is unrediemeble is the lack of survival horror, wich started with RE4."

No argument against this, it was terrible.  No strafing. This is what made this game better. Every shot you take should be a decision. You are saying ""this is where I'm taking a stand, it had better be a good one"". That is the tension.  Quicktime events. Yeah I'm no fan, but a huge amount of games have this. They suck for all of those too.  You can't even begin to bring the ""story"" into this, as it's always remained ludicrous to begin with."
residentevil,30y1wn,Pitchswitch,2,Wed Apr 1 01:30:00 2015 UTC,no survival horror: RE4   terrible AI partner: RE4   no strafing: RE4   quicktime events: RE4   So that leaves the forced co-op and story arc. Sure the co-op aspect sucks for single-player but you can't tell me that RE4's story was any good either.  If you bash RE5 yet love RE4 then you should take your nostalgia glasses off and realize what you are saying. Play the games one after the other without bias and you will realize how similar they are.
residentevil,30y1wn,Krusiv,2,Wed Apr 1 11:21:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think comparing Ashley's as an AI partner to Sheva (who is with you for the entire game) is relevant. You're meant to protect Ashley, it makes sense for her to be helpless. Chris/Sheva should be able to take care of themselves and not cause a game over.  I like RE5 but it is nowhere near the standard RE4 set. RE4 was still survival horror, though clearly less than previous games.  My problems with RE5 are: Enemies with assault rifles Cover mechanics Forced co-op Stupid turret sections."
residentevil,30y1wn,realjohnnyfear,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:25:23 2015 UTC,5 had strafing. I mean when you weren't aiming that is.
residentevil,30y1wn,Chupathingy12,-1,Tue Mar 31 22:29:38 2015 UTC,Maybe re5 is a great game if u do not count it as a re game. But now it is an re  and cuz of that it sucks.  They should of done what they did with dmc.  It was from the start a re game but it was so different they made it its own title.  They should of done the same with re5. Fine they changed something with re4 woth third person i think it was a ok change to tryout but i liked the old style more but re4 had atleasr puzzles  and horror feeling in it which re5 dont.  Re5 is way to far away from how re games was from the beginning which automaticly makes  it bad even though the game would be great with  a different title.  That is why i hate it and many people hate it cuz its not how resident evil games should  be like!
residentevil,30y1wn,Fatness,7,Wed Apr 1 09:26:23 2015 UTC,"Resident Evil is a series, there is no reason it should be limited exclusively to survival horror. Even in the world of Resident Evil it wouldn't make sense to have every game be survival horror, because outbreaks happen on a large scale.   That said I believe RE7 should go back to survival horror, but that doesn't mean it NEEDs to be to be good."
residentevil,30y1wn,DoomDash,0,Wed Apr 1 10:50:34 2015 UTC,Ut did not happend on a large scale.  Racoon is the biggest one later small ones from terrorists woth different viruses.  Wouldnt mind if they did but they should go with a side story and not main story as they did.  Kinda like c&c they did renegade that is a fore person shooter game.  But they did not  replace tye rts style with fps style.  Which is the case in re 5. If re5 was a side story game and disnt impact the developement of the normal game style  i wouldnt mind  it.  But atm it replace re genre completly and it sucks for us who like  them.
residentevil,30y1wn,Fatness,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:38:19 2015 UTC,"Yes I think the Revelation series should be co-op games like RE5 or like what RE:R2 was, but the main games should be more like its roots."
residentevil,30y1wn,DoomDash,0,Wed Apr 1 18:25:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry just noticed my spelling was horrible. For my defence i was at work was in a hurry so i typed while i was walking quite fast. But if they wanna make an action re game, make it a side story game, dont ruin the main story game that all old re fans are used to. Like right now there is 0 freaking old re games getting released thats why people hate re5 re6 etc cuz they are not what re games should be like which is what we all got raised with. Thats why we hate them.  Its would be a great action game but its a horrible resident evil game cuz, resident evil game have always been a survival horror puzzle game."
residentevil,30y1wn,Fatness,2,Wed Apr 1 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"I just can't entirely agree with you. I don't see anything wrong with some action RE games. I don't believe that series need to stick to only what they started as. I would be really sad if co-op Resident Evil games no longer existed. What we can agree on is that the series needs to return to survival horror in the main series next. RE7 SHOULD be survival horror, I hope it is, for you and all of the other survival horror purists."
residentevil,30y1wn,DoomDash,0,Wed Apr 1 23:22:56 2015 UTC,"I do love coop games normally but it doesnt fit that well with re games,  might just be my experience though. Or they could have both "" maybe without coop some otherway is open and in coop there is some way that is open.  Like u need help from the other player tp get up a ladder or a door that keeps on shutting on shutting on cuz it have a spring delay etc."" so u can play it alone and later in coop and the game will be abit different.  Kinda like how old re games are like with diff chars.     But i love the old re tank controls which many poeple hate.  But  it made the game scary.  U couldnt see what was infornt of u it was hard to dpdge zombies.  The hs was random ""unless close ups with shotgun"" . but re 0  is coop with tank control and that did work out but i dont think they give it a shot enough  cuz it was a gc only game. And capcom have always sucked at doing ai games.  I always gets annoyed at them.  Wasting ammo or healings or get stuck in stuff etc. Which takes away the whole experience with horror"
residentevil,30y1wn,Fatness,0,Thu Apr 2 03:17:04 2015 UTC,Five in my opinion was the worst Resident Evil by far. I would rather play RE: Survivor on a controller.

residentevil,30mj60,SilentBobVG,2,Sat Mar 28 20:06:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the structure of REV2 is okay, but the Merchant would fit in fine there."
residentevil,30mj60,SilentBobVG,5,Sat Mar 28 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"I would've actually liked to see a merchant type character in Rev 2 instead of the workbench system.   I don't think you could use the RE4 merchant though, that wouldn't make much sense. However, I really think Evgeny could've been the merchant for the game. Since he's always out hunting, stumbling across him in parts of the island would've made sense."
residentevil,30mj60,SilentBobVG,3,Sat Mar 28 21:01:40 2015 UTC,I find the weapons bench to be exceeding boring compared to the money system. Evgeny totally should've been the Merchant!
residentevil,30mj60,SilentBobVG,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:06:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, you're already collecting rare gems for BP, so why not use BP as the currency too? That way you have to choose between using the BP to upgrade perks or to upgrade weapons. Of course, finding weapon upgrades around the island would maybe entitle you to a free upgrade which would be nice.  They definitely missed an opportunity there, but considering how much of revelations 2 is basically just leftover stuff from Revelations 1 I wasn't expecting them to go out of their way to create lots of new things for the game."
residentevil,30mj60,LexCrunch,1 point,Sun Mar 29 09:50:18 2015 UTC,I just don't really care about the skills at all. Maybe three or four of the skills made any noticeable impact to my playing.

residentevil,30mj60,reelbigcasey,0,Sat Mar 28 21:46:48 2015 UTC,"It's crazy similar. The enemies, the combat system, the workbench, the ""old man-little girl"" combo, and Moira is basically a slightly older version Ellie. It's honestly really upsetting, I expected more from Capcom."
residentevil,30mj60,Ttran778,5,Sun Mar 29 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"That's a little unfair.     The enemies are nothing new to the series but are a far cry from clickers. Being able to stealth kill and sneak by enemies by crouching is something that TLOU hardly coined.   The combat system is very different IMO. You can switch at will and make combos because of it. TLOU really didn't have anything unique to it's combat.   The weapons bench was feature in REvelations 1 which came out BEFORE TLOU.   Guarding a little girl again isn't any ground TLOU broke. RE has been doing it since RE2. The only difference is they've made it less of a chore. So Barry happens to be old, he easily could have been someone younger but he's who fans wanted to see again.   Moira is hardly as charming as Ellie but her sailor mouthed teen angst is just a foil for Claire reserved adultness.     And really, you expected ""more"" from Capcom? It's Capcom. I expected less. But they gave us a solid RE game that respectfully does justice to it's characters and fans for an amazing price. You can't really argue with that."

residentevil,30mj60,lkhlkh,3,Sat Mar 28 23:36:53 2015 UTC,To me RE4 was the best in the series. It's nice to have little charm elements. That's what make games unique from each other.

residentevil,30m0ai,BlackPeopleBark,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually loved RE4, its easier to see it's flaws when you see how it led to RE6 and 5, where atmosphere and tension took a backseat to linear level design and gunplay/action. The Evil Within had some levels that felt ripped out of RE4, in a cool way, but felt inconsistent when you are stumbling around a dilapidated hospital with invisible monsters roaming around to taking control of a chaingun on a bus in a city fighting dozens of monsters at a time."
residentevil,30m0ai,chofortu,4,Sat Mar 28 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"I played the demo of Evil Within. Wasn't impressed enough to buy it outright, but I'll pick it up in a sale at some point, probably.  I'm a big fan of the first three or four Silent Hill games. They're quite similar to the old-style RE games.  Dino Crisis is great if you're looking for something similar, too. It is basically Resident Evil 1/2 with dinosaurs. Same developers, too. I haven't played the sequels, though.  I agree with you about Amnesia - it grew quite tedious as it went on.  There have been a few excellent stand-out horror games recently - The Last of Us and Alien: Isolation are two of the best games I've ever played. TLOU is, as a result of its own success, similar to RE:Rev2.  Isolation is kind of like, what if Amnesia was actually interesting? Maybe I'm being unfair (I do love the first couple of Alien films) but it was much more engaging to me despite the similar premises. Plus, you know, RE2 is near enough a remake of Aliens, so there's that link too"
residentevil,30m0ai,chofortu,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"Alien: Isolation looked pretty cool, but I've seen it compared to outlast and amnesia and I kind of felt burnt out on the first person horror games, maybe down the line ill give it a whirl."
residentevil,30m0ai,HobbieK,3,Sat Mar 28 18:00:56 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on Outlast, but Isolation is leagues ahead of Amnesia. Isolation is easily one of the best games I've ever played, whereas Amnesia I would hesitate to even call good.  If you do go for it, be sure to watch Alien (and Aliens if you like) shortly beforehand."

residentevil,30m0ai,HobbieK,1 point,Sat Mar 28 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"I prefer the gameplay in TLOU - the uncommon scarcity of ammunition and resources reminds me of older RE games. RE4 has its own charm, and I do really like the gameplay in that too - the RPG-style weapon building, for example.  But the performances and script for TLOU are just unparalleled in the industry at the moment. I have yet to see anything in another video game come close to the work Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson did."
residentevil,30m0ai,revolta15,-3,Sat Mar 28 18:58:26 2015 UTC,"For story and character, no game beats TLOU. Ever.   I really miss the RPGish stuff from RE4/5. Buying and upgrading guns is way cool than this dumb skill tree thing from REV2"
residentevil,30m0ai,HobbieK,0,Sat Mar 28 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"Haven't played Silent Hill 2. Have played Walking Dead Season 1, and since its basically the same story as TLOU, I have to say TLOU comes out on top. Walking Dead has a GREAT story, but its better in moments, whereas overall TLOU is far more effecting.  And TLOU: Left Behind beats anything in Walking Dead.   That said, I've just started played Walking Dead Season 2, and it is pretty amazing, so maybe it'll give TLOU a run for its money."
residentevil,30m0ai,PyroSpark,2,Sun Mar 29 06:57:29 2015 UTC,"The only other game to truly give me the same feelings of anxiety as RE1 is Metro 2033. I fucking love that game. Sparse ammo, firat person, creepy enviroments, good story, alternate endings, you felt guilty if you played it during the daytimw. It has some minor flaws but it was a game a picked up cheap a few years back, had low expectations, and was blown away with. Every other survival horror game as just meh. Some are fun, none are really scary.  Note I'm a console inferior, so I'm only referring to games that were on consoles."

residentevil,30m0ai,LexCrunch,2,Sat Mar 28 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"About Evil Within, i like the characters and the gameplay, but the game has too many cheap deaths.  Like all Mikami games that i played, the game is way more enjoyable the second time you play. I consider myself big fan of the game, hope we can have EW 2."
residentevil,30m0ai,HobbieK,2,Sat Mar 28 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"Nearly every horror game I've played recently has been the exact opposite of fun. Outlast, Amnesia, Slender, they're all anti-fun drags and I can't believe anyone actually likes them, but whatever.  With few exceptions, I personally really hate the genre.  RE has never been about scares for me, although I adore the disturbed settings and scenarios that it entails, and when it does get the occasional spook in, it's a fun experience. The games are still fun to play and experience, even several times. The control and presentation have for the most part been stunning enough to leave a tenacious impression well after experiencing them, and that's in addition to the consistently solid gameplay. I love how cinematic the old ones are. The way it looks and plays really does feel like being in a B-grade horror movie. And the new ones are some of the best third person shooters I've ever played.  Resident Evil is just a brilliantly crafted series in nearly every respect, even if the story, writing and deliveries range from laughably campy to cringe-worthy awful. Like I said, I'm not in it for the horror at all."

It's the one where you're in a snowstorm, the target is in the middle, and the enemies spawn around you and run across open ground towards the target. Play that on Code Red. There are four chests, all easily accessible right at the beginning. You can check all four and quit if there's no purple or rainbow parts.

I would have, but the 15 euro price tag feels so big, I mean with that same price I could buy 2 games or even just alien isolation. Steam has kinda spoiled a lot people with their low price sales (like me for example) and so paying 15e for few short dlc campaigns that would take about an hour to beat seems way too pricey. And the versus mode is kinda worthless to me, because the only times that mode has been fun is when you play slayers and nobody tries to kill the other players and only kill majinis to get top score. Plus the characters were very unballanced. The whole mode just felt idiotic because you would have to run near an enemy player, stand there and try and shoot them while they run away... Unless they used the bs character with a triplebarrel shotgun or rpg... Looking at you wesker and safari chris."

residentevil,30ivz2,KanjiBE,3,Fri Mar 27 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"I leveled up a few characters as guinea pigs to test or inherit their skills onto others. I'm also using my level 100 Barry to farm level 100 weapons for when I feel like taking on the task of leveling everyone else up to 100.  Once you get all the medals and reach level 100, the other characters are there to make sure you have something to do in raid mode for a while. I seriously doubt most players will want to bother, though, seeing as how they're all so samey."
residentevil,30ivz2,LexCrunch,3,Fri Mar 27 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I finished all the missions with a level 100 HUNK, and now the only things I have left to achieve are a few rewards. One for spending 100 million gold (I'm about 5% of the way there) one for levelling up all the skills for one character (I did that with Cipher but it apparently didn't count so I guess it really means all the skills so I'm probably about 5% of the way there too) and then a bunch of rewards for getting everyone to levels 10 and 50.  So I'll probably just do the daily missions with the other characters till they're all level 50, then use HUNK to get the level-up-all-skills reward.  Maybe the RE.net online events will spice things up!"
residentevil,30ivz2,chofortu,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"Best thing to do, if you really want to level up more than one character is to co-op boost them in one player.     Start a co-op mode with a second controller. Select the character you want to boost on the second pad.  Use your high level character as main. Play the highest level of 4-4 available (I do it in Code Red).  Just complete that level with your main.  Don't worry if your scrub dies; you still get the xp.  You can boost a lvl. 1 character to 50 in about 1-2 hours.   It's worth levelling other characters so you can inherit their unique skills on your main.

The actual mode itself isn't canon.  Here's the interview.   ・I heard the boss who gives money in The Mercenaries is someone involved with Umbrella, but please tell us about him in detail.  Kawamura: Let's reveal the truth behind the The Mercenaries scene. As a matter of fact, The Mercenaries is a popular entertainment program of the underworld that only very few aristocrats, high-ranking government officials and the super-wealthy can watch in a secret members-only Pay-Per-View (paid program broadcast) televised by Umbrella. The mystery man who gives the mercenaries instructions and a reward is the host and producer of the program. The state of the mercenaries is broadcast live by satellite with a high-performance microphone attached to the mercenaries, installed by the Monitors. The time displayed on-screen is a time display broadcast to the mercenaries and the audience's approval rating (viewership) is added to it in real time. If the mercenary fights heroically, extravagantly defeats enemies and impressively rescues civilians and comrades, airtime will be extended if they gracefully escape from the crisis. If they garner support well and reach the goal within the airtime, they are given a reward depending on the audience rating and the mercenary will be freed. Mercenaries who can't earn the audience's approval rating have their camera cut off upon timeout and lose their life at the same time."

residentevil,30ebhv,HeDontUseWASD,3,Thu Mar 26 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"The DLC is too much money.  Bought it 3 times. Once for me, and for 2 friends. I'm not kidding."

residentevil,30ebhv,darklink34,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:34:47 2015 UTC,Isn't gold edition on sale for the next few days on steam? I thought it included this.
residentevil,30gbz8,Ghostspider1989,18,Fri Mar 27 03:15:58 2015 UTC,They just snort a line of it.
residentevil,30gbz8,Solid_Panda,16,Fri Mar 27 03:59:53 2015 UTC,"There never was an Alpha team to rescue or a Wesker, Jill, Barry & Chris just got so stoned in the forest one night till they wound up in a mansion, Where throughout half the trip of escaping ''Monsters'' Barry has momentary hallucinations of Jill dressed as a sandwhich....We don't know where Chris is"
residentevil,30gbz8,Luverovlotz,6,Fri Mar 27 09:06:03 2015 UTC,I always assumed they worked like a patch or something.
residentevil,30gbz8,LexCrunch,5,Fri Mar 27 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's almost impossible for an orally-administered medicine to take effect so quickly, so yeah, they must rub it into the wounds.  Maybe it's like in Revelations 2 - they get distilled into a spray (off-screen).  I do like that they keep changing how it works. ""It's a spray! No, a pill! No, a spray!"""

residentevil,30gbz8,SeparateWay,4,Fri Mar 27 08:57:45 2015 UTC,They smoked them like pot.
residentevil,30gbz8,R3TR1X,2,Fri Mar 27 04:56:41 2015 UTC,"They are first aid so it would make sense to me if they were used directly on the wound, like the first aid spray. I doubt they smoke them, because characters can still use them without a lighter."
residentevil,30gbz8,luslanz,2,Fri Mar 27 10:03:34 2015 UTC,I always assumed it was smoked. I mean it's loud out in a paper that can only be assumed as weed paper.
residentevil,30gbz8,EQUASHNZRKUL,3,Sat Mar 28 08:18:12 2015 UTC,given that they were ground up and put on paper. I can say they were most likely smoked. mostly because I want someone with more talent than me to make a picture of Claire lighting up with dead zombies lying around.
residentevil,30g2rp,compared_rook,6,Fri Mar 27 01:56:35 2015 UTC,"I was going to say REmake, because I do think that it's the better game, on balance. But I think solely on the merit that Revelations 2 is so new, and therefore will have a very active multiplayer community (and RE.net events and so on) for the next few weeks, you should take this opportunity to buy and play it now. REmake will still be the same game a year or two from now."
residentevil,30g2rp,chofortu,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:05:39 2015 UTC,Ya I was thinking that as well.
residentevil,30g2rp,turboS2000,4,Fri Mar 27 03:08:21 2015 UTC,Revelations 2. the raid mode is just too addictive!
residentevil,30g2rp,LexCrunch,5,Fri Mar 27 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"both are are very good, but the remake of re1 is perfect, and is 100% scarier, light off, volume up, great times"
residentevil,30g2rp,ian356094,3,Fri Mar 27 17:12:51 2015 UTC,"Revelations 2 will have online multiplayer in its raid mode by Tuesday, so I'd recommend going for that to keep your attention while saving up for and well after your second purchase."

residentevil,30g2rp,Rae2014,5,Fri Mar 27 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"Well, the remake is definitely not as action packed as revelations 2.  It's pretty much just old school RE.  If I where you, I would go with revelations 2, since you're more used to that control scheme and gameplay.  RE1 is a classic for sure, but for those that never got into it, it can be hard to get into now since the gameplay is just so old school."
residentevil,30g2rp,icebear518,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:04:57 2015 UTC,I've beaten Dino Crisis when i was younger so i think i would no problem with the tank controls but I know what you mean plus I've heard good things about Revelation 2 so I think I'm going to pick it up and play it with a friend.
residentevil,30g2rp,ScubaStevo99,2,Fri Mar 27 02:54:10 2015 UTC,Yeah Revelations is much funner when played co op as well.
residentevil,30g2rp,EQUASHNZRKUL,4,Fri Mar 27 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"I would start where it all began, entering the world of survival horror"

residentevil,30g2rp,EQUASHNZRKUL,2,Fri Mar 27 02:23:57 2015 UTC,I understand it kinda reminds me of how Fallout the hardcore rpg got turned into a TES game with guns. I can see how a fan would hate the change of genre.
residentevil,30g2rp,ScubaStevo99,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:54:34 2015 UTC,You could buy just episode 1 to try it out. I was in your shoes awhile back and bout the REmake as well as episode 1 and I enjoy both. Both games are very entertaining.

residentevil,30fh3b,LexCrunch,2,Thu Mar 26 22:58:02 2015 UTC,Never mind. Capcom customer support just put up an announcement about an upcoming tool to be released at an unspecified date and time that will do the job.

residentevil,30d965,crimsonstare,6,Thu Mar 26 13:28:24 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I've played Revelations, so I had to look up the video of that fight. I agree with you though, that fight was very difficult."
residentevil,30d965,realjohnnyfear,4,Thu Mar 26 13:32:00 2015 UTC,I really lost my cool with that fight. I very rarely die on RE bosses but I just kept falling short. Had to take a break to calm down and finally won by not trying to inflict any damage and just being really careful.
residentevil,30d965,0beseninja,3,Thu Mar 26 16:56:29 2015 UTC,Same. I've never been as mad during a resident evil as with that fight. Usually I don't get that mad because I'm the one Fucking up. But that fight had a lot of bullshit in it.

residentevil,30d965,btbcorno,7,Thu Mar 26 13:42:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. Think you can do it with those 20 pistol bullets you saved? You thought wrong. I had to start again.
residentevil,30d965,LXG_Doge-Fanboy,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:36:00 2015 UTC,it hapened to me twice. First I didn't have enough ammo to beat Tyrant. Restart. Then I didn't have enough health to run away from steve. Restart. It was years before I attempted run 3.

I don't know the name of the monster, the one where the vision is almost FPS and he throws things at you. I think i died almost 40 times to kill him."
residentevil,30d965,Web3d,6,Thu Mar 26 14:41:00 2015 UTC,That was a tough one but totally worth it. RE5 is probably the most impressive platinum I own.

Then they added the PvP dlc and that removed the game as it was no longer 100% achievements.  As someone who has no desire to pvp in RE i was PISSED."
residentevil,30d965,nastynate66,2,Thu Mar 26 16:58:23 2015 UTC,The same fucking thing happened on RE6. I have both plat for RE5 and 6 but both are not 100% because of the DLC trophies. REally annoying.

residentevil,30bdaw,Zaeh,4,Thu Mar 26 20:02:26 2015 UTC,"Capcom has always ridiculous projections. RE 6 did became their third-best selling game (if I'm remembering that right), and sold 6.1 million, which is far from poor, unless you're GTA or Call of Duty."
residentevil,30bdaw,The_Naked_Snake,0,Thu Mar 26 20:25:23 2015 UTC,And two of those three were awful IMO lol. I'd like to say so far we've gotten two good RE games this year.
residentevil,30bdaw,thatoneguy721,2,Thu Mar 26 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"True, but I don't really consider the ReRemake a new game. It is mostly just a port. I didn't consider the HD releases of the Chronicles games, Code:Veronica X, or 4 to be new games, or any of the other of dozens of RE ports. We've really only got one game this year so far. One new one at least."
residentevil,30bdaw,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:33:58 2015 UTC,Well then I guess we got 2 in 2013 as well lol

residentevil,30bdaw,Philbrowski,2,Thu Mar 26 12:58:41 2015 UTC,You think this time it'll actually be survival horror? As opposed to the action shooters they've been releasing? Thank god they remastered the first game.
residentevil,30bdaw,mrbubbamac,2,Thu Mar 26 05:41:22 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. Every time they say they'll go back to the roots of the series, and every time it doesn't happen. That's what we were told for RE6, RE: Rev and Rev 2. Now I actually enjoy the Revelations games a lot but they are still a far cry from the feel of the originals."
residentevil,30bdaw,Zaeh,2,Thu Mar 26 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"They've never really said it straight out like that. They've only said that those games (and in the context of RE 6, Leon's campaign) were more akin to the older games. Not that they're going straight out back to the roots."
residentevil,30bdaw,Philbrowski,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:22:40 2015 UTC,I wish they wouldn't have scrapped the original Resident Evil 4. It looked like it was going to be amazing.

residentevil,30bdaw,Steinuh,0,Thu Mar 26 06:48:16 2015 UTC,I hope theres a simultaneous release on PC since RE6 took a good while to be ported.

residentevil,30bdaw,EQUASHNZRKUL,0,Thu Mar 26 03:57:08 2015 UTC,For all we know the new game could just be revelations 3 or gaiden 2
residentevil,30bdaw,omeganemesis28,2,Thu Mar 26 03:58:44 2015 UTC,Idk about a Rev 3 so soon.
residentevil,30bdaw,AnimaOnline,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:59:14 2015 UTC,There's been some speculation of perhaps a Rev 2 Season 2. If something really is coming later this year then I definitely can't see it being Resi 7. More likely to be something smaller such as a continuation of Rev 2 or maybe Resi 0 HD Remaster.
residentevil,30bdaw,omeganemesis28,2,Thu Mar 26 13:03:48 2015 UTC,I'd pay good money for the Re0 HD. I bought and played the hell out of both the PC and ps4 versions of 1. So either that or 7 would be fine by me.   I think I need a little break from Revelations gameplay.
residentevil,30bdaw,Zaeh,2,Thu Mar 26 13:06:50 2015 UTC,"RE 0 HD is pretty much all but confirmed at this point, and I'd be really surprised if (given that this 'leak' is real) the RE game was anything else."
residentevil,30bdaw,CyberneticCuntSmashr,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:29:58 2015 UTC,"There's been some speculation of perhaps a Rev 2 Season 2.   Where.

residentevil,30bdaw,Zaeh,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"There was fan speculation here on the subreddit, that's about it. But even he words it as 'speculation', instead of rumors or leaks."

residentevil,309hmi,HobbieK,11,Wed Mar 25 15:52:51 2015 UTC,Worth no more than $5. It's very poorly made.
residentevil,309hmi,News_Bot,14,Wed Mar 25 21:57:30 2015 UTC,Definitely not at $30. Wait for a sale if you must play it.
residentevil,309hmi,NoozleontheHoose,9,Wed Mar 25 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"I thought it had really great potential. Running around Raccoon City, gunning down zombies in a GoW style game? Sounds pretty fantastic to me. Bought it used at GameStop for $5... Still pretty bummed out I didn't spend the $5 on something better. So many bugs that it almost makes the game unplayable. If you can get through that, the gameplay isn't TOO terrible. You might even get some fun out of it for a while if you really push yourself to play it.  Overall, I wouldn't spend anything more than the $5 I already spent. If you're considering spending $30, save your money."
residentevil,309hmi,TonyDanzuh,4,Wed Mar 25 16:52:00 2015 UTC,"Glitchy, broken mess."
residentevil,309hmi,ShadowLeggy,7,Thu Mar 26 06:05:32 2015 UTC,"If the thought of playing Gears of War in Raccoon City sounds appealing to you, then you might enjoy it a hell of a lot more than I did.  It's still a broken mess riddled with bugs that you might just finish in an afternoon if you don't grow bored of it first. If you wrestle with GFWL to get some multiplayer going, it's a little more fun, but not nearly fun enough to warrant the price tag."
residentevil,309hmi,LexCrunch,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:06:09 2015 UTC,The first scene in the whole game has you running toward the screen.   Let's just say either I can't even or I can't even can't and died like 6 times trying to get that scene to work.  Gfwl died so I don't know if online PC works? Or did that move over to steam?
residentevil,309hmi,omeganemesis28,7,Thu Mar 26 13:01:03 2015 UTC,"Gameplay wise, I enjoyed it. The story is hit or miss and the ending was lackluster. I loved the multiplayer, they really did it right but I don't know whether or not there is an active community."
residentevil,309hmi,soliddewitt,3,Wed Mar 25 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"I consider it a 3rd person RE take on Left 4 Dead. The game is fun, but really only if you buy the DLC missions. It is a cool game. Just remember it isn't canon to the timeline.  I enjoyed it immensely.  I maxed out all the characters and weapons. So, I put a good chunk of time into it. Some levels are really fun replaying. Some are a bit tedious. Overall I say buy it,  but wait for a sale or if you have another console buy it used. I saw it for like $15 on ps3. Worth that much I'd say."
residentevil,309hmi,thatoneguy721,5,Wed Mar 25 17:49:46 2015 UTC,It is not worth anywhere near $30.
residentevil,309hmi,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have paid $5 if I knew what I was getting. Maybe it's been patched, haven't played since release, but even without loads of bugs and glitches it's a steaming pile of nothing interesting at all. Without a doubt it's the worst resident evil game."

Was it difficult? Yes. Could some of it had been done better? Yes. The thing is that it's a new take on RE and people don't like too far outside of their comfort zone. Personally, I enjoyed it because I was open-minded to it. Playing on the other side of the spectrum was a lot of fun to me."

Unrelated to this game in particular, but I recently picked up Mercenaries 3D and as soon as I saw the dual-chainsaw dude I almost shit myself. That noise is never good news..."
residentevil,307z2m,REsoleSurvivor1000,5,Wed Mar 25 05:18:05 2015 UTC,"It's dumb, I know, but I'm irked that the chainsaw and other buzzing power tools have apparently become a series staple as a mini-boss weapon since #4. The tension it built worked really well, but it only worked the first time when it was a one-hit-kill weapon attached to a more relentless enemy. Now the chainsaw / buzz-saw enemies just have one move in their repertoire that can kill you instantly and are prone to taking breaks and being slow overall anyway.  Call me a sourpuss, but it's like, if you won't show the body mutilation anymore that the weapon ought to deliver, then don't even bother. The effect is gone."
residentevil,307z2m,LexCrunch,4,Wed Mar 25 05:57:08 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I'm not a fan of the saw enemies in RE:V1 and 6, but I liked it and the Giant Axe guy in RE5, and I think the Barry fight with the drill boss is fun and tense, if a little annoying."
residentevil,307z2m,HobbieK,2,Wed Mar 25 07:58:36 2015 UTC,"The executioner in 5 was actually really good, but there were chainsaw Majini who were just slow and sucky bullet sponges. To be fair, they are pretty fearsome if you don't remember to blast them when they get to standing up again.  As for the Barry fight, it's not so bad if you just use Natalia to find his weak spots. Still, I prefer to slam Pedro with bullets as Claire so Barry doesn't have to fight him at all. Makes the chapter go much faster."

residentevil,3057kw,MrRom92,2,Tue Mar 24 16:09:22 2015 UTC,"Close to nonexistent. None of them were really close to completion at all. The Castle version had it's story written for the most part, but aside from that, they were all scrapped fairly early into development, for various reasons.  I'd imagine those early versions only existed internally at Capcom and are probably completely gone at this point."
residentevil,3057kw,Zaeh,2,Tue Mar 24 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"What are the odds we'll ever get to play those early versions of the game, which to my knowledge were actually fairly close to completion?   Odds are slim to none. Those were further from completion than RE 1.5, and that was somewhere around 80%. Best guess is the ones we saw were 30-40%. I don't even think they had playable versions at E3. They had a version that turned into DMC. I think the 'Fog' version was just a concept trailer with no actually gameplay. The 'Hookman' was next, and that had pre-recorded gameplay of a few rooms and a hallway, but didn't have a demo disc or anything playable at the expos (to my knowledge). Then they had some other versions that the public never saw (the one about the girl and the dog), that probably only existed as concept art.  I'm betting any of the remaining files for the beta versions, are all locked away somewhere and we'll never see them. Especially since the leak of the 1.5 game files. I'm betting that caused some new internal procedures where Capcom will prevent things like that happening again."
residentevil,3057kw,CyberneticCuntSmashr,2,Tue Mar 24 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly from Kawamura's interviews, the Castle (or Fog) version was the one closest to being completed (although still probably didn't make it even half-way through development), but it was scrapped due to being too expensive to make. The girl and the dog (that eventually went to another Capcom game which name I can't remember) came from the Castle version as well.  The 'Hookman' thing that followed wasn't an actual build of the game, but rather just a gameplay test done with the assets of the previous scrapped version (the Castle/Fog one). They made multiple similar 'tests' in order to find interesting gameplay aspects, but the Hookman was the only one we saw video of. This as the one that was deemed too supernatural (which was one of the reasons why it was scrapped), but I don't think Kawamura, who was the man behind it, thought too highly about it anyway. Apparently the hookman/painting thing was copy-pasted from some movie or something?  There are various interviews by the fan community with him where he talks about the development of those versions in detail, I'll find and link them when I get home from work. Interesting stuff, and such a shame that none of the versions never saw the light of day.  To add to that, the interviews I read where by Project Umbrella (I think), but everything's blocked at work so can't do better at the moment."
residentevil,3057kw,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:27:04 2015 UTC,"You could be right. All of the reports have different details depending on who was interviewed, and at what time. The fog version was something I never saw past just demo footage. I remember reading they threw that in the trash at about 50% completion, but who knows if that's accurate or not. This was (I think) their second version. This came after the version that they eventually spun into DMC.  The version of the Hookman was a completely different thing from what I had read. This was the version that took place in a haunted house, with creepy dolls and the hook apparition that pursued Leon. Maybe you read something else. Again, depending on what you read, you get some people saying ""This was this"" when it really wasn't.  The girl and the dog version was the next one that was supposed to take place in some tower, or castle, with a lab underneath. That spun into Haunting Ground after they realized it wouldn't work.  At some point they did toss around the idea for traditional zombies, but they canned that as well. Eventually they just took a little of this version, and a little of that version, and started with a new course, which gave us Resident Evil 4 as we know it today.  Capcom is hilarious. Their studios have almost made a tradition of developing Resident Evil games and then throwing them away. Dudes need to get their shit together."
residentevil,3057kw,CyberneticCuntSmashr,2,Tue Mar 24 18:58:15 2015 UTC,"There's a fairly small amount of video of any of the versions. The Castle/Fog one had the ""cradle of the Progenitor"" trailers. It's the first one we saw footage of and yeah, the second version under the RE 4 title, after the one that more or less became Devil May Cry as is (which was after the ""original"" RE 3 with HUNK on a cruise ship changed platforms and re-titled to RE 4).  The Hookman test had very little planned around it, and they were just demoing some neat gameplay ideas. Apparently they went trial and error with a lot more of them, but the Hookman was the only one we ever saw.  Yeah, Haunting Ground, that was it. The girl and dog where in the Castle/Fog version which was the one after DMC. They weren't even the only things in that version that were re-purposed for Haunting Ground, some environments seen in the aforementioned 'cradle of the Progenitor' trailer were pretty much copy-pasted to the game.  The 'Umbrella takedown' version had the zombies (and I'd assume more traditional gameplay), but it was deemed too formulaic and generic so it had to go.  I agree on them having quite a few problems with their development culture (at least back then), but you have to remember that there was stuff like them scrapping RE 1.5 as well, which resulted in a superior game arguably in every way."
residentevil,3057kw,Zaeh,2,Tue Mar 24 20:45:17 2015 UTC,I haven't heard of HUNK on a cruise ship. Did that become Dead Aim or something?
residentevil,3057kw,mrbubbamac,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:42:38 2015 UTC,"It was a game called Biohazard 3, which would've worked as a sequel to 2 with the aforementioned scenario. But they decided to name a side story with Jill and Nemesis ""Resident Evil 3"" instead, and the HUNK game got switched to the PS2 and titled RE 4, and Capcom decided to go with a different scenario as well, starting the troubled development of RE 4.  I don't know for sure, but it's very likely that whatever they had made of the HUNK game got re-purposed to Dead Aim, mainly the setting."
residentevil,3057kw,Zaeh,2,Wed Mar 25 01:44:30 2015 UTC,I can confirm that GS4/Dead Aim was based on that scrapped HUNK scenario. There was talk about it from CAPCOM when the game was announced. Written by Noboru Sugimura also.  It was meant to feature human-plant hybrid Zombies instead of normal Zombies and the story focused on HUNK bringing the G-Virus to Umbrella. Not much else apart from that.

It's too bad that's not somewhere out there. It might've made a poor sequel, but I still would've liked to see what that looked like.  And I agree about making a superior product out of 1.5. It's not that I don't think they should produce a refined product...quite the opposite. I just think it's corny that they've frequently announced a game and changed it drastically or trashed it."

The game is a spin-off of the Clock Tower series, featuring many gameplay similarities with Clock Tower 3.   The game follows Fiona Belli, a young girl who the player must guide through Belli Castle and its immediate environments in an effort to escape. Along the way, players must solve puzzles, unlock doors and evade, hide or attempt to fight against the castle's inhabitants. Fiona is accompanied by Hewie, a White Shepherd and the two must work as a team to solve certain puzzles and outwit their pursuers.

I must look into that.  I've been a fan of the series pretty much since the beginning, re2 was the first game that scared the bejeezus out of me as a kid and yet left me wanting more at the same time. I got hooked, and when 4 came out it was nothing short of revolutionary. Instantly became one of my all time favorites. There are very few games I hold in such high regard and so I'm hoping that someday we can experience more of the ""behind the scenes"" stuff involved in it's creation, officially or not. Even if we could just play test rooms or dig around through files to look for unused assets. It would be so awesome. One can always dream..."
residentevil,3057kw,CyberneticCuntSmashr,2,Wed Mar 25 01:03:00 2015 UTC,I'm not sure there is anything out there other than information about the girl and dog version. Any of the work they had just rolled into the Haunting Ground game.  Another cool one to check out is the other version of the sequel to Resident Evil. There is almost nothing about it on the internet other than a few concept drawings. It was supposed to be about returning to the mansion after it exploded and being able to explore some of the ruins and more labs underneath the area. It got scrapped but sounded kind of cool.
residentevil,3057kw,News_Bot,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:29:46 2015 UTC,"The Castle/Fog version's scenario was complete. However, the game was roughly only 40% complete when it was scrapped and had many problems.  The GameCube could not handle it. That trailer scene with the curtains blowing in the wind used up all of the console's RAM, for instance. They couldn't get any enemies into the game as a result, so they experimented with having one enemy the entire game. They didn't like the result and it was too expensive to address the problems."

Inherit what you want from him and put off leveling him up any further until you have all the skills you want from other characters already inherited.  The sword is good if you also maximize Melee Master, but you really really don't want to have to rely on it alone. By the time you reach Very Hard gauntlets, half the enemies will explode in your face, and you won't have enough ammo on hand to fight them from a safe distance. Make sure you have a sizable investment in a weapon mastery or two before dumping points into your melee."

residentevil,3028fb,ThePrinceMagus,7,Mon Mar 23 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"This game is a low-budget endeavour, and that's reflected in the fact that (I think) all the Raid mode characters either already existed in the campaign, or had their models taken from previous games in the series.  ...Or were Cipher.

residentevil,3028fb,chofortu,2,Mon Mar 23 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"I understand everything being done on a budget, but that's the magic of DLC. They can give us some characters who weren't made on such constraints. Fingers crossed."

Last time a little girl had a seemingly inactive virus they still decided to torture the crap out of her and then stuff her into the DSO."

residentevil,3002vh,News_Bot,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:23:11 2015 UTC,I really don't think they were trying to make her sound cool. I mean I could show her to my 10 - 19 nephews/nieces and I don't think they would consider her as cool. I think they were just trying to set her apart from other sidekicks we've gotten up til now. Either that or they watched too much Dexter and they were trying to copy Debra Morgan. They have similar style of over the top cursing.

residentevil,3002vh,Krusiv,2,Sun Mar 29 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd hate Natalia, but I liked both characters by the end. Natalia gave both the villain and the protagonist (Barry) added motivation (the influence from The Last of Us here is so obvious but so welcome), and Moira managed to go from that sort of ""woman in a box"" storyline we always hear being criticized these days, to a strong and admirable character. I know this may sound overstated, but right now RE:R2 is my favorite game in the series. Claire is also an admirable and strong female character, and Barry is the most engaging protagonist the RE games have ever seen."

As much as I like Claire, I feel as if they put her on the back burner in terms of character development, but that's okay 'cause it gave the other 3 room to distinguish themselves.   I really hope to see from Moira and Natalia again, I just hope the latter can be saved."

residentevil,301k5i,News_Bot,2,Wed Mar 25 14:41:33 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it overall. It was nice to see Claire and Leon back together. Great animation, decent action scenes, and it didn't drag on like Damnation."
residentevil,301k5i,Ttran778,2,Mon Mar 23 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"Degeneration was really awful I thought. From a story perspective it had something mildly interesting...but script wise it was really awful. Putting Claire and Leon back together is always a good idea, except when you make the story mostly about oblivious SWAT lady and her terrorist brother. Claire stopped having anything to do with the story for the most part after the 40 minute mark except when she was with the Tricell guy.  They had nice animation and some good one liners, but it was a hollow empty CGI film. They have the technology to make their own RE films, but they don't have the talent to write a script thats serious enough. Yeah, RE has always been about cheesiness and stuff,and you can have that still in the script, but how about character development and maturity to back up it up when things have to get serious?  I'll be honest, its infinitely better than anything Anderson has ever made in his career as a copy and paste director. But thats still doesn't say much about it.  I dont know much about Japanese screenwriting(though I do know fair amount about Japanese story telling) but I know a decent amount about Western screenwriting and the formula this film had was incredibly flat and uninteresting.  The characters don't seem to have any character flaws, emotional voids, the shit that makes us connect with them as an audience. Leon and Claire are simply not human characters in this film, the only flaws they have is a weakness to plot devices. If I didn't play the games, I wouldn't know anything about them when watching the film.   Yet even as someone who does play the games this film told me nothing about them that I didn't know beyond Claire working for Terrsave(adn she survived raccoon city) and Leon with the government. I don't anything about them emotionally, or who they are as people, outside of their jobs.  RE will never grow up with scripts like this, and I think its tried to these past 11 years...but being that the characters lack flaws or voids will always keep us from connecting with them as people."
residentevil,301k5i,wrathborne,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:44:32 2015 UTC,I think you nailed it. There's not enough exposition with the main characters and too much with the one off characters for the movie

If you mean the one in Russia, I didn't like that at all.  The lickers were really underwhelming and people being able to control them was really confusing and I don't think they ever actually explained it. Also that russian america fanboy was fucking annoying."
residentevil,301k5i,BearpunchGunsmoke,2,Mon Mar 23 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"The lickers had slave Plagas and Buddy had the Master Plaga, that's how he could control them, similarly to how the Ganados etc. work.   Not really confusing, it's explained in the film. Although Damnation did try its best to keep it ambiguous to whether the townsfolk were infected with type-1 or type-2."
residentevil,301k5i,Zaeh,1 point,Tue Mar 24 09:45:34 2015 UTC,"I guess I missed that part.  I remember watching it the wee hours of the morning.  I still think that humans controlling lickers is very stupid, however."

residentevil,301k5i,Muugle,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:18:54 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that is very stupid.  But RE4 has a notoriously silly plot that I can't really defend anyway.  But it's oodles of fun and doesn't overload you with cheese.  Mind you, the lickers being controlled wasn't the worst part of the movie I thought. Just dumb and poorly implemented."
residentevil,301k5i,BearpunchGunsmoke,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:44:39 2015 UTC,I mean... The general idea behind most of REs plot is controlling BOWs to do combat and selling them to the highest bidders. Its why they exist in the first place :p  But I agree that it was uses quite cheesy in the movie. Just seemed weirdly done.
residentevil,301k5i,omeganemesis28,2,Thu Mar 26 13:12:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I understand the desire for control of BOWs and all that.  But it just seemed really out of place.  I don't know.  Maybe if they were controlling regular zomies I wouldn't have helplessly giggled so much during the movie.  Lickers are just kind of hilarious when they act like someones dog.

residentevil,2zyrtr,chofortu,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:33:31 2015 UTC,"""Very powerful in close range"" refers to shotguns in general, and how they are more powerful and accurate at close range.  ""Long range use only"" refers to the [Long Range+] perk thing, which can apply to any weapon. It makes more sense on a handgun or a sniper rifle, for example, but here I guess it just means that if you do choose to use this shotgun on distant enemies, it will work better than an equivalent shotgun without this perk."

Some people in this thread mention the lack of replayability unless you're going for speed runs, but from experience I can say that this game is great to go back to, as long as you give it some time between playing. I replay this more than any other single player game outside of the megaman and castlevania games, but those are short burst games, RE is more of an investment. Don't be surprised if you come back to it 6 months or a year from now and have just as much fun. And don't be surprised if you do that for te next ten years. Great game, I'm glad you get it."

And it was the first game I got my SO to sit down and play with me.  I am really hoping for a remake of RE0, maybe even of RE 2 and 3.  They just don't make games like that anymore.

residentevil,2zy9dc,jaggular,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:02:50 2015 UTC,I'm less interested in who it will be about and more in what it will be about.

residentevil,2zy9dc,CyberneticCuntSmashr,-1,Mon Mar 23 19:51:39 2015 UTC,"Go back and play Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil 6,  thats when the series story arc fell apart and its not getting any better. Or do you think RE7 is going to be the game that puts the series back on track storywise and horror wise?  Even with improvements like Revelations 2, in the long run will most likely be a bandage on a freshly missing limb.  Games 1-code V the series story is the strongest and going back to the original story arc with more recent gameplay mechanics, full 3d worlds to explore is the only way to actually save this series from turning into a bigger mess than it is now.  For 11 years now the series has floundered. Even with the updated combat system that RE4 introduced, which was a blast, the stories chosen for the main games for the last 11 years have been awful.  RE is 19 years old now, how bad is it that more than half of it  is god awful(its always been cheesy B movie fun, but the last 11 years its been z-grade shit)? Yeah it still sells because its brand name but how many more of these awful games are you going to support and defend before you come to the same conclusion I have?  Watching something I grew up loving turn into garbage isn't fun. Now that theres a dev team thats showing some competence I think its time this mess of the story was ended and everything started over, with this dev team in charge."
residentevil,2zy9dc,wrathborne,0,Mon Mar 23 20:09:10 2015 UTC,"Hold on a minute. When did I say anything about Resident Evil 4, 5, or 6? I didn't make any predictions or judgements about the storyline.  You said you wanted to go back and remake the first Resident Evil...again...which was produced in '96, then remade and rereleased in '02, then that was upscaled and rereleased this year...and now you want to go back and redo that shit again? That's what I was asking about.   For 11 years now the series has floundered. Even with the updated combat system that RE4 introduced, which was a blast, the stories chosen for the main games for the last 11 years have been awful.   I don't disagree with that, but at the same time, that's not at all what I was asking about.   Now that theres a dev team thats showing some competence I think its time this mess of the story was ended and everything started over, with this dev team in charge.   Again, so because there is a different team involved, you want to go back to Arklay? Why? If you're insistent on a reboot, why not just reboot all together with a new start, instead of rebooting a remake of an original?"
residentevil,2zy9dc,CyberneticCuntSmashr,0,Mon Mar 23 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"why not just reboot all together with a new start  Arklay mansion is kind of the start of the series(Zero was boring as hell) to the player and honestly the setting is still one of the strongest in the games 20 year history.  Starting over with new characters wouldn't be a bad idea, but the fact is they'd have to hold up with the original protagonists and antagonists.  Capcoms dev teams have been pretty hit and miss with their RE characters the past 11 years.   Moira, Natalia, Alex etc have been pretty good(infinitely better than Jake, Carla, Simmons, Excella, Salazar, Saddler IMO) but its hard to not revisit the Chris, Jill, Barry, Wesker dynamic.  Going back to a full 3d Arklay mansion to explore is something I've wanted for over 15 years.  Eventually it probably will happen, but the sooner it does the better."
residentevil,2zy9dc,wrathborne,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:40:31 2015 UTC,"I think a more personal story focusing on developing the characters on a smaller scale threat would be a good direction to go in. I really enjoyed Revelations, which seemed to be focused in that direction.  If anything, I think they need to retire Leon and Chris for a game and focus on just about anyone else. Moira and Jake and Sherry  EDIT  Or maybe even a full on prequel or complete time jump."
residentevil,2zy9dc,iPickled,0,Mon Mar 23 00:06:40 2015 UTC,I think they should have it set in a post apocalyptic setting with the story revolving around the survivors. Something similar to The Last of Us!

Although I was responding to a comment talking about being post-apocalyptic, so I was thinking of the above scenario, a few months or years after the initial outbreak. More like 28 Days Later.

residentevil,2zx03g,LexCrunch,2,Thu Mar 26 04:08:34 2015 UTC,"Trying to remember a few significant little things, including those specific to episode 1 that would help . . .   With a gamepad, call a command to your partner to see how far away they are. You can teleport them to you at a fade-out door as far as 29 meters. Teleporting Natalia to a crawlspace has to be 9 meters. If you can do this with a keyboard, I haven't figured out how. Use dodges to move faster in place of walking until you're allowed to run again. Good tool at the very start, and when waiting for your stamina to come back. Evade cancel your landing animations, and the end of climbing animations; and make sure you run into climbing actions to climb faster instead of pushing the action button. Run off ledges instead of climbing down ladders whenever possible. You don't have to carry boxes all the way up to the wall. Try to find a landmark where you can set it down and still reach the ledge. Equip a two-handed weapon at the start of the run to bypass the slow walking segments where Barry gestures at Natalia. You can break the lock with Natalia by throwing the brick. It's easier than it sounds. You can shoot the lock off of the door to the generator shack from behind the fence in the last segment before the monsters spawn. Try to kill as many revenant as possible with a fire bomb or two, and send Barry to turn on the power while Natalia waits, then send Natalia to smash the door. Time your follow command with Natalia so that Barry won't follow you too far, but not so late that the revenant will catch him. If your partner is stuck waiting, they'll take a lot of damage from grabs. Your partner will teleport to you once you reach the open doors."

There has been this Chris' STARS Vest+Flight Suit from Code Veronica floating around on Ebay for awhile now, but as rare as it is this guy's prices are a rip off.    Other than that they've made (to my knowledge) Chris' RE1 vest and possibly Wesker's although I believe it was just like the CV vest above since they were going off the Directors Cut model assuming the seller didn't just have it confused. You won't find anything for Barry or the other STARS.    Like /u/LexCrunch said, STARS usually had the patches on the shirt underneath.

residentevil,2zwit8,imagneto,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:24:58 2015 UTC,I think you have to farm. Farming is when you collect all the items in the area right after a check point. Then you reload your checkpoint and select the option to keep the items you've collected. Do this as many times as you like.
residentevil,2zv6ri,MakeshiftLeftBack,3,Sun Mar 22 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"Gotta agree completely with the Gravedigger fight. Sometimes I'll just die outright. I like to say that's the hardest part of the whole game. The Licker lab hallway in RE2 isn't actually that bad. There is a consistent route going both ways that will get you out unscathed, and if not then close to it.  For me, it would have to be the first mansion segment of REmake, and the RNG in RE3. They're not exactly difficult, but there is a large random factor involved that makes it a pain in the ass to run over and over again until it goes the way you want it to. Zombies in REmake don't always behave the way you want, and it can add a staggering amount of seconds to your time.  As for RE3, its randomized puzzles and item placements just bug me too much to ever want to run it at all. There are a few puzzles on which you can find a clue to which of the few solutions the game has randomly picked without losing time, but you'll still lose a lot of time on puzzles like the evidence room safe, the pharmacy password, or the hospital safe if you guess wrong or go out of your way to find the solution. The best possible time would be a very lucky run in which every guess is a good one, and I hate that. If that wasn't bad enough, if you find a magnum in the STARS room weapons locker, that's a reset.  EDIT: I thought of another potentially very frustrating segment in Jake's campaign in RE6. There's a part where you have to take down a helicopter, and the fastest way to do it is to do a special QTE where you climb up the chopper's drop rope and shoot the pilot in the face. The problem is that it doesn't drop dudes unless you kill all of the guys who are already on the ground, and even then it doesn't like to come until a very specific time. Making sure everyone is dead as soon as possible, then figuring out where the chopper will be and climbing the rope without taking enough damage to fall off can get really irritating if you're trying for a good time, especially on No Hope."
residentevil,2zv6ri,LexCrunch,2,Sun Mar 22 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"Haha, I never knew you could do that with Jake in RE6. I just watched a video. You start to climb the rope, then Sherry worries about how dangerous it all is, then you get to the top and shoot the pilot, then it fades to black, and Jake is on the ground, watching the chopper crash from a safe distance.

REmake can be annoying due to zombie behaviour like you said, and of course, crimson heads as well.   I've never actually found RE3's randomized puzzles that bad (although that's probably because I've played it a lot more than the others, and know all the passwords and codes to death). But I agree with you on the water room puzzle, that's pretty much an educated guess most of the time, and finding the magnum in the STARS room locker, that's a pain.

The fastest way through the zombies is to dodge them, so the only crimson head you'll ever see besides the boss is the one in the mirror hallway. Actually, now that I think about it, the mirror hallway in the return to the mansion can completely wreck your run with two zombies and a crimson in it. Again, based very much on luck."
residentevil,2zv6ri,Tekar111,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I've only done a single playthrough of RE3 way back when, why is finding the magnum a reset?"
residentevil,2zv6ri,LexCrunch,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"You don't want the magnum in a speed run because you really don't need it. It's slow and totally outclassed by the grenade launcher.  You get either the magnum or the launcher in the STARS locker and the power plant. The STARS locker is unlocked and on the way out the door, but if you take the time to open the second shutter in the power plant, that's wasting a lot of time, so it's best to skip whatever is in there and bolt for the emergency exit at the live decision after grabbing the fuse."
residentevil,2zv6ri,SilverKry,2,Sun Mar 22 22:25:31 2015 UTC,Dog Birkin as Claire can be a bit of a pain. You get grabbed youre fucked.
residentevil,2zv6ri,LexCrunch,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:41:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd forgot about that part as Claire, probably because I usually play Leon's A scenario for some reason. I always found Mr. X a pain in Claire's B scenario because you can't dodge him in some spots, so you let him punch you once and use the space he left to run around him to save time, but obviously Claire's lower HP makes this a problem."

residentevil,2zvdtv,LexCrunch,4,Sun Mar 22 04:10:18 2015 UTC,"Considering how much better RE:R2 is compared to the other games though, maybe it should take a front seat."

residentevil,2zvdtv,LexCrunch,3,Sun Mar 22 05:58:50 2015 UTC,Yeah. The point of Revelations series is to explain what happend to other characters between main events of the main games while delivering their own sub-series story
residentevil,2zvdtv,Turtlez4lyfe,3,Sun Mar 22 11:49:41 2015 UTC,Was I the only one who didn't take the ending as Natalia being possessed by Alex? Merely remembering fragments of Alex's personality like the Kafka quote.
residentevil,2zvdtv,BellyDownArmbar,3,Sun Mar 22 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, mostly because I imagine the good ending will be the cannon one with the series."

residentevil,2zvdtv,Calvalier,4,Sun Mar 22 03:48:16 2015 UTC,"We don't know when RE7 will be set, do we? Could be set in 2020.  Besides, no reason she can't be the villain, just because she's a teenager - what does a typical RE villain do? Stays hidden for most of the game, then meets the protagonist and mutates into a big monster.  That said, I somehow doubt she'll be the main villain of the game. They were very reluctant to have her die in this game (if you throw yourself off a huge cliff as Natalia, the game claims that she merely ""fainted""), so I think they have some moral objection to harming kids, which would maybe prevent them from doing it."

residentevil,2zvdtv,Xenolithium,1 point,Sun Mar 22 07:58:34 2015 UTC,"Alex Wesker has been built up for years. Resident Evil 5 actually introduced her in the documents. She will be back, count on it. Revelations 2 was a bridge for her characters because I think it was always planned for her to ""transfer"" and become a god. Capcom wanted to show this before her actually number titled debut. Considering the files state she is a) Superior to Albert Wesker in almost every way b) The adopted ""daughter"" and the most precious to Oswell E. Spencer and c) Manipulating everything from the backround. I would actually argue that she is the scariest and most potential holding villain. Especially since she is more horror focused.   I think Alex Wesker is the future of the series. There is way to much to support this. Revelation games are NOT spin offs but are directly canon. This is confirmed by the Anpo who is the director of the game as well as most of the numbered titles. The Revelations titles are however directed to the hardcore fans of the series where the numbered titles are more ""accessible"". RE7 may change this by brining horror back and Alex is the character needed to do this. Wesker is pretty much now the holy grail of the series and she will more than likely be the main villain from here on out. This doesn't mean she will be in every game, but she will be far scarier than Albert.   She made some promises and the both RE5 and Revelations 2 has made major statements for her and her plans for the future of the series. We haven't seen shit yet and Revelations 2 IS a sequel to RE5 and not 6. It takes place in between the games and is 100% canon. The ending of the game takes place between Tall Oaks (Leon's campaign) and China."
residentevil,2zue6d,Drunk3n_Axel,3,Sat Mar 21 21:36:58 2015 UTC,You don't need anything else but fire ammo and rate of fire.  These 2 mod at high level destroys everything and I'm not joking.
residentevil,2zue6d,LexCrunch,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"No, you're not. Maxed Claire's Machine Pistol mastery and put in on an MP5. Holy shit."
residentevil,2zue6d,MythicIV,4,Sat Mar 21 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"The only imperative passives in my opinion are weapon masteries. You don't really need to max them, but having a lot and early on is good. I like having a ton of magnum and handgun ammo to carry me through the level. I also maximized the rocket launcher for bosses (you get three rockets that usually one-shot at max), and put a couple levels in smoke bottles since each level gives you a whole extra one to use. I used Barry to inherit my preferred masteries to other characters so that they can better abuse magnums or whatever right out the door. You could also use Chris to inherit the rocket launcher early.  As for parts, just attach whatever the weapon needs to overcome its explicit shortcomings if possible, then beef it up with whatever if you've got space. I like to put fire bullets on my faster weapons so that I don't have to finish monsters with a shot to the weak spot.  I've also inherited more niche skills to play with like Samurai Sword, Melee Master, Evade Cancel, and Can't Catch Me. Any leftover skill slots you can fill with specialized combinations to compliment your enlarged ammo pool. Just do yourself a favor and don't do a melee build right off the bat with no weapon masteries to back it. One of my worst ideas."
residentevil,2zue6d,CrustyCouch,2,Sat Mar 21 22:20:38 2015 UTC,Would also love to know. I'm doing fine right now just throwing things together but would love to know some OP combinations to make the harder levels a little bit easier.
residentevil,2zue6d,gayinhellkid,2,Sat Mar 21 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"I usually put the BSAA and STARS attachments on my best weapon, and then depending on the remaining slots I use a capacity one, an elemental one, a critical hit chance, and a piercing"
residentevil,2zue6d,gayinhellkid,2,Sat Mar 21 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"Muramasa rifle with 50% ammo capacity, 2shot burst, icy shots and damage. 1 is left pick long range or whatever  Kite for days, normal mobs die in a single shot(well, two) and Elites drop fairly quickly aswell.  Sniper rifles in general are really fucking good. Magnum-like damage, plenty of ammo and good for long range. Once you memorize the spawning spots in maps you can also position yourself to make good use of it.  Plus if you find yourself cornered you just whip out a magnum and go to town.  As for skills, i'd say unlock Hunk's stealth and pair that with the Executioner part. Even a lvl 5 executioner is enough to have it up fairly often, i  imagine that a lvl 10 would make you permanently invisible as long as you kill 4 mobs in the process."

Assault Rifle Master, Handgun Master, Magnum Master, Shield, Armor Up, Whatever you want   Coat of Armor, Stealth, Ice Bottle, Rocket Launcher.  This is the setup that I use and I'll usually use shotgun Master in the last slot (cause I love the knock back/knock down potential is has). All around gives you lots of defensive options and will lets you mulch through most enemies by basically just running into them and spinning in circles spraying your assault rifle wildly."
residentevil,2zue6d,LexCrunch,2,Sun Mar 22 00:35:28 2015 UTC,"Passives: Katana, Melee Master, Health Up, Armor Up, Magnum Mastery (with Life Stealer), Scavenger {Evade Cancel is complete shit} Actives: Stealth Cloak, Rocket Launcher, Electric Bottle, Smoke Bottle    Most OP build ever."
residentevil,2zue6d,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"As someone who mains Wesker I enjoy the shit out of the Samurai Edge and any magnums (it has been different ones over time). Weapon masteries are key, and Fire/Frost bottles are absolutely amazing.  I haven't decided final builds in terms of exact parts yet, but firing rates and critical chances are pretty solid choices in my book. This is my set-up in terms of weapons:  (Samurai Edge [Steady Shot])   Life Stealer Lv. 3 Firing Rate Lv. 4 Daze Lv. 4 Critical Hit Lv. 4 STARS   (Magnum Anaconda [Speed Shot])   Damage Lv. 3 Firing Rate Lv. 4 Critical Hit Lv. 3 Electric Ammo Lv. 2   PS: This game, much like the previous one, is pretty open in terms of character/weapon combinations."
residentevil,2zue6d,LexCrunch,3,Sat Mar 21 23:07:26 2015 UTC,"I'm genuinely curious: what is the appeal of the Samurai Edge? I really hate it. My favorite thing about pistols is how freaking fast they reload, especially when you reload cancel with a weapon switch. It takes a high level attachment for Samurai Edge to stack up in that department, and the power increase doesn't seem like a worthy trade-off to me."
residentevil,2zue6d,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:44:40 2015 UTC,"To me it's part nostalgia (and it's fitting on Wesker's character), and it has a pretty good damage-to-fire rate ratio with not a whole lot of recoil. I don't even use pistol mastery or parts on my character and it reloads just fine when I use it.  Personally I love the shit out of it, but that might just be me."
residentevil,2zue6d,LexCrunch,2,Sat Mar 21 23:48:43 2015 UTC,"That version of Samurai Edge is actually Barry's heavily modified custom variant based off the 96F as opposed to the 92FS like everyone else's in STARS. Wesker's also had extensive customizations, but it was still a 92FS.  A perk of pistols is that there is no recoil whatsoever on any of them. That's why you can't equip them with the anti-recoil attachment.  If you try either of the other two pistols, you'll easily notice how slow the SE's reload is. It's atrocious.  With no pistol mastery, though, yeah, I could see wanting to make every bullet count. I'll want to crunch some numbers later and figure out how much better each pistol class actually is.  Sorry if I'm coming off as a jerk; that's not my intention."
residentevil,2zue6d,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"Nah it's fine. When I mentioned recoil I was referring to rate-of-fire ratio. When I need to smash the trigger to decimate things in front of me it is rather helpful as opposed to say a triple-shot pistol or something along those lines.  I personally don't mind the reload time, however the clip sizes on the SEs I have seen are pretty sad. That would be my one complaint if I had to give one. Compared to most pistols averaging at around 12-14 (from what I've seen anyways) my 9-bullet clip lacks in some fights. There might be other perks that balance it out and give it a reason to slow-load and have a small clip. Do critical chances differ with different weapons in the same class? I am curious about that."
residentevil,2zue6d,DexiMachina,2,Sun Mar 22 00:46:00 2015 UTC,"That's a good question, actually. I suspect that they do, but I don't have any solid numbers on that. If Samurai Edge had an exceptional critical hit rate, I'd be more than willing to change my tune."
residentevil,2zue6d,kikaider007,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:48:24 2015 UTC,I want to think it does. It would make sense considering the drawbacks it has. I myself haven't done too much with other pistols as I only began playing earlier this week so I couldn't tell ya much else.
residentevil,2zuaju,elgene,7,Sat Mar 21 21:03:19 2015 UTC,Just use them because it's so cheap to destroy a weapon to get them back
residentevil,2zuaju,MythicIV,3,Sat Mar 21 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"I suggest using them. Then when you want them back just destroy the weapon as money is super-easy to make back.  Later on, if you haven't already, be sure to get the toolbox. That thing is amazingly handy for making better gear and making it easier to power through higher level stuff."
residentevil,2zuaju,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Mar 21 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I use only specific guns, so having to use parts is necessary. Example: For shotguns, I only use the drake, and for handguns I only use the triple-shot handgun. So it helps."
residentevil,2zuaju,Kronos616,2,Sat Mar 21 23:55:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone here. Progress through your levels, get new weapons, throw in some parts that you want to try out.

residentevil,2ztvtv,CaptainGrimm,2,Mon Mar 23 14:42:33 2015 UTC,It'd seem weird of them to bring back a primary protagonist twice in a row.  I can see Natalia coming back as a villain when she's grown up and the ghost of wesker somehow takes her over completely (in a future RE game) but right now it's pretty obvious that they're going to do a different main character next game.

residentevil,2ztvtv,Devil_Nights,2,Sat Mar 21 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"Using the same protagonist twice in row was kind of stale even in 6, even if there were technically seven of them. I'd really hate for them to do it again. Besides, the Revelations sub-series is kind of its own thing. Making it a prerequisite to fully understand the plot of a main game would be on the same level of stupid as Kingdom Hearts.  Personally, I couldn't care less who the main character(s) will be.

residentevil,2zrt4c,gayinhellkid,2,Sat Mar 21 04:11:19 2015 UTC,"looks like maxed magazine + fire rate  Not like there is any point, the Red Code missions are easy enough as it is. Looking for better weapons is purely for curiosity at this point."

residentevil,2zrt4c,R3TR1X,-4,Sat Mar 21 07:11:11 2015 UTC,"It should be NSFW, 'cuz you raped alex."
residentevil,2zsoa9,R3TR1X,5,Sat Mar 21 11:00:32 2015 UTC,"Evade cancel isn't going to help you with the blades skip; you need to maximize the other two dodge skills for that, which you've apparently already done, so you're set.  You might be trying to dodge directly through them, which you can't do. You have to take it in portions by dodging into the hallway they come from, then dodge out of it. It looks like this.  Evade Cancel is still amazing, though. You can cancel out of slow-firing weapons, melee attacks, climbing animations, and most awesome of all, damage animations. Even the ones that knock you down or spin you backwards in the air."
residentevil,2zsoa9,LexCrunch,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:10:52 2015 UTC,Holy shit that's awesome. Haven't gotten it in campaign yet but having it in RAID mode is soooooooo abusively good. Firing that Pale Rider and waiting for slow recoil animation? Nope fuck that noise! Vulnerable after using a melee hit? I don't think so!  Quite good.
residentevil,2zsoa9,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Sat Mar 21 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"I did see a video of someone doing what you suggest, but I think they just aimed the dodge really well. I don't think it has anything to do with the evade cancel skill. I haven't found it too useful either - the only time it was useful was in Moira's scenario, when I was in an area with lots of enemies and a 2 metre ledge. If you press the dodge button while climbing up a big ledge, you can skip the last half a second or so of the climbing animation."
residentevil,2zsoa9,chofortu,1 point,Sat Mar 21 12:59:27 2015 UTC,It's pretty simple to do even without evade cancel.
residentevil,2zsoa9,Unifizz,1 point,Sat Mar 21 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"So I basically wasted 100,000 BP on something completely useless? Because I can't really understand what this thing does, or how it can possibly be useful."
residentevil,2zsoa9,chan_jkh,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:01:41 2015 UTC,"From a speed running perspective, I dunno how it can be useful.  For main game purposes, it lets you dodge in mid animation.    Some melee attacks (e.g. a lot of followups) have a relatively slow ""recovery"" animation that basically leaves you vulnerable if you're getting swarmed. You can basically perform an attack and then immediately dodge out of the way (this is especially useful in raid mode or in Moira's bonus chapter). If you're in mid reload and an enemy is about to charge at you (Ironheads and Revenants can close distances pretty quickly with some attacks), you can cancel the reload and dodge instead. If you get knocked down, you can cancel the recovery animation (or sometimes bypass the knock-down altogether, but you'll still take damage)."
residentevil,2zsoa9,LexCrunch,2,Sat Mar 21 15:17:18 2015 UTC,"You can cancel a reload even without evade cancel. Better to switch weapons, though."
residentevil,2zsoa9,chan_jkh,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:23:48 2015 UTC,"Fair point.   I don't have the reflexes to consistently pull of weaponswitch+dodge though, so it's nice that it kills a step for me. :("
residentevil,2zsoa9,LexCrunch,2,Sat Mar 21 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"I meant you can cancel a reload with a raw dodge regardless of whether or not you have the cancel skill, but that it's faster to switch weapons to cancel the reload animation after your magazine fills if you're trying to stay aggressive. You can even switch right back to the weapon you just reloaded.  I never see anyone exploit that for some reason."
residentevil,2zsoa9,chofortu,2,Sat Mar 21 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"Rest assured, Lex: I do that all the time"

residentevil,2zsoa9,XantheDread,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"Evade cancel lets you do stupid shit like ""Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife, kni - dodge mid knife - fe, knife, knife, etc, etc"". it just lets you cancel out of every action that you do and some actions that are imposed upon you by outside sources.  On a scale from 1 - 10 of usefulness to the average gamer I would rank it about a 5. To a speed runner it is definitely a 10...  Though it's hard to say what the rules for a REV2 speed run will be. Perhaps a New Game, clean category and a New Game with preset skills category."
residentevil,2zsoa9,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sat Mar 21 20:41:57 2015 UTC,"I am unsure of campaign uses myself. In RAID mode however it allows you to get off the ground after certain enemy attacks hit you as well as cancelling long firing/recoil animations, so I imagine it has some fair uses in story mode as well."

residentevil,2zpdwu,HobbieK,2,Fri Mar 20 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"It does, have you never used shareplay? If a game has local coop, you can ""hand a controller"" over to whoever joins your shareplay session and have them play the 2nd player as if they were at your house. It works but the only bad thing is you have to keep starting shareplay sessions over and over again every hour, but hey it's the next best thing to online coop since this game doesn't have online coop for the campaign. I tried it yesterday with my cousin but his connection is so bad he kept disconnecting."

I think I lost one in the first battle, and another in the sneaking section through the town. I think I lost one more after that. Still, I made it through!  Raid Mode can be very easy, but you can tailor it to be as hard as you want! I did a bunch of missions as HUNK, so he was way over the recommended level for the rest of the missions. Then, I ended up playing with Cipher until he was about 15 levels below the recommended level for the missions I hadn't played yet. That offered a very firm challenge, harder than Moira's side mission. If you're finding Raid Mode too easy, try playing 15 levels or so below the recommended level!"

residentevil,2zmmr8,thatoneguy721,3,Thu Mar 19 21:13:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your story.  I had a bit of a different introduction to the series: I was hanging out with my buddy Bryan in the summer of 2002 (I was 14, he was 16) and he had just picked up the REmake and asked if I'd be down to go through it. I had no fucking idea what kind game is was but I had definitely heard the name Resident Evil before. Although I've been on Sony's side and have had a Playstation since the PS1 I never picked up this game (or rather my parents never did...)  I sat with Bryan through every minute he played that game and I was blown away at how much I enjoyed the experience even though I never once touched the controller.  Fast forward a year, maybe two years and he let me borrow the game. I had forgotten the solutions for all the puzzles and was completely hooked on it. I made it a point for the next 4 or 5 years to play through RE1 once a year - one of my top 5 favorite games of all time.  From there I went back through RE2, RE3, and RE: Code Veronica using my PS2. Incredible. Some of the toughest and most aggravating gaming experiences ever going through those games. No walk throughs. No codes. A shit ton of patience more than anything else.  When RE4 came out I originally bashed all over it because of the 3rd person perspective and more gun action than anything else. But once I played through it on the Gamecube I lost my shit at how wrong I was and how much I enjoyed that game. I immediately started a new game the first time I beat it and ended up unlocking everything in it - obsessed.  I was stoked for RE5 because Chris was back and it was gonna be all HD and gorgeous and shit. I played through it maybe twice? Maybe thrice? Enough to unlock the infinite rocket launcher and gatling gun and what not but thought it was only OK at best. Maybe like a 6.5/10  I completely skipped RE6 as I was a bit put off by what I saw and how it looked like more of the shit I DIDN'T like from RE5. I've told myself I'll have to play it at least once but I'm waiting until it's like $5 on Steam.   I super liked Revelations 1 - the ship was a fun atmosphere and I thought that despite the 3rd person and shit it felt and played like some of the older games. Going through Revelations 2 currently (will most likely beat it tonight) and I'm not sure if I enjoy the world as much as the first. The island gameplay is fine, the story is OK, but the Queen Zenobia was wayy cooler than this island. That part where you're walking and there's the ships captain and you hear him like ""hhHHHHHHhhhheeeelllpppppp mMMMmmmeeeeEEEEE"" as you get closer and closer - SO good. Revelations 2 is relying a bit more on the tense, close quarter combat which is fine. Raid mode is a good time sink.  I prefer the original games, locked perspective and nonsensical puzzles for me any day please."
residentevil,2zmmr8,hellaLURKIN,2,Fri Mar 20 00:46:59 2015 UTC,"I was 6 or 7 years old. Found a PS1 game titled ""BIOHAZARD"" at my cousin's house. My uncle let me keep it.  Took me a while before I found out it was called Resident Evil elsewhere, but other than that I've been playing the series since."
residentevil,2zmmr8,chan_jkh,2,Fri Mar 20 09:40:00 2015 UTC,"I have to thank my uncle for passively getting me into the Resi series at the ripe old age of 6 or less.   I can remember him playing one of the older games in one instance, it was either 2, 3, or CV. Then, I got to watch him play RE4. When I was younger, that game scared me, and he would try and make me play as a joke, which scared me all the time.  But as I grew up, I grew some tiny balls and began playing the games. And I instantly fell in love with the series, I love all the games, most characters and I have made many other friends like Resident Evil too."
residentevil,2zmmr8,Ryokyon,2,Fri Mar 20 09:56:37 2015 UTC,"Played Resi 4 on Wii enjoyed it,then played REmake on GC and fell in the love the series ever since.I enjoying the series since 2012 so I'ma more of a newer fan."

We were playing in the dark on a 14"" portable lol. We got to when the hunters first appear and we were like no biggie we have a shot gun! How wrong were we. Making our way to the save roo at the bottom of the stairs in desperate need of a f.aid spray. A hunter launches round the corner and takes poor Chris's head off! So starts the screaming from both of us haha in runs my uncle and turms the playstation off! We hadnt saved for ages so we screamed some more lol. Ever since I have been hooked on the series!"
residentevil,2zooi3,BlamemyPhone,2,Fri Mar 20 10:11:59 2015 UTC,"I've yet to see a reason not to maximize the RPG with every character. That thing usually demolishes any boss character you want in one hit, or at the very least brings them within an inch of their life. By max level, you also get three of them and a decent cooldown, which is more than enough to beat any stage's parade of elites.  Makes me wonder why the drill charge skill even exists."

residentevil,2zn42v,Az366,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:12:36 2015 UTC,It's good. I just wish they kept it the way it was in the first game. I miss exploring areas to find keys and doing puzzles while fighting monsters. Not this non-timed Mercenaries fighting in a closet thing they got going now.

residentevil,2zogzn,TomVinPrice,1 point,Fri Mar 20 08:51:09 2015 UTC,"The Natalia one actually is not much fun at all. It's a 100% stealth mission, not much variety, and it's pretty short - probably just under an hour."

residentevil,2zogzn,TomVinPrice,2,Fri Mar 20 10:38:21 2015 UTC,"Haha, well, its saving grace is its brevity. Go through once, on the harder difficulty, making sure to A) not be seen and B) not use Dark Natalia's pointing ability.

residentevil,2zoei7,resifan99,9,Fri Mar 20 07:21:01 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing she's gone. Alex/Natalia is going to pick some ridiculously expensive college to study bio-sciences when she gets older. The plot of Resident Evil Revelations 3 will be centered around Barry working a desk job, eagerly trying to get a promotion to afford paying for Natalia/Alex's tuition. This is all part of the plan. Cant' take over the world with bioterrorism? Might as well get revenge on the former STARS members by slowly driving them into debt and financial turmoil."
residentevil,2zoei7,CyberneticCuntSmashr,2,Fri Mar 20 13:56:44 2015 UTC,"Well, in the bad ending, it seems that Natalia's consciousness loses the fight with Alex's. So, I guess Natalia's mind is gone; dead. You can see the struggle between the two throughout the Little Miss side mission.  In the good ending, I think they are probably still in a state of flux... it looks like Alex's will briefly overtakes Natalia's in the final shot of her, but I think that they're both still in there, somewhere."
residentevil,2zoei7,chofortu,2,Fri Mar 20 10:07:24 2015 UTC,In the good ending's scene where the helicopter rises from below the cliff I totally thought the lady in the chopper was Ada.
residentevil,2zoei7,Eponymous1990,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:55:07 2015 UTC,"Not so much about the ending per se, but I had three questions that may or may not have been answered in the documents in the game (haven't read yet, I usually play through then read them all in the pause menu after).   Why did Alex kill herself when in the later part of the story (Barry's) she was all about killing Natalia because that was her ticket to immortality? I'm assuming this is as simple as virus reanimation as it was with Albert, but how did Alex ""come back"" from shooting herself in the head? How did Natalia escape the chamber she was sealed in at the end of Claire's ep. 4?   I'm sure I would likely find these in the files but I am at work now and was wondering what the community thought as is."
residentevil,2zoei7,suchaherosandwich,3,Fri Mar 20 16:28:03 2015 UTC,"So Alex's deal is she's trying to gain immortality by switching bodies - implanting her consciousness into Natalia's body. She succeeded in transferring her consciousness, and the final step was to kill herself. But at the very last moment before pulling the trigger she experienced fear, which triggered the T-Phobos, mutating her and keeping her alive. During the 6 months before Barry arrives she goes insane, stuck in a loop where she knows she implanted herself into Natalia but is also still alive as herself. This is why she calls Natalia the ""False One"" and is trying to kill her - not just as a ""failed"" experiment, but also to prove that she is the real Alex. See above. T-Phobos. In order for the transfer to work, the recipient had to be stabilized for 6 months. Alex most likely just programmed it to wake her up after that time period elapsed."
residentevil,2zoei7,azureknightmare,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:33:30 2015 UTC,"Got it, thanks for the quick response. I figured good old self-injection would be the case in some form. I love how hidden complexities are still abundant in this series."

I know that Spencer calls Albert the ""last of the Wesker children,"" but I feel like that little detail is being retconned here.  Edit:  OR, he might have meant last as in ""the last one created/birthed/etc,"" and therefore the most perfected. We could go with that."
residentevil,2zoei7,News_Bot,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"The picture was done between 1991-1998, when both Albert and Alex worked in the Umbrella Intelligence Division. During this time, Alex Wesker was also chief scientist of the Wesker Project and kept her surname a secret.  That line by Spencer is intentional. He deliberately didn't want to let Albert know there were others, as he'd hunt them down. Spencer didn't want that, he wanted to ""pass the torch"" to Albert and see his ambition fulfilled. Alex was meant to be a secret thing that only few players would pick up on, then she was fleshed out in Lost in Nightmares.  None of the Wesker Children were created in a literal sense. They were just normal kids to particularly noteworthy parents."
residentevil,2zmtos,HobbieK,3,Thu Mar 19 22:05:28 2015 UTC,Spoilers obviously: Go back through Claire episode 3 and let Moira kill Neil instead of Claire. Ignore the QTE prompt with Claire so it lets you switch to Moira.  Then replay Barry episode 4 all the way through. You don't need to replay Barry 3 or Claire 4.

residentevil,2zmtos,AnimaOnline,2,Fri Mar 20 00:52:26 2015 UTC,"Presuming you completed the game on Survival when you got the bad ending, just go to the Extras menu and buy the Bowgun you unlocked. It makes doing over those couple of chapters so much incredibly easier that you really won't need to worry about what difficulty you're playing on.  Either way, since you can change the difficulty mid playthough I doubt it would have any an adverse effects on your ending if you did want to play Claire's Chapter 3 on Casual. I've not personally tried though so I can't say for sure."

residentevil,2znm7q,DoctorBass95,8,Fri Mar 20 02:02:11 2015 UTC,IMO it's the best RE game they've made in a long time.
residentevil,2znm7q,SouljAx360,3,Fri Mar 20 03:50:09 2015 UTC,25$ for IMO pretty fun game play. Decent story. Some great dialogue. Definitely worth it.  Barry's one liners are worth 20$ by them self. I would have considered Moira's dialogue just annoying if the shit she says wasn't just so absurd. It's great.
residentevil,2znm7q,Ryndis,2,Fri Mar 20 02:07:17 2015 UTC,Plus Raid Mode. It's excellent.
residentevil,2znm7q,lordofthederps,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:25:15 2015 UTC,"I switched the spoken dialogue to Japanese but kept the English subtitles. I only know a bit of Japanese, but I'm pretty sure Moira's lines in Japanese and English are really far apart.  Basically, it seems like they gave her a bit of an ""attitude"" for the English version."
residentevil,2znm7q,LexCrunch,2,Fri Mar 20 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"The full game with no DLC is $25. That will get you all of the campaign missions plus the bonus scenarios, and all of the main Raid mode missions. The campaign isn't all that deep; each episode purchase gives you two levels, and each level ranges anywhere from about twenty minutes to just over an hour on your very first try, but it's pretty fun and offers several replay incentives for the hardcore completionist. If the raid mode's grind-y RPG approach appeals to you, then that alone is a huge value for only $25."
residentevil,2znm7q,HobbieK,2,Fri Mar 20 02:09:23 2015 UTC,For $25 dollars you get more content than in all of $60 Evolve so yeah.

residentevil,2znm7q,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"Episode 1 takes about 3 hours to complete on your first time. There are two extra challenge game modes you can then use for new playthroughs, which will probably be about another hour or two. You also unlock 9 (I think) sets of missions on the arcade-style bonus game, called Raid Mode, which is probably at least 6 hours.  There's a lot of replayability for the campaign, because there are medals and rewards to collect by completing certain tasks, and a few in-game collectibles. Plus, there are a lot of different fun things you can try, owing to the structure of the narrative's timeline.  I don't know how much the game costs. You haven't said what region you're in, anyway.  It's worth it."
residentevil,2znm7q,Corey307,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:09:46 2015 UTC,"I bought mine retail on release date earlier this week. Considering it is a 40 dollar new game I say it is hella worth it. The game plays great (reminds me of The Suffering for those who are familiar with it), the story is intriguing, and as another user mentioned Barry's one-liners are simply amazing.  RAID mode is pretty awesome. Considering that the ""one and only"" Albert Wesker is in it as well as some previous enemies from past newer-gen RE titles making a comeback it has been one hell of a ride for me. As for the 31st's update that is simply topping to an already delicious ""Claire sandwich""."
residentevil,2znm7q,chan_jkh,1 point,Fri Mar 20 05:33:37 2015 UTC,"It's a great game when the fps don't go to shit.  #1 complaint is occasional crappy framerates in the campaign, much more serious issues in Raid mode.  It's infuriating.  The two stories are worth playing, good voice acting and I like how grimy and raw the game feels.  But I am displeased that my beastly new PC stutters constantly on Raid mode.  Turning everything down doesn't help, it's a bad port."

I've been waiting to play as her for a long time since CV and was worried the game forces you to finish the story with Barry. Claire is a very underrated character and if I can't get an entire game for her at least I wanted the chance to finish the game playing as her.  Yeah, a pretty weird question from a weird old gamer and a veteran RE fan."

The men became hyper aggressive, and the women all died in some terrible fashion or another.  As for the Old Hag comments, Barry was referring to Alex in the here and now, that is, after she became that cloaked hag-like creature they met in the tower.  Claire has her own game. It's a good thing.  Alex barely survived exposure to the progenitor virus in 1998. The only Wesker Child that adapted was Albert. She could have been permanently damaged by that, or it could be that she injected herself with T-Phobos once it had been perfected.  Alex's suicide played very well into her Kafka obsession.

Could've introduced anyone with a fear of aging etc and it would have worked almost as well.   I like the game, but people had been speculating about Alex for years (not even knowing the character's gender) and I guess I had too much hope for her to be an awesome character instead of another villain with a god complex."

I do think you tend to get rarer stuff later, maybe tied to the level of your character, or the recommended level of the stage."
residentevil,2zkfbf,gayinhellkid,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:11:02 2015 UTC,It's definitely tied to the stage level with a possibility of it being 10 more than the stage level(rarest)

As far as the hulk tyrant thing goes, he was able to bond with it but didn't have the dna like wesker to ""fully"" adapt to it. Wesker could control it wheras with Neil it merely made him a new kind of species.  It's likely it would bond differently with each person and provide varying mutations.

Correct me if I'm wrong anyone, but I am certain that this is about it.  I also picked it up for RAID mode specifically, but the story is pretty cool so far and I'm enjoying it.

residentevil,2zj1qt,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:04:36 2015 UTC,"I believe the campaign only locks out a few characters for Raid mode, and that's it (as LexCrunch says, some have specific skills that you can only get with them and have to level up to bestow them on others).   That being said, you say ""dedicating a few hours"" to work through a campaign level - even the longest one can be done in about an hour. (There's a reward for completing the whole campaign mode in three hours, and even on my first run through of each my longest time for a chapter was about 1 hour and fifteen minutes.)"
residentevil,2zj1qt,The_B,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:38:46 2015 UTC,"I think it might lock out some of the stages for the raid mode but then again the option says ""Episode X content"" so that might just mean you need to own the episode.  Other than that you just miss out on the rewards for finishing the campaign and some of the unlockable characters that require you to finish the chapters. They all have different skills and I can say now the ones for finishing chapter 2 are quite fun and a good way of getting inheritance out of the way for one skill in particular."

residentevil,2zhjpm,LexCrunch,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:43:42 2015 UTC,I have no problem with supplementary reading to get the game's plot in its entirety. It's kind of a staple of the series. This one is just kind of extra bonkers on its own.
residentevil,2zhjpm,News_Bot,2,Thu Mar 19 01:17:12 2015 UTC,"1) Natalia was safe with no human assistance needed.  2) She's not ""only"" a B.O.W. researcher. The viruses have nothing to do with the mind transfer.  3) Either she used it to hold back her illness or she did it just to measure her own fear, since she wanted to conquer it.  4) She felt fear the moment she killed herself, which activated the virus to mutate her.  5) The Afflicted were physically and mentally tortured over a long period of time and are completely different types of mutations.  6) Moira's adapted to her because she conquered fear. It's unknown what happened to Claire.  7) The Afflicted don't crave flesh, they bite because they're insane. The Rotten are Zombies, though."
residentevil,2zhjpm,News_Bot,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:40:54 2015 UTC,"Your answers makes sense, but for question nr. 1 and 2 the device (mind transfer) feel so out-of-place in a RE-game. How could Natalia just go out safely from the device? Alex doesn't seem to be a forgetful person, clearly she is obsessed in Natalia. I expected Alex to guard Natalia after the failed transfer, before the 6 month period kicks in."
residentevil,2zhjpm,News_Bot,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:06:36 2015 UTC,"There was no real reason to guard Natalia. If the transfer had worked as planned right away (Natalia was too mentally strong), ""Alex"" would've known exactly what to do, where to go etc. Instead she's forced to help Natalia survive."
residentevil,2zhjpm,Alex_Wesker,2,Fri Mar 20 11:49:39 2015 UTC,"1) I'd say that Natalia being in that ""sleep"" was her protection.   2) I think this is probably some branch of cloning technology. The Wesker children were all engineered to be brilliant; like, Ashford-brilliant.   3) Are you referring to before or after her first encounter with Claire and Moira? If you're referring to the Barry fight, at that point she was convinced that Natalia was ""false"". And she was pretty unstable by then; look what she did to a teddy bear. Also, she was looking to ""transcend"". She probably perceived transcendence the same Big Bro did.  4) fear at the moment of death.   5) Maybe brainpower deteriorates over time. Or something.  6) In Degeneration, WillPharma had developed a T vaccine. Between the FBC, WillPharma, Terrasave and the BSAA, there is/was plenty of vaccine research going on.  7) I never thought of the creatures as ""craving"" flesh. I always thought it was just another act of abject aggression, not necessarily due to hunger. Think Mike Tyson."

I had already finished the QTE as the prompt to switch to Moira appeared on my screen so I didn't realize that was possible until it was too late. The ""bad"" ending is pretty abrupt and kind of crappy, tbh.  Edit 2: Man, the bad ending is even worse when you play Moira's Extra episode, The Struggle. It ends with her finding Barry during the final boss fight.... which never happens if you've only seen the bad ending. So if you didn't know what the good ending was you'd be all ""Wtf?!"""

Barry couldn't bring himself to shoot her in the back and just kinda slumps onto the ground.... and then end. That's literally how it ends.

residentevil,2zerzi,Zaeh,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a lot of confusion about the good ending epilogue, and also the whole Alex mind transfer thing. Here's how I took it: Dark Natalia is NOT Alex, in either ending. Think about Alex's dialogue before and during the final boss fight, and the fact that she's even alive as a separate entity from Natalia at all. She continuously refers to her as false, and that she won't let her 'awaken', but the only thing that she could be referring to here (as far as the story tells us) is Dark Natalia. If Dark Natalia was Alex, then she'd have no reason to want to stop her awakening. The false one she's referring to is most likely Dark Natalia, not Natalia herself. I believe she successfully imprinted SOMETHING on Natalia, a split personality, and that split personality most likely believes it is Alex. It's not.   In regards to the epilogue, I don't believe it means Dark Natalia has fully taken over. She was in control at several points in the story already, such as when Alex backhanded Barry off the hill and then was scared off. There's also clearly a moment after that scene where Natalia seems to regain consciousness while talking to Barry. For the record, I haven't played Little Miss yet, but it feels more likely to me that the split personality struggle is unresolved (in the good ending) and both Natalias are still in there somewhere."
residentevil,2zerzi,azureknightmare,-2,Wed Mar 18 17:05:27 2015 UTC,Claire 4: Crap. Barry 4: HOLY SHIT BALLS. Also: Plot holes! Plot holes everywhere! How did Claire not tell Barry that Moira was dead during the 6 months?
residentevil,2zerzi,Zaeh,3,Tue Mar 17 23:42:50 2015 UTC,"She did (she indirectly does so even in the cutscene with her being taken to the hospital). Barry just didn't believe it, I'd assume, or Claire not being sure.  Claire's conversation with Piers (on the phone) in the ending has a slight oversight (not a plot hole though), in regards to RE 6 and where Chris was found after being AWOL for half a year. Or at least the conversation makes it seem like so."
residentevil,2zerzi,News_Bot,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:56:10 2015 UTC,"Also, Claire is being wheeled into the hospital after having made a pretty high jump into water from a tower, not to mention she still had T-Phobos in her system. She was probably out of it for awhile, at the very least quarantined.  As for the phone conversation, I always just assumed it was taking place during the segment where Chris's team was dispatched to Lanshiang. The news broadcasts in Natalia's room confirm this as well."
residentevil,2zerzi,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:00:53 2015 UTC,"That's probably it with the phone conversation, but the ""So he's in China now?"" line just makes it seem like Piers and his team found Chris in China, when in fact he's found in Edonia."
residentevil,2zerzi,News_Bot,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:21:30 2015 UTC,"No, that scene just takes place after Alpha Team arrived in China. The line doesn't make sense any other way."
residentevil,2zerzi,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:53:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems to be the only way. It's just that the aforementioned line by Claire seems to imply that Piers just found Chris in China. But I guess that's just me misinterpreting it."
residentevil,2zerzi,LexCrunch,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"I instantly thought it was just a piece of a conversation that started with ""Piers found Chris in Eastern Europe, now they're in China."""

residentevil,2zg95w,Az366,1 point,Wed Mar 18 09:52:51 2015 UTC,in EU released yesterday and surely it's gonna be tonight or tmw morning
residentevil,2zg613,eXtreme98,7,Wed Mar 18 08:39:25 2015 UTC,Maybe a Rebecca Story or Barry story   at the same time as Chris and Jill. I think it would be great or maybe a DLC with how Wesker manage to escape the Mansion like in the Umbrella chronicle.  But to be  honest i would prefer a RE 0 Remastered and Re 2 remastered.
residentevil,2zg613,zzzAlexHzzz,2,Wed Mar 18 08:50:54 2015 UTC,"My vote would be a Wesker side story, where you would be following the main characters from afar, racing to kill Enrico before he can talk, and collecting combat data to sell to the mysterious Third Organization (or whoever Wesker betrayed Umbrella for). Or the equivalent of Arrange Mode in the directors cut, item rearrangement, with nee costumes and camera angles."
residentevil,2zg613,mrbubbamac,2,Wed Mar 18 16:56:50 2015 UTC,It's very own variant of Agent Hunt.

residentevil,2zg613,sourmilkandcereal,3,Wed Mar 18 11:19:01 2015 UTC,You meant PS1 version of RE with remastered graphics? Kinda weird task to deliver since they'll just have to move some items and block some paths Played through original RE last week and got reaaaally confused about some doors

residentevil,2zd9jr,MaggleDole,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:49:29 2015 UTC,What's so confusing? They've had a release date for the full physical game available for weeks.

residentevil,2zekej,DrLeonSisk,2,Tue Mar 17 22:42:51 2015 UTC,"I actually love the attache case / item management, puzzle game aspect of re4. It adds extra required mental work into the game plus it's fun."

residentevil,2zfod0,i_am_Toru,3,Wed Mar 18 04:28:34 2015 UTC,"1) yes but you'll only get the chapter 1 missions and unlocks and you're stuff will be capped at a certain point.  2) Raid mode sees the return of Jill, Hunk, Wesker, Chris, Leon, etc etc as bonus characters while the main campaign will generally make allusions to the previous RE:R and to other titles in the series to some extent (numerous throw backs). Chapter 3 specifically deals with events from the first revelations.  3) is it on steam? Yes it is. Does steam have sales? Yes they do. Will rer2 go on sale on steam? 100% guarantee it will go on sale for some price somewhere down the line. Odds are it will probably get marked down a few bucks on its physical copy in about 4-6 months as well. Steam will be your best bet for more immediate sale results."
residentevil,2zfod0,XantheDread,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:44:22 2015 UTC,thanks alot. your answer was very informative :)

residentevil,2zes7u,LexCrunch,1 point,Wed Mar 18 05:06:00 2015 UTC,Yeah fair enough. I guess the no pants thing just rubbed me the wrong way. Kinda like the Urban Ninja outfit for Moira. There's no need for the blatant sexualizing.

Hoping that Capcom will maybe make another title similar to Mercenaries 3D where they added a bunch of levels and decent amounts of characters and such."
residentevil,2zes7u,xXFahd0onyXx,3,Wed Mar 18 04:10:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe even a standalone raid type of game with levels from 5, 6, rev 1 and 2 and all RE characters. 4 player off and online raid party's... Okay, so now I' m dreaming..."
residentevil,2zes7u,Devil_Nights,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:15:12 2015 UTC,It's basically what Mercs 3D was minus the hardware capabilities and EVERYTHING else to go with it.  I too hope that we can get something like you mentioned. All of my money would be thrown at such a game.

residentevil,2zeidk,SuzyYa,-13,Wed Mar 18 13:20:47 2015 UTC,it should be 9.99$ cause it's not that great.
residentevil,2zeidk,dumb_jellyfish,2,Tue Mar 17 22:59:51 2015 UTC,Too many downvotes for you. I kinda enjoyed it but it was very formulaic in that there was always a cluster-fuck of enemies at a predictable moment (usually later or at the end of an area). I got bored and finished the game using a trainer because if I want to be bombarded by bad guys then I'll play Serious Sam.
residentevil,2zc0d9,t51,9,Tue Mar 17 09:14:31 2015 UTC,What the fuck? This was supposed to be available when episode 4 was released...

residentevil,2zc0d9,XantheDread,3,Tue Mar 17 13:07:33 2015 UTC,"Okay... lol you do realize you said 2 weeks for both right?  Way to draw out the response and make the physical release sound more like it got it sooner with the ""just"" haha."
residentevil,2zc0d9,Salaryman_Matt,-1,Wed Mar 18 04:16:39 2015 UTC,"Consider it in this context.  Subject A buys the season pass back in february. They wait one month and a bit for online raid mode.  Subject B strolls in gamestop and buys rev2 on a whim March 17th 2015, they werent waiting before the game released for raid mode online so they're really only waiting for two weeks for it to come out.  Collectively we are all waiting I guess since the dawn of time for it to come out, but I suppose to put it in perspective we've been waiting for online mode since we learned about rev2 and its raid mode last year. And to narrow it down even more, yes, we're all technically waiting for a month for raid mode to have its online component added in."
residentevil,2zc0d9,XantheDread,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:38:05 2015 UTC,How many players max will be able to go raiding..?

If you've got a top of the line PC you should be fine, but mine will play anything on high and it chokes on Rev 2.  Shitty port, would have been a 8/10 otherwise but I only played it thru because I spent $25.  The fps drops destroy the experience."

residentevil,2zarbu,Corey307,6,Mon Mar 23 11:30:52 2015 UTC,"The difference is that RE6 is a AAA game with a huge budget, and RER2 seems to be a smaller side game that was probably quite cheap to make.  I would expect much much more from a game of RE6's budget."
residentevil,2zarbu,Turtlez4lyfe,2,Tue Mar 17 01:41:49 2015 UTC,"RER2 is meant to run on the Vita, it's a mobile game like the first one.  RE6 was just an embarrassing mess."
residentevil,2zarbu,ThePrinceMagus,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:47:26 2015 UTC,I believe a big reason why Recelations 2 is cheap is most of Raid mode comes from RE 6 and Revelations 1.  Still no excuse for average graphics and shitty frame rates.

residentevil,2zarbu,ComradeGarcia_Pt2,3,Tue Mar 17 04:54:36 2015 UTC,"RER2 cost $25.  Imagine the budget that went into that overloaded piece of trash that was RE6, and what went into Revelations 2."
residentevil,2zarbu,Troybylt,1 point,Tue Mar 17 07:22:35 2015 UTC,"True, I'm glad I passed on 6 so far.  I'll pick it up on Steam for $5 if it ever goes on sale."

residentevil,2zarbu,HobbieK,0,Wed Mar 18 20:01:24 2015 UTC,yeah because re6 is a new game right?
residentevil,2zarbu,chan_jkh,2,Tue Mar 17 02:08:49 2015 UTC,Because they shat the game out as fast as they could. Quantity over quality. Not giving a single fuck.
residentevil,2zarbu,bat_mayn,3,Tue Mar 17 02:13:35 2015 UTC,RE6 is just an embarrassment. One of the worst Triple A titles I've ever played.
residentevil,2zarbu,SeriousNag,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:22:26 2015 UTC,Which chapter is this?
residentevil,2zarbu,SeriousNag,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:56:58 2015 UTC,The very beginning of Chapter 3 in Ada's story
residentevil,2zbc8c,AkiraUmi,3,Tue Mar 17 03:52:04 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the AI, it will recover HP slowly on its own.  You have to stun the iron heads, hit them with the flash like and back up slowly, it takes like...5-6 seconds to stun them. Once they get stunned its easy.  If you want to do some damage ahead of time, aim for the red around their neck with yer gun. Thats their weak spot, of course the legs work  well too."
residentevil,2zbc8c,wrathborne,2,Tue Mar 17 04:17:55 2015 UTC,"Sadly the true weak spot is the back of their head or slightly above the metal contraption on their back. Usually I try for the magnum to one shot them (raid or campaign) but you can usually do the following: stun with moira, melee (preferably level 2 charge) with claire, run behind them, let them stand up, shotgun/magnum them in the back of the dome.  If you get the equivelent of melee master and get the level 2-3 melee charge (holding R2 at the prompt) and get the follow up mastery skill up as well (130% @ max) you can generally stun with moira, lvl2 melee, follow up attack (see if you can get moira in there too) and hit them in the head with a shot gun and just put them down like that. On normal thats what I usually do. On Survival I just kite them around as best I can and try to do what I need to do. Ammo conservation can be a real bitch sometimes :p"
residentevil,2zbc8c,XantheDread,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:27:31 2015 UTC,I like to shoot them. But the stun and kick method works. Its just VERY time consuming.

residentevil,2zae7b,RandomGuyC,3,Mon Mar 16 23:08:31 2015 UTC,"No matter what you do, if you play the main campaign, it's always a New Game+ with all of the weapons, bullets, health, expansions, mods, skills, etc. that you've collected. To my knowledge, you can't respec your skills or get rid of your weapons without starting a new save on a separate profile.  The best you can do is play Countdown or Invisible mode and roll with whatever starting loadout the game gives you, though you'll still have all your skills."
residentevil,2zae7b,LexCrunch,2,Mon Mar 16 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, I guess playing it on different profiles is how I'm gonna handle my problem.

residentevil,2zae7b,Web3d,2,Tue Mar 17 01:37:35 2015 UTC,Unless you've saved up mountains of ammo you shouldn't really be overpowered.  If you've only played a chapter or two you shouldn't have many skills unlocked either.  I wouldn't stress it too much.

residentevil,2z7uuu,sonofseriousinjury,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:41:59 2015 UTC,I agree. And for some reason my instinct tell me that Alyssa was inspired by Scarlett Johansson. While Jim kinda resembles a young Dennis Rodman that recently just graduated high school
residentevil,2z7uuu,sonofseriousinjury,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:59:05 2015 UTC,Outbreak was released in 2003 when Scarlett Johansson had just turned 19. It would be very unlikely that they would base Alyssa on a teenager given that she already an adult with career in Outbreak.
residentevil,2z7uuu,PyramidHeadd,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:07:31 2015 UTC,"She didn't look so different back in 2003. I mean understand what you are getting at. Yea Alyssa is an adult and Scarlett Johansson was in her teens at that time but they still have similar facial feature. Lets not forget that when you hand draw a character you basically have no limits. When hand drawing you can make a teen into an adult just by adding a little more details to the face, increase its height, add more muscle mass, change its hair style, and the list goes on and on"
residentevil,2z7uuu,FamilyGlue,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:29:34 2015 UTC,"That is true, but Alyssa's appearance was already finalized in the E3 presentation of RE: Outbreak (then known as RE: Online) in May of 2002. Scarlett Johansson would have been 17 at the time of that presentation, so they would have been sketching and building an adult character based on a 16 year-old, which seems even more unlikely."
residentevil,2z7uuu,DAWGPARTY,1 point,Thu Mar 19 08:34:44 2015 UTC,Lol this might explain the idea of World War Z.  Coincidently I was watching that movie last night and boy did it share a lot of similarities with RE. Not gonna go into full details just in case any of you guys havent or are planning to watch that movie in the future
residentevil,2z9vdg,SteampunkMrFoster,5,Mon Mar 16 20:48:44 2015 UTC,"Very little is directly connected, there's small references here and there to the Terragresia outbreak, and there's a very small tie to that event later in the game, but as of finishing Episode 3, its more or less the same as what RE2 has in common with RE1. Nods and allusions, but the game stands completely on its own."

residentevil,2z9vdg,LexCrunch,2,Tue Mar 17 18:31:30 2015 UTC,"I thought the story in Revs 1 was kind of difficult to follow, but that could totally just be me being completely stupid and not paying attention. I barely remember it, but Revs 2 has callbacks to major events, settings and organizations from the first one; so you might get a little lost with what some of the characters are talking about sometimes."
residentevil,2z9vdg,drtyfrnk,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:24:46 2015 UTC,"No I played the first one and loved the story, that's why I asked."
residentevil,2z7ubh,Metapher13,8,Mon Mar 16 09:52:34 2015 UTC,"Prepare yourself for a long adventure. The first 3 REs took me about 6-7 hours each to beat on my first time through. Code Veronica took me almost 13 hours!   The story can be hit or miss. The new characters/villain(s) are fairly eccentric in personality. Personally I enjoyed it. It felt like a return to the silliness of RE1 in a way.  Gameplay-wise expect more RE2 than RE3. I've always thought CVX was a step-back in terms of gameplay from RE3. There isn't any dodging, no ammo crafting, no 'live-decisions' to make. You could argue that these don't exist because Claire is less trained than Jill, but still.  Another comparison would be how set-in-stone everything in CVX is. The player doesn't have a lot of control over what happens. Compared to RE1 and RE3 where your actions give you different outcomes.  The camera works slightly different in this game. There are some fixed angles still but now the camera will move with your character. Turn a corner and the camera turns with you. It's kinda hard for me to explain, but you'll see what I mean when you play.  CVX is one of my favorites even if it sounds like I'm dissing it. Feel free to ask more questions if you have them. Also, you're playing the ""HD"" version on PS3 right? Prepare for areas that are way more dark than they should be.  Quick tip: conserve ammo in the beginning by using your knife. The knife in CVX is really powerful, especially against living things. CVX knife can do multiple hits per slash. Swiping downward at the legs will make enemies fall down. Then swipe their downed body. Rinse repeat until dead."
residentevil,2z7ubh,Krusiv,2,Mon Mar 16 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"That's quite a lot longer! I hope it doesn't feel repetitive - but I've heard there's some change in scenery so it should be fine.    Those were points I didn't care much for in RE 3 anyway. The ammo crafting was fine, but the others were so-so. I guess I never got the dodging mechanic down perfectly, so that probably made it less enjoyable for me. RE 2 is my favorite of the 3 solely on gameplay.    Yeah it should be the HD version (CVX brought through PSN). Did they just fuck it up with the darkness, or does it add something positive to the experience too?"
residentevil,2z7ubh,Krusiv,2,Mon Mar 16 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"It didn't feel repetitive for me. I think it's paced well and you are correct on scenery changes. Don't want to spoil much so that's all I will say on that.  I think it's a matter of them just fucking up the darkness. :/ You can try to adjust the brightness but in my experience that made it look even worse. It didn't add any positives to me because it's the kind of dark where you can't see anything, not 'atmospheric' dark.  To be fair the later parts of the game are well lit compared to the early parts. You should be OK if you can truck through the early sections. The game overall is functional so don't worry too much. It's basically CVX with an HD/darkness filter."
residentevil,2z7ubh,sungazer69,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:02:25 2015 UTC,That's a shame. But at least they didn't mess it up as much as the Silent Hill 2 HD!
residentevil,2z7ubh,sungazer69,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"One a couple of those notes...  Yeah the game is long.  To get an A rating, the other games require finish times under 3 hours or something.  Code veronic it's 5 I believe.  And that's on speed runs!  So yes the game is long.  CV is actually full 3d environments with slightly moving cameras, not pre-rendered backgrounds, which can be hit or miss.  Prerendered backgrounds can look nicer, but 3d is 3d.  All good."
residentevil,2z7ubh,AshRichardson,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:25:27 2015 UTC,"Let's just say that I got like an E rating on RE3... so I guess I'll be playing for quite a while, haha.

residentevil,2z7ubh,CaseyEvil16,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:34:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely sounds appealing. And while there are more weapons, it also sounds like ammo is still scarce, right?"

residentevil,2z7ubh,Billy_Pilgrim86,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"It's been said, but yes, make multiple saves, and do stagger them.  CVX can will screw you over, and cause you to have to restart.  But since you've played through the others, you'll be a-okay. Just try and save that good ammo for the... not normal stuff."
residentevil,2z8fkp,Kjima,2,Mon Mar 16 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Its a tough fight to be sure, took me multiple tries, even on co-op. (On Survival Diff)  My advice is to ignore the side enemies and shoot the dude a lot. I'm surprised it hasn't died from all the stuff you threw at it.  Don't give up! Claire's Chapter 3 is so good!"
residentevil,2z8fkp,HobbieK,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty surprised too it didn't die with the amount of punishment he took.  I don't attack the other enemies, as they respawn, so it's useless, but it's tough how a single mistake can take you out, and they are so many enemies running at you. (I find it pretty dumb that every enemy in the game can outrun you given the chance, not much you can do when there's 3 afflicted, 4 ironheads and the boss dashing toward you)"
residentevil,2z8fkp,kriki232,2,Mon Mar 16 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"I thought I was going to throw the darn game out my window during that boss and I wasn't even on survival. What I did was run around A LOT. Spam that dodge button like no tomorrow, keep the camera moving make sure you see whats coming at you all the time. Get close to the boss and aim for the head. When he shoots the fire make sure to run around and dodge, if that fire hits you, its bad. Use herbs and the items that stop bleeding. Make sure he never is close enough for him to crush into you. Use the machine gun in short bursts and KEEP RELOADING. pick up all ammo whether you need it or not."
residentevil,2z8fkp,apocalypserisin,2,Mon Mar 16 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"First few tries it seemed impossible with the mobs, but as soon as I ran around ignoring them, and just dumped ammo on his face, I killed him in less than 5 min from cutscene to his death.  I chucked like 4-5 upgraded bottles at him, so I didn't even burn through as much ammo as I thought I would.  Did it on survival.  On a side not, I don't understand why people babysit their Moira and keep them out of trouble, I spend 75% of the game as her running right into mobs and beating everything down including iron heads.  At the start of each area I tell Claire to wait, and clear it as Moira, running in circles when near death then charging her back in after a few seconds"
residentevil,2z8fkp,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:00:39 2015 UTC,"Tell Moira to wait by the stairs so she doesn't die, and use the three or so decoy bottles you made at the start of the chapter to distract all the bad guys while you shoot the boss in the face. You can also get up close to it and bait his crappy melee attack so you can dodge it and retaliate over and over again, making him useless.  You're playing on the hardest difficulty, so you're going to have a tough time if you don't have the more important skills maximized. No shame in stepping down to Normal until then."
residentevil,2z8fkp,AnimaOnline,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"Sneak in and stealth kill the very first guy. You seem to have to skip the cutscene otherwise he sees you before you get a chance to hide. From there on just ignore everyone but the boss. Killing the others just causes newer, harder waves to spawn which you don't want. Now just keep moving, aim for his head and go all out."
residentevil,2z8fkp,XantheDread,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"Tip #1 the exploding enemies damage all other enemies. Line those guys up beside the boss and pop them to deal more damage. I usually use exploding bombs becuase it lets me damage the boss, hurt or kill smaller enmies around him, and explode the bursters to deal more damage to the boss and kill the peons   2 you can stun him very briefly with the flashlight if you want to get a little bit of risk free damage in. Unlike status effects in other games I have yet to see the flashlight stun have a decay in effectiveness over time. So give that a shot.  3 try to avoid killing the small dudes as best you can until you can get them nice and lined up. If you have cover and can hide from biggy, consider moving behind said cover and putting some of the small guys on the geound for a follow up attack from moira and claire (this can thin the horde without draining your ammo supplies.  4 decoy bottles are a god send. Get those suckers at the ready when you can to keep the small dudes off you and the big dude distracted while you dish out punishment.  5 consider going back to chapter one on claires side and grinding out some BP to get the upgrades that you want (obviously the sub weapon booster is great) specifically the +10% damage after switching characters, AND the +120% (i think that s the cap might be 115%) damage after switching weapons. You can match that up with the +x% damage if its the last round in the chamber if you feel like grinding that much :/ this will basically meam that on the last round in the shotgun you can be doing nearly double damage, and even without the last round perk, you can still be doing almost 50% bonus damage!"

Think frame rate issues are bad? Try lack of in-game cinematics in favor of shitty FMVs of the gamecube cinemas, and zero mouse support. Oh, and it looked like dog shit compared to the PC versions."

residentevil,2z9zat,Eponymous1990,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:15:28 2015 UTC,le to 60 made it a bit better for me but it's still stuttery at times.   to fix that you gotta choose 30 fps mode The micro stuttering was gone for me when I chose that... but I get a 1 sec freeze every few steps or shots....
residentevil,2z9zat,AkiraUmi,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:58:36 2015 UTC,"That's what I get at 60 fps, the first few shots and steps freeze the game but it becomes more manageable later on until the game loads again then the same thing happens. I'm guessing this problem is because the game only loads some assets at the split second you need it."

residentevil,2z78r3,LexCrunch,11,Mon Mar 16 06:06:54 2015 UTC,"Seriously! Haters cant see reason. Re6 was a great game once you get past the slippery controls, convoluted, overblown story, unlikeable new characters, linear path with waypoints, abundance of quick time events, lack of originality, fighting the same boss 20 times in different forms, no puzzles, no atmosphere and no horror outside of the first bit of leons campaign...the halfassed mercenary mode, having the ability to just melee most monsters to death, tripping, the confusing/irritating inventory screen,  collecting points for nearly useless upgrades, monsters with guns everywhere, chris'  entire campaign, and the fact that the game has absolutely zero resemblance to any of the earlier games that catapulted the series to legendary status and made it a household name among gamers and horror fans alike... once you get past those few things its really great. Stupid haters, no logic, no reason."
residentevil,2z78r3,JudyRoseKills,2,Mon Mar 16 06:25:34 2015 UTC,Now tell me what you didn't like about the game?
residentevil,2z78r3,thedude2618,2,Mon Mar 16 10:05:01 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. For some reason, they couldn't get over the fact that it wasn't a horror game by any stretch of the imagination and consequently looked for reasons to hate it instead of rolling with the solid action game it was and actually enjoying themselves."
residentevil,2z78r3,LexCrunch,2,Mon Mar 16 15:12:46 2015 UTC,"RE5 is great as an action game but god forbid anyone praise RE6 for being the same thing!!   I'd tend to agree with you. Do I prefer the original style with puzzles, exploration, and non-linear scenarios? Yes, definitely. But when looking at RE4, 5, 6 as action games I think they are all on the scale of decent-to-good.  I'm not too picky. The games feel like RE to me if I'm hunting down biological weapons while trying to take down an evil organization. Whether that's in a horror setting, action setting, whatever.   Style(?)-wise I could do without all of the enemies with (literal) guns. Projectile attacks are more than fine, but this is a series with many different types of B.O.Ws as enemies. Certainly Capcom could think of a better enemy design than ""monster with a GUN!"" They did it for Revelations -- the ooze with the claw/projectile arm."
residentevil,2z78r3,Krusiv,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:51:31 2015 UTC,Then capcom should quit pimping the RE name and use another. Theres not more nonhorror RE games than horror ones. RE isnt a horror series....only the first few installments were

It went full Gears of War, it was embarrassing, but I see why they added the playstyle. I think it's just something I have against the new Chris. I liked Leon's campaign a lot but I think it's obvious why. Jake's was boring and frustrating. Ada is fun, but most people never get far enough to play her. I honestly can't believe I did, but it redeemed my last 2 boring Jake and Chris games since I started with Leon."
residentevil,2z78r3,HeDontUseWASD,1 point,Mon Mar 16 10:05:02 2015 UTC,I enjoyed as well but yeah Chris's campaign was too over the top and didn't feel like an RE game at all.

residentevil,2z78r3,Gamergirl182,2,Mon Mar 16 21:02:38 2015 UTC,"Just forget those two and find a way to play 2 and 3. If you like the hd remaster you'll like 2 and 3 very much as well. They aren't dated when it comes to gameplay. They're as creepy, original, and fun as they were when they were first released. Just emulate them, save your money on revelations and 6. Revelations gets praised because it wasn't as bad as 6, but its the same new re formula of annoying Ai partner, no actual puzzles, blast everything constantly third person shooting. Generic is the word."
residentevil,2z78r3,Strider_,2,Mon Mar 16 06:46:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say play 6 because you'll likely only put a few hours into it before wanting to quit, so you can move on to revelations quickly, and have a better appreciation for it. If you play revelations first 6 is really gonna be a let down. I don't think revelations is all that great either, but compared to 6... Too bad you can't find 2 and 3 anywhere. They're great even without the hd upgrade."
residentevil,2z78r3,IAmTriscuit,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:46:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Play 6, realize it's a mess of a game with the only decent campaign being Sherry's, quickly quit, then move on to revelations, which is a great game."
residentevil,2z78r3,EQUASHNZRKUL,2,Mon Mar 16 04:48:51 2015 UTC,Man I hated that campaign! I thought Ada's was the only one I could get through. Leon's was okay cuz Helenas ass.
residentevil,2z78r3,LexCrunch,2,Mon Mar 16 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"They're both great, but I'd recommend playing Revelations first. Otherwise, it's going to be really awkward to transition from 6's more free form movement and action focus to Revelations' claustrophobic scheme.  Besides, the real meat of Revelations is the hours of time you may wish to dump into the raid mode."
residentevil,2z78r3,PSaddict,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"Why not get both? They are both reasonably priced. RE6 has four different stories to follow which makes things interesting.

residentevil,2z750f,wrathborne,5,Tue Mar 17 00:01:59 2015 UTC,"/u/chofortu's JILL SANDWICH  Ingredients:   1 jill 500ml of Bariadorgia 100g chopped Burton nuts 1 avocado 1 ciabatta loaf 50ml of armagnac 20g butter 30g grated ginger 1 handful of watercress Salt, pepper, paprika and MSG to taste   If your jill has not been prepared, eviscerate and skin it, then soak it in a fast-flowing river for a couple of days to degrease it.  Dice and brown the jill in a frying pan with the butter. When golden, flambée with the armagnac, and add the ginger, paprika, salt, pepper, and monosodium glutamate. Stir to combine, pour over the wine, and simmer gently for a couple of hours.  When the jill is almost done, turn the oven to 110°C and add the ciabatta. Thinly slice the avocado.  Remove the ciabatta from the oven when warmed through. Slice in half, and rub the inside with some of the jill's cooking juices. Layer over the avocado, Burtons, and watercress. Drain the jill mixture, retaining the juices if you wish to make /u/chofortu's JILL STEW. Add the jill to the ciabatta half, place the other half on top, and carve into separate sandwiches.  Serve with a glass of Bariadorgia. Enjoy your fucking ferret sandwiches."

residentevil,2z51w5,mrbubbamac,14,Mon Mar 16 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"To answer my own question, there's these kinds of ""optional puzzles"" at certain points in the older games which have no bearing on you actually progressing, but just help out in one way or another.  One example is during Code Veronica, where there's this hallway with windows on either side and a button which locks down the windows with metal railings. If you dont lockdown that area at a certain point, zombies will break through the windows and fill the hallway.   It seems like an insignificant thing but I love the idea that you can do certain things to the environment which can save you that much more ammo and stress without it being integral to the progression of the game.

Moira and Natalia, Jake, Helena, Sheva, Jills' slightly overweight partner from Rev 1. Sherry, kind of.  They don't do much with them, though. Their attention is mainly on Leon, Jill, and Chris. I guess they consider them the core of RE by now."
residentevil,2z51w5,CrimsonRex,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:25:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess I mean shifting away from the largest chsracters. Focus on newer ones and give them leading roles instead of secondary

residentevil,2z7cca,HobbieK,7,Mon Mar 16 05:15:44 2015 UTC,"The bonus games have always gone against the grain of the main game; that's part of what makes them fun and interesting. You get a more straightforward, action-focused environment with no distractions that ultimately hones your combat skills well beyond what the main game could offer.  Revs 2's raid mode is simple and fun, but it doesn't in any way detract from the campaign, which is really well done in the way it hearkens back to some of the older games by rewarding exploration and experimentation with positive and negative consequences and fancy items to encourage multiple replays, so I'm not sure exactly what your complaint is. If anything, Revs 2's raid mode actually felt shallow and phoned in. It's stupid easy even when shooting for completion medals, and every character is essentially the exact same thing. Once you get your high level gear, it's all applicable to every other character, too, completely removing the looting aspect from subsequent grinds.  The thing is that there's a bit more longevity in raid mode than in the campaign. You finish the campaign with a satisfactory time and on all the difficulties and special modes and you've seen almost all there is to see. Your friend might tell you about a thing you didn't think of and you'd play it again and that's about it. Raid mode gives the same completionist players a lot more content to check off with tons of levels, characters and skill combinations to play with, and more enemy varieties that can't be done in the campaign, which is probably why you're perceiving it as the primary focus: it's a much more interesting topic for group discussion, so it gets talked about more and later down the game's life.  Even the older games had a bonus game to extend their lifespan. With the exception of Mercenaries in 4, 5 and 6, and RE1 on Saturn and CV's Extreme Battle games, they definitely weren't like Revs 2's cut and dry arena approach, but they were still something to look forward to, and easily where most of my time went after completing the story. What I'm trying to say is that the allure of the bonus game is definitely not a new craze."
residentevil,2z7cca,LexCrunch,4,Mon Mar 16 05:56:06 2015 UTC,I miss Mercs...
residentevil,2z7cca,LexCrunch,2,Mon Mar 16 05:59:27 2015 UTC,Agreed. Mercs wipes the floor with Raid. Let's hope for another good one in RE7. I'm still having a blast with 5's and 6's.
residentevil,2z7cca,XantheDread,2,Mon Mar 16 06:00:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I loved mercenaries back in RE4, Hunk was unstoppable back the with neck breaker and Krauser was God tier. I wish they would bring back the unique executions that we had back then.  More on point, it would be nice if in chapter 4 the released some Raid Mode levels that still had an end point of ""kill X amount of dudes"" but put you on a mercenaries type setup, 3minutes, bust hourglasses to get more time. I guess every character would have to get innate scavenger though or more ammo boxes on the map..."
residentevil,2z7cca,CFGX,2,Mon Mar 16 12:29:11 2015 UTC,I prefer Raid Mode because of the lack of reliance on the time game.
residentevil,2z7cca,XantheDread,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"Oh dont get me wrong the currwnt Raid Mode is great and I'm all for it. I just wish there were more game modes. As it stands its generally, start, kill X, win.  I think it would be cool to do like a countdown mode game mode where you can add time and clocks randomly spawn. Then you get boosts to the count down while keeping track of your overall time. The longer you are in a game the more exp, gold, and albums you could potentially get. They could make it so you cycle through stages too. Like you open a door into the Zenobia casino where at the end you open the door and are in the village from RE4. Really play up the ""you are in a simulation controlled by a lunatic"" kind of feel."
residentevil,2z7cca,krizalid70559,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the Extreme Battles in Resident Evil 2 was the best bonus game mode in Resident Evil history, with Revelations 1 Raid mode and CV Battle mode.

Mastering the gauntlets of Raid mode harkens back to the originals in that way. I'm not saying I love this game(I don't), but the raid mode is actually my favorite part.  The campaign feels like a shitty ""Last of Us"" clone."
residentevil,2z7cca,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"So actually you just compared campaign to mere optional game mode, which doesn't matter much really."

residentevil,2z86ap,MrOlympus,2,Mon Mar 16 12:46:20 2015 UTC,"I thought the puzzles in this episode (Claire’s/Moira’s side) was a little bit frustrating, really because the game went from little to no puzzle to ALL PUZZLES really quick.  I really hated how some of these puzzles just punish you with death with no warning.  For example the puzzle in the slaughterhouse where you take the key and the gate will lock down, and the spinning blades just come at you; if you didn’t have one of the character on the outside waiting to pull the level, you’ll just be stuck in there, waiting to be killed by the traps.  The other one is when you had to escape from the explosion, you had to choose one lever to pull, but honestly the first time you play, you will have no idea which one to pull, and because of the time limit you really would just pull a random one, which is 75% death.  The boss fight with Neil was pretty difficult, and very much traditional Resident Evil.  Neil is basically a bullet sponge.  He wasn’t especially hard once you get his gimmicks, but it does take a long time to kill him just because Claire doesn’t have a magnum (which is really the only strong weapon in the game, all other guns are like toys???).   Barry’s/Natalia’s side was a little bland and short for sure, the Uroboros tentacle thing was a bitch to fight in Raid Mode but it’s not that bad in campaign mode.    Overall, I wouldn’t say this episode is “pointless”.  The revelations (no pun intended) of Neil being a backstabber was a slightly unexpected plot twist for me.    But honestly though all these new characters introduced in the Revelation series (Parker, Jessica, Raymond, Neil, Gina, etc) are just really forgettable.  They offer little to no importance to the main story line and I doubt anyone cares for ANY of them.  Maybe except for Alex."
residentevil,2z86ap,krizalid70559,2,Mon Mar 16 14:06:31 2015 UTC,"First of all, can I say thank you for taking the time to reply in a such a comprehensive manner.   I think we're on very similar pages with regards to all this. Closer than maybe our words suggest. I too died a couple of times with the puzzles, but I didn't go into that because a)spoilers and b)they didn't frustrate me and I was quickly past them.  Neil was a sponge but you at least had to get him on fire and have a bit of awareness. I'll have to check but I'm pretty sure I did pick up a magnum with Claire, or at least a more powerful gun.  With regards to the 'pointless' comment, I meant the Barry/Natalia chapter and not Claire/Moira. Maybe I could be clearer on that.  Alex is an interesting one. It's been said before about the Wesker program, but I'd forgotten about it. I'm assuming we'll find her normally as C/M where she'll change, then fight her again as B/N."
residentevil,2z86ap,krizalid70559,2,Mon Mar 16 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't fully explore the game so maybe Claire had the chance to obtain a Magnum, but all I have is an assault rifle and a shitty shotgun.  The boss fight took way too long because Neil just would not die.  The only redeeming quality of that boss fight was when Neil attacks again and Moira was forced to pick up the gun - while that was a pretty cool way of telling the story... it was also kind of expected that no monster stays dead in RE EVER.  Also, I didn't understand when Moira and Claire think they have an upper hand simply because Alex Wesker would think the two of them are already dead.  Doesn't Alex Wesker have monitors all over the island?  How would they have an element of surprise?  What?  I agree Barry's/Natalia's side was a little lackluster.  Right now all I care about is what happened to Alex Wesker, why did she become a hideous thing?  And I have a hunch that Natalia is going to be the last boss and Barry will have to kill her, that would be fucked up and original.  Here's hoping Alex Wesker being the final unlockable character in Raid mode."
residentevil,2z86ap,krizalid70559,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:55:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, I think I ended it with a better shotgun, the magnum, pistol and an Uzi type thing.  The Moira gun thing passed me by a bit, I didn't press a button so Claire shot Neil. Damn it! But you're right, no boss stays dead!  I did wonder that too. Alex can see everything they've done, plus they still have the bracelets on. Of course she'd know what was going on.  Ooooo good shout on Natalia. That would be an interesting way to go, and harsh."

On one hand, Claire has that stupid puzzle with the randomized solution at the end of the blast furnace that will instantly kill you seven minutes into a run; and Barry has the longest slow-walking segment in the game so far, an escort segment, and lots of carrying heavy boxes.  Also /u/chofortu, your time isn't as bad as it looks. It's not fantastic, but Claire's mission is exceptionally long. WR for that is a whole fourteen minutes.  EDIT: RNGsus hates me.

Leon and Krauser were in US SOCOM together, and a particular mission to South America in 2002 made Krauser jump ship to Wesker's side. He faked his death in a helicopter accident later on, which is why Leon is so surprised to see that he's alive in RE 4."
residentevil,2z2uy1,Zaeh,3,Sun Mar 15 01:33:14 2015 UTC,"Leon wasn't in USSOCOM (he was USSTRATCOM) and the nature of Krauser's ""accident"" is never elaborated. The Japanese script just says accident, rather than the English script's ""crash."""
residentevil,2z2uy1,News_Bot,7,Sun Mar 15 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what /u/zaeh said.  Your confusion is actually one of my big gripes with RE4. I hated Krauser so much, and the back story for this lame one-shot character wasn't even touched upon until almost a year later on the PS2 release in Separate Ways, albeit briefly, and then again in full four years later in Darkside Chronicles. All you get until then is a small bio entry in the instruction manual, and if you even read it, you're waiting more than half the game for him to show up or at least be mentioned."

Basically anti-leon if you think about it in those terms. The mutant thing was dumb but lets face it - it's Resident Evil; and the designers needed to give him a final boss form.   He's just some guy that I kept thinking ""Who the fuck is this and why should I care?"" And the question was never answered.   Dont worry, I agree - First playthrough I found his entire contribution just so hilariously devoid of any substance or development that I just didn't care. I haven't even played Darkside. But again, it's Resident Evil. If you just think about him as a dumb villain with some cool lines and scenes, he becomes highly entertaining.

He starts luring zombies to that room one by one and ambush them, tying each to a chair and sticking a party hat on their heads just like he did to a now zombified Marvin.  Imagine later on to Claire's surprise when she comes to this room to see all these struggling zombies bound to chairs and wearing party hats, only to hear off to the side ""Welcome to the party, Claire."" just before she's knocked out and now left to the same fate as the zombies.  Except, she's still alive. She's force-fed stale cake, melted icecream, and flat warm soda just like the other zombies and she's completely helpless to defend against Leon's growing insanity that makes Chief Iron's pale in comparison. Nothing she says can convince Leon to free her as he's too busy laughing and making best of what he has around him.

As a result, he overslept and began the long drive to Raccoon City already late for his first day. Due to the media blackout surrounding the city and the lack of radio contact with the R.P.D., he was oblivious to the ruined state it was now in. The R.P.D. itself had already been wiped out, a fate Kennedy avoided with his lateness."

The group project to finish the game based on what's basically a demo disc is astounding, too. The level of work these guys are doing takes great knowledge and understanding of coding specific to Resident Evil. If it was scrapped so late in development, though, then I have to trust that what we got in the end is worlds better than what we would have had.  It's typical to long for what we can't have, and now a group of guys are making the impossible possible, which is very exciting. I've played the really early demo of 1.5 from a little over a year ago and while the revitalization project is absolutely amazing, the game's assets themselves were largely unimpressive. The characters and setting just didn't feel nearly as pronounced and distinguished. I'm definitely looking forward to playing a finalized version of what could have been, but always bearing in mind that it was scrapped for a reason."

I hope it will coeme out soon working as any othwr re game.  Im a big re fan and seeing it and how they scrapped it instead of making it as a bonus ""demo""  in a collection edition annoys me.  I understand why they scrapped it.  It started quite wierd and it didnt have much personality and i bet they felt that the game had no relation to re1 beside zombies!  So i think its a good thing they changed it cuz re2 is great and having claire looking for her brother made it feel more as a serie. But  they had some things in re1.5 that i think would of been great in 2 like the fat zombies that takes alot of hits and if u blow off the legs they start crawling to you or if u shoot off upper body they walked towards u without the upper part with them. I hope it comes out from capcom themselfs just like a small game.  Shouldnt take to much worj to fi  itup for new cobsoles and pc and putting it either as a standalone or dlc or in collection edition of like re7."

There is another skill that allows you to melee really fast, I forgot the name, but if you have those 3 skills equipped at a high level, you can basically kill everything in 1~2 hit, and you attack REALLY fast so you're basically invincible against normal enemies.

They've touched on RE2 a bunch in the past, remaking it in Darkside Chronicles and large chunks of the environments and a handful of moments in Operation Raccoon. I imagine REmake's huge sales will help push them in that direction, and I imagine that it might be in the cards. Not inevitable, maybe, but certainly a strong possibility.

The Omega level in episode 4 probably has six. That chime is the sound of the goal post spawning in. It usually appears after a certain enemy or number of enemies is defeated, but some levels just have it start out hanging around, so you hear the sound before you come in. Wuss. They are pretty cool monsters, though. I like how they poop on you for some reason after they kill you. You probably just missed the option.

residentevil,2yy5lj,XantheDread,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:42:45 2015 UTC,"I think we're not taking into consideration the ""next time"" clips where natalia appears to have become evil. Rather.   I assume we'll find out that Natalia was Alex Weskers surogate or replacement body. She has been injected with T-Phobos and bonded so perfectly with it that Natalia now has Albert Wesker like properties (except shes a child so her powers havent fully manifested) with eventual super strength, eventual super speed, super intelligence, and what I think is some kind of mind controlling/altering power (the reason why Alex screams in terror at the end of chapter 3). I feel that because of all these factors Natalia was able to escape the tower (perhaps assisted, perhaps shes astral projecting or some nonsense of the like) so Alex couldn't transfer her consciousness into Natalia. I would imagine this would have something to do with Claire and Moira's story line and most likely end with Alex falling down a pit/getting burried under rubble/exploding in an explosion where she has no choice to inject T-Phobos (if she hasnt already) which causes her to mutate into the revenant like husk we see in Barry/Natalias story line.  Odss are claire and moira will be sealed away in a pod/tube/hibernation thing and Barry will rescue them both. As for Natalia... Perhaps she was behind the whole thing and really is evil. I doubt that she is innately evil but... Her vissage seems to be on the coins in the game and there is some evidence to point towards it. I mean we still havent had Claire or Moira or anyone else comment on the fact that Natalia's bracelet is red and all the documents on the island say""if it goes red, shoot the person on site. Mutation is imminent""."

residentevil,2ywi6s,bigblackcouch,2,Fri Mar 13 12:14:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's because they can add those maps as they already exist from code base, they just copy them to the game. Creating old game maps from zero to the new engine would be hard. Or they feel lazy."

It's not a huge amount, but for example if you have a magnum with 6 slots, there's no reason to put anything else in those 2 extra slots since nothing else is as useful as the slight damage increase. Fire is great on rapid fire weapons. I'd say ice is completely useless, slowing enemies down a little bit for 2 seconds really doesn't do much at all for survival, especially once you have a good survival ability (Stealth Cloak, Invincibility, etc..)"
residentevil,2ywq21,Unifizz,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:02:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. By the way I did know the weak point of the Golems, I was asking how to stun them consistently.

residentevil,2ywq21,Unifizz,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:12:52 2015 UTC,"stunning them consistently is just by hitting their weakpoints, same as any enemy.  Doesn't seem like it is, so definitely prioritize those ones (Damage, Elite Killer) first."

residentevil,2ywq21,Unifizz,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:29:19 2015 UTC,fire is a DoT  ice slows  electric sets a debuff that causes them to take more damage

residentevil,2ywq21,XantheDread,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:24:38 2015 UTC,"Not sure how it works but electric ammo + electrocute both at max level could probably do some serious damage. Good way to boost a machine pistol output. Shock the target on the first hit to proc the standard electric ammo damage boost, target is being electrocuted so all subsequent damage is being multiplied by the electrocution part."
residentevil,2ywq21,wrathborne,2,Sat Mar 14 02:54:27 2015 UTC,"Iron Head: the giant hammer wielding afflicted, you do more damage shooting them in the legs really. when they collapse you can give them a finishing move. Yeah the weak spot is the red around their neck, but you don't always get a chance to hit it, the legs are better for slowing them sown. Skagdead: Rev1 monster, shooting it in the human head does most damage, but because of how fast they are you may not be so lucky. Focus on the body in that case. Afflicted and rotten: pop em in the head for a brief stun and melee them. Orthos:  Pig-dogs, no weakest point. just shoot them and they stumble. Use shotgun for best results. RE 5 Executioner: headshots all the way. Use electric ammo if you can, you need the extra damage on these walking tanks. Hunters: head is the weakest area, however they seem to take extra melee damage. So if you stun one melee it and save your ammo. Vulcan Blubber: the fire throwing monster, head followed by legs seems to work. Napad: the giant armored turd monsters from RE6. Blast their armor off and focus on the head. The sniper rifle works well on these bullet sponges. Revenant: honestly its the luck of the draw with these bastards. Theres no guarantee you'll find the weak spot until you blast the flesh off the right part of its body. Best thing about them is how weak they are to fire."

residentevil,2yvuiz,BlamemyPhone,4,Mon Mar 16 00:32:59 2015 UTC,"My favorite episode thus far, although to me Barry's campaign in general is just way too easy. At the end of the episode 3 I have 11 green herbs and a ton of ammo... I almost never take damage because most of the time I just stealth kill enemies, in Claire's campaign I just cannot seem to stealth kill anything at all. I don't know if anyone would agree that Claire's is just harder overall, its not THAT hard but I do struggle a lot more in Claire's campaign.   Anyway as far as the episode itself goes - I really enjoyed it a lot. The puzzles were a nice change of pace although I felt really stupid because I couldn't figure out clue #3 for the longest time on Claire's grave puzzle. I liked how long Claire's episode felt too, the ending scene if you make Moira do it is neat too... sadly when I played I mashed square so fast that I didn't even see the prompt to switch until it was too late :/ Looked it up online because I didn't want to replay through it because I didn't want to mess up my ammo / herb count (I assume it works the same way it does on RE5 anyway - where your ammo/herbs carry over if you go back).   Barry's campaign was neat but a little boring and way too short to me. The boss was a joke, I shot her (I assume it was the daughter of the Russian guy - that's how I read into the journals anyway) with the magnum a few times and she died... I was sad at how easy it was. It was amusing however when Barry complained about hurting himself if he tried carrying the power supply all the way to the elevator... when I was forcing Natalia to carry it the entire time. It amused me watching the little girl struggle to carry it everywhere... One thing that did annoy me though was I missed the upgraded sniper, I shot it down and knew where it was - but I didn't see how to get to it until I already had the power supply up at the elevator. Turns out you cannot drop the power supply back down and instead your character refuses to walk over to the edge while carrying the power... So I'm pretty annoyed about that but it was my own fault for not seeing it soon - but the fact that you couldn't drop that down a ledge was frustrating.   Overall it was a really fun episode, but again I thought Barry's campaign was a bit lackluster and way too easy and a bit short this time around... but since Claire's was so long it kinda makes up for it."

residentevil,2yvuiz,BlamemyPhone,2,Fri Mar 13 14:32:01 2015 UTC,"Spoilers obviously.  I liked Claire's part. The puzzles with the uncomfortable hints on the walls, and the Prometheus references. I also loved how long it was compared to the other chapters. A good boss fight in the end as well. I actually sort of felt bad for Neil, despite his actions.   But Barry's to me, wasn't as good as his last two episodes. I was saddened by the russian guy and his journal, and loved the segment where barry gave natalia a piggyback through the sewers. But apart from that, it wasn't as intense as Claire's part. The mini-boss fight was underwhelming, and simply adding more revenants to the end fight didn't do much for me, especially after getting the new sniper rifle."

I climbed up the ladder, killed some things, and then there was another ladder leading down on the other side. I sprinted towards it, angling left, hoping to jump down - I did, but I jumped through the wall also, into the mountain, and then fell far below the map.

residentevil,2yrmsp,XantheDread,2,Thu Mar 12 05:47:46 2015 UTC,"The game keeps track of whether or not the levels have had their medals earned, and which characters have done it. The silver medals next to the level in the menu mean they have been earned with someone. If they're gold, then they've been earned with whichever character you're currently using.  Your placing on the Medallion Leaderboard counts all of the medals you've earned with every character, but to unlock characters and stages, it only counts the medals from each level once.  You might also notice the medals sparkling. If they don't sparkle, it means that you used a life crystal when you completed that level."
residentevil,2yrmsp,LexCrunch,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:23:13 2015 UTC,Is there any particular reason to clear and get gold/gold sparkling medals with EVERY character or is it just there for overall leader board stuff? I can't imagine they would pad out the Raid Mode content with something as trivial as that.  I mean if I run through with a character and get all gold/gold shining medals on every stage I should effectively unlock everything that Raid Mode has to offer in regards to the medal unlock sysytem (at least thats what I feel it should do). It would be crazy if you could only unlock EVERYTHING by getting all the medals with EVERY character.
residentevil,2yrmsp,LexCrunch,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"You'll unlock everything if you run through with just one character. Running through with more characters is just for personal achievement, or to buff them up enough to inherit a unique skill to another character that you prefer."
residentevil,2yrmsp,ikarikh,2,Thu Mar 12 21:41:02 2015 UTC,"You can change your chars level on the deploy screen by hitting Square.  So if you have a level 30 Hunk but need to be below 15 to get a medal on a level, you can drop Hunk down to 15 for that level then jump back to 30.  So you don't ""need"" to use other chars to accomplish that."
residentevil,2yrmsp,GarethMagis,2,Fri Mar 13 03:23:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's fairly alarming that it took so long for someone to post this. The poor guy seems to have replayed a ton of the same missions yet again with a new character just because no one informed him he can adjust his level."
residentevil,2yrmsp,Pinkmushroomlover,-1,Fri Mar 13 06:46:03 2015 UTC,It would be beneficial for you to all 5 medals on one character. That's how you unlock the raid mode characters that require X number of completion medals.   I also believe that's how you unlock more stages in raid mode. (Aside from finishing the campaign) You need a certain amount of medals on one character.   Tl;dr get all medals on one character
residentevil,2yrmsp,MightyPigeon,2,Thu Mar 12 07:04:03 2015 UTC,"You don't actually need all medals on one character, its just XX ""unique"" completion medals for the character unlocks.

Also burns the tentacles off that monster with the big weak spot in the middle, of course.  The force bullets literally just move the enemy back a few inches every time you shoot them. It's never been particularly useful for me, but maybe if you put it in a full-auto weapon, it would work well.  I think ice is strong against fire enemies, and it slows all enemies down, but yeah, way less useful than fire ammo.  And electric ammo... I have no idea why it exists"

residentevil,2ykkwh,Hydelol,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:15:13 2015 UTC,I don't have an issue at all but I switched from the default crosshairs to the RE4-esque laser pointer and  I definitely like that better.  Give it a go maybe?
residentevil,2ykkwh,BearpunchGunsmoke,0,Tue Mar 10 18:43:58 2015 UTC,"I tried that, but the laser sucks. It disappears when you fire, and takes a second to show up when you start aiming.  Though someone else suggested that the game calculates aim with a left or right bias dependent on distance as the laser does, which could be right, but would be really stupid since RE6 altered bullet behavior based on aiming styles, and I'd have expected the same treatment. I'll experiment with them more and find out if it's on the right track."
residentevil,2ykkwh,BearpunchGunsmoke,3,Tue Mar 10 18:58:37 2015 UTC,Really?  Resident evil feels really weird without a laser sight.  Just me I guess.  Yeah I've been treating it that way since I got the game.  I wasn't actually aware RE6 corrected bullets.  That's interesting.
residentevil,2ykkwh,chofortu,1 point,Tue Mar 10 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"I was fine with the lasers when you were planted to the spot when aiming. Now that you can move and shoot, it just feels really clumsy.  In RE6, the bullets actually spawn out of the perfect center of the screen for the first shot every time if you have the crosshair on instead. The advantage to the laser is that there is less walk when you fire your weapons quickly. Unfortunately, I don't think Revs 2 makes that distinction."

residentevil,2ykkwh,Jabnin,-2,Tue Mar 10 18:59:28 2015 UTC,Why would you use an xbox controller on PC?
residentevil,2ykkwh,Unifizz,3,Tue Mar 10 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"Using a keyboard and mouse for a third person game is as dumb as using a controller for a first person game (since in first person aiming is the most important thing, and you're not going to be aiming any better than with a mouse) If you're asking why XBone controller specifically it's because xinput automatically works if you have your device plugged in for any game that supports it, which is most these days. I like Dualshock 2, but the Dualshock 3 has those dumb paddles on the back."
residentevil,2ykkwh,Jabnin,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"Just curious why you think KB+M is dumb for a 3rd person game? I can't stand using controllers for any shooters, I find aiming a million times easier with KB + M"
residentevil,2ykkwh,zzzzNNNN,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:42:58 2015 UTC,"Aiming, yes. But movement, no. The freedom of movement the left analogue stick provides is equal to the precision of aiming the mouse provides. And since aiming isn't quite as important in third person games as it is in first, I strongly prefer a controller."
residentevil,2ygga8,ElSpank,6,Mon Mar 9 16:46:57 2015 UTC,Something I sketched up after finishing Rev. 2 Episode 2.  The number of Kafka references in this game are insane. This is probably true of all Resident Evil titles but I haven't really played one since RE:4; which is long due a replay.
residentevil,2ygga8,mash-,2,Mon Mar 9 16:48:58 2015 UTC,This is really neat! And imo you're not really missing much in terms of gameplay/fun between 4 and Rev2.  Edit: I did enjoy Rev1 somewhat.
residentevil,2ygga8,mash-,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:42:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comment! I'm tempted to get RE6 since I hear it is similar to Revelations in terms of it being a bit more action oriented but I'm all about Revelations 2 right now. This is the only game to truly inspire me since Dark Souls II came out.
residentevil,2yjlfz,thedude2618,3,Tue Mar 10 10:14:33 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Misread the post and re-wrote my comment.  If I remember right you can unlock other weapons by maxing out the first version of each weapon type, so it's definitely worth upgrading those so you can unlock those bonus weapons.  I know you unlock a burst fire pistol after fully upgrading the very first pistol in the game.   You unlock a minigun for Chris if you fully upgrade the first machine gun.  You unlock a longbow for Sheva by fully upgrading the first sniper.  You unlock a REALLY powerful magnum by fully upgrading the first magnum.  I can't remember if you unlock anything for upgrading the first shotgun. You unlock the Hydra which is a triple barreled shotgun if you fully upgrade the first shotgun.  As far as I remember there aren't any terribly bad weapons, though you should probably disregard the old version of your weapon once you find the next version of it.  Since you mentioned you like your headshots, you should upgrade the Critical damage on the pistols, I believe that either increases headshot damage in general, or gives you more of a chance to instantly decapitate normal majini with one headshot.  For Machine Guns, they understandably won't do that much damage per shot but make up for it by being fast firing so I'd probably suggest going for damage mainly and capacity.  For Shotguns I'd go for damage, then reload speed and possibly the Critical upgrade on that as well.  For Magnums, go for damage (obviously due to their already considerable power, more damage makes them good for dealing with mini bosses) and Piercing, so you can funnel Majini into one small opening and kill multiple enemies with one shot.  I hope I've been helpful, I'm sure someone else probably has better advice than me on here but I hope this was a good start :) Good luck and have fun!"
residentevil,2yjlfz,Nightcore50,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:26:43 2015 UTC,"Seems like good advice, thanks.  I'm going to fully commit to upgrading the 1st pistol and shotgun and probably pick up the MP5 too and just not bother upgrading it. I'll use it as backup."
residentevil,2yjlfz,SisterBubbles,2,Tue Mar 10 11:53:21 2015 UTC,"I've allways thought that the MP5 get undeserved hatred. I like the fact that one mag contains 150 rounds once fully upgraded, if you aim right, that can take care of a whole horde on hard difficulty. Also, the minigun is pretty useless, it sprays like hell (i remember my friend having it and only getting a 40% hit stat). Myself, i'm a sucker for the longbow, i one-hits every regular mob on hard difficulty and two-hits on proffessional. Regarding the Hydra, it's good, but only available for Sheva."
residentevil,2yjlfz,LordNoe,3,Tue Mar 10 14:30:28 2015 UTC,"Chris can use the Hydra too. In fact, he fires it one handed!"
residentevil,2yjlfz,SisterBubbles,2,Tue Mar 10 14:52:34 2015 UTC,Say what!? This must be investigated!
residentevil,2yjlfz,Laalipop,3,Tue Mar 10 14:54:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, full on Dante shooting with it."
residentevil,2yjlfz,Mechanized_Ghost,2,Tue Mar 10 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"There are no truly terrible weapons in the game.   The SIG P226 is a very powerful non magnum sidearm, doing 480 damage once fully upgraded while using normal pistol ammunition. 4 shots of the P226 = 1 shot from the S75. 6 shots = ~1 magnum shot. It also comes with Piercing upgrades, meaning you can punch through multiple heads with a single shot.  I suggest buying a few of those and upgrading them to the max possible, and you'll find your life will be a lot easier and ammo efficient.  For SMGs, I suggest sticking with the Scorpion, due to the 300 round magazine when fully upgraded and the increased chance of critical hits you can do.  Shotguns tend to vary, and on pure power you'll be hard pressed to beat the Hydra, unlocked by fully upgrading the Ithaca. The Benelli M3 offers much higher ammo capacity than the Hydra while retaining 900 damage per shot, and is my go-to shotgun if you need a good balance between ammunition and damage.  As for magnums, pick whichever one you like most. You're unlikely to use them against more than a single powerful target, so ammunition and piercing statistics don't matter as much as damage.  Oddity items include the Bow, which is fun to use (even more fun with no crosshair) and does a fair bit of damage, and the stun rod, which can be used to make some fights a lot easier.  This is info from about twenty or so Professional runs I did over the course of a year, so the stats are valid for the highest difficulty and ammo conservation."
residentevil,2yjlfz,Mechanized_Ghost,2,Tue Mar 10 15:45:53 2015 UTC,"Any of the common Manjini that sprout the snakelike appendage from their head can be killed with the stunrod without ever sprouting the parasites.  You can stun some of the bosses(Wesker on the ship, the six legged insect with the instakill animation), though you better be good at QTEs."
residentevil,2yjlfz,kikaider007,2,Tue Mar 10 19:40:58 2015 UTC,"Carrying more than one weapon type is a waste of inventory space, Keep that in mind.  I found that the best load out for your characters depends on how you want to play.  Since you like head shots they play as chris and your friend as sheva.  I found this load out to be the most versatile and speeds up the process of getting the other guns you can buy after upgrading the basic ones.  Chris - 92sf (Upgrade this gun first and foremost), Ithica shotgun (Upgrade this one second), and grenade launcher.  Sheva - Scorpion smg (Upgrade this third), s75 rifle, and the dirty harry magnum.  This load out balances your firepower and inventory space while the upgrades lead you to having the guns with the most ammo capacity but also closer to unlocking the other guns you need to buy.  If you ever play with unlimited ammo then go with this load out and you will have no trouble.  Play as sheva (the aiming animation for the hydra with chris is annoying) take the hydra shotgun and the psg 1 sniper rifle and your partner the s&w 500."

residentevil,2yftq9,BPRoberts,2,Mon Mar 9 16:50:34 2015 UTC,"One in the main tunnel. That section of the game is fairly small, so even if you're paranoid about saving you shouldn't use more than two ribbons. Once you clear that you're back in the mansion again on a new route, which almost immediately has one. Again, not a very long section, no reason to save more than once. Once you leave the mansion the final time after that, the last area (which is maybe half the size of the mansion, if that) has two IIRC. As another poster mentioned, there's also quite a few loose ones hanging around. Have you gotten the one in the small room off the main hall yet?"
residentevil,2yftq9,Sissle,3,Mon Mar 9 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"There are also hidden ink ribbons scattered throughout the game. Check coats and jackets hanging on coat racks or on hooks, some have ink ribbons in them."

residentevil,2yeiyh,wrathborne,3,Mon Mar 9 02:58:49 2015 UTC,"I felt like they kinda skimped on the melee attacks in general. Like everyone has the ""boot to the back, spine stab"" stealth kill animation, whereas I was expecting at least Hunk to have his old neck snap. There also aren't as many different melee attacks as I though there would be. I'm fine with not having the crazy amount there were in RE5 & 6, but something along the lines of RE4 with a couple kick variations and a suplex.   I also agree about the characters feeling the same. They all start off a bit differently, like Hunk starting with all his weapon slots open but very few skills, Moira having one weapon but more melee skills, etc, but it's not really enough. Granted, the unique active skills are there, but even those can be shared later so everything ends up being cosmetic. There should be some more differences like speed, knockback distance or something that will always be unique to that character."
residentevil,2yeiyh,jaggular,2,Mon Mar 9 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"I would have liked Moira to keep her crowbar finisher from the main game, and had a melee attack that utilized it as well. Would have made her stand out more.  I think that each character should have a set melee attack strength, while it is something that could be upgraded certain characters should always deal more damage and be more proficient with melee.  Just like some characters should be better with certain kinds of weapons, no matter what how many times you upgrade Barry would always reload and fire a Magnum faster than any other class. Doesn't have to be an insane difference in speed and fire rate but it should always be present with him.  Same could be done with damage resistances, or HP. Barry would have more HP than Claire and take -10% fire damage, but Claire could also take -20% shock damage, and have a faster recovery time when knocked down by an attack.  Things like this would really shake things up in the character roster and make certain stages more challenging depending on the character."

The major difference between characters is there bottle weapons, none of them are especially effective.  Jill has an RPG but it's not much better than two or three magnum shots to the head.  There's not enough variety between characters, and even though weapon scale to the character when I've got level 8 damage, STARS, BSAA and high level elemental on lvl a 5 character it's too easy.  I'm not emotionally invested in Gina or Pedro or any of the other new characters, and Cypher takes too damn long to kill anything.  I wish Melee was a bigger component."

That is why RE1DC is my personal #1. The REmake adds so much to the first game that I just have to place it as #2. The addition of Crimson Heads gives the player more choices to make. Not only do you waste ammo from killing zombies, but they will come back stronger than before. One of the big things that modern horror titles lack is giving the player options, and having consequences/after-effects of those actions.  Resident Evil 2 is a great game and an amazing sequel, but I prefer the scenario design of REmake, 1 and 3. In 2 you have four main scenarios with slight custscene/story differences throughout, but each scenario is the same every time you play them. REmake, 1, and 3 feel more dynamic. Those have about the same amount of differences as 2, but the player is in control of it all. 2 decided to string together all of the differences in separate linear scenarios instead of letting the player have impact on what happens. There are only 2-3 small things the player can control throughout RE2. On the other hand I could go on and on about the player controlled differences in REmake, 1, and 3.  Code Veronica is one hell of a game in terms of length. It felt tedious at times but overall it was an enjoyable experience. It was done in a similar style of 2 with a more 'linear' path. Whereas 2 and 3 were more serious (and rightfully so), CVX brought back some of the silliness of the first game.  I don't want to tout Revelations as a true return-to-form, because it's not, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. The ship segments with Jill are my favorite thing from the TPS-REs. It was a small step in the right direction despite the other 2/3 of the game where you play as Parker, Quint, and Keith. Raid mode is fun if not a grindfest.   Zero might be a bit higher on my list if it had item boxes.  The character-zap system was a nice touch and I'm glad to see it return in Revelations 2.  RE4 and RE5 are fairly similar in my eyes. There are bits that I don't like from either game so it's hard for me to decide which I like more. Total reliance on co-op made RE5 single player a drag, but co-op made the game fun. The Lost in Nightmares DLC was great, too. The village section of 4 is atmospheric but after that the game becomes as linear and lame as 5.  It's hard for me to talk about the Outbreak series. I played them and enjoyed them, but I never had a chance to experience the multiplayer aspect of these games.  UC / DC: I'm not a big fan of rail shooters but these games are cool for the story aspects alone. I wouldn't mind seeing another that retells 4 / 5 / 6 but it's not really necessary.   The scenarios in 6 didn't excite me in the slightest. If I had to rate them it would look something like: Leon/Helena > Ada > Jake/Sherry > Chris/Piers. The camera in this game makes me sick (literally). I can only play it for about 20 minutes at a time without getting a headache. Why is everything a QTE?  Haven't played Dead Aim or Survivor 2. I plan to get Dead Aim eventually and will probably play Survivor 2 on emulator at some point (since it never officially released in my region).  As far as where I would like the series to go: would it kill them to make the games less linear? I really dislike the chapter system in most modern games. Chapter systems say ""the player can only visit points A and B"" in C chapter, no exploration allowed! I miss the days where the entire game felt connected.   Even Revelations 2 is guilty of this. Every time you enter a new 'segment' of the game you get a fade-to-black screen that cuts you off from exploring previous areas. It's like you can see Capcom's storyboard of the game within the game itself! ""This is the segment where the player does X thing"" ""This is the segment where the player does Y puzzle"" ""This is the segment where player fights Z enemy""."
residentevil,2ydkhc,Krusiv,0,Sun Mar 8 22:52:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the list, interesting read!  I agree with nearly everything you said, though I put priority on different games for slightly different reasons.  One of the reasons I don't like Revelations 2, it feels like it's trying to be horror, but it isn't scary, and it's not fun enough to be action. It also removed the exploration from Revelations 1.  While the first game, had some highly atmospheric parts, a return to exploration the environments were interesting as well (the game was linear, but it still had exploration and puzzles to a light degree, which is props in my books) and I found it alot of fun.  Also Norman is one of the best final Resident Evil bosses, IMO, massive props, it was atmospheric, tough, great music, and he had an interesting design, it wasn't some gigantic tentacle creature."
residentevil,2ydkhc,LexCrunch,2,Sun Mar 8 23:23:50 2015 UTC,"Is this a favorites list? I'm not about to do a write-up, but I'll play with the ones you listed and respond to feedback if any.   Resident Evil 2 Resident Evil 6 Resident Evil 5 Resident Evil 3 Resident Evil Revelations Resident Evil 0 Resident Evil REmake Resident Evil 4 Resident Evil Code: Veronica Resident Evil 1   I won't count Revs 2 since it's not fully out yet. It'll probably squeeze itself between 5 and 3 for me once it's done, though; I'm very much enjoying it."
residentevil,2ydkhc,LexCrunch,2,Sun Mar 8 23:57:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding, and yea it's pretty much a favourites list. I'm curious why you enjoyed 6 and 5 more than 4? Not judging just curious, I didn't really hate either, RE5 is a great action game with co-op IMO."
residentevil,2ydkhc,LexCrunch,2,Mon Mar 9 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"I liked RE4, don't get me wrong, but I see 5 as almost the exact same game, only better (unless you're forced into playing with the AI).   Inventory, including item pickups, is in real time to keep up the pace of the game and inject new and exciting tactics. Having to pause the game every time you want to switch weapons or play Tetris with your briefcase irks me every time. You can aim with the camera before aiming with your gun to point at what you want more quickly (RE4 had this, but not as well developed as in 5) The new control scheme gives you better control of your aim and actions There are more melee attacks based on where you target the enemy, further building on one of the aspects that made RE4 stand out The Mercenaries bonus game is leagues better with the inclusion of time bonuses for melee kills and a co-op mode. You can't just mow down beasties for a high score. You have to know how much damage they can take and how many bullets from which guns to which targets will set them up to die to which next melee from which character. It's very involved.   As for 6, it's kind of its own monster. Once you get the hang of the game, it becomes a very engaging third person shooter; my favorite in the genre, in fact. At its highest level, you're always doing or keeping track of something. Micromanaging goons in Mercenaries to get the counter kill on as many as possible without accidentally killing them with bullets for the biggest time bonus is extremely engrossing. I also really liked the complexity of the new melee mechanics. It decided that we're done pretending to try and be scary and went all out action, and I appreciate that. As much as I'd love to see a new game in the style of the old days, it was nice to see it fully transition into and develop a new identity instead of being stuck between two different ones. As a full on action game, it did a really really good job."
residentevil,2ydkhc,norifumi155,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yea, I can fully agree with you on that, I think the reason I rated RE5 lower is because I played it so much till I just grew bitter of the game, though the first run through with my brother and I on coop was very fun.  I admittedly haven't put too much time into RE6, I never really had anyone to play it with, so that kinda diminishes the coop fun aspect.  Though as for the RE4 and 5s menus, I vastly preferred RE4s I loved to sort everything and keep it all compact and organised, RE5s kept you in the action which I enjoyed as well, but it didn't have the same complexities.  Oh, and REmake was really far down on your list, I imagine from waht you didn't like of RE4, you didn't like having to manage the inventories and boxes?  How'd you feel about having to burn corpses and worry about Crimson Heads? Personally, I thought that was sinhlr handedly the greatest contribution to the series, where enemies are scarier after they're dead."
residentevil,2ydkhc,GeneLim,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:46:22 2015 UTC,"I don't blame you. RE5 is a chore in single player, but a total blast in co-op. I've honestly never enjoyed a co-op game as much as I have RE5. RE6's co-op is really fun as well, yet the AI is invincible and doesn't chew through your reserve of supplies, so playing single player is just fine.  REmake is only that far down the list because I prefer so many more. I love it, it's a brilliant and beautiful game deserving of great praise, but it's just so much slower than the old Playstation installments, so replaying it isn't as much of a joy to me. I also really like having secret and/or difficult tech in the game that potentially dramatically changes the flow of the game, and REmake just didn't have anything quite on the level of the first three in that regard. Those games have an I think three-frame link that you can pull off to shoot your guns faster, and I absolutely adore that. A lot of future installments made reference to or somewhat incorporated similar tricks, but it was never quite the same.  As for crimson heads, I hardly if ever noticed them. Every time I played the game, I was such a stickler for ammo that I just learned to avoid everything instead, which as it turned out was also the fastest way through the game, so going back and speeding through it later didn't change much for me. On paper, though, I think it's a brilliant concept.  On the subject of the inventory, I don't at all mind the old style inventory. It makes routing the game very interesting, and keeps you from carrying an entire arsenal and a hospital with you going in blind. I only hate it in 4 because it's an action game, and stopping the flow for up to three minutes to dump, flip, twist and sort your inventory is just a royal pain. The switch to 5's inventory was also great because in addition to being able to switch weapons immediately, it added a quickshot trick and brought back the inventory combine reload trick from the old games, but in a new setting, so melee attacks were even further encouraged to give you an invincible moment to instantly reload all your weapons and keep you in the action. Everything about it made the game more exciting."

Having me be there to kill people and let her run around and find items really saves a lot of time. Also, the scare factor is still there despite it being co-op, because it really makes one person rely on the other (Moira blinding enemies/ Natalia seeing invisible enemies) I guess it really depends on who you're playing with, because a more experience player would want to be activley killing instead of being a support.

I don't mind it at all. I mostly play as Moria and except against bosses she can hold her own. I kill most enemies with the crowbar. I do switch to kill enemies with Barry, but I enjoy it. I've only played RE5 co op. I don't like co op. Split screen blows. Online play is ok, but I usually just play alone. I like to do things at my own speed. I don't mind partners. They give me back up. Sure it takes the scare factor down,  but it'd nice to have someone watch my back while reloading.  I agree. Claire is awesome, but this story could have done without her,  and if they were going for a scarier game they should have left out partners. However,  out of any character Claire fits in best. Barry and Chris were close, so it makes sense that he would know Claire. So, when Moira joins TerraSave it would sense that Claire would be there to guide her."

residentevil,2ycceq,wolfdwnyourfood,6,Sun Mar 8 15:45:50 2015 UTC,The best experience is a fresh experience.  The only tip I give is be very conservative with your ammo. You probably want to avoid as many creatures as you can instead of killing them.   Ammo is not abundant like in the future more action-oriented instalments.
residentevil,2ycceq,MythicIV,0,Sun Mar 8 15:35:20 2015 UTC,If you are playing on easy or normal there is plenty of ammo and you can pretty much kill everything in the game and still have some left over (as long as you save your heavy weapons for bosses and end game).  You do have a point though because certain areas its really easy to dodge enemies or where you only have to go through a room once so you don't have to worry about wasting any shots.
residentevil,2ycceq,mastershake04,5,Mon Mar 9 21:10:35 2015 UTC,"""Stack"" dead bodies as much as possible. Have a kill pile in rooms with multiple zombies so that you only need to use one charge of flask to burn them. The torso of the bodies need to overlap in order to count as ""stacked"""

residentevil,2ycceq,theLEVIATHAN06,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"Conserve your ammo. There's enough throughout the game to kill every enemy, but at the beginning, conservation is crutial, as you'll encounter more enemies than there are ammunition pickups. Especially so if you're playing on Mountain Climbing instead of Hiking.  If you drop an enemy, keep an eye for if they bleed out. If they do, then their down for good. If not, then their faking you out.   If you have the knife and you're the type who keeps it at all times, then use it to drop enemies by stabbing their knees, and stab them when they're down. This is useful if you're low or out of ammo, or if you just want to save ammo.  If you down a zombie, don't think they're done for. If you blew their heads off, then you're good. If you didn't, you may want to think about burning the bodies with the kerosene from one of the safe rooms. Otherwise, they can be a problem later on, because they can turn into Crimson Heads, which are faster, stronger, and all around mother fuckers. Not as tough as some other monsters later on, but they're up there. Also, be aware that Kerosene canisters are held generally in save rooms, but they are limited.  In some rooms, like the L shaped hallway on the ground floor, there are some drawers which aren't part of the environment. These can be moved, and may hide ammo and defense items underneath.  I suggest starting with Jill instead of Chris. Jill has 8 pockets to Chris' 6, and Jill has a lockpick, while Chris needs to search for old keys. The only benefit that Chris has is (I believe) he can take more damage than Jill.  A personal tip. I would suggest not mixing blue herbs with green and red herbs. Blue herbs cures poison, while green ones heal damage. It may be beneficial to mix them if you're in an area full of poisonous enemies, but otherwise, using the mixture just to heal wounds would waste the blue herb.  This is all I can think of, but these are helpful for any pre-RE4 Resident Evil game for the most part. Otherwise, just go through it like you did with Code: Veronica."

residentevil,2ycceq,JohnnyPsychotic,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:00:56 2015 UTC,I'll give you one simple piece of advice that I see people getting wrong.  Save the self defense gun for the first tyrant fight and use that and the shotgun to win that fight and toss the s.d.g. in the box and forget about it.
residentevil,2ycceq,kikaider007,0,Wed Mar 11 14:38:40 2015 UTC,"I found Code Veronica tougher than REmake, I don't see why you're having much trouble :O  Though just dodge, conserve amm.  I try to kill the zombies I know I'll go by alot, and will have. Yough time dodging, and I try to save after every few key items I get. Don't save unless you make some progress"
residentevil,2ycceq,DivineEmbers,2,Sun Mar 8 17:47:02 2015 UTC,Well I played it for about 30 minutes; while I didn't run into anything particularly difficult the game feels more daunting than Code Veronica.  I think it's the combination of the spooky atmosphere and the rather disorienting size of the mansion (i got lost rather quickly; so many different puzzle items lying around) that made me kinda freak out and come here.
residentevil,2ycceq,DivineEmbers,2,Sun Mar 8 17:56:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, then definitely I can see where you're coming from, the REmake seems small, but it's so filled with content and secrets you'd never know.  Just keep exploring, save every once and awhile after you make some progress with key items. Dodge, run around, or use defensive items.  For zombies you encounter often, blow their head off with a shotgun, or kill them then burn their corpse IMMEDIATELY"
residentevil,2ycceq,thatoneguy721,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:25:45 2015 UTC,"I've seen other people say this, but play as Jill first. Find your save rooms. Pick up every item, and keep your box organized. If you don't cheat or use a guide re 1 can be most difficult. Take everything slow. Don't run unless you need to. Learn the mansion. Memorize it. In remake defense items are your friends. Burn every zombie you kill. If you must use your shotgun aim up and get head shots."

Activate the switch and have the other character run thru. On the other side of the gate there is a pushable block. Push the block forward so it blocks the path of the sliding door. This might take two activations of the switch. After its blocked open have your second character climb over the box to the exit door. The door will remain blocked for Barry and he can skip that whole section."

residentevil,2yau4k,Snark88,10,Sun Mar 8 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"I think the story should be single player, with a second campaign that is co-op. Ashley was near perfect; her voice was just annoying, and she was jack-shit useless. However, her uselessness and vulnerability made the game harder and scarier. RE7 is going to need to change the formula. All these games are becoming way too similar. One of the things they need to change is definitely co-op. The current system just is not okay."

residentevil,2yau4k,EQUASHNZRKUL,1 point,Sun Mar 8 05:32:06 2015 UTC,"The thing which made Ashley work was that she seemed to be designed around making the game harder and more intense, giving the player more to worry and think about. Every other partner system in the later games are designed to compensate/make the situation easier. That and Ashley was only around for about 30-40% of the game, so it never felt intrusive."
residentevil,2yau4k,tiger66261,2,Sun Mar 8 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"I'm happy that Revelations 1 had chunks of the game where you went solo, but I do miss being partnerless in a RE game."
residentevil,2yau4k,wrathborne,3,Sun Mar 8 04:36:51 2015 UTC,"Partnering famous characters is a bad idea too.  Many fans dont want their favorite character to be outshined. Imagine the feminist Jill fans who will get mad if their favorite character is turned into a sidekick to Chris.   Did you know in 6 Many Sherry fans got mad that she is just a sidekick to Jake when she is the returning character and not Jake.   Also the people you call throw away characters can be promoted if given a chance.   Look Barry started as a Partner character and now he is lead. There is a growing movement to promote Rebecca because some people are sick of Chris, Leon and Ada.   That is the reason why Barry and Claire are not partners, Many fans dont want their favorite to be a sidekick.  About the throw away characters, they can be promoted if given a chance.  Seriously Chris, Leon and Ada needs a Hiatus so bad."
residentevil,2yau4k,IhatePTC,3,Sun Mar 8 08:16:13 2015 UTC,"They need to stop relying on old characters so much. It's a bad habit they started with in 3 and have not been able to break.   We didn't know the characters in RE1 or RE2 yet we managed to give a shit about them, because of context, characterization and empathy. It seems like Capcom is terrified of trying to create a new character because they're afraid the audience won't care."

I think Barry's promotion is a good decision and he is originally seen as a throwaway character"
residentevil,2yau4k,IhatePTC,2,Sun Mar 8 18:45:26 2015 UTC,"I really quite enjoy the co-op part. Co-Op is rarely scary, but its fun ,and I like it.  I think it can be scary when your surrounded by hordes of enemies and you have no ammo and you and your partner are panicking. The opening of RE5 with the Axeman is a great example.  It only really bothers me when the partner is underwritten or annoying. Sheva and Moira and Natalie feel like real characters to me, but Piers, Helena, Parker? Already forgotten. Adult Sherry was just weird.  I think having to protect Ashley made the game scarier, in a way. The switching to Moira/Natalie is very annoying. I dislike it.  Co-Op story is one of the reasons I stick with RE as a series. I think fighting zombies with a friend can be good fun, but I absolutely understand why you don't like it.  For my money, I'd rather they got rid of Raid mode, had a single player campaign, but added a co-op side story, like Seperate Ways."
residentevil,2yau4k,HobbieK,2,Sun Mar 8 03:30:07 2015 UTC,"I loved having two stories to play through in the earlier games.  The games just aren't scary when you've got someone to talk to, watching your back, patching you up.  Instead if switching between characters I'd rather play separate stories where you spend some time w/ a partner and time alone.  Moira/Natalia are nearly useless except for specific tasks and better eyesight.  Why Claire can't carry a crowbar is stupid.  Natalia is only useful because there's a stupid invisible bugmonster that can 1 hit you.  I would mind them less of they were imperiled more often."

I'm enjoying Rev2, but it all feels so tired. I've done all of it before, not just in RE but in all the games that have imitated it (and surpassed it) since RE4. The staleness of these games is diminishing Resident Evil's relevance as a brand. They need to lose the MT Framework engine and move on to bigger and better things, and at the very least, make co-op optional if it has to be in. RE can be a lot of fun co-op, but there's no need to have a persistent partner when you're going solo, because you're right, it does take you out of it."

Old Resident Evil used to have me on my toes all the time. Entering a door and hear a hunter ""fuck fuck fuck. NOPE!"".   Now it's like ""heh, the AI will take care of it"". I mean, I beat last boss from RE5 by giving a sniper to the AI  and let her kill Wesker. All I did was walk around avoinding being hit.  In the end my biggest issue is the one you point out. Being alone is a lot more scary than having someone else with you, it's not immersive at all, doesn't give you a psychological fear. I want that feeling of being afraid of not making through the next room. The first times in the first games i didnt have enough ink ribbons to get me going."

I'm not somebody who wants the games to remain perpetually set in RE1/2 but I do think those early games did something right in terms of atmosphere and feel that has been lost in the more recent Co-op dominant titles."

Because I could just tell Barry to wait while I use Natalie to scout the area first. I was playing on normal difficulty though, not sure if she can die on the hardest difficulty or not. Also not sure if Moira can die or not, but she also regenerates back her health.  To be honest, I would have preferred to be alone in Rev 2. Especially in Rev 2, because the levels are all pretty damn creepy this time around, unlike RE5 or RE6. Having a buddy there, even an A.I. buddy made it less scary."
residentevil,2yau4k,iash91,1 point,Sun Mar 8 15:41:24 2015 UTC,"I think they can make both types of games, with coop and without. The important thing to me is to design games around the fact that there is or isn't coop. I wouldn't make a single-player game the same way I would make a coop game."
residentevil,2yau4k,apollonius2x,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:00:05 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree, and kind of don't. Capcom really need to modernise their co-op. If you're playing single player, always make sure you're the only character at a time (minus the random char following you bits that RE has always had), but if you choose co-op, then have a character follow you. Make the cutscenes accommodate both characters rather then just one, which single player would have. Admittedly, I don't play many single player games unless they REALLY grab me (like tomb raider, max payne 3, etc) so co-op is always a welcomed option. But I agree, if you're playing single player, make it a single player experience."

Back with re 1 to 3 i wish i had a partner but it was to play with friends and i never  understood why they always split up like in re2 with leon and claire.  They found each other and split up again the main mission from atart was to ge4 together and get out of the  town but tyey didnt.  Anyway i hate the ai.  I dont mind a having a partner.  But i hate they are so stupid.  U can go up a ladder a zombie come and the ai runs away and gets hit all the time and wont go upp the ladder.  Its so freaking annoying.  Why cant the  partner  try to dodge zombies?  I mean no one im real life would stand with a torch and let monsters hit them its so retarded i hate it and how  they get stuck everywhere.  I  rather have 2 modes one alone and one woth coop but i always hate if the coop is not the main story like most  games do. But rather have 2main stories. Maybe have one where  u need  a partner to get to but if u alone  u will  find a key etc so u have the same story but different pathways to go.

He didn't know what he would become, but he wanted to accomplish his plan at any cost.  Sergei Vladimir injected himself with the t-Virus because he was an adapter, wanted to kill the superhuman Wesker and could retain his consciousness, just at the cost of his body (this goes for anyone infected with the dominant species Plaga too).  Albert Wesker absorbed the Uroboros Virus because he lost his previous superhuman abilities and was an adapter able to control it, but he absorbed too much initially. He would've returned to human form over time.  Alexia Ashford was able to control the t-Veronica Virus completely, even going so far as to be able to return to human form at will. She maintained her consciousness and intelligence. You could say she succeeded where everyone else failed.  Javier Hidalgo merged with the Veronica Plant because he was desperately trying to get back his daughter and was filled with anger toward Leon and Krauser for taking her from him.

residentevil,2ya23j,ElSpank,5,Sat Mar 7 21:58:47 2015 UTC,"First thing I did was maximize magnum mastery on Barry in his early levels so other characters could inherit it. Even on harder difficulties, you have enough ammo there to take out every if not most of the enemies using only the magnum to one-shot them from any distance. Elites are more resilient, but that's what ammo pickups and other weapons are for.  Magnums are extremely overpowered. Abuse the heck out of them."
residentevil,2ya23j,LexCrunch,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:11:12 2015 UTC,Talking about that skill. I've just realised that the supposed capacity 369% at level 20 doesn't increase the bullet capacity of your weapon. Same goes for the other mastery skills; at any skill level.  EDIT: Just looked it up and it is the reserve ammo capacity that it increases. Should have guessed.
residentevil,2ya23j,LexCrunch,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:10:53 2015 UTC,"I went in with the same assumption before realizing three levels in what it was doing. I thought it upgraded the mag size, if only by a little bit, but it turned out to be the lower level characters scaling the stats of the same weapons I was using at higher levels. Somehow, I didn't think anything but damage was affected."
residentevil,2ya23j,LexCrunch,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:48:15 2015 UTC,"I managed to put doubt in my mind as to it's effectiveness after putting a capacity part on a weapon at the same time as upgrading the skill, making me think it was working. Pretty much pumped the skill to max anyway to see if it would 'upgrade again' at some point. I just assumed it would need max level to maybe get an extra +1 bullet out of it. Haha!  Now off to look up why I have the option to 'inherit' the skill I just maxed. I take it this means 'pass this skill on to other characters'. Honestly, some of the descriptions in this game are hilariously vague."

residentevil,2y9e7s,hikaeme,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:32:35 2015 UTC,"Are there any alternatives to farming levels to get skill points? Like lowering my effective level and playing on a higher level stage with upgraded weapons, would that give a decent amount of exp?"
residentevil,2y9e7s,hikaeme,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"Not that I've noticed. I've tried 3-5 on recommended level and 10 levels above and didn't really notice a difference. I could be wrong though since I haven't tried using a super lower leveled character, but I don't think it's worth the effort to struggle with meatsponges.   The best way to farm exp faster is to play split screen with two characters. Both characters get the same amount of points as if you were playing solo, and it doesn't matter if the 2nd character dies or not. Soul Eater on a weapon is useful.  There are certain raid rewards you can knock that give you 5sp for the character you achieve it on. ""That's My Fetish"" gives 10sp to all characters you currently have unlocked.  edit: Stages you haven't cleared before will give you extra exp, so there's that."
residentevil,2y9e7s,hikaeme,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:45:14 2015 UTC,"I need an extra controller to get the split screen right?  Repeating the same missions even with a higher level character is still viable for farming exp? Maybe at most 10 levels apart?   I should just use my best weapon parts. Currently all my weapons are as they come, some dropped with parts already built in. That should hopefully make some of those missions easier."
residentevil,2y9e7s,hikaeme,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. I dunno what platform you're playing on but for my PS3 I used my PSP and Fusa Gamepad, but I dunno if that's available for you. >.>  I've been doing V-06 on Very Hard with Moira from level 80-100 and I get over 70k each run. I've paired her characters from level 5 that seem to get 70k+ as well, so their level doesn't make exp any less. Makes me think the enemies in stages are at a set level with certain exp. The only time you may get less or more exp for partners is when they come out of Rest Mode.  The rewards I've unlocked so far for 5 SP are: Branching Out, Likes It Rough, Not on My Watch"
residentevil,2y9e7s,hikaeme,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:31:59 2015 UTC,I'm playing on PC. Maybe it isn't the levels vs stage difference. It might just be cause for some enemies I'm just not 100% certain how best to take them out. ie. Like the revenants I figured that it's best to use fire - but currently I don't really have a reliably high rate fire mod yet.  I guess I can keep doing what I'm already doing till I get more familiar with some of the BOWs with different and not so obvious weakspots.  Do you recommend that I keep my weapons on par with my highest level character + mods?
residentevil,2y9e7s,Corey307,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"Redid V-06 at recommended (68), enemies gave same amount of exp as level 100. Tried it at 58, died… but same amount of exp per enemy haha. Ended up getting less exp at recommended because I had to resort to using other weapons. There’s no bonus for getting a completion medal. The only time you get extra exp is when you clear the stage for the first time and you don’t even have to go for all medals, though genocide would be recommended, extra enemies for exp. The only benefit for completion medals is unlocking Cipher, who has a nice sword and taunt skill.  It's worth noting that enemies that are boosted by others are the same as elites, so they give more exp than regular enemies. In that case it's best to avoid killing the booster unless it's too difficult for you to handle.  Hmm, yeah, I don't really know much about techniques against monsters yet but I do use a high roller on revs. Just really nice to expose the weak spot.  Weapons scale down to character so it's better to have a high level weapon for your highest, but the important thing that matters is your parts, so the more parts on a weapon the better I'd say. You can trash your older weapons. Also always check the store for parts.  Things will get easier as you get better parts or inherit nice skills."

Even before the katana is leveled up it is really powerful since it has a huge reach, and dazes on the second swipe, then stuns on the third. What this means is you can go face to face on any monster that doesn't have an elemental buff on without having to pay much attention.  You can still go face to face with elemental monsters but unless you want to get insta-blown up at hight levels you do 2 swipes, evade, two swipes, evade combo.   Monsters with elemental and fast movement can still tear you up quiet easily... but apart fro those you can murder everything. Everything!"

residentevil,2y7wpi,Capt-Murphy,3,Sat Mar 7 06:22:11 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend to just play through the main series, which would be: Remake, 2, 3, Code Veronica, Zero, 4, 5 and 6.  You can play Revelations and Revelations 2 after RE 5, if you want to.  Zero takes place chronologically the first, but it was released at that point, so I'd recommend playing at the mentioned point. In my opinion, it doesn't really make a good first impression to the series as a whole, unlike the Remake. Also, Zero is currently only out on the Gamecube, so that might be a problem, although there is a very likely HD remaster coming.  You can get all games on the PS3, except Zero.  The spin-off games, so Survivors, Outbreaks and Chronicles are not essentially and can be skipped if they don't look appealing to you."
residentevil,2y7wpi,Zaeh,2,Sat Mar 7 15:00:28 2015 UTC,Zero is also available on Wii. I think it's a straight port.
residentevil,2y7wpi,bogart1,3,Sun Mar 8 21:48:33 2015 UTC,"In order of release (1 2 3 CVX Remake 0 4 5 6 Rev Rev2), definitely. Remake can be substituted for original RE1 if you don't feel like going through roughly the same game twice - they're not that comparable though, Remake is streets ahead of original ports of RE1. They're both worth playing though.   The only ones I'd skip are the Outbreaks.  With their online services shut down, it's impossible to get the best ending since certain endings are only available with character combinations you could only find online. That, and their continuity is heavily debated.   The first Gun Survivor though gets a shout out in the beginning of 0.  The Chronicles games are a mix of quick retellings of the games to get folks caught up and original stories which generally cover scenarios hinted at, or behind the scenes, but never expressly shown. For (spoiler free) instance, a new character in RE4 is revealed to have a past with someone, but that's his first appearance in the series. One of the Chronicles games has a scenario that goes into their history in greater detail, but there's also missions that are just basic recaps of other games in the main series.   The best platform depends on which game we're talking about. The best version of the first one is the PC version, due to its superior graphics and extra features. The Saturn version has additional features on top of that, but the graphics are considered the worst for its time.  If you have a DS, the DS port of RE1 is good, with puzzles and features that make good use of the touchscreen and microphone.  The graphics are somewhat washed out due to compression, but it's good enough for the ds.   For RE2 and 3, the best version for both is either the Dreamcast version or the SourceNext PC port, due to graphics and content.   Code: Veronica had an expanded port in the early 2000s known as Code: Veronica X with new plot elements and features. Recently, CVX (as well as RE4) was given an HD port to the PSN/XBLA.   RE4 was then ported to Steam and given a greater overhaul in terms of graphics, featuring new textures, GameCube lighting/effects, and running at 60 fps.   Remake was just given the same treatment, with a Steam port similar to RE4's.  0 is supposedly next for that same treatment as well.   RE5, either the PS3 or the PC version. PS3's Gold Edition comes with all the DLC on disc, but the PC version has an exclusive mode for Mercenaries, Nvidia 3D, and is about to be updated with the DLC from the consoles.   RE6 is, again, the PC version, again due to it's exclusive content for Mercenaries mode.   Revelations, any of the HD ports should all be equal, though the PC version obviously supports anti-aliasing, higher frame rates and resolutions.   Rev2, the console releases are likely the best right now, as the PC release had its coop gutted just before release. They're working on patching it back in, as far as I know.   As for side games, RE: Survivor/Gun Survivor, the best version is the European PS1 version, as the US version cut guncon support. Gun Survivor 2 was only released in Europe, Survivor 3 was about Dino Crisis, and 4 was released as Dead Aim in the US. It's pretty fun, combining the over the shoulder controls of RE4 with the exploration of RE1. It switches from it's third person camera to first person controls when aiming the light gun. Overall the Survivor games are skippable, but the first one gets a shout out in RE0 making at least that one canon.   RE: Gaiden is completely skippable unless you like quirky RPGs and absolutely love Barry and Leon.   That should cover everything other than don't bother with Operation Racoon City, and check out the CGI movies, Degeneration and Damnation."

Mostly on the Throwback map pack i mean come on. they could give us the R.P.D from  RE2 or The Mansion  from RE1. I also find that some characters are just filler i mean Gina. Give us ADA instead or Rebecca.  Also   they should have had more variety to it i really like the new stealth  element they  could make some mission stealth only or survival only like the classic Mercenaries and  Some Boss Battle.  Also the throwback pack  could have featured  nemesis or Tyrant battle.  They could have mix more enemies from multiple games.  There is a lot of potential if done right.

Its not just enemies from Rev 2, theres enemies from Rev 1(Skagdead, and Hunters), the armored turd monsters(Napads) from RE6, and to my surprise the Executioner from RE5 is present as well.  I was just expecting to see the Rev 2 enemies, but these were a welcome surprise.  Been keeping track of the enemies so far and there are currently 10 types in Raid mode.  Rotten  Afflicted  Iron Head  sploder  Napad(RE6)  Revenant  Skagdead(Rev1)  Hunters(Rev2)  Executioner(RE5)  Othrus  This isn't a bad bestiary so far, but its still pretty small. I know that theres shit that wont get unlocked until later like boss rushes, and stuff like that but I would really love to see them add in a few more classic enemies to Raid mode.  I'd be happy if they added in Lickers, Cerebus, hell even the chainsaw maniac from RE4. Sure they censor the kill animation but it'd be bitchin to have a few more monster types thrown into the mix.  I'd also like to see them expand on the skill tree as well, I think they have something pretty good, but I honestly think that there are other aspects that could be added in like increasing a characters movement speed(Even just a little bit), damage resistances to elements, as well as new types of special enemies and maps.  They should try to make the raid characters more unique though, they all mostly feel the same. So far the differences are in melee attacks and some characters(Pedro,Gabe, Gina) have a unique skill. I'm not sure what other stats there are, but I think there are some adjustments that could be made so these characters feel more individual."

Also it would of been nice to have more than just 1 melee animation. I mean RES 4 had more and it was a last gen game. But I guess that's why this game isn't 60$.
residentevil,2y6m5r,not_AIDS,1 point,Sat Mar 7 05:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not that far into the Raid Mode, got Barry to lvl 18 and Jill to lvl 6, but I'm loving it so far!  Rev2 is a breath of fresh air for the RE series. The atmosphere is great, the graphics are the best of any RE (imo), the customization is new but feels reminiscent of the old games and I love the direction they're taking the SP story.   All in all, I support this direction Capcom is taking RE and only hope they keep it up for RE7."

residentevil,2y5erc,Not_Isaac,3,Fri Mar 6 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this means Neil knew who was going to get kidnapped, or if it was just him speculating. He obviously knows something Claire/the player doesn't know, and I'm pretty sure he was the one who kidnaps Natalia at the end of Claire's episode 2, because Natalia mentions to Barry that ""the nice man"" works for Terra Save."
residentevil,2y5erc,saffron40,3,Fri Mar 6 16:53:32 2015 UTC,There is something fishy about Neil...
residentevil,2y5erc,Zaeh,4,Fri Mar 6 20:57:31 2015 UTC,....is it because his last name is Fisher?
residentevil,2y5erc,liquid0079,3,Fri Mar 6 21:14:32 2015 UTC,As soon as I saw Neil in that first cut-scene I pegged him as the villain. Notice his bracelet is always green. Pretty calm for someone who's just been kidnapped and taken to an island filled with monsters.
residentevil,2y5erc,Unifizz,2,Sat Mar 7 01:07:03 2015 UTC,"It looks like it's just a list of people at Terrasave, in which case it isn't spoiling anything. Natalia tells Barry that Terrasave takes her in after what happened to her parents at Terragrigia."

Neil is former FBC, and was trying to follow in Lansdale's footsteps by getting a sample of Uroboros in the hopes of creating a terror incident that would bring the FBC back. He works with Alex giving her the Terra Save members + Natalia in exchange for Uroboros. Alex betrays him by injecting him with Uroboros, turning him into a monster. Also Claire kind of had a thing for him, though not explicitly stated Moira will hint around at it in Ep 3."

residentevil,2y7ac7,JoshuaSwartz,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:18:30 2015 UTC,Not sure. Only thing that comes to mind is an issue I had with aim assist which seems to snap the reticle to the middle of a target's torso when you aim which I found pretty jarring. Turning aim assist off made things feel much more natural. No idea if that's what you're describing or whether your issue is related to that but I suppose it's worth checking out. I don't believe there are any other camera related options other than that so you may be out of luck.
residentevil,2y7ac7,AnimaOnline,2,Sat Mar 7 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"Alright so I reset all options back to default and that fixed it. In hind sight, I should of done this first.  One of the options forces the camera to always center in front of you. This makes it very awkward to move the camera around when you run. It's like a jerking motion.  Thanks for the tip and about aim assist."

residentevil,2y627c,KaidyPerry,2,Fri Mar 6 20:40:16 2015 UTC,"And when you did fuck up you got some hilarious death scenes. When my friend and I were playing through I fucked up once early on (the motorcycle QTE part) and he got impaled on the spikes, we thought it was hilarious so we then went through and intentionally failed every QTE part so we could see the different deaths. Sheva getting bitch slapped by the chain was one of my favorites too. The Wesker fight had some amusing ones but the earlier ones were better IMO."
residentevil,2y627c,Nikedawg,5,Sun Mar 8 03:23:38 2015 UTC,"Horrible is a bit of an overstatement, but definitely one of the weaker fights for me, personally, especially since you have to do the same one up to three times if you include LiN. Wrestling with the AI to not run into plain sight can also be a pain."
residentevil,2y627c,LexCrunch,2,Fri Mar 6 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"As i meantioned in another topic, I defeated final form Wesker by giving the AI one powerful weapon and just walked around until she killed him. The game was horrible."
residentevil,2y627c,NightmarishPT,3,Sun Mar 8 16:43:54 2015 UTC,Wesker in general pissed me off in that game. Apparently Chris pisses him off that much that he forgets he could just snap his neck in like 15 seconds.   He is also one of the few villians that didn't succumb to the form changing until then. He was just really strong and really fast.
residentevil,2y627c,Laalipop,2,Fri Mar 6 20:31:59 2015 UTC,I've never heard someone describe the finale of RE5 as 'anti-climactic'. I think it's anything but.

Many time have I been low on health with a few rounds in my last gun absolutely bricking it and hoping no enemies appear. The feeling of relief when you find ammo is so good.  Feels like how Resi should be. I hope Capcom take on board all the positive things said about this game and go back closer to its roots with Resi 5 And don't give us Gears Of Evil again
residentevil,2y5iqt,SilentOblivion903,2,Fri Mar 6 23:28:11 2015 UTC,You got it. The relief!  If you check out the review for episode 1 you'll see what I think of the previous games.

RE4 and up made this extremely easy by introducing the melee system. This game in particular, Barry can stealth kill most of his enemies, and Moira can stun them without even firing a bullet. I guess if you want to shoot every enemy in the chest until they die you'll be low on ammo, but my inventory is usually full of it."
residentevil,2y5iqt,basedjesusOG,2,Sat Mar 7 02:23:02 2015 UTC,"I always try for head shots. But you're right, with the improved melee it should be used more.  I ended up in too many tight spots. Episode 3 I'll be more careful. Res4,5,6 have trained me out of conserving ammo, bastards."

RE5 does it this way as well, and I've played many hours that way on a 60 inch as well. On the plus side, HUD elements now don't take up any screen space because they can be in the black portion."

Its was actually kinda convenient if you werent sold on the whole episodic Resident Evil deal. If it sucked you were only out 6 bucks instead of 25.

The laser has to originate from the gun, so it wavers around and takes a while to come up when you aim. The reticule also brightens when you have something targeted, which is nice for long range.  If you still prefer the laser, then by all means use it, but you are gimping yourself."
residentevil,2y3twp,Fatness,4,Fri Mar 6 06:46:58 2015 UTC,Hmm well I'll use the laser sight until I feel I have problems with it. I'm just hoping a mod comes out to make the aimer smaller cause it's too annoying to me honestly

I got the same problem once.

residentevil,2y25vf,chofortu,2,Thu Mar 5 21:44:20 2015 UTC,"It says you need to enter with a screenshot or video which includes the results screen - i.e., that's how we determine time.

It also mentions that questions should go in the thread itself!  ...Maybe give it another read through"
residentevil,2y25vf,LexCrunch,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:08:19 2015 UTC,From what I understood those were specifically for the challenges you give out. Not just speed running the game in general. I wasn't aware the two were one and the same. Guess I misunderstood. I also already assumed a video/screenshot was mandatory.
residentevil,2y1r5l,thatoneguy721,3,Thu Mar 5 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yes it is not canon. I may be wrong but I don't think it was ever accepted as canon, just a what-if side story. It may have been intended to be canon when it was being created though."
residentevil,2y1r5l,ohhimark108,2,Thu Mar 5 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is completely, 100%, through-and-through non-canon.  I don't really remember it even being debated. It was established pretty early on as non-canon, even by Capcom themselves."
residentevil,2y1r5l,Zaeh,2,Thu Mar 5 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"I was receiving several gaming magazines in the early 2000s. Their issue that covered Remake came with a small file from Capcom. It had detailed info on all the games, characters, release dates etc. It also had previews for remake, zero,  4, and the upcoming first movie. This file listed Gaiden on the timeline. This of course was probably just promotional material from Capcoms US branch. But also it is briefly mentioned in Weskers Report, a lot of which is now considered non canon. Only point is at one point it was considered canon."
residentevil,2y1r5l,Zaeh,2,Thu Mar 5 19:23:10 2015 UTC,"Gaiden has never been on any official timelines made by Capcom, so there's probably a misunderstanding there. It was probably just a list of upcoming releases in general.  Wesker's report is canon, and Gaiden is not mentioned in it."
residentevil,2y1r5l,Zaeh,3,Thu Mar 5 19:30:08 2015 UTC,"Actually Weskers Report did mention Leon joining an underground anti Umbrella force instead of the US Government. Also, weskers report followed Leon A/ Claire B. Said Ada fell to her to her death and Leon threw the g virus, though Claire A and Leon B is the generally accepted canon. Weskers Report was rewritten omitting the Gaiden reference and changing it's re 2 section and added zero and other small details in 2003. That version is canon. The original not so much."
residentevil,2y1r5l,Zaeh,2,Thu Mar 5 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"Wesker's report uses story elements from all four scenarios. It was made after RE 2 to give clarification on the actual events, which are a a combination of both of the 'routes'. You can't actually get the canon outcome in RE 2, similarly to RE 1.  I meant the specifically the 2003 revised edition of the report. The original might or might not have been meant as canon as much of the supplemental material in the series, but we got this canon version only less than 2 years after Gaiden's release so there wasn't much room for debate."
residentevil,2y1r5l,News_Bot,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"Very true. I'm not trying to say the game is canon. Almost the exact opposite. Just saying the game for a bit was left ambitiously canon, without any input from developers. The guy who wrote Weskers Report wrote Gaiden actually. So that could be why there is that small mention. I'm arguing that on message boards there are tons of fans who say the game is canon. They argue that it doesn't matter that the Re5 timeline doesn't mention it, because it doesn't mention Dead Aim, or that Dark Side Chronicles doesn't even give it an offhand mention. But I'm saying that Revelations 2 should finally put the argument to rest. I mean if it was canon you think this would be the perfect place to mention it, but it won't be.  Also I understand that the canon of RE2 is a combination of all 4, but Claire A/ Leon B has the most canon elements. The only real canon element from Leon A/ Claire B is that Claire fought Berkins 2nd form which was shown in Degeneration. Claire A/ Leon B was widely accepted for a long time.  Also, I kinda wish they'd release a version of Re1 that did have a canon story. Maybe a 2 player game. With the reremake it doesn't seem like it would take much work. Add it as a dlc or something."
residentevil,2y1r5l,Zaeh,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"There might have been an argument for it back in the day, but not anymore, and hasn't been for a long time.  Leon B / Claire A has more canon elements to it, but the fact that the other route has some of the as well makes neither really 'canon'.  The HD port of Remake is just that, a glorified port. They're not going to actually make any new content or change the game itself. Which, to be honest, I think is for the better."
residentevil,2y1r5l,News_Bot,0,Thu Mar 5 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"Every part of all three versions of Wesker's Report is canon.  Leon and Barry joined the ""Anti-Umbrella Pursuit and Investigation Team"", a top-secret military unit in USSTRATCOM. This is the ""underground anti-Umbrella organization"" referenced in both Wesker's Report and Gaiden. Jill was meant to be forced into joining the same unit in a scrapped game for the Gameboy Advance. The organization didn't have a name until Gun Survivor 4/Dead Aim.  ""Gaidens"" in this series, including Gaiden, Operation Raccoon City, 4D-Executer and the drama albums, all use the same worldview and timeline of the canon storyline, including organizations, characters, etc. They simply spin-off at certain points in the timeline into a parallel universe where events occur differently but still hinge on the same factors.  Wesker's Report does not follow any particular scenario order in BIO2. It actually incorporates all four quite blatantly, such as Leon throwing the G-Virus sample from Sherry's pendant away after taking it from Ada which is a very explicit mash-up between his two scenarios. The report's video is meaningless in the grand scheme of things. All three written versions of the report are canon (2001, 2003, 2014) with each one covering aspects the other doesn't, but they neither contradict each other nor anything else in the series."

No quicktime events, less cheesy dialogue, enemies that arent copy and pastes from RE4.  Its down point is that even though the dialogue is better, is it still has two of the most obnoxious characters in the series(Quint and Keith really suck) and its got a lot of short 5 min chapters in the mix that really feel awkward.  But the Ooze enemy type is an interesting BOW to fight.  If you're interested in more classical RE, Revelations 2 is turning out to be best RE game since RE4. The fact that it also has some legit Survival Horror mixed in is the main selling point."

Didn't remembered this one not canon, but not really canon one on the ship), Outbreak file 1&2 Dolphin (Gamecube - good alternative) - original REmake from 2003, Zero, Code Veronica X if I'm not mistaken    and finally PC: Revelations 1&2, 4, 5, 6, REmaster"

But, I also have their gameplay all over my youtube channel. xD  I still don't know what i feel about the super dodging in the Rev series, though.  However, their atmosphere is by far superior to 5 & 6. It harks back to the ""Explore what your given"" vibe of the original resident evil games. However, the gameplay mechanics are more up to par.  So, Resident Evil 4-6 are often claimed as going in a pretty weird direction. A lot of people traditionally like 4; however, the plot importance of chasing down the presidents daughter on surface value has 0 value to BOW investigations!! xD And lord knows where Res 5 and 6 were dreamed up, as far as story line is concerned.  TLDR; Both members of the RE: Revelations series set a stage which respectively hark back to the traditional RE games (good atmosphere). They both exhibit an action oriented survival horror space that can be rewarding to play, in handling and game experience. However, they can seem hand-holdy at times, as they abandon the more obscure puzzles of earlier RE games and have sequential linear objectives which are stated (not discovered). This lends it to being decently forgiving but still immersive!   TTLDR; I like RE:Revelations series! If on sale, do try! :DDDD"

residentevil,2xzjcl,LexCrunch,10,Thu Mar 5 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"The thing about Claire is she was young in a lot of the other games, for her I guess one could make the excuse Hormones, given she has as Leon put it in Degeneraton ""You chose the role of rescuer rather than fighter, a path me and your brother couldn't take"", so she's more or less involved with the political side of things in the RE universe.  I'd imagine that after years of political bs it would take it's toll on her and she'd mature differently where as you see Leon being the slick cool dude and Chris being the hero and wanting to save the world mentality, I actually don't see anything wrong with this given the things she has experienced over the years she would be that way now, same as any survivor hardened by years of viral outbreaks.  I can agree that in comparison to Moria who of course is new and has never had to deal with anything remotely close to Claire, Claire looks like a bland sandwich, as for Natalia I can't say, maybe it's because Sherry was more afraid than anything where as Natalia is just ""don't care I'm just here and don't know why"" It seems to me at least that Natalia's character design is meant to connect better with Barry's parental protective side so they decided that was the better route.  As for Jill she's always been the type about justice so it's easy to make that comparison."

She's in her 30s, unmarried and pouring herself into an organization that fights bio-terror (remember she called the NGO her boyfriend in Degeneration). Personally, I like Jaded Claire. The character makes a lot more sense to me.   I don't think she's as cookie cutter as she might seem to you. In the context of her character in the past, which you pointed out, I think it makes her stand out more. She's changing."

residentevil,2xzjcl,The_Naked_Snake,4,Fri Mar 6 00:06:37 2015 UTC,"she is currently in her early thirties and either too faithful to steve to get a guy for herself or just simply marries her work. As you know, she has been through worse things than Leon and Chris. They were much older than she was when they faced all the shit. Chris lost his entire squad, kinda something that can gives a man PTSD, Leon basically lost no one close to him (Marvin and Leon weren't that close). And Claire lost the only man who didn't try to grabbed her neck and feasted on it on Rockford, whom later became her boyfriend. If the fact that he died wasn't bad enough, he died as a B.O.W in human form, having tried to kill her earlier. After Steve's death, Leon was just  too busy screwing with the president's daughter and Chris was too busy fucking with monsters (and eating sandwiches with Jill) to be with her. It's natural that you become harsher, more serious and less caring after all that P/S: in case you haven't watched RE: D yet, Claire is much more badass than Leon, dispatching Zombies with ease, whereas mr.

I would defend that change though by saying our experiences shape us. People's mindsets change. This game obviously takes place awhile after RE2 and CVX, which means a lot has happened.    Claire is supposed to be more connected with humanity than the other characters. She isn't a trained soldier, she's a college student who got caught in bad situations looking for her brother. That is why instead of aggressively seeking out monsters like the BSAA seems to, she is part of TerraSave. But she is also the character that has had some of the worst happen. She's lost someone she's loved, seen a child she looked after stolen away to who knows where.    Maybe Claire is hesitant to get close to Natalia after Sherry was taken by the US Govt. Maybe her experiences with Steve's death, Leon's path, or her work in TerraSave has made her a different character than she was in those early games. I am willing to roll with it.

I think she might just be getting a little bitter and serious with so many years of having to put up with this shit, the same way Chris started to in RE5 after Jill's supposed death. Although its nowhere near as bad as Leon's sudden drop from being a lighthearted and joking Spiderman like personality in RE4 to the grim, morose dickhead he was in RE6 who apparently completely forgot that being bitten by zombies turns you into a zombie irrevocably.

residentevil,2xz9vz,CraziBoi94,3,Thu Mar 5 14:27:39 2015 UTC,"There is something in Ep. 2 that somewhat connects to Rev. 1, but doesn't really go into detail about the plot of the first game. Just a reference to it, so as of right now, its completely separate. You should be alright :)"
residentevil,2xz9vz,Lukar115,2,Thu Mar 5 03:33:18 2015 UTC,"You can get by without playing the first Revelations. Aside from a small (but cool) reference here and there, the game mostly draws from other entries in the series, namely RE5 and RE6."
residentevil,2xz9vz,YRuafraid,0,Thu Mar 5 15:13:18 2015 UTC,I'd get RE1 HD Remaster instead

residentevil,2xzodp,Mechanized_Ghost,4,Fri Mar 6 02:58:56 2015 UTC,"10:09  Currently in [gunfire] there is a civil war going on. According to eyewitnesses there is suspicion that there are possible biological agents or B.O.W. being used in the conflict. We repeat the last news for this time.  The independence movement has been gathering support in the East Smolensk republic. The reason was the social strategization of the community and economic growth. The president of the VSR, Svetlana Belikova, successfully finished the negotiations with the opposition, but the ceasefire proved to be short.  [10:41 is the shotgun grab, making the sentence impossible to understand.]  ....broke the rules of the ceasefire and announced that the indepence movement  was a 'terrorist group'. The leader of this movement, Ivan Edanovich, announced that the government of the SVR broke the ceasefire because they found mineral resources in the 'autonomous region'. 'We are ready for armed conflict', he added, 'until the end.'  [Girls open door, making the rest impossible to transcribe]  I hope this delivers. The radio message is probably somewhere in the game files.  Got to give the game props for a proper Russian voiceactor."
residentevil,2xzodp,News_Bot,2,Fri Mar 6 09:57:17 2015 UTC,"So REV2 takes place before Damnation. Thank you very much!  Here's the same stuff mentioned in Damnation's prologue to give an idea of the dates:   After intense fighting lasting several years, the first female President, Svetlana, offered a cease-fire to the rebels. This too did not last long. In November 2010, the government discovered useful resources in the rebel's land and government forces reopened their attacks, declaring a ""War on Terror."" As they continued to dwindle in the face of savage attacks, the rebel's tactics became increasingly radical, and another bizarre rumor quickly spread among the people. ""Monsters in battle."" In February 2011, the rumor reached the old city of Holigrad, a few kilometers from the presidential palace, an important government base.""   So REV2 seems to begin in January 2011 and ends in July."

It came with all the story levels and basic raid mode things. The season pass is more for those who don't care about raid mode and just want all the levels. Also, the two extra episodes unlock after you beat episode 4. Think of them like Separate Ways from RE4 or Adas Campaign from Re6."

But I do o,o  Most of the dlc is stuff you really have no reason to buy, such as the inventory spaces and the weapons. It's not hard to grind weapons once you've put in a day of leveling and you're given a boat-load of slots in my opinion.   Wesker's evasion-cancel thing is pretty useful, but not necessary. I got my moira up to 60 before I finally decided to grind out wesker and inherit it."

residentevil,2xxyh0,zzzzNNNN,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"What makes you say that? Wesker came back from being pretty damn dead, gutted by a Tyrant. Steve could come back if they wanted to, it's not as unreasonable as say Wesker coming back again. Wesker got pretty damn dead again in RE5, but considering that his head actually comes off when it's hit by the rocket, it seems unlikely that he'd return."
residentevil,2xxyh0,Sissle,2,Wed Mar 4 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"Wesker was not ""dead"" when he was revived. His virus stopped him from actually dying, whereas Steve died just like any B.O.W. would.  No virus in the series revives the dead as full humans. The G-Virus and C-Virus can only reanimate a corpse as a Zombie. The Uroboros Virus can only reanimate a corpse as a Revenant or its variants. The only virus Wesker had at that time was the G-Virus... and he knew about its Zombie revival capability. His comment to Claire was just a cruel joke implying that he can revive him but only as a Zombie.  It's a clever joke for knowledgeable fans, nothing more."
residentevil,2xxyh0,News_Bot,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:14:06 2015 UTC,Albert wesker is definitely dead. A certain someone could definitely have Steve. I do think he will get a mention in this at least

Unlikely though."
residentevil,2xxyh0,Zaeh,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:29:10 2015 UTC,It would most likely be one of the most absurd things in the series if that we're to happen. There's a reason why Albert Wesker is now definitively dead.
residentevil,2xxyh0,News_Bot,1 point,Thu Mar 5 06:37:37 2015 UTC,Possibly. That's what they seem to doing with the plot twists
residentevil,2xxyh0,Sigilbeckons,1 point,Thu Mar 5 23:20:24 2015 UTC,"The plot twists are fine and aren't actually shocking by themselves. The shock factor comes from how they're portrayed, such as the sneaky six month gap trick. It's storytelling 101."

residentevil,2xwfrz,gayinhellkid,3,Wed Mar 4 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true.  It is true they are scaled, but playing raid enough you'll notice guns of the same level have differing stats.   The guns sold also are special stat versions with parts included.  Hell for example if you loot a level 17 gun at level 12 which I have, the same level 12 gun had vastly inferior stats to the level 17 gun and I tried both in levels. Also the level 17 gun got stronger each level I gained.   So they are better, and get better with time while already having the parts.  It is true they scale, but just like rare drops, special stats and variance like in most games no two guns seem to be completely identical."

residentevil,2xv5vo,chofortu,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:52:30 2015 UTC,You are better equiped when you face him with Barry. Claire is easier on replay since you have the better shotgun.

residentevil,2xudcs,blackout57,2,Tue Mar 3 23:14:46 2015 UTC,I had this exact problem with Episode 1. Call in (not preferred) or message in at the Playstation store help. They'll Make you toggle on downloads or something on the website after they fix it on their end.

residentevil,2xsmxr,LexCrunch,2,Tue Mar 3 16:20:11 2015 UTC,"Giving his buzz saw a constant hitbox and letting him keep his one hit kill move is total bullshit, but smoke bombs really help. You can throw one down with plenty enough time to back way off and reload, and leveling it up actually gives you more of them, which is nice.  It's called a Scagdead, by the way."
residentevil,2xsmxr,bokuwahmz,2,Tue Mar 3 16:19:52 2015 UTC,I love the smoke bombs. Playing as Moira I'm going for:  Smoke bombs x10  Stealth  Revolver passive  Handgun passive  Evade-cancel passive

residentevil,2xucl9,chofortu,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:11:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know about raid mode, but in the campaign, each revenant is assigned the exact same weak spot every time. The one that has a glowing orange fuck-me light in the left leg will always have it there in every playthrough.  Besides that, fire bombs make quick work of them. If you don't have any, then you can use the machine gun to quickly pop pop them in each spot until the weak spot shows up. If you're so much of a stickler for ammo that you can't even spare that much, the knife also works."
residentevil,2xucl9,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:46:43 2015 UTC,The way to not waste ammo is to switch characters. Other than that no there isn't a way to get around using Natalia's sight. If there was shed be almost completely worthless as a support character.
residentevil,2xucl9,CraziBoi94,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:14:31 2015 UTC,"She's useful for a lot more than just spotting the weak point on a revenant. I was looking more for some visual indicator on the enemy model, like maybe the weak point changes color subtly or something."
residentevil,2xucl9,btbcorno,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:17:15 2015 UTC,"I actually just realized that if you're playing on Survival, where enemies can take a hit from an exploding bottle without being evaporated, it should at least blow off their outer layer and expose the weak point. But then you're wasting bottles unless you get a bunch clumped."
residentevil,2xteiy,CFGX,2,Tue Mar 3 19:06:19 2015 UTC,They seem to explode if you directly hit a baddie with it.
residentevil,2xteiy,ssimons15,2,Tue Mar 3 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"They hang around until they take damage, but they do go off prematurely if you happen to bean ball someone with them. You can shoot it, a monster can hit it, it can collide with an enemy, or it can detonate."
residentevil,2xteiy,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:42:35 2015 UTC,thats strange... could just be a bug.  Are you sure you picked it and not the exploding bottle instead?  I did get confuse a bit at first when I did not select it after hitting the shift key(default).
residentevil,2xteiy,Drunk3n_Axel,2,Tue Mar 3 19:34:13 2015 UTC,I have it set to the number 1 spot on Barry's bar. As far as I can tell I have no skills on him selected to alter the behavior of the bottle.

residentevil,2xrjl1,Trogdor7861,1 point,Tue Mar 3 07:12:37 2015 UTC,It has something to do with the online servers. Log off of psn or Xbox live and it should work! It happens when the servers get overloaded I think?

I've been getting her into games over the past year and a half, but 3D games are still beyond her. She's just not great at moving a character and camera at the same time. She likes this game because it gives her the opportunity to try these things out while I'm the one who's in charge of being offensive. She gets to find enemies and secrets in the environment without too much emphasis on precise controls."
residentevil,2xt1p0,Surprisebutsekz69,2,Sat Mar 7 10:42:24 2015 UTC,Oh nice! See that's the exact opposite with me and my SO. We are the action loving gamers. So when we tried the co-op... it didn't do well. So we play Raid mode mostly haha

residentevil,2xpwve,HobbieK,3,Mon Mar 2 22:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only thing I really don't like is the level is character specific....like, why play as anyone else? Yeah you can let other people use their skills after putting a ton of time into it, but I love playing newer and hard levels.

residentevil,2xpwve,mrbubbamac,3,Mon Mar 2 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"I dont even care, HUNK is just fucking awesome in this raid mode in the beginning. He is so much better in this game than in Rev. 1 imho.

residentevil,2xpwve,CraziBoi94,2,Tue Mar 3 02:12:35 2015 UTC,Definitely awesome. I am curious if we'll see Lady HUNK in this game. I enjoyed her in the previous Revelations and hope to see her return.  As for this game well... Wake me up on the 20th because I'll be rockin' that Albert Wesker like it was 2009.
residentevil,2xpwve,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Tue Mar 3 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"That's just how raid mode is unfortunately. Characters perform slightly more diversely than they did in the original raid mode, but they're ultimately going to be pretty similar to each other with a few differences early on (Hunk essentially has a rechargeable smoke bomb, Claire can divert some damage with her shield, etc). I find them to be decently diverse early to mid levels because you focus on what skills they have (at least until you start inheriting skills), but they're ultimately just different character models with slightly different perks going through the same missions. Everyone loses individuality during the higher levels when you begin inheriting their unique skills.   Daily missions does help with the monotony a bit, and it is fun pursuing their skills so you can experiment and inherit them to make characters super powerful."
residentevil,2xpwve,SiberianH,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:01:14 2015 UTC,"I don't like that they'll all turn into almost the exact same character by the time you maximize all they've got, but the journey to get there with each character is enjoyable so far."
residentevil,2xpwve,LexCrunch,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:54:22 2015 UTC,"When it comes down to it, if you spend time on leveling a character, it's exactly like any other character, minus the special abilities.

It makes sense for this to remain in rev. 2 and I don't see rarity listed elsewhere. I'll double check next time I'm logged in but what you say makes perfect sense.   So far I've only had .5 or 1 star ranked weapons; although it is early days.   Next thing I want to check is the difference in colours of records you get. I've seen black, yellow and; if I recall, green. Haven't tried looking it up yet though."
residentevil,2xqbbs,chofortu,2,Tue Mar 3 01:26:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the colours are tied to the stars
residentevil,2xqbbs,hellaradbabe,2,Tue Mar 3 01:51:23 2015 UTC,"I always thought of yellow as gold, but it makes way more sense as yellow since there's green later on. Those are the only ones I've encountered too, maybe more will come out per episode?"
residentevil,2xqbbs,xray703,2,Tue Mar 3 01:54:48 2015 UTC,I've gotten Samurai Edges with 1 star at least twice now and some random magnums. All yellow star.
residentevil,2xqbbs,Flame_US3r,2,Tue Mar 3 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"Red Vinyl is for 2 stars. Only seen one on co-op going through all of the episode 1 raid missions.  It was a shotgun that was quickly outclassed (it only had 3 mod slots or something).  Overall, level and modslot count seems to be the most important (over rarity)."

residentevil,2xoctg,krizalid70559,2,Mon Mar 2 17:16:12 2015 UTC,Yup he's got all his moves and audio in the game already.  There will likely be quite a few more bits of dlc as there are quite a few spaces for stuff that have been dummied out.
residentevil,2xoctg,Kman2097,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:40:55 2015 UTC,what episode is he in
residentevil,2xoctg,purpldevl,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:29:57 2015 UTC,He's a Raid Mode character only. His files aren't even tied to episodic data so whenever they unlock him is whenever you can use him but it's entirely possible to enable him in the PC version easily.

residentevil,2xopjn,mrbubbamac,8,Mon Mar 2 17:18:32 2015 UTC,"I think it just translates to ""I played the game once and it was too hard so it bothered me."""
residentevil,2xopjn,LexCrunch,6,Tue Mar 3 01:01:32 2015 UTC,"I don't like how head shots don't always cause an enemy to flinch. In RE 4, 5, and 6 a single bullet from a handgun would always cause a regular enemy to flinch. In the first Revelations you fought some kind of weird ooze monsters, so I gave it a pass on the no flinching. However in this game, it can take up to three bullets to the face to make a normal enemy stumble. That's kinda bullet spongy to me."
residentevil,2xopjn,liquid0079,3,Mon Mar 2 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"Even though its a similar gameplay style, I think 4, 5, and 6 were way more action oriented. In 5 the stagger was necessary so you can pop one in the head while tons of enemies swarmed you at once, then throw a bunch that knocked a whole group back at once. You don't fight as many enemies at once so far in Rev 2 (except maybe in the flamethrower part) so I don't think its necessary that enemies flinch at every headshot. You're right, the Ooze in the first game were meant to be more ""squishy"" and take more impact, but I think Rev 2 has a great balance of formidable enemies, and I'd anything I'd say they flinch too much. The only thing I really wish they added was exploding heads if you got a kill-shot on an enemy's head!"
residentevil,2xopjn,Fatness,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:55:31 2015 UTC,"Actually i think this is a bugg and this made it feel like the zombies are bullet sponges.  The problem is.  If the zombie have started to run line they  are roaring or similar it doesnt look  like ur hits registers. Like u cant get them dazed while  tyey are roaring,  they need to be moving against u,  this makes it feels, like the zombies take more hits cuz the monsters doesnt make some kind of animation or similar that  they gotten hit.  And they have no healthbars so u cant see if they are losing health or not,  this is very frustrating and i hate it cuz u need to stand still untill they attack u before u can daze them which is annyoing. Later while i was playing raidmode i noticed the hits do damage to them but they just doesnt react like they got hit and this is why  i think people feel that they are bullets sponges.  Plus all monsters works different and u dont  realize this untill u are playing raid mode.  Like iron head guys that u cant damage the head on abd u do alot of damage on the neck and red part on the back  but this doesnt give any indications it is like this inn normal mode.  Later the other monsters that u shoot once in each part untill u get out  the orange bubble u shoot todo alot of damage to.  I think the game need more policed hit register and and somehow give people guides they  can check out  ""not while u are playing but like a strat guide in steam""  that gives u hints of the weakspots."

I'm playing through on Normal difficulty, I just got to the part with Barry and I 2 shot most of the enemies with the assault rifle using the crouch + damage ability and aiming for the head.

residentevil,2xopjn,Turtlez4lyfe,3,Mon Mar 2 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but people might feel like they don't give a single shit about bullets since stagger/flinch animation looks like it. Just my assumption"

I am waiting for the new episode to come out so there will be more Raid Mode stages available.  I am pleasantly surprised by all the RE6 and RER1 throw back stages.  They can do it for RE4 and RE5 for sure.  One thing I am not a big fan of is the ability to inherit a skill.  So if you max a skill with a character, say Wesker, and the Magnum mastery, you'll be able to inherit the skill, which means every character can now have that skill.  I think this is not a good idea because in the ultimate end, every character would have the same exact set of useful skills, making character completely not unique."

residentevil,2xn4as,TonyDanzuh,-4,Mon Mar 2 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"Raid Mode in Revelations 2 is a piece of shit IMO, it ruined what made the first Raid Mode in REV1 so great."

residentevil,2xn4as,LexCrunch,-2,Mon Mar 2 07:04:00 2015 UTC,"The exploration, I admittedly haven't played much REV2 Raid mode, waiting for online to come before I really get into it.  I loved in Revelations 1 how the Raids still felt atmospheric and had explorations and optional/locked areas, it was great fun. Rev2 so far has been way more linear and it's just a chore, you just feel like you're killing all the enemies as some chore."
residentevil,2xn4as,DivineEmbers,2,Mon Mar 2 07:16:59 2015 UTC,"I thought that kind of bogged it down and slowed the action, to be perfectly honest. I really like the fast pacing in Revs 2's raid mode, but I can totally see where you're coming from; some levels can be really tiresome and indeed feel like a chore, like second level you get to play: it's all tight corridors in a tiny labyrinthine room, and they went and made it a bitch just to find the bad guys spawning in. That's some bad design, I think. If you're going to make it like that, then there should have been a radar.  One gigantic improvement over Revs 1's raid mode is the inclusion of a counter in the corner that tells you how many monsters you've killed out of how many there are. It was the second most frustrating thing to not get the genocide bonus and not know why, exhausting every corner after every event, trying to spawn in the enemies that were eluding you. The most frustrating thing was getting the no-damage bonus, which has been mercifully reduced to a no-heal bonus, which is a choice I strongly agree with."
residentevil,2xn4as,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Mar 2 07:44:25 2015 UTC,"Yes! Mission 1-2 is just plain AWFUL! It's such a chore trying to find the enemies spawning in, the length of the mission comes solely from running around the maze trying to find the stragglers. Even mission one is way better than that crap.   Other than that, I love raid mode in this game. There's some other annoying things that I hate (exploders and ranged enemies are very annoying, enemies hitting you immediately after you get out of a melee, the giant electrified dog in the casino stage, etc), but it's very addicting. The completion bonuses are also a lot more acceptable, the no damage or the accuracy bonus from the first one has thankfully been replaced with a much less annoying bonus.  It's repetitive, but I expect it to become less so as the other episodes are released."
residentevil,2xn4as,SiberianH,0,Mon Mar 2 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"I hate features solely made to take effort away from players, to some it's convenience and I respect that. But I've always enjoyed more obtuse/hardcore design because it usually supplements an atmosphere better.  The little counter in the corner just further takes you out of the game, in my opinion.  But I can definitely see why people want it that way."

residentevil,2xm37p,MuhGrib,2,Mon Mar 2 03:43:34 2015 UTC,"Don't kill anything you don't have to. Hallways, frequented rooms, sure thing, take 'em out. If you're not planning on going back to the room or you have enough room to get around them, try. Don't waste shotgun shells on dogs, however tempting it may seem. They're really easy to kill with the handgun. You can use the shotgun to decapitate zombies (by aiming up, into the air and firing as theyre just about on top of you), saving you haveing to burn them. A great beginners trick to compensate for having to burn zombies, the most frustrating part of this game (but make damn sure you do it as quickly as you can)  Use a dagger (not a battery) first when they grab you. The dagger will do a huge chunk of damage but not kill it. Good! You don't want it to die, then you'd have to burn it. When it gets up, be ready for a headshot when it gets near. The daggers previous damage will make head explosions happen almost all of the time. You don't have to burn enemies who's head exploded. Now look around for the dagger, which will spawn on the ground next to a zombie if you decapitate it after using it on them."

Really, you should learn the game's traps and challenges by encountering them on your own to get the full effect, so I won't say anything else."
residentevil,2xls87,cisum02,2,Sun Mar 1 22:26:45 2015 UTC,I like the game even as resident evil game i played the first episode for 6$ on my ps3. I think im going to wait and play it all at once on pc and hopefully it gets patched up great insight on pc version.   As for people saying its not  a resident evil game i actually think its imo the best one since RE4. If you want the very classic resident evil you wont get it though. If your fan of RE4 i think you will love it sort of that balance and middle ground if you ask me since resident evil 4 was the game to take the RE series more actiony.

residentevil,2xmbp2,ClaireRedfieldAllDay,2,Mon Mar 2 08:53:30 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I didn't watch much of this in order to prevent spoilers, but my stance is as follows: I enjoyed episode one, and was left wanting to experience the rest of the season. If it maintains the quality then I will be thoroughly impressed with my $25 dollar purchase. (Raid mode is a killer bonus.) This will DEFINITELY leave me wanting more, and I have actually been hoping for the release of a second season, so this not only makes sense, but I think it is a hell of a way to work with the RE series.   Besides, I foresee season 2 being $25 as well. Why? Because we already have raid mode and season 1, I can't see them releasing much more content besides a season 2 and more maps/characters for raid. The creators of RE care about their customers and their input; so I'm certain the title won't be more than $50."

residentevil,2xmbp2,omeganemesis28,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:07:27 2015 UTC,"This isn't a leak so much as speculation. Has anyone peaked into those files? A leak would be some official documentation confirming this stuff while this is just looking at what-ifs.  Sometimes devs have wonkey naming conventions. Its not far fetched to play level 1 of a game, and have the actual files and content structured in such a way of level_00-27 or something and level 2 for the player is actually level_27+ files. Or, towards the end of episode 5 for example, the ending will extent into what is labeled ""episode 6,7"" which really aren't officially. Stuff like that. Resident Evil Remake has an interesting file structure."
residentevil,2xmbp2,azureknightmare,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:15:13 2015 UTC,"But here it's pretty normal looking.

residentevil,2xlg39,WestRyder,4,Sun Mar 1 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"Well, look at it this way, for a season 1 pass you pay $19.99 and you get:  Episodes 1-6, Hunk in raid mode  HOWEVER  On March 31st there is whats called an ""all season pass"", or as I call it ""the whole fucking game that should be available for purchase instead of these micro transactions and paid for DLC"".  All season pass could be eps 1-6, + all raid mode characters, extra battle maps, monsters, weapons and costumes etc. Hell, maybe theres a 3rd bonus episode to go with episodes 5, and 6.  No price is listed for the all season pass, but you can bet its just going to be $40 USD +tax.  Basically if you pay now, you get shafted because you have to pay again for whatever else comes out between now and March 31st if you didn't get the season 1 pass, but even if you did get the season 1 pass there is the all season pass which is just 30 days away and is most likely the whole game with all the content.  There is also the chance that in 3 months there will be even more content produced for the game that the All season pass doesn't cover and you have to pay for it again.

The difference is when Rebecca has to save Chris you actually play as her to do it, unlike Barry. As well, you also have to save Rebecca and prevent her from being killed.  Chris also has to take a different starting route through the mansion as he doesn't have the lockpick.  There are other differences as well including an additional scene with Richard.  Chris also doesn't get the bazooka, doesn't start with the handgun, only has 6 item slots as opposed to 8, and has to do some extra puzzles Jill can skip. (Jill can just take the shotgun as Barry will save her. Chris actually has to do the puzzle to get it).  Etc etc.  There's a lot of differences that really make it feel like a seperate scenario despite it being overall the same thing.  Definitely worth playing through Chris."
residentevil,2xm5vl,ikarikh,3,Mon Mar 2 01:28:38 2015 UTC,I wonder who downvoted you and why.. People are  idiots.  But I'll tell you the same thing I told the guy above you; LESS bag space? jesus! you mean hes only got 6 slots? That was one of my biggest quams with the game. Backtracking to get the items I needed from the item boxes. It was exhausting and rather irritating.  I'll probably still give it a go though.
residentevil,2xm5vl,ikarikh,5,Mon Mar 2 02:12:26 2015 UTC,"It's because Jill is ""Easy"" Difficulty while Chris is ""Hard"". That was how it was in the original. The actual difficulty selections were added in later on.  Chris has no lock pick, has to start through the 2nd floor route, 6 item slots, Starts with only a knife, has more puzzles, doesn't get the bazooka/grenade launcher, and has to save himself/Save Chris via Playable Rebecca, and save Rebecca.  Wheras Jill can skip puzzles, get a powerful weapon, has Barry save her, can start on the first floor with the lockpick and has more inventory.  It's why most people love Jill because she was their first experience with the game due to her easier run.  Regardless, backtracking and inventory management are a staple of the old games. They were part of the difficulty of the game in general.  It made you really have to think and plan ahead. It's also why Remake added in the Crimson Heads and burning bodies to further the difficulty involved in backtracking through rooms multiple times.  It's a very different experience compaired to today's linear progression games and boundless inventory slots."
residentevil,2xm5vl,John_YJKR,1 point,Mon Mar 2 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"interesting. Whats it like playing as Rebecca and how long do you play as her? Does she only have 6 item slots? Any special weapons?  That's cool that the remake added the crimson heads and burning bodies. I guess one plus I can see abt Chris is that hes always got a lighter. Means instead of having to waste two slots for the kerosene and lighter as Jill, you just have to use one slot for the kerosene (if you even want to burn the bodies), right?"
residentevil,2xm5vl,ikarikh,2,Mon Mar 2 06:55:01 2015 UTC,You play as Rebecca for a few min only. If I recall correctly you fill up the lighter with Chris when it runs out. I don't think you take the kerosene with you.
residentevil,2xm5vl,John_YJKR,3,Mon Mar 2 12:10:00 2015 UTC,Lighter is a static item Chris always has and it doesn't run out. The Kerosene can is what you refill and take with you to burn bodies.

residentevil,2xm5vl,ikarikh,0,Tue Mar 3 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"Correct, and Chris can do two puzzles without wasting an item slot as well.  And Rebecca's portions are very short. But she is still playable none the less. And no she only gets a handgun and can't access the storage crate (to prevent you from losing items to her when you switch back).  Rebecca can be played twice in the game depending on your choices you make. As well you may also need to save her depending on your choices as well. It's also possible to never play as her and have Chris take care of himself. Again, all about what you do or don't do as Chris.  And like Barry, she can die. Though there are multiple locations she can die at as opposed to Barry's one single location."
residentevil,2xm5vl,NightmarishPT,2,Mon Mar 2 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"Question; you know the part of the game where you initially get the shotgun in that room where you're supposed to have the broken shotgun handy to replace the real one? Say you didn't have the broken shotgun, grab the real one and leave the room; Does the game prompt you to switch to Rebecca to save Chris? or are you just kinda F'd and die?  I'm gonna do my best to keep her alive throughout the game. First I'm going to do a run-through of RE4 (a vastly inferior title I know), but then I'm gonna do my Chris Redfield run.

You can also arrange them so they're near/on top of each other and save a burn or two that way, if you're careful. You can afford to let some rot without burning them. Is the room flashing white and not connecting important locations? Let 'em turn, you're not going back there. Is the area in question more than a character and a half wide? You can probably avoid it if you come back, there's a decent chance that it won't stand up. This seems to vary by location, in some cases I've walked within inches of a corpse with no result, in others they pop up halfway down the hall. Even if it does get up, you might be able to get through the room in the time it takes for it to get up and go for you. Some are going to randomly get head/leg shotted. This becomes more likely later in the game when you're using heavier weapons. Flame grenades are very resource efficient. One hit to kill the zombie, and dispose of the corpse. You don't get many of these, especially early on, but they're still helpful. About a third of the way through the game you leave the mansion. When you return, some of them will automatically disappear whether they were dead, red, or still alive when you left.    By the midgame, they're not even that big of a deal to fight. Shotgun ammo changes from a commodity that you have to horde, to being common enough to use regularly, and while they're worse than zombies, you'll start seeing tougher enemies regularly."
residentevil,2xkv6a,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Mar 2 01:21:43 2015 UTC,I argue that those things are easier to dodge than zombies anyway. Try not to worry about them until you've experienced it being a real problem.
residentevil,2xkv6a,thespectreofcapital,0,Sun Mar 1 20:28:04 2015 UTC,"He has less inventory space and you have to hunt for those little keys when Jill can just unlock them with a lockpick. Jill is definitely meant for new players, she makes up for the lack of health with increased speed and storage space."
residentevil,2xkv6a,LexCrunch,2,Sun Mar 1 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"The inventory space is really more of an annoyance than a challenge, and the small keys are only relevant for the first few minutes of the game. It really comes down to preference, and I recommend the character with more health if constantly dying is your issue.  I don't know where you're getting that Jill is faster, either. Her run speed is actually lower than Chris'."
residentevil,2xkv6a,BPRoberts,2,Sun Mar 1 20:30:46 2015 UTC,I guess I read that somewhere and it influenced my perception... I only ever played as Jill and tried Chris one time but got quickly frustrated with the keys and lack of inventory space.
residentevil,2xkv6a,LexCrunch,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Jill's extra item spaces were offset by her larger arsenal, which personally frustrated me. The way I see it, Chris just has to do more work, but has an easier time in the long run with a larger margin for error and a much simpler weapon selection. Honestly, I was won over the second I tried one-shotting the crimson head boss with a flash grenade."
residentevil,2xkv6a,BPRoberts,1 point,Sun Mar 1 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"The differences between Chris and Jill become much less pronounced for an experienced player. I very much appreciated the extra inventory spaces my first few playthroughs. Chris's extra health is nice, but being able to carry an extra first aid spray is nicer. Taking an extra hit is good, but being able to kill a boss faster so you don't get hit is better. That's besides all the sections that're either easier, or simply done for you.  Getting the shotgun a few rooms sooner helps A LOT when you're not good enough to avoid zombies and are burning through handgun ammo.  Getting the assault shotty sooner isn't a huge deal, but the extra 10 rounds can be, as can ""the can of fizz.""  Skipping Plant 42 can also save you some herbs/ammo, Barry having actual knockback helps a lot with Lisa.  Two extra inventory slots doesn't just mean less juggling of key items (which is a bigger deal when you don't know what they're all for yet) it also means you can lug around more herbs, or that you don't have to choose between carrying extra shotgun or handgun ammo and just take both."
residentevil,2xkv6a,BmorePride14,2,Mon Mar 2 01:09:20 2015 UTC,"I might just have a hard time sympathizing since I know the game inside and out and always try to speed through it. I've forgotten what it's like to experience it fresh, but even then I valued health over inventory.  Honestly, the handgun is so balls that I would usually recommend dumping it at the first opportunity. I like the one or two extra inventory slots more than a pea shooter; and even with Chris' limited inventory spaces, you're still given enough room to lug around a full heal if you really need it.  Both characters have unique advantages in the narrative, too. Jill gets a bigger gun to help fend off Lisa and can flat out skip Plant 42, and Chris gets a flamethrower for the Black Tiger fight and makes quick work of the crimson head boss. I can't stress enough how great all of those are, but with a speed run bias, I personally prefer Chris.  Like I said before, it pretty much comes down to preference. They both have their ups and downs that balance out well between them. Knowing exactly what to do and how to effectively juggle all the items, though, I don't have quite the same appreciation for supplementary space as someone fumbling around in the dark."

residentevil,2xl9sz,Viennel,4,Sun Mar 1 19:58:58 2015 UTC,"Well, RE6's melee system is extremely complicated. I'll try to explain the whole thing.    There are six types of general context sensitive melee attacks:   Headshot Headshot from behind Coup de grace Mini stun Downed enemy Counter      Every one of these besides the counter costs one bar of energy. The counter is free. Shooting enemies in the arm will turn them around and set you up for the same attack as a headshot from behind. Going to their front will give you the crappy mini stun attack, though. A coup de grace is extremely powerful. To get it, attack or slide into a stunned (headshot, arm shot) or mini stunned enemy for a super stun. The context sensitive action in the front will be a coup de grace, but it will be a regular headshot from behind if approached from behind. You can quickshot (aim and fire at the same time) to set up a mini stun. You cannot use this to super stun a mini stunned enemy. You cannot perform either headshot melee attack on stairs or other steep slopes. The game will default to the crappy mini stun attack instead. The action from behind on a super stun will turn into a regular coup de grace, though. The downed attack can change depending on what type of weapon you're using between two-handed, one-handed, bayonet rifle, and knife. They all do the same damage, so you want the one-handed stomp, which is fastest and kills in one hit if you hit the head. Neither the mini stun attack nor downed attack are invincible, but the other context-sensitive attacks are. The exception is using the bayonet rifle, which makes both invincible. The mini stun attack is terribly slow and not very powerful, yet it generally affects an impressive area. The game likes to set you up in a sort of trap to get you to use them a lot, but it's almost always a bad idea. The bayonet rifle changes this to an invincible attack that sets up a super stun. Your attack button is now a melee when not aiming. The first attack is free and costs nothing, and the second costs one energy and induces a mini stun. These vary between characters, and can change if you're using a one-handed weapon, two-handed weapon, or the bayonet rifle. Sliding also causes a mini stun. Shooting J'avo in the same spot besides the head or arms twice causes a mini stun. If you point the camera at your character's face, or there are bad guys close to their back, your attack button will turn them around and either elbow them if you're male, or kick them if you're female. The elbow will super stun them instantly, and the kick will knock them down. They both cost one bar of energy. Jake's punches behave exactly like your regular melee attack when aimed and fired: the first attack doesn't do much, the second mini stuns, and the new third one also mini stuns. Any one of those attacks will super stun an already mini stunned enemy. It's free to use, and bypasses context, so it can help more easily set up coup de graces. You can get special attacks with the knife by tapping backwards or forwards on the movement stick as you swing it. Forward is a crappy stepping swing, and backwards is a pretty good quick stab. There's a dash attack I always forget about, too. Press attack during a sprint. The males' shoulder ram will mini stun, and the females' jump kick will knock down.     I think that's all the basics. There are quite a few monsters in the game with very specific attack responses such as mini or super stuns or even instant kills from a counter, but these rules apply to your common zombie or j'avo."

residentevil,2xi1f2,JpDeathBlade,2,Sun Mar 1 15:54:24 2015 UTC,"Nice work, but I know you can do better   Never use that slow dashing knife move, and get the Hairsplitter skill if you can. This will make your knife stronger and let you walk at full speed when knifing. On top of speeding past collecting hourglasses, it also makes the scripted segment with the shelf much more consistent. If you plan on grinding out more skills, then definitely also shoot for Evade Cancel and any other skills to improve your dodge. You can pick up items while moving at a full sprint. If you feel compelled to collect the first green herb, you can do it while dashing past it. When you're waiting to control Moira to spot the keys, waste all of your handgun ammo. This will make the keys magically fall off the hook when Moira finds them, and she can immediately pick them up and save you several seconds. You won't need any of those bullets anyway. Have Moira take point if you need to bum rush through bad guys. She recovers health naturally and can save you time and health items in case you make a mistake. You were bleeding for a long time at the end, and it knocked your time pretty bad. Turn off tutorials in the options Don't bother spotting and gathering extra supplies with Moira's light. You only need the shotgun and the ammo you immediately find after picking it up. When Moira has to climb up and unlock the door for Claire, just unlock the door and turn around to go through the next door. You don't have to open it or control Claire at all, she'll just teleport to you as long as the door is unlocked. Get the Quick Heal skill; it's cheap and saves a bit of time. If you don't want to, then try healing yourself during the stupid slow-walking scripted events. You don't want to be stuck walking when you could be sprinting. Forget the flame turret. Have Moira make a bee line for the door, then switch to Claire and use the shotgun to blast anyone who makes it to the doorway. Use your exploding bottle when there are like three dudes at once, which shouldn't happen until Moira is just about finished. Learn to reload cancel. Look at your ammo counter and switch to another weapon and switch right back just as you see your magazine fill up to skip the end of the reload animation. You can pick up items, do follow-up attacks, or other generic actions to do this as well, but weapon switching is the most reliable in a fight. Use this to pump out more shells quicker when defending Moira at the end. The left side of the bridge doesn't have any collapsing planks. Sprint through there to keep your momentum. You probably could have skipped a couple of time bonuses since you have well over three minutes left at the end.   I really don't like running Claire's part because of the first bit that's all slow tutorial, but I want to help improve your time."
residentevil,2xi1f2,LexCrunch,1 point,Sun Mar 1 21:38:24 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you for this. A lot of very helpful things in here. I'm still learning the game (those speed runs were my 5th and 8th time through the countdown mode) so I'm still rather new to the game. Skills is what I'm focusing on now just for the extra bonuses. Also, I didn't know that about the key auto dropping very cool."
residentevil,2xi1f2,JpDeathBlade,2,Sun Mar 1 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"Glad to help. I've been running through Claire's episode over and over for the past two days, trying to grind out enough BP to maximize the dodge skills as fast as possible so that I can set a solid time for Barry this week, so I picked up on a few things. Hope to see you set something stellar."
residentevil,2xi1f2,LexCrunch,2,Sun Mar 1 21:55:35 2015 UTC,Just did 2 runs with some of your suggestions (not all of them). Even with a few mistakes I was able to drop my time down to 9:17 (over 30 seconds!). With some more skills and practice I can easily see myself going sub 9 minutes.

residentevil,2xi1f2,btbcorno,1 point,Thu Mar 5 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"Make sure to grab the flame bottle in the room that has it, and use the shotgun to keep the goons out of the doorway. Keep closer to the doorway to bottleneck them and influence their aggro towards you. Use weapon switches to reload cancel so you can get more shots in quicker, and toss the bottle when they get too close to Moira. By the time you have to do that, she should be done."

I get about 8000-9000 BP per run, and it takes roughly 19 minutes. I've also noticed that you don't need to get all the medals to get the full 2x BP multiplier. I've gotten it with only 9 medals."
residentevil,2xhgrr,liquid0079,2,Sat Feb 28 21:41:05 2015 UTC,Do you kill enemies or just run through (for the most part)?
residentevil,2xhgrr,laserz,3,Sat Feb 28 22:02:11 2015 UTC,I kill pretty much every enemy that I see. You need to in order to fulfill the medal requirements
residentevil,2xhgrr,liquid0079,2,Sat Feb 28 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"So, you get BP from finding gemstones and things, and then it's all multiplied at the end of the campaign. The multiplier seems to be related to the number of medals you achieve in that run.  So I guess you'd need to try to achieve as many medals as you can, while also collecting as many hidden gemstones as possible. I think the gems are randomly located as sparkles for Moira and Natalia to find, so I don't see any particularly easy way to do it! Not to say there isn't one."
residentevil,2xhgrr,chofortu,2,Sat Feb 28 19:55:24 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. I also think you might actually get a larger multiplier for playing through on either of the extra modes: the time attack and the invisible enemy modes. Give that a try and see if it works.

It's very annoying to me that she can use the shotgun so much more effectively than the character who relies more on it.  As for everything else, Chris doesn't need the first shotgun or the grenade launcher, and already gets the assault shotgun at the perfect time. Old keys aren't really a problem at all, either.

It reduces the lag between shots by quite a lot, but Chris can't do it half the time because it only works if you fire from the hip, and he shoulders his shotgun instead in certain rooms, whereas Jill always fires from the hip. Unfortunately, the only times you would really need to do it are some of the only times this happens."

residentevil,2xclt8,REsoleSurvivor1000,5,Sat Feb 28 16:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah he does. I also like his stagger move since the thrust often hits two or more targets, whereas I find the roundhouse move or punch other characters have rarely gets the same collateral damage.   My least favourite finisher is Jill's, the forward flip nonsense."

residentevil,2xclt8,REsoleSurvivor1000,4,Fri Feb 27 16:31:48 2015 UTC,"These are not in the story mode, these are only available in Raid Mode (In some other games they call it Horde Mode but this one has so much more depth than any Horde Mode I've seen in any game). It's pretty much Resident Evil meets RPG, in a very well executed way."
residentevil,2xclt8,Sissle,3,Fri Feb 27 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"It's a thing called raid mode where you finish the levels without dying and they get progressively harder. Also monsters have special abilities, but you get weapons that hit harder and can be tinkered with weapon parts."
residentevil,2xfyle,RareItemX1,2,Sat Feb 28 07:18:20 2015 UTC,Available if the weapon is lvl. 100
residentevil,2xcw8m,YRuafraid,8,Fri Feb 27 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"This is why Code Veronica was so awesome when it first came out. Back in the day we only had Mansion/Raccoon city Resident Evil's (ignoring any spin offs). So we're used to like, urban grotesque, and spooky mansions. Enter Code Veronica. You freaking start the game off in Zombie Auschwitz- By the time we're finished with it, and the training camp, we're thinking it's getting close to the end. I mean, all the RE's before went about this long. But no. Bam. Freaking Antarctica. Then all over again as Chris. Esthetically pleasing and new, and Claire is just hella cool. The only character in the originals (Wait... And 4, 5, 6...) where were not playing a cop or a Stars member, or BSAA trained killa. Should have been RE:3."
residentevil,2xcw8m,Lajiggyjar,3,Fri Feb 27 18:49:56 2015 UTC,"It actually was in the running to be Biohazard 3. Resident Evil 3 was a gaiden (side story) of RE2 in the Japanese releases, and didn't even feature Jill until later in development. Code Veronica was one possible game in the works for the next installment."
residentevil,2xcw8m,AmethystWind,4,Fri Feb 27 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Code Veronica was never supposed to be titled Resident Evil 3, but instead there were two other games in development at the same time: 'Biohazard 3' and 'Biohazard Gaiden'. The former was a sequel to RE2 and had HUNK as a playable character on a cruise ship, and the latter was Jill's adventures with Nemesis (although like you said, it was originally going to have a civilian protagonist instead of Jill).  That 'Biohazard 3' then moved to the PS2, and the HUNK/cruise ship scenario scrapped. The game was titled Biohazard 4, and 'Biohazard Gaiden' got the number 3 attached to its title only months before release. Code Veronica was always just Code Veronica, but interestingly enough, Jill was supposed to be the main character at an early point in development (when she wasn't used for 'Biohazard Gaiden' / the final RE3 yet)."
residentevil,2xcw8m,Zaeh,1 point,Fri Feb 27 23:30:05 2015 UTC,Yep. Which is why I said it shoulda been 3.
residentevil,2xcw8m,Lajiggyjar,2,Fri Feb 27 20:32:14 2015 UTC,Yeah... I remember thinking the game was about to end during the part on the plane (that boss took me forever to beat) and then all the sudden I'm in a new location with another half of the game to go! It was great
residentevil,2xcw8m,fender_bender16,3,Fri Feb 27 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"I'd have to put RE:CV up there with one of my favorites in the series.  It's hard to rank them all, but this is up there with RE1 (and REmake/REmaster) and 0 for me.  RE1, 0, and CV are all very exploration driven.  Although RE2 and 3 were great, they were very linear.  I don't mean linear like RE4, 5, & 6, but go back and replay 2 & 3 and it's very obvious where you need to go next.  RE1, 0 and CV really required you to analyze the map and explore each corner of every room, and then backtrack to unlock a different piece of the map.    I highly recommend going back and replaying it, I bought it for PS3 a few months back for $20 and it was well worth it to be able to experience it again (even though the dialogue and voice acting is incredibly cheesy)."
residentevil,2xcw8m,Lajiggyjar,3,Fri Feb 27 17:32:46 2015 UTC,"I think I will go back and play it, thanks! My only dilemmea is if I should wait and hope for a HD Re-release, or better yet a remake. That would be amazing and it would feel like a new game to be because I pretty much forgot 90% of it."
residentevil,2xcw8m,krizalid70559,4,Fri Feb 27 17:40:02 2015 UTC,It is an HD release btw.
residentevil,2xcw8m,brahnix,2,Fri Feb 27 18:50:55 2015 UTC,So is that the best version of the game? I guess I'll get it
residentevil,2xcw8m,SilentBobVG,4,Fri Feb 27 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"I first played this game when I was 14 or something.  To this date I would say this is my favorite Resident Evil game still.    I think the biggest plot twist for me is Alfred and Alexia.  Without spoilers, you guys know what I am talking about.  I like the whole atmosphere of the game, I like the setting, I like the characters, I like Alexia owning Wesker, and man, I just love Claire as the main character."
residentevil,2xcw8m,unclepickle1,3,Fri Feb 27 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"My friend and I just finished that game on the 360! We decoded to play the 'HD' version of it to see what had changed. It looked a bit better, but the main differences we noticed throughout the game was the differences in color. Higher contrast to give the game a darker feel.  Moving on. It's an awesome game that is unforgiving and honestly challenging. I think it's the hardest RE game released. The puzzles are awesome, and the story has its moments. The time when you learn that Alfred is actually playing Alexia in the beginning threw us through a loop. The fight on the plane that, if you didn't have enough ammo for it, you were completely screwed.   I hated Steve though. Fuckin Steve. ""I'm So Sorey Claire"" and his creepy try to kiss her sesh when she was asleep. Overall, great game, but we normally don't go back and play it unless we feel like getting frustrated."
residentevil,2xcw8m,contextParam,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:30:28 2015 UTC,Resident Evil's terrible Canadian actors have always been my favorite.  I like Steve for all the wrong reasons

The romance between Steve and Claire was unnecessary for a Resident Evil game......and Steve is just plain annoying.  So is Alex Ashford.  The fight with Nosferatu was memorable though."
residentevil,2xcw8m,krizalid70559,3,Fri Feb 27 17:36:59 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree - the game would have improved tenfold if Claire had just shot Steve when she first met him. Easy to do too, since he was shooting full auto at her."
residentevil,2xcw8m,chofortu,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:49:23 2015 UTC,"You take that back! Steve was awesome, from what I remember. A bit of romance in a RE game was a nice change"

residentevil,2xcw8m,omeganemesis28,2,Fri Feb 27 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"I think there was an HD rerelease for PS3 - maybe get that? Either way, you may as well get CVX rather than vanilla CV.  I'd encourage you to replay it! I did so a few months ago. It's still a lot of fun.  You call it a random twist, but CV was actually meant to be the next entry in the franchise after RE2 - it was going to be called RE3, and RE3 would've been the non-numbered spinoff. I don't know why they changed their minds."
residentevil,2xcw8m,mrbubbamac,3,Fri Feb 27 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"It was a contractual thing IIRC. Capcom wanted a sequel quickly, and CV was too ambitious of a project to be released when they wanted, so they borrowed as many assets from RE2 that they could (including copy+pasting the police station) and made RE: Nemesis, which they titled ""3"" to increase interest."
residentevil,2xcw8m,LexCrunch,5,Fri Feb 27 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it had to do with the rights that Sony had with the game.  RE:CV was going to be released as RE3 on Dreamcast, but because Sony had the rights to the ""numbered sequels,"" they had to change the name of it in order to release it on Dreamcast.  They then created a quick ""numbered sequel"" on PS, which turned out to be what we now know as RE3, which like you said, had a lot of copy/paste backgrounds in order to release it quickly."
residentevil,2xcw8m,bogart1,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:25:16 2015 UTC,Interesting... didn't know any of this... thanks guys!
residentevil,2xcw8m,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:39:03 2015 UTC,yeah its pretty funny how major Resident Evil titles had political issues with some of the deals Capcom had made. RE4's dev story is interesting to say the least
residentevil,2xcw8m,The_Naked_Snake,2,Mon Mar 2 05:19:49 2015 UTC,"It's my favorite one, tied with RE2 I would say. Very different type of setting from the mansion/lab/city we had grown used to. You were trapped on a creepy military base island ruled by this weird family.   What I loved about the story is that it went back into the past, talked about the founding of Umbrella with Alexander Ashford, Ozwell Spencer, etc. It just showed a cool back story, and demonstrated how tangled and deep Umbrella's roots go (RE5 kind of did a similar thing).  The best thing was thinking you beat the game and leaving the island, and then BOOM. You are trapped in fucking Antarctica, then switch to playing as Chris. I thought it was awesome when they brought Wesker back, this creepy dude back from the dead with weird abilities (though they just multiplied his powers tenfold in RE5 which I didn't really like). Really great atmosphere and soundtrack, and probably the hardest RE game. You can get yourself into a really shitty situation if you don't conserve ammo/pick up certain weapons through some oversight (like leaving the fire extinguisher in the metal detector box in the beginning so you are prevented from obtaining the magnum later). Very difficult, but very rewarding. Getting an A Rank on the HD Remaster on the Xbox 360 is probably the achievement I worked hardest for."
residentevil,2xcw8m,Elda-Taluta,2,Fri Feb 27 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"I intend to play it again in the near future because my memories of it are not good ones. I played it a long time ago and really hated it. Something about it felt ugly and unfinished, like the game was purely experimental. The graphics are extremely dark, blurry and ugly, making it really difficult to see; there's no animation for turning while standing still, and the timing of the footstep sounds don't seem to match the animation. There's also the ridiculous infinite health item glitch that breaks the game.  It didn't have a lasting appeal for me, either. Maybe I just never found it, but the other games have some difficult or advanced hidden tech to make the game more interesting when you run through it again. The most advanced tech I found in CV was luger headshots, abusing the knife with good range and timing, the infinite health item glitch, and mashing fast enough to shake off zombies before you take damage. Not that great. Even the extra game mode wasn't all that impressive.  Even among all those issues I have, it also feels a lot slower, it tried to take itself seriously even though you can dual wield heavy pistols and sub machine guns, and Wesker came out of the Matrix. Steve is far and away the most annoying and unlikable character in the entire series. I can't believe you're expected to feel anything for him when the prick gets killed off. As of right now, it's pretty close to the bottom of my list for the series, though I would love for that to change somehow. The Dreamcast version didn't help with the game's impression, either, since it has one of the worst video game controllers I've ever had the displeasure of using. If that HD port they did came out on PC, I'd go for it and give it a second chance."
residentevil,2xcw8m,litholine,2,Fri Feb 27 23:14:02 2015 UTC,"My favorite part about Code Veronica is how tight the ammo is during Claire's mission on Rockfort Island. It was entirely possible to complete that part of the game and not have enough ammo to defeat the tyrant on the plane. Later in the game when you fight Mutant-Steve, you need to have two full heal items to escape his attacks. Again you can advance that far into the game, but still fail without those items.   Your items from the Claire scenario automatically carry over to Chris's. So you walk into the second scenario thinking you can rock some zombies with semi-auto handguns and AK-47's. Then Wesker comes at you with motion detecting Hunters that ALSO poison you. Then all your fancy weapons don't seem all that useful. TOTALLY reminds me of Claire/Barry dynamic in Revelations 2.  Zombies in CV started to climb stairs more aggressively. But they were never as fast as the zombies in re3 or even re2 when they started sprinting at you. Also you had to press an action button to run up stairs, but in RE3 you didn't which is a step backwards."
residentevil,2xcw8m,omeganemesis28,1 point,Sat Feb 28 13:20:18 2015 UTC,"It's a very fun game. It gives you a lot more firepower without being too easy IMO. It has some memorable bosses and probably the best soundtrack of all the RE games. It keeps all the classic monsters (Zombies, Hunters, Dogs, Tyrant) while also creating interesting new ones (Fuck Bandersnatchs). It did good work bringing Claire and Chris together.    It was neat revisiting Code Veronica in The Darkside Chronicles. The characters looked good, the voice acting was better and the soundtrack was improved. The liberties they took with Wesker's involvement were...odd? But the story was still fun to go back to in arcade shooter form.    If you own a PS3 they released an HD version of CVX and if you own a PS4 you can play it in the PS Now app. If you haven't already they should have a free one week trial for it so that should be enough time to beat it."

All of the episodes come out in a few weeks, and online co-op is unlocked along with it as well.  As it stands, you can't play online co-op yet, either in Raid Mode or Campaign, until the final fourth episode is released. Wouldn't hurt to wait, but it doesn't really matter.

Jump straight into survival mode when you play the campaign and you'll be cowering behind corners. I missed those days from RE and RE2 and they seem to have recaptured them in Rev2. The raid mode is a ton of fun, too. I can't wait for online to be introduced.   The one gripe I've heard about this title that seems sensible is the fact that the environment is kind of bland. The first episode is in a prison though, so I can't really see how they could've spiced it up more than they did."

Ignore those and play a couple of matches offline, then go back and sign into PSN and relaunch the game."

Maybe i should have buyed it on my PS4 like i wanted to do  first place.  I buyed it on my PC to play with a friend and i can't  no online until episode 3 i believe.  And That split-screen bullshit.

residentevil,2xchtk,xray703,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:20:44 2015 UTC,I found the simpler raid mode maps are playable at 60fps. But the campaign and any map with particles are unplayable. Guess I won't be playing through episode 1.
residentevil,2xchtk,LexCrunch,3,Sat Feb 28 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think anyone has benefited from this change. I was getting by okay before on my potato rig, but now there are too many straight up unplayable sections both in the campaign and in raid mode for me to want to play it. Even dudes with good gaming rigs are reporting serious problems. I'm sounding like a broken record at this point, but I really miss MT Framework.  I'm hoping it's just one of many experimental patches before the game is optimized for PC to run like butter instead of diarrhea.  EDIT: I got desperate and slammed the resolution so hard that StarCraft is pissing itself laughing.

Mostly I'd like map packs, tho. Yeah, there do seem to be s surprising number of maps, all taken from the main game, Revelations 1 and RE6, but Id go nutters for  remakes (or honestly just port) of RE4's Mercenaries maps, and maybe port over ORC's maps. Game sucked, but I wouldn't mind playing Raid Mode in Raccoon City. Extra characters like Leon pr Krauser would be fun, too, but I wouldn't hold my breath."

I completely forgot about the flamethrower and it took at least four or five tries but it's doable. The best way I found to do it is take out as many of the slow zombies as possible, use Moira to pry the door open and then use Claire as bait.  Have her run around the other end of the room by the cells, using whatever you can do keep the big guys off of Moira.  I think I managed to kill one of them before she got the door open and by then, I was low on health and made a run for it.  All I can say is good luck and remember to dodge with circle...'cause I forgot about that, too."

residentevil,2x8e53,Zaeh,4,Thu Feb 26 14:11:53 2015 UTC,"It's the same way for me.  I thought the horror elements in revelation 2 is just trying too hard.  It seems like the Creator/Director for this game is just trying to shove ""horror"" down our throats with all the hanging bodies, torture devices, blood everywhere, etc.  It actually reminds me a little bit of The Evil Within, just because of the over-the-top horror direction.  I think they really need to learn to imply horror.  Implication and self-interpretation of horror is often more effective.  For example the PT silent hills demo."
residentevil,2x8e53,Zaeh,5,Thu Feb 26 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"As you already mentioned Remake, another example of self-interpretation in the series is the information you got on the environment by examining it, in older REs. ""Looks like someone has vomited blood here"" and ""Footsteps go through the bed"" (paraphrasing both) are great examples from Remake, of that 'fridge horror' esque style that the older games had."
residentevil,2x8e53,chan_jkh,9,Thu Feb 26 14:24:10 2015 UTC,"The dialogue isn't the best, but at the same time it looks like they're making it somewhat intentionally humourous and cheesy. I get more ""B-movie vibe"" from this (which is actually a positive in my book), unlike some recent games that didn't have the best script but took itself way too seriously. I didn't like the FMVs, but other than that I don't really have a problem with the graphics. I like that they have a secondary character that tries to push exploration. That said, Natty's ""pointing"" is stupid (I can't pick it up unless I point at it!). I mean it would be a little better if she could still pick it up, but pointing just makes it visible to Barry or something (then you can write it off as ""she saw something he didn't notice"").  When they did voice actor changes in recent titles, the characters at least kinda sound similar. New Claire sounds nothing like Alyson Court, which kinda bugs me. Chris went to Rockfort immediately when Claire got captured in CV. Chris is noticeably absent when Claire is presumably missing for 6 months... I hope this gets addressed... I'm gonna just throw my guesses now: I think Moira's gun-related trauma had something to do with Polly or Barry's wife. I don't have a solid basis, but for something to be so traumatic that she wouldn't even use a gun to defend herself... Not to mention there's been no reference to Barry having a second daughter at the moment."
residentevil,2x8e53,chan_jkh,1 point,Thu Feb 26 15:32:05 2015 UTC,"You see, I think Resident Evil should take itself more seriously.  Just because it had always been a more serious title.  The change in direction doesn't help the series, it's what pisses most fans off, I think.  I am getting tired of all the games eventually becoming humors, and I don't understand why being too serious is a bad thing.  Maybe Chris went fishing for 6 months on his boat in the mean time lol"
residentevil,2x8e53,thespectreofcapital,3,Thu Feb 26 15:38:25 2015 UTC,"Because the series always had a bit of a b-movie nature, whether intentional or not. Capcom devs can't seem to consistently decide on whether to embrace it or not).  IMO, Sudden tone shifts work if the series had a reboot or if different games were completely unrelated (a la Final Fantasy). But the series is one long connected story, so it just seems jarring and out of place.  IIRC, Both Prince of Persia Warrior Within and Shadow the Hedgehog both had similar changes and people weren't happy about it either (I mean, yeah PoP:WW's is kinda justified in story too, but people still hated it and wanted SoT's prince back)."
residentevil,2x8e53,inmicrocosm,1 point,Fri Feb 27 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"RE has never consistently been a ""serious"" title. Some games took themselves more seriously (RE5, RE6, RE3) and some were pretty campy (RE4 with it's cheesy dialogue, the Napoleon little person and his huge mechanical statue and don't forget RE:CV's cross dressing mentally unstable antagonist)."
residentevil,2x8e53,theblackoctopus23,5,Sat Feb 28 00:08:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I found some of the design choices in the campaign pretty disappointing. Eventually it became clear that without a co-op partner, you have to play as Moira most of the time or you're going to have a really tough time. Her AI is incredibly useless, so I often found myself switching to her manually despite the fact I don't think she's all that fun to play as. On top of needing to use her to conserve ammo, you also miss out on finding a lot of it if you're not playing her because the AI doesn't point out shiny objects outside the initial tutorial letting you know they exist. The AI is equally problematic for Claire, as it seems no matter who you're playing the other character is content to stand still and get their ass beat rather than run away. Maybe it's better once you unlock the skill to have Claire use her guns when you're not playing as her. I haven't tried it yet.    But hey, I went into it knowing I was likely going to spend most of my time on the raid mode, and that's what I've been doing so far. It's a little too easy maybe, but it's good fun and I'm glad the mode wasn't just a one shot with Revelations.   On the plus side, the story's off to a much better start than I expected, even if the intro felt very contrived. I'm also in love with the idea that Barry's been telling the same cheesy stories about his glory days in Resident Evil 1 over-and-over again."
residentevil,2x8e53,DivineEmbers,5,Thu Feb 26 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"Man nobodies talking about raid mode?  That's what's going to keep me coming back! I watched a few streams of some guys that are up there in level, I can't wait for the challenge."
residentevil,2x8e53,DivineEmbers,2,Thu Feb 26 15:49:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't gotten the chance to play Raid mode yet, I am still on Barry's play though on episode 1.  Raid mode seems pretty cool, saw some silly taunt that killed monsters and chuckled a bit."
residentevil,2x8e53,DivineEmbers,3,Thu Feb 26 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"It's painfully linear, if it fixed that it'd be a much better game in my books.  Revelations 1 at least had optional areas to explore, backtrack and a nice complete setting.  Revelations 2 is just gonna be another linear Reaident Evil game."
residentevil,2x8e53,LexCrunch,4,Thu Feb 26 19:55:59 2015 UTC,"Personally don't think there's anything wrong with games being linear, that's just my taste."
residentevil,2x8e53,Krusiv,3,Thu Feb 26 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"I don't hate linear games, I actually really enjoyed some like Final Fantasy XIII (I know, heresy) but for horror games, backtracking and exploration IMO are absolutely vital, they flesh out a world and make it more personal.  Spencer Mansion when you beat Remake is more akin to a second home, you know inside and out, rather than a level in a game."
residentevil,2x8e53,HobbieK,3,Thu Feb 26 20:21:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I see what you mean.  That is true, because with a game like the current REs, it make the level design forgettable."
residentevil,2x8e53,Nikedawg,2,Thu Feb 26 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, Dark Souls and REmake are two of the most well designed games ever made IMO, because they encourage positive exploration and have world building through backtracking and such.  It really makes the games feel living and breathing without insane graphic, physics, weather or other dynamics games use to try and make games feel alive."
residentevil,2x8e53,Ninjaelk2k7,3,Thu Feb 26 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think the campaign is all that fun, especially not Claire's bit. Moira gets health back over time for some reason, so I put her on point and have her soak up damage while we do the flashlight combo and kill everything. Barry's part was better, but Natalia is just not fun to play. The whole game reminds me too much of The Last of Us. Raid mode is great so far, though."
residentevil,2x8e53,iash91,2,Thu Feb 26 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying it so far for the most part. Hopefully Capcom has a way to keep the gameplay interesting throughout the other episodes. I found myself playing the partner character a lot more than the main character, because utility. The ""search and destroy"" gameplay dynamic with Natalia wasn't boring per-se, but it made Barry's chapter feel too easy.  My current major gripe about the game is the transition from room to room. Every other door leads to this fade-to-black sequence which might as well be a loading screen.   The first Revelations didn't have those unless you were transitioning out of one major area and into a new one. In REV1 you could go from room to room as a single ""segment"" as if they were connected. It made the Queen Zenobia feel like an actual place you are exploring. The prison in REV2 lacks that feeling. It's like Capcom forgot to take the segment dividers out of the game before it was released.  This makes the game's linearity even more apparent."
residentevil,2x8e53,ClaireRedfieldAllDay,2,Fri Feb 27 22:11:54 2015 UTC,"The story is a step up from Revelations 1, but I hate the linearity of the levels for the claire/moira segment.   Moira is an interesting alternate to Claire, but Natalia is no fun to play as. She's a half step above Ashley, but without being actively annoying.   So far its like a 6 or 7 out of ten. Which is a little below Rev 1 for me.  Its better than RE6, and about tied with RE5, but without the horrid third act of RE5 that just sucks when all the enemies have guns."
residentevil,2x8e53,ChrisDalf,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on Natalia is that she's just a RE2 sherry clone, but much more useful.  I think pointing out shit on the floor and all of a sudden something is there seems extremely unreasonable, considering Barry has a flash light.  Maybe Barry is partially blind?  Moira's edge remind me a little bit of Steve Burnside, but then Steve was much more likable, especially towards the end.  I hope Moira develops better."
residentevil,2x8e53,DivineEmbers,2,Thu Feb 26 14:41:29 2015 UTC,"I'm really enjoying it so far. I've been a huge RE fan though so I might be a bit bias... I would like it better if I could play online coop with a friend of mine but even single player I'm really enjoying it. However I don't like the reliance on playing the character that can ""spot"" things... I like Barry's partner because at least I can see enemies and know where they are and identify how to kill them quicker. Moira just feels like an extra, I wish the AI would finish people off after I knock them down too instead I have to quickly switch over to Moira and use her finisher. Raid mode however is addicting as hell and I'm really looking forward to playing that with friends.   My biggest complaint however is the PC version, I had major FPS issues even though I never had any issues with games like RE6 and I can play several other games fine but for whatever reason my FPS drops to almost nothing at the start of Raid matches and it happened a few times throughout the campaign. I got so frustrated with it that I bought it again for PS4... so now I'm playing on that platform and will play the PC version whenever they allow raid mode online with a friend of mine lol >_> More money for them I guess..."
residentevil,2x8e53,ChrisDalf,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"Some people reported issues with the PC versions, I didn't have any issue myself so I got lucky.  I do like Barry's game play just like you said, Moira is kind of like a detector, which makes the game play slightly ""stealth"".  Reminds me a bit of Metal Gear (Metal FEAR).  I think co-op is coming soon for the PC correct?  Just not local."
residentevil,2x8e53,PrimeDildo,2,Thu Feb 26 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"I'm getting sick of Capcoms way of transplanting Red herrings, like them saying someone is dead and them not being dead for the sake of drama."
residentevil,2x8e53,PrimeDildo,2,Fri Feb 27 02:47:49 2015 UTC,"I'm actually enjoying it a lot. I went into the game expecting to play RE5 2.0, but I was pleasantly surprised. The graphics aren't good, but the gameplay makes up for it. It's not classic resident evil, but it's a great balance. Far better than what RE6 was. The soundtrack is really nice too, it certainly adds to the atmosphere. The only issues I have (if we are talking survival horror aspect) is that the enemies feel like they are a bit easy to take down, and they send numerous enemies at you. I don't really feel danger from them, still empowerment. I'd like to see the gameplay slowed down a tiny bit in some aspects (crouching moves too fast, doesn't feel like you're really stealthing it,etc). Overall, I got very resident evil 4 meets forbidden siren vibes from it, which is a great combo in my eyes. It needs tweaking, a bigger budget for visuals and refinement, but finally Capcom are doing something well."
residentevil,2x8e53,DafarheezyRises,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"I recommend just starting the game on survival. It really does increase the quality of the gameplay and the need to conserve ammo/avoid enemies. I found that at the end of Claire's segment I was practically begging for the chapter to end, I was actually scared of the possibility of running into more enemies. Which has only ever happened to me in one other game, RE2. Barry/Natalie's chapter was very refreshing, and I found myself playing as Natalia and enjoying the dynamics her special powers introduced. Barry was, as always, a badass and took away a bit of the fear factor until I reached the forest, which again, had me scared.   Raid mode is beastly and I can't wait to unlock some more characters/missions for it. It seems very fleshed out as far as customization and rewards go.  All in all I give this game an 8-9/10 just based on the first episode which was very pleasing. (Though I don't know if I would've enjoyed the game as much if I hadn't immediately jumped into Survival mode.) As long as it maintains the quality then I might just call this a 10/10.  Extra: People are complaining about the game being linear but if we'll be exploring areas twice thanks to a time skip then I feel as if people would have only gotten annoyed with having to search giant areas again and again. I think the game has a pretty decent amount of side-areas to explore when taking the time skip into account."

But then he died, so who knows."
residentevil,2x8e53,Goodsp33d,0,Fri Feb 27 19:51:21 2015 UTC,"It would be great if  A) The toggle button between characters worked half of the time (any other Xbox users having this issue?  Even when the bubble is lit up?)  B) Facial consistency... Claire's features keep changing.  C) The Claire Sandwich line was hilarious, especially Moira's response to it.  D) The menu is kind of odd.  I wish it was more like RE5 to be honest.    E) Like the weapons system, but I don't remember a gun in RE ever taking that long to load even at its lowest level.  F) Changed the controls to C-1 because of how stiff they felt.  I still have issues with moving around the crosshairs.  Story wise- If Natalia ends up being Wesker's daughter, I will seriously break shit.  Also, this game is giving me an Outlast kind of vibe.  And the ""infected look like pirate zombies from a Scooby Doo movie :/  I'm a huge horror game/anime/comic fan, so I get really critical on monster design.  But I still have to see some more of the monsters before I can really judge.    I like Moira's character to a degree.  And of course Barry is a badass, like usual :D  Claire is still kind of bland in this game.  And Terra Save, oh jebus whoever came up with that line of copy at the end of the ad needs to be punched in the face..."

I don't think the different gestures have different damage values, but Hip-Hop Dance acts instantly, is indefinitely sustainable, and can be canceled almost immediately. It gives you a relatively safe defensive and offensive force field that can do surprising amounts of damage, killing common enemies in one or two hits if you focus on leveling just that one skill. I like to use it aggressively by canceling it over and over with a short movement, or defensively to kill the dog things or any other beasties that might die in one hit by watching them try to get at me.  Let's Do This is fast and short, and the only reason you'd use it over Hip-Hop Dance is because it has a higher propensity for hitting things in higher places like the head, giving you melee stuns and an opportunity to hit elevated weak spots.  I have no idea if this skill is actually good, but it's been carrying my Gina up to level 20 so far, relying almost entirely on Hip-Hop Dance kills. I'm looking forward to maxing this so Moira can inherit it and I can have a stupid melee build for laughs."

You're given a handful of achievements and other things to play with to keep you plenty occupied while getting hyped for the next episode. I think it's fun trying to keep up, and that if Revelations becomes a larger sub-franchise it could work as part of its appeal.  Mainstream installments do not need to adopt that model, though."
residentevil,2x8sc8,LexCrunch,2,Thu Feb 26 18:45:50 2015 UTC,"I agree. I like the whole Revelations sub series. A good way to try new things, revelations 1 was good for a handheld full Resi game and it translated quite well to console. Now they're able to try new things and I guess if it's not in the main series if it doesn't go well then it won't have such a negative impact on the series, although I think they've made a good choice with this one.

residentevil,2x7t5g,Ivalance,2,Thu Feb 26 09:03:58 2015 UTC,Yeah have a similar problem with having hardware close to yours. The frame rate drops all the time and quite honestly it gives me a headache. I think the game is just really poorly optimized for PC I don't think there's anything you can do about it until there's an update release.  RE6 ran perfectly on my computer with all high graphic settings. In this game I had to turn down everything and holy crap it is awful looking.
residentevil,2x7t5g,FrozenGasoline,2,Thu Feb 26 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree that is not a very good port job. Capcom frustrates me with how inconsistent they are with their PC port. Some of them are amazing, DMC 4, RE5 and RE6 run and look great, but this game's performance fluctuate too much. Which is a shame because I really like the game mechanics a hell lot, it's really fun.  By the way, turning down shadows etc don't do much for me. But turning down resolution gives a pretty ample boost of FPS. Of course it looks a little bit muddy but it scales pretty well."
residentevil,2x7t5g,FrozenGasoline,2,Thu Feb 26 17:32:46 2015 UTC,"See I was thinking of scaling down the resolution, but then I thought I shouldn't have to do that just for it to play properly...buuut I ended up doing it anyway and I did what you did, scale to native res.

residentevil,2x875t,Ryokyon,1 point,Thu Feb 26 12:45:03 2015 UTC,"There are voice commands, but only like 5 or so. Yeah, why wouldn't you be able to play as the DLC characters?"
residentevil,2x875t,chofortu,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:12:24 2015 UTC,"I think you unlock more. Not sure if commands, but there's deffo emotes to unlock since I unlocked one called ""rock"" which is the rock motion from the game rock, paper, scissors."

Not seeing further calls for Wesker directly some of the files, I haven't finished looking at the moment as we've spent most of the day trying to figure out the audio format.  Will report back if I fish out more textures but for now, Claire's TerraSave and Barry's B.S.A.A. gear are just outright sitting in the files at the moment and I know these were mentioned on the Japanese sites as being available as DLC codes if you purchased the physical clothing replicas."

I've recorded some videos and tweeted about it, but getting nothing back as far as anyone else having this problem. I play with Moira on one level and then it freezes after and I can no longer access Raid mode even after restarting the game. I reinstalled it this morning, played level 2 of Raid mode with Moira and it was fine. When I tried level 3 I finished it and once again it stopped working. Every other character I've played so far works, but if I play Moira then it freezes the game. Reinstalling the game, rebooting the system, waiting for it to load.. I've done many things to try and fix this but it keeps happening, but only after using Moira."

All this time I was thinking Barry's section was gonna be easy with the amount of ammo he has but noooooo.Wasted so much ammo on those abominations and I refused to use the Magnum thinking there's gonna be a major boss fight.  The part when you're in the forest and Natalia couldn't detect worth shit. This game would definitely be perfect if it was just Barry and Natalia."

residentevil,2x54wz,Fatness,0,Thu Feb 26 04:12:17 2015 UTC,"I honestly like the story a lot more than the actual game. I started on the hardest difficulty and just walloped everything by tanking with Moira. For some reason, she gets her health back over time and doesn't need herbs. If she dies, you can control Claire to get her back up. I had the two of them do the flashlight-kick-crowbar combo on nearly every single monster until they died, and it was silly. Didn't have to use any ammo besides a couple of shells on the very last bit.  I don't have as much to say about Barry's part besides the fact that it was actually really good, or at least way better, but I feel sorry for anyone in a co-op session who gets stuck playing Natalia and doing almost nothing. I could have also done without the stealth. It's one of dozens of parallels I kept drawing to The Last of Us. It's not nearly as bad or anywhere near as boring as The Last of Us, but it was easy to see where the inspiration was coming from.  Story is fun, cliffhanger was good, Moira is a fun character to have around, Barry is great, and Natalia is cute as hell. Can't wait to see what happens next, but I'm honestly not terribly thrilled to actually play it. I bought it for the raid mode, and at least that didn't disappoint."

Zombies walked in to walls, moira got stuck in 2 zombies and a door and just walked around in a circle. Claire waisted bunch of ammo. When i wanted her to shoot she never did and justgot hit and died. It was no side exploration it was just follow the road they wanted u to go, you couldnt explore by your own. This is just like re5 and re6 nothing like re rev was. The game is horrible on all ways.  Plus its super bad optimized.  like here. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13092928/MIRILLIS/rerev2%202015-02-26%2006-38-41-39.jpg i had 100% on gpu but 30 fps in some rooms.  some other rooms my cpu were 100% and 50 fps.   meanwhile otherrooms i had cpu on 45% and gpu on 35% with 120 fps. This game is horrible and shouldt of been release at all its so bad and i regret my decision on buying it.

Everyone got the right to critic. But it does not mean that because on your PC it runs bad that it runs bad on every PC. I have friend that can play Skyrim and Fallout perfectly. But  my computer Crash all the time on those and i have  a decent rig.   Did you try activating mouse acceleration or reduce your aiming   sensibility my friend and i put it on 2.

Wouldt suprise me if u havent updated the important  windows updates or are using a pirate version  of the game.  Btw  i have tried it on 2 and its to fast later 1 is to slow its laggy goes slow later fast and slow again like mouse acc is on but  it is off and i would never ever use window acc in a game with a mouse its horrible.
residentevil,2x5v2b,Tetherline,2,Wed Feb 25 22:15:54 2015 UTC,I played the whole episode on PC and had significant frame rate issues.  There's tons of people having this problem and reporting it on steam. The fanboys are quick to start screaming about specs but my PC is a beast and plays everything else on ultrahigh settings.

residentevil,2x5v2b,MrGutzy,1 point,Wed Feb 25 23:57:38 2015 UTC,I doubt it's anything fundamental. RE6 had a similar problem in the beginning. I think it can be patched.

residentevil,2x5v2b,code_nomad,2,Thu Feb 26 01:15:09 2015 UTC,Its horrible optimized.  Some spots my gpu is on 100% with 30-40 fps and cpu on 20%. Later i have 100% on cpu and like 20% on gpu with 30-40 fps.  And normally 40-50% cpu later like 50% gou with 120 fps.  Its not bad specs its the game that is horrible optimized with zones.

You need a weaker weapon so that you can get melee kills to keep adding 5 seconds of bonus time since your remaining time is tallied together for extra score after clearing all 150 bad guys. You'll probably get a good rank based on how many dudes you kill, but don't expect to top score.  On that note, Tribal Sheva is one of the worst characters for this reason."

They can just make a digital manual and save costs on producing it. The amount of people who actually look at the manual is not enough to warrant including a physical copy. I don't look at manuals anymore since everything is usually explained within the context of the game, and it is more effective since you can easily demonstrate it firsthand. Manuals were needed in the 1980s when games didn't have enough storage space to spare on tutorials and the like. It's a left-over tradition that's no longer needed anymore."

Assuming the rest are like that you have 4 episodes+ 2 bonus episodes. 2-3 times 6 comes to 12-18 hours of core gameplay. Not counting raid mode. That's pretty good for $40. Compare that to a game like The Order ($60) which people are savaging for being only 6 hours or something (with no additional modes/ online) and we RE fans got a good deal! A long game for less money

Like I think it's in her adaption of RE2 it starts with The STARS members talking about leaving town. Just kinda neat little stuff that fleshes out the characters. I enjoyed the part where the STARS flee Vickers house after Umbrella sends agents after them.    As far as her original RE novels go like Caliban Cove, I don't particularly like the story/ new monsters created...but I really really prefer her overall plot as opposed to how the series ended up going. Leon joining Rebecca and the STARS covert fight against Umbrella to me feels more right. It feels like that's what should have been. With STARS being this national organization similar to how the BSAA kind of is now is preferred. I don't really like the route they took with Leon becoming this super special agent and doing away with Umbrella in the first minute of RE4 and never touching on the old STARS members again (until now). I think Perry's vision for the direction the story would take matches my own opinion of what should have been."
residentevil,2x1qxk,The_Naked_Snake,2,Tue Feb 24 23:47:19 2015 UTC,"I read them all as they were released and I can confirm that the novelizations are great, but the original works are weaker. You said something that I've never considered before though. S.D. Perry did have a better vision for the direction of the series. Umbrella was basically written out of the script at the beginning of 4 in such a way that we, the gamers, were denied the catharsis of defeating them. I do remember being pretty disappointed by that back in the day when 4 came out. You can't just give us an evil corporation to hate and then make them suddenly disappear in an FMV... As a flippin side note."
residentevil,2x1qxk,fromthesaveroom,3,Wed Feb 25 23:16:17 2015 UTC,Own the whole series. Pretty entertaining
residentevil,2x1qxk,nocturnalpr1de,2,Tue Feb 24 23:41:17 2015 UTC,"I'm actually in the middle of reading the first one. The one based on Resident Evil 1, published in 1998.. not Resident Evil 0.  It's good, but wouldn't be a good read without the fan context. Some really interesting back stories on the characters, and perspectives on characters that are behind the scenes in the game, like Wesker e.g.  Kind of funny, but in S.D. Perry's lore, Jill Valentine's father was a master thief and criminal, which is why she is the master of unlocking, lol"
residentevil,2x1qxk,bat_mayn,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:38:04 2015 UTC,"Wasn't that somewhere in the 3rd game as well? Did I just infuse that part of the book into the real canon? It's been so long, but I've almost always known Jill as an ex-criminal. It said in the books she was involved herself iirc."
residentevil,2x1qxk,the--mannequin,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:37:32 2015 UTC,I really think that backstory suits her better than the Delta Force army training.
residentevil,2x1qxk,bat_mayn,2,Wed Feb 25 00:46:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I appreciate the earlier lore more than the post-trilogy stuff. It was more humble. All the characters weren't elite superheroes or comic supervillains."
residentevil,2x1qxk,News_Bot,2,Wed Feb 25 00:48:56 2015 UTC,"S.T.A.R.S. were mostly recruited from various U.S. military units. Jill was a soldier in the U.S. Army, so the Delta Force training program fits her better and adds something ""special"" to her considering there are no women in Delta Force or related units. Delta Force training involves lock-picking, too."
residentevil,2x1qxk,Knight_Doppler,2,Wed Feb 25 01:12:11 2015 UTC,Delta Force don't accept women into their ranks.

But I have not went back and read them sense then do I don't know if they still hold up.
residentevil,2x1qxk,potzdamn,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:02:58 2015 UTC,I've read the entire series over 20 times easily. It's my favourite book series probably of all time (this or newsflesh trilogy).   I found Underworld to be my favourite novel in the series. Least favourite would be Caliban Cove or CV.   They couldve made movies based off the books/games and I think they would've been received a lot better.

residentevil,2x1qxk,the--mannequin,1 point,Wed Feb 25 08:38:21 2015 UTC,Pretty good actually. It's been a couple of years since I read one of these but I probably have to dig them out of some boxes sooner or later. I remember liking the original material added to the stories.

They're great, they really capture the story and characters and elaborate on them in a way that the games failed to do. They feel 100% canon and they are pretty well written, especially by resident evil standards. I read them all about 10 years ago but I'd still recommend them to any fan after all this time. The ones based on 2, 3 and CV are the best."
residentevil,2x1qxk,Pointwest418,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"I just read the first one over vacation.  It wasn't great writing or anything, but it kept me very entertained as it followed the game along and provided interesting story.  edit: SD Perry's first one"
residentevil,2x1qxk,Pointwest418,2,Tue Feb 24 23:28:24 2015 UTC,"You can skip the second one (Caliban Cove). It's a non-canon story, littered with non-canon characters. The only reason to read it is to be able to follow the fourth one (Underworld), because it has a lot of the same characters.  The only ones worth reading are City of the Dead, and Code:Veronica.  EDIT: By non-canon, I mean completely Perry's creation."

residentevil,2x3uoc,BossAtlas,15,Wed Feb 25 12:51:49 2015 UTC,"The bad acting and voice work was never deliberate, the devs had no idea what it sounded like, they just thought an American voice cast would sound cool. Look at the massively improved dialogue and acting of RE2. RE1 was never meant to be ""B movie"", the Japanese devs thought they where making a very serious and gritty horror game."
residentevil,2x3uoc,Sissle,4,Wed Feb 25 13:44:05 2015 UTC,They even spoke out and said they regretted the casting of actors with little to no experience.

residentevil,2x3uoc,Sissle,10,Wed Feb 25 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"Same reason they changed the graphics: it could be massively improved upon. The voice acting in RE1, while we love it for its cheesiness, was both poorly scripted and delivered."
residentevil,2x3uoc,thedude2618,-6,Wed Feb 25 13:15:45 2015 UTC,"That's the point though, it was iconic for that. Why remove it? Resident evil is like a b-movie, it should keep the corny dialogue."
residentevil,2x3uoc,thedude2618,7,Wed Feb 25 13:20:53 2015 UTC,"REmake wasn't like a B movie though. The corny, badly-delivered and poorly-translated dialogue would have seemed out of place."

residentevil,2x3uoc,bat_mayn,4,Wed Feb 25 13:38:36 2015 UTC,"It was never the point, lol - just poor dialogue and probably not a good translation. While it's a legendary thing amongst the fans, it was never their intention to have embarrassing B-dialogue.  The original is still available if you love it so :)"
residentevil,2x3uoc,AppleChiaki,3,Wed Feb 25 20:49:05 2015 UTC,"I think the sound quality of the original wasn't great, so even if they were to keep it they'd have to re-record it all so it wouldn't sound echoey and out of place. And that kind of corny is hard to get if you try for it."
residentevil,2x3uoc,eharsh87,2,Wed Feb 25 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"I doubt they were ever going to use the original audio (since it was hilariously terrible - hilarrible?), but the sound quality between the PS1 and GameCube was insane.  The voice acting for Metal Gear Solid, for example, was recorded in someone's apartment instead of an actual recording booth.  With the GCN's enhanced sound quality you'd be able to hear the traffic from outside in-game if they'd use the original audio.  That said, with how iconic PSX RE's dialogue has become, I really wish there was a way to switch audio tracks.  Capcom's 100% aware of how awesomely bad the RE1 dialogue is - Remember Deadly Silence? They had to record new dialogue for Richard because of the DS's touch screen/microphone CPR gimmic-  I mean feature.  If anything, the new dialogue is even cheesier.  They were certainly in on the joke at that point."
residentevil,2x3uoc,Zaeh,3,Wed Feb 25 17:05:10 2015 UTC,"It wasn't iconic, it was infamous. Only the original game was truly campy and B-movie-like, for reasons that weren't deliberate, and like already mentioned it could now be improved upon."
residentevil,2x3uoc,deadman343,-5,Wed Feb 25 16:48:54 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way, what if they remade all the evil dead movies to a tee, but changed the dialogue to make it more ""serious""  Then it wouldn't be evil dead. It'd be serious Bruce Campbell being serious.  When cheesiness is iconic of the thing in question, changing it is a crime."
residentevil,2x3uoc,News_Bot,8,Wed Feb 25 15:15:47 2015 UTC,Evil Dead is intentionally cheesy. BIO is not.
residentevil,2x3uoc,deadman343,-3,Wed Feb 25 16:27:20 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but the cheesiness of biohazard has become iconic, that was my point. You can't change something iconic, you at least have to have some references to it or something."
residentevil,2x3uoc,News_Bot,6,Wed Feb 25 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"It isn't iconic, there are just a handful of people that get all giddy about it. ""Infamous"" is a better word, and it really only applies to the first game."
residentevil,2x3uoc,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"But they have? Forgetting the fact that a lot of people consider Evil Dead 2 just a remake of Evil Dead, they remade Evil Dead in 2013. It's the same story, but with reimagined characters, more serious acting, and ""better graphics""."
residentevil,2x3uoc,deadman343,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"both are equally as cheesy, the first one just tried to take itself seriously."
residentevil,2x3uoc,EQUASHNZRKUL,2,Wed Feb 25 19:00:06 2015 UTC,The Same reason they made the REmake. So that it would lose the low-budget image it got from RE.
residentevil,2x3uoc,Dimnos,3,Wed Feb 25 13:50:20 2015 UTC,The first 5 minutes of the game was Barry asking what everything was. They wanted REmake for the Gamecube to be successful and improving the graphics and design of the game would have been severely let down if the dialogue in the game was RE1 levels of terrible.
residentevil,2x3uoc,News_Bot,4,Wed Feb 25 17:18:46 2015 UTC,"The horrible dialogue was never intended. It was the result of a botched localization by a translator with a very bad grasp of English. On top of this, Mikami was inexperienced with English voice acting and gave instructions he later regretted, such as asking the actors to speak very slowly. The voice director (Rebecca's VA) also had no experience and botched the recording sessions quite badly."
residentevil,2x3uoc,ngxp,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:05:42 2015 UTC,"At least it wasn't the remake of Symphony of the Night. They removed the ""What is a man: a miserable pile of secrets"" opening exchange. It'd be one thing if that line was unintentionally funny like Master of Unlocking, but that exchange actually owned."
residentevil,2x3uoc,chumjumper,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:55:46 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the Xbox360 version of SotN? Because the dialogue in that is exactly the same as the original, nothing was cut out."

I personally prefer to have physical copies of my games, as I like to have a physical representation towards what I waste my money on, but I am very impatient and want to play this game with my girlfriend, now.

But if they package it together with the main game, I no longer notice! I can plug my ears and pretend I bought a full game chock full of extras just like you used to be able to do.   3) It comes out shortly before my birthday, so I will very likely get it as a present. But for those not so fortunate, you can take comfort in the knowledge that physical releases drop in price much quicker than digital games. The physical version of the game will be $20 some day while the full digital version will still be $25 without all the DLC frivolities.

I actually think the way it does it in Rev2 is worse because it takes you completely away from the setting. With the door, you're still there, plus there's a tiny bit of suspense added."

I imagine it is to ""teleport"" whichever character is not close to the door, so that you're both together. It makes sense that they would do that instead of the player's character just magically teleporting across the room. Give a quick fade in and fade out and it is masked."

But it certainly isn't anything like the original RE series, much more closer to re4 then anything. I'm okay with that, but I still feel like they are having trouble finding a balance. The main issue I believe is the enemies. They are STILL just bullet sponges, no real dread. And the gameplay seems to be a bit too fast still."
residentevil,2wzkou,iash91,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:11:38 2015 UTC,It took something like 7 bullets to fully kill a zombie in RE.
residentevil,2wzkou,bokuwahmz,1 point,Wed Feb 25 07:54:18 2015 UTC,"Valid point... Very valid. I guess it was primarily that they were more dangerous, harder to kill, and their attacks were far more fatal. Meeting one could mean the death of a healthy player. Whereas, what i meant by bullet sponges with the new enemies, is they are weak, come in numbers and are easy to kill, all so you feel 'bro-dude badass'. That ain't surviving!"
residentevil,2wzkou,iash91,1 point,Wed Feb 25 08:22:21 2015 UTC,We're RE2 and RE3 just as good as the first?   Also do you think CAPCOM ever make Hs remasters for them on PC like they did with one?  I'm having a blast with one right now but this back tracking is killing me lol.
residentevil,2wzkou,Makaveli777,2,Tue Feb 24 22:27:20 2015 UTC,"RE2? That was miles ahead of RE1 which bothers me they focus on RE1 remakes and remasters.  Sure both were basically the same game(Sort of), but RE1 had a mansion, then an underground place. It was a lot smaller then RE2. RE2 had a very fleshed out story, lot's of diverse areas and special modes, was much longer and way more area to explore. Though of course in RE1 it was mansion/underground testing area(More or less). RE2 had you travel a ways to get to a police station, then uncover the clues, then make it down into an extensive sewer system then to the big underground testing place. The overall boss was IMO much more interesting.  But I have to admit; given the choice as a company I might say remake RE1 because it's more iconic. Everyones first experience with survival horror was most likely RE1, people remember it more even if RE2 was overall a better game.  RE3 though? Ehhh it has a lot of people who really love it... But I don't find it was that great or good. It wasn't even a true sequel. RE2 was, RE3 was going to be a filler game(Short and sweet, first title was simply RE: Nemesis IIRC) and RE4 was set to be RE3. Some stuff occured, development schedules changed and they released it as RE3. It was never intended to be the true sequel to RE and it shows, it was more along the lines of most side stories RE has.... Which is a lot.  Not that it's a bad game, I just found it lacking and you could tell instead of building a story and introducing a big bad, they built the story around the big bad, like other RE side stories did.  However also remember: RE1 is a remaster of the RE1 Game Cube remake. So it was extremely easy to simply just update the textures and make them cleaner, add a mode or two. To remaster RE2 or RE3... Would be difficult to say the least. You'd pretty much need to remake both games which costs several times more and a lot of resources then RE remaster we just got.  I hope they do bring RE2 though, it is my favourite RE game. If you don't mind bad graphics give it a shot. It still for the most part holds up."
residentevil,2wzkou,Cizuz,1 point,Wed Feb 25 12:13:22 2015 UTC,"unfortunately I don't have a desire to buy a Playstation 1 to play it, but after watching a couple minutes of gameplay and some reviews, its rather tempting. Even the gunshots sound better. Definitely looks like and upgrade from RE1. Check the link below, apparently they're working on it. Just hope they bring it to PC.  http://n4g.com/news/1562426/capcom-working-on-resident-evil-2-hd-slated-for-september-2015-release-date"
residentevil,2wzkou,Makaveli777,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:20:50 2015 UTC,Also check this out. Apparently some chick already remade an HD version of the game that'll unfortunately never be released to the public. She made it with the Unreal Engine just to teach herself how to use it I think.

Who knows if they will make remakes... it seems to make sense given the huge sales of the remaster, but Capcom play by their own rules."

residentevil,2wzkou,DivineEmbers,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the campaign so far, but only for one reason, the switching characters. Back in REV 1 I found it annoying to have to use the scanner to find items, now I have to switch to another character to scan.... which means I played 90% of the game as the secondary characters, and only switched to the mains to kill stuff. I didn't find it much fun to be running around pointing my finger or a torch into every nook and cranny looking for items.  That said I'm not too bothered, I bought this game for raid mode, and so far it has been a huge improvement on REV 1's raid mode.   I'll play the campaign for unlocks, but my main focus and where I'll get my money's worth will be raiding."
residentevil,2wzkou,AppleChiaki,0,Wed Feb 25 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"Still going to wait until it's fully released, and even then I don't want to buy it. I don't support this season bullshit."
residentevil,2wzkou,soliddewitt,3,Tue Feb 24 23:11:10 2015 UTC,"The thing about the episodes is that its not the same as telltale. I really hate this new episodic trend (which is why I'm not playing Life is Strange), but these ""episodes"" aren't caused simply by lazy developers, its because they want to make Revelations 2 seem more like a TV show, and they want REv 2 to be a platform for them to add more lore and stuff, similar to *Destiny but instead is meant to give to the consumer, not milk the fuck out of a stupid demographic."
residentevil,2wzkou,Cizuz,-2,Wed Feb 25 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"You can't be further from the truth.  These episodic content, albeit many developers may do it for different reasons exist to bring us content we would of originally never seen.  Take one of the best(Albeit very strange) survival horror games Siren: Bloodcurse. Originally they wanted to bring it to PS3 but during development they simply... Almost ran out of funds. Not even joking, they completely overshot what they could accomplish in their budget. That said they had a game that had mechanics finished(For the most part) and at the same time games can have large sections, even the first half finished sometimes before being canceled.  So let's say you have a half finished game, running low on budget but want people to play your game, or even to get back what you put into your project, hell maybe you want to finish the game... Would people buy 1/5th of a game? Well yes they would. Siren was split up into 12 episodes, released into 1/4th chunks to try and test the market. It worked. They got funds, they finished the game over time releasing/finishing what was left over and we got an arguably pretty great experience. It even shifted focus to a whole ""LAST TIME, THIS TIME"" type of feel which I felt added to the experience.  So episodic content began. Of course there were some others, but mainly the first ones to do it were plagued with problems. Other smaller developers with big dreams and some semi finished or started projects now had a chance. Can't tell if anyone would buy TWD Tell Tale game? Make episode 1 for 1/10th he budget, sell it for a decent amount, and if it doesn't sell enough to finish future installments you cancel the series. It works.  Funny you should mention Life Is Strange, same issue happened they didn't have the total budget needed to complete it all, and as of now it's shaping up to be one of my most anticipated games. I will warn it's not for everyone, but it actually feels like my choices matter, the time travel gimmick works well, and the story is pretty engaging.  Though I will agree. It sometimes is the lazy way to do things, but games aren't cheap to develop. People also forget Capcom and other large devs don't just work on a single project, they have teams, people who pitch, people who tinker, people who test, people who develop(Several large and small teams) all fighting on what to do next. Can't make a huge game? Test it with episode one.  How do they do it so fast though? They have fucking hard schedules. If you have the mechanics done(A large part) and if you have the story written up, areas drawn out in advanced and you convince a developer to let you do the project you can get episode 1 out, rush to finish episode 2, episode 3 etc. The mechanics won't change, bugs should be a non issue in creating new areas, a lot of work and areas can be built very quickly. Worst case scenario? No one buys episode 1, it falls off the planet. Best case scenario? Your teams in trouble with your company and episode 1 sales will determine your future in making another series based on a certain concept.  So the only reason you're wrong is because these didn't start out as a cash grab, they started out to create content we would of never gotten. To be fair though; i'm sure some devs see it as a way to get more cash but not all of them. In fact most times 4 episodes equal or surpass some AAA games and end up costing half the money. Can't be upset about that as a gamer. It does suck waiting though.  Word of warning though: Never buy the season pass. Always get the first episode, if you like it buy the ""episode 2 to 4 pass"" that they usually have."
residentevil,2wzkou,Cizuz,1 point,Wed Feb 25 12:26:52 2015 UTC,"You literally just restated what I just said with the exception of REv 2, but told me I was wrong. REv 2 is different. You simply cannot create that much content in a matter of a week. It is humanly impossible. What the fuck is the point of writing up the story, drawing out areas, and making the mechanics for the game, if its just going to be released in a week later, and nearly all the people purchasing the game are purchasing all four episodes. That's the entire game! All that is added is the story and boss fights. Boss fights require developers to create new models, AI, and cutscenes. None of these things can be done in the following week. The only reason why REv 2 is episodic is because people gave REv episodes shit because episodes seemed really redundant and unnecessary. However, the developers wanted to make the REv series more like ""flashbacks"" or ""dreams"" similar to Chronicles, and refused to withdraw from its episodic format. So, they made them actual episodes this time. You simply cannot argue that one can make hours of content in the course of a week. All the episodes are also in closed release. People have already reviewed this content. There's no turning back."
residentevil,2wzkou,iash91,-3,Wed Feb 25 13:45:20 2015 UTC,"It is not humanly possible. Have you ever done game development?  Tight deadlines are a thing.  Also in some cases hype is real, people get excited, publisher sees people want the product and fund the rest of it completely. Should of been episodic, then they got more funding/episodic stuff was done, decided to keep it episodic.  Regardless I also said it may not be the case with this, but you stated as a fact it was just a cash grab and started due to that. That's not why it started, some devs use it right, some don't, hell i'm sure some even want the whole ""looks like a TV show feel"" but again; that's not it's intended original purpose.  Making an area? Easy. Creating mechanics for collision mechanics, creating models, creating characters and there own mechanics? Not so easy. Very hard in fact.  That's why I went into detail sometimes all mechanics are done, most models are done, the story is drawn up but due to development issues things get mucky.  You seem to think a game is made per area that each area has specific mechanics and needs to be always tailored towards that. That's severely not the case. Mechanics are always the hardest(Testing/getting rid of bugs) then comes story/planning then comes areas themselves. Areas are thrown together. Cutscenes are not hard to do.   Again though like I said I wasn't making a concrete statement about how the development occurred for this game but it is never as simple as ""THEY CAN'T FINISH THIS IN X AMOUNT OF TIME, THEY DID EPISODIC AS A CASH GRAB GUYS"" and by the way, the entire areas within episode 1 are pretty much a weeks worth for a competent 10 man team on hours game developers put in(10 men dedicated simply to area building). Especially since that shits always drawn up, models are done, textures are done and mechanics are done actually placing and building is the easy part.  Do yourself a favor, get a decent game engine with presupplied models, mechanics and textures. Drawn up a huge mansion and see how fast you can actually build it. It's not as long as you think. Episodic content is done sporadically where most of the heavy lifting is done, polishing and building the finishing touches as well as bug testing and budgetary concerns are what mainly bog them down."
residentevil,2wzkou,soliddewitt,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:55:11 2015 UTC,"I am a gave developer. I know how long this shit takes. You can't simply start a game, have it all ""planned out"" but not finish it because of money. In map development, it never ends up the way you plan. After everyone else has compiled their stuff into your map, only then can you make the map final. This is a creative industry, people get ideas out the wazoo. With 50 people, you simply could not create a single boss fight within 178 hours.   Also, if you have all this shit planned out, why the fuck would you wait. Don't give me that budgeting bullshit. People are still getting paid full time, and after the success of REmaster, people are pre-purchasing Rev 2. They have the money.   You have obviously never worked on a game if you think that a team as small as the REv team are able to complete an entire game in a month, even with the work ethic of a Mexican."
residentevil,2wzkou,iash91,1 point,Wed Feb 25 22:32:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kinda agree.

This is not the winning formula I wanted personally, longevity and Raid Mode doesn't really change that.  Especially since Revelations 1 was quite polished and strong in aspect,  great music, final boss, bosses, exploration for the for first part of the game."
residentevil,2x3azb,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track with the criticisms, but I'd have to disagree with the bottom line.  It's also a budget game priced at $25, and comes with the Raid Mode that's basically half of the game at this point.  Taking those points into account, and all you said, I would still recommend the game."
residentevil,2x3azb,Antoby,1 point,Wed Feb 25 12:18:55 2015 UTC,I played Raid mode yesterday and the frame rate dropped dramatically for some parts where I felt like I was going in slow mo. It was pretty bad. That really is my biggest complaint. The graphics are bad the FR shouldn't be this bad.
residentevil,2x3azb,Warruzz,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:54:18 2015 UTC,"The game is incredibly average, especially for it being made for home consoles/PC. They should of stuck with the portable roots of this series and made it 3DS and Vita only, this game is good when thinking of it in a handheld environment."
residentevil,2x1w01,EnixXIII,2,Wed Feb 25 00:03:30 2015 UTC,"I believe it's unlocked from the start, quit the campaign and go to the main menu.   You unlock the two locked characters by beating episode one."

residentevil,2x1w01,Kensike,1 point,Wed Feb 25 02:35:14 2015 UTC,A character named Cipher apparently. Seems like he is either unlockable now (if completion medals are obtainable by every character) or unlockable when there's 90 missions.

residentevil,2wz26g,realjohnnyfear,3,Tue Feb 24 11:34:17 2015 UTC,One thing I don't get is why Barry looks so different. It's especially noticeable coming straight from REmaster
residentevil,2wz26g,mrbubbamac,2,Tue Feb 24 11:49:23 2015 UTC,"He looks hilariously different. I mean even Chris from earlier games to RE5 looks very different, but if Barry wasn't wearing red I wouldn't have realized it was the same person."
residentevil,2wz26g,DivineEmbers,2,Tue Feb 24 19:44:53 2015 UTC,It looks like they may have based him off of his original RE1 appearance: http://statici.behindthevoiceactors.com/behindthevoiceactors/_img/chars/char_15802.jpg  Don't know why they would do that instead of using his REmake appearance.
residentevil,2wz26g,HobbieK,3,Tue Feb 24 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"It's worse than Revelations 1 so far, way more linear and unpolished."

residentevil,2wz26g,piexil,2,Wed Feb 25 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"The IGN review gave it a decent 7/10, mostly points off for lack of creativeness but good points for solid handling and combat.  I'm waiting on my physical copy so I won't be playing it until all the episodes are out."

residentevil,2wz26g,mrkeyboardwarrior,2,Tue Feb 24 14:53:36 2015 UTC,"The way you're describing character handling suggests to me that it was probably copied and pasted from RE6. If that's the case, you can tap the aim button to stop on a dime and realign yourself to wherever the camera is facing instead of having to clumsily turn around.  I don't actually know, though, because I don't get it until tomorrow."

residentevil,2wz26g,xveganrox,2,Tue Feb 24 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"I've only beat the Claire segment of Part 1, and played some raid mode.  So far, I like it less than RE:Revelations and more than RE:6. Its about on Par with RE5.  I hate that you are responsible for your AI partner again. That was the best thing about Revelations.  I like the atmosphere, but the new infected are not as cool as revelations' infected were, and the setting is less interesting. It feels like a rehash of RE:4 Part 3."
residentevil,2wz26g,HobbieK,1 point,Wed Feb 25 04:11:09 2015 UTC,"I would say I like it more than 5, but 5 was definitely better polished. This thing gets downright clunky at times. I'm not upset because I know it was produced on a budget and I'm just happy it's at least trying to bring back some of the atmosphere that made the games great, but I did get some generic survival horror feelings at times. If RE wasn't tied into the game, I don't think it would be considered anything other than average.   All that being said, I have a feeling this is the kind of game that will get better when all episodes can be taken into account. I also have yet to break open Raid mode."
residentevil,2wz26g,BadSeedling,2,Wed Feb 25 05:33:08 2015 UTC,"5 was better structured. The first few levels of 5 are really good before it starts going down hill.  Revelations, like you said, feels very generic survival horror. I didn't feel panic too often. More frustration as I died over and over again in that last room with the 30 enemies that you have to kill with the horribly controlled flamethrower."
residentevil,2wz26g,bobeo,2,Wed Feb 25 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"I loved Revelations 1, but seeing the list of DLC including extra storage for weapons and parts in raid mode makes me hesitant to buy this just on principle. That seems more like evil freemium marketing than RE."
residentevil,2wz26g,CT-1138,2,Wed Feb 25 13:36:02 2015 UTC,It is annoyingly laden with microtransactions in Raid mode.

residentevil,2x1ims,EQUASHNZRKUL,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:53:52 2015 UTC,"I would like to see them try remastering them on a new engine, since they have the time and the budget. Maybe Source or Unreal.   For those of you questioning my source suggestion, keep in mind that nearly any computer on the planet can run pretty much every source game, except for Titanfall, and even that is pretty runnable. This would solve the problem of people downvoting the game on steam because of the ""slow-motion bug"" that Capcom was ""too lazy to fix""."
residentevil,2x1ims,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"Do they have the time and the budget? Capcom was balancing on the line to bankruptcy until just recently, and are barely getting by now. Even Revelations 2 is clearly a budget game."
residentevil,2x1ims,EQUASHNZRKUL,1 point,Wed Feb 25 05:05:27 2015 UTC,I mean RE2 isn't that high on their priority list. They are working on RE0 right now so they do have time for RE2.
residentevil,2x1ims,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Feb 25 05:34:28 2015 UTC,"Completely remaking a game like that is very problematic in terms of design, and especially when the current Capcom has varying stages of little knowledge of what they're doing. A complete remake would also be equal to the production of a completely new game, so I don't think the only reason that they're not working on a remake of 2/3 is that they're doing something else."

residentevil,2wyvsv,KanjiBE,1 point,Tue Feb 24 09:19:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, up to a certain point but after that, they'll be ""no longer needed"" just like the keys."
residentevil,2wyvsv,chofortu,5,Tue Feb 24 09:54:38 2015 UTC,"The cranks always can be re-used. The keys literally have nowhere else to be used - no more doors to unlock, and you can't, like, lock the doors again"
residentevil,2wyvsv,jungleistmassive,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:41:19 2015 UTC,"Because the cranks are not like the keys, you can use the cranks over and over again. The game cant know when you wont need the cranks again."
residentevil,2wyvsv,KanjiBE,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:28:08 2015 UTC,Well the game can know whether all related doors are unlocked or not so it can also know whether the cranks should be used again or not. Technically...
residentevil,2wyvsv,jungleistmassive,4,Tue Feb 24 11:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they didn't design it that way, so there you go."
residentevil,2wyvsv,EQUASHNZRKUL,1 point,Tue Feb 24 11:48:12 2015 UTC,"Technically, its not the same.   Once you have unlocked the doors, the game can know for certain you dont need the key, as you never have to unlock a door twice.   When you use the cranks, there is no final unlock. The game cant possibly know you have no more use for the cranks, as you can use them as many times as you want."

Last I checked, and this is according to the current official Rev2 website, the game will release on the 24th on all platforms in North America. Perhaps Steam can't release the same piece of software at different times, so it will release there on the 25th? I'm not sure."
residentevil,2wwnhx,chofortu,2,Mon Feb 23 20:33:04 2015 UTC,"Last I checked, it will be on the 24th in America on PS4 only, 25th everywhere else and on everything else.   They made a deal for PS4 to get it first, but it failed and got confusing since EU will be a day behind, and Steam is global.  If it's changed again I haven't heard."
residentevil,2wwnhx,AppleChiaki,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:39:17 2015 UTC,Actually a deal to get it first on PS4  for one day. Sounds dumb to me.  I don't know  maybe its the same problem that happened with Grim Fandango. And they will fix it. And we will get it at midnight. But why so much exclusivity bullshit. i mean just let everyone get the game at the same time.
residentevil,2wwnhx,chofortu,3,Mon Feb 23 22:05:16 2015 UTC,I'm just glad it's only one day different. It used to be much worse! I remember needing to wait months for RE2 to come out in Europe after it was released in North America.
residentevil,2wwnhx,AppleChiaki,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:15:47 2015 UTC,"I believe it's going to be the same situation for each episode. One day seems a little silly really. Just enough to irk the customers, not enough to make any difference. I can't see who wins. Accept American PS4 owners."
residentevil,2wwnhx,AppleChiaki,0,Mon Feb 23 22:21:26 2015 UTC,I could have bought it on PS4 I did it for my friend who plays only on PC.  Still kind of  crappy having to wait one more day for each episodes.   At least we will have modding to change the ugly face of Claire XD

residentevil,2wxotd,MaggleDole,3,Tue Feb 24 00:54:08 2015 UTC,"They don't seem to have any real connections. Revelations 1 is a VERY self contained game, with almost zero connection to the rest of the RE universe beyond a quick nod to RE5 at the end of the game. To be honest, I really hate Rev1, it really isn't terribly scary and the plot is honestly one of the stupidest and most confusing stories the series has ever had, and that's counting RE6 and Gaiden. But I seem to be alone in that opinion, so don't take my word for it. But Im fairly certain Rev and Rev2 have no connection story-wise. You should be fine to jump right into Rev2."
residentevil,2wxotd,Sissle,1 point,Tue Feb 24 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the plot to RER1 was really weird. But seriously, who has ever played RE games for the plot? They have always ranged from B-movie to just plain odd. Just embrace the insanity."
residentevil,2wxotd,novembr,4,Tue Feb 24 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"I actually really like REs plot, and didn't know people thought it was so stupid until recently. I read S.D. Perry's books religiously as a teenager. One of my biggest gripes with the films is how they completely ignore the story and change characters personalities (Leon throws himself in front of a bullet for a woman he's only known for three hours in the game, claims a little girl ""isn't important"" and should be left to die a horrible, horrible death in Retribution)."
residentevil,2wxotd,Sissle,1 point,Tue Feb 24 02:43:17 2015 UTC,The only reason that the majority of the older fanbase is still aboard is the story.  I personally play all games I play primarily for the story.

I'd give Rev a 9/10, sadly Chapters 5 - 11 are pretty awful.  The game isn't scary though. & the story doesn't seem connected to Rev 2."

In the description it tells you all you get.  $24.99 version  However in this second link, ""Resident Evil Revelations 2"", the price changes to $39.99. It's $15 more, but includes everything for the game, including Hunk/Wesker.  $39.99 version  So to clarify, this content is already available for purchase, it just comes down to how much you're like to pay right now."

Keep it up fellow speedrunner."

residentevil,2wrotg,BarryBurton84,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:51:44 2015 UTC,They could probably do both and have a campaign selector at the beginning like RE 1 or RE 2 had. I think that would be pretty cool.

residentevil,2wt2b4,IhatePTC,4,Sun Feb 22 22:44:51 2015 UTC,I don't think the benefit of already having a Leon or a Jill model is quite as significant as you believe
residentevil,2wt2b4,chofortu,3,Sun Feb 22 22:47:12 2015 UTC,I agree entirely about 1. That is my biggest gripe with RE4. Is the amount of wasted story. The end of Umbrella was unnecessary. So much potential wasted in seconds. You could easily just have had Leon in an unrelated isolated scenario without doing away with so much.
residentevil,2wt2b4,The_Naked_Snake,1 point,Mon Feb 23 07:39:02 2015 UTC,"This, so much this.  I feel they should've taken Leon and Ada's story with Las Plagas in 4 and set it as an action-based spinoff series connected to the main series in character and references only. The game could be the exact same as the RE4 we know, just removing the ""all for Umbrella's sake"" line by Krauser. What we saw as RE5 could be Leon (instead of Chris) on a mission (with or without a partner), tracking down Las Plagas, finding Tricell, led by Excella as stand in for Wesker, but with no global saturation business. Maybe Jill's brainwashed story could instead be Ada, Wesker having done this to her as payback for double-crossing him? Obviously it wouldn't end with Leon nuking Wesker, as he would be there in communication only...  It would give the slower paced ""old"" Resident Evil games a chance to play out the way they were heading with Umbrella and viruses/Tyrants, and the action games with Las Plagas enemies.  The stories would reference each other (Leon and Chris obviously know each other in Code: Veronica) and Wesker could pop in and out of both stories here and there, being behind the scenes in the majority of them, playing for Umbrella in the Main series and Tricell in the Plagas series, but still staying true to the HCF that he's branded to in Code Veronica."
residentevil,2wt2b4,purpldevl,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:57:15 2015 UTC,"I do not consider 4 to be canon at all. It's almost entirely out of the Resident Evil universe. It has no similarity to the previous trilogy, other than having some of the characters. If Leon & Ada didn't exist in Resi 4, then it wouldn't even be a Resident Evil game really.  The story itself is really, really silly."

Billy and Carlos find themselves on a tropical island shortly after raccoon city where Billy has become a bartender and Carlos is hung up on Jill rejecting him.  They eventually meet and realize they were saved by the women of stars.  Later Nicholai Ginovief brings BOWs to the islands secret base where they get loose and billy and carlos have to fight them and carlos goes one on one with Nicholai.

residentevil,2wt2b4,AmethystWind,3,Wed Feb 25 07:49:33 2015 UTC,"The problem is that all of those 'stories' have concluded though. There's nothing to tell. The only way to bring those characters back into the series would be to make a completely new story for them, and in that case it could most likely be any character filling the part.  The best example I could come up with for an untold story would be Enrico and whatever happened to him during RE 0 and 1."
residentevil,2wt2b4,Zaeh,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:58:45 2015 UTC,That would be cool extra content to add to RE0.  Exploring what happened to the other stars members and seeing their struggle and death would give you a few extra hours of fun.

This will usually take out their head, saving lighter fuel. If not, it will at least 100% kill them in one shot, conserving ammo. Melee range is key for shotguns in RE1."
residentevil,2wswfe,Go_Away_Masturbating,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:53:30 2015 UTC,"You can try for their head at a safer range or from a higher elevation and have the same 60% chance I think it was to decapitate. Go for the knees instead. They'll always fall down and give you plenty enough time to run through. Sometimes, it even kills in one hit. I don't think fallen zombies can bite your ankles ever, either, save for the crawling one in the kitchen."
residentevil,2wswfe,LexCrunch,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:11:28 2015 UTC,How do you properly aim though? The game seems to only be 'straight ahead' 'up at the ceiling' 'down at your feet'. How close do they need to be to be able to hit them with head/leg shots? I feel like they need to be within biting distance
residentevil,2wswfe,LexCrunch,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:01:01 2015 UTC,The hit zones in Resident Evil are extremely forgiving. Experiment and find out.
residentevil,2wswfe,LexCrunch,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:38:05 2015 UTC,Its difficult to experiment when ammo is scarce

residentevil,2wswfe,Go_Away_Masturbating,2,Thu Feb 26 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"Are you shaking off the zombies when they're grabbing you? Mash some buttons (I think it's the directional buttons but it might be the other ones too, not sure what exactly I press lol. Pretty sure it's directional though) when they grab you and you can throw them off after one bite.  You said they're eating you so it makes me think you die if you get grabbed (which is what happens if you don't throw them off)  Ammo conservation is important (mostly toward the beginning of the game, later it doesn't matter as much) but it's OK to kill enemies. Just be wise about what you kill. The game has a lot of backtracking, so think about areas you might have to return to a lot. If there are zombies there, it might be in your best interest to kill them and burn the body (or decap). Less worry about having to dodge them and possibly taking a hit every time you have to return there. Make sure you retreat a bit after shooting off a few rounds so the zombies don't catch you.  If there's a zombie in your way that you don't think you should have to kill, and you can't dodge it, maybe use a defense item to get past it without taking a hit."
residentevil,2wswfe,bobeo,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:37:13 2015 UTC,How do you burn bodies? The game isn't very specific on any controls lol
residentevil,2wswfe,imagneto,4,Mon Feb 23 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"you will eventually find a canteen (for fuel) and a lighter (which Chris starts with).  Once you do, you can select use on the canteen when standing on a zombie body, and it will be burned.  ALso, try and stack the dead zombies on top of each other, and you can burn multiple at once."

I didn't know them, so I never actually said ""I want to speed run the stage"", but luckily they didn't seem interested in killing every enemy. They did want me to wait a lot, but I guess that was because their ammo slowly refilled?

residentevil,2wso2j,zynlen101,6,Sun Feb 22 20:58:09 2015 UTC,"Almost all of the Raccoon City survivors are in their late 30's or 40's. That's why they've been introducing younger leads in the newer games, like Sheva Alomar, Sherry Berkin, and Moira Burton. I don't see why Jill being 40 makes a difference."
residentevil,2wso2j,Polite_Werewolf,6,Sun Feb 22 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"According to the wiki, she was born in '74, so she's 24 when Mansion>Raccoon City goes down, 31 in Revelations, and 32 in Lost in Nightmares/RE5 flashbacks. She's 35 in main game RE5.  Jill being older makes a difference given that Resident Evil is developed by Capcom, a Japanese developer. Look at the rosters of Soul Calibur 4 and Soul Calibur 5. The older female characters are rotated out and/or replaced by younger female fighters.   It is, unfortunately, a cultural issue within Japan. Women are still primarily looked upon as having done something wrong if they aren't mothers/wives by age 30. Career women still get heaps of grief and overt sexism in their businesses. Younger girls are allowed to be individual and all the good stuff up to a point, then they'll face incredibly heavy pressure from society and even their families to find a husband, stop working, and have kids.  Jill's 35 in RE5, and both of the later-release titles featuring her (RE5 and Revelations) have amped up the subtext of her relationship with Chris. Her utter removal from RE6 might be retcon'd into her having become a mother/wife to Chris/Chris' kids in the years after 5.  At least in 5, they showed that she was still (very believably) able to kick a hell of a lot of arse while being 35, because she is constantly active and keeps her skills up, but she is being phased out for younger characters. It's unfortunately what will happen to all older women in Japanese media."
residentevil,2wso2j,AmethystWind,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:30:57 2015 UTC,"I can't believe they'd so something like this to Jill. RE almost exclusively depicts the women main characters as ass-kickers who dedicated their lives to stopping Umbrella/Tricell/etc. Turning her into a stay-at-home mom would be very uncharacteristic. I'd say it makes more sense to give her a command role in the BSAA, for example making her director of the North America Branch or something along that line. That would be a more honorable end to her character."

Remember Resident evil 0, 1,2,3,Code Veronica all happened on the same year which is 1998. Its about time for Capcom to make a new 1998. We dont need a reboot yet. There is more to explore.  Did you know Street Fighter II,III ,IV and V all happened in the 90's"

While I get there are still a few unanswered questions, they are mostly just useless with no real substance, or can be left completely up to interpretation (the fate of Rebecca for example). The series is in desperate need of a reboot. Even if they use the same characters, but completely modernise it, much like Casino Royal or Tomb Raider, it'd be far more preferable. It's the best way to get rid of the convoluted, bloated, nonsensical universe that is current, and put REAL meaning into the storylines with REAL characters and REAL development. Don't get me wrong, I love early resident evil games, but in terms of plot, and characters, it's very 90s gaming. As for recent resident evils, it's just not cutting it to a modern audience. It's trying with the big twists, the predictable plot, the screaming, action, Blargh, but it really has such a failure vibe too it."

Leon, Chris and Ada needs to have a vacation though.   My ideal resident evil 7 will be  Jill, New character who is a civilian and maybe Rebecca.   I wont mind Jill returning because she is at least gone for 2 games and she is only a minor character in 5.   I think the movement of the return of  Rebecca will rise after the remaster of zero. I think after Remake remaster, I am starting to see people requesting her because she is gone for so long.  Many People dont like Sheva, But Sheva returning have one positive, A return in Africa.  One of the biggest waste of resident evil 5 is not having infected African Safari animals.  I think 7 should have a Maximum of 4 playable characters with 3 campaigns. 2 characters have solo split campaigns while 2 will share a coop campaign."

The first Chapter is 1998 which will set In Raccoon city, This chapter will play like an old school resident evil and there will be type writer and Ink ribbons. It will be in places in Raccoon city that is never shown before.  On this chapter we will play as teenage Rebbeca Chambers.  Chapter 2 will be in 2004 at the Terragrigia Panic, On this chapter we will play as a 24 years old Rebecca Chambers.  After Raccoon city Rebecca didn't join BSAA, instead she decided to work as a doctor and try to live a normal life and maybe she tried to have a family. On this chapter Rebbeca's husband and kids will die.  Chapter 3 will be on the present day where Rebbeca is on her 40's and she is now a member of BSAA.

At certain point there are fans who said they dont want Barry to comeback because he is old but when he returned they were hyping as hell.  If Carlos, Sheva , Helena, and Parker are given a chance to return, I think it can be well received depends on timing and execution."
residentevil,2wr4co,cafe-disco,2,Sun Feb 22 22:50:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. These characters do need a second chance. I'm saying people didn't like them simply because they were new and unfamiliar. Sherry is a perfect example. She was well received in RE6. Not because she was written any better than the newcomers, but because people saw her and said, ""Hey! That's Sherry from RE2 all grown up!"" and bam, instant approval. She wasn't even major character in RE2. People just like what they're familiar with."

However, I don't see any minor characters returning as a main protagonist, so the only solution I see is building a new character and keeping him/her in later installations so they don't seem like a complete filler/throwaway character like Piers from RE6, or Sheva. We need a new Jill/Chris/Leon who will remain in the games to come. Also, I don't want to say bye to the big three, but it seems like we may have to by the end of the decade. It doesn't make sense for a 40 year old to still be as flexible as Jill or as ripped as Chris."

residentevil,2wq8bs,LexCrunch,3,Sun Feb 22 03:58:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the video, pretty cool! My brother has used this exploit in the past but it just takes the fun out of it, so I must agree with Ryndis, just don't use it. I really don't think it's reason enough to dislike the game."
residentevil,2wq8bs,Scottehhh,-6,Sun Feb 22 06:29:55 2015 UTC,"Like I told Ryndis, I just can't not use it. It's not a bad game, it just hasn't aged well and I don't like it. Even without pause canceling, the absurd amount of invincibility that every enemy gets when you hit them is off putting to me, so the combat isn't even as fun as it should be.  If I could get rid of pause canceling and make the enemies behave more like they do in 2 or 3, then RE1 would probably make my top 5 favorites in the series. As it is now, though, it's in the bottom 5. While I'm on wishful thinking, I'd love to be able to skip cutscenes in 1 and 2."
residentevil,2wq8bs,thedude2618,5,Sun Feb 22 07:09:38 2015 UTC,"the combat isn't even as fun as it should be.   Heh, the combat was never meant to be fun in RE1, it's a survival horror game."
residentevil,2wq8bs,wolfdwnyourfood,1 point,Sun Feb 22 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"Fun can be interpreted different ways. While it might not be fun in DMC terms, it could still be broken, this inhibiting any fun or value. I think he's wrong, but I also didn't play a lot of the original and stuck to the REmake"
residentevil,2wq8bs,thedude2618,0,Sun Feb 22 16:23:28 2015 UTC,"That's a very silly thing to say. Eternal Darkness and Silent Hill are both survival horror games, and the fighting in those games is great. What would even be the point of including the ability to fight at all if there was no intention of incorporating any fun whatsoever into it? I personally find the combat really fun in literally every other game in the series."
residentevil,2wq8bs,Ryndis,3,Sun Feb 22 17:35:42 2015 UTC,"I made this a really long time ago, so it kind of sucks, but some users here didn't seem to know what pause canceling was, so it seemed appropriate to post."
residentevil,2wq8bs,Ryndis,2,Sun Feb 22 04:00:10 2015 UTC,"It's a worthwhile watch, comparing the handgun and knife mechanics was interesting to me."
residentevil,2wq8bs,btbcorno,5,Sun Feb 22 13:20:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't know what that was. However, I don't see why it takes away the fun of the game when you are literally using an exploit. Just don't exploit. It's not like dodging in 3 where you can get so good at it the game becomes trivial, this is legitimately cheating. Toss a game shark onto any game and it isn't going to be fun."
residentevil,2woj98,sheriner,3,Sat Feb 21 19:14:29 2015 UTC,What about Umbrella/Darkside Chronicles? Aren't they slightly relevant?
residentevil,2woj98,eharsh87,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:25:21 2015 UTC,"Yup, and even with the titles presented at the moment, you could go into much greater detail on when they take place. But the list is already cramped as it is, so dunno."
residentevil,2woj98,Zaeh,2,Sat Feb 21 23:58:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's obviously just meant to be main titles only, but from what I've read the Chronicles at least shed light on some important things.  I don't mind at all not having the Gun Survivors or Outbreaks."
residentevil,2woj98,eharsh87,3,Sun Feb 22 00:03:34 2015 UTC,"Chronicles, Survivors and Outbreaks all expand and shed light on the events in the main games, but including them to the list would be... a nightmare."
residentevil,2woj98,Zaeh,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:05:06 2015 UTC,"Chronicles really don't count because they're mostly rehashes of the first couple games. Survivor 1 could fit in nicely between 3 and CV, while survivor 2 is just a arcade shooter using CV assets. The outbreaks can be listed by scenario rather than as full games. The only one I don't know where to place is Dead Aim."
residentevil,2woj98,ComradeGarcia_Pt2,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:09:45 2015 UTC,"The original scenarios in Chronicles are canon, so they 'count', if you prefer that term. Survivor 2 is canon in the context of it being Claire's nightmare, but that's about the only ambiguous one. Dead Aim takes place in 2002 if I'm not mistaken."

residentevil,2woj98,foxtrot_the_second,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"Only their original scenarios are.   And part of the issue is, that like the Survivors & Outbreaks, they're very closed side stories. They may shed light on details in the main franchise, but they're not particularly critical."
residentevil,2woj98,omeganemesis28,2,Sun Feb 22 06:46:40 2015 UTC,I have a hard time believing code veronica takes place the same year as RE:1 AND RE:2 in the span of one year Claire went looking for Chris AND Wesker dies and is brought back and somehow ends up on Rockford island as well?
residentevil,2woj98,xScubast3vex,2,Sun Feb 22 04:12:56 2015 UTC,"I thought that too. This came up in /r/games I think and we discussed how technically CV quite literally takes place right after RE2.  It makes sense because it still feels like Umbrella was sort of operational. Claire being caught and all. That had to have happened right after RE2/3 because after the fallout of Raccoon, the government handling it, courts, yadda - Umbrella had to be shutdown at some point. How could Claire be caught after being chased and shot at by a helicopter, hog tied, and thrown on Rockfort if Umbrella had been disbanded by the government? :P"
residentevil,2woj98,omeganemesis28,2,Sun Feb 22 06:52:16 2015 UTC,"CV takes place in December 1998, three months after BIO2. Umbrella USA was shut down in February 1999 due to the U.S. Government's business suspension order. Umbrella Europe and all other branches remained active until 2003, with Umbrella Japan being the last to disband in March 2004."

I doubt it will make you feel better, but here's my tale of dumbass-itude:  My first attempt at Ink is for Squids ended after about one hour and forty five minutes. I was in the room with the sliding walls/statue-pushing puzzle. After pushing the statue, I had run to the other side of the wall to push the switch and reverse the walls. However, it was at this moment that I forgot how to turn around. I wasted precious seconds pressing back+examine instead of back+run. I tried it at least twice before realizing my mistake. But by then it was too late...   I doubt it's just us. This achievement makes people dumber."
residentevil,2wnc1b,Ndgtr,1 point,Sat Feb 21 11:24:37 2015 UTC,"That sounds... Like really weirdly easy for such a ""challenge"" you don't even really need that much space, it'll just make handling ammo and other consumables kind of annoying. Save your money and just keep upgrading the starter pistol and shotgun and avoid enemies like the Regenerators and you'd be fine. The starter shotgun gets infinite firing range as its special upgrade, which will take a while but negates any real need for a sniper. All of the other weapons are more for just fitting your own playstyle. I almost never use anything but the shotgun and a pistol."

residentevil,2wnc1b,Sissle,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:14:39 2015 UTC,The starting pistol is beast in RE4.

If you run out of fish to grab, you have to leave the area and return to respawn them.  Functionally it's a knife only run with few or no items.  Edit: It comes out to 4 large bass and 8 small bass for a nearly full inventory. (2 slots free.)  Or 24 small bass (not possible I think), or 5 large and 5 small, or some other combinations."
