The point of an interview is to figure out ""Can we work with you? Are you easy to work with? Will you be a good fit for the group and for the corporation?  For yourself, be prepared to answer basic behavioral and technical questions:   (behavioral) describe a time when you failed at something. How did you handle it? How did you change? What do you like to do with your free time?  (Technical) what are the differences between PE and EV/EBITDA? How are yields and bond prices related? Depending on what you're going into, these will be job specific.     Company: You should be prepared with a couple meaningful questions about the company you're interviewing with.  You can ask specifics about the line of business you're going into or you can ask general questions about product lines or corporate organization (how the teams are organized and share resources like research or compliance etc etc). Spend time on the website and read up. If you really want to work there, you should try to get to know as much about the company as possible. If they made major news recently, you can ask about what the excitement around it was like."

Even then, it took many months of interviews, any of which could have failed you. So, I would argue that you haven't really disproved anyone's attitude.

I have always been interested in research, looked up possible ways to get into that based on where I am, and settled on the CFA program. My firm has a PM arm, and looking on LinkedIn I see plenty of people working as analysts there that had FA experience. The difference is they all got a CFA/MBA to make the jump. FA does give you a solid base of accounting, excel, security types etc so it isnt a total waste. It just isnt going to set you up for any FO roles."
FinancialCareers,3dyj63,YAYYYwork,0,Mon Jul 20 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"Huh. Everyone around here refers to us as MO. Must be a company-specific thing. BO to FO would obviously be harder, like you said.   Honestly, I'm looking for anything that can give me mountains of work. I  know it sounds weird, but if I had a monthly deliverable due every day, I would be perfectly satisfied.   As it stands though, I have about 6 very busy days a month (prepping for and preparing multiple funds with the same due date), about 6 busy days, with only one fund due, and around 8 days with nothing to do but maintenance (making sure nothing weird's going on, daily reports, etc.).  I'm young enough to have the ability and the desire to work myself half-dead, so I figure I might as well take advantage of that while I still can."
FinancialCareers,3dyj63,YAYYYwork,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:16 2015 UTC,"Not sure what specifically you do, but if it is fund accounting it is most definitely back office. Middle office tends to be more risk, compliance, trade support. Not sure how many admins you talk to (i have spoken to a lot of people at various companies) and everyone tries to call everything they do middle office so they can try and charge more. MO/BO is really besides the point, the work is menial and dull.  If you want a more challenging career (as do I) you either need to network your ass off and get lucky, or get a degree/certification to make you more competitive in the industry. Again, I will suggest you really look into an MBA/CFA. If you didnt get into research/IB out of school they aren't going to pick you up now. Those positions tend to lead to the FO roles you seem interested in.   Not saying it doesn't happen, but from what I have seen going from Fund accounting to a front office role is extremely rare without gaining addition experience/skills. You can apply to some jobs and see what happens, but I wouldn't bank on it."

I chose the CFA program as I am more interested in markets/research and would like to eventually work my way into an analyst role for a PM. The program is challenging for sure but it is fair. I just sat for L1 in June, and it is basically just a recap of everything from undergrad (Finance mathmatics/stats/econ/accounting/equities/fixed income/alternatives/derivatives/portfolio mgmt/corp fin). It is also self study which is a lot more convenient time wise than an MBA for me. If you want more info on the CFA program come check out /r/CFA and search around.

FinancialCareers,3dzsfu,xVictor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"sorry to sound harsh but you just came off as extremely dismissive of somebody who came in and was trying to shoot you straight.  Bottom line, an associates degree is not going to make you competitive in the finance field.    Now, you said you are dispensary manager.  I completely agree with you 100% that there is going to be a TON of money going into the marijuana industry over the next decade.  It's seriously going to be a gold rush.  And you can certainly capitalize on that.  However, just know that there are going to be people with bachelors and masters degrees trying to seize on those opportunities as well.    What is the subject that you struggle with?  If it's math, then maybe finance isn't the right answer.  If it's English, or history, then whatever.  I do really think you'd be best served trying to get your bachelors if at all possible, because it will just make you that much more competitive, even in the marijuana industry.    The thing is, I don't really think anyone knows exactly what the next big revolution in the marijuana industry is.  Maybe some form of electric payment that's still tied to cash but lets customers pay using another medium?  Who knows.  You could save up and open your own dispensary with some other investors since you already have experience running that, and you won't need a bachelors to run your own business.  But if you're trying to work for somebody else, an associates degree isn't going to give you a lot of running room in the finance world.  I'm sorry to set you straight that way, but its the reality.  Finance is an ultra competitive field and even those who go to top tier universities and get good grades can struggle to find open positions.  The job I sit in right now had over 200 applicants for it.   For one opening, that's an acceptance rate drastically lower than Harvard or Stanford.  I only have a bachelors degree, but I was competing against others who may have had an MBA.  An associates degree wouldn't even get looked at in my type of position, and like the original commenter said, at my company an associates degree likely gets you in the door as an executive assistant with little room for upward mobility.  I hope that is helpful to you.  I don't want you to think that people are trying to hate you on, but in this sub we get a lot of people coming in who are clearly under qualified and looking for positions that are outside their reach, and then are dismissive when people ground them in reality.   If you're intent on only getting your associates degree, then staying in the marijuana industry is probably your best bet for income generation since you're experienced there."

I have seen moves from credit risk to levfin. You can go into corporate banking (which can pay more, and credit exp is applicable). Another option is moving to something that you cover (i.e. an insurance company). You could also probably get into a senior position at a rating agency (Moodys, Fitch, S&P) or something. There are a fair amount of opportunities out there, but you probably won't get any pay bump. VP's in credit risk make a good chunk of change...why give that up? Frankly, you are likely to take a pay cut wherever you go (unless you transition to a trading desk or IBD)."

Three years ago I was an incoming freshman to SCU (I think we have to call it first-year now) hoping to major in Econ/finance. You're right that SCU is pretty non-target for finance. I started networking a year and a half ago to get my internship in Chicago this summer.   First, watching through Khan Academy videos on general Finance & Banking puts you a big step ahead of everyone else. A few videos in and you'll have FNCE 121 and 124 under your belt. Really.   So at this point, you would want to find out what part of finance interests you most. There are so many subsets of the industry: investing, consulting, private equity, hedge funds, trading, market making, corporate finance, accounting, entrepreneurship and venture capital, risk management--the list goes on. And there are more subsets of each of those.   Maybe pick a term and grab a good book. Going into freshman year, I read:   Alpha Masters (book on hedge fund managers stories regarding how they got there with some good trades and lessons)  Zero to sixty on hedge funds and private equity (book on structure of funds, purpose, and strategies) Hedge fund market wizards (more interviews) Why I left Goldman Sachs (good story about working in ibanking)   Those books exposed me to some of the different things you can specialize in the world of finance. Another thing I'm really glad I did was take a programming intro class. Check out OMIS 30 and CSCI 10, if you're interested. One of the best decisions I made.   Good luck in BUSN70!

FinancialCareers,3dot2g,MichaelLuciusJulian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:22:29 2015 UTC,You're off to a good start in that you know what you want to do but now you've gotta narrow that focus. What in finance interests you? Investment Banking? Equity Research? Asset Management? Private Wealth Management? I think reading and researching is a great start. Some things I'd recommend adding on after you've narrowed your industry path:  Reach out to alumni in the field or any professionals at all. Try to get a mentor. Sell yourself as an eager young business undergrad. A lot of people have been in your shoes so they should be willing to help.   Produce something tangible. You're not from a target school. So you need to develop something you can show professionals/recruiters that you know your stuff. Want to do IB? Show them a financial model you built. Want to do something in stocks? Create a stock report or write for a blog. Find ways to translate your financial knowledge into something you can physically prove. Best of luck!

Whether it's the business school, college, or engineering school (which I assume you are in this case), I've seen plenty of my peers intern at investment banks only to realize it's not as great as they imagined. As others have stated, investment banking is a cookie-cutter kind of business. The interns who I've talked with were disappointed with their experience, even when they were interning at BBs because they never felt mentally ""stimulated"" or ""challenged"". More and more the smartest kids at my school are working in high tech, straight into the buy-side (HF, PE, etc.), or elite boutique IBs like Centerview and Evercore. Unfortunately, investment banking has lost a lot of its glamor and to quote a friend of mine who quit the business, ""It's a 15 year old dream""."
FinancialCareers,3dk6ym,BananaCrazy3620,11,Fri Jul 17 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"quality of life, friend.  When you're in college your primary consideration is money because well, you're a poor college student.  After you've been working for a few years, you realize there's more to it.  If you work at google, you're still going to be making a really strong salary out of undergrad, and your quality of life will be drastically better.   The chances of you actually reaching management at an IB are slim because its more likely that you're going to burn out and move to corporate finance or something along those lines.  People who leave IB to go work at a hedge or PE are a small minority, most leave to pursue other things.    You think you're fine with the work load now, but after you've been working 90 hour weeks for 2 years, you're probably not going to feel the same way.  You're going to be 22-24, and fresh out of college.  Most of your friends won't be bankers and will be socializing frequently.  But you won't be there.  Because you're going to be in an office twiddling your thumbs waiting for your managers to review your work product.  They'll probably review it around 7pm, and then have hours of revisions for you to make.  You'll be there til midnight or 1am making all the changes so it can be ready first thing in the AM for your managers.  They'll get in and not look at it til 11am.  You'll see pictures of all your friends having a great time on facebook while you're sitting in the office NOT spending all of that money you're making cause you'll be working.   You're also presuming you can get a BB IB job.  Also, don't necessarily assume that your salary will level off at $250k at a tech firm.  First of all, $250K salary is not shabby by any stretch, I don't know if you're realizing how good that salary actually is.  Any career is going to be what you make of it.  You could get an idea working there and start your own company, or rise to a level above middle management, at which point you'll be making more than $250k.  Not to mention, the employee stock options you could get at a leading tech firm which would far supersede anything you'd get at a financial services firm.  I have a buddy who started working at Apple out of undergrad and has been putting in the max on his ESP since day one for almost ten years.  He's probably amongst the wealthiest of all of my friends from high school, including those who went into banking."
FinancialCareers,3dk6ym,RIP_KING,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:43:32 2015 UTC,Where are you getting your idea that ib-> corpfin is more popular than ib->pe/hf? My network in ib and wall street surveys would disagree. Buy side is definitely the biggest exit option.  If you wanted to say ib to megafund pe is not a likely exit then you would be right.
FinancialCareers,3dk6ym,rowsforthebros,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"that's fair.  I wasn't trying to imply that there's really only one path subsequent to ib, but, if you think about it logically... IB is an ultra competitive field.  You start out at a major bank most likely, who employs thousands of people.  Then you distill that down to smaller pe shops and hedge funds which have significantly smaller teams and are even more competitive to get hired at than the initial investment banks.  Continue that up the line to MD and you're left with even fewer people.  I've seen people from banking do a variety of things after banking, including pe and funds like you've suggested.  I've seen some go work corporate development.  I've seen others try to get into operations.  I've seen some go try and become a product manager at a tech firm.    Bottom line, there's no 1 path obviously.  And going into banking does provide your resume with a bunch of extra oompf that likely opens a lot of doors in a wide variety of career paths that you might not otherwise get if you had simply started out in corp finance, etc."
FinancialCareers,3dk6ym,RIP_KING,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed and insightful reply.  While I don't agree with all of it, I see the logic in everything you said and I'll do some thinking.  I don't know, I understand how important quality of life is, but there has to have been people who said in college I want to work as hard as I can and build wealth - and then actually done that. There are people in investment banking who are fine with hours,so why is everyone telling me I won't be?   I want to build wealth and move my family to lower upper class, and in pursuing that it seems like IB is one of the best ways to go. I don't want to live in the suburbs and have an A4, I want apartments in multiple cities and an R8."
FinancialCareers,3dk6ym,RIP_KING,4,Fri Jul 17 00:01:55 2015 UTC,"you can still build wealth in tech, I don't know why you think that you're going to be making potatoes in that career path.  If anything, I think your income would be MORE limited by going into banking than tech.  With tech, the possibilities are limitless.  In banking, you know what you're in for, what your promotion schedule would be like (provided you're a top performer), and what your potential salary may be based on what level you are at what firm.  In tech, you could launch a new product or website with a small team of people, and you could be bought out for billions.  Or you could take your own company public.  You're not doing that at a bank because you're going to always be working under somebody else.  If your goal is to come out of school and make the most money possible, then banking is probably the right path for you.  If you want to build immense wealth, then tech is probably a better choice because YOU will determine your success based on your own ideas and how hard you work at achieving them.  If you're going to school in nor cal currently, your career opportunities in the tech field will be immense.  If you're so determined to be hustling in the IB field, why does it feel like you'd be less determined to hustle in tech?    The other thing to consider is, how is the work that you're doing going to make you feel.  I came out of school doing consulting.  I made good money, sure.  But it was sort of empty work.  I'd work on a client project, and at the end of it, the client would do whatever they pleased and I wouldn't really see the fruits of any of my labor.  I now work in corp dev / deal analysis at a major entertainment company.  I have a vested interest in the TV shows and film product that we produce and distribute to do well and be liked by the people who watch it.  It is FAR more fulfilling to me than working in consulting because I can see a work product at the end of the day, and so can everyone across the world. This, coupled with the long hours is why I think a lot of people burn out of that banking life after a few years.  I'm not trying to suggest that you will also burn out, but the data suggests that you very possibly might."
FinancialCareers,3dk6ym,RIP_KING,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:17:44 2015 UTC,"I've seen your responses around this sub and I have to say they are damn good. This one included.  But you touched on a key point for me: the risk. When I say I want to move into the lower upper class I am choosing my words very carefully. I am not terribly risk averse. But knowing that as long as I perform (very) highly, network well, and manage not to burn out I can expect seven figures, that is pretty solid to me.   Thinking hard about the type of work I really want to do, though, it is seeming more apparent to me that is in tech. But we'll see.   Thanks for the advice."
FinancialCareers,3dk6ym,elitelimfish,2,Fri Jul 17 00:27:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I try and keep it real for people in here because there's a lot of misinformation going around and people who are still in college trying to dole out advice when they haven't worked a full time position yet.    The other thing I would caution is that, you could do ALL of those things you said: work hard, perform well, network well, and manage to not burn out and still wind up in middle management.  Temper your expectations for a 7-figure salary. I think its important to consider that a lot of what makes ultra-successful people that way is a bit of luck and being in the right place at the right time.  Sure, many of those people work their ass off to get where they are, but many of them also just happen to be in the right place at the right time.    I will just say: if you're going into banking just for the money, I'm going to put my smart money on you burning out.  You have to truly love the rush that comes along with deal making to really be in banking or something along those lines long term.  You have to live and breathe that shit.  Money has diminishing value over time as you start to make more of it.  Consider that if you live in CA, you're going to be in the top 1% of earners if you're making over $400k a year.  That's nowhere near a 7-figure salary and I'll tell you right now $400k is more than enough for you to live comfortably on and be in the upper echelon.  It might not be yacht money, but you'll be living more than comfortably.  Even more so if you get married to a spouse who also earns a full salary like you would.   EDIT: Sorry, I don't mean to be a dream crusher or anything.  I'm just trying to lay it out for you.  I definitely had the same feelings as you did when I was in undergrad, and I learned in the first few years after graduation that I was going to have to climb the ladder just like everyone else.  But in tech, you can skip that ladder if you create something for yourself.  Not the case in traditional finance where you have to put in the time to get the payout."

FinancialCareers,3di2qq,ShayWhoPlaysAllDay,9,Thu Jul 16 13:19:02 2015 UTC,"For Excel, focus on the basics first and nail those down (vlookups/index(match), pivot tables, nested if statements).   There aren't any Excel certifications that people will recognize across the board. However, I would try to weave in Excel and data analysis throughout your resume (ex: you used it for a certain course).  FP&A and general finance recruiting is a lot less structured than banking, and this can vary significantly from company to company. For example, some companies may have a structured program, they are hiring well in advance while other companies or may not, so you may just see a posting for an intern the month before summer at the regional office of that comany near your school. I suggest you leverage all resources, meaning your school career services, external job sites and your network. Make sure your LinkedIn is up to date.   Try to learn about databases, querying data, combining data from different sources. You have to be aware of what is ""in"" the numbers and what's not. Many times in FP&A, you're not just using pure financials (from the GL). For example, data source #1 doesn't include expenses for a portion Product Y, I need to adjust this in my model/forecast/powerpoint/deliverable. It's tough to get this experience in school and no one will expect you to know this in a first internship, but just have an idea of how Access works, and be familiar (of what they are, not that you need to be proficient) with things like Hyperion or Business Objects (there are lot more).  More importantly than databases, once you are at the interview stage, get familiar with the company and specifically the division that you're interviewing with. FP&A (usually) requires at least high level knowledge of your industry, competition and specific products. For example, explaining high level trends, you have to understand what customers are buying more and less of and why that is.   The finance/accounting thing is overblown in my opinion. I really don't think this affects people. The only time this comes into play is if you're interviewing with the accounting/controlling division of a company. At both companies I've been, these are all CPA holders that previously worked in Public Accounting (pretty much what you would expect an accounting org to look like).   Lastly, a word of caution, intern titles may not necessarily say FP&A, so I would cast a wider net to ""financial analyst intern"". However, with that said, be aware that it is an extremely broad title."

I assume I'm doing well in looking toward opportunities for next summer this far in advance?  Almost too well I think - I can't find anything.  However, I'm studying abroad in Singapore in the Spring so I won't be able to do much in person then, so I'm going to try to focus hard this fall and Dec/Jan.  Do you think I'll have any luck this far in advance?  Yeah - the databases, querying, and data objects you mentioned seem vague and difficult to nail down and study without a plan, but I'll try to focus on Access, Hyperion and BO.  Would you suggest anything else?  Any resources to learn about those?  That's good to hear about the degree aspect, thanks.  As for getting the interviews in the first place - in your opinion, how realistic is a F500 internship in my stage at the moment (no prior direct experience)?  In order to find things worth applying for my general plan is to go through companies and fields that interest me in the F500, and then look through further fields in my area.  As well as using my networks, career services and such as you mentioned.  Any other tips you might have?   Thank you!"

Interns get dinged for the most trivial reasons because there are so many qualified applicants and the skillset required is so general, I mean it's an internship. This means things like, check your resume for careless mistakes, don't have too much ""fluff"" on your resume , understand company culture, if you're being interviewed for a satellite office in Houston don't say you want to work in New York, google yourself, is the first result the Facebook event page of a kegger you went to?, dress appropriately for the interview and so on. In your case, I would also consider putting only expected graduation date on your resume so you don't give away the fact that you're spending 5 years at undergrad. Good luck."

I feel like keeping it out would reflect badly on me hiding it in the first place.  Or am I overthinking it?  Also this is random, but you reminded me.  Generally for a Finance internship position, would it be possible to pay for rent/food/living expenses and move for a job?  I'd be fine with that if I could afford it.

The most surprising thing is how little knowledge they have of basic analytical excel skills. Things as simple as vlookups, sumproduct, index, etc and how they should be used to navigate through large datasets.   Once you have those skills in place, work on getting familiar with databases and queries, connecting them to excel pivot tables/charts with slicers, and recording and editing macros (basic vba) are all ""intermediate"" skills that would set you away from the pack from most of the undergraduate candidates.  It's not just technical though. The majority of my FP&A group are financial liaisons to the rest of the business, we are the face of finance. Having the technical capabilities to develop models and insights is one thing, but showing you can effectively summarize and communicate them (PowerPoint is used extensively) is what really swings the hiring decisions!"

FinancialCareers,3dauz7,Edub24,4,Tue Jul 14 23:29:04 2015 UTC,this. I think everyone looking for advice on entry-level jobs in this sub seems to forget that every major company has internal finance teams that offer up entry-level positions.
FinancialCareers,3dauz7,RIP_KING,2,Wed Jul 15 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'd say he shouldn't waste his time on investment banking analyst positions. He's under qualified and from the sounds of it not interested in slaving for 80+ hours a week anyway, and rightly so. The rest I agree with, and I would say corporate financial analyst roles are his best bet.  To build on that, I would suggest OP looks at corporate finance analyst openings at both large national firms and local firms. Most companies in the fortune 500 have large corporate finance arms, and in particular some of the more capital intensive companies in industries like industrials, consumer retail, oil/gas/natty res, and the finance have larger finance teams. These companies are large and therefore usually hiring, although I don't know what the protocol for a new hire would be as many lateral/midyear hires tend to be to fill openings with professionals who have prior experience. It's still worth it to call some HR people at these firms, check their websites for listings, etc.  Then look at some of your local companies. These guys are far more likely to pick up a new analyst outside of the college recruiting process as they don't have any SOPs for recruiting and likely have far more irregular hiring needs. A position like this, while not glamorous, could be a stepping stone into a much better paying and better respected finance department position at one of those larger companies I was mentioning before."

FinancialCareers,3d98h3,ShayWhoPlaysAllDay,7,Tue Jul 14 14:20:16 2015 UTC,"should I be worried about getting a job with a decent starting salary ($50k+) upon graduation?   Yes, you should be worried. You absolutely need some sort of relevant experience, regardless of what realm you go into in finance (unless it's sales). While it doesn't need to be an internship, you need to be doing something. Get involved with investment groups. Go to CFA events. Network through LinkedIn and ask alumni to meet for coffee. I can guarantee the people you'll be competing against for jobs are doing these things, and you'll need to too in order to have a chance.   There are other career paths other than IB that are easier to get into, but that doesn't mean they're a cakewalk. Most of the other desirable jobs require a different skill set than IB. Corporate finance, while probably the easiest to get into, usually requires a history with the company (via internship) or a personal reference from someone in the department. Without either of those, it's very difficult to get a good corporate finance position at a reputable company. Then there's private business valuation. There aren't typically a lot of these jobs, but they do exist. These types of jobs require a more well-rounded valuation-based skill set than others (IB and Corporate Finance). Most of the other jobs will require valuation knowledge to be accumulated in one specific area and/or industry, while private business valuation encompasses nearly every major industry and valuation method. Grades typically matter less in this career path because the employers are looking for work ethic, ability, adaptability, and fit, more-so than an intellectual grunt.   Then you have your typical 'finance' jobs which the majority of your peers in finance will be going for: community banking, sales, personal wealth management, etc. I can't think of too many other jobs, non-Wall Street-based, that are very relevant in the financial world.   To sum it up, you need experience and to know what you want and why you want it. Without that, you don't really have a good chance to have a job upon graduation, unless you settle for a job in 'finance'."
FinancialCareers,3d98h3,Precocious_Kid,5,Tue Jul 14 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"$50k plus should be attainable. It'll probably come down to networking and interview skills at this point, though... Your GPA and extracurriculars are to some extent set.  So, work on career fairs, interviewing well, reaching out to people, etc. And land as prestigious an internship as possible, I'd say."
FinancialCareers,3d98h3,danzania,3,Tue Jul 14 20:49:41 2015 UTC,"Moreso than for other majors, finance careers kinda lie on a linear spectrum. On one end is financial planning or similar that isn't that hard to break into and is pretty lucrative.  On the other end is I-Banking which is extremely hard to break into but much more lucrative. If you're bright, diligent, and relatively social, you'll probably find something on that spectrum.    /r/financialcareers and other forums like wallstreetoasis focus on I-Banking and similar because it's at the top and generally what people are shooting for.  But the good thing about finance jobs is that no matter what you're doing, you're going to be making a lot more money than average Joe."
FinancialCareers,3d98h3,unsure_2015,3,Tue Jul 14 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"Granted we're not talking about IBD, but the caliber of school that you go to still does influence to a great degree how ""hard"" it will be for you to secure interviews and offers in the financial services industry.   If you are from a ""target"" school (ivies, ""almost ivies"" like Duke, Stanford, MIT, etc., and other good schools like UVa, Vanderbilt, Michigan, etc.) getting interviews and offers shouldn't be too difficult as recruiters from many different firms will come to you and all that you really need to do is have good grades, invest at least a bit of time networking - even if it's just going to info sessions and following up with thank you emails and extra questions - and prep for your interviews.  However, if you are not from a ""target"" school - even schools with name recognition but questionable academic pedigree like UGA, SUNY schools, Penn State, etc. - you will have your work cut out for you. You will really need to rely on your alumni network and personal connections, cold call/email a lot of recruiters and analysts at firms, especially if you want to work on the street, and meet networking contacts for coffee if possible. You will also need to have impeccable grades for your resume to even be considered (3.7+).  This advice holds especially for finance jobs in New York City, however the target/non-target designation may be less of an issue if you're applying to a local or regional job (ie. you're applying for a finance job in Dallas and you went to SMU). There are also plenty of other options if you don't want to shoot for IBD or S&T, like corporate banking, corporate finance for a Fortune 500 firm, acting in a CFO capacity for a startup, working as a financial adviser, or even retail banking."

You can definitely spin it pretty nicely on a resume if you're going to be working strictly on the endowment.

FinancialCareers,3dajwa,vendettapolitics,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:55:25 2015 UTC,"My Uni is just a private school in the NW. Not a great school, but decent. The engineering degree would be from Oregon State, a decently ranked engineering program. Very strong hiring potential coming out of that undergrad, especially at Boeing in Washington. But I would be doing construction so I would try and work for Skanska or a big construction company for 8 years. The experience would almost all be management type experience. So I was wondering by the time I was 32 if I could get a top 10 MBA or if they would disregard the construction industry."

That being said you're not impressing anyone with it, and that's what MBAs are looking for. Sure math skills are important but math in finance is really easy. except for quant traders.   recommendation: go to your best option, transfer"
FinancialCareers,3dajwa,vendettapolitics,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:16:35 2015 UTC,"Then I would have to study Mechanical Engineering and working for boeing does pay well. But I would design like a seat belt on the 747 jet lol that'd be my one job. In construction I can get into project management or a superintendent role where I oversee the construciton of 30+ story buildings. Sounds much more interesting, pay in this case would be the same as a mechanical boeing engineer but it would take a few years to catch up to the Boeing engineer.   The project management role in construction often requires the engineering degree, you have to know the technical aspects but you also make sure that you meet cost estimations, sub contractor coordinating and other tasks. I wouldn't have to go international, but it's a cyclical business, so it would be nice to work in an international position where I follow the construction around.  I would prefer to stay domestic. More specefically local. Eventually i think the Project Manager has decisions to make on what route, so I was curious if I would qualify for a top MBA program so I could take the next step.   Not going to lie, if i was a senior project manager for most of my late career I wouldn't complain. They get paid pretty well and it's an interesting job to me."

I'm not privy to UK firms, but in the US we have smaller but relatively worthwhile firms that are reputable and have specialties. These smaller firms also have slightly better work-life balance.  Examples are like Moelis & Co. and Greenhill here. And they have offices in London. Reach out to alumni/ae from your school at these smaller firms to start.

I think you're giving up a bit too easily with your concern over the application process. Most finance grad schemes will have 1 or 2 interviews and then an assessment day so you might just have to get used to that, even for back office roles. Most other non-finance jobs for multinational companies will have a similar structure. It's something you have to get used to in the modern job market.  Try reaching out to people from your university that are in the jobs that you want to get into, drop them a message on Linkedin and see what they have to say in terms of advice or anything they could do to help."

FinancialCareers,3d8b2u,GaryPopovich,2,Tue Jul 14 08:02:28 2015 UTC,"PE firms get an annual management fee for committed funds. Usually it's based on a percentage of the total fund size. So yes, junior PE guys get paid based on appraisals / reviews. But if you really think about it, junior M&A guys also get paid off reviews - as they're not the ones sourcing and driving deals. So theoretically it's not your fault if the deals you get put on in a certain year don't close.  Bonuses can be much higher on the buy-side in any given year depending on how the fund has performed. At most middle market shops. salary is somewhat comparable to that of an IB associate. In terms of lifestyle your hours are only mildly better (maybe mildly worse at mega funds). I'd estimate that on the junior levels in IB, bonuses typically range from 50% to 100% of your base salary, depending on how the firm is doing and how you are performing. As some context, I made $80K in bonus on $80K base last year, but I've had friends at other places that made $45K on $70K base."

It takes a lot more than just ""I am good at Excel and went to a good school"" to make a transition once you're out of college, but you didn't specify what you do so it's unclear.  As you probably know, IB, PE, HF are typically the most competitive jobs in finance. IB recruits the most, yet IB is very competitive; the others tend to recruit experienced hires. IB mostly recruit out of undergraduate, so you should keep networking. Reach out to alums and friends to introduce you to others.  You won't take any pay cut going to Wall street jobs. All three should pay a base between 65k and 85k. In total, expect 100k or more at most places for a 1st year analyst, but realize that you will also work much longer hours (60 to 100) and have little to no life outside of work.

FinancialCareers,3cuvd0,jobthrowaway69,11,Fri Jul 10 23:36:26 2015 UTC,"You may want to check with your internship coordinator, as I'm 99.9% certain your UBS internship will be with a financial advisor, not as one. You need to have at a minimum both your Series 7 & 66 to do anything sales-related (which you'd get if you became a full-time employee of theirs).  So assuming the UBS WM internship is the same as the one at every other big wirehouse (like the one I also did in my college days) my only advice is:   Take these 3-4 months to actively find out if this is a career you'd like to pursue. Not everyone is cut out for IB/PE, just like not everyone is cut out to be an FA. Obviously becoming an FA (i.e., getting hired into a multi-year ""advisor training"" program) is much easier than landing a job in IB/PE, but making a career out of it is a different story. If you find that the career may suit you (or, at the very least, you'd like to keep your options open if you don't get a better offer after college), then go out and drink with people in your office. It's amazing how many interns don't actively seek out some beers after work. It's a great way to meet people who can vouch for you in the future. Try to work something out with the FA you're interning with where you can shadow him for part the day. When I did this internship, I basically sat in my FA's office from 8-12, listened to him talk to clients (and to himself), and took a shit load of notes. Instead of telling my FA ""I can do other things besides print and copy"", I essentially told him ""I will listen to everything you say. I'm not gonna argue with you bc you have 30 years of experience and I'm 20 years old. You can say whatever you want, I'm just gonna write it down."" That notebook alone made the internship worthwhile (granted my FA was a rare breed, not all of them are that interesting). If you don't do the above, you'll be binding reports 5 hours a day like every other intern... and like most of them you'll end your internship thinking ""this is the most braindead work I've ever fucking done, any idiot can do this job"". You'll be doing yourself a disservice if you're not actually learning anything about the business, and you'll be bored as fuck all day long. Really, there's zero reason to do this internship if all you're gonna do is organize file cabinets, because.... Literally anybody can get an internship in WM. There will be no leveraging of this into a summer analyst position. Doesn't mean you shouldn't do it as there are plenty of ways to get an SA offer, but temper your expectations on how impressive it'll look on your resume.   .... this ran much longer than I expected."

FinancialCareers,3cvht7,mayavision,6,Sat Jul 11 02:59:44 2015 UTC,"One of my friends worked for WFG and quit after about a month and a half.  He actually brought me into one of the seminars (based under their whole thing about signing up agents) to an office based out of Brooklyn's Chinatown and it was seriously shady. Like you said, they're more focused on signing agents who have little to no knowledge of actual finance and are more concerned with becoming a quick ""rags to riches"" story. At my seminar, the speakers spent 80% of the time talking about how this and that Chinese mother who just emigrated to the US with 2 kids started with nothing just a few months ago and now she drives a BMW because of the company.  I'm not saying necessarily that WFG is DEFINITELY a scam, but like you said, a lot of people have said it's a pyramid scheme, and I feel like just that alone should set you off of it a bit. Working for a company that has a reputation for being possibly a pyramid scheme is almost just as bad as working for an actual scam. My experience with them, at least, was really sketchy. I'm also not completely sure about New York Life, as the branch I went to talked about how they were some dealer-broker or subsidiary of the Canadian TransAmerica, but never mentioned anything else.  IMO, you'd be better off applying a salary based job at a company that doesn't have a questionable business model. Besides, you also have to remember that in sales jobs like these, salary is typically set lower than most other fixed salaries so that most of the money you actually take home is out of commission, so going to a commission-based job also depends on your own sales ability."

FinancialCareers,3cuyxo,SirCowMan,5,Sat Jul 11 03:16:41 2015 UTC,"Hard (especially hard from a non-target). There are a lot of reasons that contribute to this but the main ones are:   Most startups have very small or no dedicated finance staff. They run very lean and most often one person handles most finance related duties as only part of their job. The priority is on growth and finance isn't always seen as a growth driver. Private companies also have lesser reporting demands. Few finance jobs means there is a lot of competition. Most funded startups will not have trouble getting qualified applicants for finance positions (at least in most major cities). Why hire a fresh grad you have to train when there is a good pool of experienced candidates? Startups, especially smaller ones, almost always hire experienced finance people. A fresh grad just doesn't have the finance experience and knowledge that most startups are looking for and few startups have time to train fresh grads that are not in direct revenue generating positions (product, engineering, marketing, etc.)."
FinancialCareers,3cuyxo,Judowned,2,Sat Jul 11 03:44:56 2015 UTC,"I can speak a bit from experience here. Finance teams at startups tend to be very small, with a lot of overlap between treasury and planning and nothing on the development side. The roles are a little more distinguishable as it grows, but they want guys with a lot of experience to start so they can work both angles. If it's a more established startup with more distinct teams within finance, then they almost always want someone with experience for treasury and, unless they're growing, will have the same requirements for planning. Their total finance staff can be pretty small, so entering is tough. Plus you have guys finishing stints at BB banks or top MBAs who want to get in on a startup, so that's additional competition.  But there are other ways in from your situation. You can look for other roles they may have (operations, business analysts, anything non-sales and quantitative in nature), and leverage that later on to move in financial planning when they do expand. Or pursue an MBA/MSF while working and shoot for treasury. Otherwise, go work at the biggest-name firm you can in a finance role and look at startups in a few years."

FinancialCareers,3cth1x,IBDDude,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:29:32 2015 UTC,I'm an intern right now and some of my fellow interns have expressed the same problem of too little work. The advice given by some others and HR is to check with your manager if it's cool to shadow other folks or ask around for other projects outside of your official boss' capacity. Definitely discuss with your manager first.
FinancialCareers,3cth1x,wingatewhite,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"Spend time networking, talk to other people in the area at the analyst level when you have the opportunity (even if they are in different teams or functions). At my prior company, there was a group of interns in a shared cube space nearby, one of them stopped by a few times, introduced himself and asked about my division. When another org was hiring, they asked me and I recommended that kid simply because he was the only intern I knew, and he got hired. In industry, where internship hiring is much less structured than banking, it can really be that simple.   If you're in a large company, I guarantee they have training courses. Spend some time learning about the business you are supporting. What are they selling? Watch some product training videos (they are usually for sales or product management). Open the customer facing website of your company, read the examples, case studies, etc. Then, when you're training with your boss or working on a task, you can indirectly inject useful information showing that you did a little bit of homework.   It's very simple, do your work and check your work."

Of course, be well versed with everything you've written on your CV, especially the points that the interviewer can relate to (e.g. Research and analysis, generating reports, etc). Read up on fixed income markets, understand what's going on in the world of credit and build a view on the market. Have an answer for ""What do you know about fixed income?"" and ""what's your view on the credit market now?"". Familiarise yourself with the basics of FI - yields vs price, relative valuation, credit spreads, munis vs treasuries vs corporates. You don't have direct experience but transferable experience, so learn what you can about FI so you can have a relevant conversation. Good luck!"

My best advice would be to speak to as many people as possible and get feedback from them. You will know what your weaknesses/strengths (i.e. grades, experience, poor CV, strong CV/poor interviews). Then you can plan your strategy."

FinancialCareers,3cfegx,rebizzle9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:47:29 2015 UTC,I'm not interested in becoming an FA personally. What other positions in other firms require this sort of licensing?
FinancialCareers,3cfegx,HobbesNYC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:54:28 2015 UTC,"Don't take it.  You will likely get fired for performance and the exit-ops are weak.      This, and many other financial adviser sales positions, are very similar. They work like this: Recruit as many as possible, fire 90% of class that doesn't bring in XXX dollars (after firing, keep what was brought in under threshold ), keep the few that produce really high amounts. Those that succeed typically have family wealth that will commit to transferring.     In effect, the advisory firm is just paying you a salary and commission as a bribe to get to your friends high net worth portfolios.  It's an effective model honestly.     When you do (almost inevitably) get fired.  You are in a huge pool of other FA burnouts. Not exactly a desired candidate for say, I Banking.  Don't overlook that the market is moving away from financial advisors, especially local advisors, this makes it much harder than 20 years ago.     If you like financial advisory, look into structured products or operations at a top firm.  That's a much safer start and you can steadily transfer into the selling if that is your passion.       Source: Worked at a MBB HQ in Asset Management, had many friends get duped into the advisory role."

Hobbes is correct in stating the exit ops are limited; however, the job security is relatively good. What's described above is a more accurate description of the Northwestern Mutual Financial Adviser Program.  The CA is not expected to bring on new business, doesn't have specific hurdles/quotas and has a limited role on the ""sales"" side. The job consists of binding performance documents (for the FA to review with his clients), scheduling meetings for the FA and answering low-level questions for concerned clients (e.g. stock splits, bank account transfer issues etc)."

If it does and your GPA has a discrepancy, the company will be provided that information on the report the background check firm produces.

That allows them to either generate new ideas or determine the impact to their covered companies very quickly when things change in the market.  If you're not the type to follow this stuff on your own then that doesn't really bode well for your success in the job.  I'm in equity research and even when I leave the office and go home at night I constnatly find myself doing random research just for curiosity's sake - potential implications of a deal in greece, the impact of el nino on commodity crop prices, etc etc etc - i'd do that type of reading even if i wasn't working research at a fund.  that's not to say you'll suck at the job if you get it - it's just that this is the type of person they look for, and if that's not you it will probably shine through in an interview."

FinancialCareers,3c1654,IBDDude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I didn't mean to start at them right away. I understand you begin as an analyst and work your way up to those jobs.  My doubts come as a first impression of what the job would be in the future, so to don't start working in something that later would not motivate me."

FinancialCareers,3c1654,brown_alpha,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:41:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what a portfolio manager is. You don't just become a portfolio manager. You have to have a long, proven track record that shows your skills and ability. You have neither the skills or the track record that will convince me to let you invest my money. The majority of portfolio managers have years and years of relevant experience. Before you ask questions like this, maybe you should do some more research."
FinancialCareers,3c1654,redrummm,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:06:19 2015 UTC,"I have read a lot about this and I keep finding mixed opinions.  For example, the debate in which the performance of active vs passive managed funds: http://online.barrons.com/articles/solving-the-active-vs-passive-investing-debate-1422304950  And people mostly seem to believe it is pure luck to consistently beat the market (I relate this to beat the benchmark of a portfolio): http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2012/03/12/why-smart-people-fail-to-beat-the-market/  So it seems to me that portfolio managers that have a better record are actually just lucky about it? Of course there is a ton of work that they must learn and know how to do, but in the end the top ones are just lucky?"
FinancialCareers,3c1654,NESCAC,2,Sat Jul 4 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"Most portfolio managers don't strive do beat the market, they strive for absolute yield. No one will be mad if your fund gets a 9% yield if Mr. Market gets 11% but they will wank your cock off if you only drop to 0% when the rest of the market drops to -5%. Making vol as low as possible is often very desirable for clients with high assets.  A lot of journalists don't understand this though."

FinancialCareers,3bxxsl,hr1234,7,Fri Jul 3 02:18:21 2015 UTC,"Your approach is very direct. You're asking them for a lot. They have not even met you so they will not be willing to put their name on the line to hire you.  Also, your approach is also very apologetic for some reason. Cut the apologies and extra excuses ""had to take a break"".  Google ""wso networking"" and ""mergers and inquisitions networking"" and follow their guides. I would give you advice here but they cover it off really well.  To super summarize, your objective of networking is to setup a 15-30 minute conversation with them. At no point do you directly ask for a job. You want advice, and highlight your interest.  Don't worry - I sucked at networking too when I started. It takes time and practice but you will get there. Don't let a few hundred rejections put you down - it's part of the process. Good luck!"

I wonder if I am taking too much of a long shot by going after these jobs. Do you think I still have a chance with that(based on what you see in my resume)?  Do you think a better strategy would be to seek positions where there is more demand (FP&A). What steps I can take to be more compatible for such roles?

Without getting too in-depth...get to the office at 9AM, check e-mail, read up on current events. Right now I'm sourcing deals so I've been doing a lot of market research.

I just graduated in April with a degree in finance and I already had a job lined up in March as an analyst for a commercial real estate finance company. I don't start for another couple of months but it's a smaller company (in terms of personnel) and all the analysts and brokers are younger guys between 25 - 35.  The plan right now is to eventually make my way up to becoming a broker."

Plus any dirty work for the brokers which can be things like phoning or emailing back and forth with clients, and some paper work.  From my experience in job hunting, this type of field (financing) or being an analyst for a real estate investment trust are probably the only few in real estate that look for finance majors. Most places are fine with marketing, management or business in general. In fact, when I was interviewing with this company they didn't ask me any technical questions nor did they have a lot of interest in my GPA. I'd say me getting the job was based mostly on my personality which makes sense because you need a certain personality to be good at sales. (however, they did require a finance major, and a few past internships)"

FinancialCareers,3bwwq3,spiral_static,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I just graduated. I've had a few summer internships but this will be my first full-time permanent job. The way this company works is that you start as an analyst and they essentially train you to be a broker so in a few years you become a full commissioned broker. But until then you're on a salary or salary-commission combo which is a nice way to ease into it.   Right now my plan is to stay with the company long term and become a broker. The commission these guys are pulling in can be crazy huge so it can definitely be a lucrative career."

Chances are, the firm you try to transiton to are going to like they you already have a lot of experience in the financial arena, although not necessarily in their expertise.   Also, the other comment is correct. A desigination would help. And it sounds like CFA is the one for you."
FinancialCareers,3bqt25,aveaou,3,Wed Jul 1 12:05:44 2015 UTC,"What I read here is: I am economically disadvantaged and willing to work hard (tick, tick), I will add to a programs diversity (tick), but I'm not as good as my peer group (cross, and your major issue).  Not having a high GPA will limit your opportunities for both IB/PE and MBA unless you can distinguish yourself in other ways. Getting the CFA is a great way to do that for IB/PE and I'd advise it, though it's tough and will cost say $3,000 to do (ballpark). Doing the CFA may mean you don't need to do an MBA to get into IB/PE.   For an MBA the standard entry method is to 1. do well in GMAT, 2. be relatively employable pre MBA (ie work for large corporate or be a consultant etc), 3. be distinctive (and if you are economically distinctive then this can get you a scolarship), 4. have the money  You can get 1 and it sounds like you have 3, though you can work on this through doing creative or interesting things like trading in your own time or setting up a business. Working for a big 4 accountancy would give you 2. If you have 4, that can work for you."

FinancialCareers,3bqt25,investor1001,3,Wed Jul 1 16:36:52 2015 UTC,Howso? The only applicable sections to PE are valuation and alternative investments.  And valuation is the only one of those that has even a decent amount of material dedicated towards it.  I don't think CFA suits PE much at all..
FinancialCareers,3bqt25,chingwang,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"I think the point was to stand apart from the crowd, not necessarily learn only knowledge that would be directly relevant to PE.

MBA courses want to rank well, and one way to do that is by turning people around (ie getting less highly qualified students to do well). Your non-target uni experience can play into that story.  But realise the actuality. You need the MBA admissions to believe that you can reach top firms after leaving their school, as post MBA salary is probably the key determinant in MBA rankings. To show this you need to have a good job and to have achieved well in it."

At this point based on what you've told already, you're probably going to be shit out of luck.  I think its important to consider that banking and consulting are extremely elite fields to get into, and only the best of the best (or most well connected) are generally accepted into the fold.  It's a harsh reality for 95% of the people posting in this sub, but its one you're going to have to deal with.  You're 26 years old though, you're not in a ""sad never ending reality"".  Pick your head up.  There are plenty of people who pursue masters degrees with minimal experience.  But just don't slack off this time.  If you slacked off in undergrad, there's a reason why you're not where you want to be today.

I think the MS Finance is very limiting and technical.  An MBA will allow you to pursue other things if you prefer them.  You might think you like finance now, but as you go through the program maybe you prefer operations or marketing.  The MBA program will afford you the ability to pick from a few different business functions rather than just hone in on one."

Are you really interested in finance or do you just like the ""idea of finance""? You're not too old for finance, but you're too old to go the 2 year IB analyst path to figure stuff out and then go a different direction.   Get and MBA/Mfin and then you go into what you want to do for life.  MBA is broader but M.Fin is more wanted at some places like hedgefunds. Want to work derivative focused hf? Go M.fin. If you go MBA->IB you'll start as associate.  Remember there are more jobs than Goldman and Blackrock. There are boutique BB's, small hf's, corporate jobs and other types of funds.

How does it work then? It seems unreasonable for a business to have a sole path to employment as opposed to what may be best for the company.

They have professional certifications (CPAs and CMAs ) and it didn't seem to help, they don't even use them. I haven't even finished my undergrad and I'm working on the same projects as them (and I'm no genius)! I don't think this is what I want to do.   I don't think anyone I'm surrounded by pictured themselves in the roles their in, and I might conclude in most cases that's due to poor planning. So I'm trying to put a plan together to get me to the lifestyle I want to enjoy. What I do for 8-10 hours a day is less important to me than how easily I can afford to pay the mortgage and replace 4 tires when the time comes without blinking or thinking twice....

I came out of college with a consulting gig and made a lot more money than most all of my friends right out of undergrad.  I hated it.  I worked there for 4 years before I found my next job, and the last 2 of those years were absolutely miserable and I hated going into work every single morning.  I ended up moving to the industry-side and took a lot less money to go do that and its been far more fulfilling.  Took me a few years to get my salary to where I wanted it, but I learned from that first job that if you're unhappy doing what you're doing, the money is no longer your primary concern.  Almost everyone I know who went into investment banking quit after 3 years or less and took jobs that paid almost half of what they were making in IB.  And they'll tell you now that they're much happier for it, though they may complain about the low pay occasionally.    If you have a particular lifestyle you want to enjoy, figure out if going to law school is really what you want because having to service law school debt is going to make achieving your lifestyle even more difficult."

So I guess the conclusion is that I need to reevaluate a lot of things.   I also have accessed where my connections lie and have had some informational interviews with those industry porfessionals. Most of my connections are in commercial banking. The concensus is I would start at 40k as a credit analyst, and in 7 years I could hold a relationship manager role in a perfect world with a base salary of 120k.

FinancialCareers,3bnwr8,fratticus_maximus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:21:21 2015 UTC,"What do you actually want to do? CFA, CPA, and law degrees are each great for certain positions and of very little help for others. They all have big commitments involved of time and money so you really need to make sure that your efforts will pay off before moving forward."
FinancialCareers,3bnwr8,fratticus_maximus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:10:04 2015 UTC,"You can definitely sit in for the CFA level 1 now but even after you finish level 3 (not an easy feat. Just look at the pass rates of level 1, 2, 3, which are, respectively, 36%, 32%, and 64%), you have to demonstrate that you have worked 4 years in financial analysis or something related. If you go to law school , you're looking at minimum 7 years before you can received your CFA certification. In that time, you can get through medical school and residency, and will be fairly guaranteed a 6 figure job as a physician (I'm not saying you should. I'm just telling you the timescale of things). As for CPA, most states (like 45+) require you to have 150 hrs before you can sit for the CPA exams or are trending towards it. You must be in one of those states with an exception. Still, if you don't get it immediately, there's a good chance that a few years down the line, the state will curtain that road. You're also thinking of going to law school. You don't have to read very far anywhere to know that there's an overabundance of law graduates that can't find work or become underemployed. The 6 figures that you will most likely drop will probably not guarantee you a 6 figure job unless you get into a top 50 (even then, it's not a guaranteed ticket to success). Also, it's not like law school is a cake walk. You will have no time to do other things like study for CFA or CPA. The amount of reading you have to do in law school is utterly insane. Don't try to grasp for everything. You WILL spread yourself too thin and burn out. If you burn out, there's a chance you won't achieve any of the CFA, CPA, or JD designations that you so eagerly want. You honestly need to narrow down your options. When you're first starting out, it seems like the sky is the limit. I'm not saying it isn't but there are very clear time, energy, and money restraints that we have to deal with as humans. Best of luck either way."

At my internship I'm surrounded by people with grad degrees and professional certifications (CPAs and CMAs) and only two people on my floor make more than $100,000 and it took them twenty or more years to earn that. I see that there are some accounting positions in other departments that start at around $80,000 with a requirement of 5 years of experience and a CPA. That isn't too bad of an income in my opinion. But the work isn't exactly excillerating... I'm in corp. finance right now, and it doesn't deserve to be called finance. It's literally all cost accounting and excel. I'll be doing this exact same thing for the next 12 years until I would qualify for a manager role. The first two weeks are for variance reporting (yay) the budget is ALWAYS wrong. The second two weeks are devoted to ad hoc expense analysis requests and budget adjustments (so it can be wrong again). There has got to be more to life...."

FinancialCareers,3blqat,CAK6,2,Tue Jun 30 15:00:49 2015 UTC,"Generally the best path into a (non-quant) hedge fund is through investment banking, ideally at a bulge bracket and in something like M&A, LevFin, or ER. Most people do 2-3 years as an analyst at a bank before moving to something on the buy side, corp dev, or whatnot. And most people land these banking jobs straight out of college through OCR at target schools. First of all, what you major in isn't really all that important as the name of school. In fact, most Ivy League and other top schools (e.g. Stanford, Chicago, Duke, Northwestern, etc.) don't even offer undergraduate business programs. And second of all, transferring into one of these schools is REALLY fucking competitive, several magnitudes more so than getting into them straight out of high school. Even if you pull a 4.0 GPA and alot of other extracurricular crap at your local college, your odds of transferring in are still heavily stacked against you since there are only so many spots due to low student turnover and so many people wanting to transfer in. Getting a MBA straight out of undergrad is pointless since 1. your odds of getting into any decent MBA program is pretty much 0 without work experience and 2. it'll fuck up your career progression since you'd be overqualified with your MBA for entry level positions and under-qualified for more senior roles since you don't even prior work experience.

Because You are aware of their reputation and if you weren't an employee of the company you wouldn't consider taking the mba courses in the first place.   If you would be hesitant to purchase their services as a customer, how in good conscience can you join their team help them sell the product when you don't truly believe in it?

There is something to be said about getting the boost in title; But a title is meaningless (compared to your actual compensation) unless you're using it to negotiate your value against future employers. This would require you to enter into this position with a specific exit plan in order to harvest that value in a timely manner; not to mention that everything would have to go exactly according to plan for it to work out for you a few years down the road. the 2nd problem with that is that you'll be coming into a new job and you'll already have one foot out the door, which doesn't help for motivation at work and in what you do.

Be careful stepping down to a FA2 even if it's for more money. It will take longer to advance back to SFA, and, think later on, you'll have to explain why you essentially demoted yourself.   In most cases, an MBA from DeVry or Kaplan is not worth it, even if it's free. I would completely discount this fact from your decision making process.   You've got two offers, assuming you're already employed as a full-time (non-contract, non-temp) SFA at a medium to large sized company, I bet you can secure a much better position, lateral SFA to another company or even move to a Finance Manager position.

First of all, WSO is a hack website populated almost entirely by college undergrads obsessed with banking but whom know little about it. Their visitors are by no means a representative sample. Add the fact that it is self reported and you've got even more noise in the data to the point where the bias makes it totally unusable.  Secondly, that data is looking at undergrads and grad schools, at least. Because Princeton is in there and Princeton does not have an MBA program. Due to the juvenile user base of the site, even all of the bias aside, I suspect that most of these responses are from undergraduates and not MBA students. So its not even relevant to this guy being that he is an MBA student.  Their ranking methodology is also totally illogical and bases rankings off of what percentage of applicants from a given school get interviews at a bank. That statistic is in no way a representation of the strength of a given school. Considering that this is an undergrad population in the sample and not a graduate population, the applicant yield is incredibly manipulable and subject to bias amongst a given school's students. Banks predetermine how many interviews slots they have and how many interviews they give out. The interview yield may be higher or lower depending on the number of applicants, which is entirely relative based on the appeal of finance at a given school and the size of the undergrad population. And, that ranking makes no commentary on how many of those applicants even get internship offers, let alone full time offers. And it has no detail on the divisions/positions applicants are even applying to.  TL;DR: WSO school rank is a load 'a hooey. Mostly undergrads so its not even applicable to OP's MBA question. Biased sample based off of WSO's users and self-reporting make the findings biased and useless.

FinancialCareers,3b4g43,mzackler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:07:07 2015 UTC,"Assumption on my part on the grounds that he refers to the Kelly School of Business. Just made me immediately think MBA because he referred to the b-school and not the undergraduate institution although on further examination he alludes to a #8 ranking in bloomberg in the comments which is their undergraduate ranking.  Alternative ranking? Just general street knowledge. I won't get into specific numerical rankings but that list is seriously flawed. I would say there are groupings of universal targets (Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Penn, Columbia), targets (Cornell, NYU, UVA, Georgetown, Northwestern, Duke, Stanford, Michigan), semi-targets (Notre Dame, Brown, UChicago, Dartmouth, BYU, liberal arts colleges), regionals (Indiana, nova, USC, UCLA, Cal, Vanderbilt, a few Texas schools) then other.  I would say Indiana is a stretch to get into that semi-target group. But they do well. Have a solid alumni contingent on wall street which I venture is at least an artifact of their school being so large. Never going to just waltz into a job but you'll have a decent chance and a strong alumni network to tap into."
FinancialCareers,3b4g43,gadela08,3,Fri Jun 26 07:50:38 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Indiana just refers to Kelley (two es) for both undergrad and graduate students just as Penn students do for Wharton.  Honestly didn't really look through it much before posting but I definitely think there are flaws with your list too. Not including MIT at all? Putting Columbia before Cornell, higher for Cal etc. Of course I don't have real statistics on this.   The rankings thing is kind of pointless from my perspective unless he was deciding between two schools. If just looking at Kelley and wants to know how you stand you can correct my opinion but I hear their investment banking seminar/network/workshop? places reasonably well and outside of it it is basically impossible without good connections. It looks like the program does well from a cursory glance. Definitely some Chicago in there but some people want that.  For fun though I recommend the Hunzicker resume."
FinancialCareers,3b4g43,burnshimself,2,Fri Jun 26 08:48:34 2015 UTC,That dance marathon position sounds like a real door opener!
FinancialCareers,3b4g43,burnshimself,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:32:49 2015 UTC,"I only don't include MIT because MIT guys are rarely interested in investment banking out of undergrad. If they do finance related stuff, they usually end up in S&T or quant roles. They could be very competitive no problem from an academic perspective, but few are interested in doing so and therefore a lot of banks don't go there. Hence, they're not a target. Same goes for Caltech, for instance. Sloan MBA may be a different story, but for undergrad thats the way it works.  I also noticed MIT wasn't even on your WSO list at all, so if anything your ranking is more at fault by your own estimation for placing them outside of the top 50 and putting them below schools like Rutgers.  And yes, Columbia is definitely higher than Cornell. Being in NYC makes the school far more accessible for banks. A recruiter would be hard pressed to come up with a reason why the bank couldn't go 5 miles uptown from FiDi to visit Columbia and try to recruit some ivy league caliber kids sitting right on their doorstep. Cornell is all the way out in Ithaca, really far from NYC, poorly accessible by public transit, and a generally unappealing destination for recruiters. Not to mention that when you compare the sizes of the two schools and the number of students trying to go into finance at each school, Columbia is placing much better than Cornell. Cornell has a ton of students and therefore a ton of applicants seeking out IB positions, but only a fraction of those kids succeed in that capacity. Columbia has far fewer students looking to work in finance yet still manages to place a large number of students each year. It is splitting hairs to an extent, but Cornell's location kills them.  Cal does well on the west coast. Still haven't found more than a couple cal guy at any east coast IB office. Hence, regional. And your ranking methodology has Cal at 24, below schools like the University of Florida. I think that error is far more egregious.  The eye test/general perception is typically more reliable than any sort of scientific ranking someone could come up with. Everyone knows who the big targets are, all you have to do is look around at where the analysts in any given bank's IB group came from."
FinancialCareers,3b4g43,maracay1999,2,Fri Jun 26 17:16:46 2015 UTC,"A vast majority of target schools have no undergraduate business school, which makes that ranking misleading. All ivy league schools outside Penn and Cornell, for example, lack separate undergrad business schools. Northwestern, Stanford, MIT, and UChicago are other target/semi-target type schools lacking separate undergrad business schools.  To put you at ease I would characterize Indiana as a semi target. You have a strong wall street alumni network thanks in part to Indiana graduating a lot of students. But banks are not going to be just handing out jobs to a half dozen students at a time; you're going to need to work to distinguish yourself from your peers in a very large institution and network your way to the top of the application pile."
FinancialCareers,3b4g43,mjvcaj,3,Fri Jun 26 07:56:39 2015 UTC,I believe a few dozen get into I-banking every graduating class. Investment Banking Workshop is usually ~15 and has a good network for the industry.   A lot of the big name / bulge bracket banks recruit at Kelley through at least having on-campus interviews or career fair appearances.   Disclaimer: I went to Kelly but am not in I-banking nor do I have frame of reference for how prominent the industry is at 'better' schools.

All these students showed promise and excellence on paper as leaders in school organizations and the right kind of internships which showed the student's commitment to this career path. I agree 100% that Cookie cutter is not the best way to hire college grads - candidates who are the right fit will show their true colors during interviews if you ask the right questions- but having graduated from a competitive undergrad program, and having fought to stand out against my own peers for a decent job out of college, and having some experience on the hiring side, I know that there is a surplus of fantastic candidates from these schools.  if I've never heard of your school  (whatsoever) and you're interested in a banking job - you've got to realize it looks as if the applicant hasn't done everything he should have to set him on a path which would make it easier to get into banking. If you messed up as a high schooler, that's OK, but I need to see evidence of improvement and drive towards excellence. If your family is poor, and you had to go to community college for a few years, but you still kick-ass, then your success and preparation will show in your numbers.

FinancialCareers,3b1deb,gooby_pls2,27,Thu Jun 25 04:31:58 2015 UTC,"Shit, everyone hates it! Just kidding.   I'm not an IB, I work as a management consultant which has its parallels but is, of course, a different arena. 30% of my time is spent on M&A work (commercial due diligence, CDD), which is very similar to IB but less quant (excel) focused.  To enjoy CDD/IB you need to   Firstly want high pay (tick for most people), this industry pays well and you'll automatically be in the top 5% of earners. In the UK this is about £50k starting plus £30k bonus for bulge bracket (c.$120k pa in the US). Note that the financial crisis hasn't really effected bankers salaries in IB, regulation may put a cap on the top, but at the bottom it's still as it was pre financial crisis.  Second you need to not care about your social life as you will be expected to work any hour required. This means starting at 8am and working till 11pm on a normal day, and 2-3am on a bad day. You will also have to have weekends at the mercy of your job, and be willing to cancel holiday even if it's 2 days away and has cost £3k (the firm will reimburse for this). IB is changing slightly (GS won't let interns work between Midnight and 7am on weekdays now, though note this says nothing about more senior staff or weekends). The social sacrifice is a big question mark for most people and makes it very difficult to actually spend the money that you earn, apart from on your birthday blow out and the apartment that you spend little to no time in.  Third, you need to be happy to do all of the boring, hard, tedious work at junior level. You will not be making deals, or meeting clients, or providing much advice until you reach MD level (4 promotions and 10 years away for entry level grads). Your work provides facts for the intriguing analysis but does not normally have much gravitas. You are essentially data crunching, in IB you are literally building DCF models and LBO's (or part of them) and passing them on to your manager, who will tell you that it needs to be redone within the next 2 hours because ""you've fucked up and are taking the piss you good for nothing piece of shit"".  Fourth, you'll need to be happy to be treated like shit by your seniors. The quote above is not a joke, my mates in IB had far worse chucked at them and in CDD I've been ""bitched"" told that I won't make anything of myself if I put in work like that etc. The theory goes that if your boss went through it you have to go through it and a lot of IB VPs went through hell pre Financial Crisis.  So why would you do it if you have an inkling that Midas may have been cursed and that money is not everything? Well first reason is that you do want all that you touch to turn to gold and you don't give a shit about friends, or seeing people, or being treated like a bitch for your prime years (but this isn't really fair to IB). There are two real reasons to enter IB:   Make it to the top Use it to get your dream job   You will only be hired if you can justify why you want to make it to the top of IB: you want to do deals, you want to work with exciting fast paced companies, you want to deal with CEOs, you want to understand how a business operates, you want to use your quant skills to assess and provide recommendations to these firms. These do happen in IB, but they take years and even MD's in a Bulge Bracket don't really get true power here; it's reserved for the directors.  Banks invest a lot in you (specifically in your quant training) and give you a great CV filled with doing analysis for top companies. These skills in quant and the wide view you have on industry is hugely valuable to: Investors (PE, VC, Asset Management), Strategy Consultants, Start-Ups, Companies themselves. Bulge Bracket M&A graduates with 2 years experience can take their pick of those places. If you work for Goldman Sachs M&A you can work for nearly any company in the world because of it. This is the key reason why I would want to work for an IB. The opportunities to enter those industries, even if you're slightly unsure between two of them, are incomparable to any other profession.  Note that IB purposefully try and weed out those in it to move on to something else. This is because banks invest a lot in your quant training and you become difficult to replace at VP level.   Entry requirements are finance focused degree with Quant. focus from a top university (Economics, Finance, Accounting etc.), this shows you're bright and good with numbers. Hard work and ability to cope with pressure, as evidenced by a structured hobby which requires a lot of time commitment which is done alongside uni work: such as rowing, rugby, etc. Not being a dick, are you going to piss off a stressed team in some way? If so you're not for IB. Interest in rising to the top of IB.  So a good family friend is a director for GS (won't give more info than that).

And if he is an executive, then his wealth doesn't have much to do with banking as much as it does with making it to the top echelon of the company. But at that point, you could pretty much become an exec at any company and make that type of money."

The second point - that you could become that rich at any company - is not true. The largest retailers in the world, take Tesco which are the 3rd biggest, do not get paid anywhere near the same sums. You'd find it difficult to make those sums anywhere outside of finance (unless you have an equity stake, which is not the same as your salary and bonus).  You seem to be inferring that this guy is misrepresentative of IB life.

The lesson being, if you surround yourself with crazy fucks, there's a greater chance you'll be in that 15% and drop out/""fail"".  Better to be a big fish in a little pond, or a little fish in a big pond?  It really depends.

I don't work directly with IBs, just do a similar role, have worked with some ex Ibs, have mates that are in it, know this guy.

Currently salary is $100K, my bonus last year was $80K (on $80K base at the time). Typical day is 9am - 11pm, with exceptions here and there (e.g., for the past two weeks I've been able to get out around 8pm since a few of my deals died recently). You're usually not working the entire time that you're in the office, since there's often downtime while you're waiting for comments on a deliverable.    Not a typical analyst experience that you'd see at a BB since it's much more client facing and there's a larger qualitative aspect to it. The senior guys here actively encourage participation in meetings so that you can learn the more strategy-focused aspects of investment banking.   It's a lot of work and I'm not sure if I enjoy it, but I'm certainly good at it. What's being good at junior-level investment banking work mean? Attention to detail, getting quality work done fast, and learning from your mistakes. Outside of that, you just have to maintain a calm presence and not get overwhelmed by multiple deadlines / to-dos."

I did a quick search and it looks like the ML opportunity may not be all that uncommon, whereas the startup may be a once-in-a-lifetime thing.  It could also lead to other really interesting unique opportunities down the line.  If the company does fail, it's possible you wouldn't have much trouble transitioning to ML or a similar position elsewhere at that time.  Also, there's definitely something to be said for waiting for an opportunity to switch over where you will inherit an existing book of business."

With a new BoB it could take several years to even get back to $180k in annual income if you ever can. You need to get a lot more information on how quickly you would be able to REASONABLY come close to that.   The ML job sounds like your typical entry level PWM job. Those are not going anywhere.

Also Innovo/HC/HMFI had a closed info session with Deloitte last September, so they offer awesome networking opportunities too! I know you'll be a junior but it might be an option.

FinancialCareers,3as02l,AnonymousBallsack,5,Tue Jun 23 03:24:38 2015 UTC,"Why are you just discovering this interest now?  That's what an MBA is for. You said you enjoyed those classes, so why didn't you recruit then?  Your MBA internship is the single most important thing to help you get into what you want to be doing post-MBA (read: forever) and you instead interned in Congress.  You come off as uneducated about high finance when you lump investment banking with equity research with PE.  Since you have an MBA, you must know EXACTLY what you want to be doing and reach out to people in your network who are in that specific field. This is not the same as networking when you are 23 and pre-MBA, when you cast a wide net and hope something comes your way that's interesting. Networking then involved finding someone who is willing to take a chance on you because they're an alum of the same school or a friend of your dad, and they think you're smart and capable of doing the job.  Now, post-MBA, it is much different, and you are woefully behind.  Think about your competition:  people who went to better MBA programs knowing exactly what they wanted to do when they came out and who gained experience in that field during their summer associate position.  Why should anyone help you out now when you don't even know what you want to do and you've already used up your career lifeline?  Think hard about the answer to that question, because that is one you will need to answer up front with everyone you reach out to who is willing to talk to you.  At this point you should be working your network extremely hard, but only after pinpointing exactly what you want to be doing and knowing everything there is to know about it."

A better path might be F500 corp fin which is reasonably easier to get into and from there leverage that into a decent grad program and then get a start a few years down the road.

Obviously all finance and banking jobs are not centered around Ivy grads, but the high level banks you have in mind certainly are. As someone at an HYP, I see too many guys get rejected from those big banks. If someone from HYP isn't making it, I don't know how someone from Clemson would fare.  Enough negative, though. Now advice. There are many, many finance careers throughout the country that don't require Ivy league education but rather require an admirable work ethic and personality. Clemson has a good reputation throughout the South, so I would start reaching out to execs in your region, maybe an alumnus of Clemson, and get their take on the regional financial work scene.  tl;dr Clemson isn't highly recruited at the level you have in mind; I would reach out to regional Clemson finance alums and get their perspective. Good luck! (Kelley could be interchanged with Clemson throughout my post.)"

In the interim ask the MD if you can work for free (since it seems like you need work experience and he needs to save money - plus the couple grand you would have made is kinda peanuts in the long term, at this point you want to have experience).  Emphasize how you will not be a headache and are not above doing the little things (printing and binding, getting coffee, etc). They might just use you for this, but they might also give you some higher level stuff since they are now short staffed. Could be an opportunity to learn more.  If that doesn't work cold call other firms and ask if they need any interns this summer. Would avoid the big banks and PE funds because their recruiting was done in the spring. Smaller shops might need someone now or in the fall.  When you go back to school see if there are nearby financial firms to campus that kinda do what you would like to do or at least have the same or similar junior level work.

As far as this summer goes, do what you can to do something that shows you filled the time as best you can. Take a class, volunteer somewhere, ask some other companies if you can sit in or do some work for them.

FinancialCareers,3aok2n,jyng,2,Mon Jun 22 06:24:29 2015 UTC,"I'm currently a business student but I think I can give you some advice on networking. I'm also from Vancouver by the way! :)  Like the other poster said, use LinkedIn. LinkedIn has a 30 day premium trial, which can give you access to a lot more professionals and also allows you to send InMails to people you aren't connected with. Choose the recruiter premium option that will give you 30 InMail credits, but use these sparingly.  First things first, use google. Make an excel spreadsheet. Make a list of all the companies you are interested in. Find out the email structures for them (all can be found online) for example, Goldman Sachs is firstname.lastname@gs.com. Find as many names are you can using LinkedIn Premium filtering things such as company and location, and write down all the names that you can on your spreadsheet. For the ones that are a bit tougher such as JP Morgan, which uses their middle initial in their emails, you can use InMails.   The key here is quantity. Quantity > Quality. Make a template for each industry you are looking into, and send the same email to each person except with a different name and company. So far I've emailed around 100 professionals and have a success reply rate of 15% for phone calls, and of the 15, around 10 of the have led to meeting in person for coffee. This is for professionals in San Francisco since I'm vacationing there for a week btw, I'm sure you'll have a better success rate in Vancouver since you're around all year.  For the people you connect with, keep on their radar every few months and develop genuine relationships with them. When recruitment season comes around, they will most likely be open to passing your resume forward to HR and may even get you into interviews if they really like you.  I'm still a student and haven't really found an internship yet for the next year but this is what I'm doing and all it takes is one person to say yes. Keep it up man be persistent!"

If you do a proper econ program you do will touch on those topics as well as economics but you will miss out on a lot of math of course. Or you could go all out and opt for a mathematical economics degree. I see LSE offers one (BSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics). I'm not sure how it stacks up.  I'm not very familiar with UK universities or degrees but I know a guy who did MFE at Oxford after studying economics at the University of Copenhagen.

I hope I have the wrong idea but it would be a good idea to email LSE and ask about your not doing Econ (do take what I said with a grain of salt because I don't know for sure)."
FinancialCareers,3am9fo,elitelimfish,2,Sun Jun 21 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"ultimate goal of an IB or quant role at a BB.   This is a bit unclear. What kind of job do you exactly want? If you want to become a quant then you might need to get PhD or at least a masters. Also your mathematical skills will actually be relevant. It's quite a different path than IB.  If you want to work in IB (e.g. M&A) then you won't really need that much math but mainly a degree from one of their target unis (which is mainly Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, Imperial, UCL, Warwick and maybe a few other Russell unis). Obviously, a mathematical background always looks good but some finance/economics classes will actually be much more useful. Pure math is kind of an overkill for IB, there are quite a lot of people with business and accounting degrees in IB and even people with literature degrees. They mainly care that your undergrad degree is from one of the unis that I listed above and that you have a 2.1 or higher."

FinancialCareers,3ahalt,BostonWhaler_,9,Sat Jun 20 04:20:43 2015 UTC,"You will need at least 2-4 years of work experience for an MBA and CFA takes 2-3 years (if you pass all the exams) so you can do both. I think CFA doesn't give you as much credit as it probably should when applying for an MBA but it's still a plus. More importantly, future employers, especially in asset management, will look favorably upon candidates that have specialist knowledge such as CFA.  However, CFA is more considered to be an industry standard and mainly for people that already work in the industry. Basically you get credits for it but a CFA alone won't get you a job. It's more a bit like the CPA for accountants. For an MBA it totally depends on the school and it probably will have a bigger impact on whether you find a job in asset management or not. Actually if you get in at a top business school it's very likely that you will find a job in asset management even if you don't have a CFA but again, it obviously helps."

FinancialCareers,3ahalt,xenaga,2,Sat Jun 20 15:14:22 2015 UTC,"This. Getting into a top MBA program without at least two years of experience is nearly impossible unless you already have an incredible resume.   An MBA without work experience from a lower ranked school often will not qualify you for the typical post-MBA jobs since the expectation is that you have 2-6 years of solid professional experience already. You will still be competing for entry level positions, many of which will now think you are ""over qualified"" with an MBA. It is not a good position to be in."
FinancialCareers,3ahalt,Judowned,2,Sat Jun 20 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"I totally agree but maybe as a disclaimer: This situation is different in Europe. MBAs without work experience (MSc) are quite standard and actually often improve your chances for a good job. E.g. an MSc in Finance from LSE will significantly improve your chances to work in asset management in London (or else where in Europe). In continental Europe a relevant MSc is actually often a minimum requirement for top jobs. As a result of that MBAs are far less common and people tend to be older when they get an MBA. Also, it's less like in the US where you sometimes need to have an MBA to become an Associate / get promoted. Usually a MSc is good enough for everything, an MBA is more to boost or to change your career."

Plus you won't have to take time out of your career to go and study.   From that perspective I would go for CFA hands down.

He hated his first 9 months but then reached a decent equilibrium for the next 9 months, but he was definitely looking to leave much of that time.

Why do I care so much? They lost alot of money to a good friend of mine, even though he told them to pull his money out, they declined to (claiming it was a clerical error). He is in the midst of putting together a civil suit against them. The principals at that company are Dale Gilham, Lea Zerbes, Colin Owens and Janine Cox, so it's likely he will nominate them as the reason why the company performed so poorly with his money (while still taking their commissions mind you).  The standard line in funds like this is ""They could have taken their money out whenever they wanted"" (which is word for word what Jordan Belfort had his goons say.

What I meant is St. Andrews is a well regarded university and so you've got as good of a chance as most other universities outside the top target unis. It's a bit different in the UK with only a few 'target' unis, LSE, Oxbridge, UCL, and then Warwick is up there as well.

FinancialCareers,3a2s31,frustratedundergrad,2,Tue Jun 16 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"can't speak to #1.  As for #2... why?  Personally, I think its downright foolish to go into debt for graduate school when you have 0 work experience and have no idea what it is that you're actually interested in pursuing.  What if you go through with a masters in econ (which... who the hell has that other than an academic?) and then decide that you hate econ and you're stuck with a bunch of debt for a career path that you have no interest in anymore.   3.  Not a huge disadvantage, but you are at a bit of one. Graduating in May/June allows you to go through the on campus recruiting gauntlet.  You might still be able to take advantage as an alumni in the fall, check with your career center on campus. People who don't use the career center (which is free for students) and follow through on the provided on-campus recruiting are effectively burning tuition money in my opinion.  One more thing... job search is 100% a numbers game. Keep in mind that employers receive 100-200+ resumes for a single position.  That amounts to an acceptance rate that is drastically smaller than getting into Harvard/Stanford/etc.  People who thought college was hard to get into will have an even harder time when they face the real world and competing against others for jobs.

FinancialCareers,3a0f20,finnants,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:34:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty easy to score a high percentile rank if you are decent at math and fluent in English. Short story is, you'll get a lot of resume requests from boutique shops (for everything except banking), financial advisors and maybe some regional banks, but that's because they screen on certain percentiles. Think of it like resume dropping at a career fair in a lot of respects. Basically you won't get all that many interviews.  If you're trying to break into finance, it could be useful to show you're competent and are genuinely interested in finance, especially if you're looking into an analyst role that pulls liberal arts majors. It's just not really useful if you're already a finance/econ/accounting student"

All of the big fours have valuation groups, and then there are other firms like McGladrey, Duff & Phelps, etc.   With a 4.0 and a math major with an interest in finance, you could position yourself nicely for one of those jobs.  They are constantly looking for undergrads and is a lesser known path for people who are interested in M&A.

FinancialCareers,39ypcu,burnshimself,3,Wed Jun 17 00:27:59 2015 UTC,"You should most definitely not cross it off. In fact you seem like a pretty strong candidate, unlike a lot of the stories that you see on here.  For one, every strong ivy league school is a target school, meaning that banks target your school to recruit students from. This means a number of things. First, there will be presentations done on your campus throughout the winter where all of the big banks and many boutiques will come to campus to talk a bit about their firm and then network. Your career services center should have more information and a possible mailing list to help keep you abreast of these dates. These are invaluable opportunities to network and meet the bank employees on recruiting teams who will likely play a major role in deciding which applicants get interviews. Try not to be overzealous at these events, but attend as many of them as you can bear and meet as many bankers as you can. Follow up with them in the following days, let them know what you're interested in applying to, ask them any meaningful questions you might have. Secondly, being a target school means there will be on-campus interviews. Typically banks will select, from the applicants, some 15-30 students to interview in the first round. Whereas at non-target schools even getting in the door to this stage is an often insurmountable challenge, being at a target school greatly improves your chances of getting into an interview where you can show your stuff. Thirdly, when it comes to offering jobs, there are a lot more slots for target school applicants. Banks predetermine how many slots they give to each school when it comes to internships, and targets get the greatest preference. Whereas a typical state school may be lucky to get one student out of thousands of applicants into an internship at a given bank, ivies typically get as many as a dozen students into internships at each respective bank. So being at a target school is a huge benefit to you.  Looking at your credentials, you personally seem to have a strong profile for a banking internship/job. Your GPA is not outrageously strong, but is no mark against you in any way. I think you're selling yourself short when you say you aren't book smart given the GPA you're pulling off at a school like yours. Your major is totally fine for banking as well, plenty of non-econ/math/cs people work at banks. Being a student-athlete is a huge plus. Many senior bankers are former athletes and tend to like athletes. It is also a reflection of your work ethic, time management, and intelligence that you can pull off good grades at a prestigious institution while also taking on the burden of D1 athletics. Now, as a caveat, it isn't like the old days where someone could just waltz into Morgan Stanley because they quarterbacked the Harvard football team; but it does help strengthen your application. And, not to be crass, being LGBT is a benefit as well. Many banks have specific programs designed to attract LGBT candidates given the lack of diversity in the banking industry in this regard. You should look into such programs at each bank and also see if there is anyone from the LGBT/diversity initiatives at the bank you can reach out to. I am not sure of your sex from the post, but if you are female that helps as well.  Now, one challenge is going to be your lack of experience. Ideally you would want to land some manner of relevant internship your sophomore summer. While the deadline for jumping on that has passed, there is still some stuff you can do. Given your background at a major ivy league school, you likely have access to a wide range of successful alumni in the financial industry. While I would not ask for an internship from anyone at a larger big name firm (ex. Goldman, Morgan Stanley), you can reach out to some guys in smaller enterprises to see if they might let you work for them for the remainder of the summer. I would highlight to them that you don't necessarily expect to be paid and are a hard worker willing to do whatever the company needs of you to make yourself useful, but in return you would like to have some kind of meaningful training/experience in or exposure to finance. I think some alumni of your school would be keen on helping a kid get his foot in the door in the financial industry especially when it isn't going to cost them anything. Anything in corporate development, investment management, financial advisory, or fund management would be great. Financial advisors tend to have more flexibility to hire or bring in interns at will, so you might be well served to focus on that. You can also reach out to local investment management offices in your hometown to see if they would want a free intern in exchange for a little experience and a resume line. If I were you, the most important thing for the immediate future is for you to land something corporate or finance related you can put on a resume for this summer. Having a resume barren of experience in the financial industry is going to be a rough sell come interviews in the winter. You can also look forward if things don't pan out this summer and, depending on where your school is located, look to get an internship for the fall. I don't know what sport you play or what your schedule looks like, but if you're in a big enough town/city you can try to intern during the year or work at the school's investment office during the year to try to gain some last minute experience.  Even without any experience, I think you'd still be a competitive candidate. Good school, good GPA, athlete, LGBT is a strong applicant with or without experience. And if you happen to struggle a bit during junior year internship interviews, I have no doubts you will land an internship of some variety and from there can leverage that experience into a full time offer at a better firm.  One thing within your control which you can do is to prepare for your interviews and applications now. Get your resume together, skimpy as it might be. Start studying finance and accounting basics. Because you are not from a typical finance background, you will not be grilled terribly hard in financial knowledge during the interview; but, knowing your finance and accounting basics will be important to show that you are serious about a financial career despite your lack of experience/relevant major. There are a ton of guides to financial interviewing out there. This is Vault's 2008 guide, which is a little dated but the finance/accounting basics in it are still relevant and haven't changed much. There are others out there, Vault makes many of these types of guides. Your local library or school's career services library may have some of these volumes, but you can find enough online for free by googling ""banking interview guide"" or some derivative thereof. If you have no financial experience but nail the financial questions in an interview, you shouldn't have trouble overcoming your limited experience in landing a job.  As far as your confidence issues, I would suggest you just take a deep breath and put those worries to rest. You have a very strong GPA while balancing the challenges of being a D1 athlete at an exceptionally strong school. Having gone to a similar school (not ivy but top-20 school), I understand the pressure. But you can't stress yourself out comparing your accomplishments to those of your peers. Frankly, a lot of students at major schools misrepresent their accomplishments academically due to the pressure and competition the environment creates. If your friends claim they all have 3.9 GPAs and that makes you feel deficient, I would caution against believing all of them. Similarly, some of your peers might be landing great internships but a lot of them are probably well connected by their family and may be getting such jobs for reasons other than their own merits, which may be exposed when full time job interviews come around. Just focus on yourself and what you want to accomplish. The competition and intensity will likely peak with interviews junior year, I remember my classmates just being super cutthroat around that time.  Block it out, don't worry about anyone other than yourself and improving yourself in preparation of these job interviews. Another thing to remember is that these jobs don't necessarily go to the smartest applicants. While being smarter/having a higher GPA helps, these internships/analyst jobs could be performed competently by anyone with a strong work ethic and a 3.5+ GPA. You don't necessarily need the smartest guy for the job to be done well. Personality is a big part of these job interviews because none of the bankers want to hire an applicant who is an asshole to spend 80 hours a week with them. Some of the smartest people also tend to be socially inept or way too cocky.  As far as where to apply junior year, investment banks are probably your best bet. What division you want to get into is up to you and you can read up about that elsewhere, but very few hedge funds/PE shops hire right out of college and most hire only truly brilliant and highly experienced applicants.  TL;DR: Calm down, you'll be fine, try to get something going this summer and read up on finance/accounting in the meantime, prepare for junior year apps/interviews and you'll do fine."

Don't be fooled, though. Studying is a big commitment. I thought it was harder than my entire undergrad, mainly due to the wealth of material covered and the lack of time given to prepare.   300 hours is average to prepare for the first level, but, then again, less than half pass the test.

FinancialCareers,39shm2,Its_me_not_caring,7,Sun Jun 14 10:31:34 2015 UTC,"That is extreme overestimation. I mean it might be about right for people coming from a background where  forward is just a direction to them, but a person who has a degree in that definitely does not need that much time - especially for the first level where entire books are pretty much just courses like Macro 101 etc  Also the 50% passrate is definitely not among the people who put in 300 hours. People register, get their fees paid by employer then they realise that they do not feel/have time to study, put in barely any effort and then fail.  Also none of the people Ive met who took CFA put in 300 hours per level. My estimates are, if you studied some of the bits at uni and are smart its about 100-120 hours.   As for the value, sometimes its listed as additional requirement - I personally never had anyone mention that to me or talk about it with me in the interview. Than again I am in risk and not asset management."

Id guess you would be able to do the same with a number of topics.  Although I would not advise you to hope you can do it with that little study (I did not have time to read Fin Reporting...its a total brick).  Also - something to keep in mind, studying for the exams at uni and CFA is just not wise - depends on the difficulty of your course though. I sort of regret it, because while I did pass the CFA and all the exams, that 70 hours could go into improving my grades and then I could do Lvl 1 in Dec and still finish all 3 on the same date."

FinancialCareers,39shm2,chingwang,2,Tue Jun 16 19:08:35 2015 UTC,"I just sat for level III a couple weeks ago.  The exam is very useful if you want to do investment research or portfolio management, but outside of this, it's simply not very relevant. I've interviewed for corporate finance, PWM, and financial services, and it never came up in the interview, I've obviously applied to many, many more, and it did not even get me a call back. It did come up at the investment management firm that I now work at, and the PM basically doesn't consider hiring applicants that don't have progress towards it.  So at my firm, it's just another check box, and passing any of the exams in itself doesn't guarantee a job.  Level 1 can be done with less than the recommended 300 hours, but don't take this as a sign of how easily you can pass the next 2. Level 2 and 3 are significantly harder than level 1, and I doubt even 1% of the level 2 and 3 candidates pass with less than 100 hours of study. Just look at the pass rates, less than half of the people who take level 1 pass it, but many of them underestimate it going in and are weeded out.  Out of the serious candidates who pass level 1, more than half of these people will end up failing level 2, and approximately half of the people who pass level 2 will fail level 3.  I guess to summarize what I'm saying: yes, it's helpful in a very specific career path, but it's not something that can be casually done.  You have to take it seriously and you should understand that most people who study for it give up their social lives for several months leading up to each exam level, and the majority of them still end up with nothing to show for it afterwards."

FinancialCareers,39qf5y,SapientChaos,2,Fri Jun 19 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"At my firm we usually upload the account to eMoney, or use our firms holding company to hold the assets in kind so that when we search their name it's readily available.    Also, we show a one page pie chart of all of their assets when conducting a review.  2 copies are used, one is client facing with just the account/asset/asset class/ and value.  The other is for the advisor and has an extra column with YTD ROR, and ROR since account inception (or rollover).  This gives enough ammo for us to answer most questions the client has.  We find it best to maintain a 10,000ft view and restructure the convo away from individual stock info (we are not stock pickers but financial planners); to the overall financial plans, goals and risk tolerance of the client."
FinancialCareers,39qf5y,Murflaw7424,2,Sat Jun 13 23:52:45 2015 UTC,So do you guys ever recommend any trades in their non discretionary accounts between review meetings? This is something that I think a lot of firms lack
FinancialCareers,39qf5y,Murflaw7424,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right but a lot of RIAs are fiduciaries (series 65/66).  That being said it would depend on the clients risk tolerance/inv obj/and time horizon, but usually (unless they're in love with the holdings) we let them keep their current holdings.  Unless they are not inline with their investment objectives and risk tolerance; in which case we rebalance as appropriate.    The other issue is that a lot of RIAs don't have the research tools and trading platform's to handle those kind of requests.    Edit: we may recommend buy/sell these holdings depending on the client, and our sense of the assets in the accounts.  Typically we would only actively monitor on larger clients, since this is a specialized service outside our core objectives."
FinancialCareers,39qf5y,Murflaw7424,3,Sun Jun 14 00:44:26 2015 UTC,"Typically we would only actively monitor on larger clients, since this is a specialized service outside our core objectives.    This is what my previous firm did as well, and I think it's something that really should be improved, since, as you said, we are fiduciaries.  Unfortunately we can't be fiduciaries to only our top tier clients.  In my opinion, even if you determine at one point that the holdings are in line with the risk tolerance/inv obj/ time horizon, etc, I think your fiduciary duty also includes active monitoring of these holdings (let me know if you disagree).  I'm trying to brainstorm a way to offer a low cost service to financial advisors that monitors these assets for ALL of their clients, regardless of AUM.  I think it has the potential to be a strong value-add for both advisors and clients, and might consider looking into it further if its something that advisors would actually be interested in."
FinancialCareers,39qf5y,SapientChaos,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"I think that's a great idea and would love to work with you on that.    The problem with our firm and actively monitoring smaller accounts is lack of manpower.  We have 3,000 clients with 2ppl (out of an 8 person team) solely monitoring investment accounts.  The combination of clients, funds, individual stocks/bonds, manpower and daily market changes makes out almost impossible to monitor everything all of the time.  Technology could alleviate some of this burden but not all of it since you need people to call on these accounts.  In my opinion, this is why robo advising is gaining steam, especially for people with lower net worth.   We, and many other firms, are choosing this by bringing in younger advisors to help work our smaller accounts.    Now, I know this sounds classist and all but between compliance increasing burdens and paperwork increasing (I now spend close to 60% of my time on this) it only makes economical sense to work with individuals who have larger accounts, because this is where we make money.    We typically charge 1% to manage an account, all in. That means that we make anywhere from 25-60bps or .025% to .06% per year, per account, depending the funds and the type of accounts.  On a client w a $1mm account that would $10,000 in charges per yr to them or $2,500 to $6,000 to us.  depending on your book of business, (ours is almost $500mm) that's barely worth monitoring day to day 250 trading days/ yr.   For clients that have less that $500k investing they don't even male the radar, unless we are having a review meeting or they call in."
FinancialCareers,39q8z5,Crucial-,9,Sat Jun 13 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"Staying in touch with him can only help you.   I can't speak to exactly how recruiting is done over at GS, but at the banks I've worked with the way I understand it is that lower level analysts play a role in helping to filter applicants and pick out who should get interviews. Too many people apply to these positions for the banks to adequately review all of their resumes/applications, and the campus recruiting teams are too small to even review a fraction of the applicants. So it is left to analysts/associates to flip through the resumes, pull out the interesting ones, and select who gets an interview. Your friend could be on the recruiting team for S&T and may play a role in selecting who gets interviews. Now, that being said, most banks structure recruiting by school. Each target school (think ivy league and closely analogous east coast schools) has its own recruiting team in each division composed of alumni of that school at the bank who review resumes/applicants to their division from their school and help in choosing who gets interviews. Non-target applicants all get shoveled into a non-target recruiting bucket which is reviewed by a non-target recruiting team. So, given that not every employee at a bank is on a recruiting team, and given that there are a great number of non-target employees at each bank, it could very well be that he doesn't play a role in the recruiting process.  That all being said, stay in touch with him. If he is on the non-target recruiting team, he could directly help you get an interview. If he isn't on the non-target recruiting team, he will know who is and will help put you in touch with those people. He can also give you a good insight into his experience at the bank, what they look for in applicants, review your resume/cover letter, etc. etc. He's a valuable resource no matter how you cut it.  Now, a caveat. Don't expect him to land you a job. He's too low on the totem pole to have that kind of pull. He can help you get your foot in the door and get an interview, but once you step into the interview its up to you to impress the interviewers and close on the internship/job offer. I would also check to see how connected your friend is. If he had someone higher up at the bank pulling for him when he applied or if he has family connections to finance/GS, you might want to take that into consideration when you think about your own chances/expectations. It is kind of a sensitive topic, so rather than outright ask you friend if he 'knew someone', maybe just ask him how he went about getting his job at the bank."

Things that hold you back immensely:   non-target average grades (based off your post from a week ago) average experience ""I think im more skilled in excel than most bankers would be."" No. You are not. Not leveraging your alumni network (there's bound to be people on the street if it's a large school). You're friend at GS has no influence on the recruitment process. Look at VP level and above to submit resume to HR. Why you want to get into S&T if you're end goal is PE. S&T and PE are two totally different things (one is about investing, the other is market making, one is private, the other is public). This leads me to believe you think you know more about the street than you do. You're 12 hours away from NY. Find another metro city to work in.    There are plenty of other jobs in finance, I believe you're just chasing this imaginary vision of what ""true"" wall street is. True wall street is long hours, bureaucracy, middle to upper middle income pay at the middle manager level (Associate-Director), shaky job security, over specialization, and slightly more cerebral than your typical office job.   So do you have a shot at a job on wall street? Probably not. A shot at a decent mutual fund, insurance, pension (fund of funds)? Maybe."

FinancialCareers,39p1pu,financeIAthrows,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:03:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on the broker you are working for. I got licensed at Merrill Lynch in their trainee program, which sounds similar to what you described. I knew a couple guys who had similar situations to yours and they went on to become analysts for ML when they didn't hit their hurdles to advance in the training program. The thing is, they had to move to New York and they had recommendations from the complex manager of a huge complex (Washington, DC). Our complex manager was pretty good about helping you find a better fit if you couldn't hack it as a new broker (which the vast majority couldn't, including myself). I have also heard horror stories from other complexes where the the trainees who couldn't make it were just let go with no help finding a new gig.  So, you might be able to transfer to a new position at the same company if it's available, but I wouldn't count on it. If you don't want to be an FA then it probably isn't going to work out, but there's a chance it could be a stepping stone to what you want.  However, putting in the hours you need to succeed as a broker will mean that your CFA studies will stall. You won't be able to do both. I was in a part time MBA program at a top 50 school when I started at ML and I had to drop the MBA. CFA studies while trying to build a book as a broker will prove to be impossible, I guarantee it."
FinancialCareers,39nz2g,adam_kevine,5,Sat Jun 13 03:06:23 2015 UTC,"Short answer - Networking is your only shot since on paper you are not a competitive candidate.   Long answer - Recruiting happens in the fall for IB and other highly competitive finance positions with the vast majority of full time positions already filled by the previous summer's interns. The vast majority of those intern slots are filled via on-campus recruiting at target schools. That means that you are competing for a very small percentage of slots not filled through these channels. Of these slots most are filled through internal referrals (networking). Any additional experience you get your senior year won't apply since recruiting starts in September.  Your best bet would be to take network your ass off this summer or take the best job you can get, kick ass for a few years, and switch to IB/PE after attending a top MBA program. There are no shortcuts and there is a large pool of applicants who have been preparing for these jobs for several years longer than you have. They come from better schools, have better connections, and relevant internship experience.  If you are really interested in finance there are a lot of other positions out there worth pursuing. Do some research and see what you come up with. IB/PE/VC are some of the absolute most competitive positions out there coming out of school. Coming from a non-target puts you at a huge disadvantage and a 3.4 GPA with no relevant internships is realistically going to put you out of the running."

I suppose I can only speak as someone working at a bank, rather than at an SEF, but I imagine you might want to know what it's like on a swaps trade desk outside of SEFs.  No experience necessary for an entry level position. When I started this job half a year ago I had zero finance experience and was coming out of university. Having no experience doesn't preclude you from most of the trading desks, since desks usually hire entry levels right out of college. I would assume that if she's moving hundreds of millions, she's probably very good at her job.  It is also true that those who have a book in the hundreds of millions are getting paid large salaries and bonuses, and the reason why they get paid the way they do is because swaps desks are one of the most profitable desks on the equity trading floor. As is always the case, your bonus is tied to your desk - if your desk is doing well, you're doing well.  It's also true that the desk is not nearly as 'busy' as, say, an FX desk. At the bank I work at, swaps traders are somewhere in the middle - not too insanely busy, but not as calm as most other OTC markets. Most days are not what I would call 'relaxed'."

FinancialCareers,39fcu6,Hopemonster,6,Fri Jun 12 09:37:45 2015 UTC,It depends on what work/life balance is worth to you. You may be getting better work/life balance but the tradeoffs likely include:   A significant cut in compensation A ton of office politics Everything from pay to promotions to parking being based primarily on tenure instead of merit Limited exit options compared to the private sector  A big difference in intellectual horse power and drive vs. the private sector   I would definitely recommend looking into private sector jobs with better work/life balance instead of going the government route. Work/life balance isn't guaranteed in a government job but  most of the other drawbacks listed above will be.

Ask questions - ask a lot of them. Your coworkers will understand you don't know everything or might have a stupid question. Most will be happy to help, because it opens the communication line and it will make you more useful around the office.  Interact with your coworkers on more than just a business level if the opportunity presents itself. Everyone in my office is pretty social and sports is usually the topic. If you hear two of your coworkers talking about something you are interested in, don't be afraid to engage them over the subject. If you have something in common I feel like people are more apt to be understanding when you screw something up.  Don't be afraid to talk to people outside your team (this is something I did well). Secretaries, other teams, admin people, everyone. I am pretty friendly guy (or so I like to think) and I just talk to people - how was your weekend, etc. Nothing special. Being friendly with people even in stressful situations will pay dividends. I was lucky to get to know the head of our back office/ops department and even though I was low man on the totem pole, people above me would come to my cubicle and say, ""kostcoguy, I've got a big problem, can you call Susie for me?"" I couldn't always get the problem fixed, BUT I would always come away with two things, 1) what went wrong and how we can avoid it again and 2) how it can be fixed and when. Being that sort of problem solver is invaluable.  Figure out who the important people outside your team are and get to know them. I don't necessarily mean the C level execs - they're great, but they meet a ton of people and may or may not remember you. I work in commercial banking and the key people are those attorneys that write our loan documents, our admin people, and our ops people."

If they ever ask for something, immediately respond saying yore on top of it and make it your priority.  Try you best and always make sure anytime you are showing anyone in senior management your work you really took the time to perfect it.  Be friendly and network a lot. You never know who will be hiring soon!  Always always always when asked if you want to take on more responsibility say yes! (Only if you really can). But nonetheless, it usually leads to more exposure, more knowledge, a lot more learning, and your managers see that you're trying. Sidenote, since I started working, I have taken on essentially another 2 roles almost. It's a lot of work, but I have been able to learn so much about different areas and I also got exposed to senior management in different fields.

FinancialCareers,395oa3,DoctorFunk,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"This question gets asked a lot. Realistically networking is your only shot at IB or any other highly competitive finance gig and it is a long shot. Your best bet would be to take the best job you can get, kick ass for a few years, and switch to IB after attending a top MBA program. There are no shortcuts and there is a large pool of applicants who have been preparing for these jobs for several years longer than you have. They come from better schools, have better connections, and relevant internship experience.  If you are really interested in finance there are a lot of other positions out there worth pursuing. Do some research and see what you come up with. IB Full-time recruiting begins in September and the majority of those slots are filled by the previous summer's interns. The remaining slots are ultra competitive and most often are filled via on-campus recruiting or through networking. Online applicants have almost no chance unless they look incredible on paper."

The issues started this semester and are now coming to an end as the withdrawal symptoms start to taper off.

You're going to struggle to find a firm willing to sponsor you for a work visa.
FinancialCareers,3954wi,RIP_KING,-1,Tue Jun 9 10:54:19 2015 UTC,"My mental issues are basically gone, the relationship stuff is old news (got dumped) and I'm getting over my drug problems. It was literally just the drugs that did this to me and now that I've stopped I'm pretty much alright. The mental issues aren't chronic. It isn't work related in the slightest, I'm pretty sure I can deal with the stress.  Yeah the work Visa thing is a problem, which is why I can only apply to larger firms. Most people from my school get sponsorship pretty easily and I have some time after graduation to get my shit together. At home most of the firms rarely recruit analysts. Finance/ consulting are actually the most likely to sponsor me :(  What do you think might be some decent alternatives to finance/ consulting for an econ major? My minor puts me in the running for quant roles but I hate it. I interviewed at this Chicago trading firm and I ended up just having casual chat with the analyst there because I couldn't really answer any of the probability questions. I can't do combinatorics in my head..."
FinancialCareers,3954wi,RIP_KING,2,Tue Jun 9 11:22:33 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are just asking for people to tell you what you want to hear.  /u/douchy_McFucknugget is bringing up a sound point.  It certainly was within you to have those sort of 'issues' before, it is certainly possible to have them again.  Your stress might have subsided now, but you're not working full time.  When you get to a bank, PE, other high finance job and are working close to or over 100 hours a week, you think you will continue to be stress free?  It's only going to exacerbate things for you.   When you work long hours like that it gives you the feeling like you have little control over your life, which is probably something that contributed to setting you off in the first place.   Putting that aside, the good news is, it sounds like you have some quality internships.  Ask yourself: why do I want to do banking/PE? Is it to keep up with the jonses cause all your friends are doing it? Or do you legitimately have a vested interest in deal making, staying up til 2am working on powerpoints, and spending a large majority of your day in the office sitting around waiting for senior management to review your projects, only to have them dump mountains of revisions on you at 8pm and expect you to turn it around by the following morning.  Cause that is ostensibly what the banker life is like for an analyst or at a major consultancy.   If you are in the bay area and studying data sciences, utilize that.  Seriously.  There are loads of start up opportunities for you to become involved with.  Sure, they can be a crapshoot, but its ALWAYS good experience.  And if you land on a gusher with some good stock options, your banker friends are going to be jealous of what you're pulling in.  Working corporate side is SO much less stress overall, trust me.  I worked in consulting, and now work in corp strategy and the difference between the two is mind blowing.     If you're intent on working a high finance position, I would take whatever internship you have available currently.  You'll be much more desirable during on-campus recruiting in the fall if you were employed over the summer vs if you weren't.  Then, come fall when the on-campus recruiting is going down, put your nose to the fucking grindstone.  Go to every informational session offered by banks on your campus.  Be personable and try and meet people who you think you can relate to.  Have business cards made with your info on them. to hand out.  I don't think your GPA is so low that it precludes you from anything so long as your internship experience is strong.  Be prepared to be very outgoing and network your ass off if you want to get a high finance position and you can make it happen for yourself... just know what that all entails.  95% of my friends who went on to high finance positions burned out after 2 years and are now working corporate side and had to settle for a lot less money and are much happier having done so.  Just my two cents."

I was really trying to get an idea of how feasible that might be given that I'm not interning in investment banking this summer. The only reason I mentioned my mental health issues is to explain why I didn't get an extremely prestigious offer for my summer internship. I have opportunities at a financial-tech startup or a medium sized consultancy.  I'm fairly cognizant of my own mental health- it won't happen again unless I start abusing again. I'm much worse off mentally when I'm unoccupied. Working somewhere and slogging day-in and day-out is kind of what I need.   It isn't really data science, some of the courses just involve data science concepts like cross-validation, support vector machine etc etc. My minor is symbolic systems, it's very interdisciplinary and would be more useful in Academia- its like a fad minor at my college. The place I have over the summer is very quant related and the people who actually pull weight have PhDs in technical fields. Would be nice if it blew up, but the CEO isn't giving me stock options... do you think I should casually bring it up or something? They recently got some funding from a VC too.

FinancialCareers,3954wi,IamLeven,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:57:27 2015 UTC,Well if you're 100% set on what you listed:   You're pretty fucked for BB IB FT recruitment without a connection. You still will have a shot at boutiques. Maybe middle-market as I know firms like Piper/Stephens will take full-time kids without having interned in IB the previous summer. No-go at elite boutiques (obviously). No chance at top-tier PE firm but a small boutique may take you. If you ever want to end up at a top-tier PE firm you'll have to start in IBD so keep that in mind. Commodities is the odd one out of this group but very doable for a FT offer. Network hard with alums and you can definitely land this. I would say focus on this as it is likely the most attainable of the three you listed.
FinancialCareers,3954wi,Boocks,0,Tue Jun 9 10:50:57 2015 UTC,"1) By connections do you mean a strong network, or are you referring to previous summer internships in investment banking? Investment banks recruit pretty heavily at my campus so I have plenty of networking opportunities. Also I deliberately didn't apply to some of the bulge brackets so I could build a relationship with them from scratch for full time recruitment. What can I do to maximize my chances at boutique banks?  2) Yeah private equity is pretty much a no go. A friend of mine managed to land a summer internship at the biggest PE firm without really networking, which was pretty amazing- but that was an internship.  3) This is actually my favorite of the three. The place I'm interning at conducts quantitative research for institutional investors and working with commodity markets is fun. What makes recruitment at Hedgefunds less competitive and less dependent on networking than IB?"
FinancialCareers,3954wi,laststandb,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:32:56 2015 UTC,"By connections I mean connections... do you know anybody at the bank who will help speed your application along? Waiting until senior year for IB is an interesting strategy because banks will populate their FT class from their previous year summer analysts. Hence without strong connections this route is will be troublesome. Boutiques will be more about fit, so again, network. Hedge fund recruitment out of college is non-existent unless you want to do BO or MO things like risk. Some shitty HFs will take kids out of college but that's not where you want to start a career. If you plan on starting a career in commodities trading you either need to look at a sell-side bank or perhaps one of the more reputable prop shops that isn't fully algo driven. These require a completely different skillset than IB so if you're a fit for one you probably won't be a fit for the other."

I came into the business selling life insurance and from there got my 7 & 66 and I am close to sitting for the CFP.  I have not and will never be dishonest or misrepresent any product or service,  My biggest fear coming into this was being perceived as a salesy douche only out for my gain.  I take a counselor approach and focus on fee-based service.  I use mostly index funds for clients that ask me to manage their accounts. along with index funds we will use individual securities which is even less costly for the client. We don't even sell loaded mutual fund shares because we don't work on commissions.  You do not have to be dishonest!  All it is going to take is one other adviser to come behind you and shoot holes in everything you tell a client that is not true.  Sell yourself and your service to your clients..believe it or not, they care less about your skill in ""stock picking"" and more about how attentive you are to their concerns and needs.

I enjoy consulting people with their finances, I am finding it difficult to make a living though when my income is so directly linked to asset accumulation. Perhaps I should just look into a position that isn't (or at least not entirely) commission based?"
FinancialCareers,393p78,realist70,5,Tue Jun 9 05:19:32 2015 UTC,"look, it is really, really hard getting started. If you are working for an insurance company (which is where I started) undoubtedly, you are going to have to sell product to get paid.  If they offer an asset management program, where you can work on a fee basis, get your Series 66 and get affiliated.  Your clients will be better off for it and you will be setting yourself up to generate recurring income form a fixed number of clients rather than having to go out and get new clients to try to sell them something so you can pay your rent.  I feel the advisory world is going in a direction where we will be completely fee based and commission based product selling will go away.  It presents too much conflict of interest.  If you can find a brokerage firm where they will hire you at first for a small salary while you build your clients up, you will have less of the need to sell people product and more of the ability to give them what they truly want; Your advice. They want you to hold their hand and tell them how to fund college, whether or not to refi, whether to lease or buy...thats why people hire us. I am not saying people don't need life insurance and annuities, but the problem is to a man with a hammer everything seems like a nail.  get me?  The balance is out there, you just have to find it.  I have walked away from huge commissions in my career because it wasn't right for the client.  It hurt too, I was driving limos part time to make extra money for a few years, but I found my ""why"" in this business and I carved out a place where I can truly help people and sleep at night.

Return net of fees is the only thing that matters.   Let me know how your index did in 2008 verse a mutual fund?"
FinancialCareers,393p78,MisterMaury,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:12:07 2015 UTC,"Over the short term, sure...  Over the short term you can find a craps player who does well too.  Over the long term, fees matter heavily.   Particularly in efficient markets.  If anyone in investing tells you ""you get what you pay for"" they don't have a clue.   So much of investing is actually just sales people out to make a buck.  I'd be willing to bet that darn near every mutual fund that outperformed in 2008 has lagged the S&P in the years since.  Usually, the good ones undrperform about the exact amount of their annual fee."
FinancialCareers,393p78,noleynice11,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:36:31 2015 UTC,"Nice example when we had QE blasting the S&P to unseen levels. Why not look at mutual funds this year? Or look at them over a full market cycle? Sure, not every single mutual fund beat the S&P but look at a risk adjusted return. If you can come close to the S&P's return with less risk what's the problem?   ""Usually, the good ones undrperform about the exact amount of their annual fee."" What kind of statement is this? What is this based off of? What is a good mutual fund?"

FinancialCareers,391mi3,DoctorFunk,3,Mon Jun 8 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"I sat for the level 2 exam on Saturday.  The true answer is a terrible one.  It depends.  It depends on your educational background, work experience, family situation, work requirements, all in addition to the ability to comprehend and retain the information.  The general rule of thumb is 300 hours per exam with roughly a 40% success rate per exam.  How badly do you want it?  Are you willing to sacrifice six months per year for the next 3 to 5 years?"

FinancialCareers,391mi3,snakesnake9,2,Mon Jun 8 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"I've done (and passed) CFA Level 1 only so I'm speaking about it only based on that:  Coming from a background of chartered accountancy and an undergrad finance degree, I'd say the CFA is just a re-hash of what I already knew. Very few of the concepts in it are rocket science on their own but it's the sheer breadth of the material that gets you. But if you put in the hours, there really isn't much reason why you shouldn't pass.   Yes, the pass rates are 40% but take that with a grain of salt. A lot of who fail don't put in the time needed to study, either due to lack of interest/effort or because they work very long hours leaving little time for other stuff.   I wrote a little guide for passing Level 1 in case anyone is interested: http://www.reddit.com/r/CFA/comments/2tw0o1/this_is_how_i_passed_cfa_level_1_advice_for/"

FinancialCareers,391mi3,snakesnake9,2,Wed Jun 10 14:18:14 2015 UTC,"I took Level 1 in December. It was really really fucking hard.  Not so much in terms of the complexity or difficulty of the topics (that's not to say the material isn't difficult, it is), but more by virtue of the fact that there's an enormous amount of material and all of it is subject to testing on the exam.  Plus for Level 1 at least you only get about 90 seconds on average to answer each question.  I registered for Level 2 and perused the material and it looks much much more difficult than Level 1, so I can't even imagine how much time it's going to take to study for it."
FinancialCareers,391mi3,Sonu9100,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:11:26 2015 UTC,"Yes it does average to 90 seconds per question but that isn't saying much. It's a multiple choice exam and most of the questions you either know it right away or you don't, not that many require you to do long calculations. I can in no way say that the exam felt time pressured (unlike ACA exams for example)."
FinancialCareers,391mi3,unjung,2,Wed Jun 10 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"You must have taken a different test than I did.  The AM portion of my test had a ton of calculations and I came pretty close to running out of time.  PM session was much lighter, and I had plenty of time. But I was definitely pressured in the AM."
FinancialCareers,391mi3,ThisIsMyFifthAccount,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:47:11 2015 UTC,I also did Level 1 in December. I'd say I got through the whole thing in 1.5h and then spent the rest of the time reviewing.   In the PM I left half way through the exam as I had reviewed everything twice by then.   There were very few questions where I came anywhere near the 90 second per Q mark. One thing I do find that helps is being good at mental arithmetic whereby I use my calculator (which takes time) for a lot fewer questions.
FinancialCareers,391mi3,letterT,4,Wed Jun 10 14:49:41 2015 UTC,Very difficult. I've heard in terms of difficulty it goes:  CFA>CPA>BAR  I don't know how true that is so someone feel free to correct me.

FinancialCareers,391mi3,unjung,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to all of it, but I did just take level 1. It really does test your conceptual knowledge, a lot of the questions are subtly tricky. They give answers that seem right or seem like their about one topic when you need knowledge on another topic to be able to answer it correctly. If you only know the material on a surface level you easily get caught up. Level one is wide in terms of breadth as well, it's tough if you don't have any business/finance background; a lot of new ideas to learn.  I think people don't get the actual designation because it requires a lot. More people are taking the test as something to show that they are qualified or to put on their resumes; I don't know the numbers, but I'm sure the number of people who take the tests is far greater than the number of people who have the designation."
FinancialCareers,391mi3,wnkender,-2,Mon Jun 8 22:11:25 2015 UTC,Low Pass rates are misleading though and driven largely by non native english speakers failing the exam and more people without any financial knowledge writing.
FinancialCareers,391mi3,searchmotivation,7,Mon Jun 8 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"incorrect. PERHAPS for the written portion of level 3, but there's no evidence backing that up.   The pass rates are low because the material tested is difficult, the exam format is difficult where the alternative wrong answers are very close to the real one, plus the vastness of the material 2000+ pages where anything, and I mean anything can be tested."
FinancialCareers,391mi3,Its_me_not_caring,5,Mon Jun 8 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, there's an argument the Chinese are bringing up the passing rate by virtue of their math skills (not that CFA math is hard, but if you can cram every single formula and apply correctly, that'll get you some points).   I think unless CFAI tells us by-country pass rates, we're all just guessing."

FinancialCareers,38tq6f,bb1289,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:44:56 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy it. Its a technical role, you get plenty of chances to get stuck into modelling and credit analysis. Its good working on large deals, you interface in with number of sections of the bank. notably syndications, High Yield, and you certainly learn a lot in terms of business models and how businesses operate and their drivers.   I don't think you necessarily get the granularity you do in M&A, they seem to go to a whole different level in terms of strategic interaction and drivers of revenue/ebitda/cash flows etc. Also, a lot of our operating models are based upon the op models we receive from the sponsors we work with in that wee take their drivers and then build our own cases of of them. However I think at a junior level you can get a bit more responsibility. That could also be because we are chronically understaffed.  I'm lucky in that my team originates and structures deals. Lev fin in a lot of other places seem to operate as a strict product area, it just so happens my bank is a pretty big debt house and a lot of the relationships (in some sectors) are driven through lev fin.   Another plus is that the job (in my experience) is much more cyclical in terms of working hours. We work hard and long when we are in the midst of a deal, things quieten down, then we go again.

Personal interaction is needed in a lot of the financial services industry, ER is not one of them.  This isn't coming from me. It's something I was told from a credible source in MS.

For IB and other highly competitive finance positions the vast majority of full time positions are filled by the previous summer's interns. The vast majority of those intern slots are filled via on-campus recruiting at target schools. That means that you are competing for a very small percentage of slots not filled through these channels. Of these slots most are filled through internal referrals (networking).  You need to start reaching out to anyone you have a connection to that works for the companies you are interested. This would be alumni from your school, family friends, etc. Look them up on LinkedIn and message them or go through your schools alumni database."

Your real concerns should be financing and planning your trip. Cost of living in London is pretty absurd, that could be a -. France is a pretty convenient starting location to travel internationally, that could be a +. These sorts of things should be your heavily weighted factors. You only go abroad once! It's an incredible time, equip yourself to do it the way you want."

If so, London or China would give you the best shot at finding a relevant finance internship.  A lot will also depend on the type of courses offered in each country - are they relevant to your major at all or are they liberal arts/humanities based?"

I don't think it had an effect one way or another on my ultimate career prospects and where I am now.  I will say though, at the time I had been considering getting into banking.  US banks refused to interview prospective interns while abroad, even though they had offices in London.  This may have changed since I studied there about 10 years ago, but that was my experience.  I ultimately didn't get a banking internship cause I was unable to interview for one, and never went into banking.  I don't regret that one iota though, every banker I know thought it was a miserable existence and burned out within a couple years."

You're more desirable to other companies when you are currently holding a position vs being unemployed.    I would recommend searching for another job while still employed, and try to look for something thats more related to deal analysis.  Could be banking, could be something else, but you need to get some sort of experience in that field in order to be more desirable to a VC down the line."

FinancialCareers,38i36x,lagrangeallday,3,Thu Jun 4 22:06:22 2015 UTC,"I went to Texas A&M for my undergrad, and Boston University for my masters... I would highly recommend both schools, but if I had it all to do over again, would've gone to UT and possibly CMU, Berkeley, or NYU. I LOVED A&M, but being completely objective, the math department at UT is much better. Boston university has an AMAZING faculty, and the department will REALLY hustle to get you in front of potential employers, so that's great. The only downside is the very low level of respect on the street, which I think is completely unfounded. But, I digress.  IMHO - grades just get you in the door for an interview. If your grades suck (like mine), you have to hustle. And there is a WHOLE lot of luck involved.   Perfect example - when I applied to BU I was wait-listed. I got a hold of the number to the lady who did the reviews of the applications, and on a whim I called her late one afternoon. I had been rejected by a few schools, and was honestly in a pretty shitty mood. I thought I would just ask (in the most professional way possible), ""WTF??"" and possibly address the elephant in the room (my undergrad grades). Don't know how true it is, but she told me, ""Well actually, I literally just sat down with a cup of tea to do the final admissions. Let me find your file... You have time to talk now?"" And BOOM, she liked me, and I got in.   When I got my internship, I didn't even apply to the position. I happened to have beers a few times with the guy who had the position the year before me, and he passed my name along. I didn't even ask, and actually didn't know the position existed. But I got a call one day and made sure I made the interview count.  When I got my current job, it was a lot of thanks to the director of the dept at BU. He heard about a position at a startup hedge fund, and got on the horn with a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy, and sure enough they had been contemplating hiring a second analyst. A few of us got interviews, and I am the chosen one.  I have gotten extremely lucky, but I like to tell myself I hustled for it. That's what you gotta do - just get desperate enough to make shit happen, and every now and again you get lucky enough to have good shit happen...  Oh. And know your shit. I am not at all saying knowledge isn't important. YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR SHIT. That comes way before all of this. (TBH - I should've paid a BIT more attention in my undergrad... But I picked it back up after some hard fucking work.)"

FinancialCareers,38i36x,Facialhydratingcream,3,Thu Jun 4 19:11:55 2015 UTC,It will depend more on what kind of work/internship experience you can get.

Its good sales experience and I'm now in commercial real estate brokerage but I could never do it for more than a couple months. The pay is absolutely shit. You get 55 percent of the first year premium on life insurance which is usually around 50 bucks unless you sell their permanent life products which are frankly not going to work for 99 percent of people you meet.

Investment Banking is very difficult to get into, and to be honest you probably don't stand very much of a chance getting a job there (not that you shouldn't try, because who knows what could happen).  It's a lot of work, and there's a very strictly adhered to hierarchy where you'll probably be treated not so great your first couple of years, but starting comp is more like the 90-130k range depending on the bank."

Do you want to do investing or operations? I wish I could give you an ""all-in"" resource that would explain all about Finance but that doesn't really exist.  My suggestion I guess would to be to just hunt around job boards for a few weeks to get a feel of the types of jobs that are out there and see if you can figure out what you want to do.

I'm in the latter group, it's too ""fluffy"" in my opinion. The same goes with some of your lines at the bottom. Go to a site called evisors.com, find someone in a finance function and have them review your resume.   IMO you should aim to move up within Home Depot. They are in Atlanta, so that should be your primary goal. If you can spin it right, it could be a great ""internal advancement"" story. What did the recruiter tell you? That seems like one the most important piece to this story. Your conversations should be structured to ""ask for help"" on your resume and applying, don't come off like you're asking for a job.   If you can't get a position directly as an FA, try to get into something like AR/AP, something operations, sales analyst, whatever, then lateral to a more financial role. Do this if you get hired directly into a big company, preferably Home Depot, I wouldn't recommend this via staffing agencies because then you can just get stuck in a vicious loop doing that type of work.    For jobs at other companies, consider shortening your retail experience so as not to give away your age. That may help you pass the initial screening. My guess is that people may be inferring you are older from your resume, then wondering why you can't get in a financial role, and instead of interviewing you to answer that question, they just move on because they have a giant stack of resumes."

Of course, I updated it after graduation with a new GPA and some other stuff.  I asked her if she wanted the updated and revamped one, she said to email it to her, which I did. But she like the new one (the one you looked at). It was a short meeting. At the end, I she had asked me if I would want to move up in the store level and I told her that really isn't my career objective, I would rather do something finance related since that is what I went to school for. She also told me to add my Home Depot Achievements which I did, and sent it to her.  I did ask the finance manager for help about my resume and applying. He told me that Excel skills are some of the more important things that he considers when hiring. I asked him what the most important skills are, and he said VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, and SUMIFS. I know how to use those functions. I know I did not come off as asking for a job. He told me that most people freeze up when they are ask to do a simple discounted cash flows question. I wrote that down on my notepad to practice those without a calculator. But they guy seem to like me.

The one thing I will say about S&T (speaking mostly about cash equities generalists at BB) is that it's a grind and exhausting.   You're in very early, and after market closes you have to sometimes entertain clients and that can take you late into the night. Furthermore, generalists have to stay on top of hundreds of stocks, buyside clients and research analysts. It's really overwhelming. I'm on the buyside and I have sales coverage from every major broker/investment bank and I see how stretched some of them are. It's not an easy job. It may seem awesome that your job is to take clients to sporting events, golf outings, expensive dinners etc., but know that it's physically (late nights) and mentally exhausting (staying on top of hundreds of stocks + macro and econ news).  If you're talking about trading as opposed to sales, they usually leave right after market closes and there's less entertaining involved, but trading can be stressful and demandind as well in its own way."

I think emphasizing your coding skillsets would even hinder you by making you seem like someone who would be a better fit for other careers, or for a technology group rather than IBD. In a first round resume screen at a target school, they will almost certainly decide whether to throw your resume away or not before they would notice whatever coding experience you have, which is generally listed at the bottom of a resume.  It doesn't matter that you are from a small town- use your alumni network and cold emails to set up phone calls and trips to the city.

Simply put, there are a lot of things they want to see from an Analyst, perhaps excessively so, yet coding skill is not one of them.  I wouldn't focus on learning it unless you know Excel  modelling (3 statement, LBOs, DCFs) and macro scripting in and out. And I wouldn't even consider Excel useful compared to just really understanding finance and the markets and developing knowledge on an industry or product group within IBD such that you could speak knowledgably about it.  Yet more important than that IMO is just being a good interviewer, which you could do by reading through interview guides, practicing questions by yourself or friends (record your answers and perfect them) and making sure your resume conveys your personal value prop as best as possible.  Unless you go to a target school and have a good shot at a first round, networking is more important than all of these perhaps.

Since you don't seem to be in an explicitly bad position which would require you to go back for a fifth year, I would caution against intentionally going for a five year plan. First of all, I feel you're placing too much weight on the difference between BB and boutiques. I feel taking a full-time offer with a boutique after your junior year is much better than turning it down for a chance at a BB internship which would give you a chance at a full time offer and require you to come back for a fifth year. Frankly there are plenty of boutiques out there that do just as well as BB banks. Their training programs are not as established, and they may have a different type of work environment; but bb doesn't command that much of a premium over a boutique. I mean an extra year of school is going to cost at least $10-$20k in tuition, depending on where you go to school and how many credits you take. And then there's the ~$65k+ in lost income depending on where you work. I agree starting your career in the right place is worth a lot, but I don't know that the difference there is worth the cost."

Oracle publishes an enormous amount of documentation for free. If you read the Database Concepts manual for your version, I can promise you you'll know more than 90% of the developers and DBAs you'll encounter.  The best thing to do then is probably to write an application that uses both Oracle and whatever technologies you're already familiar with.

My advice to you is simple; based off this post I think you don't have a good understanding of how the street works and you should research further about it. Have answers as to why S&T or AM interests you.  Next, since you are a rising senior and I am assuming you don't have an internship this summer you are out of luck with landing a job at a bank. Take the time senior year to find a job that interests you and will land you in a major city. Since you are in the midwest, you should aim for Chicago. This will help you in networking with other financial professionals.   Finally, keep up your grades through to the end of senior year and have a few years work experience, score 700+ on the GMAT and apply to top 20 MBA programs after your third year of work. These programs have much better opportunities for on campus recruiting for banks, asset managers, and hedge funds.   Note on the CFA- It can help, but again it is a 3 year effort minimum. This is a lot of time invested and it is really only seen as beneficial if you are in a research related role, whether at a bank or investments. It's not a golden ticket to a job. The MBA route is a much better guarantee in landing you a better paying job in finance."

Start going to industry events, hit up people on linked in and ask for informational interviews.  Make your average GPA above average.  If that's not possible, double down on your networking efforts and make sure that the people that need to know your name, know it.    If you want to do asset management, the CFA can be a differentiator for you.  But before getting into that, ask yourself why you want to do asset management.  Studying for the CFA is fucking grueling, and its not cheap either."

Also our career fair doesnt attract many banks, just insurance firms which im not interested in, and that those firms look for actuaries.

But a cfa is cheaper and if you want to get into asset management that may or may not be sufficient (full disclosure, i have neither). As for networking, alumni network is a good place to start. I always answer emails from undergrads when they come my way and express interest in my field. Young professional events are another place to look. Big cities often have various groups putting on mixers for young professionals where you can meet others in a variety of different professions. Linked in also works, you can approach people on there and ask for informational interviews and express interest in their positions and say you are a student looking to learn more. If you go that route, target younger people closer to your age. Theyll have more relevant information related to day-to-day for people who are in entry level positions, and might he more inclined to spare you some time."

FinancialCareers,37nvtr,hakuna_matata23,1 point,Fri May 29 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"I would definitely take the CFA and despite what anyone says it is not difficult if you like finance. When I say not difficult I mean conceptually there are not many things that are relatively harder than the other on the test from one section to another. BUT where the CFA gets most people is the sheer amount of content. It takes hours and hours of practice to retain all the information. You would have to really nail down in your head that this is what you want and spend at least 4 hours every day for six months of quality study time. And that's just level I. Level II and III are completely different beasts. So are you ready to make a big time commitment for 6+ months, and work your ass off? Great, now you have met the minimum requirement to be considered on Wall Street. Unfortunately, it still doesn't mean much. It gives you consideration, but nothing glowing. So coming from a non-target school you really have to focus on networking. A LOT. You have to get your foot in the door somehow. And then shove it in their. I would say extra curricular activities or other experiences would also play a big role. Wallstreetoasis is a good website.  Honestly, most people who start out in finance want to be on Wall Street, but you have to find what aligns with you. But if it what you want to do, you can definitely do it. I mean Peter Lynch studied History and headed one of the most successful mutual funds. It's not impossible, but you have to be tenacious. Good luck!"
FinancialCareers,37nvtr,Olorun,1 point,Fri May 29 02:20:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, My next question is that what do you think of getting a CAIA instead of CFA? i was once a econ/ fin major and i only need to take 4 more finance classes to get my degree. So i know a fair amount of finance, but how much harder does taking the CFA increase since i dont have a Fin degree?"
FinancialCareers,37nvtr,hakuna_matata23,1 point,Fri May 29 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think having a finance degree will be the key point. Will it help? Sure! When I said someone with a non-finance background, I meant someone who has marketing/history sort of background. I would think as an Econ major you could take same classes which will count as electives which will help you sit for the CFA. At my university, they are called Financial Management I,II and III. Fin Mgt I is a basic fin class all business students have to take which talks about basic financial ratios, depreciation and amortization schedules, and the concepts of NPV, IRR, time value of money (present and future values of cash flows), APR, APY and other concepts. Fin Mgt II goes into much deeper detail discussing financial ratios, comparing different projects using NPV, IRR, MIRR, FCF analysis. At my Uni, this was an excel based class and we learned how to do everything we learned in Fin Mgt I on our financial calculators on excel, as well as go into deeper detail into financial statements of companies and like I said do different kinds of analysis and case studies. Fin Mgt III goes into much deeper concepts which I never took so I don't really know what it is about. We also have a class we focuses solely on Corporate Financial management, it is very close to Fin Mgt II but is not excel based and starts with a little more accounting. So you can see that they are similar and different at the same time. If you are just 4 classes away, you may need some help with specific sections of the CFA, but I don't think you necessarily need to go out and make sure you get that finance degree. Just my thought. I am not a CFA candidate. I did explore this between my sophomore and junior year though. Honestly, you would feel most confident if you knew what the CFA asks vs. what the CAIA asks. See if you can get your hands on a prep book and leaf through it and maybe ask your academic advisor/someone in fin. dept. if your econ degree will be a big handicap. If you don't mind me asking, are you going to be a senior in the Fall?"

Everyone knows you took an additional 9 hours or something stupid, in all introductory courses, learning shit you can pick up in a couple weeks on the job... If you want some value add, pick up a second major. Or, (if your school was structured like mine) you could get a double degree.  Are you a Finance major? I would recommend Computer Science (cuz WHY THE FUCK NOT?). If that is too quanty for you, pick up information systems or whatever it is called. (The Web Developy major in the business school. It is like an ""applied"" CS, for lack of a better description. It was called 'Information Systems' or 'Information Technology' at Texas A&M, IIRC.)  And because I cannot help myself and not interject what I think you SHOULD do, DOUBLE MAJOR IN MATH! You will laugh at all the stupid shit (""OMFG!! A DERIVATIVE!!! EEEK!!!"") your peers trip all over, and your resume will be TOTES PHENOMS. Math majors can do fucking anything. FUCKING ANYTHING. The ONLY beef I have with Math is that it is horrible at marketing itself, and as a stand-alone major (what I got), you can have a hard time getting in the door. Your finance major, in addition to math, will solve this problem, and make you a fucking god among your peers.  EDIT: Ha. Just realized I didn't answer your question. I did not have a minor, but I could pick a specialization in the math dept. (I.e. - computational, actuarial, etc.) Since I was a WISE young buck, I chose Math. Math major, with a specialization in Math. (AWESOME CHOICE /s) I almost completed an economics minor, but due to scheduling conflicts gave it up. (Would have added an extra semester, for one more class, and I got a job offer.) I have since gotten an MS in mathematical finance, and did some post-bac research in Computer Science. If I had it all to do over again, though, I would have a double degree in Math and Computer Science (or the information systems thing). (At Texas A&M if you double majored in two programs, where one of which was a BA and the other a BS, you would actually get awarded two degrees - a double degree. (Don't know if this distinction really matters, but it just sounds cooler to say you have two degrees. Ha.) I don't know if this is a standard thing everywhere...

However, there are a few avenues that can possibly to get you where you want to be:   Middle Office/Ops - work on CFA and pray you made a good impression to the FO Investor Relations/BD - you seem to have well rounded experience and IR isn't the worst place in the world (odds increase if you're a good looking female). Apply to Credit Rating Agencies (S&P, Fitch, Moody's) - This is where I started. CRA's are the best training ground for fixed income professionals.

FinancialCareers,37hg6k,mw291,3,Wed May 27 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be unethical for you to start networking, as long as your networking efforts don't detract from your performance at your internship. Even coming from a non-target, try to leverage any connections with alumni from your school that might work at investment banks. Make sure that when you network, you come prepared with thoughtful questions and are generally knowledgable about the role of investment banks and an investment banking analyst I think the fact that you go to a non-target actually makes answering this question a little bit easier. You can explain that you have a strong interest in investment banking, but coming from a non-target, you didn't have any readily available opportunities to intern at an investment bank. With that said, you've spent a considerable amount of time studying on your own and getting internships (like your one in PE) that will give you a knowledge base and skillset that is easily transferable to investment banking.  Yes. Any investment bank will initially give preference to a candidate with prior banking experience, but that doesn't rule you out. If you're good at networking, impress during interviews and generally make a good impression, you have a chance to make the jump.    One other point: make it your goal to get a return offer from this PE  shop if possible. It will give you much more leverage and make you seem like a more attractive candidate.   I went into banking from a non-target, so I've been in your shoes. Just be diligent and work your ass off if you really want to start in banking."

If your firm needs it, they will sponsor you and get you into practice courses, but studying for it ahead of time won't hurt.  Market microstructure.  Learn about the different exchanges and exchange-type venues (ECNs and ATSes like dark pools).  Learn about market data feeds, trading via API or protocols like FIX, and the basics of networking and data center topography since you're likely collocating with exchange matching engines.  Other languages, specifically scripting/statistical languages.  R, Python, Perl/shell scripts, etc. are important in addition to OOP languages like C++."

Some exchanges may require that you take a test (e.g. eurex) but with those any reasonably intelligent person could pass them with a few days of studying.   It really depends on the firm he'll be working for and who he'll be working for. If the firm he's working for is one of the bigger players then majority of that type of infrastructure will be in place already.

It'll take a long time and a lot of work unless you go There and spend at least a few years talking many hours a day and studying a few more. I know this because I'm a fluent Portuguese speaker running an ESL shop in Brazil.   Let the foreigners learn english. America is still the world's largest economy, by far. Even after that's gone it'll take another full-cycle for us to lose our cultural dominance. That said, we are still the hub. It doesn't make sense for Americans to learn every single language in the world so we can do business with everyone else. It's a lot easier for the ""forners"" just to learn english.   English is the universal language... you lucked out!   Career aside, there are many reasons to learn a foreign language. It'll really open up your mind and you'll see some immediate cognitive improvements, as well as a decreased risk (or at least delayed onset) of dementia.  If you do decide to do it, focus on speaking. I can't stress this enough. Knowing a language is not having a list of words and their translations memorized. Knowing and understanding the peculiarities of grammar are equally unimportant. There are plenty of services out there that are full of people from all over the world looking for a native english speaker to become language buddies with. There are plenty of digital resources to that end: chat apps on iphone and android, aside from livemocha and italki.  So when you say you know a little french, I am skeptical. Words on a page are abstractions. Grammar is just a syllogistic expression of the emergent patterns in language. It's equally if not even more abstract. Grammar explains language. It's a derivation and shouldn't be used to attempt to reach the essence. It explains mathematically what is much less precise and more dynamic.  Respectively, both of these, words and grammar, are secondary and tertiary to speech and sound.   I recently came across a book that goes into great detail about this:  ""Fluent Forever How to Learn Any Language Fast and Never Forget It - Gabriel Wyner."" I got it off TPB. If you can't find a functional tracker lemme know and i'll get it to you.  If you want more personalized advice shoot me a message and I'll give you some direction."

I've been staffed on multiple international deals and we hired outside counsel to act as translators and coach us on proper cultural etiquette. 2 years out of IB you might want to go somewhere else like a hedge fund where a lot of their strategies are algo-based.

If you want to get into international investment research, languages help... but even then, I've devoted ~10 years of very serious study to Spanish, and lived ~2 years in Spanish speaking countries.   Fluency takes a lot of effort, and it's worthless of you're not business fluent. Spanish isn't an extremely difficult language to become fluent in, and it's the 3rd most spoken worldwide (if I'm not mistaken, top 5 for sure) so I would say do Spanish if you would learn a language as a personal interest. If you're just doing it for resume material, learning a coding language would be 1000x more valuable. Also, Mandarin is very, very hard to learn, and some people study it for decades and can't get tone down pat. If you're not dying to live in China for a long time, I wouldn't bother."

It all depends on how big a shop you're looking for and what sector. For example, a lot of boutiques are in the OC area while the BBs tend to be near downtown LA. If you do end up transferring into USC feel free to PM me and I can recommend classes/professors/programs/orgs that would help you get into IB.

Honestly, accounting is good enough for a finance position. But it also depends exactly what area in finance you think you want to go into. Anything corporate, you could just apply and be fine, then eventually go get an MBA and work your way up if you'd like. Something more specific will require certification like a CFA depending on which area you become interested in. If you really feel the need to go back to school, I'd suggest getting an MBA. Also, you don't have to go Big 4 to get into advisory. There are smaller consulting firms out there, so feel free to look around if you want to get into the advisory side of accounting.

In brief: 1) Possible but unlikely. You'll have to network hard, polish your resume, and get a bit lucky with who is hiring and what they want (I.e. they are looking for a junior but more experienced than a fresh grad). You could also try talking to headhunters, they could have some leads 2) you'll need to do more research on this one... When you do start getting interviews, it'll be important to know what you want and what you're talking about. Saying ""I want to work in banking because I really enjoy ""X"" but then applying to job X, Y, and Z won't help you. If the diligence / modelling / analysis is what you enjoy, you'll want to be on the origination side of DCM / ECM or on a coverage team or in M&A. Lots more to it but hope that's useful. 3) I dont have an MBA but I disagree. Recruiting in MBA programs is usually driven by the program... Get into a good (top 20) school and you'll get interviews. Also, most MBA programs have diverse backgrounds for their students. Former bankers might have an edge, but banks also hire for diversity, and actuary is valuable / unique 4) try to meet people in the business and be curious and ambitious. MBA is a good idea if you can go to a high quality school (top20 minimum) ... Beyond that, I have doubt of its value (at least, for this career path). Actuary is a unique background and that's good, and like I said, my boss came from that background (though he did the transition through b school.. Not sure if he did an MBA)"

FinancialCareers,36pudg,lamulticam,7,Thu May 21 04:05:40 2015 UTC,"Note: I am assuming that you want to work in IB.   Unfortunately, firms do care about which school they recruit from. Top universities are target schools for top institutions, meaning they recruit these schools' students first, and they would only offer opportunities if there still are vacancies. If you are in a target school, you gain a tremendous leg up over everyone else, who have to scramble over leftovers from target schools.   If you are dead set on pursuing a career in IB, then my advise for you is to transfer after your sophomore year. To do that you need to keep your GPA as close to 4.0 as possible, and join Finance/Business student organizations, and try to get leadership positions within these organizations.   This is actually the path I took. I went to a community college, then transferred to a top 20 university."
FinancialCareers,36pudg,amra_the_lion,1 point,Thu May 21 04:50:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's not a dead set path in my mind. I've got a little bit to figure it out I suppose.   Although I guess it's somewhat of a stereotype that the big bucks are made there. To be honest I don't know the specifics of the other types of firms out there besides hedge funds, brokerage management, and vague ideas of other things (Commodities? Angel Investing? Venture Cap?)  Transferring would be a shame though, I love the ASU campus and the weather."
FinancialCareers,36pudg,amra_the_lion,9,Thu May 21 05:41:25 2015 UTC,"IB is the key that opens opportunities in the finance industry. If you want to work in hedge funds, private equities, or venture capital, a career in IB will open the door to these opportunities. Why? Because IB touches upon all of these lines of businesses. As an analyst you may have to value companies, which is relevant to HF; you may also have to facilitate the sales of companies to other companies, which is relevant to PE; and lastly you may have to help companies raise capital, either through bond sales or IPOs, which is relevant to VC.   Even if you are not interested in IB, HF, PE, or VC, the big institutions still offers opportunities in many other areas of finance, including trading.   And let's be honest here, if your goal is finance, ASU is a shit school. I just check the school's official employment report, ASU's finance major produced 4 IB analysts in the last 2 years, the rest of the students mostly found employment in the back office, and there were students who stilled worked as tellers after graduation. If your ambition is to work in finance, real finance, this is not the school you want to be in."

Assuming I get a couple of good low finance internships prior to transferring (PWM, Asset Management, etc) will I have a shot at a bulge bracket IB internship as a junior at Berkeley which could lead to a job offer? I am seriously considering a career in IB out of college and I don't know how much the community college will hurt my chances. I also understand my chances hinge greatly upon grades, internships, extracurriculars, and networking."
FinancialCareers,36pudg,amra_the_lion,1 point,Thu May 21 22:14:25 2015 UTC,"Community college will not hinder you at all, after your transfer. It doesnt matter if you came from a dumpster state university or trash community college, after you transferred to UCB, you will only be seen as a UCB student.   I would say your grade is only really important for your first internship searches, because it would likely be the only thing you have to show for on your resume. For full time, your grade is irrelevant if it is above 3.5.    So, I would say your priorities current are 1) keep your grade up, 2) participate in extracurricular activities and act in leadership functions, and 3) get an internship"

FinancialCareers,36pudg,AmadeusFlow,3,Thu May 21 13:30:14 2015 UTC,"In the context of financial careers, especially IB, this is just not true. The school does matter (a lot) and having the ASU name on your transcript is not going to help in that regard."
FinancialCareers,36pudg,ContentBlocked,2,Thu May 21 13:56:57 2015 UTC,You misunderstood what I said. Yes it diminishes your chances coming from a non target school but to think you don't have a chance because of that is false.

FinancialCareers,36oy18,thehypot,2,Wed May 20 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"I've hired & supervised about 30 finance/economics interns over the past 10 years. I look at about 100 intern resumes per year. I occasionally help with recruiting for other departments, but mostly this is just my isolated advice (which may be wrong depending on the type of internship you are applying for):   Reduce the Lowe's and bank teller work experience description. The important part is that you have held a job for a long time and are hopefully not a flake. Expand on relevant coursework. Instead of ""Economics"" devote a full bullet point to a project or assignment you did in the class (even if it's something every student in that class did). Having 5 bullet points of example projects/assignments/etc under education is okay in my opinion. Even if you are using a cover letter, add a summary statement that includes your availability (which should be repeating back the availability posted in the job description, such as ""I'm available full time from January 2016 through August 2016""). Also possibly include a sentence or two summarizing some things you are good at or are interested in working with (which hopefully are similar to what's on the job description).  It depends on the internship, but I personally don't like the long list of kind of weird sounding skills: ""multi-tasking"", ""team work"", ""computer"", ""time management"", and ""leadership"". With regards to Excel, maybe you could list some of the advanced functions you are familiar with such as lookups, pivot tables, CSE's, and Macros? If you are not familiar with those, you could probably spend 30 minutes with youtube and Excel open to figure em out."

Frankly you sound like you work in a boiler room environment and man, that shit is going to get displaced so hard when CAN and OnDeck get their shit together on direct marketing."
FinancialCareers,36kf7y,findthedog,1 point,Wed May 20 21:00:59 2015 UTC,"I run my own, I am a broker who will occasionally fund good deals in house.  I just met with the guys from CAN last week. They aren't getting rid of ISOs for direct marketing(it's cheaper if we spend the money on bringing clients to them), and seriously, Ondeck posts like 275k in net profit a year with a 25% default rate.  Keep telling yourself that buddy."

FinancialCareers,36mfbi,RIP_KING,2,Wed May 20 19:07:15 2015 UTC,"I would love to chat, I'll shoot you a message."
FinancialCareers,36mfbi,RIP_KING,2,Wed May 20 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"Certainly possible. You just need to spin you resume in a way that puts you on equal footing with bankers/consultants.  I've said this in another thread on this sub... Corp dev/strategy/bus dev whatever you want to call it tends to hire specifically from banking/consulting background.  You are perfectly capable of doing any analysis that they do, but what they are looking for specifically is how you approach a given problem.  Bankers/consultants tend to share a similar skill set in how they approach a business problem.   What will help you is if you're well versed in taking a business analysis, and putting it into presentation form. Corporate development is all about interfacing with the company execs, investors, and various other stakeholders in your given project.  You'll need to be personable, good at gathering information from within complex corporate structures, and of course analytical.  The fact that you're also working at a hedge fund doing highly analytical work means that you've got the chops, from a work product and work ethic standpoint.   I definitely think you can make this transition.  Do you have an MBA?  If not, you'll be looking at targeting sr. analyst / manager roles and working your way up from there.  I know the company I work for will not hire for corp dev at manager and above unless you have an MBA.  You can come in at Sr. Analyst and work your way up to SVP if you want.  It's stupid, but that's just how they work.  Other companies might be different, but that has been my experience."
FinancialCareers,36mfbi,RIP_KING,1 point,Wed May 20 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.  Like you alluded to, I'm confident that I have the ability to do the job, I'm just not sure if the fact that I don't have a banking/consulting background would cause them to automatically write me off.  What's the best way to pitch them or spin my experience to at least get an interview? I'm very comfortable in interviews and feel that if I can at least get a sitdown interview I stand a good chance of getting the job.  I don't have an MBA, but I am currently enrolled in a program part time as well as currently progressing through the CFA program (Level 1 passed this past December).  I put my MBA on pause to plan and pay for my wedding which was a few weeks ago.  The program I'm in is not very highly regarded (though it's certainly a good school), so I'm considering making a full switch to one of the top programs in my area.  The position I'm going for is Sr. Associate. So hopefully the lack of a graduate degree doesn't preclude me from consideration.  Thanks again for the feedback/advice."
FinancialCareers,36mfbi,josiahstevenson,1 point,Wed May 20 19:35:11 2015 UTC,"CFA is basically meaningless in a corporate role.  But, if you are intent on getting one, it is good as a fall back if you want to go back to equity research... but largely unnecessary for corporate work.  MBA will definitely help you, and the more higher regarded program, the better obviously.    I don't think you will be automatically written off, especially at the sr associate level.  What you need to do is show off that you're analytical, good at establishing a strong rapport with exec level management, have experience with presentation development (which you do if you're pitching potential investments to your partners), and have a genuine interest/knowledge in the industry that you are planning to enter.  From the sounds of it, you have strong work experience which I personally don't think would preclude you from a corp dev role.  But, as with anything job search related, its a numbers game.  Be prepared to shotgun your resume out to a lot of different openings in a similar field and see what happens."

FinancialCareers,36hyop,cs_9,4,Tue May 19 14:59:03 2015 UTC,"It will be a very hard uphill battle for you.  Typically, Corporate Development roles hire from people with banking/consulting backgrounds.  It's not so much that you can't do the work as much as it is they're looking for people with a certain ""polish"" and that think about approaching a project in a certain way.  You generally learn those things while working in banking/consulting.  It's not impossible for you, but you will probably achieve this best through networking with people in a similar role at your current company and hoping for an analyst position to open up.  Trying to find one at another company will be tougher (but not impossible). The benefit of trying to find one in your current company is that you are a known commodity in the company.  If you are a high performer, and personable, you might be able to segue.    Going for an MBA (full disclosure, I don't have one but work in bus dev / corp dev) would provide you with some fresh opportunity though.  If you were to land a corporate development internship while in MBA you should be golden for getting in at the sr analyst / manager level and working up from there.  I know at my current company, starting at manager and above, they will only consider MBAs.  And really only MBAs with consulting/banking backgrounds, but they will often provide internships to people with a more disparate background, full time positions are a different story.  I got in at my current company in a sr. analyst position and have been able to rise from there without an MBA."

It isn't garbage, and we just received accreditation this year, but certainly needs improvement.

FinancialCareers,36epyu,DoctorFunk,3,Mon May 18 20:49:43 2015 UTC,"Understood. There really isn't anything that you can do to make your resume more competitive (aside from maybe CFA).   That being said, if you are comfortable in sales and lead generation with an aptitude in finance, your best bet is start hitting the bricks and sending out resumes. You'll gain much more insight talking to FAs over the phone/in person. Every shop is unique, they all could want something different (data entry, cold calling, performance reporting etc.). As always, the key is to tap into your network and see if anyone knows anything."
FinancialCareers,36epyu,AmadeusFlow,1 point,Mon May 18 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input.  Yeah, I actually started with Edward Jones and that was funny.  There's no way.

FinancialCareers,36epyu,asianinciti,4,Mon May 18 21:02:04 2015 UTC,"Had a few buddies at BAML, maybe 1 out of 3 stayed? The two that left were not into cold calling but managed to stay through their exams.   All-in-all, the ones who stay in FA know exactly what they're getting into. The problem arises when you have college grads who want to work in finance and never had an internship getting pulled into an FA office and soon realizing this isn't the ""Wall Street Job"" they were thinking."
FinancialCareers,36epyu,asianinciti,1 point,Mon May 18 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"Right.  I'm reading a book about FA that was written by a former BAML FA, and I think it's showing me the ropes pretty well (but I also know that people write books to sell books...not necessarily to help people).  I don't know fully well if being an FA is what I really want to do - of course if the money is fine and I have fun, I'll stick with it.  I just have an interest in finance that is fairly hardcore but my technical knowledge is super lacking.  And I'm pretty naive about it all right now, to be honest, so maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong here - I want a job that is challenging, requires me to continuously learn things, and pays my bills.  Ideally, I'd like to be wealthy, but if I can make $50,000/year I will be able to get by.  I'm fascinated by the way money works; I think economics is something I could spend the rest of my life learning about; and I like to wear nice clothes.  :)  I understand these FA jobs are usually not what they seem - e.g. Edward Jones - so I'm cautiously optimistic.  I just want the aforementioned things and I want to help/work with people."

Large multinationals have BI people either directly in their finance/accounting orgs or supporting them very closely from another division. A lot of work is figuring out where to get the data, what it contains, how to automate it and make it most useful. Folks with backgrounds in BI are in demand in this area."
FinancialCareers,36glqe,worldtraveler135,1 point,Tue May 19 14:06:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. I was wondering what position you're thinkning of? I actually had trouble finding those inbetween positions but it's very likely that I wasn't looking for the right terms.  What I found was that usually Data oriented position look for CS / IS degrees and usually go beyond BI wheres as on the other hand you have positions that do not requiere modelling and programming skills with SQL or SAS.

FinancialCareers,36glqe,RIP_KING,1 point,Tue May 19 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"The reason why I'm thinking about this topic is the fact that BI is typical Information Systems (and maybe CS or Math) position.  I wonder a little if I might end up beeing to unexperience to go into finance and without a formal IS/CS background to go into BI.  I absolutly agree that a lot of the skills are applicable to other areas, we have a lot of contact with the controlling deparment (and one of my coworkers used to work in controlling) and there are a lot of similarities.  Basicly the question I'm facing is whether the hiring staff will have a reason to consider this - finance is for the most part pretty competitive so if they can choose someone with workexperience in controlling, financial analysis why should they choose me? The reason for my post is the fact that I read a couple of times that BI tends to hire controllers and I was asking myself whether it is considered a similar position.   To sum up: I totaly agree that analytical experience is apllicable to a wide area of positions but I'm not sure if Co/Fin/Acc would find this experience similar to one in a 'strictly' financial position. Thanks btw.!"

Basically all the major banks have presence in SF, so I would suggest you start there. Your best bet is with UBS, as I know they recruit from non-targets for their wealth management team. But then again, target schools' graduates typically don't go to wealth management, so coming from a non-target is not that big of a deal breaker comparing to trying to get a job in IB or ER.

CFA has very little to do with Investment Banking. The CFA is a designation that is geared towards WM and AM. It doesn't give you the skillsets that you need to learn like valuation, financial modeling, and the complex accounting that is all specific towards IB. You will barely see anyone that is a level 3 CFA charter holder in the IB division of large BB banks, unless they transferred from a different division.   I really think you should reconsider your options or even think about trying to transfer out of your school into a top 10-20 school. If you make it then it will open up more doors for you and the tuition/loans will be worth it in the end, given that you don't fuck up. The reason I say this is not becasue of the difference in education, but for the connections and friends that you will make. A lot of banks would hire a non-buisness major from a top 10 university, a solid GPA, and showing motivation to learn in finance than a finance major from a smaller college, with the same motivation and GPA. Unfortunately that's how I've seen it work and it does suck."

I work at a PE firm, so there are a lot of people with an IB background here and even though you are right that CFA is more for asset management it's not that unusual to see IB or corp finance people with a CFA. Quite a few people have it.    it doesn't give you the skillsets that you need to learn like valuation, financial modeling, and the complex accounting that is all specific towards IB   Sorry, but IB on junior levels is mainly doing presentation and pitch books.

Some PE firms also hire ""industry experts"", that could be anything, from former senior managers to economists.  IB (M&A) actually isn't that useful for HF but HF is quite generic term anyway. Some HF mainly higher quants, so people with a PhD in math, physics or CS, in that case IB is totally useless. Others focus on stock picking or macro trades so a background in equity or economics research is required, and so on... There are a few HF strategies where M&A experience can be useful (e.g. event driven) and some HF simply hire people with an IB background because they know that those people are smart and willing to work hard (and on junior level this is what mainly matters)."

What I would essentially be doing is inviting guest speakers monthly of all different areas of finance (IB, PWM, WM, etc) to discuss their jobs and provide networking opportunity for members of the club. As well as offer insight on finance internship opportunities in the area, and explore more firms in my area that can partner with my school for internships.   Would this be a good path to take? Now that I don't have the internship I wanted, I can focus on putting this club together during the summer.  It would be a good extracurricular to add to my resume, ""Founder and President of the Finance Banking and Investment Society,"" don't you think?"

FinancialCareers,35wgkp,redditwing,1 point,Thu May 14 20:33:01 2015 UTC,"Question is, do you want to work IB or PE? I am currently in PE and truthfully, anything can help. But do I need to use a bloomberg terminal for this role? Not at all. If anything you need to know bloomberg for trading and research more than IB and PE.   PE is hard to get into, most people come from previous banking or HF backgrounds.   You're graduating from UG or MBA? If you're graduating from UG then you should have a good school under your belt or the chances are highly against you getting a front office role in IB at a BB. MBA might be a bit more leniant but I can't attest to that at all."

Make sure you have someone who is transparent and doesn't talk game like a used car salesman.  The headhunters I've liked in the past were always very knowledgeable about the position, the hiring manager and team, and the company culture.  They were also forthcoming about important details like the company's name (you'd be surprised how many headhunters refuse to give this up!), whether the position is full-time/contract/consulting, the salary/bonus range, and other benefits like insurance, 401K/ESPP, etc.  I say go for the in-person meeting and gauge the person to see if he/she is bullshitting you - it should be pretty apparent within the first few minutes whether they know what they're talking about."
FinancialCareers,35qu1i,jn062181,2,Tue May 12 19:31:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I asked the person talking to me some questions about the whole process and they have been helpful so far. Hopefully this is a positive experience.

A company will contact him with a job opening they want filled and it is his job to find candidates. He is paid by the hiring firm and it is derived from the initial salary accepted by the candidate. Never by the candidate.  Also, good headhunters have an incentive to prepare you for the hiring process. So, pick their brain about interviewing strategies and negotiating compensation.   Best of luck!"
FinancialCareers,35qu1i,IBDDude,1 point,Tue May 12 22:17:59 2015 UTC,"Agree, good head hunters can become life long relationships moving you through the phases of your career.

FinancialCareers,35qu1i,eo10998,2,Wed May 13 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"In my experience, I wouldn't put too much into it. I worked with a number of recruiter types and most of them didn't have a desire to place me in a job that fit me best. There's a big difference between a recruiter working for the hiring company versus a third party, the former being more reliable.  One third party recruiter set me up for an in-person, got rejected by the hiring company, and a few days later the third party contacted me (different person) with the same position introduction as if none of it happened. This is only one of my experiences. Most of the time, I spoke with a recruiter and never heard from them again.  Things may be different for experienced hires, but that was my experience as a new grad/entry level candidate."
FinancialCareers,35qu1i,Leksington,2,Tue May 12 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"If you just graduated I assume you are looking for entry level.  Headhunting is great for seeking high level positions after you have a bunch of experience; for keeping you career trajectory heading upwards.  Headhunting is not so great for entry level.  What do you have that the head hunter can market?  A degree and potential?  A degree and potential is a dime a dozen.  It's worth a shot, but I'd keep your expectations low.  It will probably bear more fruit if you explore the networks available to you (family, friends, professors, alumni)."

FinancialCareers,35qu1i,Jovianad,2,Fri May 15 17:25:19 2015 UTC,"It's unlikely the recruiter will be of much value to you as a recent grad. Good recruiters are worth their weight in gold; they also almost exclusively deal with experienced professionals who are not necessarily easy to hire despite firms desiring to do so (by which I mean, things like executive placement, subject matter experts, and so on, who almost always have options about what they want to do and a company needs to sell them as much as they need to sell a company).  Recruiters then need to understand candidate strengths and weaknesses vs. position vs. culture of company; that is hard to do with someone who has no experience. Recent grads are ultimately all fungible in this regard.  So I wouldn't put too much stock in it. Take the meeting, but don't agree to anything and be aware it might be a waste of time."
FinancialCareers,35qu1i,AdmiralTiberius,1 point,Thu May 14 14:47:59 2015 UTC,"I would probably still be looking for a job if it wasn't for me getting in contact with a recruiter. What I took out of the experience was that recent college grads looking for work are incredibly common and lots of them are worthless, most recruiters know that and treat them as such, not trying very hard to find a good fit because lots of them don't work out and they are the least profitable to place. Still though, if you don't have any contacts or an exceptional resume, I think it's your best bet for finding a decent job."

In terms of other stuff, make sure you know the CAD market hands down. Make sure you know what sources and publications are good for Canadian content and make sure you know the bank you're interviewing with (each of the big5 is growing internationally, usually in different regions, know which, etc)"
FinancialCareers,35gv9l,sleepy-guy,1 point,Sun May 10 06:13:15 2015 UTC,"Because you said ""Corporate office"" I have to assume you have no idea what you want to do beyond presumably not working as a teller. Go do your homework on how big banks work and the different lines of business, figure out what you'd like to do, and then come back.  One of the things that is important is proving that you actually want to do finance. Your BBA isn't enough. If you have no idea what you want to do at a bank beyond not being a teller, you haven't done enough homework. For every position, you should be able to answer the question ""Why this specific position, rather than something else either within this line of business, or in another line of business"" without it being complete bullshit.  Join your investment club or whatever exists where pre-finance kids get together and hang out. Figure out from the older guys what they did and decide what you want to do.  You also need to have FANTASTIC grades. Canada is already such a small market. There are 450 Queens Commerce kids, 300 Ivey kids, and 600 Desautles kids in your year. There are probably 250 (on a good day) jobs that undergraduates actually want and can get across the whole big 5. Even if only half of the kids at those schools want jobs at the big 5, that's still 675 kids fighting for 250 jobs. In order to be in the 'top 250' coming from Laurier, you at the very least have to know exactly what it is you want to do (and why) and be in the top of your class. Either that, or know someone who will help you get your foot in the door.  When I was a 2nd year, I did about 20 informational interviews and another 20 or 25 phone calls with anyone who would sit down with me. Anyone who I knew who had graduated and got a job, anyone who my parents knew, even people I looked up on LinkedIn. The higher up the people the better, but you might not have that much luck trying to LinkedIn Dave Mckay. I always prefaced things like this (Hi, I'm J, I am a second year at XYZ school, interested in Finance, and am thinking about [your field] and want to know more. I was wondering if you had any time over this break when I could come in and talk to you, or otherwise had any time for a phone call. Obviously, if you don't have a connection and are just cold emailing off LinkedIn you might just want to ask for a phone call, but otherwise, try and go in if you can. You'll get a flavor for what the work environment is like (IB cubicles vs. Trading Floor) and the people on the desk will put a face to the name for when your name is on a recruiting list.  Take every advantage you can get, the jobs are so few and far between in Canada anyways. If you know someone, somewhere, leverage them. It also doesn't hurt to email saying ""Hey, I'm interested in your field, but am also interested in XYZ field too, do you know of anyone I can talk to?"", as people have friends all up and down the street doing different stuff."

FinancialCareers,35eh6x,IBDDude,1 point,Sat May 9 19:22:22 2015 UTC,Yes they do.  But you have to be from a target school and have a solid GPA. Otherwise you need connections.
FinancialCareers,35eh6x,FlorenceMartingale,1 point,Sat May 9 19:26:28 2015 UTC,Take a look at the placements of some of these programs to get an idea of which firms hire from them.  Princeton: http://www.princeton.edu/bcf/graduate/placement/  MIT: http://mitsloan.mit.edu/uploadedFilesV9/Career_Development_Office/Media/Class_of_2014_MFin_Employment_Report.pdf
FinancialCareers,35eh6x,LupusSuperius,1 point,Sun May 10 04:39:05 2015 UTC,"ohh thanks...  Also, i've heard getting into an Msc. program is relatively easier to get into than an MBA. I know the competition for admission is lower.   But to what extent is it true?  Can a person with a mediocre undergrad CGPA get in?"
FinancialCareers,35eh6x,FlorenceMartingale,1 point,Sun May 10 07:54:41 2015 UTC,"It is not true, based solely on the sheer numbers. There are TONS of MBA programs, and relatively fewer M Fin.   Additionally, the M. Fin. is considered a more technically challenging program than the MBA generally speaking."
FinancialCareers,35eh6x,z1z1,1 point,Tue May 12 17:37:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with the second statement. But some European schools I checked, needed particulars hours of subjects like Economics and Accounting in undergrad. So, engineers are ineligible for those schools, hence, less candidates."
FinancialCareers,35eh6x,dyang00,0,Wed May 13 08:22:25 2015 UTC,The only masters in finance programs worth going to are probably MIT and Princeton. Princeton has an acceptance rate of 5% and MIT is about 11% so it is extremely competitive for a top program.

FinancialCareers,35ecw8,naked_short,3,Sat May 9 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"BBs have internal and external treasury teams, so you need to identify which it is for. Internal is comparable to corporate treasury positions, while external is more of a service that BBs provide.  In other words, you are either support treasury decisions for your company or advising/servicing these companies.   https://www.jpmorgan.com/pages/cib/treasury-services"
FinancialCareers,35ecw8,mjvcaj,2,Sun May 10 02:25:10 2015 UTC,Yea totally. Definitely internal.
FinancialCareers,35ecw8,mjvcaj,1 point,Sun May 10 04:15:25 2015 UTC,"Difference shouldn't be major,  but treasury at a bank will be more complex and provide you with exposure to more products and scenarios IMO."
FinancialCareers,35eexw,squaregoespal,3,Sat May 9 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue with finding consistent salaries is that credit risk is a broad term. It could be for individuals, small business loans, or large banks doing counterparty and industry risk, with each varying substantially in the type of work you'll be doing and how they pay."
FinancialCareers,35eexw,shred_wizard,1 point,Sat May 9 16:36:36 2015 UTC,Yup for outside London that sounds typical. Risk roles are heavily capped in terms of salary and have basically 0 bonus since they are pure cost roles. In terms of progression it is the same as any non finance admin role.
