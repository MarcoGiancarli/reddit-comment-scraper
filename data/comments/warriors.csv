warriors,3e0ncb,furyousferret,5,Tue Jul 21 02:27:35 2015 UTC,Cleveland's lead designer is reportedly having nightmares about his failure.

warriors,3e0ncb,matsy_k,10,Tue Jul 21 15:04:52 2015 UTC,"the fact that they have the Jazz at 4 makes everything this site says invalid. Also, I think the Hornets have sicker jerseys than we do."

warriors,3e2vjd,chaoism,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. Plus I don't think anyone would ever refer to the dubs as ""Splash City"" cause it would be copying the Clippers ""Lob City"" or Houston's ""Clutch City."""

Splash City was thrown around by ESPN and some blogs for a bit but it never caught on. Because it's dumb and it's derivative.   Things that people seem to use: Dubs, Warriors, and that's about it.   However Oakland stuff with the Warriors colors also is often used. I've seen The Town (oakland's nickname) and The City (SF's nickname) in those"
warriors,3e2vjd,aldernon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"As far as ""dub ____"" goes, it's typically nation- others have pointed out, but GSW is tied more to the region than a specific city.  The Bay has the 49ers v Raiders and A's v Giants issues- branding specifically for either Oakland or SF would trigger bad tastes for part of the fan base. So it's general branding instead- Golden State, Bay Area, Dub Nation, etc.   The logo's a bridge for a reason- the Warriors span the bay."
warriors,3e2vjd,bqnguyen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:39 2015 UTC,Hitting on the idea that you're not a team for a specific city   Thats why we call it Dub Nation. Not Dub City.

warriors,3dz67v,the_dinks,4,Tue Jul 21 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"Bandwagoning isn't so much joining a team than it is leaving them. Teams need to garner fans some way or another. I joined the 'We Believe' hype (even though I'm closer to the Kings than the Dubs) but sticked with the team ever since. Having really fun players to watch regardless of being trash for a couple of years made it easy to stick, but I'm sure this era of preeminence will definitely attract lifelong fans. We can't really know whether or not a team's gonna bandwagon until they legit care only for another team.  At the end of the day, no one really cares though. It's about the love of the game than anything else. It's not so much what your favorite team than how much you love basketball.

Ws highlights weren't on SportsCenter.  I'd buy tickets to games and spend more money on beer and a hotdog.  I bet a lot of Bay Area folks felt the same way.  Love 'em, but dismiss them.

It's crazy because when I moved here two years ago I couldn't find any Bay Area sports team merchandise let alone anyone wearing any Bay Area sports teams. So yeah the influx of Warriors fans in Southern California is huge. Also I'm pretty sure the local Clippers fans jumped on the bandwagon as well."

About half way through this season, which is the first I've followed closely since I was a kid, I decided to support the warriors. I did so almost entirely because I found Curry the most fun to watch. So yeah, I'm pretty much the definition of a bandwagon fan. When I first posted people were super nice, they seem to care way more about their team than some arbitrary measure of fan authenticity. Easy way to turn a bandwagon fan into a real fan I guess."

warriors,3dt2ja,Irish_McIrishson,8,Mon Jul 20 04:32:20 2015 UTC,Haters keep bringing up injuries. Lebron said it best though. You gotta prove it on the court. Warriors did just that.
warriors,3dt2ja,2ndand1,-22,Sun Jul 19 06:35:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not a hater but be real man, it's kinda helpful when every team you face has there backup pg starting except the grizzly. Also and Steph's the MVP too."
warriors,3dt2ja,12jonnyb,16,Sun Jul 19 13:52:52 2015 UTC,Warriors had less injuries because we were allowed to rest our starters in the 4th  since we were so far ahead in games. We also weren't battling down the stretch for playoff positioning so we weren't driving our starters to the ground. That's the benefit of having a great bench.
warriors,3dt2ja,mattpiv,10,Sun Jul 19 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"Ofc it's helpful but we were the best regular season team. We were title favorites from like the All Star break. It's not like the Celtics won it all on a string of amazing luck. The team that was supposed to win did win.   To put it in a more biased: even if those teams were all healthy, we still would have won."
warriors,3dt2ja,12jonnyb,-20,Sun Jul 19 14:07:30 2015 UTC,well we all have opinions. But imo I think a full cavs roster with love and Irving takes you guys to 7.

I'm saying that they don't hand out Larry O'Briens for teams that look great on paper. They gotta earn it by proving it on the court."
warriors,3dt2ja,aldernon,4,Sun Jul 19 15:55:55 2015 UTC,"Yah, it is helpful when you have the MVP and no hurt players. Isn't basketball crazy? Try it out sometime, maybe you'll win too kiddo."
warriors,3dt2ja,papertrails_,3,Sun Jul 19 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not a hater, but an injured player isn't a starting pg- I'd gladly have gone against OKC with KD starting during round 1 of the last playoffs. I'd gladly have gone against any of the teams we faced's ""starting"" pg's, because their ""starting"" pgs would have been easier wins.  Warriors played the 'backup' pgs of all teams we played- because the other teams knew that those 'backup' pgs were their best shot at winning.  Staying healthy is avoiding circumstances that result in injury- coaches distributing minutes to not have players play entire irrelevant games (especially when gimpy), players avoiding dangerous plays, players not doing retarded shit like riding scooters or segways. Stuff like that. Not coming back from injury early- basically, getting healthy at the right time."

Watched a lot of so-so Warriors basketball in my time (Even when they were losing, they were a fun team to watch).  Thought they were good from 2012-2014, but had no illusions that they were good enough.  Just enjoyed my basketball experience.  Then, this year, from the first month in, I was watching them play basketball at another level I'd never seen before.  Just destroying teams.  Starters resting in the 4th.  Pulling away and burying teams, good teams.  It was incredible, and vindicated by all the other sports writers who also saw it.  Our team was top in the standing, best Power Ranking, getting attention left and right.  Going into the playoffs, they were the consensus ""best team in the NBA.""  Then, when they win it, a slew of B.S. excuses and dismissals and hypotheticals.  And I get angry -- ""Didn't you see the season they had?!""  Most of r/nba -- ""Nope."""
warriors,3drtik,togas73,4,Sun Jul 19 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"I remember watching that first month, and just being impressed with the overall intensity of the entire group.   They were really locked in from the jump. And the prime example of that was Steph's defense.  From game one, you could tell Steph had worked on that side of the ball and was incredibly focused.  Anyone who wants to bitch about his MVP should go back and watch those first couple games and see how much effort he put into each defensive possesion.  And that was the story with the entire team.  They  maintained that edge throughout the entire season.  They very rarely took a night off, and if they did, it was because it was a 30 point game going into the 4th quarter, or it was about to be.  You don't win 67 games by accident. You don't get to the finals with just luck.  They deserved every bit of that chip and those who don't buy it can just piss off.   Shit, Kerr got Barbosa to play D. What the hell more proof do you need!"

He doesn't like ball movement, execution, assists, fast breaks, and smothering defense?  He only likes it when someone slowly dribbles the ball up the court, passes it to ""a big man"" in the low post.  Everyone clears out and the ""big man"" muscles his defender with his back to the basket and takes a contested shot.  That's great basketball."

I was a young guy at the time and it pissed me off that after being crap for so long some people couldn't just let us enjoy it.   Now that I'm older I don't really give a shit what others think. Half the crap they spew is validation for their own feelings that they're regurgitating from someone else anyway.   I love hearing other fans in /r/NBA mouthing off. Start of the playoffs they were questioning our toughness -- we didn't have enough experience and weren't built as a ""playoff team"" (whatever that means). 2-1 down against the Grizz and they're calling us the ""Regular Season Warriors"". 2-1 down v the Cavs and Curry's the worst MVP ever. After we won? Everyone else was injured.   The goal posts have been shifted so far they're not even in the same stadium.   So fuck 'em. We shampionship.

When our team beat the Mavs way back, we knew just getting to the playoffs was a fluke so we just enjoyed the ride while it lasted.  The Spurs were always respected. They just play a different brand of basketball that doesn't cater to superstars and a run-a-gun type deal. BUT they've always been contenders.

We have players who have literally watched and studied players of the past, take what they do and do it better. Example being Steph and Dell Curry. Steph took what his dad did perfected it and brought it up a level. Younger players these days have the advantage of emulating MJ or Kobe and adding it to their own game."

warriors,3ds8wz,togas73,3,Sun Jul 19 02:09:53 2015 UTC,"They had the 93 championship w/ Barkley on TV today.  What stood out to me was the change in defense. Seems like the defense in the NBA is wayyyy more sophisticated now. Sure, maybe the defense during those times was a little more physical on an individual basis. But now it's a lot more ""advanced.""   I watched a bunch of shots in that game in the post and I'm like wow that would have gotten swatted/blocked so fast in today's NBA.  I think now because of the defensive changes it's just harder to score in the post, so people result to shooting. Thus, a higher premium has been placed on shooting. Also, the style was a lot more centered around fundamentals/mature style of play vs. now seems like the players are a little more athletic and try to play outside the box/ unconventionally."
warriors,3ds8wz,Iamthelaw7,2,Sun Jul 19 03:25:45 2015 UTC,"To add on to your comment, I would like to emphasize how difficult it is to score in the post. You're going to get double-teamed and basically mauled if you continue to post-up with inadequate spacing. Kicking it out for a wing or corner three-pointer is a pretty good strategy from the playbook because when you contest the post, it leaves the wings and corners relatively open. In certain offenses such as triangle offense where one of the objectives is to maximize wide-open shots, this fits perfectly.  Also, by getting into rhythm of kicking out to the wings or corners, it'll force the defense to spread out and thus eventually leaving the post less contested so you can theoretically start taking advantage in the post once you know the defense has gotten use to your kick-out three's."
warriors,3ds8wz,Iamthelaw7,2,Sun Jul 19 09:18:59 2015 UTC,"It makes sense, just a normal reaction by people learning to shut down post play when it was the focus on offense for so long. Also, rule changes made some impact as well.   Everyone needs a dynamic roster these days - good bigs, good guards and versatile players. I think the Memphis series kind of answered this question - good post play will always be effective, but with today's defense, you also need solid perimeter play for it to work. Like someone else posted here, spacing is becoming more popular because it makes offensive play so much more dynamic."
warriors,3ds8wz,Iamthelaw7,2,Sun Jul 19 23:37:33 2015 UTC,I'd like to also add by no means am I saying that Barkley wouldn't have a been good player in today's NBA. He clearly was a skilled player. But he would be expected to add more dynamic play to his game - base line mid-rangers and little more shooting. When players work hard on their shot and get better at shooting they improve so much these days.
warriors,3ds8wz,bqnguyen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:55:52 2015 UTC,"The dominant big man isn't the key to winning. It's a naturally attained asset that required little strategy or practice. Players like Steph, who were naturally smaller and weaker, had to put in the practice to improve their fundamentals in order to even exist in the league. You pair their skills with the intellect of strategically minded coaches, and you have a smarter, better flowing offense.  There are no dominant big men left in the league, and there will never be again. There will still be tall, strong players, but they will be much better shooters, ball handlers, etc.  Think human vs gorilla. Obviously the gorilla wins the fight 100% of the time, but when we fight smarter, the gorilla gets shot 100% of the time."
warriors,3ds8wz,thunder_piggy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the NBA is necessary faster. The average team score really dipped in the mid 90s to 00s. It seems like it's picked up. I also don't think it's necessarily because more 3's are getting thrown up.  http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats.html  I grew up watching Olajuwon and O'Neal. Those were some badass centers - super atheletic and legit post up skills. Maybe the rules have changed to limit their strengths? I don't know if Yao was that dominant. But 7'6"" though."
warriors,3ds8wz,5thEagle,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:41:00 2015 UTC,"The NFL and NBA (perhaps soccer too, I can't comment) are starting to realize what spacing and pacing does for your offense (and in turn, how to construct an effective defense by combating the opposing tenets).  Chip Kelly kicked off a lot of it in modern football, as well as Belichick figuring out as time went along, but a lot of that had to do with rule changes that make it easy for quarterbacks to now put up 4.5K yd passing seasons like it's nothing.  Obviously D'Antoni is the guy who started things off, but Spoelstra and Carlisle have done a lot too. Spoelstra actually got a lot of his ideas from Chip Kelly (there's a good EPSN article from a few years back on it). The rest of the league is starting to catch on, especially after the small ball Heat and the 2013-2014 Spurs ripping the league to shreds.  There's nothing wrong with a post-up big, or a ""dominant big"", he'd just better be able to keep up in pace and play on the other end (i.e. not get torched by guards) and hopefully hit a jumper from the mid-range. You don't see anyone complaining about Tim Duncan, even old as he is. I doubt anyone would have a problem with Hakeem playing today.  Personally, I don't think it's speed, because pace used to be very high back in the day; it just dipped for a while and is going back up recently. It's the combination of that with spacing and stretching the floor with evolving offenses that are able to get excellent shots from the three point shot which is becoming a bigger part of every team's playbook, Wizards aside (kek). If you have a big who can do his thing on offense in the low post (which is like Z-Bo, Aldridge, Blake, Horford, Jefferson, Cousins, and a few others, and many of them have shit footwork anyway) but can't defend further away from the rim, you just get butchered by a torrent of threes."
warriors,3ds8wz,zzMojaveExpress,-1,Sun Jul 19 12:33:29 2015 UTC,"It's not faster. It doesn't have to do with speed, it's the other stuff in my opinion.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, at 7'2"" and 37 years old, led the '85 Lakers in scoring at 22 a game. Those Lakers scored 8 more PPG than this year's Warriors. And they were only 9th in pace!  Talk about rule changes and more efficient styles of play, the emergence of the 3 pointer, young player development etc. But the game is not faster."

Maybe there is something to outrunning the other team and Kerr is well aware of it.  When guys like Gasol have to actually run around and defend guys like Draymond they get not just tired but fatigued over a 7 game series.  It is a recipe of balance and it worked, plain and simple."

It would be good for Ezeli to get more game minutes and it would also keep Bogut fresher come playoff time.   Edit: that is for regular season. I will try and find the playoffs one."

Bogut regresses further and Ezeli further makes his case for minutes, giving us an idea of what we can expect for our future starting C.  Draymond continues to do exactly what he's been doing and only further incites hatred from the league as a big mouth who can back it up.  Curry picks up where he left off and is in discussion for MVP again, but Durant comes back with a vengeance and retakes the MVP trophy.  Barnes continues to progress, hitting more open jumpers and even putting the ball on the floor occasionally.   Iguodala wins 6th man trophy by a landslide.  We gonna be shampionship again after going 6 against hobbled Spurs, 7 against Clippers, and 7 against Thunder, finally beating fully loaded (and weaker defensively) Cavs in 7.  edit: Forgot to add that people finally shut the fuck up about us having an easy road to the Shamp."

warriors,3dgme2,hiyer23,82,Thu Jul 16 02:54:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's dumb that Klay didn't win Best Record-Breaking Performance. The man had the best quarter of basketball of probably anyone at any level, EVER. He scored 37 points in a quarter and didn't miss once!  Peyton's touchdown record was historic for sure, but I highly doubt any basketball player will make 13 shots in a row in a quarter ever again. It's not even the point total, it's the fact that he didn't miss a single shot and 9 of those shots were three pointers, not layups or dunks. Fucking football bias."
warriors,3dgme2,teraken,16,Thu Jul 16 03:10:07 2015 UTC,"When I look at an award like this and try to figure out which accomplishment is more impressive, the question I ask is: ""Which record is likely to stand the longest?""  I'd bet anything Klay's record stands longer than Peyton's.  For 37 years, the record was 33 pts (set by Gervin, tied by Melo in '08).  Klay beat that by 4 pts!  In the 37 years that it took to break the pts/quarter record, the TD/season record was broken four times - three times in the last eleven years."
warriors,3dgme2,SourerDiesel,2,Thu Jul 16 04:49:15 2015 UTC,"I agree and I was a bit disappointed, that 37 was insane, but whatever Klay dropped 37 in a quarter and didn't miss which barring another miracle quarter will stand for a long time as opposed to Peyton's TD record"
warriors,3dgme2,dunzoes,20,Thu Jul 16 05:18:31 2015 UTC,That's exactly how I feel. Peyton's a more of a career milestone. It's hard to get super excited for a broken record when it's years in the making. Watching Klay's third quarter was the most incredible thing I've ever seen.
warriors,3dgme2,thesnacks,8,Thu Jul 16 03:17:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's not like someone woke up that morning and thought to themselves, ""Klay Thompson is going to score 37 points in a quarter without missing tonight"". It was completely unexpected and just... historic.  The ESPYs are just a popularity contest though, and the hierarchy right now is definitely NFL > NBA > MLB > NHL > MLS amongst ESPN's demographics."

I don't think a players reputation has declined so greatly in that sub after winning a chip EVER.

Edit: ALSO, what in the fuck is with the 'Warriors' fans in the sub saying, ""yeah, Curry shouldn't have won"". Sorry, what?

warriors,3dgme2,thedudley,2,Thu Jul 16 06:38:26 2015 UTC,"There was no flashy savior ""team on mah back"" performance from anyone on the Warriors the entire Finals series, asides from arguably Iguodala in Games 5 and 6.  What casual fans fail to realize is that the defense played like the Warriors defense is capable of, a swarming spider who clamps down late in the game, and that's a team effort not easily visible. Also, Iguodala forcing LeBron into shit shots is less apparent than LeBron bullying his way to the basket.  Finally, Curry didn't do much of his usually explosive flashy plays, but he put up quite solid numbers throughout the finals, and let the team basically play 4 on 3 for most of the series (not a coincidence Draymond had so many assists, at the expense of Steph). Again, this looks less flashy and impressive.  Couple all this with 36/13/9 LeBron and everyone's like ""wtf Warriors had an easy path and Cavs should have won"""

warriors,3dgme2,HoustonSportsFan,2,Thu Jul 16 05:49:11 2015 UTC,"I think JJ Watt's chances at winning were hampered by his weak, borderline invisible, play-off performance. Is he more athletic than Curry? I'd say so.   Is he more athletic than Dennis Kimetto?   Is he more athletic than Usain Bolt?   Is he more athletic that Volodymyr Svistunov?   Depends on your metric. If you want to base the award purely on athleticism as measured by strength, endurance, speed, or agility, or some combination thereof while ignoring actual performance outcomes; winning, breaking records and popularity then you are going to end up still not selecting JJ Watt. You'd have to tailor a specific cocktail of criteria to have him be the most athletic man on the planet.  It's best male athlete, it's not most athletic man. Best athlete. Heck if an athlete did a bunch of philanthropic work that changed the earth and cured cancer they should probably win. It's not most athletic, it's best athlete.  If shattering several records, making MVP, leading a team to a historic record, taking that team all the way to the finals and winning the whole thing doesn't merit at least being on the same ballot as JJ Watt in your mind then you are delusional.   Is Steph the best male athlete of this year? I'm not sure. Is he undeserving? Fuck no."

warriors,3dgme2,dubsallday,11,Thu Jul 16 05:40:27 2015 UTC,So he's not the 2015 MVP neither? He's not the only one of the nominees that led his team to a championship?
warriors,3dgme2,HoustonSportsFan,-15,Thu Jul 16 05:41:52 2015 UTC,Most Valuable not best.
warriors,3dgme2,bitchfucker-online,8,Thu Jul 16 05:59:04 2015 UTC,The best player leads a team to winning a title. The best player isn't the most physical or the one with the best stats.

warriors,3djlrv,bumpkinspicefatte,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:26:29 2015 UTC,"Probably because he spent three years at UNC and improved only marginally.  The thing about McAdoo is that his flaws (shooting) are so glaring that people lose sight of the bigger picture. There's also the fact that's hes way better in a spread system that the warriors run than in anything you see in college. Give him room, give him the ball close enough to the basket so that he only has to dribble once and he will either get to the rim or get fouled.  That being said, I was surprised he went undrafted. High character guy, plays hard, very athletic."

warriors,3d7hkx,thatlonelyasianguy,20,Tue Jul 14 08:46:51 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works, it's not a simple matter of addition. By adding Irving and Love, LeBron's performances in Games 2 and 3 don't stay the same. The situations, spacing, play-calling, shot distribution and everything is different. LeBron doesn't get nearly as many shots. You can't just plug star players that affect so many aspects of the game into past games that they didn't play in and assume everything else stays the same, that's foolish."
warriors,3d7hkx,GOATrieIrving,3,Tue Jul 14 12:59:19 2015 UTC,"Also, they lose Tristan Thompson who was an absolute monster in the paint. No way KLove can play D like T.Thompson.  Delly would have also seen less playing time, and I think Curry would have torched Kyrie."
warriors,3d7hkx,abrightersummerday,-16,Tue Jul 14 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah different. By different you mean much lower usage rate, and as a result higher efficiency because he isn't run into the ground from doing everything? Higher efficiency from far better spacing. Higher efficiency from Kyrie taking the load off the ball handling duties. Higher efficiency from more off ball play. Higher effficiency from having two of (arguably) the best three point shooters in the league for their positions. Kyrie shot 45% from 3 and Love shot 43% (though a small sample size). Both guys are the next best offensive players on the team and its not even close. The opportunities for LeBron as a result of not being double/triple teamed every possession and better spacing are huge.   TT played a hell of a series but the Cavs had literally no offense. Shumpert can hit a three, but sucked in the finals from either nerves or from his bad shoulder and groin injury. Same with JR. Delly played some great D in a few games but was putting up bricks and was obviously fatiged.  LeBron shouldn't need to take as many shots as he did in the Finals. Fkn amazing effort and performance by him, but he would have been FAR more efficient with Love and Irving around him. LeBron usually shoots over 50% and was around the 40% mark IIRC. Not good.  Basketball knowledge of peace."

I'm definitely not a doctor and also not familiar with Looney's condition specifically, but it seems as if it's a bit of a reoccurring injury that can only be rectified using surgery.

warriors,3db39m,futureslave,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"I think it all depends if he can develop into a real contributor. Because if he isn't any good it doesn't matter if he is healthy.

When the park was first built the South Beach area was mostly parking lots and rundown empty warehouses. Now there's billion dollar buildings, thriving resturants, and people actually head down to the ballpark area to hangout in local bars during games.   Yes this is the exception not the standard. It was a successful combination of design and location. The 49ers new stadium will not have this same success because of it's location and design. Even Candlestick failed to boost the local economy.

If a championship is not his top priority or OKC wins it all next year, he will never come to GSW.  But, I think it's reasonable to believe that a championship will be his top priority if OKC doesn't win it all. If a championship is his top priority and he's staring down a stacked Spurs team, stacked Clippers team, stacked Warriors team, rising Pelicans team, and a stacked Cavs team in the finals, then he's going to seriously need to consider whether he'll ever have a chance to win in OKC.  Cavs won't have the cap space to get him.  Barring something unforeseen, the Spurs and Clips also won't have the cap space.  That leaves the Warriors and Pelicans as potential options in the West and the Wiz in the easier East as realistic title contenders.  Unless there's a meteoric rise from NOP, the Warriors would clearly be the best team that could sign him and would instantly jump to title favorites with him on the roster (though not by much because the Cavs play in the East).  The Wiz would have the appeal of having an easier road to the championship and being home. So, the way I see it is that it will probably come down to 3 choices for KD.  OKC will be the favorite to keep him.  He will stay with OKC if he thinks he can win a title there after he sees how this season plays out.  If not OKC, it will be between the Warriors and Wiz.  The pros for the Warriors are that they offer the best team, the best coach, and a proven track record.  The cons are that the Dubs play in the West and KD would be coming to Curry's team; also, there would be some negative backlash for jumping on the bandwagon of a team that has already won without him (different from Aldridge b/c KD was supposed to be the next ""best player in the NBA"", Aldridge is ""just"" a perennial all-star).  The pros for the Wiz are that they are home, they play in the East, and he would be THE man on that team.  The cons are that they are not as good as the Dubs, don't have a proven track record, have a questionable coach, and may be worse than the OKC situation he would be leaving."
warriors,3d6oxj,SourerDiesel,2,Tue Jul 14 04:47:12 2015 UTC,Durant won't be looking at the Thunder next year and thinking that he'll never win there. They will be competitive next season and have real championship caliber players in Westbrook and Ibaka. The ownership seems committed enough to their success and have put solid pieces around them. Nobody should walk away from that.
warriors,3d6oxj,whyamihereWHY,3,Tue Jul 14 08:27:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that OKC is the clear favorite to land him, but disagree that there isn't a chance he won't be looking at the Thunder thinking he'll never win there.  If OKC gets a 3 seed next year, followed by a 2nd round exit, I would begin to question whether they missed their window to win a championship when they let Harden go, if I were KD.  The Spurs and Clippers are older than the Thunder, but the Warriors and Pelicans are not.  It could be a situation where the Dubs/Spurs/Clips/Rockets are in the WCF for the next 3 years followed by Dubs/Pels - OKC could be the odd man out that can't escape R2.  Not saying that will definitely happen.  But if OKC doesn't at least make the WCF next year, that would raise some serious concerns for me in KD's shoes."
warriors,3d6oxj,SourerDiesel,0,Tue Jul 14 13:22:33 2015 UTC,Thunders avg age is 25 and their core is the same age as the warriors core. Even the Pelicans are older and their core is AD.
warriors,3d6oxj,DaBear405,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:52:52 2015 UTC,"I realize that.  What I'm saying is that, up until last year, OKC/KD could always look at the teams finishing ahead of them and say ""that team is older than us - we will get better, they will get worse, and eventually we'll catch them.""  That's no longer the case.  The Warriors core is their same age.  The Pelicans are younger (I'm only looking at AD and Tyreke as the core there, and guessing they'll recruit a top FA in the next 3 yrs).  If the Thunder aren't able to make a deep run next year (not saying they won't either), it's legitimate to question whether they will ever be able to make it out of the West again - particularly if they finish behind GSW/NOP."

What I do know is that a high PnR with Curry/KD would be fucking scary.  Right now, a lot of teams double Curry on the high PnR (including Cleveland in the Finals).  Try doing that when the guy rolling to the hoop is KD..."
warriors,3d6oxj,SourerDiesel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:35:54 2015 UTC,Eh take it from a Thunder fan who has watched KD since his texas days: a high PnR would be wasting his talent. He can literally shoot from anywhere and his post up fade a way is probably better than Currys 3 point shot. He is elite as creating a shot as well so it shouldnt be too hard for him to score anywhete tbh
warriors,3d6oxj,DaBear405,-6,Wed Jul 15 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"KD strikes me as having too much character to run to a winning team and piggy-back off their success, but I also can't get that commercial out of my mind where KD is sitting up in the rafters of OKC, where there's no championship banners.  If it comes down to it ... will he determine that he, alone, isn't enough, and accept a lesser role somewhere else to be a champion?  Or would he continue to strive to be the one to bring the banners to a team that has none?  Will his own legacy drive him, or will loyalty?  Will it by loyalty to his teammates or to his family?

If Pop is going to make Aldridge work, you don't think Steve Kerr could fit Kevin Durant in? Durant would get 18 shots a game to Curry's 16/17, Klay goes down to maybe 14 or so, and everyone gets way more efficient. Like, are you kidding me? Two of the most dangerous shooting threats in the NBA, we'd get another creator and guy who can handle (on the wing!!), and we solve the tertiary option issue by making Klay less of a volume shooter and moving him ""down"" there."

If the hypothetical choice between HB and KD is somehow troubling you, think about it like this.

They reason: any team that emerges from the rigmarole that is the Western Conference surely must be much better than the top Eastern Conference team. But the Dubs didn't have to play those teams! Obviously they didn't have to play themselves or the Thunder, and the other teams massacred themselves. The West > East observation is way more salient among the lower ranked teams in the NBA. Hawks, Cavs, Bulls, Raptors, and Wizards were solid teams last year. The ""Eastern Conference sux lolz"" argument is lazy analysis.   Dubs road to the Finals was Pelicans, Grizzlies, Rockets. Each of those teams had injuries at the pg position that fucked up their chances against Curry. Cavs road was Celtics, Bulls, and the sixty win hawks. The difference in quality between their respective playoffs matchups is not so obvious to me. By the time the Finals rolled around, Delly was obviously able to out class Curry, and TT stepped up big to grab rebounds in Love's absence, but the Cavs played their worst bball of the year. That's a hell of a time of the season to lose two of the top five players in the series.   Matchups strategy matters. Warriors can't go small against a lineup of Irving, Shump, Lebron, Love, TT. That lineup has more pure talent and rebounding ability than any five players the Dubs could conceivably play at the same time. Plus Delly, Jones, Smith, and Mozgov could have focused on being role players rather than high minutes playmakers. That's suddenly a very deep and adaptable team, one that led the league in point differential in the second half of the season. Cavs would have won easily, and it's a shame that after such a great season fans weren't able to see the best team with it's best players on the court."

Having said that- we do have some of the best shooters, and we did win. So he can stick that in his pipe and smoke it.  For most teams though? That don't have a system figured out to take advantage of shooters and still get some consistent offense, or a pair of shooters that can drag you back into a game (or blow a game out) single-handed? He's probably right.  I'm just thrilled that we get to watch this team- it's way more exciting than a ""big man"" team."
warriors,3d638p,aldernon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that he is entitled to his own opinion, and I do agree that, in general, it's a big man's league. I'd love to have Steph's game tying (should've been winning) corner 3 over AD playing on the monitor when he said that Steph isn't as good as AD though.   He needs to realize that even though he was ""fundamentally right"" about the league right now, he was wrong about us! Must be easy to hate on Steph when he's got more rings than you CB!"
warriors,3d638p,chunksfriends,13,Mon Jul 13 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"Height wise, no Curry is not on Lebron or Ad's level. But shooting wise, Curry is on a whole other level."
warriors,3d638p,sum1rand0m,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"Such a dumb comment. If you swapped Lebron and Steph before the NBA Finals, what do you think would have happened?"
warriors,3d638p,savage_nobility,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"Livingston, Klay, Lebron, Draymond, Bogut, Barnes, Iggy, et al  vs.  Kyrie, Steph, Jones, Kevin Love, Mozgov, Tristan Thompson, J.R., Shumpert, et al  That's a pretty interesting matchup."
warriors,3d638p,HarryLundt,0,Thu Jul 16 03:54:58 2015 UTC,Wait was I the dumb comment? In that scenario Dubs could defend  against Curry since we got elite perimeter defense. But the Cavs don't have Iggy or even a versatile defense against Lebron. And comparing Lebron and Curry is like comparing apples to oranges.
warriors,3d638p,sum1rand0m,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"The point is that it is difficult to compare players who play at different positions. If we wanted to figure out a way to judge whether Barkley's comment about Steph not being on Lebron's level is correct, I think the best way to think about it is imagine swapping Steph for Lebron. Warriors would have swept the Cavs easily. Swap Iggy for Lebron and I think you'd get the same result.   By ""same result"" I mean=sweep."
warriors,3d638p,savage_nobility,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"You are right, it is difficult to compare players of different positions. But Lebron is an elite player among all forwards in the league the same way Curry is an elite player among guards in the league. Meaning Curry is pound-for-pound on the same level of eliteness within his position as Lebron. Lebron just has the advantage of being taller and stronger then Curry, in a league where height and length is everything. And you are forgetting Dubs have elite defense, who can go up against anyone you want to switch out compared to the Cavs."
warriors,3d638p,sum1rand0m,25,Tue Jul 14 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"I don't get why it has to be one way or the other.  Why does the rise of small ball have to mean the end of the big man's game?  Maybe it's more about the personnel, chemistry, and adjustments.  Maybe you can win with either style if you have the right guys to execute it and the right coach making tweaks."
warriors,3d638p,SourerDiesel,3,Mon Jul 13 20:39:50 2015 UTC,Yea I still believe him but not the way he does. Barkeley believe that it has to be offensively... I think it doesn't matter if it's offensive or defense as long as their effective. Tyson Chandler wasn't exactly a grind you down in the block guy. Ben Wallace either. They were both defensive specialists.

If AD was on this team we'll be playing him 40+ minutes.  But our biggest dudes aren't the most skilled (Bogut is skilled, yea, but he's a near zero on offense when defenses sag off him ala Tony Allen) so we chose to go with a smaller, more skilled players.  Turns out our small players are skilled enough to overcome their size disadvantage."
warriors,3d638p,elliott44k,19,Tue Jul 14 20:04:57 2015 UTC,"I like that he still says Steph isn't on the level of those guys.  Lebron is the best player right now and maybe ever, but Brows over Curry? C'mon man"

Just looking at the 2012 team -- the biggest MPG: Lebron, Wade, Bosh, Chalmers, Battier, Haslem.  I can't remember if Bosh has morphed into a full-time three shot specialist at that point but he wasn't what I'd call a traditional big man.  I mean, I love Charles, but he's wrong."

How many teams are going to have two shooters like that?   None. The Warriors may be the pure exception to the theory. Dallas may not have a pure low post scorer, but few could stop Dirk on his post fades. Miami had LeBron, Wade and Bosh; all of whom with a semblance of post moves. Warriors really have nobody that has a legit post game. Maybe we'll get a couple fades from Barnes, Klay, Iggy or a couple hooks from Ezeli and Bogut but nothing to really rely on."

Also, it's a false dichotomy: you don't HAVE to choose between small ball or big man-focused. More often that not, Barkley's philosophy is right.

My lord, we didn't win because ""we have two shooters like that"" nor did we win because ""we have a bunch of small guys"".   WTF, Charles?   I know you're not a generally bright dude, but you've had so many chances to explain why your theory is still generally right, because the GSW won with defense, not really due to ""small ball.""  We didn't win because Curry and Thompson shot the lights out. We didn't win because we have lots of quick shooters on the outside (remember how Orlando w/ Howard used to play, or how the Rockets kinda play?   Or how the Warriors USED TO PLAY back in our Believe Days?). We won with defensive stops and then smart ball movement (like the Spurs).  The Cavs defense was woeful in the last two games, and they never changed it up.  They double Curry, then he passes and we run a 4 on 3 offense, with the open guy taking an uncontested shot.   On the rare occasion they didn't double Curry, we just rotate their big men away from the basket on switches that they can't recover from.  But most of our offense was due to their overplaying Curry.  Iggy and Green and Barnes had endless open looks.  Thankfully, they hit enough of them."
warriors,3d638p,Milktea4me,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"That was kind of strange. I know Steph is an unconscious 3pt shooter, but he was human in the playoffs. Why continue to double when the Warriors clearly have an answer for that."
warriors,3d638p,VegasRon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:33:18 2015 UTC,The Cavs played let the other guys beat you kinda game and it worked for the most part. The reason they started doing big things is other guys started hitting the shots and that helped Steph get a little more space. That along with Delly getting tired. Steph wasn't really human Game 4 and Game 5. He hit his first 3 3 pointers in Game 5 with guys draped all over him and doubling/hedging him off of screens. He ended up 7 of 13.Game 4 he had a stretch during the 3rd and 4th and he still went off. He still shot 39% in the series with two pretty terrible games shooting: Game 2 and Game 6.

warriors,3d3imf,pftcommentator,11,Mon Jul 13 07:53:43 2015 UTC,"I dunno about both of them being healthy being better. Kevin Love is one of my favorite players in the league to watch, but I think if Love is healthy and Irving isn't, we win in 5 in a more comfortable series.   Cleveland doesn't use him right in that offense; he's a glorified spot-up shooter that can snag some boards. If he was playing over Tristan Thompson, I think our small ball just runs him off the floor. What he would help with on offense the way he plays in that offense isn't nearly as useful as the points they'd give up from having him as a big on defense.  Irving, on the other hand, would have been a problem, if only for a secondary creator."
warriors,3d3imf,5thEagle,8,Mon Jul 13 08:22:40 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that Love was absolutely the wrong piece for a LeBron James team, and I don't understand why they signed him to a huge, long-term contract.  Why they're trying to stick a round peg in a square hole.  On a team where the PG is primary, Love could P&R, space the floor, be the 2ndary option near the post, rebound, get put-backs, etc.  Basically be himself.    But on the Cavs, LbJ (small forward) is primary.  Looking to create shots near the basket, then kick it back to 2ndary (Irving) or to the far corner, which is ... Love?  And if Love's job is to be the corner-3 guy when LbJ is being guarded, he's not going to get a lot of rebounds, nor is he going to get to spot guys up or get easy 2s.  If you put Love on the post and have LbJ pass it into him, then what is LeBron doing on offense ... becoming corner-3 guy?  LeBron sucks at that.  I just think that their best option to stop us was smothering defense mixed with high-percentage, low-post offense, like what the Grizzlies do.  Except they need better kick-out shooters than JR, Shump, and Della.   Irving definitely would have helped.  And we still beat them with Irving in Game 1."
warriors,3d3imf,togas73,2,Mon Jul 13 17:34:23 2015 UTC,Thompson and Delly were a better defensive matchup for us than Love and Irving would have been IMO.

He's right that with a healthy Irving and Love the series would've been different. I still think the Dubs would've prevailed but it would've been different.

warriors,3cyzjj,octiceps,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:22:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't necessarily say his shot was slower because  the defense was atrocious; there were shots that were heavily contested and he still had the same shot. He somewhat still uses the same motion but its much more fluid and faster.
warriors,3cyzjj,raiders4lyfe,2,Sun Jul 12 23:11:39 2015 UTC,"Idk, maybe his release was a little more mechanical looking this game for whatever reason but I feel like you're really splitting hairs here. I mean, here he is at Davidson with as quick of a trigger as I've ever seen: 1 2 3  And here is his 2010 vs. 2015 3-point contest. Stroke looks exactly the same to me.  FWIW, as far as footwork is concerned he does use the hop more often now which is a quicker release than the 1-2 step."
warriors,3cyzjj,octiceps,3,Mon Jul 13 00:42:07 2015 UTC,"The footwork I agree is different.   As for the shot motion, you do have to split hairs on, especially with a shooter like Curry. He's always been a shooter and little changes here and there, are monumental. He was more mechanical and he released the ball a little later than he does now. If you haven't seen it yet, they did a sports science segment on his release, which they measured the time of the release among other things. I'm not saying he had a slow release but you can tell the differences between when he first started in the league and now."
warriors,3cyzjj,raiders4lyfe,2,Mon Jul 13 03:53:16 2015 UTC,"Oh look, it's his ""old"" slower release. But wait, that shot was from earlier this year...  You see what I'm getting at? Curry's shooting form now is the same as it was in college is the same as it was in HS (Jr and Sr years after he remade his shot). As great of a shooter as Steph is, he's not a robot. And shooting in an NBA game doesn't happen in a vacuum--that's called practice. You're so focused on the shot-to-shot variations which can be due to any number of factors such as fatigue, balance, game situation (e.g. expiring shot clock or defending closing out), exaggerating certain motions to try to ""sell"" a foul, etc., that you're missing the overall picture."

They make an initial run and when those hit online they are gone, usually in 2 minutes.    My guess is that when they set up the factory months in advance so they could only make X amount of units without knowing for sure if Curry would be MVP and 2015 Champs.  And now months later it is too late to try to expand production now he is MVP and champion.   If the Warriors where beaten by the Grizzly's, or if Harden was the MVP, or if Kyrie was healthy and able to help Lebron to a win, maybe the demand for Curry One's would not be so crazy.  The shoe was really easy to get during the regular season back in Feb, but when the playoffs hit and Curry hit that Game 3 shot vs the Pelicans, the shoes were instantly hard to get for some reason."

The race being that bunched was very unusual.  4 teams were within 1 game of each other and a 5th team (Portland) was locked into the #4 seed. Adam Silver eliminated that rule, so FWIW, Spurs would have only fell to #5 in the current system. Over the past ten seasons, the number of wins to have the 4th best record in the West ranged from 49-56 wins. It would shock me if a healthy Warriors team lost that many more games."

I went to the pub with some buddies who wanted to catch a Raps vs Grizzlies game (we're in Ottawa) and i said what the hell, ill get high and tag along. I was pretty instantly hooked on the game. I could figure out what all the players were trying to accomplish and could see how they worked their plays.   a few weeks later and I'm watching the games at home on my own. after a Raps game, there was a later game on. Golden State vs i can't remember. But i watched them anyways. For the life of me i could not comprehend their plays. I thought, 'I saw them pass, and i saw the ball go in, but what the hell just happened?' The thing was, the opposing team would also look dumbfounded. I thought 'jeez, no team plays like these guys""  Next time i got together with my Raptor buddies i asked if they knew anything about GS, because they were just so solid. Right then, (early january) i said - they're gonna win it. they just will.   After watching the Championship game my girlfriend goes, ""i remember months ago at Joes you said 'golden state is going to win' and joe replied 'well that's a bold statement! 'Looks like you were right!"" she said.   I still love the Raps, and as a Canadian I clearly gravitate towards them, but GS is on another level that i can not help but admire. I dont feel guilty about it, I just think they are fantastic, and as a result have won me over as a fan."

The roster was put together in hopes of them developing into a championship team a year or two from now. With that said I think this team can still develop. We've seen what they are capable of when they play their best basketball and now the key is to do it some what consistently.
warriors,3cv69w,wordswordsyeah,2,Sat Jul 11 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"I hope you mean consistently over the years, because as far as the win record for last season I dont think you can ask for much more"

Bogut obviously wears down pretty easily and while Ezeli is promising, I don't think he's at the level of a starting NBA center yet. Our size will be an obvious weakness going into next season. I don't know if we can sustain small ball all season long."
warriors,3cuiuk,Cmdr_Nemo,4,Fri Jul 10 21:57:30 2015 UTC,"Been a STH for last 3 years---started in club200 year 1 and been in sec 109 last 2 seasons--renewed for fourth season.  Last year was by far the easiest to sell un-used tickets. We mainly sold AT COST to friends/family (it helped having a spreadsheet with games early in the season and a regular purchasing email list).   We also had success selling to other Warrior fans here on reddit.   With the hype, demand, etc I think it will be really easy for you to re-sell tickets (maybe even for a little gain).   That being said the tickets are not cheap and if you are working part time i'm not sure going in on 2 lower bowl tickets may be the smartest idea but thats up to you.   I definitely have been struggling with the idea of retaining my tickets (i mean now I have to since we won the chip lol---n STH renewal was also over 98% so there is a lot of demand to get in  Prices have gone up every year we have had tickets (partly bc we upgraded seats---but even if we had stayed)...we tend to pay a bit less than new STHs but we still are paying almost double from where we started (once again club 200 down to lower).   Seems like prices/cost etc will continue to rise so be prepared...also playoff tickets are not cheap...16 tickets for the playoffs cost us more than 43 games regular season + pre-season cost. BUT given the epic run we were able to pay off half of our next regular season ticket costs by selling various playoff games FOR PROFIT.   I also live in South San JOse so getting to and back from games can start to drag...thats why last year was wonderful...going to only about 15 regular season games and 4 playoff games was the right number.   Bottom line: if you get them I'm sure you will enjoy them and we for sure did not lose any money on any un-used tickets. If you are diligent with selling them in advance you will be fine. But once again prices will continue to rise faster than your income will so make sure you can afford to do this. (gone are the days when one could sit behind the backboard in the lower bowl for 20 bucks...sad to say)"

And you're probably right about lower bowl.  I saw season ticket prices for 2012-13 and I am pretty dang sure the prices will be at least 25% higher than what they were then.  If anything, I can go for the Lower Bowl behind the hoops.  Do you have ticket pricing by any chance for next season?  I can't find it!  As for playoff tickets, if we make it again, I plan to sell all but one game.  Too expensive for my tastes.  And if we can make a big run again, it'll definitely be profit!"

warriors,3cuiuk,lostfate2005,2,Sat Jul 11 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"Just a guess, but they're going to be a lot more than 25% higher than 12-13 - I'm in club 200, and my my prices went up 22% from 13-14 to 14-15, and they're going up another 21.5% for next year. So, for the same price tier, my seats have went up 55.5% since 12-13."

warriors,3cuiuk,thunder_piggy,2,Fri Jul 10 22:40:08 2015 UTC,"If you are a Warriors fan, and are care less about the Marquee matchups (Lebron, Clippers, etc.), then you can easily attend ~1/4 of the games (against lesser opponents) and break even or make a small profit.  Worst-case, you'll have profited off the games you sell, and will have attended each game very cheaply.  You can consider managing the extra tickets as a part-time job, where you earn about minimum wage, and the side benefit is free Warriors games.  Also, if they make a deep run in next year's playoffs and the cost of renewal is chief among your concerns, you can make a huge profit by selling all playoff games.    PSLs:  Last I heard about PSLs was from a Lacob interview in 2012 -- he said he didn't think they needed to go that route.  More recently Rick Welts said he wasn't sure... did you find out something else?"

My friend is offering to sell me two seats of four. We're going to the seat selection too!  Some additional questions:   How does seat selection work? Is it first come, first serve? I'm sure there will be people who want the lower bowl, so if there are x people vying for seats, what decides who gets them? When do payments start?

You guys won 67 games in the modern era, that not impressive at all.  It just mean the competition is weak.  That doesn't make the Warriors even remotely the 10 best team in history.

They are the Hawks of the east. Hence why people were comparing you guys to the Hawks. A above average team.   Wtf? Vegas had the Warriors as the odds on favorite to win it all for months. Making the championship was even shorter odds. Who are all these people you are talking about? Certainly wasn't the most efficient sports market in the world.

I like the way the Warriors matchup against the Thunder because Bogut can handle Ibaka.  I think that Draymond with help will do as well as anyone against KD.  I think that Klay + help from Bogut will do alright against Westbrook.  I don't like the way the Dubs matchup against the Spurs.  Aldridge + Duncan are going to be really difficult for Bogut/Draymond to deal with because they both use their height to great advantage in the post and that is going to be tough for Draymond.    I do like the way the Thunder match up with the Spurs.  Ibaka is a solid force in the middle and KD is tall enough and fast enough to make it tough on Aldridge/Duncan.  I think they can win the Ibaka/KD vs Duncan/Aldridge matchup."

Although we have won the championship and have been to 3 straight playoffs, this rise to excellence has been relatively recent.  Our only two-time all-star has only made it to that game twice these past two seasons.  The other teams have guys with multi-year all-stars.  Whatever though.  I get the perception, but I don't agree with it.  Does it bother me?  Naw.  When we were terrible, people talked shit, but I didn't care then either.  When we started this past season, everyone looked us over as well. Did that bother me?  naw.  If anything, I like the under-dog role.  Let them look past us and surprise them.

Because he speaks his mind he's always good for a highly quotable line, but all the other stuff he said in his press conference about Tom Izzo and his Mom shaping who he is as a person and basketball player and thanking the whole Warriors organization for all the things they do behind the scenes was very sincere. He talked for a while about his relationship with the fans and community (particularly Oakland and how it reminds him in many ways of Saginaw) and how important it is to him that he stays in Golden State. He also spoke about how he wanted to improve his game; become a more consistent shooter, work on his floater and post moves. Yet all we hear about after is his jokes about Kyrie's comments. It does Draymond a disservice when media people focus on his jokes, I think its a big reason why people think he's a jerk."

warriors,3cmqkt,chaoism,39,Fri Jul 10 09:52:31 2015 UTC,Deandre Jordan was the only player I sort of liked on that team.  They are complete evil now.  Chris Paul is the president of the players union...and they pull this shit. He represents the interests of the players and he continually does stupid shit that actually harms the interests/image of the players.

Now CP acts like they're brothers and pulling all this bromantic crap... what a two-faced shit.    Really curious to see how exactly Doc will find a better offensive role for DJ. How many of us actually believe CP will let DJ post up and kill the pace? I'm willing to bet that tensions will rise even more, if they didn't exist already."
warriors,3cmqkt,minusyourlife,2,Thu Jul 9 07:31:46 2015 UTC,"I don't get why anyone is offering DJ an expanded offensive role at all...maybe he has some skills he never shows? To me you can't run an offense through him, his offensive skillset seems more limited than Dwight's. Outside of PnR, what the hell else do you do? They have better options on both the Clippers and Mavs.   To me he is best suited as what he already was, get tip ins, offensive rebounds, lobs, PnR and if he has good position maybe dump it to him but other than that, I don't see how he should get ""more touches."""

Looking at other leagues off the top of my head id say the Cleveland Browns, San Jose Sharks and Seattle Mariners are all at or near the same level as the Clippers organization. Sure the Clips take the cake if you factor in the owners into the equation, but even in the NBA id say the Hornets/Bobcats/Hornets are about on the same level.    With that non-biased analysis out of the way, FUCK THE CLIPPERS!"
warriors,3cn9yq,circa_1,17,Thu Jul 9 05:52:12 2015 UTC,"Obviously, Dirk and Mark Cuban would have to agree that moving on is what's best for everyone.  If so, our team makes a hell of a lot of sense.  First, it not only fucks the Clippers, but the Rockets and Spurs, two teams that Mavs don't want to see win next year.  Second, with Dirk we can roll the most insane Small Ball line-up the league has ever seen.  We can go total offense with Green at the 5, then Dirk, Barnes, Klay, and Curry, or swap out Barnes for Iggy if we want some defense and pownage.  Third, Dirk doesn't have to play mad minutes.  He can rest if we go back to our 2015 starters, so he and Bogut could essentially trade floor time and neither be over-worked.  While I love P&R with Dirk/Curry, I think he'd also play well as a 6th man or in a line-up with Livingston and Barbosa.  Hell, I think he'd be great with just about any combo of our players.  We could mix and match and deal with just about any team in the league.  We traded away Lee, who was pretty much our only PF that could score with his back to the basket.  Adding Dirk adds that missing element to our team, and would make this squad even more flexible than last year's team.  Damn, now I really want to see this happen!"

Of course, he's a remarkable center and rare talent.  I don't think these ideas are as intangible as people make them out to be.  When guys like each other, feel like coaches are intelligent and fair, and trust the process they play harder.  Boogie is too immature for this team."
warriors,3cn9yq,wavetoyou,16,Fri Jul 10 16:32:00 2015 UTC,The Mavs (By the Mavs I mean Mark Cuban) have shown nothing but loyalty to Dirk. I don't think Cuban would ever trade him. Plus Cuban has too big of an ego to let his team tank.  I just couldn't see that happening. But I'd be the first to eat my words and welcome Dirk to the Bay.
warriors,3cn9yq,chaoism,10,Thu Jul 9 05:59:05 2015 UTC,"Agree with you. Seeing dirk leave is delusional, IMO. He's a Mav for life"
warriors,3cn9yq,BASKETBALLgod,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:58:27 2015 UTC,"No, it's not THAT delusional. Cuban might not want to watch Dirk waste away on a tanking team in potentially the final year of his HOF career...and Dirk might not want to either. Nowitzki didn't take a pay cut to play for a non-contender. This is THAT farfetched. Dirk leaves for one season to compete for a title, opts out only to return to DAL and retire as a Maverick...which is all that matters at the end of the day.  Tanking makes so much sense for DAL. Wes and Parsons can take their time coming back from injuries, and they can possibly keep their top 8 protected 2016 draft pick. Zaza Pachulia @ starting center isn't getting you a top 8 seed in the Western Conference. Unless they find the next Hassan Whiteside this summer...  Plus, think about this: what better way to get back at DJ and LAC then to give their biggest rival Dirk Nowitzki!? /r/JusticePorn   EDIT: Deron Williams to the Mavs rumors? Not quite a title-contending PG, but looks like Cuban's not throwing in the towel, yet..."
warriors,3cn9yq,BASKETBALLgod,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:00:17 2015 UTC,"I like the way you weave this, but I just don't see this happen. Dirk said he would want to be a mav for life, though it was about a year ago when he said this (and possibly again and again throughout the years) and things are changing, I just don't see how he would spend a year or two on another team. But that's just me. Anything can happen in this league. Nowadays verbal commitments don't mean shit already, who knows what else would happen"

warriors,3cn9yq,BASKETBALLgod,7,Thu Jul 9 06:04:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, but a Mav fan made a point that because of their loyalty, they might have a convo and determine its best for Dirk to go to a contender rather than tank for the remainder of his career/ retire."

warriors,3cn9yq,wavetoyou,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"Dirk has a no-trade clause anyway, so he couldn't be traded if he didn't want to be. However, after this fiasco, what if he does want to go to a contender for his last couple years? Cuban even said they would tank if missing on DJ, and now they have.  Maybe Wes Matthews and the Mavs could mutually decide to void his contract so he could to go to the Kings instead (slightly more $ for him anyway), Dirk allows himself to be traded to a contender to accelerate the Mavs' rebuild, and Carlisle leaves and goes somewhere else.  Nobody really gets screwed in this situation unless Dirk wants to stay with the Mavs no matter what (in which case the situation isn't even going to be discussed). [Parsons has a player option after next year, so even he only has to endure one season of tanking.] Were I Dirk, it's at least something I would consider."
warriors,3cn9yq,togas73,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:48:50 2015 UTC,Matthews ain't backin out because no one else can offer him that type of deal anymore. No one has space for it and would want him.
warriors,3cn9yq,nerdalerd,2,Thu Jul 9 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it will likely not happen. It depends on how much Dirk values winning another ring, but he would ideally like to retire a Mav. However, it makes sense from the Mavs perspective to trade him for assets. Maybe Wallace plus our 1st next year or Looney (if the would rather have him) for Dirk. It would really fuck over the Clips too, so maybe Cuban is mad enough to do it ."

However, I knew a time would come the Lee would be needed in the championship run.

warriors,3cp6bq,Maxdgr8,2,Thu Jul 9 20:01:16 2015 UTC,"I think the Warriors deserve the benefit of the doubt as being a feared opponent. They have proved in the postseason that they can beat whoever their opponent is. Whether it is the Spurs or Clippers, they would have adjusted and found a way to win. You are basing their old fear of the Clippers and Spurs on the regular season, which is different than the postseason. A one game stretch, where the postseason is all about adjustments.   Last season is over, get over it. This upcoming season is a whole other game. Who knows if the Clippers and Spurs new roster will work well together. They both could have become a worse team for all you know. But as of now, the Warriors are the BEST TEAM in the whole league. The Championship speaks for itself."

If Warriors actually were the best team in the NBA this year then I have no problem calling them champion but the truth is they aren't.  This is like when the Packer a wildcard team won the Superbowl.  That happen all the time in the NFL, where the best team don't win the Superbowl most of the time.  That should not happen in the NBA because of the playoff format and not do or die per game."

Not a damn one of us is scared of the Clippers.  We owned them last year.   Glenn and his band of idiots won't get past the 2nd round.  Again.  We smoked the entire West by 10 games last year and we were just goofing around most of the time.  And quit crying about the poor LeBrons.  We beat Irving.  Love is a joke.  Guy couldn't sniff the playoffs his entire career, didn't do a damn thing during the regular season, and suddenly he's playoff-jesus?  Go ride Skip Bayless's crotch."

Owning someone last year is not the same as owning them this year.  Clippers got the Truth and Stephenson, while the Warriors lost DL.    Warriors are lucky not to face the Clippers this year because things could have turn out different for them."

Embarrassed them.  Won our division with a month to go in the season, then coasted to a 11 game lead over them while half-heartedly playing things out after we'd clinched 1st throughout.  Fucking Clippers ...  we'd bitch-slap them worse than the Rockets if they hadn't choked.  4-0 sweep."

It no longer run and gun in the playoff and if it wasn't for injuries, not even sure if the Warriors could have even gotten past the Grizz for example.  And the Clippers beat the Grizz before in the playoff.    Curry, Green, Thompson, Iggy is not better than Griffin/Jordan/CP3.  I'm sorry they are not.  And now it Griffin/Jordan/CP3/Pierce and if Stephenson can get back to his Indiana days - god save the state, Golden State that is."

Once we figured them out, we made one simple adjustment, and it was OVER.  3 straight wins. Bring on the next one.  I laugh at your pathetic attempts to build up the freakin' Clippers.  We've beaten every single member of the NBA 1st team, and you think we're worried about two old guys the Clippers added?"

If it was say Hakeem, Kobe, Malone, and MJ, then that would be something but freaking Marc Gasol?  It just show you how crappy modern NBA is and how weak the competition really is.  You were not exceptional in the playoff, you faced every team that had injuries.  You should be and you'll will see too enough.  It was either Clippers or Warriors to win the championship last year.  The Clippers choke and you guys won.  You better pray the Clippers choke again this year because we might be able to get Josh Smith as well.    Westly, Smith, Aldrich, Stephenson, Dawson, Arthur, and Rivers is not a bad bench and can match up with GS."

We own the Clippers.

I also happen to remember that weak Rocket Team nearly won the first two games against the Warriors at home.  How soon you folks forget that.    Draymond Green is a scrub so who care if he there or not.  He doesn't scare me.  He a tweener and not a very good one either.  Barnes/Greene are both scrub and only make shot when they are wide.  However Livingston, Barbosa, Speight are a dangerous bench I""ll give you that.    However I have a feeling that Durant will Join the Clippers next year so like I said things aren't look good for the Warriors if they have to meet with the Clippers in the playoff and even if you beat us, it going to wore you guys down tremendously.

warriors,3chckf,KingShindo,29,Tue Jul 7 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Why would his image be destroyed forever?  Is Kevin Garnett's image destroyed forever for going to Boston?  Also, bringing Durant would free up Klay even more...cause he was pretty underwhelming at times in the finals when Shumpert was guarding him.  Furthermore, I love Barnes...but if you have the chance to get a top 3 talent...and pair him with Curry (who's arguably a top 5 talent)...u take that chance everyday."
warriors,3chckf,DeadhardyAQ,-4,Tue Jul 7 23:30:56 2015 UTC,"KG went to a team that won like 35 games the season prior. It's one thing to hop onto teams with super stats, it's another to hop onto a team that just won a championship.   The Cavs defended us in a way that it was okay for Draymond, Andre, HB, etc. to take shots. They gave them those looks sometimes. Their philosophy was to not allow the Splash Bros anything. If you rewatch it, we went on our best runs when Klay was in. Andre got easier lanes to the rim (rather than settling for those midrange shots that miraculously fell), and everything picked up. Now, having Klay Thompson as a 3rd option is insane. He'd be a great 1st on most good teams, and yes he'd get even cleaner looks to the rim, but players want to feel involved at the same time. Just signing a max and getting like half the looks he did prior may not sit well with him."

warriors,3cgr8r,b0b_hope,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:29:52 2015 UTC,"So we are going to be hit with the repeater tax next year whether or not we stretch him? If that's the case I would rather pay him now and have him off the books next year, then to owe him money next year when we have to pay our FAs."
warriors,3cgr8r,cali_daddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:57:46 2015 UTC,Nah we shouldn't be hit with the repeater tax. Cap is going to jump up when the new TV deal kicks in. That's why so many teams are spending big this FA. You'd have to commit a shit ton of salary to really be at the cap next year.
warriors,3cgr8r,muhrda,2,Wed Jul 8 03:36:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. It's basically what happened with Josh Smith, I think.  But Marc Spears says the Warriors will keep him. Guess they cant have enough of those 6'6""-6'8"" guys."
warriors,3cgr8r,Gladness2Sadness,2,Tue Jul 7 20:26:57 2015 UTC,"I think Spears means the dubs are keeping him for now, no further trade. I expect him to be stretched by the deadline and gone.  Good move for the dubs, didn't actually cost us anything to dump Lee's salary."

We could have added one of the kids that wipes up sweat and I still think we are winning more games than last year. Hopefully he gets motivated by a chance to get a ring. He's going to barely play.

warriors,3ccy87,wasdf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:58:13 2015 UTC,"Yup, you're totally right. I still hold my breath when I see the ball kicked out to him though. And he just keeps up on defense, so as he gets older and slower consistency from beyond the arc is going to be key to his effectiveness."

Why will that change this year?    SAS has older guys who are seeing more time off due to rest & injuries. How will that get any better next year?    GSW has hopefully turned the corner in staying healthy, but you never know. Kerr does a great job with minutes and I'm sure that will continue in the upcoming season."

warriors,3cbpew,2015NBAchampions,2,Mon Jul 6 18:40:54 2015 UTC,His market value right now is probably somewhere $8-12m

warriors,3cbpew,DesertHomebody,0,Mon Jul 6 19:47:02 2015 UTC,I see him at Shump value which was $10m. You think he's that much better than Shump?
warriors,3cbpew,swollencornholio,6,Mon Jul 6 20:03:26 2015 UTC,He'll probably get from $11-13m based on the market we've seen. I doubt he goes for lower unless his agent does a bad job.
warriors,3cbpew,poolnickv,4,Mon Jul 6 20:43:18 2015 UTC,Yea probably wishful thinking on my part.
warriors,3cbpew,swollencornholio,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:37:42 2015 UTC,That's a solid contract once the cap is at 100+m -> I would say we would have a solid piece at a solid price considering where the cap is going. 2017-2018 will be the crazy year.
warriors,3cbpew,poolnickv,4,Mon Jul 6 22:00:48 2015 UTC,Barnes is better than Shump. I don't think theres much debate on this.
warriors,3cbpew,WhenItsHalfPastFive,3,Tue Jul 7 00:29:04 2015 UTC,"Barnes has slightly higher stats than Shumpert when it comes to career 3PT%, FT%, PPG, RPG, and others. He's also a couple years younger which doesn't hurt. So I could see the argument for paying him more than $10mil."
warriors,3cbpew,woodelf,4,Mon Jul 6 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"Bigger and more versatile defender too. Remember that Kerr and Myers cnostantly say that the small lineup is hinged upon Barnes being 6'8-6'9 and able to be at the center while playing a wing type role on offense.  Shumpert is 6'5 at best, hard to say with that hair."

warriors,3cbpew,poolnickv,0,Tue Jul 7 04:13:05 2015 UTC,"You comment a lot. I see you are a true fan. But I'm sorry for educating you on how free agency works. Did the Blazers get anything for LMA? Next year many top prospects will finish their contract. Now, each team that holds said contract can trade them mid season, with hopes of something better coming their way. Thunder could trade KD before season ends, they could get each teams next every other first round pics for the next six years (can't trade two #1s in a row)... But if they don't... ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS OFFER THEM MONEY THAT WE WILL HAVE."
warriors,3cbpew,MetalTear,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:51:35 2015 UTC,"Calm down. You should first see that we will not have space for a max contract next year.  Basketball-reference is a good source for this information. Do the math and then you can start educating me.  Consequently we will have to free up space if a max contract is what they want to do for an offer. And that will be done through a trade.     The only big fish who get traded are those that indicate they will not be returning. Otherwise players like LMA, DJ would have been traded before they left. I surmise that the Thunder won't be trading KD as he has not led them to think that."
warriors,3cbpew,poolnickv,-1,Tue Jul 7 08:35:03 2015 UTC,"Well since you asked for it, here we go. With the new resigning and David Lee we are currently at 81,795,705. Over the cap and have to pay some tax... Boo hoo. You referenced basketball reference... They still haven't updated our current situation. But please Google that shit. According to them we have 56.7m on the books next year. 2017 only 17.8m because of Klay contract. Obviously there is more. Cap is going to 89m in 2016 and up to 108m 2017 and beyond. Yes we do have the money to pay Curry huge and add another elite. Many people are coming off the books. We don't have to trade anyone, just sit back and relax. We have the perfect storm happening right now. I don't know if you feel educated or not. But please feel free to show facts that I'm wrong."

I read through a series of back and forths, and eventually came across it. Look, Twitter is a public forum, not some private conversation. If you go around calling people ""gay ass fans"" then you're a moron. I mistakenly use the term ""gay"" to refer to things in a negative connotation once in a while when chatting with friends, as it just sort of slips out (bad habit that i've done well to correct), but I have no patience or understanding for those who actually type it out and think, ""perfect!""  This kid is a moron, plain and simple. Also continuously used the term ""molest,"" as well. Once again, something that I've used in jest to be comical, but not something I'd actually repeatedly type in this or any public medium. He's a simpleton. Nothing about the ""uneducated"" (Amico shoutout) Tweets he spewed seem ""okay i guess."" The ignorance he displays on basketball-related opinions, alone, would keep me away...no point.

I just don't limit what a say, and i never have. If you think im gonna sit here and buy into to what other people say and just follow along like a brain dead sheep, you are 100% wrong.

warriors,3c75pz,pilatesfreak89,-1,Sun Jul 5 18:49:22 2015 UTC,"name me 10 players better than Kawhi - IMO theres Curry, Lebron, Durant, A. Davis, CP3, Harden, Russell Westbrook, Demarcus Cousins, Blake Griffin. That's 9 - name me another player you'd rather have...  As for the Tony Parker comment yeah thats absurd - Patty Mills was actually the better Spurs PG during the playoffs."
warriors,3c75pz,bqnguyen,4,Sun Jul 5 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"LMA, Lillard, Kevin Love, Kyrie, Paul George are all above Kawhi right now (Kawhi has a lot of potential to be better than some of these guys in the future).   Possibly better than Kawhi if healthy: Carmelo, DWade, Bosh, Dwight, etc.   Kawhi is a really good player that has a lot of potential to be top 10, but he isn't quite there yet."
warriors,3c75pz,pilatesfreak89,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"None of those guys are as good as Kawhi (I'm not talking about in the past I'm talking about heading into the coming season). The fact that you are even mentioning Carmelo and DWade at this point makes me doubt how much basketball you watch. If anyone deserves to challenge Kawhi for the 10th spot it might be Marc Gasol, but again I stand by my list."
warriors,3c75pz,bqnguyen,4,Sun Jul 5 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"Oh I didnt mention Marc Gasol because I already assumed he was in your list. I said Carmelo and DWade could POSSIBLY be better than Kawhi if they were healthy. Otherwise I would've included them in the other list along with PG.   LMA and Kevin Love are top 3 players in their position. Kyrie is an excellent ball handler, shooter, and perimeter defender. PG is in the same league as Anthony Davis. Lillard is questionable, but I think he's a pretty good poor-mans Curry (excellent shooter, ball handler, slightly struggling on D). Kawhi is a REALLY GOOD role player (athletic 3&D) and can really improve his game if not injured, but he's not a top 10 player yet. Maybe 15, but not 10.  As for Carmelo, DWade, Dwight, etc: They were all dominant at their position just a couple years ago and only stopped because of injury. If healthy, they have a CHANCE (not saying they're better, but only that they can be) to be better than Kawhi."
warriors,3c75pz,pilatesfreak89,-1,Sun Jul 5 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree with a bunch of things you're saying - Aldridge and Kevin Love are probably the 3rd and 4th best PF's in the league, behind AD and Blake Griffin. Calling Kyrie a good perimeter defender is just absurd - he's been awful defensively his entire career (although he did do a nice job on Curry in gm. 1 of the finals). Saying that Paul George is in the same league as Anthony Davis is actually fucking retarded and I'm not even sure what you're saying - they play different positions and Anthony Davis is much, much better. Lillard is overrated and might be the worst defensive PG in the league (comparing him to Curry is strnage as he does nothing as well as Curry (shooting, distributing, creating his own shot, defense). Carmelo and D Wade are two of the most inefficient players in the league, and neither play even average defense at this point in their careers."
warriors,3c75pz,bqnguyen,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:34:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry my mistake again. I meant to say 3rd and 4th for LMA/Love. Kyrie is actually a much better defender than he's given credit for. PG IS as good as AD right now, but AD has potential to be as good as LeBron or KD in the future. Paul George basically carried the Pacers to success 2 seasons ago, and before injury was one of the best players in the league. Lillard has similar, but weaker game than Curry. That's why I called him a poor-mans Curry.   And as I said before, Carmelo and DWade aren't better than Kawhi right now, but I think they CAN be. They don't have much time to do that though, as both are getting fairly old. IF they have a comeback season, it'll likely be in the next 2 years."
warriors,3c75pz,pilatesfreak89,0,Sun Jul 5 22:53:00 2015 UTC,The fact that you are insisting that Paul George is as valuable/good a player as Anthony Davis I think says a lot. RE: the original arguement - I don't think you could find a GM in the league that would want any of the guys you are talking about over Kawhi if they were starting a team. Kevin Love? Lamarcus Aldridge? Kyrie? none of these guys except Aldridge are even average defenders at their positions. Are they excellent players? Of course. Not as good as Kawhi IMO.
warriors,3c75pz,bqnguyen,0,Mon Jul 6 01:41:51 2015 UTC,"We can agree to disagree. Paul George is as good as AD imo. Again, I agree that AD is still developing and PG already hit his best, but for RIGHT NOW I think they're in the same tier. As for everyone else, I still think they're better than Kawhi for the reasons listed, but you haven't explained why you think Kawhi is better. He's an elite, athletic defender that can shoot open 3s. Until he develops a more dominant offensive game, I don't think he's as good as those other players. Insulting my basketball knowledge doesn't prove you right. Back it up with facts, stats, details."

warriors,3c75pz,jtmoneybags,7,Sun Jul 5 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"OKC, assuming they are healthy like Chuck said, are definately contenders for the West and the title. Enes Kanter, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka give them a ton of inside and outside scoring. They have Anthony Morrow off the bench hitting threes, Steven Adams with the good defense/rebounding/rim protection (when healthy), Collison with the good defense (also hurt last year), D.J. Augustin is a good backup PG just not a fantastic scorer. Waiters and Roberson are decent SGs but overall a very good team if everyone is healthy.  I wouldn't count them out in a seven game series against the Spurs or the Dubs. We'll just have to see how the season shakes out."

Warriors FO drafted draymond, harrison, steph, klay, got dre and bogut, traded away monta against public approval, got shaun, leandro, and speights. They fired mark jackson, and hired steve kerr.  I mean what they've done in the past few years is beyond amazing. This team was built by the FO, and I'd say it's better than what the spurs are doing as of right now.

As far as I'm concerned, anyone that brings up the injuries to other teams (and our lack thereof) or the fact that we didn't get to play against either LAC or SAS in the postseason is just in denial. The only reason why the Finals went to 6 games is because we had never faced a team before, postseason or regular season, whose offense was completely centered on Lebron ISOs which allowed him to dictate the pace.

Decided to look quickly at the Texas Tax structure and it's regressive - meaning that everyone pays the same tax despite their income. So they make a lot of their revenue from sales tax (high) and property tax (very high). So poor people end up spending about 12% of their income on tax and rich only about 3% because the same product will have let's say $1000 tax on it, which will be a higher percentage of a poor persons income than a wealthy person. Doesn't sound like no income tax is all fun/games."

He can do some things,  but it was surprising how bad he was some of those playoff games. Also, don't worry. We've added a pretty good free agent in our own, and its name is experience. Steve kerr comes in and starts implementing offense for the first time in most of these player's young careers, and we managed to win a championship in just a year under him. Sure we had some chemistry,  but things change when movement starts. Harrison,  draymond,  klay,  and festus all have lots of room for improvement. Especially HB.

We've had the weapons to take them down for years now, but have always seemed awestruck by them because of their rep and their precision.  They know how to play good basketball.

I'm thinking his salary's in line with so many others we can either move him with the expectation that we actually get something in return or we just keep him and take the tax hit like seemingly everyone else is doing.

And everyone else is getting better too. Who may fall off? Bogut possibly, but I'm high on Festus next year. Even if Bogut goes down for 15 games, if we have Festus I'm not scurred.

Years later she is confused about who to root for, but said she was gonna root for the Clippers if they go against GSW, but roots for GSW if Clippers are out. But now I get to rib her stupid Clippers."
warriors,3c12pq,rtdzign,3,Sat Jul 4 16:59:34 2015 UTC,"Aw c'mon now. I grew up in the Bay and moved to LA 4 years ago for law school. Never left the Dubs! When I first moved here I got so much shit for being a warriors fan and ha, how times have changed! I remember people absolutely laughing at me when I said the Dubs could make a run for the 8th seed before the 2012-13 season and we finished 6th ha. I also remember arguing with my friend that Curry was really good (before he had his break out season) and they were like nahhhh he's not that good haha.   I remember someone posted here about why are Lakers rooting for warriors. I can say that is somewhat true. Some will always hate cuz the the LA-Bay rivalry but I had a lot of friends who were happy for me over this last season. It's mostly cuz the clippers - clippers fans are either 1) lakers haters (trend to not like the Lakers when they dominated the league I guess kinda like ""anti-society"") 2) bandwagon fans who left the Lakers. So some of them would rather see the Dubs do well mostly like - where do they play? Oh yeah that team my norcal friend from college would get laughed at when they said they were a fan. A lot of them are also more likely to know how much we suffered from irrelevancy and how loyal our fan base was despite it. So they know we deserve success way more than a team like the clippers.    I went to clippers-warriors games at Staples here to watch some Dubs and that's when I started hating the Clippers because the games were so fucking crackin. I remember yelling, ""where were you guys 5 years ago when the clippers sucked?!!"" Even got a couple of fans to admit they used to be Lakers fans hahhaha."

I just remember thinking ""yea I can see Lakers are doing well (this was 2010 when I graduated and move back to Bay Area) but I am not gonna bandwagon so I started rooting for Dubs as that's our Bay Area team."" At the time, Lin signing with the Dubs also made it even easier to root for the Dubs and look where we are now!  I would say from 2010 on, Lakers fans were always cocky while Clips fans are cocky more recently."

That right there has enough of a novelty worth it to some folks to go out and purchase it, it's also why it's in such high-demand at the moment.

Lebron has some pretty glaring weaknesses that seem to get overlooked and anytime he makes a normal play it's made out to be some amazing feat so now I get to watch that dude shoulder and elbow his way to the GOAT.  I'm not saying he isn't good and I understand that it sounds petty but I'm sick of hearing about it. Plus he's a fucking diva and it bugs the shit out of me."

I ask because every good team has that guy that gets under the other team's skin.  The Kevin Garnett's, the Ron Artest's, the Draymond Green's, I actually think that is almost an essential piece to a championship team, the ability to get into the other team's head.  Bowen filled that role for the Spurs for so many years, but his intent to injure, in my mind, sets him apart from others and prevents me from respecting him in the way that I imagine a Spurs fan such as yourself might dislike Draymond, but still respect him.  Curious to see if I'm just hometown biased or if deep down inside, Spurs fans understand what I'm saying"

warriors,3bxfdh,LandanRoss98,2,Sat Jul 4 02:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think curry could benefit  just from learning to drive the lane and draw contact when his shot isn't falling, rather than keep shooting. Him shooting like 3 FTs a game isn't a great strategy for someone who shoots them like he does"
warriors,3bxfdh,MetalTear,3,Fri Jul 3 14:27:02 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree. Yes he needs to get to the line more. But not at the cost of his health. Slashing point guards careers are always shortened by taking it hard to the hole and taking hard fouls. I'd like to see Harry B grow a pair and be our slasher. Once in the bonus, have Curry get more aggressive with ball. Reach in fouls that still get him to the line, but not bang his body"
warriors,3bxfdh,LandanRoss98,2,Fri Jul 3 21:26:20 2015 UTC,"To add to that, Dray needs to work on his slashing to the bucket. he's got the toughness to draw some hard fouls, but him driving to the bucket is very hit or miss, and I think if he converted more, he could draw more contact. You're completely right though, HB is a very good driver, but for some reason he doesn't do it too much"
warriors,3bxfdh,MetalTear,2,Fri Jul 3 23:05:59 2015 UTC,I con-Kerr. Hopefully Dray takes a huge step with HB. Dray adds muscle in off season and improves his vertical (i remember at least three bricked dunks last year). And our frustration with HB not dunking on everyone is why Rabsho is pissed. We saw him win games for us as a rookie in playoffs against the Spurs. If Curry didn't twist his ankle I truly believe we would have beat them. But that is the past. We are not a fluke. We will be better next year. And I can't wait to rub it in r/nba face

With Draymond's roughly comparable RFAs Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler at 5/90 and 5/95, respectively, 5/85 doesn't look so bad for a very close runner-up in DPOY for his 1-5 abilities, not to mention the ball handling, passing, and pick-n-pop game Draymond brings."

warriors,3btwhb,KobraCola,3,Thu Jul 2 03:52:17 2015 UTC,"It's not the max. Per:   The maximum, by rule, the Warriors couldâve given Green was $93.1 million over five years.  The maximum another team couldâve offered him was $69.2 million over four.   It's not directly halfway in between, but it's decently in between, with Dray coming out a bit better than the midpoint. However, I think this deal will look like a steal when the luxury tax threshold goes up to $127 mil in 2017-2018."

warriors,3btwhb,pilatesfreak89,6,Thu Jul 2 03:38:45 2015 UTC,a steal? he's getting exactly what he deserves IMO. a good deal for both Draymond and the team.
warriors,3btwhb,yupDIARRHEA,7,Thu Jul 2 03:42:49 2015 UTC,"It's under the max, BEFORE the cap goes up, which is already a plus, AND it's a long term deal, meaning the Dubs won't have to renegotiate when the cap is 100mil for a while.   He was arguably the second most important player on the team (Only he and Steph were +1000 for the season, the only two players to accomplish that ever), and a young player who was the second best defensive player last season in addition to being a good passer and despite not being the most efficient scorer is athletic and versatile enough to fit the offensive scheme, not to mention the emotional presence."

warriors,3btwhb,sum1rand0m,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:28:42 2015 UTC,I like that they resigned him but I don't think he is worth that much.
warriors,3btwhb,FUCK_THE_r-NBA_MODS,18,Thu Jul 2 03:02:46 2015 UTC,"He's one of the top defenders in the NBA and he just entered the NBA not long ago. We'll have Curry, Klay, and Dray locked in for years to come and if we can keep drafting well and making the right moves in FA for role players, this gets to continue on. So I think he's worth it."
warriors,3btwhb,sum1rand0m,2,Thu Jul 2 03:08:01 2015 UTC,"Nah I get it, he is a good player and still glad we got him. But the fact that he is making more than the Splash bros is ridiculous. As long as he continues to get better and it doesn't let this get to his head then I am okay with the signing."
warriors,3btwhb,KobraCola,8,Thu Jul 2 03:25:28 2015 UTC,He deserves to make more than Klay due to the fact that he is a better player.
warriors,3btwhb,Jonnydanger,2,Thu Jul 2 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"That's only because we smartly signed Steph and Klay at optimal times for the team. They'll get theirs $-wise and continue to do so the better they perform. As for the dollar amount for Dray, this will look like a steal once the 2017-2018 salary cap increase kicks in IMO."
warriors,3btwhb,zodiacs,-1,Thu Jul 2 08:22:20 2015 UTC,The thing with Dray is the he is certainly playing at his absolute ceiling right now. The fact that he is an undersized defensive player means that if he loses even a little bit of speed his value diminishes greatly. I'd argue that his current level of play isn't sustainable for very long unless he really learns to be a better offensive player.
warriors,3btwhb,KobraCola,6,Thu Jul 2 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"He can improve his 3 point shot, finishing at the rim, developing a jump shot. There are many ways he can improve and I'm sure he will."
warriors,3btwhb,Amcog,3,Thu Jul 2 03:34:12 2015 UTC,"He's only 25 though. Statistically speaking, most players begin their peak around age 27 and it lasts until about age 30/31. He could become a much more refined offensive player as he gets older. The best is yet to come with Dray, it would seem."
warriors,3btwhb,sum1rand0m,9,Thu Jul 2 08:21:19 2015 UTC,"17 mil is pretty good, especially if you factor in the jump in the cap in a few years time. Warriors are committed to this core, so it's worth the price."
warriors,3btwhb,Amcog,0,Thu Jul 2 03:10:15 2015 UTC,"True, but on paper him making more then the Splash bros is ridiculous. As long as he continues to get better like he has been each year, then I am okay with it. But he is the one Warrior I can see that a signing like this can get to his head."
warriors,3btwhb,ScreamingIntrovert,5,Thu Jul 2 03:28:13 2015 UTC,"The only reason he's making more then Curry is because the Warriors re-signed him when he had the nagging ankle injury. He is the worst paid superstar I've ever seen, but he'll almost certainly get a true max deal in two years time.   Draymond has earnt this contract; he's one of the best and most versatile defender in the league and that's worth a lot the way the game is played. There's few in the league that can do what he does, and I think it was sensible for the Warriors to retain him, even at the price point."
warriors,3btwhb,Amcog,3,Thu Jul 2 03:46:33 2015 UTC,"I think Steph's a little more grounded than Dray. If it comes to taking a discount to keep the core together for more years, he'll probably take the cut. But the new TV deal and the increase in cap will really help the dubs keep everyone together for a good five years."
warriors,3btwhb,ScreamingIntrovert,3,Thu Jul 2 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Steph might be willing to structure his contract around the team's needs, but at the end of the day he needs to take care of himself and his family long term, as it'd probably be his last long contract. And the Warriors as an organization really owe it to him to do so. Most people never mention how lucky the team is that one of the league's best player is paid so little, and has never made a fuss over it."
warriors,3btwhb,Amcog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:43:45 2015 UTC,"I still think he's going to become a big NBA icon in the future. In a league led by physically dominant superstars, he shows them all up with his amazing IQ, handles, and ability to score from anywhere. By the end of it all, he'll be making money off royalties and endorsements like how MJ, Kobe, and LeBron are making their money. Under Armour is going to be paying him millions when he retires from basketball the same way MJ is getting Nike money from his Jordans. He's like the people's player. All the bigger, badder players are monster athletes. Curry on the other hand looks like an average dude, acts like an average dude, humble and relatable, only he's really good at basketball. His merchandise will continue to sell especially when the Dubs win more championships and money won't be a problem in the future. He's already the poster child of the NBA right now. He's got the face and the personality for the media and he's very likable and relatable. But I still think he should get the max if it doesn't hurt the core too much. He deserves it."
warriors,3btwhb,ScreamingIntrovert,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:53:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah potentially. I mean, at the moment Under Armour last I checked was paying him $5 million, a steal for an MVP and champion. Hopefully it's something where it hikes up the more accolades he wins, and I bet Nike are regretting not matching UA's offer.   Also, I don't see anyone besides Jordan really having such a massive brand (though I don't live in the U.S., so maybe it's different there). Yeah, their jerseys sell well, but I don't see Kobe or Lebron having such a big impact after they're finished with the game. Jordan is almost synonymous with the NBA internationally.  He was the first international athlete I ever followed. Now Lebron and Kobe are just treading the beaten path, and while they're insanely successful, I don't see anyone matching what Jordan has."
warriors,3btwhb,Amcog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"That's true. I guess I over exaggerated Curry's success. But I think he can live off a pay cut contract if he needed to with the money he gets from endorsements. I don't know how much he's making off them, but he does have UA and Statefarm, plus potentially more to come in the future. He's very grounded for a superstar because he grew up within the NBA and his dad wasn't a big shot superstar. You won't find Curry living the life of a millionaire like Magic or Jordan, and I would probably compare him to Bird being said that Curry would rather spend money buying a decent sized house for his parents and his own family living away from the spotlight. The only time we'll see him on the media is through his wife's snapchats and instagram updates. When I read about Curry, or see anything from his past, it's pretty clear that money isn't something that motivates him. He's comfortable with what he has and if required to, he would more than likely play the Tim Duncan role in the Dubs to keep the core together for years to come. He's very humble and is motivated by the game more than the fame or fortune that comes with being a superstar. But that's just how I see him."
warriors,3btwhb,TazMahol,2,Fri Jul 3 04:17:22 2015 UTC,"I share your interpretation of him, and I imagine he is pretty fiscally responsible, what with being a family oriented king of guy. I just want to see talent get paid and not get screwed, the way Pippen did with the Bulls. The league and owners makes so much money off the talent and personalities of their players, it'd be nice to see Curry be rewarded for what he's doing for the team. Though I guess championships are also a reward in themselves."
warriors,3btwhb,iWesTCoastiN,3,Fri Jul 3 05:28:09 2015 UTC,Earnt
warriors,3btwhb,wavetoyou,5,Thu Jul 2 04:44:29 2015 UTC,He only made more than Steph because we got Steph on a huge discount. Klay got his max and this sets us up perfectly for the increase in cap space with the new NBA TV deal.
warriors,3btwhb,pezcone,6,Thu Jul 2 03:35:48 2015 UTC,"Klay's deal averages out to $17.5M per year, but is backloaded. He's making $15.5M next season, but ~$19M in the final year of the current deal. Green will likely be making a little less, per year.  Green's deal seems to be averaging just under $17M per year, but will likely also be backloaded. So, he'll come in @ right around $15M. Nothing's been set in stone, but I assume this is how it's going to happen.  Meanwhile, like others have said...Curry was ecstatic with the 4 year $44M contract at the time. Pundits even saying the Warriors were making a 'classic Warriors' mistake by giving him so much because of ankle woes, while someone like Ty Lawson was making only $1M more per year. He'll cash in at 28-29, while in his prime."
warriors,3btwhb,Zlasher,4,Thu Jul 2 04:06:09 2015 UTC,He's the second best player on the team. Look beyond ppg
warriors,3btwhb,Rogue_Toaster,0,Thu Jul 2 03:17:28 2015 UTC,"Damn, no discount at all rofl. It's even a hair more AAV than if he got a full max from another team. So it sounds like the Warriors FO was scared of any potential 2 year with 3rd year player option of 3 year with 4th year player option deal, that would have forced the Warriors to match and have to pay even more money in his next, URFA contract."
warriors,3btwhb,Zlasher,15,Thu Jul 2 03:02:42 2015 UTC,"Max for us was 93m. Max elsewhere was 69m. Solid deal, actually cheaper per year than matching  EDIT: Its 5 years 82, even better!"
warriors,3btwhb,Rabsho,4,Thu Jul 2 03:06:39 2015 UTC,"I thought the max elsewhere was like 4/67 not 4/69, which was a 16.75 AAV? Guess I was wrong. But whatever, hardly makes a difference. I'm glad we just got him without having to match some 2/3 year deal with a player option 3rd/4th year"
warriors,3btwhb,Zlasher,4,Thu Jul 2 03:24:46 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter. We have our core locked up for a reasonable amount. We'll be contending for years and years to come.
warriors,3btwhb,wavetoyou,4,Thu Jul 2 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"I mean it doesn't matter at all obviously, he's worth any amount we paid him. This is definitely good news lol, just was hoping for like 5/80 or 5/75 but it doesnt matter."
warriors,3btwhb,5thEagle,3,Thu Jul 2 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, just gotta re-up Barnes next summer for 4 years $50M, and we're good to go."
warriors,3btwhb,KobraCola,-1,Thu Jul 2 04:02:35 2015 UTC,"Little more than I was hoping for, but realistically we were looking at at least $16 mil per. Deal's done at least, and it's nice and long.  Still a bit sour that his play this year took him from what probably would have been like an $8 mil per contract to 16 mil, but hard to complain when we just got a championship out of it."
warriors,3btwhb,5thEagle,3,Thu Jul 2 05:28:56 2015 UTC,"I think it'll look much better in a few years. I mean, the 2017-2018 luxury tax threshold is projected to be at $127 mil. ~$17 mil for Dray then doesn't seem bad at all, haha."

We make 2 back-to-back NFC title games, fresh off a close loss in the super bowl...and everyone thought that with a young QB and defense, we'd be a hot ticket for free agents.

warriors,3bus4c,jtmoneybags,2,Thu Jul 2 13:01:08 2015 UTC,I think the warriors FO is going to be able to trade David Lee to someone and not have to package someone with him to dump his contract. Next year he is scheduled to make $15.5m and it's a one year contract at that point. Some team will take him off our hands that needs inside scoring and rebounding with the cap increasing next season.
warriors,3bus4c,ScreamingIntrovert,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:16:47 2015 UTC,Everyone's getting paid so much Lee's $15 Mil doesn't look that much now with the contracts that have been signed over the past couple of days.

warriors,3bvzjf,warriorswriter,2,Thu Jul 2 16:33:40 2015 UTC,How did you calculate the luxury tax if Lee was trade and no new salary was taken?  I have it as $99.8M - $15.5M(Lee's Salary) = $84.3M. So with the Luxury tax line at $81.6M wouldn't the amount over the cap only be $2.7M? It would still be in the first tier however the tax amount would be $4.05M. Is there something I'm missing here?
warriors,3bvzjf,cali_daddy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thanks for that!   I accidentally added the incremental amount in my calculations. The correct savings would be $15.5M + $35.1M.   Which is insane."

warriors,3bwdcm,sinith1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:32:37 2015 UTC,"He did wear a Knicks jersery before he wore ours, but luckily we rescued him from that he'll."
warriors,3bwdcm,StartAndSelect,6,Fri Jul 3 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Warriors will need to add anyone to sweeten the deal. Bottom line, the two teams interested in David Lee have all but completely struck out with free agent targets. Lee's $15.4M salary is actually looking somewhat affordable these days, and he'd be a great addition to both teams, on and off the court.   The Knicks would be foolish not to bring Lee back for a bit of a reunion tour, if and when they are unable to attract anyone else. It will be the silver lining to an inevitably crappy season, and I think having Lee around someone like Porzingis would be beneficial to his future. As for the Lakers...I'd rather not see Lee in purple and gold, but they could definitely use his double-double acumen. And, of course a future 2nd round pick would be the icing on the cake. Maybe they can find a future Gilbert Arenas/Monta Ellis/Draymond Green of their own? Also, let's not forget that Lee can still easily average a double-double given suitable minutes. Hell, if he relocates his midrange game, Lee can be a legitimate 2nd tier threat.  It's no surprise that David West has expressed his desire to join a contender, after opting out of a guaranteed $12.2M with the Pacers (holy crap). The Warriors and the Spurs are the two teams being mentioned. It's obvious that San Antonio will be even more elite if they're able to land LMA, but even if they do not, with Splitter and Banes gone, there's plenty of room for West to succeed there. But, for the sake of wanting him all to ourselves, let's focus on a deal that will bring West out West:  David Lee ($15.4M) + future draft pick <> David West  The Lakers/Knicks would perform a sign and trade with David West. He's turning 35 in August, and yet West's contract will have to be multi-year (job security), likely 2 years $12M-$14M, with his first year salary remaining ~$6M. West will bring the Warriors a terrific veteran presence, toughness/strength/size, strong offensive abilities that include back to the basket/midrange/passing, and a certain no-nonsense reputation. This wouldn't be the first time a former Pacer comes to our organization and adds some always necessary grit...give Draymond some ""backup.""  Dumping $9.4M in salary will be the difference between GSW paying $3.50 or $1.75 on every dollar over the tax apron. In other words, tens of millions of dollars in taxes will be avoided on top of the salary saved. This is the main reason I think if a deal like this is on the table, the Warriors would be [dare I say] foolish to pass it up. BTW, I totally rambled on, and am not proof-reading...good luck to those who dare read it."
warriors,3bwdcm,wavetoyou,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:44:53 2015 UTC,If they can dump Lee to one of these teams why would they try to add west? Wouldn't they be under the cap if they traded Lee and added no one?
warriors,3bwdcm,hummus6669,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:49:36 2015 UTC,"I think they'll be right on the cusp, but likely just over the tax line. Projected tax line for next season is ~$82M. Keep in mind, however, that taxes will be calculated on the team's salary at the end of the season. Therefore, we could essentially hold on to Lee until February, and try again before the deadline, if no one wants him. Of course, he doesn't want to stay, because his role is substantially diminished with this team.  The first, and best, option would be to unload Lee's salary and gain nothing in return. This was more of a scenario if that doesn't prove possible. Also, if the Warriors decide to sign Barbosa for the minimum, that'll 100% put them into the tax even if we completely dump Lee's salary."
warriors,3bwdcm,wavetoyou,3,Fri Jul 3 06:53:23 2015 UTC,"a team like the lakers/knicks might take him for free at this point. They have cap space and no assets -- and there's a chance lee turns into someone you can flip at the trade deadline. It's not a high percentage play, but what else are you going to do with that money? LMA/Monroe aren't taking it."
warriors,3bwdcm,raorao,2,Thu Jul 2 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"I'd thought they would surrender a draft pick to sweeten the pot, but at this point, it has to be one of the low cost wings or a prospect. Given the gap between our playing prospects (Festus) and non playing (JMM/Kuz), you have to think a team would want someone like LB/HB/SL to balance out the deal.  There is also the chance we hand over a bit of cash outright with the deal."

This is like Klay's contract in a way.  The problem is the timing if we're talking about him getting paid and not the team saving money.  From his POV if we want to see him rich as possible it'd be great if he could sign a one year for 5-10 while Lee is still here and then re sign him the year after this when we aren't paying 15.5 mil to his backup.  This is where I wish NBA had a franchise tag of some sort to give him a good amount of money this year but then make it rain long term for him next year when Lee leaves and the cap gets bigger.  He deserves more than his 15 million max.  When the new cap numbers come in after this year he'll be worth every penny of 20 million (triple double in game winning finals is just ONE of his many qualifications to 20 mil).  But if he signs THIS YEAR for anything more than one year he'll miss out. :-(  And since we don't know exactly what the new cap will be the NBA won't let us give him 20 million in 16-17 even if we wanted to (which I do cause he's the perfect compliment to Steph).  We're just going to need to realize that keeping Klay, Dray and Steph is going to be HARD to do while keeping guys like Igoudala, Barnes and Bogut (also if he plays well this year and is putting up double digit PPGs don't sleep on Ezeli wanting even 10 million after the cap increases, either, depending on how the C position goes for us next year).  Not impossible but it will take some work.  Some of these guys IMO are going to NEED to take less if they all want to stay together.  Like you I won't blame them for choosing money over team (especially since they already won their championship here), but I think there will be a lot of choices made between GMs and players alike.  Fun Fact: Curry's contract comes up going into his ninth year as a player, meaning he will still only be in the second tier of max contracts and ineligible for the real max (Lebron style) contract.  For simplicity's sake if the cap stayed the same the next two years Steph would only be eligible for around 19 million next contract.  However if his deal had been one year longer than it is/was he'd be in the 10 year range and could make the Lebron/Kobe bucks.   Myers is a goddamn genius."

warriors,3bsbz2,SeriousNewsOnly,3,Thu Jul 2 02:56:33 2015 UTC,"I think the Warriors actually have more flexibility now, if they can move Lee before they have to match an offer to Dray, they might be able to get under the cap and sign another FA before they go back over matching on Dray.  I am pulling for Belinelli!!  Edit: cap projected around $69M, Dubs currently on the hook for about $83M, DLee gonna make $15.5M... so my math doesn't really work.  But getting below the apron by moving Lee will give the Warriors back their MLE and maybe the BAE too?  So it makes a difference.  If they sign Dray before moving Lee, they won't have either exception, just the MMLE."

warriors,3bsbz2,Jojobelle,2,Wed Jul 1 19:34:57 2015 UTC,"Well, making an offer for an RFA means you got a cap hold until the offer is matched (or not matched), so you a) need to have sufficient cap space to offer a deal in the first place and b) are limited in your abilites to sign other players, so unless you got your own stuff sorted out already, offering a RFA a deal is actively limiting your options to go after UFAs."
