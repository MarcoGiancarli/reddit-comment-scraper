StockMarket,3e4bxq,AndyMcConnel,3,Wed Jul 22 08:39:41 2015 UTC,Same chart formation as last earnings. Pumped up leading to earnings and then dropped after they announced.
StockMarket,3e4bxq,DOWNV0TET0OBLIVI0N,3,Wed Jul 22 00:24:42 2015 UTC,"I think the AH is just a sign of how much speculative money moved into Apple in the last week, hoping for a big beat. When those people saw a small beat, they all dumped at once, driving the relatively small volume AH market down in a disproportionate way. Give it a week to shake out. When investors get back in the market, it will drift back up."
StockMarket,3e4bxq,freelancer5005,0,Wed Jul 22 01:07:49 2015 UTC,"This. Essentially buy the rumor/sell the news as always and as others have said. I didn't even look at the numbers but this is generally how all big companies work. even stuff like NFLX, GOOG recently which have these massive spikes for stocks their size, they will likely drift back down as the overreaction settles and then the real move will happen. Just goes to show why you can't gamble on earnings, or if you do you have to at least understand that it is in fact a gamble. You really can never tell which way the market will go. I've seen companies beat earnings and tank, beat earnings and shoot off like a rocket, miss earnings and shoot off like a rocket, miss earnings and tank, and all of the above with no move at all. It's completely unpredictable which is why I personally don't hold through earnings."
StockMarket,3e4bxq,ghostofgbt,2,Wed Jul 22 03:43:21 2015 UTC,It's not that uncommon to sell some after a good earning statement if you dont plan to be in long term.

StockMarket,3e39pb,LisleSwanson,8,Tue Jul 21 16:58:08 2015 UTC,From someone who works in the industry. Stay away from anything oil and gas till there's a sign that oil prices are going to rise.
StockMarket,3e39pb,ichru4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:46 2015 UTC,I had a position in Canadian Oil thinking I could catch a low on the year and wait for the eventual rise. Its tied up funds in the end with no real shortterm outlook. Theres better options in the next ~6 months unless you have insider

StockMarket,3e39pb,needmoretape,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"How would anyone know whether it's time to buy without knowing your time horizon? The answer could just as easily be yes as no.   If you're trading using ""new lows"" as your setup (as I'm inferring from your post), there's really no way to answer the question using a sample of one. I wouldn't personally build a thesis for buying a single stock on a new low unless it was in a general sector that was outperforming over three months along with a few confirming technicals I'd like to see (like money flow), for what it's worth. That because my time horizon is typically swing or longer for these kinds of setups.  Lastly, I wouldn't personally buy a company ticker in a beaten-down sector based on its new lows. I'd buy a sector ETF that was oversold and wait until the overall sector was showing some price reversion.  So, no."
StockMarket,3e39pb,TheMeIWarnedYouAbout,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:04 2015 UTC,Agreed. There is a reason you don't see people celebrating New 52wk Lows
StockMarket,3e39pb,needmoretape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:29:15 2015 UTC,"If you really wanted to play oil (and a lot of people are too scared), COP is probably one of the better plays. HAL also has the reach to survive a squeeze, they're up 5% this week. Just stay away from off shore drilling (e.g. SDRL)  That said, I'm not sure we are going to see oil prices rebound this summer. I sold my HAL calls last month at a decent gain. Onto HABT earnings play"
StockMarket,3e39pb,vagbuffet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:13 2015 UTC,It's pretty remarkable that they are increasing the divie despite the EPS getting trashed.  Let's look at EPS trends   2014A $3.14 2015E $0.28 2016E $2.24   Then DPS   2014A $2.88 2015E $2.91   I don't get how they can maintain the excess DPS > EPS. Unless they are expecting a bounce in oil prices.  Here's our analysis and here's Reuters
StockMarket,3e39pb,shane_stockflare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. They are selling assets, laying off employees and paying for it huge. Just look at $HAL, which is oil services. Their year over year revenue went from $775MM to $54MM which is a 93% drop. Thats fucking crazy. $COP is toast in the short term. However, probably a good buy after the dust settles."
StockMarket,3e39pb,d4ng3rz0n3,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:29:13 2015 UTC,"COP's cancellation of that offshore contract shouldn't come as a surprise given their focus on reducing longer-term drilling expenditures, and just an overall tightening of expenses during the current oil climate.  In tandem with reducing these types of offshore expenditures (and reducing their overall spending by about 5.6 billion dollars from 2014), they raised their dividend last week a penny.  I see this as a commitment of returning value to their shareholders during these trying times.  Who knows when oil will ""make a recovery"" (if it ever will), but oil is typically cyclical and if I were to be in oil, it'd be with companies like COP."
StockMarket,3e39pb,briankev,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:00:42 2015 UTC,"They canceled a 3 year drilling contract in the last week with Ensco. Penalty alone on that contract is day rate ($550,000) x 2 years. If they are willing to give away $400mm like that for nothing, doesn't bode well for the rest of their business outlook."

StockMarket,3e2vlx,GaryBarton,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"I would be very careful with sunpower right now. They have the most efficient cells, but as a result they are also significantly more expensive. I haven't done the calculations recently to determine the $/watt value of one of their panels vs another manufacturer but I talked to a friend who owns a solar installation company and he said they just don't make sense.   You can install a greater number of cheaper panels, with lower efficiency, and come out cheaper in terms of $/watt for your overall system. The higher efficiency really comes in when you start considering niche applications where space is a premium (the solar powered plane solar impulse currently circumnavigating the world uses sunpower cells).   Solar subsidies and net metering are really the only thing keeping them alive. Net metering is starting to saturate grids and may not be an option soon. In California for example its capped at 5% of peak demand. I think it was recently reported to be about 2.5-3%. When people start losing the ability to sell their excess energy back to the grid sunpower is going to be one of the first to go. I don't see any evidence that the grid operators are looking to expand distributed power generation like rooftop solar. Renewables are already a nightmare to integrate on large scales and small unreliable distributed systems are even worse.   I can't speak much for their commercial operations but I would guess they have the same problem.   They are a high performance high cost cell competing in a field where low cost is everything. In my opinion, there's way too much uncertainty to throw any money at them."
StockMarket,3e2vlx,number1masterdebater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, no. The article cites a 45% growth rate for a DECADE. If you keep up to date with literally ANY news, you know solar power is absolutely fucked long term, so don't be deceived by this nice statistic. Its not volatile enough to make quick short term profits either. Honestly, its not a buy in my opinion."
