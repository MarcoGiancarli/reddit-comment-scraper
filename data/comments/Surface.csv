Surface,3e2rmw,ChEChicago,5,Tue Jul 21 15:07:11 2015 UTC,I have a good deal with T mobile where they match my cell phones data plan up for 5GBs for $10 a month on my tablet.  I don't always use it but it does come in super handy sometimes.  Along with not needing to waste my phone battery/tether limit.  I've been waiting for awhile now.

I'm not sure how OneNote handles those, but that could easily be the problem. TBH, there aren't great solutions for finding these in PPT. You can go in, select the first image you come across, click the compress image option and make sure the check boxes are set to apply the compression to all images, but that isn't a perfect solution.

To be honest, the only time the fan starts up (at barely audible levels), is when I'm watching a video on a site that uses shitty flash, and I am using firefox. On IE, it doesn't even get warmer. You wouldn't be able to hear the fan on the lower speeds in a lecture. Nor would you disturb anyone.   The only time I've had the fan on max is when I've been playing games. The fan lags behind the temperature quite a bit, spools up,  and remains on max / high until the temperatures are down.

Surface,3e3f3c,Thotaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"WELL Depends on what you are planning to use it for. Here's my experience:  The surface is a lot more mobile than a regular laptop. I usually use my desktop when I am at home but recently went on a trip to my relatives and I brought my surface with me. It was super useful. I was able to remove the keyboard and lay on the couch to watch some netflix, then I could move to a table and browse some reddit and read email. Every now and then I plug in my mouse and was able to play Dota2. Whenever my relatives ask me questions, i could just quickly launch my surface and show them say the maps, it's touch screen so I was able to show off my awesome techs. If I had used laptop, I would have had to pull it out, flip it, wait for windows to load, type in passwords, click chrome ... etc, it would not been as cool. The surface is amazing for traveling. It is also pretty good for taking note and for drawing since you can write on it like pen on paper.  Laptop on the other hand, can stay on your lap, surface can't really. A laptop has better keyboard, so if you are planning to use it to program a lot or write essay a lot, a laptop is probably a better option. A laptop is probably a lot cheaper for a same specs as the surface. A laptop also has cd drives, more than 1 usb plug and probably hdmi and a lot of other plugs on it, surface doesn't. Surface requires a lot more tool to connect to tv and monitors and only 1 usb plug. If you are planning to bring your surface to do a presentation, you will probably have a bad time."

Surface,3e3f3c,jussnf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"well, maybe i described it poorly. it's a lot of the small things that add up.  with the surface, you just place it on the table, press the side button, type in password and it's ready to go.  with a laptop, you need to carry the whole thing over (usually has poorer grip and heavier), flip it open (lets be honest here, flipping a laptop open kinda sucks), press the power button (usually hard to reach so people won't accidentally hit it), poke at the flimsy screen that is attached to the keyboard and doesn't have that little support on the back as the surface do. laptop are also a usually a bit bigger than the surface so the screen is separated from you by the huge keyboard, poking it as a touch screen is less practical than a surface.  but if I have to do a lot of typing and coding and multitasking, I would prefer a laptop for stability over mobility."
Surface,3e3f3c,GTinLA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:29 2015 UTC,"Like you said the X1 is more expensive but if you aren't going to be using a stylus for any reason there isn't as much of a point in getting a Surface. I would personally go for battery life and laptop usability, although many here would argue that the Surface performs those duties just as well.  The Surface Pro with keyboard is lighter than most but the Thinkpad is THE lightest 14 inch notebook at 3 pounds, only .6 pounds heavier than the SP3 w/ keyboard. Add a case to the Surface Pro and they would be even (Since you probably won't need a case for the X1, as you won't be holding it in your hand). X1 will give you more screen space and a much more comfortable keyboard.  Since the SP3 is an older model now, for a better comparison you could also consider a refurb or cheaper Haswell X1 Carbon to bring the cost down.   But as this is the Surface subreddit after all, I recommend getting the SP3 and start taking notes using OneNote :) It will change your life if you don't already do something similar."

Also try and find any twitter accounts or other social media. Bad press like that will look very bad and they will want to hopefully remedy the situation.

I noted that she said ""For now, Pen tips is still not available in any Microsoft Store that's why we have that option.

It sounds like your approach is what they're expecting, reinstall or fresh install from a bootable media you can create after you upgrade to Windows 10.   Can I reinstall Windows 10 on my computer after upgrading?  Yes. Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free  upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean  install, on the same device. You won’t need to purchase  Windows 10 or go back to your prior version of Windows and  upgrade again.  You’ll also be able to create your own installation media like a  USB drive or DVD, and use that to upgrade your device or  reinstall after you’ve upgraded.   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq?faq=upgradeall&ocid=reserve_r_PostReserve_mod1_faq"

Surface,3e2zdi,mrbeezkneez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"You can probably achieve the same result by installing the upgrade then performing a refresh of your device. This resets the desktop environment to wipe any questionable software and drivers from your machine, but preserves your Store apps, settings, data, and most importantly, your upgrade license.  Microsoft has also said that you will receive a product activation key at some point so you can do a fresh install from an ISO image and still be licensed.  Also, don't forget that you can't do a clean install now, as the activation keys for the current and past Preview builds will no longer work. You will have to wait until GA on July 29 at least."

They are optically bonded so it's not something you can typically do at home. There are a lot of sellers who sell just the LCDs (especially for iPhones), which in my opinion is a border line scam.

Tbh, as a tablet the S3 has a ton of potential that should realize sometime after the release of Win10 goes mainstream and jolts the terrible app ecosystem. Even a mediocre app ecosystem would make it a great tablet. When that happens it will be a completely amazing device, but until then, it's greatness relies in its ability to also be a great and portable lap/desk device.   Try it out for more than a few days (it took me a few to figure out how to make it work for me as a tablet -- get past that point before you decide) and as long as the place you get it from has a reasonable return policy, you are set.   I'll second how nice the pen is. No more paper notepads for meeting notes -- onenote is amazing."

Surface,3e0hbm,javiergame4,2,Tue Jul 21 00:53:48 2015 UTC,"I bought a S3 yesterday, without a type cover, and though I'll get one at some point if there's a sale, I'm pretty much just using it in portrait as a tablet. I see you're intending to get the pen--definitely do, it's brilliant; I've been writing the hell out of OneNote in the past day.  Compared to an iPad Air (or the Sony Xperia tablet Z I've been using previously), the S3 feels a little more substantial to hold (to quote late lawyer Donald Gennaro: ""are they heavy?"" ""Yes"" ""Then they're expensive""), and the iPad's rounded edges might be more ergonomic, but the S3 is still pretty light and you can comfortably hold it in one hand for extended periods. The screen brightness is good and the aspect ratio makes such a difference for reading PDFs or browsing the web in portrait.   It's true, as other redditors point out, that the app ecosystem is comparatively sparse. But I've found things for most of my needs: Nextgen Reader is a great Feedly client; Hyper for YouTube; and the Netflix and Kindle apps are good. You can also fall back on desktop programs if there are missing things here--Spotify for example (but bear in mind that most desktop programs not designed for touch are quite fiddly to use with the touchscreen).  In short, the S3 offers a great experience as a tablet and feels complete in that capacity without the type cover."

Although the S3 is only slightly smaller than the SP3, it feels much more comfortable to hold for media consumption. Although i have a keyboard i don't think ive ever used other than to try it out.   One thing to note is that if you're after a conventional tablet experience, like the Android or IOS offerings, the Microsoft store is severely lacking in quality apps and does not help add to the experience.

If you want to use the stylus, it's not a bad buy but if everything you want can be done with an iPad or Android tablet... well, it's not like the Surface is a bad tablet, it's just that the other options will probably be cheaper (and the Windows Store is a bit meh, but hey, it runs everything your desktop will)."

I even used it last night with my xboxone controller to play Borderlands2 that I installed from steam but the S3 wouldn't have enough hardware for that.  As for the type cover, I leave mine on when it's not in use and sometimes when laying in bed just browsing facebook or reddit I yank it off.

In most universities you have to do a lot of writing, and you'll want a keyboard.  If you are on a really strict budget and can only spend ~$400-600 on your only computer, just get a decent laptop and skip the Surface, as nice as it is.

The research I did might help you.  1) The i7 throttles itself due to a risk of overheating because the fans aren't powerful enough/poor design. 2) the i5 with 8gb of ram has been known to do the job, but most having a desktop/laptop with 16gb of ram to do heavy lifting if required. 3) The new chipsets most likely being used in the S4/SP4 have the potential to mitigate the throttling due to overheat. While this should be kept in mind, there are only rumors at the moment regarding the new device.  The next date of importance is the windows 10 release, if you can wait for a potential announcement, otherwise go the i5/8gb."

If mid range desktops in 2001 can handle it then the worst tablet on the market can handle it.   You will be limited by RAM.  The more RAM you have the larger projects you will be able to open. If you have a PC running solid works right now open up your largest project and see how much RAM the solidworks thread uses now.  If it is well below 4GB then a 4GB model will be fine.  If it is more than 3GB or getting close then get an 8GB one.  If it uses 6+ then you probably need a device with more RAM.   CPU won't really be a bottleneck so don't worry about that. .

I tried doing it online but they charge $1.05.  I move into my dorm in exactly a month and my parents are still hesitant to buy me a laptop. Part of me wants to wait for the SP4, but I'm slowly realising that I would rather save money on similar spec version of an older model than to spend more money for the newest item.   The next fews days will probably be me pestering my parents to buy the SP3."

Technically it'll work if they scan it in, but on the coupon it says you can't use it with any other coupons, so odds are they won't let you use it. That being said, if you end up getting someone new, they might use it anyway. Don't count on it though.  Honestly, all signs point to the Pro 4 coming out in 2016, so I don't regret picking this up one bit. And even if it did come out this year for some reason, it'd be after school started so I'd still be satisfied with my decision to play it safe.  Edit: Does it cost money to acquire which coupons? There is no charge to get the Student coupons."

If you're feeling buyer's remorse I would suggest that you return the S3 and then postpone your purchase until the SP4 is announced (SP3 prices would fall when 4 releases).  Also the SP3 is actually very quiet, especially during normal tasks. I rarely hear the fan on mine - when web browsing temps are typically 38-45C for me (depending on # of tabs)."
Surface,3e0tso,T_GTX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:45 2015 UTC,I don't think your usage justifies the extra spend. The S3 is pretty comparable to the SP3 size wise.   The S3 also doesn't sound like a helicopter processing at full speed. My Pro 3 with an i5 can be heard across my office on fridays (when no one's around)...  I think the only justification is a jump to the 4/128/i5 if you do it. That 4th gen i3 is lacking to say the least.

Surface,3e0tso,Trickybuz93,3,Tue Jul 21 04:05:23 2015 UTC,"My Pro3 (i5) is generally quiet most of the time, the fan only spins up when I have a lot of tabs open, sometimes when watching videos, playing games, or otherwise taxing the CPU. When I'm writing code, doing general browsing, or most kinds of video (Netflix usually doesn't trigger the fan unless the room is warm), my SP3 is silent.  The fan isn't loud per-se, it's just the pitch of the fan that makes the noise audible, especially in a quiet room. For example, I don't notice the fan at all when other things are going on, but if I'm just laying in bed while the GF is sleeping, then I do notice it. In short, it isn't bad at all, unless you're studying with someone who absolutely has to have silence.  Edit: To answer your question, no, none of my professors have noticed the fan. And as far as overheating goes, my i5 only gets warm when I'm gaming. For taking notes on pdfs or PowerPoint, the fan generally won't kick on."
Surface,3e0tso,DroSalander,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:25:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd stick with the Surface 3, unless there's something specific you need the extra processing for. Losing half your storage for the i3 would not be worth it to me, and while I've never used Stata (we used Minitab), I can't imagine you'd need the extra processing power.  The extra screen size can be a blessing or a curse. I have rather large hands, so the 12"" screen fits me great, but others find it uncomfortable."
Surface,3e0tso,DroSalander,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:28:49 2015 UTC,"the screen size is mainly my deciding factor. I find along with it not being optimal with my hand size, the scaling was done in such a way that may icons awkward to hit-- many a time too small or on the edge of the screen."
Surface,3e0tso,DroSalander,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't had a chance to see a S3 in person yet, but the  icons are small on the SP3 as well. Now it is not a problem for me as I have 20/10 vision, but I'm not sure if the increased screen size would help. The best thing you could do is go try one in person and see what you think. Additionally, if you really have to have a SP3, you  might want to think about going for the i5 version. The i3 is okay and all, but sometimes you're really going to want that turbo clock speed, and being limited to ~25 GB of space on the i3 model also might give you buyers remorse.  Just something to think about."
Surface,3e0tso,wcbzero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"Stata has to load all of it data sets into RAM, so if you are processing large datasets I would suggest you need RAM more then you need CPU."

Drawboard PDF is nearly perfect for this and is available in the Microsoft Apps store. As an example, I use Drawboard  to create ""hand-written"" answer keys from pdfs of worksheets. As a chemistry teacher, I can write structural formulas using the pen much easier than any other way on computer. I use my surface as my main computer at work.

You can write on PDFs, or anything really, for lessons while recording the whole thing as a video and then uploading it somewhere else. You can also export things written in Windows Journal or OneNote as PDFs (i tend to use Windows Journal for lessons and OneNote for other things). With the Wireless Display Adapter, you can walk around the class, use the camera as a visualiser, or hand the SP3 over to a student for a presentation or something. Not to mention that industry standard e-learning authoring software runs perfectly well on the i5 4gb version as well.

Not because of any nonsense about the i7 throttling but simply because for most people double the SSD is more useful than the slight increase in GPU power of the i7.  I bought an i7 for the 512GB storage (and the better GPU). If I could have gotten a i5 with a 512GB SSD I probably would have.
Surface,3dy6mb,Heinemenusch,2,Mon Jul 20 14:48:05 2015 UTC,I second this opinion. CPU speed/strength is a soft limit: if you don't have enough then things get temporarily slow and mildly annoying. SSD space is a hard limit: when you run out you're going to have a bad day.

Surface,3dy6mb,ratshack,4,Mon Jul 20 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"What do you plan to use it for? There's very little the i7 will do better than the i5, largely due to the SP3's thermal throttling.  Though in cases where it doesn't throttle or where there's heavy gpu use (i7's gpu has more execution units, iirc) the i7 should be superior.  So while I lean towards saying go with the i5, the storage can be upgraded externally (micro sd and usb), but the processor can't. I don't believe that the i5 will become unusably slow in 4 years, but it makes sense to skimp on storage over processor, since one can be upgraded and one can't."

If this is a college workhorse computer (writing, web, some graphics software), the i7 won't make a big difference.

I have the full suite of office stuff plus a bunch of random IT stuff and really don't worry much about ram or storage at all.

That would have satisfied a lot of people who either bought a SP3 with reservations, or didn't buy at all waiting for the SP4, and it would have satisfied a lot of business customers who need to know that their accessory purchases are going to have some support.  Now, they've waited so long that no matter what they do, one side is going to be unhappy. If the SP4 is completely new, the press and the consumer side is going to be giddy, but business customers are going to be put off by the lack of consistency, and by the lack of communication as it is widely known that they stated that accessories will be good for two generations. Even if that was never true, MS has done nothing to back people away from that expectation.  If it is compatible with existing accessories, then everyone else is going to be disappointed and MS risks alienating the tech-savvy market that expects much more from the next device...

If it sat in a price range that was comparable then maybe, but as it stands your paying $300 more (not sure if the Vaio comes with the keyboard, if it does this drops to $150) to get a minor boost in CPU.

The pen hardware has a nice solid feel in the hand without being too heavy or too thin. The latency is lower than a cintiq. But the biggest thing of all is the super thin screen stack makes the parallax very low, compared to every other solution on the market.  I haven't had to change my battery since I got it at launch and it gets used most days, so it having a 50 cent battery is no issue and is part of the reason the weight feels good in the hand.

The SP3 has things like good palm rejection (generally, palming the Windows button doesn't activate it while I'm writing; palming the screen doesn't activate buttons), excellent multitouch support (BetterTouchTool shows that 3,4 and 5 finger gestures are recognized extremely accurately). I don't get phantom edge touches if I hold it wrong like some devices I've used. The screen doesn't take a moment to ""wake up"" after you swipe on it (which drove me crazy on an Acer Switch 11 I owned).   The battery and processor seem to behave predictably - it doesn't seem to drain for no reason. It wakes and sleeps reliably and hibernates rather than leave you with a dead battery two days later. The fan doesn't spin up for no reason - only when it's doing something identifiably processor-intensive.  The keyboard basically works OK. The trackpad doesn't freak out from poor grounding, even if it's not perfect. The pen is awesome and well-engineered.  The speakers are good enough. The kickstand is solid. WiFi feels reliable (apparently it used to suck, but I didn't use it with the original firmware). The power connector is easy to connect and disconnect. The mic doesn't elicit feedback complaints or echo complaints on Skype calls.  The build quality is excellent. Good cases, docks and other accessories are widely available with plenty of different choices.

To me, the streaming option is a good way to handle this problem. If I'm desperate to play away from my desktop or if I just want to hop on a game to run a quick task/quest/etc or something, streaming on the S3 is a fine option.  From what I've seen from others, including folks in this thread, there are plenty of great and fun games that are a bit more towards the ""casual"" spectrum that will easily work installed on an S3.

And with Windows 10 you don't get this sense that there are two totally different operating systems each having their own unique paradigms fighting for dominance on your device.   For example, in Windows 10, desktop software automatically transitions to full screen in tablet mode and behaves more like modern apps (you can swipe down to close a desktop app, for example).   And you don't have the ""hidden"" UI that casual users struggle to discover. Nor the confusing web browsing experience, with two versions of the default browser.

Lots of experience with digital hand written note taking and have also used my brother's SP3 without any problems.  Whatcha want to know:   It's awesome. I'll never go back to paper. Negatives? Some professors simply do not like it, regardless of what kind of student you are. :( Stylus is perfectly sufficient in its use. Of course there are some differences between my SP2's wacom stylus and the SP3's nTrig, however I have used both and have zero problems going from one to the other or using either in a quickly paced lecture type of environment. I have pretty good handwriting I suppose (everyone tells me this), so I do not have any adjustments when going from pen/paper to SP2/3. However, I have been writing digital notes for over 4 years now, so perhaps I am just really used to it. I have found OneNote's OCR amazing. It is so useful when needing to study for midterms and finals. Perhaps my positive experience could be attributed to my handwriting. I use OneNote desktop @ 100% magnification, although have been pleased with the new OneNote on Windows 10. I hear many on this subreddit to zoom in further to increase handwriting legibility. I did that to an extent on my Android tablet back in the day, but have found no real need to on my Surface, except when drawing tables and diagrams which I am OCD about being nearly perfect haha. Really easy to copy/paste handwritten text, tables, diagrams, etc within OneNote, or across to other MS Office applications.  I would, for the many reasons I have listed above already. To add to that, I am so used to digital notes now, that when I have to write an essay for a final I find myself reaching for the undo button at the top of the page... lol. It is also awesome to have my notes in the cloud. I can access them on my android phone, or windows desktop. However, it does take some time. You just simply must get used to it. Some people really rely on that physical page, to touch, feel, etc... or get distracted too easily b/c they are on a computer. Neither bother me.   Your use case:   I think I have answered these, but it is easy to take notes IMO. It is also easy to search within these notes too. And I am with you on typing notes. I do not like it. I really prefer hand written notes because I retain it better and am able to draw tables and diagrams, arrows and what not.

Surface,3dvd91,Eugr,2,Sun Jul 19 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies so far! Very helpful. One additional question. PDFs and annotation. What app do you use for this, does the pen+palm blocking work okay in it?"
Surface,3dvd91,new_ion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:03:24 2015 UTC,"Onenote can work just fine - I've yet to get the multi-page pdf import to a single onenote page working, but I know it exists. I only really tried once too.   You can also use the built in PDF reader.   That said, apparently Drawboard is fantastic. I haven't purchased it, though."
Surface,3dvd91,nepsdahc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"Drawboard is good, but seems to have bugs from time-to-time.  Palm rejection works the same with every app.  Once the pen is detected within 2"" of the screen, all other touches are ignored."
Surface,3dvd91,PianoConcertoNo2,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:38 2015 UTC,"I'll be a returning student, and bought the SP3 a few months back in preparation.  I used the iPad with a non active stylus a few years back, and actually intended to use my air 2 for notes - until I demoed the SP3 with OneNote.  All together - this is so much better than the iPad.  Writing feels so much more natural.    I have some old PDF textbooks I've been reviewing from - one of the coolest features is being able to do split screen with the PDF file in one pane (or video), and one note in the other.  Of course I could write on the PDF too.  Ive used copy and paste a few times for diagrams, and had no issue.  I was able to resize them, and snipe images from the screen and paste them into one note.  Ive noticed too - infrequently the pen will stop working.  I don't know if its a battery issue (is there a way to check?  They're not that used), and I think it happens more so with 3rd party apps.    Usually it comes back pretty quick, and often pressing the Bluetooth button gets it back. But it is infrequent.    Its a much better upgrade from the iPad, and I really can't wait to have it for classes."
Surface,3dvd91,qurun,3,Mon Jul 20 01:58:35 2015 UTC,"One possible problem is that Microsoft tries to lock you in to using OneNote.  If you export to PDF, it does not export the recognized handwriting (for searches).  (Hyperlinks won't work, either.)  This could be a problem if you need to access your research again five years from now.    Search works well, and I am paperless now.  Copy-paste does not work well.  It is extremely slow and can crash OneNote.  Sometimes the pasted text will have different spacing than what you copied, e.g., two lines that had been separate will be pasted directly on top of each other, which is basically impossible to pull apart without rewriting them.  (Be sure to back up your notes!)  I have no idea why such a basic functionality doesn't just work.    Overall, though, it works okay.  Night and day compared to an iPad."

Surface,3dx01b,Micromeds,2,Mon Jul 20 06:00:20 2015 UTC,The surface 3 sounds perfect for your needs. It's not too powerful like your laptop but it does the job and it can handle a lot of tasks pretty well! If you plan do do things like modeling you might want to go for the 4gb ram version but 2gb sounds plenty enough for note-taking and light media consumption.    The difference between the two devices would be ram and storage. 4gb ram/128gb storage vs 2 gb ram/ 64 gb storage. Price difference is 100$ so that might help you make your decision. Bye!
Surface,3dx01b,ramsicles,2,Mon Jul 20 09:52:08 2015 UTC,I second the Surface 3 as it sounds like the one better suited for you. I myself have the SP3 i3 version but that's because I prefer the larger screen size for drawing too and I do not find the size and weight difference that heavy for me.  Definitely check out some demo units near you and take advantage of your student discount if you can.
Surface,3dx01b,youngkai2047,2,Mon Jul 20 11:06:04 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend the surface 3 for you as well.  I would goto a best buy or something to try our the demo units first just to see the difference in screen size between the non-pro and the pro.  For me, the Surface Pro 3 (and my original Pro 1) was just too big to ever hold like a book or casually browse the web/reddit.  +1 on that student discount opportunity - don't miss out on that one."

Surface,3dwwoo,gflare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I actually ended up buying one of the last Pro 2 units available rather than a Pro 3, in part because of the issues people had experienced.

As for the i5 vs i7, I have an i7 and using photoshop or running updates will definitely make the fan kick on causing the laptop to be noticeably loud.

Surface,3dw6pq,TheKingHippo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:36:13 2015 UTC,"Background: I have the core i5, 8gb RAM version. I use it as my work computer (finance) and have some pretty heavy programs on it for tracking data, etc.     Result: When using heavy programs the fan is noticeable and nearly instant, however! it is in no way annoying. You can hear it, but it is a quiet steady sound. The fan will occasionally run at other times as well, but it's not random. I almost always find an excess of something running in the background if that is happening. The top-right of the surface is the hottest by far and while it isn't noticeable with normal use I wouldn't put it on my lap as a tablet while this was happening.    Recommendation: Honestly, they just released a new version with an i7 at the same pricepoint as the i5. (It has a 128gb hard drive to compensate) I would probably get that as onedrive makes hard drive storage largely obsolete. I will say that my i5 certainly performs as expected. I am very happy with the device."

You can for example set up a CTRL+C/V button to make for quick and easy copy/pasting.   If you'll be drawing there's an option to adjust the sensitivty curve of your pen.

The bigger problems with an iPad pro, assuming Apple doesn't break all its normal rules, is that it will be absurdly expensive, have a single port, will sell everything ala cart, storage upgrades will be 400%+ marked up over market SD cards, not allow SD/MicroSD and be restrictive as to where you can get software.

If I didn't do that, I would've definitely considered a Surface. I went to play one for the first time a few weeks ago and it was really nice.  Years ago, I was a big iPhone guy until I started to get bored with it, as it was a very standard experience so I switched to Android. I've been feeling the same with OS X lately, seemes like MS and Win10 are trying out cool new things and Mac are playing it safe."

If you can google for your receiver, check out roughly the distance between the tip of the receiver and where the side holes begin. The piece of plastic you slip in needs to go in further than that distance in order for it to provide the ""slide"" needed to separate the two.

Doesn't look great, but it works. You have nothing to lose giving it a try to be honest. Just keep the resolution low and all settings low, even check if you can change some settings in the config files (if there is one).  A lot of it comes down to how well optimized the game you want to run is, there are plenty of AAA games that run like shit even on good PC's."
Surface,3dvrui,ashsimmonds,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:59:21 2015 UTC,"Took me a lot of research and testing (probably sunk 12+ hours into benchmarking over 2 weeks) but I've got GTAV running at 40-60fps on my SP3 and it rarely goes below 25fps.    I'm an old-school gamer and given I rarely play video games I'm happy for my occasional hour every week or so to be at 800x600 with occasional oddball texture issues and such. Half the time it's late at time and I'm drunk anyway so hardly going to miss/appreciate those luscious textures, I just want some fun for a while.    So yeah if you're looking to impress neckbeards online with your gaming rig, SP3 won't do much but get you ridicule, but as a casual on-the-run gaming experience I find it perfectly adequate. I took mine into the office today because a co-worker was recently complaining he had to upgrade his desktop cos it only has dual core processors and such (but still a reasonable graphics card and SSD etc), I cranked up GTAV with the DS4 controller and he seemed reasonably impressed. Not enough to love the graphics up close like that, but I reckon it'll inspire him to try something other than trying to squeeze out mega HD from his aging setup instead of trying to upgrade everything for $$$ just for a couple hours of fun a week."

I'm pretty sure the battery will last through the 1 year warranty period. (Microsoft Rep): If I may ask, may I know if you just recently purchase your Surface Pro 3 device? (Me): I bought it last week (Microsoft Rep): Thank you so much for the details. (Me): Online I found a Reddit AMA with the surface team. They said that a battery replacement will be $200 out of warranty, but I would like to confirm that (Microsoft Rep): I am glad to inform you that our local Microsoft Store offer an extended warranty which will also cover accidental damage protection. (Me): I'm not sure if you are allowed to view Reddit at work but here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26m9cu/we_are_panos_panay_and_the_surface_team_at/chsei5u (Microsoft Rep): Oh! My apologies but we cannot open third party links. (Me): ok. Still, it is likely that the battery will stay in acceptable shape through the to year Microsoft Complete period (Me): Oh ok (Me): Here is the text of the comment: (Me): To sum up: We’ve built a great battery into the product (details above). IF the battery fails during the warranty period, we’ll replace the battery. IF the battery fails after the warranty period, you’ll call Microsoft support and arrange for the battery to be replaced. The cost will be $200 USD. (Microsoft Rep): Let me then explain to you our Surface Pro 3 Out of warranty replacement offer as of the moment. (Me): THank you (Microsoft Rep): Extended warranty. (Microsoft Rep): If the device is already out of warranty and the battery still won't work after doing all the steps in resolving the issue.  The replacement for the whole device will cost $320. It's a great deal rather than buying a new one and there is also an additional 90 day warranty. (Me): Alright. That does seem to contradict the information provided by the Surface team though (Me): $120 difference (Microsoft Rep): We would suggest to verify us the information since we do not have a direct contact with Reddit. For the $200 replacement that was an out of warranty offer the Surface RT and Surface 2 devices before. (Me): Ok. Since you cannot view outside links I am not sure how prove that the source is correct to you. (Microsoft Rep): Our replacement is actually system generated (Me). That is why we assure you that he information we have is 100% correct. (Microsoft Rep): As a surface user myself, I do understand your worries and how you feel about this concern. (Me): Yes, that would make sense. I am confused as to why it would be announced that an out-of-warranty battery replacement would be $200 while in reality it is $300 (Microsoft Rep): Always remember that we here at Microsoft will always do whatever we can to make sure all our valued customer's concerns are being taken cared of. This is very important for Microsoft, it's very important for Microsoft to provide you a working Surface. That is why we provide you the best information, options and solutions. (Me): So there is no way for you to view outside links (not just reddit)? The announcement was also on some news sites (Me): Using the Google search query ""surface pro 3 battery replacement $200"", rcpmag, redmondmag, zdnet, and pcworld say the price of a battery replacement is $200 (Microsoft Rep): In the future, I would recommend visiting surface.com where you will be able to view helpful tips and find a lot of answers regarding the Surface device. You will be able to view the forums where the customers can ask and answer questions about the Surface as well. (Me): ZDNet: ""The Surface team noted that while the batteries in Microsoft Surfaces are not user-replaceable, Microsoft will replace the Surface Pro 3 battery if it fails during the warranty period. If it fails after the warranty period, Microsoft support will replace the battery for about $200."" (Me): pcworld: ""Microsoft executives, however, claimed that such a replacement would be relatively rare. They also added a note to mention that the cost of a battery replacement outside of warranty will be $200."" (Me): redmondmag: ""If your system is under warranty, it won't cost anything to have the battery replaced, but Panay (or someone on his team) said replacing the battery on the Surface Pro 3 after the warranty expires will cost $200."" (Me): Again there is no way for you to check that I haven't made up this information (Microsoft Rep): I totally understand your side, (Me). I just got to be very honest with you, we really do not replace the battery as our service center will replace the whole device itself. Our replacement on our end is actually system generated and the price for the out of warranty replacement will cost $320. (Me): and finally rpcmag "" According to a response by a Surface team member, battery replacements are free for Surface devices that are still under warranty, and $200 after the warranty expires."" (Microsoft Rep): You can verify the paid replacement using our site by going to myservice.surface.com. (Me): Ok. Well thank you for the help (Me): I am still confused why battery replacements were advertised to be $200 but actually are $320 (Microsoft Rep): I have been working with Surface for a couple of years and I assure you that I am giving you the correct information we have on our end."
Surface,3dt5y7,LKS,5,Sun Jul 19 13:48:39 2015 UTC,"(Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Hi there (Me). This is (Microsoft Rep), (Microsoft Rep)'s manager. So sorry if I intervene your chat with my Support Representative. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I was actually doing a real time monitoring with the chat session of my agents, and your case got my attention. Hope you don't mind me intervening your chat (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Hope everything is doing great on your end other than the issue that you have today. (Me): Yes, I'm doing fine (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I am glad to know that (Me). (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): As I understand you have some issue with the Surface parts replacement cost/price, right? (Me): yes, battery replacent cost (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I see. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Thanks for the confirmation of your issue my friend. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): With all honest, in the event that Surface device/accessories  is experiencing hardware failure and it needs to be sent to service center for replacement, a free of charge   replacement order can be provided if the  surface is within warranty (1 year manufacturer warranty starts from the original date of purchased). (Me): Yes. Batteries do not normally begin to die until after 3 years or so (Me): which would be out of both the factory warranty and microsoft complete (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Any physical damage like cracked screen or water emersion it is tag as out of warranty device, still we can offer possible replacement. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): However (Me), if the device internal parts are broken, like in your case. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): We can surely offer a replacement for your Surface. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): However it is a full device replacement not parts. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): As of now we don't offer repair but replacement of entire unit itself is available. (Me): Ok. (Me): Battery wear is something that'll happen no matter how the device is treated (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I totally got your point (Me), from a consumer's perspective, I would feel the same way as you do if this issue happen to me as well. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): But just like any other electronic gadgets we use this new technology is very unpredictable and things like this will really happen at times. (Me): Yes. Just to clarify, I haven't experienced any issues with the battery myself. I will still have to replace the battery in a few years due to battery wear. (Me): Yes, I understand. Battery wear is something that is very easily predictable- after 800 cycles a lithium ion polymer's graphite anode will begin to wear down (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Oh that's great to know that you actually not experiencing this issue with your Surface battery. (Me): That's why battery replacement services are offered (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I agree with that. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): However as of now with Surface we don't offer by piece replacement or repair the Surface device. (Me): Since I'm expecting to use my Surface for more than two years I will have to replace the battery. I did some research and found a quote from the Surface team that says that battery replacement will cost $200 (Me): I started this conversation to confirm that (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): As as replacement cost is concern (Me), quoted  price may vary according to what Surface version you have. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): ** As far (Me): Yes. The quotes I provided are all for the Surface Pro 3 (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): As I check you got those infos at this page https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26m9cu/we_are_panos_panay_and_the_surface_team_at/chsei5u. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Right? (Me): Yeah that's where I got my information from (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Hope you don't get me wrong (Me), but to be honest that page is not an official Surface page nor official Microsoft website. (Me): Ok. So the information there was not correct? (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Yes (Me). (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Maybe it is a 3rd party repair tech person who posted those information. (Me): Ok. Could be a bit of a PR issue for Microsoft as this information has been quoted in other news sources (Me): Well thank you for the help (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): You are very much welcome (Me). (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I am thankful as well that you bring this issue to our attention and provided us this link. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Rest assured that this infos will be documented and will be forwarded to appropriate channel for investigation. (Me): You are welcome. In many of the online forums the price for a battery replacement is stated to be $200 with this quote as the source (Me): Likewise many people (including me) bought the device thinking battery replacement to be $200 (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Rest assured we will check those page (Me) so appropriate action will be taken for this misinformation. (Me): Again, thank you for the clarification. I apologise if I was a bit rude (Me): I was just a little bit frustrated (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I totally understand you. We always value our customer's feedback. You're opinion definitely helps us improve our services, who knows that might be possible in the near future. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I am hoping cheaper than $200 though (smile). As I am using Surface pro 3 too. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): It's been an honor chatting with a customer like you (Me). Thanks as well for being so patient and being awesome all throughout our chat session. (Me): It really is a great computer (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I agree. (Me): Thank you for helping me, too (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): It is my pleasure assisting you today. Really happy to know you love our product and services. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): In behalf of Microsoft Surface, we thank you for being loyal to us and giving us the opportunity to serve you. info: Your chat transcript will be sent to bla@example.org at the end of your chat. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): I noted your request here (Me) including this chat conversation. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Rest assured that I will be your voice here to make sure your concern/request will be heard. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Before we call it a day though.  Is there anything else that I could possibly do to make sure that I let you go with a peace of mind? (Me): Thanks (Me): That was it (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Excellent! (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): If you have any concerns or questions feel free to contact us back anytime we are more than happy to help you. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): If that was everything (Me), I'd like to thank you again for contacting Surface Customer Support. (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Have a sweet eve to you and your family! (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Keep safe always! (Me): you too! (Manager) (Microsoft Rep): Thanks a lot.     Easier to read, some comments about the formatting: Two spaces at the end of a line -> New line for the following line. Replacing something with asterisks is a bad idea as everything surrounded by asterisks will bolded/iltalized.

Surface,3drss1,pmow,3,Sun Jul 19 15:15:25 2015 UTC,I've been using it for about 4 months now. I absolutely love this app/engine or whatever it's called. There is so many different combinations of gestures you can assign. I usually add a new one every other week.

It's completely in Chinese, so unless you know a fair share of characters you're going to have a bad time.

Surface,3drss1,DominusVenturae,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:55 2015 UTC,I use it and enjoy it thoroughly. I had an iPad for a few years and got used to 4 finger pinching and app to close it. Thus I made a 4 finger pinch minimize apps and a 5 finger pinch completely shutdown an app.
Surface,3drss1,devbryce,2,Sun Jul 19 04:24:09 2015 UTC,"I do like this app very much.  However, the gestures I use with it tend to also have an undesired effect on whatever app is currently open.  If I use any gesture while chrome is open, chrome acts like an epileptic at a deadmau5 concert."

This app does not and never will contain the gesture engine that actually brings those gestures to life. However, there is a convenient link within the app to obtain the engine. The engine is free to use for 32 days, after that you can either purchase a full license for the engine or continue to use it for free for up to 3 gestures.  ****   So this app only provides the config files to use in a different program? Why wouldn't I just get the gesture recognition engine? Surely it has a UI to define the gestures as well? How can I find the engine without having to install the app just to get the link?"
Surface,3drss1,ashsimmonds,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:21:01 2015 UTC,"Can you set it so that when doing a gesture it doesn't affect anything else on screen?    Eg I've set my volume up/down gesture to 4 fingers anti/clockwise which is really intuitive and great for quicker response than the damn volume button, however it always shrinks/expands/does weird shit to whatever's on the display.    Same with brightness, I've got it set for 4 finger swipe up and down, not as much as a big deal as it tends to just scroll. But over time if I implement more gestures for productivity I'm wondering how many are going to interfere with existing operations.    TL;DR - is there a way to disable all native touch functions when more than 2 fingers are used?"

Edge browser with eventual extension support is a must. Beyond that I don't care too much. Cortana would be nice. Xbox game streaming seems unlikely but would be cool as well.

If your SP3 exhibits the same behavior while browsing or doing basic activities, then I would start to worry. VS isn't a program used by me, so if it's a large installation the fan might be normal.

Here are the solutions I've personally used working with multi monitor setups.   Here are your options:   DP Daisy chain, this involves a dp from your SP3 (or Microsoft dock) to a monitor, then via the monitor's daisy chain port to another monitor. This involves special monitors that support it which can be costly and hard to come by. Lots of people use the DELL U2414H for this task.  requires:  1 x mDP -> dp  1 x dp -> dp  2 x daisy chain compatible screens Two mini display port to external monitors (this requires the Microsoft dock to add an additional mDP). This method is simply 2 mDP to HDMI cables, one to each external monitor.  requires:  2 x mDP -> hdmi  1 x Microsoft dock  2 x monitors A mDP hub, such as this. This can run from your dock or your SP3 and connect to the external monitors.  requires:  1 x mDP Dock such as this  2 x dp -> hdmi  2 x monitors A USB solution - this allows you to run a single monitor from your SP3's mDP to one monitor then use a USB to HDMI for the second monitor. While I've run this myself and is fine for browsing, casual development anything intensive will no doubt have a screen lag as this puts the processing strain on the CPU.  requires:  1 x mDP -> hdmi  1 x USB -> hdmi  2 x monitors   There is also a Mircast/Wireless display option but I have not included it on this answer.

Surface,3dqjnx,the_angel_moroni,2,Sat Jul 18 16:50:32 2015 UTC,"First, contrary to what some have said, a usb dock with monitor support is not your best option, as it will put a (moderate) strain on your cpu. Your cheapest option would be this dock. If your monitors do not have a displayport input you should be able to use these wires. You could of course buy the official dock as well and connect one wire to the dock and the other to the SP3."
Surface,3dqjnx,mcbain07,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:58 2015 UTC,I use this one at work...   http://www.startech.com/AV/Displayport-Converters/Mini-DisplayPort-Triple-Head-DisplayPort-Multi-Monitor-MST-Hub%7EMSTMDP123DP  Is pretty good! Note the lower resolution when connecting two monitors though.  Might not matter depending on what your screens run at!
Surface,3dqjnx,ycnegreme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:55:03 2015 UTC,"Get a MST hub for the Display Port.  If you get a dock afterwards you can use that with the Dock.  However, to use two monitors you will need the MST hub either way unless you get the dock and connect to the SP3 DisplayPort in addition to Dock display port.  Using a USB 3.0 adapter is a solution.  However, this may result in compatibility issues.  These issues won't be present in normal applications.  The issues will be present when trying to game.  If you are trying to use 4k monitors (Unlikely, you're using HDMI) get monitors that are compliant with the newest DisplayPort standard and fully functional.    Anyway, my understanding is that the Club3D is a very stable MST hub.  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB8FB4G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=mmcdl-20"

Install Autohotkey Extract the above zip so that it's contents are contained within C:\Users\Public\TouchToggle\ Run ADMIN Runme Once.bat with ADMIN privileges (user password required here to create the new tasks in Task Scheduler) Log off then back on again   It basically works by using a program called DevManView which allows you to disable devices through the command line. An .exe runs at start up which remaps the purple button on the pen.    The touchscreen will also re-enable after resuming from sleep, just in case you lose the pen or something. If something drastic happens, you can re-enable the touchscreen in Device Manager (it should be the only device disabled).

That being said, in 2 years the parts will be cheaper.

Much less than when it came out.  -Sp3 glass/lcd today costs ~350-500. In 2 years sp3 glass/lcd may be ~200-300.  -Sp3 battery today only costs ~70-80, which will probably not be THAT much cheaper later.

A scenario would be picking up a cold glass of water that has condensation on the outside, drying your hand slightly on a shirt or whatevs and then going back to the felt trackpad. At that point it just goes batshit and won't work or starts jittering everywhere.   If you have one you can try yourself, wet you hand, rub it into the trackpad and it dies within a few seconds. That's the extreme method, but it's the slight condensation scenario that really pisses me off when it just stops working.

FWIW, this is exactly what makes Adobe products and iTunes feel so heavyweight and bloated on Windows, and why it takes forever for these companies to adopt new features in Windows. Photoshop still doesn't properly support high DPI displays, introduced in Vista, and iTunes had never made use of Windows Libraries correctly, introduced in Windows 7.  People still mock me for being computer savvy user who actually chooses to use IE, but it's because I like the way Microsoft has integrated the browser with platform features like HW acceleration, power saving, and settings and password sync.

Beyond that, I like using my older laptop, which is connected to an external display and keyboard, for most everything else.  Regarding comic books, I've been dissatisfied with the recent trends of comic books and quality, but that's allowed me to turn to other hobbies. As such, I couldn't give you advice on the best way to read comic books on a Surface but I'm sure that there are plenty of other threads you can find.

There are listings for less than the MSRP on eBay (although be aware of the some sellers trying to sell other region keyboards disguised as US keyboards) and I was able to secure one through a price match with Tiger Direct at my local Best Buy.  Of all the faults I can find with the Type Cover used on the Surface RT, I would say the mouse pad are would be the worst due to the small size and the use of the same felt material as the keyboard. I've grown fond of the glass bead design on the SP3 and while I know it's not perfect it is still miles better than the Type Cover 2, in my humble opinion."

Surface,3dmw5z,Tchnclly,16,Fri Jul 17 15:49:14 2015 UTC,"This isn't a bad thing. I realize that it's on Slashdot and therefore people immediately assume it's a bad thing, but anyhow.    Mandatory critical updates allows the OS to stay updated automatically instead of relying on the user (who many times is too oblivious to understand the importance of updates) to initiate those updates. Critical updates rarely break things. Optional updates do sometimes break things, but I doubt that automatic updates will include optional updates (it doesn't right now, and optional updates are usually things like driver updates and feature enhancements).    It's incredibly frustrating to work with end users who don't keep their machine up-to-date. It's a bit like someone taking their car to the mechanic only to have the mechanic discover they never changed their oil, and that is in fact the root cause of 99% of their problems with the car.    I work in end-user tech support in retail, and we frequently see users who have never updated Windows. They complain about issues with stability or usability and when you turn on their computer, you discover they never updated to 8.1, or they never installed the April or November 2014 udpate rollups, which include thousands of patches, fixes, and UI improvements.    I've seen exactly two updates actually break things in my line of work - there was an Office RT update like six months ago that broke PowerPoint, and more recently the latest Intel Wi-Fi update available through optional updates sometimes causes problems with a machine's wireless card (it's inconsistent).    If you're that worried about it, upgrade to Pro. Or, if you're paranoid, get an MSDN subscription and use Enterprise."
Surface,3dmw5z,ClairelyClaire,9,Fri Jul 17 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"Or, if you're paranoid, get an MSDN subscription and use Enterprise.   Yeah, it's only like $700.  Super cheap."
Surface,3dmw5z,notwhoithink,3,Fri Jul 17 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed! This is a good thing.  I've never had any trouble with updates, I think the people that do have trouble are installing optional updates without checking what they are or if they need them (like drivers)"
Surface,3dmw5z,wolfcry0,2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"I've bought two SP3's and still highly recommend it, however I've also had two instances where accepting updates automatically has bricked my SP3.  When they released the firmware update, the machine would not come back from the reboot if other items were also in the patching queue.  It took my a fair amount of time the first time I saw it (less then second time when I bought a brand new SP3 and though, erroneously, MS would have taken care of that problem.)    The second time it was a brand new machine with only Office Installed.  I had to go through the hold-button-in-this-order-for-30-seconds procecudure and then wipe the machine, start over, and install updated manually in order to have the firmware update not crash the machine.    I'd prefer to not have to send my machine in to MS in order to address this type of thing."
Surface,3dmw5z,notwhoithink,3,Fri Jul 17 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"I've seen exactly two updates actually break things in my line of work    Good for you.  Microsoft has had to recall faulty patches several times a year for the past few years. Maybe you got lucky.  I know that I did, because I usually wait a few days before patching.  I have a Samsung laptop, so I've seen more than that in just the past two years since I bought it.  When the free update from Windows 8 to 8.1 was released it basically rendered the laptop unusable due to driver issues.  Unusuable, in this case, meaning that it wouldn't even boot successfully into the OS, safe mode, or anything else.  There was a lot of discussion on Samsung forums about it, and the official recommendation was to not upgrade to 8.1 until Samsung worked out all of the kinks, which happened about 6 months after 8.1 was released.  If I didn't have the ability to decline updates then I would have been without my laptop for the entire 6 month period.  There have been a number of other updates since then that have broken some piece of functionality as well.  It turns out that standard device drivers don't usually work on Samsung laptops, you have to have their special Samsung-provided drivers.  The same appears to be the case when moving to Windows 10.  Most of the drivers provided with the 10240 build work correctly, but a few of them do not.  That means that anyone who goes to Windows 10 without testing first is going to have broken functionality unless and until Samsung releases updated drivers.  Because rememeber, this was a laptop that was released in February of 2013.  They may choose to not support it going forward."

For Win10, that program includes making sure every computer released within a certain time frame will successfully upgrade and work on Win10.  I don't know which computers that includes, but I'm certain a computer released within the last 2 years falls within this window.

Surface,3dnbmr,builtby,2,Fri Jul 17 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"So perhaps you are aware of this already, but in case it helps: In Windows 8.1, there is an automatic setting that will adjust display scaling correctly for most monitors. Just make sure that you have NOT checked ""Let me choose one scaling setting for all my displays"".  I dock my Windows devices with 27"" 1440p displays that run at 100% scaling, while the Surface normally looks best at 150%. I've never had a problem with Windows correctly interpreting the scaling setting with any of my devices, which have included several Surfaces and other tablets, plus a laptop.  (There is the caveat that you have to log off then back on again when docking if you exclusively use the external monitor rather than ""extending"" your desktop.)  I believe the main benefit of Windows 10 is that this automatic setting is replaced by the ability to explicitly choose a scaling level for reach display. But unless Microsoft had fixed this log off requirement, this may provide no practical benefit over the automatic setting if it is already working correctly with your hardware."
Surface,3dnbmr,Silversee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:35:30 2015 UTC,"Plus, in Win 8.1, it's not really like the OS is rendering at two different scaling factors. It's rendered at one (the main monitor) and re-sized on the others. This is why it can be slightly blurry on tour secondary monitor. Not sure if Windows 10 actually changes that, I doubt it.  Otherwise, this is absolutely the correct answer."

Surface,3dnbmr,bryanbreguet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:20:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, my SP2 is always connected to a 23"" 1080p monitor.  I get my Surface at 150% and the monitor at 100%. This is absolutely possible. It has been built into Win 8.1 since the beginning. I don't know why so many people in this sub still can't figure it out. You simply need to uncheck ""let me choose one scaling factor"" in the settings and that's it. It's not perfect but it works.  If you don't believe me, here is a detailed article: http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/windows-8-1-and-high-ppi-displays-better-but-still-lacking/  I guess the only thing Windows 10 will do is to actually let us pick the scaling factor for each display, instead of using the slider and having Windows choosing for us (although in your case it wouldn't matter as Windows would already choose 100% and 150% for your screens)."
Surface,3dnbmr,easyxtarget,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:25:00 2015 UTC,It always makes my monitor 125%. Or if I make my monitor the main display it scales 100% and my surface scales smaller than I want it (125% I think). It never really worked like it was supposed to. Windows 10 has much better scaling. Also I think if you use VGA (I had a VGA monitor for a while) it will only scale the monitor to the same size as the surface (at least in my experience).
Surface,3dnbmr,bryanbreguet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:36:21 2015 UTC,"How big is your 1080p monitor? Like the physical size. Do you set the slider to the ""recommended size""? Cause if it really sets your 1080p at 100% if set as primary, the Surface should be at 150% I believe. Exactly like for me.  Anyway, good thing if Win 10 makes it better."
Surface,3dnbmr,easyxtarget,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:50:48 2015 UTC,24 inch. I actually just exchanged my Surface at the store so I'm back on 8.1. I think the scaling only like kind of works. It seems windows scale to 100% on my monitor but certain text is too large and the task bar is definitely too large. Windows 10 was definitely more consistent. The only thing I hate about Windows 10 is the OneDrive changes (you can only see files that are synced to the computer). They need to fix that or I definitely won't be renewing my storage subscription.

Surface,3dnl4a,voiceofid,4,Fri Jul 17 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"I believe Best Buy guarantee their installs, so if they mess it up, they will install a new one  I don't recommend film type screen protectors, I've been using tempered glass units for about 3 years on all my devices and extremely pleased with them. They've also saved two of my devices already (oneplus one 2x, Moto360 1x) from drops. I got the SP3 tempered 2 days after I got it and couldn't be happier.  I haven't noticed reduced sensitivity, but that cuold just be me"
Surface,3dnl4a,shat_my_plants,2,Fri Jul 17 20:04:02 2015 UTC,"They do guarantee them, however if they don't have then in stock you need to wait for one."
Surface,3dnl4a,peatcoal,3,Fri Jul 17 21:11:47 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a tempered glass screen protector if you don't want to spoil the feel of the screen. I got one off eBay for £10 and it's been great. Protects the screen well, easy to install and it feels pretty much the same as the glass underneath. In my experience tempered glass ones also last longer than regular screen protectors as they don't get scratched up as easily. I've been using them on various devices for a couple of years and I don't think I'll ever go back to the regular kind."
Surface,3dnl4a,iammetoo_,3,Fri Jul 17 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"I bought the Zagg tempered glass protector from BB (it was $35'ish on sale) but they wanted to ding me another $15 for the install, and I said no thanks.    Went home, steamed up the bathroom, washed my hands and forearms, lined up the SP, and using the hinge method with some packing tape, applied it 99% perfectly first try.    It DRASTICALLY reduced the sensitivity, honestly, at least initially.  I told myself it would get better as time went on, and it's been on for several months now, and it MAY be better, but it DID reduce the sensitivity, for sure.  (even the gf noticed it, and she actually felt it increased the glare on the screen, as well, FWIW).    I had my SP3 for 4 days when I applied the protector, and I already had a very fine scratch across the front.  And I was uber careful with it, as well.    TLDR - I'd recommend using one, but be aware it will reduce the sensitivity, particularly with touch input.  The stylus seems much less affected.  My .02"
Surface,3dnl4a,Dunshire,3,Fri Jul 17 19:58:13 2015 UTC,"Go with the microsoft tempered glass screen protector over the Zagg glass one. The Microsoft one has little cut-outs at the bottom to accommodate the docking station and the Zagg doesn't. The Docking station will still work with the Zagg, but it will put pressure on screen. As far as the install goes, the glass ones are easy to install, just do it right when you first open the Surface, and in a humid place if you can (steamed up bathroom works fine) to keep down the dust. If you have Best Buy do it, they have to do it in the dry and dusty store which often results in dust getting under the screen. They gaurentee the install though, so if it gets messed up they will put another one on for free, but they don't have a special room for it or even training for it so I wouldn't bother using them."
Surface,3dnl4a,kurtiscaston,2,Fri Jul 17 20:16:34 2015 UTC,I would also be interested to know the answer to this. I've gotten this covering on my phone and my pebble watch but I wonder how it would affect the stylus of the Surface.
Surface,3dnl4a,reddit_sally,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly what i was curious about. I've only known people who have had then on a phone, and I figured the stylus wouldnt work too well. If anything I might order a tempered glass cover from somewhere online."
Surface,3dnl4a,PersiasFigNewton,2,Fri Jul 17 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"Like anything the installation you get at Best Buy is based more on the individual's experience than on anything controlled by the company itself. The ""training"" for this is a youtube video tutorial from Zagg and watching fellow employees before doing a few installation attempts at no extra charge.  Seasoned employees will have more experience and thus do a better job."
Surface,3dnl4a,PianoConcertoNo2,2,Fri Jul 17 20:43:55 2015 UTC,"The best kind of screen protector in my opinion is the tempered glass ones, and there's only a couple of them that make sense:  The Zagg Tempered Glass is sold at BestBuy, and I think they should be able to install it. It's rather pricy ($15?) for their installation fee, but then the obligation is on them and you have some right to be a tiny bit picky about its perfection.  There's also another tempered glass one that the Microsoft Store sells, it's more expensive but for my purchase, they installed it for free for me. It looks great.  Both of these I have had and they do not affect pen or touch input.  Hope this helped!"
Surface,3dnl4a,Lonetrek,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:44:38 2015 UTC,"I got the tempered glass one installed there a few months back.    The guy had to do it twice, because even though he was very thorough with looking for dust getting in - there was a very noticeable speck he noticed after he did it the first time.  He just ripped it off and did it again.    While I could of easily installed it - I would of been stuck with the quality of my first install. With him doing it - if I noticed any dust or anything - I could of had it redone.    It's only $15 for that guarantee.  This is something you're going to be looking at for months/years.  I think it's easily worth it.  It took about 24 hours for it to harden - but now, it's not really noticeable."
Surface,3dnl4a,TormentedSpirit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:41:20 2015 UTC,Former Bby/Geeksquad agent here. The Zagg shield surfaces are rubbery and i'd imagine be a problem if you use the stylus.  Not sure if zagg released an anti-glare version of their surface shield. Those have a smooth finish.   As far as installation goes: If you dont want any air bubbles under the screen have bby do the work. If any air bubbles show up within 30d you can take it back in and have it redone.
Surface,3dnl4a,jakecosenza13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"I've got very little experience with Best Buy and getting screen protectors installed by others but I must add my 2c in screen protector options.   A few months ago I picked up a screen proctor from photodon, who I had never heard of, for my obscure huion gt-220. Pens and screen protectors never mix well unless it's tempered glass, or so I thought. I paid 5 bucks and tested out several of their protectors and ended up getting what's called the 6HS. Anti-scratch, anti-smudge and supposedly a bunch of other things. But best of all it feels like glass, or better in my opinion if that's possible. I put it on my Huion a few months ago and can't imagine ever taking it off. Peace of mind goes a long way.  I already have one on the way for my Sp3 barring any problems with the device. At half the cost of a tempered glass protector I couldn't be happier. I'll have to see if it decreases sensitivity when it arrives. I can't imagine it would. It's incredibly thin."
Surface,3dndve,atkulp,2,Fri Jul 17 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen a pin-out for it, but you can make a few assumptions which should allow you to test for basics. It's bi-directional, in that it works when inserted in either direction. So the assumption would be that the pins on one side are mirrored on the other. There are 6 pins on each side (group of 3 - top, bottom). We know that the SP3 is DC 12V @2.58A input. So two of the pins must be 12v (pos/neg). Try using a multimeter to probe for 12v on the connectors. In sure there's a sensing pin in there too."
Surface,3dndve,nocorvair,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was worried about shorting something.  For example, if one was 12v and one was 5v..."
Surface,3dndve,nocorvair,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:13:38 2015 UTC,"No 5v in the cable. That rating is for the USB port on the transformer itself. You could test that, but that's only half the story - the reason I figured you originally asked."

Surface,3dnmn4,T_GTX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:34:28 2015 UTC,So you went from Windows 8.1 to W10 then to Win 8.1 to Win10 again?    :D  How were you able to keep the recovery partition for Windows 8 during the upgrade to Windows 10?  As in how did you upgrade to Windows 10?  Holding off right now as I want to make sure I can revert to Windows 8.1....
Surface,3dnmn4,T_GTX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:38:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was on 10166, but on that build I couldn't get my apps like Kindle to work and I had a lot of other bugs. I went into advanced start up in order to refresh the PC (or whatever it's called). After that it was restored to how I first purchased it.   The recovery partition remains if you just upgrade from Win8.1 or from a previous W10 preview.   When I upgraded to 10 from a fresh 8.1 I used an ISO of 10240, which can be made from its ESD or found online. If you're on 10166 you can just download 10240 which is the latest W10 available as of now. As long as you don't manually wipe the drive completely you will always have the recovery partition present on the Surface, the W10 installer doesn't format other partitions that are present on the drive.   Almost forgot but I installed Win10 every time by mounting the ISO with right-click instead of using USB drives. Win8.1/10 can both mount ISO files virtually and install programs or operating systems that way."

Win8.1/10 can both mount ISO files virtually and install programs or operating systems that way.   So it sounds like you did an in-place upgrade i.e. you upgraded to Windows 10 from within (as in-running) Windows 8.1. Basically you mounted the ISO in Windows 8 and then ran the executable while in Windows 8.

I then bought one for £6($10 ish) which was a general fabric. Probably lasted 10 months. Problem is, they both deteriorated on the arm strap, which is what you don't want as it could break/tear over time without you noticing - or you think it's OK and that's when it snaps with your surface in it.  I bought a real quality backpack from Wenger - they make the Swiss Army knives, and its fantastic. You'll have a more durable bag with more space and better weight distribution with a backpack.  Otherwise, the second Messenger bag looks hefty and decent quality.   Edit - also being waterproof is important. You're more likely to get a wenger backpack with decent waterproof material - than a Messenger bag, despite leather being what it is, it can saturate easily ( not all have a lasting protection on them ) and fabric saturates easily too."

I won't comment on price, you'll have to figure out if that makes sense to you on your own.   That said, Dragon was the only paid software that I use(d), and it did well for me. I used it in conjunction with office, and it takes a little while to get used to, and a little while to get used to you, and it never reached 100% fidelity with me, but it got closer than anything else I tried. I bought it with a student discount am very happy with it.   With the Surface Pro, I remember it being a little laggy (which might have just been it translating), but it works very well with the pro 3. It recommends that you have a dedicated mic for it (I initially used a cheap logitech skype headset), but I find that if you speak directly into the mic and lean in a bit, the Pro 3's mic will do the job quite nicely.   Suffice to say, no free option I found came close to Dragon in ease of use, features or accurate transcription. As to whether the SP is overkill, maybe? I guess that any midrange laptop should be able to run both dragon and office at the same time. That said, having used Dragon on my desktop as well, it is, if nothing else, more fun to use it with the Surface :P   Anyway, TL;DR version   Dragon Naturally speaking: works on SP3 quite well.

Surface,3dloi3,fallen_seraph,3,Fri Jul 17 07:35:59 2015 UTC,"I read this a bit earlier today and wanted to test some of what you were asking.  I've got a S3 4/128 and absolutely love it.  That being said, as long as you manage expectations, it can be a very versatile device.  As a reader, its great.  I really like the odd resolution in the portrait mode for reading PDFs and other Docs.  There's a lot on the screen at 1280x1920 in portrait mode and it's great for looking at those types of files.  As for gaming, I have not experienced the same shutting down issue the other user mentioned.  I've mostly played Indies and older titles for the most part, though, simply because of limitations in storage space.  Having something like Planescape Torment on the go is rather fantastic.  I did, however, install Civ V and XCOM on my Surface to check them out since you did get me curious.  I'm pleased to report both work very well.  Civ V took some tweaking to get working at a smoother frame rate (25 FPS) and that ended up with most things on low at 1680x1050.  XCOM had a much better auto detection and ran at 30 FPS with most things on low and at 1280x800.  What's really fun to play with are the touch settings on both games.  Civ V has an option for touch controls in the launcher, and XCOM detected the touch screen and popped up an option to use touch from the main menu.  The touch controls for both games seem to work quite well.  As long as you're not expecting to max them out at 1920x1280 and can play at a lower frame rate than what you're seeing on your desktop, the Surface 3 seems to work well as a portable gaming system.  I've uninstalled Civ to free the space back up, but will very likely keep XCOM installed and keep playing it through my Surface even though it eats up 1/5th of my storage space.  EDIT:  I should also mention that the FMV sequences for Civ V run fine, but are incredibly jerky for XCOM.  Not sure if there's a setting that can fix that for XCOM, but it's only the movies that are problematic."
Surface,3dloi3,stlobus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:42 2015 UTC,The touch controls for both is something I've wanted to try out and one reason I mentioned those. Also great to see a fellow Torment fan.  On another note I did find a Pro 3 i3 version refurbished at same price as normal Surface 3: http://m.newegg.ca/Product/index?itemnumber=34-735-047 Is that a good option or will the hard drive storage bite me in the ass/I've heard the i3 one doesn't run great.
Surface,3dloi3,stlobus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:55:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that 64 GB of storage mean you'll likely have just under 50 GB of storage for yourself to use for whatever.  If you find yourself installing something like XCOM, that one game will be almost half of your available space.  With the Surface being more of an extremely portable computer and less of a tablet like an iPad, I would have a hard time recommending only 64 GB of space.  Torment with the Widescreen and Improved UI mods is fantastic on the Surface.  Here's a link to a good guide for the mods if you haven't used these.  http://www.gog.com/news/mod_spotlight_planescape_torment_mods_guide"

Which is a good way of seeing how much it has been used.  You will want to check to make sure the usb port and the micro sd charge slot. Make sure the device can recognize these devices and will read/write to them.    If there is a pen included make sure it works by trying to write someone on the surface. I would also try connecting to a wifi to be sure that works.  I would also try turning it on and shutting it down just to make sure its not taking longer then it should.  As for wiping the device there is an option to reset to factory default which will let you do a full wipe.   I would also ask the guy if he has registered the sp3 serial number under his Microsoft account. If the device is older then a year it will have no warranty. If the device is less then a year old it will have a 1 year warranty so if it breaks your gonna want to be able to register the surface under your account to send in for repairs.

I've been using the SP3 for my school work and I love it for that. OneNote is wonderful and I actually prefer typing on the SP3.  I was already pretty familiar with windows so changing platforms didn't really have an impact on me. The operating systems are very similar so if you're relatively tech savvy I don't you'll have any problems with the transition.  When it comes to Photoshop, I think you'll want Photoshop CC 2015 over CS6. CC is designed to work better with the touch screen and has proper drivers the surface pen. My biggest gripe with drawing on the SP3 is that the keyboard gets in the way and I end up pressing keys with my wrist/forearm.

However, weight, lack of USB charging, no tablet type functionality, no pen, non-retina MacBook Air combined with the flexibility of the Surface line with micro SD, USB 3.0, touch, pen, etc, etc. drew me in.

Still, having pen input on screen like a Cintiq is very desirable."
Surface,3diz1z,dylan_the_wizard,2,Fri Jul 17 03:07:33 2015 UTC,"I switched in a similar position to you - from an iMac & Macbook Air to Win7 Desktop and SP3, and I think it's wonderful.   I originally loved the OSX line because of device compatibility (I also own an iPhone) and clean design but Windows has caught up dramatically in the last few years, and compatibility of Adobe programs (I use Ps, Lr, Id & Il mostly, along with lots of CAD applications) has really helped. I haven't tried W10 to be fair, but have read a lot and the outlook is promising.   As far as performance goes, the Win7 Desktop far outstrips the iMac with high-end dedicated cards, which is glorious for 3D rendering and Solidworks apps, and can be much easier to repair in the future, for peace of mind. I also use a Wacom tablet for concept sketching and pen input is just as good in Windows, so long as you stay within mainstay graphical programs like Ps that support pressure points.   I have relatively few gripes with Windows 7 compared to OSX, such as language switching being awkward, the more awkward program installing (the apps aren't all neatly stored in a single Applications folder) and use of ""Win 7 Libraries"", though I don't know if that's been removed for Win10.   Comparing the Macbook Air to SP3 however, it's a slightly different story. Mostly due to thermal throttling the Macbook outstrips the SP3 in power applications (and this is a Macbook from 2011). I'm not surprised or annoyed by this, as I give all the heavy lifting tasks to the desktop PC and the SP3 is mostly for portable presentations and work on the go. The Wacom tablet I used was roughly the same size as the SP3, and it might be that i'm used to using the tablet with a separate display, but I don't like drawing for long periods on the SP3 display. It can get hot (where as the Wacom is cold) and though it's nice, the glossy screen isn't as ideal for drawing as a matte finish drawing tablet. The 256/2048 pressure difference is hardly noticeable, but this may be my drawing style.   That being said, it's far lighter and thinner than the Macbook, and I much prefer bringing it around, especially with the type cover - it looks more like a traditional legal pad than a laptop. Syncing work files between the desktop and SP3 (Which I need to do at the end of every work session) is much easier than between the two Macs. The combination of the Desktop and SP3 feels much more like a ""Main PC"" and ""mobile companion"" than two separate computers, as is with the iMac and Macbook.   Feel free to ask any questions."
Surface,3diz1z,tcpipman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:16:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that was very helpful. Particularly your insights on the feel of a wacom versus drawing on the glass screen of a sp3. I'll really have to try it first."
Surface,3diz1z,lostinstl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:30:18 2015 UTC,"I've always been a windows user and switched to a 13"" macbook pro about a year and a half ago for web development (pretty much all modern dev tools work best on osx).  The computer itself is fine, the <2ghz processor wasn't a big deal because it would just end up turboboosted a lot of the time anyway and the speed is on par with most other ultrabooks. The pen is great, very accurate for drawing and writing. I had an older version of photoshop (CS6) and couldn't get pressure sensitivity to work, since the n-trig website disappeared, so I wasn't able to play with photoshop much. But in other programs the pressure curve was good, so I assume it would be fine in PS too.  The main issue I had with it, and the reason I returned it and went back to using my macbook, was problems with windows itself, mainly scaling. As you know, you NEED scaling to work with the SP3's high dpi screen. The problem is that until windows 10, you can only set one scaling level at a time, so everything on a regular monitor would be miniscule. Even with being able to set it per-monitor in win10, it still functions very very poorly, and you end up with a lot of blurry apps. Even microsoft's own skype app is HORRIBLE on a high-dpi screen, it's basically unusable on a surface - you have to use the metro version, which they just phased out! what a clusterfuck there  One other thing is that there are a lot of great value-add apps in osx. For very basic note taking (like making grocery lists, or just typing quick notes), I really hate the way OneNote works compared to the osx notes app. The built-in mail app is approximately 10000000x better than the windows 10 mail app (when it works at all, its still very crashy). The calendar is much better on osx. And of course the whole iLife suite that is free, which I don't use much but is mentally nice to know you can fall back on in case my cracked software stops working :P  All that said I still highly recommend trying it out. If you get it from amazon or best buy, you can return it for a full refund if you don't like it. I'm probably going to pick up another one in the near future to see if MS has fixed scaling issues with recent win10 updates."

My original plan was to purchase a MacBook Air, but the screen resolution made me second guess that decision. I really like the Mac OS, but after making the switch, there is really not much I miss.  I mainly do web development (.net, python, ruby), and have not had any issues with the transition. All of the tools I use have a Windows equivalent, I only needed to learn the keyboard shortcuts.  Performance is what I expected, although the battery life could be a little better.   I rarely use the start menu, and use the search menu on Windows 10 to find what I'm looking for. Windows 10 has been very smooth so far, and seems to be a great release.   The only thing I do miss is the ability to run virtual machines, but have started to use cloud based VM's instead. Since I have an internet connection available wherever I go, this has not been a problem.  I have the i7/256gb model  And the screen is beautiful"

What if the pro 4 specs were going to be pushed by multiple partners. It may become an entire family once windows 10 is out. The Surface line was built to create a proper windows tablet when manufactory rs weren't. They may have agreed to do it with Windows 10 now that microsoft showed them up with a successful Surface pro 3.  Just a thought...

Vista they did some graphics update,  but consumer demand their years few year old computer to be able to run it smoothly.  It's never the case before,  every edition of windows grew in both size and system requirement, windows 7 maintain size and requirement. By this time those computers that can't run Vista is probably all dead.   Windows 8 design changes was probably a response to raise of iPhone and iPad.  Of course they over do it.  Windows 10 would correct it.  Vista shows they can't stick to a tested of yesteryear and repeat,  consumer demand is ever changing. Changing demand is why they are always trying to change ui or so design to respond to market. Without test and update there won't be any ""good' version of windows."

There are some caveats however, my i3 SP3 usually lasts about 6-8 hours before it shuts down so if you're doing any heavier tasks you wont be able to make it to 8 hours.  Photoshop may also be an issue. It will manage basics tasks just fine, but if you're working with several 40-50 MP files the 4GB of RAM won't cut it.

Hoping to get a few bucks for my Asus on CraigsList, but no takers so far...  Edit to Add:  I also just bought a Slingbox M1 so when I'm traveling I can watch TV/DVR Recordings, etc., from my home system by WiFi.

Surface,3dholo,NoMoreIllusions,2,Fri Jul 17 04:44:01 2015 UTC,"Kind of a different take on your question...  I've had several Android tablets.  I would buy one thinking ""Man this will be useful"" then a couple months of collecting dust, sell it.  Get another one ""Imagine all the things I can do at work with this"".  then a couple months of collecting dust, sell it.  I've probably repeated this 5 or more times now.  What I like about the Surface 3 is that it can do what I consider productivity tasks.  I can use my work software on it, I can use whatever browser I want, I can do pretty much anything that I'd normally carry around a laptop for.  So far, it has been a great companion device for me, far so more than any Android tablet I had used in the past.  That said...  The app selection sucks.  Must of the time I end up just doing what I want in a browser instead of getting an actual app.  You say you listen to podcasts, well there isn't any good podcast apps available.  PocketCasts is available for Windows Phone but not for the Surface, and it is getting pretty bad reviews anyway.  The app store is pretty thin, you might want to check for your ""must-have"" apps before just jumping ship.  All in all though, I wouldn't trade back.  I can actually get stuff done with my Surface and that far outweighs the convenience of a large app market of Google or Apple to me."

The search bar seems to just search for keywords from the whole Microsoft website. Unless it's just the Surface and Windows tablets that have a built-in app store that has a much better interface that I'm unable to see through a computer, the app store just seems very poor.

The battery started crapping out super fast and I went from using it as a daily driver for browsing, YouTube, games, and ebooks, to only using it for ebooks as it couldn't handle much else. I was looking at replacing it with another android tablet but after reading up on this new fancy surface 3 product I decided to check it out in person. I immediately saw the benefits of the surface over another android consumption device. So I decided on the 4gb RAM model with the keyboard.  I now do everything I did on my nexus plus 200% more. Its full on windows os, vs the limited but able android os. I've been making art with the pen, recording music with Reaper, editing go pro video, and everything thing else I was doing with the nexus.

Now my Nexus 7 is starting to get a bit wonky; I'm not sure if it's because of the new Lollipop update or Asus products just have poor longevity. Honestly, I didn't see much purpose for a tablet, it was just a bigger phone to me. The main reason I picked up my Nexus 7 was because I got it cheap due to a pricing mistake. The versatility of the Surface devices have definitely gotten me interested in them. Seems like all the responses so far are very positive, and any negatives are minimum and negligible.  Thanks!"

For people like me, who want a sp3, but for various reasons (such as missed sales) haven't actually purchased one, this could make it even less likely that they'd get one.   Because now I have to debate, is it better to get a surface pro 3 now/when a good sale pops up, or should I wait until they tell us more about the sp4? If I wait, and they don't announce anything until September, I will have most likely missed the 'best' back to school sales.   Similarly if I purchase one now, and then in September we find out the  sp4 is going to be better in (almost) every way and minimally more expensive (if at all depending on model) then I'm going to feel like I've wasted the money on the sp3."

My MBP slowed down significantly the past few months and to be honest, its weight became an issue (I'm a tiny girl - carrying the MBP in my backpack to and from school everyday was causing me a lot of back pain). I spent the first half of the summer obsessively researching what new laptop I should get. Honestly, I had never heard of the Surface till I started researching laptops, but it blew me away. Watched a lot of YouTube reviews, played with one at Best Buy, talked to a few computer geeks in my family...everything pointed in the direction of getting one. So I finally got the SP3/256GB/8RAM about 6 weeks ago and I seriously could not be happier. Making the switch from MBP to SP3 was not hard at all once you learn the shortcuts. I love the touch screen and I use the SP3 in tablet mode a lot more than I thought I would. The pen is phenomenal and I love the practicality of OneNote. My MBP is still up and running (gave it to my little sister) but I haven't touched it since I got the SP3. Let me know if you have any questions, would be more than happy to elaborate."

You won't be able to get the guarantee of returning it but it will be a better deal. Also, its covered with drop protection.  http://m.ebay.com/itm/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-3-128GB-With-Keyboard-With-Complete-Warranty-/261962631155?nav=SEARCH  The reason I suggest this is because first its the most expensive computer I have ever bought and second I bought a i5 256gb with Microsoft compete care for $900. Unfortunately, I ordered a blue Surface pen off amazon because I didn't think he included one with the purchase.  I actually purchased a i5 256gb with the keyboard from the Microsoft Store for about $1400 with the student discount. So, I'm definitely going to be returning it as soon as I get the one I ordered."

Surface,3detao,zmast,5,Wed Jul 15 18:37:51 2015 UTC,Writing larger zoomed in is the way to go. Seems that most people use around 150%-200% zoom and I have seen mention of .35 thickness working best. It really works fine once you get going.  I have had a few hiccups doing calculus but for the most part it works well enough.
Surface,3detao,Akselmusic,0,Wed Jul 15 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this. I like being able to see a large portion of my workspace, whether I'm programming, typing up a report, taking notes, or just browsing a text-heavy website such as Reddit. The Surface's high resolution screen makes it so that text won't be blurry even if I make it tiny, which is a big plus since it lets me fit a lot more on the screen at once. But if I need to zoom in to write and you have to constantly scroll around to see everything, my productivity tanks.  To be honest, I don't know how the pen performs on the Surface 3. I have the original Surface Pro, and I can take notes with small letters without issues--it's almost as good as writing on paper. I do hear that while Ntrig is more accurate and doesn't have edge issues, it has some jitter issues."
Surface,3detao,poopyheadthrowaway,4,Wed Jul 15 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"I never have it zoomed in when I'm typing or browsing something. That makes no sense and doesn't really seem to be applicable here since the question is about handwriting without the keyboard.   Zooming is the common answer when the question comes up about handwriting on the SP3. I have had success zoomed in a little for HANDWRITING. Not general browsing/typing.  Although I have heard the SP1 performs better for writing unzoomed than the SP3. I also think there is just a bit of a curve to just get used to it so someone just starting may have a hard time. I regularly take notes unzoomed but zooming for more complicated stuff like calc is helpful.    Ultimately it is an individual preference that you can probably get used to either way. I definitely don't find that zooming slows me down since I'm not so close that I can only write a few words at a time. Plus then when I zoom out my notes are small, tight and cleanly detailed afterwards."
Surface,3detao,Akselmusic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:23:33 2015 UTC,"Technically, you do zoom in by setting the UI scaling. For example, I use 100% scaling on my SP1 so I can see more of everything (even if it's a bit smaller). You can also zoom in/out or make text bigger/smaller in IDEs or MS Office.  But anyway, yeah, zooming in works for many people, just not for me (and perhaps not for OP), largely because having to constantly scroll around is not as convenient as being able to see everything at a glance. And it could very well be true that there's just a learning curve when writing with Ntrig."
Surface,3detao,poopyheadthrowaway,3,Wed Jul 15 19:34:09 2015 UTC,"Everyone does exactly that: zoom in One Note (desktop version because it's better), write large, zoom out. It isn't impractical at all.  Here's an example of my notes:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/4gjvtvwpgtyfcik/killme.png?dl=0"

Surface,3detao,Domino584,3,Wed Jul 15 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard people have sensitivity issues with the S3/SP3.  Just increase the pen sensitivity and it'll change things.  I never noticed any issues on the SP3 per-say, but the S3 might have some issues.  From experience on my SP2, the pen is no where near as accurate as the SP3, and the digitizer in the SP3 is the same as the S3.  For note taking, make sure you use line breaks that are natural to writing (i.e. same thickness to your paper).  The rest is muscle memory and technique (i.e use the pen as a guide but follow the crosshair for any precision; this is less of an issue on the SP3).  On the contrary, pairing the SP2 with an ACER Wacom pen, the pen accuracy is now on par, if not the same as the SP3."

As far as practical use goes, it's super portable and the pen will allow you to draw directly on the unit without the need for a seperate drawing tablet.

They always seem overly expensive to me, but then again, they are the real juggernaut of the digital art world as far as art tablets go. Their pen, in my opinion, is the best thing about the Cintiq. And I find myself missing tilt sensitivity a bit with what I ended up doing.  What I ended up deciding on was basically both. Instead of going for a Cintiq I went a cheap Chinese alternative. The Huion Gt-220. Which, I feel, performs just as well as any Cintiq product I've gotten to test. (It helps it's only around 800 new.) Granted there's no tilt sensitivity, the drivers take some tweaking, there are no hot keys and you have to buy a custom screen protector if you want the matte finish. (I love painting/sculpting on glass so I don't mind) But other wise it's performed fantastically over the several hundred hours I've used mine. I honestly believe the screen is richer and more vibrant the Cintiq's I've seen. But eh, could be my bias.   Just some food for thought.  I'm still waiting to grab my Surface. I'm stuck in the whole ""Do I jump in now or try to wait and see if the surface 4 is going to come out soon"" loop.   I was lucky enough to test one out a few weeks ago and it felt... pretty fantastic honestly. No real gripes about the pen. Didn't really notice the sensitivity difference. It felt different than my main set up mostly because I use custom pressure curves in Lazy Nezumi for sketching/painting.  As for dimensions it's obviously not a 22-inch screen that I've gotten spoiled on but the whole device is 11.5in x 7.9in it's not incredibly tiny. I mostly sketch on a 8.5 x 11 sketch pad so it didn't feel like a huge change for me.  Granted you have to think about what program you're going to use. I spend a lot of time doing figure drawing and sketching up concepts in Mischeif which has a low profile UI and an infinite canvas.   All in all I'm set on getting an i5 with 8gigs of ram. Since I usually paint in Photoshop which, as we all know, is a ram hog.  So that's pretty much my 2c. I loved the test run I got of the SP3 and never noticed any real lag or sensitivity problems. I'd honestly love for it to be 14inches instead of 12 but that's just because I don't run around a lot and more screen space is always welcome."
Surface,3df1uk,tecton1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:41:09 2015 UTC,"I second the above (tormented spirit) opinion. For $2000 get a Huion as already mentioned (they just released some new models) and a surface pro. Best of both worlds.   Hot keys will only be missed if you either hate keyboard shortcuts or only work in 1 or two programs. As I move around 6 or 7 different art apps I find the keyboard much more convenient.   Size of the SP3 is quite reasonable, maybe go and play on a display model to see if you like it.  Rather than dropping $2000 on a cintiq in one hit you can space it out over time if needed..get the huion or sp3 first, whichever you would use most, get a feel for it and then get the other later.  If you want to make 2d concept art an i5 4-8gb is all you need. The rest is technique. If you wanted to bring in some 3d an i5 will be ok for small things modeling is fine, but fans will run/ heat up a lot when you render. The i7 has a better gpu but again it'll get hot on larger scenes/models during renders.  Cintiqs do feel like luxury items but at the end of the day it's just a tool, having a fancy pen case won't make you more talented.  Best bang for buck is huion and sp3."

It came out to like $44 after shipping (I don't have Prime), but it was the best one I could find and I really like having it around so my Surface isn't just naked. It fits the pen on the inside as well as ~4-5 business cards. There's also a pocket on the back to hold some loose paper if you'd like.  I will say that it is a little snug at first (pun not intended) and it creased the little fabric on the outside of my type cover, but it bent back naturally and hasn't been doing it since the first few days.

To those who don't have pro, get this deal! When pro 4 comes out, it'll be $1000 or 900. So basically you're paying $2-300 less. It's really up to you to decide. Is 2-$300 worth extra for pro 4?"

That Sandisk 128GB is pretty slow though, but if all I do is store movies on it, no biggie. But at $60 for 128GB microSD, it's hard to complain when it's from a reputable company.   My biggest concern about the SP4 is that it will be using a CoreM. I didn't get the Surface 3 due to issues of processor power, so for MS to switch to a better battery life, but weaker performance (Macbook 2015s are benchmarking worse than Macbook 2011s for this reason), is a real concern. But the SP4 may never see the light to day. As for the back to school deals, $200 off I think is the best a non-student like me can ever hope for. Some students have been able to pair the $200 off at Bestbuy with a $100 student discount. That's a killer deal. Too bad I've been out of college for years."

Surface Pro's have been on a sale rollercoaster this entire year honestly. You could probably get windows central on an rss feed or something to help notify you when one happens. They do a pretty good job of keeping up on all the relevant sales.    Side note: Holy... Just 2 weeks ago they added a new model. i7 for the price of the i5. Only downside being less harddrive which hardly matters. 100% I would have gotten that if it was available when I bought mine. (I have the 256gb i5)

Just hard to turn away from the best buy sale right now, since if people are right and the student discount stacks with it I could get the i5 256 +keyboard for about $1225, while the base price of just  the i7/128gb is $1299..."

Surface,3dchst,cuongfu,-3,Thu Jul 16 02:47:07 2015 UTC,Why would anyone return a product for something like this. These systems are so integrated that for the most part a failure of a discreet internal component is not possible without a total failure of the device. Did you not think to try a restart before heading straight back to the store to complain? I don't know how Microsoft hasn't gone bankrupt in North America with the number of posters here that seem to return products on a hair trigger. I have had the same issue once since owning my S3 since release. A restart fixed it so it was obviously a driver glitch. The drivers are maintained so this will be updated.

Restarting my device did not fix it the first time around, and after trying to troubleshoot through the screeching noise that could be heard outside of my house, and contacting microsoft online who told me they had no idea and they would just replace it for free, it seemed like the best option. The people in the store confirmed it was most likely and issue with the device itself after looking at it.   But that's okay you sound like an expert."

You can get connectors with a standard plug to plug them into your transformer of choice.  I have had one DOA transformer, but at about 10-20USD each, did not care. The ones that worked have not given me any trouble. And I have about five.  I have also had a batch of connectors with reversed magnetic polarity so that it would jump out of the port. I doubt this is common. Treat the connectors as consumables. Both the clone and genuine ones fall apart over time. I haven't seen any difference in their rates of wear between genuine and clone.

Without a cap it would just run at a higher framerate and keep the GPU loaded, but with a cap it can run at lower power and allow the GPU and chassis to cool down a bit.  edit: You can see at the end of the power graph the 'FPS limited line' even spikes above the 'no limit' line, which is probably throttling by that point."

The surface team has managed to stay really tight lipped... Unlike certain iPad teams... It has been speculated that it will launch in conjunction with win10.

Make sure to download the Surface app from the store so you can customize the buttons on the pen and the sensitivity.  The pen is killer. I took notes in Operating Systems with it and OneNote (it's faster to type most of the time for me, but there was just a lot of diagrams where it's obvious much harder to type). I also got Drawboard PDF half off and highlighted and annotated PDFs of class readings using it. The default PDF app is okay, but Drawboard has highlighting and colors.  Yes, you'll get Windows 10."

Surface,3dc4i5,green-onion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:23:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, OneNote is cool. You can import PDFs directly into it and mark them up there if you don't want to use a separate app.  The way it works right now is you 'reserve' Windows 10 on Windows 7 or 8/8.1 and on July 29 or shortly thereafter, you'll be able to upgrade. The process is supposed to be like getting a service pack if you've done that before, so time-consuming but not difficult. The default is to upgrade in place, which keeps your stuff. You can wipe after upgrading if you want, that's what I'm doing, but I guess if you just got it you probably won't have a lot of stuff."

I've never had a case where it ran down while plugged in.  It does take a long time to charge--but honestly that hasn't been a real issue.  I am conscientious about plugging it in to charge when I am not using it.  Now I'm curious if I put it at 100% CPU load and max screen brightness whether the stock charger will keep up...

I don't do anything crazy on mine, but I was doing some work the other day and it was at ~10% battery life, I plugged it in, and an hour later I was at 6%...I have to imagine I was pushing it harder than it could recharge, but 99% of the time that's not the case, and I use it plugged in without issue.  Would I recommend it? Absolutely. I prefer my Surface 3 to my iPad Mini, iPad Air, Samsung Galaxy Tab S, Nexus tablets, and even my old Surface Pro 2 and Surface Pro 3 (I've sold all my previous tablets/Surfaces, for one reason or another).

Surface,3da3d2,lyndy650,3,Wed Jul 15 05:57:10 2015 UTC,"I picked up a Surface Pro 3 on launch day as well, but I had a bunch of issues with it. Of course my issues were likely isolated to just me, but the things that I had some concerns over:   Writing with the pen, near the center of the screen, caused it to bow in slightly (and occasionally creak). The size, while I very much enjoyed it over my Surface Pro 2 (which is the reason I sold it, due to being too small for desktop use, for me personally), was slightly unwieldy. The throttling...this happened to me constantly, and became aggravating after awhile. The machine would constantly, spontaneously turn off, for no reason, once or twice a week. At the point it started doing this I was already annoyed, and was looking into alternatives, so I just wrote it off at that point.   Since then, work purchased me a laptop, and I returned to using my desktop full-time for the most part. I did deeply miss writing notes, and that kind of thing, so when they announced a slightly smaller 4:3 ratio x86 powered Surface, I was intrigued. The only complaint I have, not of Microsoft or the Surface at all, is the Canadian pricing hurt. $769.99 for the 128 GB Surface 3, and $159.99 for the keyboard cover. Painful.  All-in-all, after more or less owning all the Surface variants (except the Surface Pro 1, and Surface 2), the Surface 3 is the best configuration for me in my existing situation. It can handle system administration work without issue, battery life is quite good, and can actually do practical things that I felt were too hard to achieve on an iPad or Android tablet. It's not the most realized tablet, but it's just what I was looking for (Netflix, touch web browser).  Sorry for the long winded response! Happy to answer any other questions you may have."

It took a long time to charge while being used and if you weren't using the supplied charger it sometimes wouldn't work at all.

Surface,3da3d2,hxkclan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"You probably had the wrong expectations of the USB charging.Yes, you always have a USB cable lying around, but it's not that easy. To get it to charge you must put in more charge than you use. To do that you need a charger with enough amps. To get solid charging rates you really need to plug it in the wall.   Yes you can charge it using a simple usb cable, but you would probably have to turn the device off to get it to charge."
Surface,3da3d2,Gogogodzirra,3,Tue Jul 14 21:05:15 2015 UTC,"Microsoft set the expectations that you would be able to charge the tablet conveniently. It's not like the only issue with the charging is that you couldn't charge while using it via a computers USB port or something, the problem is the charging is poor using anything but the supplied charger. 2 amp chargers plugged into the wall weren't good enough, and anything higher than that is just hard to find and completely removes the whole point of using micro-usb. If I need to carry around their wall charger as opposed to using wall chargers that are already in many locations then it is no better than a proprietary charger.  The fact that I would have the screen at 1/4 brightness, plugged into a wall charger that charges at 2amps, and still have the computer battery run down while it was charging is a problem, not with expectations, but with the product."

Interestingly enough, this has never happened to me, even whilst playing light games. I'm assuming that this only happens when people used an undervolted charger, such as one which their phone would use.  Recently though, I did have an instance where my S3 didn't charger over night, but I believe shutting in down entirely before charging it fixes the issue. Also, I would recommend buying a Surface Pro 3 if you plan on using Photoshop unless you are doing very light work."

Surface,3da3d2,Wobbling,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:14:21 2015 UTC,Micro usb still works well for android devices ie you can use them while they charge. On the surface 3 it was the wrong choice. They should have stuck with the magnetic charger or waited for usb c which can actually handle the power draw.
Surface,3da3d2,SMeekWoodworks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:41:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed - I've found that micro-USB charging works fine with Android tablets; the supply can charge it while you use.  I respect Microsoft's attempt to give us something universal in this low-power tablet; micro-USB is just, as you say, the wrong tool. It might be adequate for the kind of energy that ARM chips draw in on OSes specifically written for them, but clearly not for the-little-chip-that-could Atoms being pushed on Windows.  That said, when this model was in development, I guess there weren't any other mainstream options. Now USB-C will probably be a better fit, and it'd make sense to include that on any future successor."

Maybe you should buy a gaming laptop, the S3 certainly isn't one? maybe an SP3 is more suited to your needs. Most people I talk about the S3 with are pleasantly surprised that it can do light PC gaming at all.   This is a reasonable expectation for an atom-powered tablet.  The comparison to an iPad is also flawed. Well, unless this is happening to you when you just run Windows Store apps? Is that what you are saying, /u/myanusisseeping?"
Surface,3da3d2,freon,2,Fri Jul 17 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"I have been having charging issues with mine. Usually, the first time I plug it in, it says ""Plugged in- Not charging"". This is even when using the actual S3 charger. I've had it be completely decharged in the morning, and other times I've left it plugged in for hours. It has been driving me nuts.  That said, I still love this thing! I almost never use my laptop anymore. I may just need to return it for a warranty replacement."
Surface,3da3d2,estydees,2,Wed Jul 15 00:11:11 2015 UTC,I know many people are saying it's not a big deal. But if you see this. I actually just treturned my S3 and got the SP3 today during the flash sale (i5 was $800). The charging really takes a long time.
Surface,3da3d2,oscillating000,2,Wed Jul 15 04:26:51 2015 UTC,"I'm having the charging issue, and it is as you fear. Battery won't charge while plugged in and force powers off at 0% battery. I would not recommend the tablet at this time. https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/3dcxkt/surface_3_dreaded_charging_issues/"
Surface,3da3d2,oscillating000,2,Wed Jul 15 08:03:22 2015 UTC,"I've had the S3 since release date and use it as my daily ""lap""top. The battery does take a long time to charge (and even longer if you don't use the included 2.5amp charger) One would typically think well it must have a very large battery, but it doesn't....  Anyways, the battery actually lasts quite a while and is VERY efficient when in sleep mode. During the weekends when I'm not using it as much I can easily make it to Monday with 50%+ without plugging it in.  Speaking of plugging it in that is another annoyance, the charger doesn't sit flushed when its plugged in and sometimes I have to double check to make sure its charging. I personally really liked the magnetic charger, it was intuitive and easy to use. But I understand why they changed it, though I wish they had left it as an option.   The S3 also has intermediate WiFi issues at times, since I've owned it (May 5th) I've had to reboot the device to correct it around 4 times. And on occasion it will hang during a restart and I have to hard boot it down. Though Microsoft is continuously rolling out updates and I think their support has really come a long ways, kudos to them.  Outside of that I have really enjoyed the S3. I had a SP3 before but it was too big and heavy and got hotter than I wanted for what its intended use was for. This has been the perfect package and am expecting Windows 10 to complete it. I use the Pen daily and it was one of the ""must haves"" for me.  I know I've mainly said complaints but I really would give it 8.9 out of 10 so far. Its light, fast, has expandable storage and runs full fledged Windows.  Spending $100 more on more hard drive capacity and double the ram is a must imo. Good luck to you!"
Surface,3da3d2,Wobbling,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:39:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing. Sounds like this is how most owners feel - the charging problems can be a noticeable pain but they can look past them because of the (pretty awesome) benefits of the machine as a whole.
Surface,3da3d2,Colt4587,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:13:13 2015 UTC,This is a Surface 3 issue or possible one anyway the SP3 doesn't have this issue.    I don't mind the long charging time I would be worried that if I plug it in and I'm using it for basic web browsing then it would bother me if it wouldn't charge or at least maintain.    This wouldn't even be a thing if they just went with a dedicated proprietary charger to late to fix that unless they come out with a refresh.    Seems this is hit or miss some are having issues some aren't consensus is that it takes a while to charge which I'm ok with.
Surface,3da3d2,Colt4587,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:02:08 2015 UTC,Exactly how I feel. I wonder if it's on the Surface team's radar so they'd try fix it for a refresh. If not everybody's having a problem maybe they won't be aware of it or see a need to address it.
Surface,3dbs69,bearses,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:18:22 2015 UTC,IE is slow so I use firefox most of the time. You only have to deal with it for 2 more weeks then you can try out edge on Win 10.
Surface,3dbs69,DominusVenturae,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:35:26 2015 UTC,"IE is lightning fast compared to chrome on the surface 3 and surface pro. I did some comparisons. Chrome scrolls very choppy on both but better on the pro. IE 11 takes far less cpu than chrome does on both machines, I'm talking a significant amount. IE is smooth chrome borders on unusable on the surface 3. I'm surprised you're seeing IE run slow at all because chrome was really bad and firefox was the absolute worst."
Surface,3dbs69,3DXYZ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:53:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, Chrome has its problems for sure. Especially with CPU. My task manager goes nuts when Chrome is open. But IE is downright unusable for me at the moment. I'm on a fresh install, too. I was experiencing a lot of device problems, so I restored the computer a couple days ago."
Surface,3dbs69,3DXYZ,2,Wed Jul 15 03:02:14 2015 UTC,"This is really odd to me. For me IE is so smooth its insane. Are you running any kind of plugins or anything odd? Is there anything at all you have added to the equation? It really should be ultra smooth. What pages are you going to? I'll compare on my own although I have a Surface 3 Pro now, as I returned the Surface 3 since I wanted a bit more cpu. I did a side by side comparison of both devices and chrome is brutal on both systems, and it really killed the surface 3, barely useable and too much cpu. IE on the other hand was just ultra smooth on both even while scrolling pages that video playing on them like youtube or twitch. What sites are you testing on? I can try them myself. Something has to be odd.  Also you may want to look into host file blocking so you can kill all the ads and junk. http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm  BTW If you bought this device recently, you may want to exchange it if you cant figure this out because IE should be very smooth. You can watch comparison videos of surface 3 vs surface pro and see how well it performs then compare it to what you're seeing. For example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZy1t8WcFs"
Surface,3dbs69,3DXYZ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:06:44 2015 UTC,"The only thing I added was the list for adblocking. Are you using tablet mode exclusively, or desktop too? Because Desktop IE is the worse offender for me.  I'm literally just going on google, reddit, and facebook. It's actually crashing occasionally, and having slow reactions to things like opening / closing tabs or clicking links, or even just interacting with the window."
Surface,3dbs69,3DXYZ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:12:38 2015 UTC,"Both were very fast and smooth. I don't know if you replied while I was editing my other comment and missed some of the stuff I added to it but watch this video to compare how yours is performing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvZy1t8WcFs  IF its not anything close to that, you may want to consider returning your device if you still can and you cant figure this out. Let me know if you're seeing anything like that video because you should be."
Surface,3dbs69,3DXYZ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:14:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, I didn't see that. It's fine some of the time, but it has bouts of slowness. It's much worse in desktop, though. Like I said, nearly unusable. Yeah, I've been thinking of returning it. Especially since I'm still experiencing the device issues. Only, I'll be loathe to be without a computer for 5-8 business days."
Surface,3dbs69,3DXYZ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:17:46 2015 UTC,It should be fast most of the time. Do you have a Microsoft store (assuming you bought it from MS) near you that you can take it to? They will exchange it on the spot especially if you show them. Did you watch that video? It should be that smooth most of the time if not all of the time.

Surface,3d94fw,Ansuzalgiz,3,Tue Jul 14 14:23:28 2015 UTC,"So I'm trying to decide between a SP2 and SP3. I have a million questions and the guy at BestBuy wasn't very helpful so I come to you, reddit. Here we go: Why is the SP2 more expensive?  Can I install photoshop, video editing software, and torrent software on either? Should I wait to buy the SP3 until after 7/29 when they release Windows 10? Will they go on sale after that date, do you think? Will this computer hold out for approx 3 years at least?"
Surface,3d94fw,imanygirl,7,Tue Jul 14 14:35:21 2015 UTC,"I'm actually a Microsoft Consultant at Best Buy so I'm sorry for that bad experience, but I'd be happy to answer those questions.  I'm assuming you're asking why the SP3 is more expensive, and honestly I couldn't really tell you. The benefits though include a larger display with a more appropriate aspect ratio for writing notes, and features a MUCH improved kickstand with a full range of motion instead of set placements.  You can install all of that on both with no problem.  You shouldn't wait because there is no reason to. Both devices are going to get W10, and with the SP3, that's a pretty good sale going on right now."

You could totally just do a big ""thermo"" tab or something though. You've got notebooks, tab groups, tabs, pages and subpages to play with for organisation.  Like you said, you can't move around and edit written notes but I often move paragraphs down and add an extra bit or rearranging pages and add new subpages.

And to clarify the second part, Office Lens is always still an option.  However, OneNote on Windows 8 had an ""insert from camera"" option that would perform similar functionality to Office Lens.  For me, this was useful at times because I could import a whiteboard image while not having a Wifi connection (as with Office Lens, I do it with my phone, then that syncs to the cloud, then the cloud version would have to sync down to my Surface).

Surface,3dadsa,2ndtryagain,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:58:53 2015 UTC,agreed. In some ways windows 10 is a step back in the touch ui workflow from windows 8.1 its a shame really. The issues with Edge are mostly that its just behind on development. It should be further along but it seems they were more concerned with meeting the release deadline. At this stage its a very simple browser. Runs very well though. I'm sure once its released they will have the time to resume feature implantation which they probably have been working on but just didn't have time to stabilize for release.

Surface,3d8gwu,Star-Bellied-Sneech,3,Tue Jul 14 12:57:55 2015 UTC,"I find the changes to the handwriting input / tablet input panel to have mixed results.  On the one hand, it's great that if you touch an input box with the pen, it automatically brings up handwriting recognition (and if it's floating / not docked, it puts that right near your hand).  On the other hand, the changes to the way handwriting is recognized are terrible.  In 10, it leaves your writing as ink and you have to tap on the right word in autocorrect.  In Windows 8, it converts on the fly to text.  The difference here is that in 8 you can write out a whole sentence, and make your corrections after the fact (using some great gestures like a vertical line to add more space between letters).  In 10, my experience is that you basically have to write a word, tap on the correct version in autocorrect, then write the next word, tap on its correct version, and so on and so forth.  It's completely unnatural and a huge step back."

Surface,3d519z,ratshack,2,Mon Jul 13 17:36:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe Wacom would respond with a new Cintiq Companion with a keyboard cover system (ala Type Cover) and use of a magnetic power connector and leverage their battery-less tilt and twist recognition pens too (oh and the radial menu and physical buttons on the side of the bezel).  Maybe, Wacom would have a better kickstand system, being more compact and somewhat variable, or having the proper drafting angles and laptop angles.  Possibly a Power cover system too? With illuminated keys...  Since, well, despite the good things about N-Trig, I have wary doubts for it. And Microsoft more and more, opting for a (in my opinion) not as solid of a power contact with MicroUSB or the smaller contacts of the Surface Pro 3's pins, that may affect contact as well, as in shifting while connected.  That's it. I really don't care about the solid hinge laptop paradigm as I pretty much like and use extensively, while typing too, the type cover system and the quick foldability to drawing or tablet browsing and viewing, and manipulating the desktop with OneNote and File Explorer, then back to my Logitech wireless trackball.  It would take a higher, finer resolution of the passive screen for the N-Trig active pen to be ""smoother"" and not like a grid work layout either. Of course, possibly increasing the voltage would make that point source more ""bigger"" for the response of curvature, but in my opinion, it is not as great as the active layer of the EMR screen with Wacom and the passive pen.  Or OEMs would present their refined hybrid options after all this time from being lackluster compared to the Surface Pro lines. Which I noted here when I looked for a device."

Also, disable anything you don't absolutely want on the ""startup"" tab on task manager.

This allows touch as an input, potentially allowing you to pull up your desktop from the couch with the ease of touch gestures that makes sense using a Surface.  I've used it on an Android tablet and it worked great for me in my specific case being a Sound Designer and Composer where my beefy, loud, and often times hot laptop sits at my desk doing all the work with sample libraries and virtual instruments. Meanwhile over at my keyboard, away from my screen, I pull up Splashtop on my tablet and place it on the music stand and instantly make changes just by touching the screen or simply let it give me visual feedback.

Surface,3d6nk2,peatcoal,3,Tue Jul 14 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"When hibernating, the content of the RAM is written to the SSD and power is cut off completely.  So no, processes don't still run in the background. It takes like 15-20 seconds to start back up - it's the same as when it hibernates after 4 hours of being in connected standby.   There's also a way to enable hibernation without disabling connected standby by using the group policy editor. I used it and it works great. See http://www.thetechchat.com/2014/07/14/surface-pro-3-tip-how-to-hibernate-and-keep-instantgo/  Connected standby is useless to me so I've always been looking for a way to replace it with regular sleep, but that doesn't seem to be possible - it's either connected standby or hibernate only.  The bonus of using OP's method to switch to hibernation (Hyper-V method) is that you can use power options and various software solutions to turn the screen off without putting the SP3 into connected standby - if you try any of these with connected standby enabled, it's impossible to turn the screen off and keep programs running (except by connecting an external monitor and disabling the internal display). Even screen off in power options actually always immediately puts the SP3 into connected standby, assuming it's enabled - it seems to be some kind of hardcoded behaviour that screen off always = connected standby."

One of those is rendering small movies shot with GoPro's. In this case its an hour plus video sped up to under 3 minutes . I'm actually impressed with the capabilities of the Surface 3 and the fact it's churning through the video using PowerDirector is impressive. I can even multi-task while it's rendering, very impressed."

Surface,3d50rg,Syde80,8,Mon Jul 13 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"Why does an atom proc have 4 times the L2 cache my i7 SP3 has?   You need to consider the larger context.    The Atom CPU in the S3 is a quad core CPU, each core has a 24KB instruction + 32KB data L1 caches.  Then it has 1MB of L2 cache that is shared between pairs of cores, giving it 2MB total.  The i7 CPU in the SP3 is a dual-core CPU, each core has a 32KB instruction + 32KB data L1 caches, then 256KB L2 cache and then all cores share 4MB a L3 cache.  The architecture is completely different.  You might notice the Atom CPU has a completely lack of L3 cache, as well as a cache that  can be shared with all cores.  Additionally, if you were to compare it on a cache-per core basis, you'll see it quickly paints a very different picture."

I use my iPad in the field, on a couch, on a boat and in a plane :) I need to be able to charge it no matter where I am (USB battery packs or solar) and it needs to be small enough to not be a burden to carry and be usable in small spaces.

Surface,3d50rg,doobist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:59:32 2015 UTC,"I actually bought the Surface 3 first and thought I wanted a smaller one too. Ultimately I found the performance differences to be too big between the two and I couldn't live with the slower surface 3 but I really did like it for all the reasons you mentioned. The surface 3 is newer and the keyboards FN key works a bit differently (better), in that its a toggle unlike the SP3 keyboard. The USB charger just makes sense I agree. Plus the charger itself is smaller and more travel friendly. The S3 chargers prongs fold into it where as the SP3 has actually 2 cables and a charging brick. Its a lot less convenient. Even more so when you factor in you only need to bring one charger for phone, surface etc. SP3 does charge faster though. Overall I felt the Surface 3 wasn't enough cpu for me. It could do most things but photoshop was a bit slow in some areas such as interactivity when adjusting color curves. Chrome also ran terribly but then again chrome runs terrible in general. As for size... The SP3 isn't that much bigger, about an inch. I had both side by side during the return period for the surface 3 and I do like the surface 3 a lot. I didn't feel like it was a bad device at all. I just felt it was more tablet than laptop and I really wanted to replace my laptop so it sounds like you're in the opposite situation and you're probably right the surface 3 is right for you. I liked it for all the same reasons except cpu performance. I wanted a bit more cpu and a real SSD inside."

Surface,3d7t7f,JFHermes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:51:02 2015 UTC,"i5 8GB will suit you well. Fellow designer here.  Using Internet Explorer the Surface Pro 3 is silent for browsing. With Chrome the fan will spin a little, enough to hear it in a silent room.  Chrome will also kill your battery time from 8-9 hours to 4-5.   I've never felt it was noisy as such, but if you push it harder it will spin up relatively quickly. If you push it really hard - for example exporting movies from After Effects or Premiere - then you might want to cool it down extra to not throttle (it'll run hotter than it can when pushing at 100% for minutes. It throttles down to keep cool enough). That's easily done by putting it down on something metal or using a USB fan, but it's a bit of a hack to get around the fact that it's not a great machine for running 100%-CPU for minutes.  Illustrator is a dream, as is Photoshop. The pen works great with both, as long as you have the CC versions (CC 2015 being the best of course). CS6 requires special drivers (wintab).   With the pen you will also change some software habits: I can recommend Mischief as a very nice sketching program, and OneNote as your new best friend. OneNote with a pen is seriously good. Go for the paid (included in Office) desktop version and test it against the free modern version to find which suits you best."

This isn't really a thing 8.1 does better, but I'm annoyed that I have to deal with the sacrifices because of their unified design; I can't customize one start menu without it affecting the other, so if I fill it up with desktop programs that are unusable with touch then they take space away from apps that are suited for tablet mode, and vice versa. If I disable the snap assistant that gives you a choice of apps to snap then it's disabled both in tablet mode, and in desktop mode. I just want to disable it in desktop mode alone.  Maybe the big update for 10 called redstone IIRC will fix my issues, but for now I'm sticking with 8.1."

Surface,3d4ojz,ptrkhh,3,Mon Jul 13 20:21:01 2015 UTC,"I recommend not doing it until you hear others are using it successfully. In general you should never update to a new OS without consulting your IT department (work or school). I know many students are off right now, but in my summer classes I've actually not been able to use popular education software well at all. Somehow this is really not as seamless as the upgrade from 7 to 8 was. I ran the preview builds for 8 all through my classes with very little issue, and here we have 10 introducing hiccups on legacy programs.   Many 8.1 apps are broken, even Microsoft's own new apps, if that's a concern of yours. The developers will need time to update their apps. The new Windows mail hasn't been syncing properly for many of us in over a week. The Word preview pastes Chinese text into browser dialogue boxes. For 3rd parties I care about: drawboard is unfortunately a bit of a mess, mysms is flat out not working.   The Mcgraw Hill education suite barely works. Tegrity recorder has a hell of a time working, have to swap between chrome and traditional IE for different things.   Respondus Lockdown browser takes over 10 minutes to launch. I assumed it was broken so I was loading up an alternative PC to get an exam done yesterday, but right as I had it all ready to go on that one it loaded. Took the test just fine but yeah, things are just very glitchy. Will freeze your computer if you launch it while in tablet mode. Did not have this issue on the prior win 10 build.   Because they removed the right click/swipe down/charms menus, a lot of apps are having issues working with sharing screenshots to One Note. Hamburger menu is the only way to do it and that means getting through sometimes 4 menus to get to screenshot--and that's not a clipping, it's a full-screen screenshot. Really annoyed trying to take notes on it. The desktop version screenclipping is only working occasionally.   I use a lot of bluetooth devices and the connection is shoddy. Have to restart bluetooth often.   So... No! As a student who's been using the last few builds extensively, I've got to say I would not recommend 10166 to anyone. I have a little faith though because the build before this one was working a lot better. It's not all doom and gloom, but they were acting like 10166 is a potential RTM candidate. Eh. Not a good call IMO."

I'm told that Google is using an outdated protocol and they will need to update before Edge can use it as a default search. Because it's Google and Microsoft we're talking about, it's going to be a long wait. Bing search is really not that bad though as I'm coming to find out. I've enjoyed Cortana a lot and use her as my Web search exclusively.   Also, no swipe forward/back like metro IE. Talk about had us spoiled and now metro IE doesn't even exist anymore."

The taskbar doesn't go away when im watching movie or playing Asphalt The clock on that corner consists of like eleven pixels and roughly two centimeters tall. Its tiny compared to the one in 8.1 The start menu needs major overhaul. At its current state, you have to hit the little hamburger in the corner to reach all apps (like Windows 8.0) instead of just swiping anywhere. Then you cant put large tiles next to each other, because each group can only have 6 horizontal columns to work with (large tile is 4x4, medium tile is 2x2, and small tile is 1x1). So at max you can only have a medium tile next to the large tile before moving to the next category. Oh, and removing the medium tile doesn't make the next category any closer either. Its simply horrible Im not allowed to see the files on my desktop in tablet mode.   Im not going to update to W10 anytime soon.

However, I can't believe it doesn't remember snap state, that is one of the first things I noticed. And, it would be nice to have a desktop ""tile"" that you could at least see and use the files on desktop in tablet mode. That said, switching over to desktop if you need to is easy.  I have no issues watching movies in full screen, but haven't tried Asphalt. And being able to run win32 programs in tablet mode and windowed ""universal"" apps in desktop mode is money. Those features and task view is enough for me to make the switch and not look back.  I will miss 8.1 though. Part of me thinks if they had just made a few more tweaks to 8.1 it would have been the ultimate OS, rather than the rest of the changes in the W10 user interface. RIP 8.1 but I gotta move on."
Surface,3d4ojz,pissantz34,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:38:08 2015 UTC,"Thing is, Im not sure if Win32 apps can be managed like tablet apps. First of all, theyre not designed with power consumption and Connected Standby in mind. Chrome, to name one, drains the battery in CS at its default setting. One other major issue is that Win32 apps cant be easily suspended to stop it from using the CPU like metro apps. Some programs (once again, Chrome is the most popular example) uses CPU cycles in the background, and consuming the battery life until you realize its too late. Since they cant be easily suspended, using desktop apps also requires you to manage the RAM consumption (especially on 2-4 GB RAM devices).  I personally think dividing the metro and desktop world in W8 makes a lot more sense, as you don't need to worry about metro apps (you don't even need to close them), but you do need to take care of desktop apps. Maybe its a whole different story on vocal enthusiasts with Core i7 and 16 GB RAM desktop PCs, my comment is simply about my experience with the Surface."

Surface,3d4ojz,pissantz34,4,Mon Jul 13 23:04:20 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you if ""8.1"" genuinely was available by switching to tablet mode, but it's really not. The only people who say that weren't using 8.1 to its full potential as a tablet OS. It was disappointing watching a so called expert review of the Windows 10 tablet experience, with a lot of upvotes on this subreddit trying to say it's a better tablet experience than 8.1, and he didn't even know about the app switcher panel. It's one of many users favorite features on 8.1.  u/ptrkhh hit on most of it. Tablet mode is basically a clunky and limited version of Metro (if you took out the desktop portion) with all ease of access panels removed, so everything, even app swapping, is tucked underneath an extra layer. Also, some legacy programs freak out if you launch them in tablet mode, so we'll be waiting on a fix for that. If they work, many look really dumb and tiny since they weren't meant to be forced full screen like that.   I feel like the lack of the swipe in panels is so detrimental to the experience that they'll be brought back as a toggle in some way. At least I hope so. I get the impression that the tablet side of things is largely unfinished. I can't imagine that they intended for everything to take us more steps to do. 8.1 introduced so many shortcuts and ease of access things, and Windows 10 has taken many away in favor of a more visual UI.   Honestly though, I'd have a ton less complaints if they just made the icons/hot spots for said icons scalable. I don't want to make my whole UI bigger, just the icons. They're so damn hard to press at the bottom with our type cover folded up (SP3). And I have tiny hands. I don't know how those big men manage to press the buttons."

In tablet mode, all apps (both 'metro' and traditional) are forced to be maximized. That's it. There is no touch-optimized UI like charms bar or swipe-and-swipe-and-swipe task switcher anymore.

Surface,3d65m2,xzhsh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:48:39 2015 UTC,"The main complaints about heating on the SP3 seem to be more about thermal throttling of the processor/gpu than from the tablet itself getting too hot to use. For painting on the go, you're not going to get much better--a Surface 3 (non-pro) would also be pretty good, though it would definitely be slower when working with large files and with some filters.  Most of what Photoshop does isn't actually all that processor/gpu intensive...it's only when you're actively manipulating a large image that it becomes a huge issue.  The SP3 may or may not be close to EOL--however, given the <1 year refresh on both the SP1 and SP2, it seems like a SP4 can't be that far out.  If it's not something you need for school starting in August or something of the sort, I'd at least wait a month or two to see if there's any announcement about the SP4 at/shortly after the Windows 10 launch. If there isn't, I'd consider purchasing a Surface 3 (non pro) and seeing how it fits your sketching needs for a few weeks. If it doesn't, return it and get a Surface Pro 3."

Photoshop is not to hard on the system. Current CC version is nice and has some tablet friendly options for the interface. The friction hinge on the surface pro 3 removes most of the heat issues on your lap if you put it in the lowest position. 6-7 hours is a good run time to expect for what you are looking to do.  There is no way to tell when this will switch. MS is doing  a big new Windows 10 devices thing soon though, and if they do not announce a new model there then I would say next spring when they normally announce the refresh. That would be more in sync with the release of the new Intel chips and the to market time they would need.    In the end I'd say go for it now. Waiting has almost always bitten me in the ass.

A real alternative is Groove music(currently Xbox music), it's quite nice with the new app on Windows 10. I'm halfway on switching to it from Google's music service. The app works when the sp3 sleeps and all that, pretty sure it's the only official player that has the capability at this time. You can store your personal music on OneDrive for cloud playback for free.   I say all this tentatively. The Windows 10 Groove music app is great looking--no ugly DPI issues like Spotify and iTunes, and it's a lot better to use than Xbox is (though both are inferior to Zune... Everything is!!). But right now there are no mobile apps for Groove. It will be coming to iOS, Android, and WP10 eventually. Keep an eye out cause I think it will be worth trying. Xbox music app on Android sucks currently IMO. Can't even seek in a song, but I'm still dealing with it because of the same issue you're having right now.   Until I switched, I was using the GMusic metro app with Google's service, and that works soooort of. It was so damn slow but I needed the music to continue to work while the screen was off. It wasn't working well enough to pay Google $10 a month for a service that only works in a browser (very poorly at that) if you aren't on your phone."

The video hardware/firmware in mobile devices are instead part of the CPU to save space, energy, and money; this arrangement is also far less powerful than video cards you'd find in desktops.

And the lack of dedicated VRAM in itself isn't going to hold you back as much as the weak-ass GPU. But that weak-ass GPU is still good enough to handle most popular PC games (any Blizzard game, LoL, Dota, etc,) if at low settings. Though for your particular example http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/life-is-strange/12460/?p=r specifically says ""not recommended for Intel HD graphics cards.""

As one person has mentioned as well is the screen is way too smooth to effectively write like a pencil and paper. My solution was to search amazon for a matte screen protector and put that on. Now when writing it feels more normal due to the extra friction; although I haven't written enough yet, but I'd imagine the pen tip will wear out fast. A quick call to Microsoft and they will send you some new pen nibs. Last thing to note is the matte screen will make the Surface screen look more dull in color and clarity."

As a bonus, I can also search the text and it'll do it's best to recognize my handwriting.  The note-taking experience with the Pen is a good enough reason to buy a Surface on its own.

I'll just quote chat support for you:   Ashley: We have 2 replacement options that you can take advantage.  Ashley: First, we have the Advanced Exchange.   Ashley: With Advanced Exchange, there is no initial charge (credit card hold only – hold for full retail value plus tax is not a charge). Charges apply if non-functioning items are not returned or warranty terms are not met. We will send you a replacement. Use the packing material from the replacement device to return your non-functioning item. If your non-functioning device is not returned to Microsoft within 15 days, you will be charged full retail value (plus tax) of a new device. This is faster as it will only take within 3-5 business days.  Ashley: The other one is the Standard Exchange.  Ashley: With Standard Exchange, we will ask you to return the faulty device first. Once that unit is received, it will be replaced with a similar device. This will take within 5-8 business days from the time our Warehouse receives the device.   I recently did a Standard exchange and it took a little over a week total.  Of course, if you have a Microsoft Store nearby, just take it in and get it done on the spot."

I'm only going into my second year, but everything I've heard indicates that you generally won't need a beefy computer on an everyday basis so a Surface is just fine. You have good note taking for more theoretical courses and it can easily handle IDEs etc for programming stuff. Tolerate the keyboard while you're at school, use your desktop keyboard at home."

I can't accept paying $1400-1500 for something that is a year old and that was the day 1 price. I'm looking at spending max $900 for a surface pro 3 i5 256gb mint condition. Is that good? I am concerned if there will be an announcement for the sp4 on July 29th but most of the rumors are claiming 2016. I've followed tech rumors since the original iPhone and they are usually correct on most of the reasonable things.   In the end, a fellow comp sci major and have a amd quad core, 8gb ram with video card desktop for intensive work. But, a surface pro for on the go and day to day. Do you think I should just go for the surface now? My concern is they will announce it and the price for the sp3 will drop. Other than that I am perfectly okay with the sp3."
Surface,3d3db8,Madhawk1995,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:00:01 2015 UTC,"Well, my course starts in September, so I still have a few weeks to wait for any announcement. I'd prefer to have something ready before the first day to get used to it a little bit. But I'd also prefer something with a larger screen screen size  - a bit closer to A4 - for reading journal articles. I know I will regret buying an SP3 if a 14"" SP4 appears.  With a used model you have no Complete cover, or at the least a reduced duration if the previous owner purchased it. I'm not normally one to go for extended guarantees, but the accidental cover for such an expensive device is appealing. I'm not a generally clumsy person but have in the past shattered an iPad screen and dropped my phone a couple of times."

I went with the SP3 because I realized I wasn't going to be OK paying full price for an incremental upgrade (when the SP3 is already a very powerful machine in a small, sleek package).   I got a mint condition refurb i5 8GB for $785 here on r/hardwareswap   Lightly used genuine power adapter on eBay:$20  New pen and keyboard (this was important to me, I did not want a second hand type cover or pen) $49 and $118 respectively on Amazon. I think you can get a better deal on the pen.   So for $972 I got everything in practically new condition, downside being i have no warranty. (I'm told I can get a replacement if needed for 250-300 if I destroy it somehow)  Compare this with the idea of getting a SP4 of similar specs when it comes out--$1300 tablet, $130 cover, tax, you're looking at a minimum of $1544 without MS Complete.

BTW, I was looking at a surface pro 3 i5 great condition 256gb with keyboard and ms complete care for $900. Should I take it? Or still wait for the announcement on July 29th that could possibly lower the sp3. Tbh, I doubt there will be any announcements because they would have had a sp4 by now with broadwell or an update. The sp4 is probably going to come with skylake next year and I want to study now. KhanAcademy on a surface is amazing. I can study from my bed rather than stuck at the desk. I love its flexibility."

The SP3's price may drop some but it's not going to immediately plummet into nothing. Besides, I really think the SP4 wouldn't even be worth upgrading to unless it's Skylake, and as you said, that's projected as a 2016 release."

Surface,3d3db8,xtapol,2,Mon Jul 13 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not in school any more, but am a web developer that used the SP3 for a time. The tablet mode + pen is probably the computer's biggest selling point. If you plan on using it to take notes, you will probably love it. I used it to sketch out ideas for UI design, and having a digital drawing surface is so convenient compared to using paper or a whiteboard.  The performance is ok, it's an ultra low voltage CPU but it's still an i5. I could run a text editor + IDE with a JVM app running and it didn't slow down too much.  The biggest disadvantage, imo is the keyboard. The key action is adequate but the layout leaves a bit to be desired (Home/End key placement is bad, and no Fn key on the left side to use it + arrow keys). Having to use the F-keys a lot in IDEs made it kind of clunky, I definitely had to use a full size keyboard.  Overall I would say to get it if you plan on using it to draw on/take hand-written notes, otherwise I would just get a regular laptop. You can get something for the same price or less that is much more powerful and will be less cramped when doing actual work."

If you're the type that wants to do handwritten notes on OneNote, then the Surface Pro 3 or Surface 3 will be a solid choice. However, if you don't, I'd urge you towards a MacBook Air or Pro. A good amount of people prefer OSX/*nix then Windows for ""coding"". Not to mention, the battery life on the OSX laptops will probably blow away the Surface series.

If you're waffling between the Surface Pro and some other Lenovo or Dell device, don't worry about it, the Surface is the right choice.  If you're waffling between a Surface Pro and a Macbook Pro… that's a bit of a different discussion. It's probably an unpopular opinion in this subreddit, but a lot of developers like using OS X. The OS has strong Unix underpinnings, so working with open source projects is a breeze. If you ever need Windows and Virtual Studio, it's just a VM or a reboot away. MacBooks are versatile little machines. At the end of the day it all comes down to preference though, so if you're attached to Windows, stick with it and get the Surface."
Surface,3d3db8,KazakiLion,2,Mon Jul 13 15:47:08 2015 UTC,"I know this is going to be an unpopular post in this subreddit, but I think it's good that OP reads it.   My experiences with Windows vs. OS X vs. Linux in college:  All of my computer science professors and TAs had MacBooks, and their notes, lectures, and sample code were written in OS X. If they ran a piece of code you submitted, it was in an OS X environment. They all stated in their first lecture, first lab, or syllabus that they highly recommend using OS X for compatibility.   I've spent countless hours rewriting code to make it compile in Windows, tracking down Windows-compatible libraries/packages when the ones used in class wouldn't work in Windows, writing code in Windows only to realize it doesn't work in OS X and then rewriting it on a school computer so I can submit it, etc. In the end I installed Linux on my machine and these issues went away.  That said, Linux on the Surface Pro is well documented, there are terminal emulators for Windows, and VMs should work well enough for most classwork. From my experience, anything written in OS X should work in Linux as well, at least within the scope of undergrad coursework, so there's no need to buy a MacBook.   Also, these are my experiences (although it spans two universities--the one I went to and another from which I followed a bunch of online lectures). Many schools are heavily invested in Windows, so maybe you won't run into these issues.  tl;dr: Be prepared to install Linux on your Surface Pro."

It took me forever to get Linux running well on my Lenovo tablet in school.  My school was at least nice enough to provide a Unix server we could SSH into in order to test our code. Reaching out to your CS department and seeing if they have an official/unofficial recommendation probably wouldn't be that bad an idea. I can't imagine making it through a CS program without being exposed to some level of *nix these days, so it seems like OS X is the way to go if you don't have any particular allegiance to Windows."

My school was at least nice enough to provide a Unix server we could SSH into in order to test our code.    Ah, yes, I forgot about this one. It's pretty easy to SSH to a server and do your assignments that way (and it means you can get away with a cheaper, less powerful machine).   it seems like OS X is the way to go if you don't have any particular allegiance to Windows   That's probably easier, but it's not necessary--Linux will work fine, assuming that it's compatible with your machine (as you mentioned, it can be a headache to get up and running on certain laptops)."

You might not have any issues, but I've run into Python modules that don't work in Windows, spent hours rewriting code to make it compatible with Windows because I typed it up during a lecture while following along with the professor and he was on a Mac, etc. Fortunately, if this becomes an issue, Linux on the Surface is well documented at this point."

Surface,3d4mj1,Silversee,0,Mon Jul 13 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Windows RT is just Windows 8.1 recompiled for ARM (minus a few x86 and PC-AT hardware-specific subsystems that make no sense on non-Intel SOCs).    While existing x86 binary software cannot work, it would have been rather straightforward for developers to recompile Win32 and .NET applications to run on Windows RT, just as Microsoft did with Office 2013 (and the OS itself), had Microsoft provided the tools and permission to do so. Instead, in its quest to turn Windows into an iOS competitor, Microsoft chose explicitly to prevent desktop software from running Windows RT.  Windows RT was only borked because Microsoft made it so.  On purpose.  I find it sadly ironic when I hear virtually everyone dis Windows RT as some kind of lame OS, when it literally is ""just Windows"".  And because it is just Windows, there is no technical reason that an RT version of Windows 10 could not be released following the same development practices as for Windows 8.1. They're building Windows 10 Mobile for ARM anyway, so it's not like they don't have the infrastructure and processes in place to do this.  It's just a cold hearted business decision.  So while I will still be a Microsoft fan, every once in a while I'm going take my Surface 2, my copy of Windows Media Center, my Windows Phone 7 smartphone, and my Zune HD and go pout in a corner. :-)"

Surface,3d3cle,vohk,2,Mon Jul 13 13:46:22 2015 UTC,"The one short coming of our 2011 MBPs that I find that pops up and may still lead you to buy something new is it does not have USB 3.  Thunderbolt devices are not as available and are more expensive.  USB 3 is more user friendly (can attach anything, including monitors) and is cheap and available.  Good luck with whichever path you choose."
Surface,3d3cle,Nausky,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:08:42 2015 UTC,"1) I would probably agree, although it might be worthwhile to pay attention to your RAM usage on your Macbook while you're working. I'm not all that familiar with memory management in OS X but generally speaking there isn't much point jumping to 8GB if you're well short of using 4. Pay attention to hangs and slowdowns as well. The main advantage of more RAM is less swapping of data from the much slower HDD. How large are the project files you're working on at a given time?  I would not recommend the Surface 3 or the i3 SP3 in your case. Both are perfectly good systems but the Surface 3 lacks an SSD (uses slower eMMC) and both are underpowered for heavier applications, at least for my taste. I can't speak to how pleasant the i5 is for CAD work and such but my i5/256GB/8GB has yet to let me down.  2) Can't help you there.  3) Windows 10 should be pretty much a straight, albeit minor upgrade. Judging by early reviews and reports from people already running the preview on their SP3, it doesn't seem like there will be much reason to avoid it. A good example is it lets you choose between tablet/touch and desktop behaviour.  From what I've been seeing, I wouldn't expect to hear much new information in the near future. Nobody knows anything about the SP4 (not even any credible leaks), which suggests it's at least a few months out. That they released a new SP3 model in the last few weeks and that there doesn't seem to be a major Intel platform upgrade coming around till next year means it probably won't be releasing anytime soon.  The usual rules apply: there will always been something new and shiny coming, so either you need a new system now or you don't. If you don't, wait a few weeks, for new info or a sale. If you do, it's a nice system."
Surface,3d3cle,HeartlessHowl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:44:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply.  My mac can't handle much, it only has 4GB of RAM. So I will definitely need to upgrade to 8GB. Couldn't tell you the size of my average of the files, I can run photoshop and InDesign at once, but having my browser open on top of that slows me down a lot."
Surface,3d3cle,HeartlessHowl,2,Mon Jul 13 12:28:26 2015 UTC,"Yes 8gb is your bare minimum IMO. The one user who said he wouldn't want to work from his surface is being bogged down by the 4gb ram. 4gb is just not enough for anything really. I'm running the tech preview of 10 (which has all sorts of monitoring services running in the background for troubleshooting purposes) and just having my browser open and groove music has 4GB of ram utilized... I would hate this thing right now if I had the 4gb model.   Since you realize you'd need the 8GB model, you'll notice very little difference in performance between the computers you're considering. We have a 2014 MacBook Pro, an i5 8GB SP3, and two top of the line gaming desktops at the house. For all non-gaming tasks, all of our computers perform at the same level. The SP3's i5 is a good CPU and MS has very high quality storage installed. The question really is ""is 8GB enough?"" I believe it is, I've never had a genuine use for more than 8GB unless trying to run virtual machines. But your use case may vary. If you do need more than 8 consistently, then the surface line unfortunately isn't for you.   There is also a considerable learning curve accompanied with learning to write on a glass screen. It'll feel weird and it might even feel disappointing when you go to draw in photoshop for the first time, since there's no traction. But you will get used to it! The SP3 is an amazing productivity tool that has top of the line specs. I'd personally never go back to a traditional laptop."

Surface,3d1csv,hippopotamusflavour,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:49:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a professional 3D artist. I don't paint professionally but I sketch a lot. It feels great. The pen does jitter at slow speeds and I don't like the way the side buttons feel. I glued some bumps on the button to make them easier to press. That makes it feel more tactile and easier to keep the button held down.   When I installed Wacom drivers so I could also use my tablet, the NTrig drivers went crazy. Touch and pen would not be distinguished in painting programs, pressure sensitivity stopped working and the jitteriness got worse. Uninstalling fixed the problem.   I installed RadialMenu which lets you map both buttons for MMB and RMB which is useful for 3D programs. But it also lets you click while hovering. I prefer this.   Speaking of 3D, many 3D apps have issues. Older versions of Maya have a tiny UI, 3D-Coat immediately goes into super-heat mode and the fans go crazy. It made it unusable as far as I was concerned. It got so hot I was worried.  My favorite painting apps are Mischief for the feeling of painting freely without worrying about resolution, Sketchable for being able to quickly open a book and sketch without worrying about saving, and Manga Studio for amazing painterly brushes.  I would sketch in the first two and finish stuff in Manga Studio. Sketchbook Pro is also cool and the latest version has simple animation tools, but I rarely used it because the brushes are harder to customize."

So yeah, I recommend the surface 3 wholeheartedly. (Surface pro 3 starts from 800$ and it sounds like you don't need the extra fire power, if you do, than obviously go for the SP3 without question!) edit:And I forgot to mention that the Surface 3 has a USB port, the iPad doesn't. so that's another thing to consider."

You do not need to and cannot maintain LiPo batteries useing most of those methods, it just doesn't matter nearly as much with LiPo.

Also, that's not a great statement to make. MS stated that for daily use (5 days a week), full discharge-recharge cycles should only cause a 20% drain on overall battery capacity over 4 years on the SP3 battery.  Those ""don't go under 40%!!!"" claims - it doesn't kill your battery. If you always do full cycles, it will wear faster, but not ridiculously.

All indications so far it should be good.  As far as if it's worth the price... That's debatable.  I feel MS should have sold both models with 4gb RAM.

Surface,3d2mu9,cmplieger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"I hope so. I'm just mad because Microsoft treats surface differently from the other pc's. For example, they won't let surfaces have the Intel driver with Intel graphics control panel, which is important for gaming and other things. You can still get it with a hacky way, but the point is you can't trust them to not be annoying like that.  Also, I don't see why I can't just manually download the driver. It's so simple. Why put in so many roadblocks? They seem to only exist to piss off users."
Surface,3d2mu9,cmplieger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:18:12 2015 UTC,"The other intel drivers, including for the surface pro 3 ask came out together because they're all core processors. Intel develops the Atom x7 graphics independently for now which is why the surface 3 win 10 intel drivers came out late,and are still underdeveloped. It's on Intern, not Microsoft.  As for the control panel, I guess I agree that it should be accessible, but there really isn't anything in there that you can't configure in game."

But that keyboard is probably going to stay and be an eternal deal-breaker for me.  The Surface keyboard might be an acquired taste, but it still somehow manages to have more key travel then the new Macbook.

Battery life isn't as good, but it doesn't really matter because the MacBook battery life is no better than any other Apple laptop - it isn't any standout, and anyone who was considering a SP3 before wouldn't be drawn away by the MacBook because of that.

Surface,3czw88,arc111111,-29,Sun Jul 12 13:57:55 2015 UTC,"Lol what a fail once again. Glass is an insulator. The tablet never reaches 40 degrees Celsius let alone alone 91 farenheit. Once again, did you even elementary school science bro? This is a non issue. Do you even own a surface pro 3?  Edit: Just incase you didn't notice I was also playing Cs:go which can and has made it go to 90 degrees Celsius and averaging around 60-70ish normally."

Surface,3czw88,C1t1zen_Erased,4,Sun Jul 12 11:46:03 2015 UTC,So your trying to say it doesn't cool the tablet?
Surface,3czw88,K3VINbo,3,Sun Jul 12 12:48:37 2015 UTC,What settings/framerates do you have in csgo?
Surface,3czw88,K3VINbo,4,Sun Jul 12 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"You should have it in a closed metal box.  Why closed?   To not damage your SP  Why Metal?  To easily make the temperature from the SP try to escape towards the cold point (Coldness is not a energy, but warmth is. Therefor it is the warmth that goes towards the coldness and not the opposite)  If you're really into doing it perfectly, you should make it attached to the warmest place on the SP and use some cream that works like a thermal paste to make the warmth transfer easier from the Surface's Surface to the ""cooling box"" or radiator. Like this you will have the warmth escape quickly through the SP without going through much of the SP."
Surface,3czw88,Iakchos,-2,Sun Jul 12 11:02:31 2015 UTC,This is really interesting. I might actually try this with some sorta smooth metal as to not scratch the surface. Do you know if thermal paste will damage the finish of the tablet itself?
Surface,3czw88,porkyfly,3,Sun Jul 12 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"I just did some research into this. The thermal paste will get stuck through long time as it dries. There is a liquid to remove the thermal paste, but it could remove some colour of the SP so I guess it isn't optional.  Also since the ice has to be a lower degree than 0 degrees Celsius to remain ice. It isn't a very long lasting cooler for the high temperatures of a SP3.  If you're into the more advanced and probably more expensive ways to cool it or even have some leftover PC parts. You can use something like a CPU fan cooler like this. The grids will seperate the temperature from the SP all over it, making it easier to cool all of it. What's important here, is to still have the cooling element or a grid in this scenario tightly attached to the SP, which is still a reason why we need a material to work like thermal paste.   The material for a thermal paste would be preferred if it could easily get washed of and not dry so bad it gets totally stuck on the SP3. One can test toothpaste, if it starts smelling you could just wash it off, if not it's good. Try to find a really neutral and ""dense"" toothpaste. I will try to thing of alternatives, but I'm out of ideas.  Also you could use liquid cooling solutions, which could be more efficient.  If you're the god of cash or something, try using a mini heat pump to cool your SP. This is probably very OP but unnecessary unless you're truly desperate   I've been going back to thinking of the ways you could do this with the thing you might have at home instead of all this bullshit. You could use an ordinary fan to cool and find something that could look like what's on these pictures to ""seperate the heat a little bit"". Be creative and if you have multiple things to make the ""grid"" larger, that's only better. But never, ever, ever, use steelwool, that shit takes fire easily in conditions like these, both during the construction of a cooling system and if it receives great temperatures from the SP. Also, if you get pieces of steelwool inside your SP. You ARE fucked.  IDK why I've spent 40 minutes writing this comment late at the evening, I guess I'm just really engaged in this topic. I tried to give most of my knowledge about this, so you don't have to limit yourself to my suggestions. Also if you need answers on some of mine or maybe questions like optimal materials or something, maybe someone else or someone you know have some great ideas, or maybe even you see something sitting right next to you that could be fine to use.  If you think I can answer to something anyways, reply to this comment or my latest in this thread or PM me. Also I'd love to see what you could create if you do. Hopefully the creation will be much simpler an less complex than my entire comment."

Also, condensation happens because of cool air flowing through hot parts, correct? This means anything which cools the air (conducts heat from the hot air) begond a certain temp inside the surface is dangerous."

Surface,3czw88,porkyfly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:07:56 2015 UTC,But would it be bad because of condensation?
Surface,3czw88,jbiserkov,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't so much while your device is running hot, but what happens when your device returns to normal temperatures.   The CPU has a great heatsink which means the temperature of the heatsink will drop very quickly when the CPU is no longer pumping out heat. Hot air has a higher capacity for humidity than cool air and when the air cools quickly, the water in the air condenses (think fog). So when you are using ice water or cold water bottle as a 'source for cool', you are essentially introducing a high humidity cold air into the device.   If the air in the device does not draw in dryer air prior to cooling below the dew point of the air, or the humid air is trapped in the device, the water will start to condense on anything cooler than the dew point.  To put this succinctly, having a glass of ice or cool water bottle is a bad idea because you have a possibility of ruining your device through water damage with little to no benefit. You're better off using an external desk fan which can provide greater air flow. Even simple USB fans have been shown to stop throttling and will not damage your device."

Theoretically i'm thinking the heatsink should work but not as well as with thermal paste but unless we can think of a non damaging alternative I guess it's just gonna be bare contact.

Surface,3d1nak,mvs5191,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:06:56 2015 UTC,"Resolution: As long as they're all 1080p or under, neither device has an edge in terms of resolution.  If you want to play something back at 1440p or 4k, the SP3 is going to have that edge.  Screen size: The SP3 is a little bigger, so it's up to you whether that's a pro or a con.  You might enjoy the bigger screen, or you might find the bigger device more cumbersome.  Kickstand: The SP3 has a variable kickstand, whereas the S3 has a 3-position kickstand. The variable kickstand will obviously work better in more situations, though it's up to you do decide whether that's worth the extra cost.  Performance: I don't know how how the S3 fares in terms of video decoding performance, so I will defer to someone else on that.  Storage: Both have expandable storage, so I would suggest you get a smaller-capacity device and augment it with an SD card if you need to.  Other uses: You may find that you like your Surface so much that you want to do more with it.  If you hope to use demanding applications like PhotoShop, Visual Studio, or Chrome CAD, you need an SP3.

The best bit is that the handwriting experience is pretty close to actually writing on paper. There's less friction, but other than that its pretty close. To the point that the surface has supplanted notebooks for me.  From what you've said, I'd say the Surface is a good option.

Surface,3czy7j,kojin,4,Sun Jul 12 09:31:12 2015 UTC,"I also switched from an iPad with GoodNotes primarily to a surface pro 3 (drawboard and OneNote).    It really is so much better than the iPad.  Another huge benefit is split screen (you can actually have up to three windows open at once).    Often I'll have OneNote running on the right side, and a PDF or video playing on the left side.  Then if I want to check email quickly, I can open it in the middle of the screen and keep the flow going.    I also have OneNote on my iPhone, and get all my notes synced.    I used the iPad for years, and the surface pro 3 is a much better device for students, and has me doing much more than I was able to, with the iPad."

Surface,3cxuv8,skralogy,4,Sat Jul 11 20:19:26 2015 UTC,Your case is ideal for purchasing the sp3. I however am in an entirely different boat then most users. I have been planning on installing a surface tablet into my truck and use it for a in car infotainment center and be able to take it out and use it as a work productivity device. Because of the fabrication needed i would rather wait to see the specs and dimensions of the sp4. I also have a strong feeling some very powerful periperals relating to 3d/ hololens may be in the works like a kinect/ dual camera mapping system. If im right (which like most rumors or guesses probably not) then the sp4 could be the perfect device for  car installs and work.
Surface,3cxuv8,ratshack,2,Sat Jul 11 21:30:43 2015 UTC,SP4 would have the same form and be compatible with SP3 accessories like the dock.   That is one of the only things that MS has said about anything concerning future SP's.

If used it for a few projects I worked on.

The BIG exception is if you're using YouTube with Firefox because when using Firefox, YouTube sends WebM video by default, and since the Surface Pro doesn't have hardware decoding for WebM it gets the CPU going mad crazy. If you use Firefox, get the extension h264ify, which forces Youtube to send mp4 video, which works perfectly. Or just use IE.  tl;dr don't use Chrome, if you use Firefox get h264ify."

Surface,3cwajp,thatoneguy180,16,Sat Jul 11 08:50:43 2015 UTC,"Heres just one little summary i made of a course I took last semester (developmental biology): http://1drv.ms/1CvdoCS  Excuse my partly sloppy german handwriting and onenote online for messing up the layout. I always write on grid lines (mostly zoomed in to 200%) and advise to customize the quick access toolbar. Observe which tools you use most often and put them there.   What can be really nice is the ""record audio"" feature as it highlights what you wrote while its being replayed. I use it in lectures that I know will be important or particularily difficult (Remember to ask the lecturer if he/she is ok with you recording!).  As it can never be overstated: handwritten text as well as text in inserted images is searchable! Press ctrl+E. No need to convert anything.   As far as the standard cloud-storage goes - I'm not much of a fan. I store my uni notebooks locally, because I work here and there and I always want to have everything with me (and i ALWAYS have my surface with me) and as I never use any other PC to access my notes anyway. I wrote a little robocopy script though, that backups everything to the cloud if my surface should fail me. I have a cloud-notebook for everything that I want synched in between devices too.   My last (and maybe most important) advice would be: be a little patient with the transition. I have been a pen and paper guy (always in search of the perfect pen), so it took me a while to adopt. Your notes get neater, more organized (my example up on top maybe isn't perfect, but you have more possibilities arranging things on the endless digital paper than you have on a fixed size piece of paper). In the beginning I wished I could back up to paper, but I forced myself to stick with it and adopt. And now I dont want to go back.   I had to do a microscopy drawing class thing this semester and I had been drawing with good ol' pencil on good ol' paper. I found myself constantly thinking ""ok, lets undo that line"", wanting to select and move around text blocks or swearing because the eraser wasn't precise enough and erased more than i wanted and i couldnt undo erasing perfectly fine parts.. oh well. :)"

Course ppt: import to onenote in separate pages, take notes on the slide and around it if needed Lab ppt: don't have to take that many notes, so I annotate them in Powerpoint when needed PDFs: depends on how many notes I need, either print them into OneNote or annotate in drawboard    My OneNote is organized like this:   Notebook: semester Section: class/lab Main pages: each ppt subpages: the slides   I have them stored on the cloud since I have internet access anywhere, the only time I didn't have internet I just tethered from my phone without problem."
Surface,3cwajp,svieriObraza,3,Sat Jul 11 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"These are my physical chemistry notes I took last semester https://onedrive.live.com/redir?page=view&resid=B92D46C09D58DFEE!2327&authkey=!APEo61hGXDeuJAE  I found having graph paper grids on and zooming in around 200-300% were best for neatest handwriting and still gave decent handwriting speed.  Some of the things I've found useful on here that you can't do (or do as easily) with pen and paper are:  Shapes tool:  Drawing perfect graphs, shapes for diagrams, or boxes for important equations just makes everything look better.  Add/remove space:  This was great if a professor jumped around and changed parts of the notes from before.  I could easily just add or remove the extra space needed.  Copy and paste:  If there's a proof where a small term in a lengthy equation gets changed, being able to copy and paste saves time.  Switching pen colors easily: Makes having diagrams/figures with multiple data sets much easier to read.  I didn't use it a ton, but when I did it was nice.  Infinite page space: Nice to never run out of space, just keep swiping down.  Like others have said, there is a bit of transition to switching from pen an paper, but I can't see myself going back to pen and paper for taking notes"
Surface,3cyo5k,Krnxrat,3,Sat Jul 11 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any anti-theft built into Surface. The best you can probably do is at least report the theft to the police, and maybe check out some local pawn shops to see if anyone tried to sell it there. Since you still have the box, you should be able to find the serial number on the barcode label."
Surface,3cyo5k,zidane2k1,3,Sun Jul 12 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"When my S3 was stolen, I contacted the MS Surface support folks, and they took down my info and gave me a phone number to their legal side that I was to give to the police (so they could coordinate on tracking the device via IP and serial number...however that works). I filed a report with the local police via their online form and included the number there. Of course, depending on how big your city is, odds are the cops will never get around to looking into your report until much much later. Better assume it's gone for good and go on with your life with a new one."

Surface,3cyl4h,iEzhik,3,Sun Jul 12 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"By any chance do you know of any alternatives please? What I want is a small light portable Windows PC (tablet hybrid is a plus) which has goodish specs and can be used for light gaming. So far I've found the Surface Pro to be the best choice. Anything else I've seen had inferior performance, build, portability etc."
Surface,3cyl4h,_monad,5,Sun Jul 12 03:06:57 2015 UTC,"Ultra portable laptops and hybrids are not meant for gaming, it stresses the cooling solution greatly as these machines don't have the thermal dissipation capability necessary to sustain gaming at acceptable temperatures. They're meant as productivity devices, to take notes, browse the web, write documents, watch videos. If you want to game, get yourself a desktop, even if it's just a desktop with an i3 with a 270x, it will outclass 99% of laptops out there."
Surface,3cyl4h,Hot_Teenage_Grills,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:15:45 2015 UTC,"I just bought a Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga S1 from the Lenovo Outlet (scratch and dent/refurbished products), and I'm loving it. It has roughly the same specs as the mid-high spec Pro 2s. Intel i5 4200U (dual core, hyperthreaded) which means Intel 4400 integrated graphics, 8 gigs of ram, and a 128GB SSD that I upgrade to a 500GB Samsung 850 EVO that I got for $160 on Amazon. The laptop itself cost $535 shipped, and got here in about 3 days. It's the hybrid style that flips all the way backward on itself into tablet mode. It's also a ThinkPad, and after 2 weeks of use I can attest to the commonly acknowledged idea that ThinkPad build quality is a cut above the rest. I'm absolutely loving it.  As for gaming, I've been playing a lot of Civ 5, which is handles very well. I also played some Dirt 3 on it which, surprisingly, it managed with a lower resolution and some modified settings. I was able to get about 40fps though without downscaling too much. FIFA 15 ran a bit too slow for my tastes at high resolution (got around 20 fps at 1080p low settings), but at lower resolution it ran fine.  Also worth noting that the keyboard and touchpad are top of the line. The keyboard is the best I've ever used on a small factor laptop and the touchpad is the best I've ever used ever. I don't know if you're going to be using this for much productivity stuff as well, but there it is.  And to the gent who said they're ""not meant for gaming"", that's a load of BS. They have limitations in terms of what they can run smoothly, but there's no problem with device stress. Every Intel mobile processor since the first gen of i3/i5/i7 has had temperature management built in such that they'll throttle if necessary. You're not going to damage anything. (Worth noting that this ThinkPad Yoga actually has fans, so there is active cooling, which helps a ton). I have a gaming desktop and a gaming laptop, and I still find gaming in a super-portable form factor to be a great joy. Just don't let those suggestions discourage you. Understand the limitations of a device and then enjoy it to the max!"
Surface,3cyl4h,Rashkh,3,Sat Jul 18 18:51:19 2015 UTC,"When the SP3 first came out it had throttling issues and the 'high performance"" power option wasn't available. I believe that the throttling issues have since been sorted out but am unaware as to whether or not the performance power option has been enabled.  If you can, consider waiting for the SP4 and see how it performs. If it's a superior machine for your needs then you buy it. If you find that the SP3 or SP2 are better options for your use case then the release of a newer model will drop the prices of the older ones."
Surface,3cyl4h,PhillyITguy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:56:58 2015 UTC,"The throttling is due to having 1 fan to cool it off instead of 2. That is not something you can ""sort out""/"
Surface,3cyl4h,DominusVenturae,2,Sun Jul 12 00:06:01 2015 UTC,Also it's thinner. I don't play games on my sp3 but recently installed civ v to see how it goes 8 months later. It ran good but on low settings and it got too hot to play because using touch to drag units burns flesh.
Surface,3cyl4h,jhoff80,2,Sun Jul 12 00:22:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, I find the SP2 to be better than the SP3 in nearly all ways (okay, mostly the smaller dimensions)... but performance isn't going to be THAT much different.  Yeah, the Pro 2 is cooled a little better and throttles less, but you're not going to be doing heavy gaming on it.  I've played some Civ 5 on it, but that's not a great experience because of how hot it gets and how quickly the battery dies."
Surface,3cyl4h,angrygr8,2,Sun Jul 12 01:35:42 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you my experience.   Yes, the SP2 can play games better than the SP3. I'm talking about the i5 versions in both cases. Simply put, I'm able to play WoW on 1080p on SP2 on a external monitor without any kind of sacrifice. Now, on the SP3 I have to cap the framerate to 30fps, lower the resolution to 1400x900 and it still heats up more than the SP2. It's dissapointing because the SP3 is so much nicer in every other department. Form factor is a huge plus. I myself have decided to give up the SP2 just because I like the look and feel of the SP3 better, but in regards to gaming, it doesn't even come close, sadly.  I must say the comments against gaming on a portable are quite annoying. There are some of us out there who don't necessarily need a high end desktop to play. For me the HD 4400 proved sufficient and the iris 5100 on the macbook pro proved ideal."

Surface,3cyl4h,holycrapisingopera,2,Sun Jul 12 00:18:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going to strongly disagree here, there's plenty of reason to want a Surface and also use it for gaming.  I'm tired of writing paragraphs trying to defend people like myself, so I'll keep it simple. PC gaming, many times, is more about functionality than performance. Having an x86 SoC opens up so many more gaming doors than a Android/iOS tablet, but you still need a good amount of power. Bay Trail won't cut it, a Surface Pro will.  You can run Minecraft, many strategy games, 4X games (X3: Terran Conflict is so crazy deep of a game, and runs fantastically on a Surface Pro), almost any indie game, on a Surface. When you're in between school and home, it's awesome to pull out your ""tablet"" and do some gaming. It's lighter than almost any equivalent Ultrabook with more power than megaportables like the MacBook.  That's it. It's really good for us, so don't bug us about it."

The only CPU it does better for processing power is the i3 variant.   http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp[]=816&cmp[]=2054  Maybe you're thinking of the SP2 vs SP3?

If you have money to burn of course try an S3 out."
Surface,3cydwc,ratshack,2,Sat Jul 11 22:39:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured I didn't need too much computing power but if the screen is that much better I may spring for it.

But of course in the end that might be better than another Microsoft charger debacle. The SP1 charger is the worst.  I'd be wary about the speed too, it's not exactly the computing power (though that's about half the power of the SP1) that you'd probably notice as much as the super slow drive in it.  It's much more like if you were running all your programs off of the SD card in the SP1."

You will hate working with your external HDD for doing batch edits and loads of layers. My recommendation, get a external hard drive case, and a SSD. You will get speed, and won't have to worry about drop risks. Now if a SSD fucks up, you are fucked. Those don't have a many recovery options like HDD's do. But SSD failure is less likely than damage from falling off a desk or you rushing to put away your stuff to get somewhere else and corrupting files on a HDD. To get capacities that you will want, it will be pricey. But SSD prices are still following Moore's law so 50% less expensive per gigabyte in 2 years compared to this year.

SSD's are not susceptible to drop damage like HDD's are. I don't mean to insult your intelligence if you know this already, but I'll give a brief analogy. A HDD is like a record player. The disk spins, the head of the needle finds where the information is, computer reads from it. How a HDD differs though is if the needle touches the disk, it is called a head crash. No bueno for data. A lot of times the information can be recovered, but it's hard to say at what frequency and difficulty. A SSD on the otherhand, is basically magic on a stick. Energy passes through, information comes back. Conceptually tricky shit to explain.

I don't use blender but I'll assume there's some form of rendering at some point so I'll have to toss out that an i3 model will give you really really really crummy time the bigger the file/more detailed it gets. Your i5 4 GB will probably slog forth but an i5 8 GB will be more than fine."

Blender can get more complicated really fast due to the way you build geometry but I would imagine if you turn down the detail settings it will run ok. Rendering will take forever. I'm on an i5 8Gb model.   How hard it is will depend on you. Using a mouse and keyboard is going to be easiest I would imagine. Also the screen is a little small to work on detailed stuff.

Surface,3czoon,Montanx,8,Sun Jul 12 06:16:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a perspective from an economics point of view: The demand for the accessory is elastic - basically not everyone needs it, contrary to your belief.  Therefore, the $130 added cost applies only to consumers that need it and are willing to pay.   Effectively, those that don't need it don't get it. It satisfies them at a reduce price point.  Those that need enough it are more than happy to pay. It satisfies them them but at a higher price point.   If you are whining and complaining, then you are probably the marginal consumer; your need for the accessory is somewhere in the middle leading to higher price sensitivity. Therefore you feel the need to whine and fuss about the price.   So you see this is an efficient system when viewed in totality.   We should be thanking Microsoft for not shoving the keyboard down everyone's throat.   Hope that helped."

Surface,3czoon,Iakchos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"Microsoft had a choice of:   Sell the cover separately for $130 Sell the Surface with the cover and increase the price by $130   If even one person decides not to get the cover, then choice one is the correct choice. I can guarantee you that if the SP4 is only available bundled with the cover, everyone, and I do mean everyone, will complain about it. They'll either want to use their existing SP3 cover, not want the Microsoft cover, or will be unable to get the color combo they want.  Regarding whether or not they are worth it, that really depends on your specific use case. If you don't plan on taking advantage of the digitizer then I believe they aren't worth it. If you want/need the digitizer, they're probably the best laptop you can get in regards to price/performance."
Surface,3czoon,Rashkh,0,Sun Jul 12 06:51:40 2015 UTC,"No they didn't. The keyboard does not cost $130 to make. They could have included it with the $600 surface and not lost much, if anything. The keyboard is only $130 because there's nothing else out there."

I'm saying that, regardless of how it's packaged, you'll still be paying $130 for it precisely because there's nothing else out there. Microsoft had the choice of packaging it with the Surface or selling it separately. Selling it separately is in the best interest of the consumer since at least some people will not want to buy it for whatever reason."
Surface,3czoon,Rashkh,0,Sun Jul 12 10:03:13 2015 UTC,"If it was sold WITH the Surface, then it would be a different story and would likely not be worth $130, as there would be no separate pricing for the keyboard, assuming they didn't release other colors separately, and even then it would be different."
Surface,3czoon,TheAdobeEmpire,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:47:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, it costs more just because it's a product on it's own and taxes have to be payed for it, if it was included the cost of the tablet wouldn't increase too much."

They're barely trained as it is and are just regular biased consumers wearing colored shirts. Commission or not, people will try to rub off their biases on unsuspecting customers."
Surface,3cva9z,Domino584,2,Sat Jul 11 02:24:15 2015 UTC,Same with most tech repair shops.  The vast majority of folks don't have a single clue on what they're talking about.
Surface,3cva9z,Neosword3000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:50:20 2015 UTC,"Well, most reviews do the same thing. I'd measure their opinions a little bit higher than Amazon.com reviews, because they have more experience with working with multiple devices all the time, and thus usually have a better understand of what's out there. Obviously, my first stop would be major online reviews and then work down from there.  Everyone has their biases. Do keep in mind that some people choose some of those jobs because they are actually passionate about the tech, and thus can be quite knowledgeable. You never know who you're going to find in there. Though, I agree that in terms of technical opinion, I'd usually take it with a grain of salt. I'd still argue that it's a good resource to use though. If you're the type that spends hours reading amazon reviews once he's exhausted the major tech sites, you might as well jump into the store, play with it yourself, and see what they think."
Surface,3cva9z,minipolliwog,2,Sat Jul 11 15:47:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, the biggest reason why tech reviews these days annoy me, between subjective biases and bad testing (""we used Chrome and the Surface sucked in these tests!"").   I have no doubt there are good floor employees out there who actually care about how a tech will work with someone's use case (assuming customer even knows what that is), but I gave up pretty early after poor luck. For example, I remember going to a Best Buy and playing with a Surface 2 and an employee kept trying to show me laptops and iPads. Like I gave a crap.  That said, I'm not a typical retail customer either, I guess, so I can sympathize with trying to sell to tech-phobic people all day. I think when talking to the salespeople, it's best never to (1) go in blind or (2) expect a lot of help if you already know what you're doing.   Now, someone below from retail explained some reasoning behind trying to upsell, in terms of return rates, but I don't see that as a purely benevolent behavior. A salesperson who manages to upsell will always get good marks from their own company; that's why salespeople exist, to pad the bottom line. Rare are the service people who genuinely try to save their customers money for a product/service they may not need.   Considering the description that OP posted as to what that particular employee said, he was not acting for the benefit of the customer in terms of avoiding a return: There was no discussion of a use case, unless OP left that out. And said employee clearly had never actually tried to use the thing for anything, and I don't trust such people at all (on the other hand, if I wanted a Lumia and an employee pulled out his Lumia, I'm all ears). He was merely spouting assumptions based on, most likely, outdated information about outdated hardware. 2GB is fine for a lot of people; the CPU isn't horribly slow. There are plenty of threads and comments in this subreddit about utility. And even an SP3 would run into the same initial issues for completely tech-illiterate people, like battery life in the first week or so while it's trying to update everything.  Any salesperson who doesn't understand use case in discussion really isn't worth my time."
Surface,3cva9z,Neosword3000,3,Sat Jul 11 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"(Edit: Whoa, huge wall of text. I can't believe I typed this all out. I wanted to address everything you said. Sorry?)  I agree whole-heartedly.   That sucks about your experience at Best Buy. Too many employees don't take the time to figure out what the pros of some of their products are before deciding that they aren't worth the money.   Unfortunately, it isn't uncommon to not get a lot of help if you already know what you're looking for. The sad truth is that with computers coming in and out constantly every few weeks, some employees just don't take the time to really get to know some of them. For example, the Surface looks like a more expensive version of the HP Split unless the manufacturer sends some trainings that distinguish it. If you came into the store having done extensive research on it, you'll probably know more than most of the associates.  I wish everyone came in having some sort of idea as to what they wanted and why. It'd make life a lot easier. Since the majority of people going into a brick and mortar store tend to be technophobes, you tend to oversimplify things and repeat them like clockwork. It can be hard to adjust to people who actually know what they're talking about. That said, those are always my favorite customers. Showing a Surface to someone who doesn't know the difference between Office and Windows is usually pretty depressing. But going into the gritty details about a Surface to someone who not only understands, but wants to listen to me geek out over it will always be my favorite part of the job. And if they know more than me, I can learn something to keep up with or teach the next guy.  That employee was just not doing his job correctly, whether it be out of personal bias, wanting to upsell, or simply unwillingness to learn about the product. I hate that that's the kind of experience that some people end of having because of incompetent employees.  I also agree with your thoughts on upselling. One reason is obviously because of that that push to perform, but sometimes ""upselling"" happens because some of us just love seeing people leave with good technology. It's soul-crushing to see people buy that $300 HP laptop, knowing that had they spent a little more they wouldn't have to be back in a year, even if it meant getting performance they didn't need. That being said, I don't think that Sales Associates who genuinely try to save their customers money are as rare as you'd think. We're people who (hopefully) enjoy our jobs and the company we work for. We want people to think of us as being a viable resource and appreciating what we're willing to do to provide them with good service. If I see a deal that I think is really good, you can bet I'll let you know. If you need me to find something for you, I'll do my best to find it. Something cheaper on Amazon? Fuck yeah, I'll match it for you. I want to have the best prices because it provides a better experience for both of us. You get a great deal, feel comfortable spending your time and money with me, and I feel great about helping you out. I like to hear that I'm doing my job well, and that you appreciate my time.

Surface,3cva9z,Domino584,22,Sat Jul 11 02:24:23 2015 UTC,"As someone who worked in retail, I can explain these things.  That salesman, every single day, deals with nothing but people who don't know how to shop online. We're talking the top tier of computer illiteracy.  So one of those people gets a Surface 3 and:   They get the 2GB version because it's cheaper and they don't understand how fucking RAM works They expect it to perform like their i5 desktop They load it full of nonsenseware that would make an i7 whimper   And as a result, they probably get an unhealthy number of returns and complaints, which happens way less on the (much more powerful and SSD-equipped) Pro models.  As long as you know what you're walking into (Bay Trail Atom-level CPU performance) and get around some of the goofier stuff (Installing h264ify on Chrome to save your battery when using Youtube), and are basically getting this thing as more of an iPad replacement than a Macbook one, you'll be fine.  It's tablet-level performance (and I'm talking 0.5-1.5 lb. tablets, not 3-5 lb. ""tablets"") with laptop-level functionality."
Surface,3cva9z,Dragonfruit_Pie,4,Sat Jul 11 04:14:50 2015 UTC,"Why does anyone use Chrome, outside of a desktop/android/ChromeOS is beyond me.  It's a RAM whore and your battery life suffers tremendously.  The difference between 10 hours of battery life, and 5, is what made me switch back to IE11 as my main.  Chrome is now my backup.  But I agree with this; when you purchase a Surface 3, don't expect SP3 performance.  Does it do everything else fine, without serious hickups, yes.  64-bit Bay Trail (Cherry Trail) is actually a lot better then what most people give it credit for."
Surface,3cva9z,ICantReadThis,2,Sat Jul 11 11:53:12 2015 UTC,IMO Opera is the way to go. Light. Non-intensive. And for a tablet (laptop?) The CPU and ram load is very light.

Surface,3cva9z,jussnf,2,Sat Jul 11 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"5 to 10% more achitectually, and I was right about to slam /u/ratshack because of that, but between the larger thermal headroom on Surface 3 (versus the 7-8in tablets that usually end up with a Bay Trail proc) and the 14nm die shrink, the difference is actually significantly higher (upwards of 75-100% higher) because it can maintain turbo speeds for much longer."

It wasn't until the 3D Mark ""Physics"" benchmark that it hit that significantly larger gap, and I had originally assumed that ""Physics"" was mostly a CPU benchmark; looks like it's heavily GPU-augmented now."

At that point, you know what you're dealing with. If he has an Apple logo on his shirt, he's paid by Apple to be there. He's not going to sell you a Surface. If he has a Microsoft shirt on, he's definitely not going to downplay the Surface 3.

Surface,3cva9z,timschwartz,16,Sat Jul 11 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"Actually the Surface 3 processor is very good for what it is. Its better than any other tablet processor out there, although NVidias tablet platform has better graphics acceleration of course. The problem with the Surface 3 is that its more tablet than laptop. That doesn't make it bad, it actually makes it the best tablet you can buy performance and feature wise. It's simply unbeatable in the tablet sector. However when it comes to laptops, the Surface 3 would be considered a low end performing laptop. Again this does not make the surface 3 bad. The surface 3 is an amazing machine. It has full windows 8.1/windows 10 on it. It can run all windows applications your used to using and will do so fairly well but it has its limitations. Its not compariable to a desktop cpu or a mid to higherend cpu just like tablets aren't either. So the surface 3 should really be considered the BEST tablet you can buy, but not the best laptop or even surface you can buy. If you step up to the i5 you will see significant performance gains. I've had both side by side and the i5 will out perform the surface 3 significantly... BUT the surface 3 is very usable for most things and certainly day to day things like browsing, watching youtube, netflix, office, email, skype... the surface 3 does all of that extremely well. Its a great machine for the cost. Again its more capable than ANY OTHER tablet on the market because its a full windows machine with usb3, usb2, video out, a pressure sensitive pen an amazing keyboard, can be used as laptop or tablet and has that wonderful kickstand. It also runs photoshop.   The surface 3 is for those looking for a more capable tablet that costs a little more than the other android/ios tablets. Surface has all the functionality android and ios lacks. Android and IOS is a severely limited environment. You can only do what they let you, which isn't much. For example mom bought an android tablet after I warned her about its limitations. On vacation she called to ask me how to connect her camera to it so she could load her pictures on to it and upload to facebook. Well you cant. You cant plug the camera directly to it and have it work, you cant use a usb card reader and she wasn't using a microSD card in her camera. Mom now has a Surface 3. Surface has all the applications those machines wish they had. It stands in a class of its own... BUT ITS NO SURFACE PRO. Its that simple. A surface 3 Pro is a laptop replacement and that's how Microsoft markets it. It has the full power of a laptop cpu in the most portable and highly attractive and revolutionary form factors available. For those not looking to spend as much as a surface 3 pro costs, and for those looking at androids and ios tablets... The surface 3 is aimed at them. Its a tablet that no other tablet can compete against it in terms of performance or function. To say the surface 3 is a bad machine would be ridiculous since it beats EVERY android/ios tablet on the market... but its no Surface 3 pro."
Surface,3cva9z,ColsonIRL,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"Basically, the Surface Pro is a laptop with a tablet form factor. The Surface is a tablet that runs x86 Windows. As long as you understand that you won't be disappointed."

I haven't done it yet but I'll be installing an emulator and using a USB controller to play a bunch of old console games too. Just don't count on playing a lot of new games, but most of those games don't play well on the SP3 either which is why I have a gaming desktop. People on here like to say the SP3 can be used for gaming but really it just scrapes by and has heat issues while doing it so IMO Id rather spend less on a Surface and use the leftover money for an actual gaming setup."

Surface,3cva9z,atrositus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:38:03 2015 UTC,"Well, once you add on both the Typecover and the Pen, you're looking at almost $800 for the full experience. At that point, you can find an i5 1080p laptop that isn't too bulky or heavy. It won't be nearly as portable, but you'd still get a decent laptop. Or, if you care less about specs, you could get one of the slightly lower end Lenovo Yogas and still get the portability, 2-in-1 functionality, and screen.  Neither of these would offer the Pen action though, which I'd argue is one of the Surface's best features. The Surface 3 is definitely the most versatile of the three, but with the price of the Typecover and the Pen, I think it's a harder sell than it should be. If a person isn't going to be making the most of that kind of versatility, I'd advise against it. If Microsoft could let you get the Surface 3 4GB, the Typecover, and the Pen for around $650-$700, I'd call it a no brainer, but otherwise it's just not a good fit for a lot of people."

Surface,3cva9z,Neosword3000,3,Sat Jul 11 10:34:25 2015 UTC,"Really, the only downside to the Surface 3 is the use of eMMC memory instead of a real SSD. Typical speeds range between ~120MB/s read, ~40MB/s write, 10-12MB/s 4k read/writes. SSDs quadruple that (and more). Even then, this isn't the slowest storage on a Windows tablet (T100 anyone, and that sub 80MB/s reads, 25MB/s write).  The processor is fairly strong, sporting a true Quad Core @ 1.6Ghz (Turbo to 2.4Ghz) paired with 4GB of RAM, and vastly improved iGPU. This little system is perfect for any general computing needs (Word, Excel, Youtube, netflix, reddit). Even some gaming can be had, as long as you like older games and don't mind lowering the graphic settings to lowest (in some cases). League of legends is acceptably playable on the Surface 3 (and when I say acceptable, 30fps with small dips here and there. 720p, lowest settings).   That BestBuy employee is just trying to up-sell you to the big one. Unless there are things you dont like about it (screen size, lack of storage) this is a good overall pickup.

As others have commented it is an amazing device that fits a certain need. Assess what you would like to do and what other computers you currently use. The S3 is a great companion device for a desktop or laptop and if you're casual an awesome primary.  My 2 cents on the matter.

Surface,3cva9z,ratshack,2,Sat Jul 11 02:09:37 2015 UTC,I have a Surface 3 and a Surface Pro 3.  Surface Pro 3: Gets real hot. Bigger - not as good of a tablet. Battery life is shorter.  Surface 3: Not as powerful. Screen is smaller (not as good as a laptop). On the positive side - I can charge it with an external battery because it uses a usb plug to charge.  It basically depends on what you want to do with it.  They are both great machines.  In my job I do a lot of writing.  I'm not editing videos or music.

They are trained to sell you shit and will literally say anything to steer you away from something in order to push products that are often much more expensive and powerful than what you actually need.  This is why I don't shop there. I buy all of my stuff online.  My advice would be to do your own research online and try out the device in a store if you can.
Surface,3cva9z,lfcabinash,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:26:25 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all. Or at least, it shouldn't be. Best Buy employees don't make commission, so they don't have a reason to upsell that high. Are they going to do everything they can to get the sale? Of course, it's their job. An AT&T worker isn't going to tell people that they should go to Verizon instead, regardless of whatever deals Verizon has at the time. He's been hired for a reason.   That being said, that employee is terrible at his job. He doesn't make commission so there really isn't any reason to downplay the Surface 3 and try to force a sale of a Pro 3. If he's concerned about his performance being low for whatever reason, Surface 3 sales are excellent for those sorts of trackers. He had no reason to downplay the Surface 3 that much unless he honestly thought it was bad. At that point, he's a terrible employee because he isn't doing his required trainings and is incredibly biased.  I firmly believe in Best Buy as a company and most of their practices. Obviously, not everyone is going to be perfect. Hopefully this employee gets his shit together or gets fired, because that is in no way good for business, nor good for his customers.   If you buy all your stuff online, sweet. I do 90% if my research and a large majority of my shopping online. It's a millennial thing. But don't think of Best Buy as some kind of scam.

Surface,3cvl5w,mtvee,2,Sat Jul 11 04:36:47 2015 UTC,I am a computer science doctoral student and use my Surface Pro 3 i7 w/ 8GB RAM model for most of my work now. My custom overclocked desktop machine still compiles code faster but this thing is not bad (and it fits in my lap on the couch... the desktop not so much haha).  Note that VS 2013 (and older versions) does not support touch screen scrolling (you have to use your arrow keys or touchpad scrolling or mouse scroll wheel). I think the newest VS version DOES support touch screen scrolling so you can move your fingers on the screen to scroll through your code like you would with a website or such on the tablet.

Surface,3cvl5w,CaptainIncredible,2,Sat Jul 11 05:50:37 2015 UTC,I run 2013 on SP3 for c++ projects (i5 4gb) and if you install this thing touch works. You will have a better time with a mouse and proper keyboard though.
Surface,3cvl5w,ZiggyZoomber,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:54:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, USB port stuff works and the official Microsoft ""Type Cover"" supports traditional laptop-like scrolling ability on its touchpad. If you get that, familiarize yourself with the things the Fn key can do: Fn+Capslock = FnLock (to make the Function keys behave like function keys, which is a big help for debugging in VS, because it uses those a lot). Fn+Arrow Keys = PgUp, PgDown, Home, End... this is helpful because turning on Fn-Lock changes the hardware Home/End/PgUp/PgDn keys into Function keys."

After visiting like 3 Microcenters and Best Buys, I called the MS Store assuming thy wouldn't have it and I'd have to buy it off eBay or something. Guy on the phone found one in their warehouse, overnight shipped it from warehouse to my house for free, and gave like a 15% discount because they didn't have any in stock and he felt bad.

They overnighted me a new one (packaging was garbage, but hey it's their thing not mine).  I forgot my Micro SD card in the old surface 3 that I sent back.  After receiving it they called me to let me know I should have it back in about 5 days.  I had written it off as a lost ~$25 and wasn't really worried as there was no personal info on it.  Good on them for doing a proper inspection and sending back the card no cost to me.  Now...  That packaging.  They basically placed the S3 in a 1"" box with one layer of small bubble bubble wrap draped around it.  The wrap was not secured in any way and the device was just sliding around in the box.  It appears they are using the same box as the Pro3 for returns just with an insert to hold the S3.  What I'm getting at here is that I could have sent back a device with a cracked screen and said ""Well, it happened in transit, you didn't give me proper packaging"" and I don't think they could have argued with me on that."

I have the SP3 i5 and used it almost exclusively for note taking in my spring semester. It was great, my notes were neat and well organized. I personally enjoy the size of the device as it replicates the feeling of a notebook very well.  That said, I believe the size and the power behind it to be unnecessary if you are basically only using the device for notes.  I would suggest the S3 and grab at least a pen, and if you are really feeling good about the purchase grab a type cover too. Realize that the type cover is also an extra for the pro models, so one way or another you are throwing down a hundred more bucks for that functionality."

Surface,3cv9me,Wobbling,3,Sat Jul 11 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"The battery is alright, the problem is charging speed. The worst case is you may have to charge it every night, over night. I get consistance 7-8 hrs guranteed out of S3, it should be enough for a day. And, you can always pack a battery bank with at least 5V 2A output, and charge your S3 while you are between class, or walking, or having lunch... just connect it to your battery and put it in your bag.  The charging speed was my only concern before I bought my S3. I still think it is a problem after 3 weeks. It has caused minor inconvinient at times, so whenever someone asks me about S3, the charging speed is the sure thing I'll mention, but it is definitely not a deal breaker for me, and I believe it shouldn't be a problem for most user."

The prices for Surface devices are the same everywhere but El Corte Ingles uses to give the best service in case something goes wrong. They will probably offer you to buy an additional three years assurance for any kind of damage or malfunction. Notice that you have a mandatory two years warranty for any device purchased anywhere in Europe.   If you are from the US it's more expensive to purchase in Europe than in your country right now, but you can obtain a tax exemption as a tourist. That amounts for 21 percent of the price.

Surface,3csvvw,Whatchamazog,4,Fri Jul 10 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"I think I've found the solution to your problem.  First you open the PDF in your favourite PDF viewer, for now let's say it's Edge.  Open OneNote, create a new Section in a notebook. Go to View Tab, choose Hide Page Title, this will save you some space overhead. Click on Paper Size, a side bar will appear, click on ""Save current page as template"", enter template name, select the ""Set as default template for pages in current section"" check box. Now you are ready for inserting the PDF.  Next switch back to your PDF Viewer, open print dialog, select ""Send to OneNote"" and print out.  Switch back to OneNote, it will ask you where to put this printout, select the current ""Section"", not page, section!  Now you'll see each page of the PDF is in this section as its own page. Now to avoid moving things around, you right click on the printout image of the page you work on, select ""Set image as background"". OneNote automatically index all text it can recognize in a picture, so you can use search to find things you need. The only downside is links inside the PDF.  Hope this helped."

Surface,3cqhan,jakeisabear,23,Thu Jul 9 23:24:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a developer and use my Surface Pro 3 for 99% of tasks.  The only thing I don't use it for is to run my virtual machine host with 20+ VM's and my SQL Server database.  Both of those are in my basement and are remotely accessible.  However, those could easily be located in the cloud, I'm just cheap so I keep them on the LAN.  My Surface is docked and hooked up to two 27"" monitors and together with itself that's a 3 monitor solution with a ton of USB ports, full-size keyboard, mouse etc.  It's a desktop in everything but name.  I love to tell the story of when the Surface paid for itself.  I got an automated email from one of my customers platforms that the system went hard-down.  I connected in RDP and eventually figured out there was a software problem.  I had to remote-debug to my lab with Visual Studio to isolate what was going on.  Since all my code and dev environment is on my Surface I was able to make the fix, check it in, build it, test it in the lab, and deploy remotely to the customer site.  All from my comfy(ish) seat.  Not that super-impressive until you realize all of this took place in a commercial jet with airplane wifi, at 40,000 feet 7 hours from a power outlet.  Good luck doing that with a desktop.  IMHO a Surface Pro 3 is the perfect development platform.  I've had a new machine every 2 years since I started as a developer and that was 20 years ago.  This is by far and above the favorite dev platform I've ever had.  All my products are million+ line codebases so I don't use it lightly."
Surface,3cqhan,limitless__,5,Fri Jul 10 00:39:56 2015 UTC,"This is my scenario as well.  VMs in a 2U ProLiant, everything else goes with me plus a few 64GB micro SDs.  Compilers, games, code trees, docs, airplane movies, it's all there.  Dock it and i get more screen real estate, gigabit LAN, more ports and full-size peripherals. Everything not in the cloud is on a removable medium in case i lose or damage it and have to reinstall.  I also keep a bare-metal restoration image on a stick so if it goes down on the road i can bring it back up."
Surface,3cqhan,FiatMortem,17,Fri Jul 10 01:42:45 2015 UTC,"Surface can handle standard use cases for the vast majority of people (who really only use a web browser and Office). I'm a gamer so I still need a desktop, but everyone else I know and in my family, not so much. However, a cheap PC with giant monitor is often a better package for most people too: better bang for the buck compared to Surface.  Any Surface product is mostly aimed at the mobility worker/user. If you're not going to be using the tablet PC/hybrid off-charger, there's no point in getting it over a cheaper desktop/laptop these days."

Yes, I could edit my website, use Lightroom, or do video editing on my Surface... but why would I want to?  I have a virtual throne with loads of screen real estate, a real mouse and a real, full size keyboard.  More often than not, the desktop offers a superior experience.  I'm sure there are countless applications in the business world where the exclusive use of tablets would be impractical.  I worked in a TV newsroom for four years.  If producers and writers had to do all their work on small tablets, it would be an absolute nightmare."
Surface,3cqhan,nx_2000,11,Fri Jul 10 00:16:09 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree about the value of a desktop setup, but a Surface Pro model can be configured to work identically to your configuration with the use of a dock.

Surface,3cqhan,lonaysta,12,Fri Jul 10 07:00:28 2015 UTC,"I've got to disagree with you.  I make stuff.  Lots of stuff.  I've been a developer (web, mobile, etc.) for years and years.  My SP3 is my primary workhorse.  I do real development work using Visual Studio 2013, PHP Storm, MySQL, MS SQL, Photoshop, IIS, Apache, virtual machines and a bunch of other crap.  I do all of this on my SP3 with ease.  I have a Macbook I never use, and I got rid of my i7, 16gb ram laptop because I was no longer using it.  My SP3 works just as well  and better than any laptop I've used.  The touch screen alone is a huge productivity boost.  AND, I can turn it into a tablet whenever I want.  I can continue working or I can goof off in reddit or whatever with my SP3 in portrait mode and type out posts with my thumbs like I am doing now.  Its BETTER than any laptop I own or use, including a Macbook.  When I first bought it, I thought ""I'm going to need more desktop!  I'll buy extra monitors and use them to extend the desktop.""  Honestly, I rarely use those as well.  I have a few servers on my LAN but I rarely sit in front of them anymore.  I have a high end desktop that I only use for high end 3D and Oculus VR dev, and maybe some high end gaming. I have a Mac mini, haven't booted it up in months.   I'm sure there are countless applications in the business world where the exclusive use of tablets would be impractical.   Where exclusive use of a Surface Pro 3 in the business world woukd be impractical?  Other than high end 3D rendering, number crunching, massive server applications, very high end gaming... I can think of any.  You are aware that an SP3 can be used like a laptop and has specs that rival many laptops/desktops, right?  Mine is an i5 with 8GB of ram, 256GB hard drive, and an 8hr battery life.  I know MANY people in the workforce using desktops/laptops much shittier than that.  But of course, if you statement was not referring to SP3s and instead talked about iPads or Android tablets not suitable for the workplace then, yes, I'd agree with you.  I have a bunch of those too and rarely use them - those are toys."
Surface,3cqhan,CaptainIncredible,2,Fri Jul 10 02:08:13 2015 UTC,"My job requires me to have a shitload of ram, a high end video card that supports multiple 4K monitors and high end CPU. I have tried using my SP to do some work at home and it really doesn't cut it. at all.  Also, outside of work, I do digital artwork, and the surface is great for me to get something started with but I end up with 1gb or larger photoshop files that bring the Surface to its knees, and eventually I have to switch over to my real computer to finish the piece.  IMO, the Surface Pro is awesome, and it could replace a PC for some people, but like I said elsewhere, most people could replace a PC with an iPad and still do the same exact thing they say they need a computer for. Maybe not you or me, but I would say that the majority of people don't need or really know how to use a computer.... they know how to use facebook and email and shop on amazon, and they can do that with a Surface Pro, or spend way less and do it with an iPad."

Surface,3cqhan,nx_2000,6,Fri Jul 10 02:26:09 2015 UTC,"You have a valid point, its kind of pointless to pay $1000+ for an SP3 when a $200 generic box will fill one's needs.  But then you really can't refer to the SP3 as a 'portable toy'.  By your own admission, it has more power and more portability than some people need.  And 'make stuff'?  The SP3 is the most versatile and productive machine I've ever owned.  And I've owned lots of stuff...  And I use my SP3 to make lots and lots and lots of stuff."

Surface,3cqhan,themadturk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:14:18 2015 UTC,"I have a quad core, 32GB RAM workstation, that I seldomly use because just riding and working with my Surface Pro 2 is able to break many of my blocks, rather than be office/desk bound. My workstation also has an Intuos 4, that I can't bear to use, because of the screen/drawing disconnects.  The only way the multi-monitor has is more real-estate, but most of my work is basically focused on one or two windows, or three, but not at the same time. I can swap between windows or Modern IE. I can snap a calculator and OneNote my calculations. The multiple monitors is more screen real-estate to rudimentary cursor drag for menus and applications at that.  Now for tablets (not tablet PCs)? Those are purely consuming, no power work devices, that I don't prefer. They are dummy terminals, like the one picked up in Space Quest IV, to then detect those droids as you get to the core... I view exclusive sole use of those tablets in that area.  Surface Pros, can augment, supplement, compliment, and work with heavy lifters as sometimes I had to do, to offload processing. But more than whatnot, I find most of my work to be able with my Surface Pro 2.  Typing on the Type Cover/Power Cover is like working with my K520, keys are shallow for comfortable travel, versus long travel of mechanical keyboards too. The key sizes are the same, so I am very much at home still, respectively."

I watch HD video, play some light games like Hearthstone and Minecraft, edit documents in Office, write programs with any variety of text editor, and do some drafting in AutoCAD. As a ""true computer,"" it works great for me.  More graphics-demanding video games will start to tax any Surface, but even League of Legends with reduced settings works fine for others on this sub.  Just for context, I do NOT have any other computer like a more powerful desktop. The SP3 handles all my tasks well enough. Would I play more games if I had a machine with better graphics?

For those who use these devices for everything, how comfortable is it when typing? Also, doesn't being hunched over a small device lead to neck strain? Wrist strain, on-the-go?

Waiting rarely is the best option, especially when it comes to new tech gadgets.

Outside of that, who knows if the SP4 is even going to ship this year. From what I've read it doesn't look good. This coming from a guy who JUST got a new SP3.   A little SGA for those who don't already know but you can save a ton by going to your local USPS and picking up one of those movers coupon books, inside there's a 10% off coupon from Best Buy. If you're a student, you can register on BB's website for student deals and save am additional $100. I got my i5 128gb for around $740 and change."
Surface,3crqhq,ogkoreanjesus,3,Fri Jul 10 23:44:35 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you should wait as long as you can before you need it. I doubt the SP4 will release before August/September, at least it won't if they plan on the new Skylake CPUs.  You can pick up a SP3 pretty cheap used, if the latest and greatest is really important to you, I'd say buy a used i3 on Amazon or Ebay, and sell it when the SP4 comes out."

Based on your vague description yes the surface is right for you and yes you should wait until after windows 10 drops. Why? Student discounts will appear closer to august/september, the SP4 may release after windows 10 and if the sp4 does not release than you may want to wait just a little bit to see if there are any firmware/os issues with your necessary school programs and with the surface tablet itself(Maybe Windows 10 drains the battery too fast etc...)"
Surface,3crqhq,LegendaryAura,2,Fri Jul 10 06:55:02 2015 UTC,"I would wait for the back to school sales if you don't need one now.  I would go with the surface as I used spiral notebooks, a tablet, and a chrome book prior and the surface pro made it so much more convenient to take notes by transferring powerpoint lectures onto onenote and taking notes on the slides and not having to worry about losing the notes and having it all organized for you.  I had a regular laptop that I didn't take to classes unless I needed them for a reason as it was just too bulky to carry"
Surface,3crqhq,jp205,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:16:16 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest you to wait for the Pro4 if you don't really need it now. However, if you don't expect to play games on the surface AND your school work does not involve CPU intensive task such as CAD design or heavy programming, then you should consider the new Surface 3. It is lighter, battery lasts longer, no heat, no fan noise, free office 365 for a year. To me it is a better device for typical student use case."

Keep in mind that the S3 is akin to an ultrabook. It is not built for gaming like a Nvidia Shield. Running a game like LOL may be able to run just barely. Adding an SRS on top of that, even something as light as Xsplit, would tip out. Not only is the game reading and writing to the SSD, but so is the SRS. Same goes with RAM. And, as the SRS is also rendering video, the onboard graphics are going to be running along with the game.    Short version: Gaming on a Surface, even a Pro, is pushing it. Recording said gameplay won't give you quality results, that is, if it works at all.   Solution: If you are very serious about recording gameplay ( for some reason on your surface ) get an hdpvr. Take the output from the surface and run it through the hdpvr. It's a separate unit that records the video going through it. So no load is put on your Surface.  Hope this helps."

Surface,3cpklw,cale2k,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you can mount it as a folder if its formatted exfat.  You might be able to unmount it and remount it as a folder, worth a try anyway.  Worse case you just reformat to NTFS.  I have had no issues with NTFS; it's not the standard for SD cards but it should work just fine."

Surface,3cqaqh,nomadsfp,5,Thu Jul 9 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"I bought a SP3 early this year with hopes of playing League, and a few other games on it.  I bought the i5/256gb/8gb ram version.  After noticing that I would hook it up to a bigger monitor, had a usb splitter so i could hook up a micro keyboard and a mouse, and would have a fan blowing on it cause the SP3's get hella hot...I realized I should have just bought an actual laptop that would have no issue playing these games.  I ended up selling it and getting a gaming laptop for $999 off Newegg.  If you plan on gaming more than like 60% of the time you're on the thing...don't buy one for gaming.  (Also the games ran OK on low settings)"

Simply looking at D2 long doors will give you sub-30 FPS if there are teammates nearby (not on screen). 10 FPS during long doors firefight with flashbang. Basically unplayable at a competitive level.   League of Legends   Medium settings and 1280x720 60 FPS with no action ~50 FPS with minions walking through lane ~40 FPS with 3 people in lane farming   Dota 2   Low settings and 1024x768 35-40 FPS while standing at tower with one other hero 20-30 FPS while farming with 4 players in lane. Less with camera moving and spells. Basically unplayable.

Edit: if you're charging it with a low-wattage charger (1A or less) and actively using the S3, it will use more power than it's receiving. The Surface will think it's charging (because it's plugged into a power source), but it will slowly use battery power and will shut down once it gets too low."

It doesn't support high DPI screens.  Most importantly though, it doesn't integrate with Action Center in Windows 10.  The only way a unified notification center works is if it is just that- unified.  Forcing a desktop app on users that uses its own notification method is just plain stupid.  Yes, eventually we're getting a Universal Skype app (well, according to what Microsoft has said, there will be three purpose-driven apps:  messaging, calls, video calls, which means that if you want the full Skype experience you'll still be using the desktop Skype app and missing those features).  ...

I've played with SP3's at the MS store, and if you push hard while drawing, (like I do), you're likely to mess the screen up, also, the adjustable kickstand doesn't stay in the same place if you push real hard, which should be expected.

Since you have the exact same setup as I do I'll go ahead and try out that link you posted and see how it works for me."
Surface,3cnn3o,kryptonnms,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"Np. Yeah. I have a lot of SAI commands tied to mine using the radial menu, so I couldn't be without those.  Also, once you're done and you have it calibrated and your buttons and menus set up again, use the tablet preferences utility to back up the settings.  I've noticed, sometimes they get erased and my calibration, buttons and radial menu goes with it, so then I can just re-load the backed up prefs and up and running again."
Surface,3cnn3o,kryptonnms,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:54:28 2015 UTC,Just finished running the new calibration tool and definitely notice a difference when using my brushes in photoshop. Funny enough I tried setting SAI up but could never really get it working with my surface. As for the radial menu Ive never touched it so I might have to look into it as I compare the two when the SP3 arrives later today. The more I read the less people seem to like the new pen it has.
Surface,3cnn3o,triffid_boy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  for SAI, I had to edit a configuration file (misc or something like that) to allow the Wacom driver instead of SAI to control the pen, and that stopped all the touchscreen issues when working in SAI.  Yeah. The only good thing I hear about the pen is the accuracy...which is nice, but losing that customization hurts."
Surface,3cnn3o,HolographicSocks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:29:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll really notice the difference with the pen, (I'm guessing that's your main concern). You may notice some improvements at the edges, as I hear that's superior in the SP3.   I have a surface pro 2 and I do prefer the fact that the pen is not battery powered, but that's it. I think you'll be even happier with the SP3!"
Surface,3cnn3o,plus1zero,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:12:03 2015 UTC,I went ahead and ordered the SP3 i3 model and should be arriving some time today. I'll play with the pen a bit and compare it to my SP1 with the fix Krypto posted below. Also I'll get to see how much the 30GB of space will hurt.
Surface,3cnn3o,plus1zero,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:01:37 2015 UTC,"May I ask if this is from an independent seller, or is this a sale on a third party website? Just wondering since it sounds like a decent deal."

Even though I don't use but abouT 10GB on my 128 of personal stuff, I like having the extra there in case I need it.  But, I briefly had an i3 before I switched it to my i5, and it definitely runs cooler and is super quick and snappy."
Surface,3cp28f,ATRAZiiNE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:03:30 2015 UTC,"I would search other listings via CL & Ebay to see the going price.  It being a bundle doesnt necessarily mean you will get much of a higher price, just depends on the buyer.  My best advice is be realistic of it's current value vs what you paid for it in 2013.  I see a lot of people selling SP3 bundles for $100 less than what they paid when there has been various price drops during that time."
Surface,3cp28f,MoggX,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:19:54 2015 UTC,I actually paid 600 dollars for it a couple months ago with accessories and all. I only got it for the purpose of using it for school and now that I am not going back I dont feel the same need for it.

Surface,3cnry3,gainiter,2,Thu Jul 9 09:56:26 2015 UTC,"Only 3 hours? I know I have the el cheapo i3 version but even playing games I get almost 6 hours.  Make sure that you have bare minimum going on in the background first and foremost. You might also want to declutter the device and do the typical spring cleaning that all these devices need.  I would recommend going to task manager > startup > and turning off anything you absolutely do not need. You could have skype and any number of other things powering on by default burning resources.  Next I would look at msconfig and see what services are starting up. Do a Google search and verify what you are turning off but certain things like Windows Indexing run periodically and can burn resources. You may or may not ever use the Windows Key+Q search option to pull up program thus negating this particular service.  Finally be aware of your power setting and give them a critical look as you may be able to adjust screen brightness and default dimming/screen off times to better suit your usage.  Also make sure to turn off Bluetooth and possibly Wifi if they are not needed.  You can also look at your Onedrive if you are using that, if it is syncing data in the background that could cause excessive resource usage.  The biggest thing would be to read up pretty much any laptop optimization guide and go from there as I used that on my Surface Pro and have no issues getting 8+ hours as 75% brightness on Wifi with no bluetooth.  Good Luck!"

Surface,3coimu,stev3french93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:12:31 2015 UTC,Can you install through the ISO method on Microsoft's site or do you need to install Win10 through windows update for a Surface?
Surface,3coimu,dathar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"Both is doable. I've extracted the ISO and installed Win10 on some of the work SP3 test stations. For my personal one, I just upgraded my 8.1 install thru Windows Update"
Surface,3coimu,stev3french93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:07:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! Just wanted to make sure it would be ok upgrading through the ISO. Win Update is blocked here at my workplace.
Surface,3coimu,orbitalinterceptor,2,Thu Jul 9 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"Depending on how you use onedrive I'd avoid 10 for now.   Placeholder files are gone, so it's either sync everything or pick and choose folders, instead of the W8 method of showing all files regardless of offline status. I find onedrive in 10TP nigh unusable."
Surface,3coimu,orbitalinterceptor,2,Thu Jul 9 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"I want my work account to sync just everything and my personal account to sync just documents but not music/pictures/movies.  By pick and chose folders you mean, that the folders themselves are shown anyway but the content is only shown, when it's stored on the hard drive?  If so - what are the benefits? Do we have at least a good search for online stuff or do we have improved OneDrive app where everything is shown?"
Surface,3coimu,orbitalinterceptor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"They're still working on implementation for onedrive, which will be baked into the OS this time around instead of being a separate app. In W8 you can see the entire online folder and file directory whether it is available on the machine or is in the cloud and, through the app or file explorer, select online or offline availability. In the current builds, you select which folders to sync at setup, and nothing else is visible. To get at other files you need to go to the website and view your cloud storage there.  For example, I selected to sync my documents folder but not a folder with digital comics.  When I open onedrive, I can only see the documents folder.  If I want any of the digital comics, I have to go to onedrive online and download them.   It is quite annoying after the implementation in W8.  They will have a better solution eventually, but for now, sucky."

I could not imagine going back to 8 at this point, I just recently upgraded my desktop as well. I didn't expect to like 10 more than 7, but honestly 10 is the best desktop environment I have used to date.

Surface,3cjis7,Congenital-Optimist,2,Wed Jul 8 20:20:56 2015 UTC,Microsoft's never really been on the ball when it comes to keeping up with Intel's schedule. I wouldn't be surprised if they release a Broadwell SP4 right before Intel releases Skylake.
Surface,3cjis7,poopyheadthrowaway,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly. They've already missed the window to release a Broadwell refresh. This would have allowed them to retain the same form factor, maintain compatibility with existing accessories, and keep interest up. It could have been accompanied by other minor updates; better cameras, better anti-reflective screen coating, other subtle improvements. However, this window has probably passed, and now people are going to expect a much bigger change, which puts them in the difficult position of keeping the same form factor to appease business customers who invested early in these devices, which pisses off the regular consumer who expects a more rapid rate of change, or vice-versa, pissing off the business customers who expected longer-term accessory compatibility."
Surface,3cjis7,zhenya00,2,Thu Jul 9 11:10:09 2015 UTC,"I think that's what they're trying to get you to do.  At the same time, my Dell laptop is slowly breaking down, so I have a finite amount of time before I need a new PC.  If the 4 is available when that happens, I'll get one (assuming they don't ruin with a Core M or something).  If not, I'll probably get an XPS 13 or similar.  Microsoft's refusal to speak about the SP4 is very much starting to rub me the wrong way."
Surface,3cjis7,talkincat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:15:49 2015 UTC,Its a good idea to wait till win 10 sense it's so close. Hopefully they at least refresh the keyboard to get rid of the charms like they did for the surface 3.

Intel delayed Broadwell so much that Microsoft just couldn't wait any longer so they improvised.  It would be what the SP3 was always meant to be.
Surface,3cjis7,N19h7m4r3,7,Wed Jul 8 13:18:57 2015 UTC,"I doubt that SP3 was meant to be fanless since they spent o much time on designing that incredible thin fan and everything. I really hope the SP4 comes with a fan aswell, I want to replace my laptop not buy another tablet."
Surface,3cjis7,foyamoon,0,Wed Jul 8 13:08:36 2015 UTC,"Intel's Skylake   When Skylake Revision comes out, Microsoft will work to have these upgraded chips put into the Surface Pro 3/4. My conversation with Microsoft is that they will need at least 2 months to develop a Surface with the new Chipset... Unfortunately, it can't happen over night. I expect to see a new surface in 2016, not before."
Surface,3cjis7,theville90,8,Wed Jul 8 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but I'm looking for some insight -- If Intel releases Skylake in early August, does that mean Microsoft engineers don't get to see the new processor until then?  The same time as consumers?  I would think that big companies like MS and Intel would be working together and MS would get ""early looks"".  At the very least, if the new processor is being released to the public soon, that means it's finalized.  Is this just not how things work?"
Surface,3cjis7,jemesnyc,6,Wed Jul 8 14:50:17 2015 UTC,You are absolutely right. Intel and MS work very tight togheter. A SP4 showcasing the new Skylake would be great for Intel aswell. Apple also work close with Intel and they always invite some top dog from Intel to the stage at keynotes to talk about the journey togheter and whatnot.
Surface,3cjis7,foyamoon,4,Wed Jul 8 15:26:47 2015 UTC,"August release will be desktop cpu not the SKL-U which is what would be used.  That isn't expected in quantity until January.  I'm certain MS has pre-pro Skylake processors and is engineering everything the best they can, but until you can commit to a final product and have the quantity in the supply channel, there isn't anything to release."
Surface,3cjis7,Star-Bellied-Sneech,2,Wed Jul 8 17:28:20 2015 UTC,I thought some on the U series was coming out in September?  http://www.itworld.com/article/2926714/hardware/purported-skylake-release-schedule-leaked.html
Surface,3cjis7,mokasakin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:52:15 2015 UTC,"You've spoken with someone over at Microsoft about this before?  Any idea why it does take them so long to integrate new chips from Intel? They do seem to generally launch really late in chip cycles, causing the Surface Pro line to be awkwardly out of step and on last generation chips for extended periods. Other manufacturers clearly aren't needing that long to integrate the new chips."
Surface,3cjis7,caliber,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:32:03 2015 UTC,"The Surface 3 was a day 0 launch partner for the new Atom chips.  I suspect the answer is that they were still getting their groove going - they were still spending so much time improving the form factor that the chips were secondary.  I suspect they'll just skip broadwell altogether and go with Skylake, though.  Not sure if that's feasible."
Surface,3cjis7,dislikes_redditors,-1,Wed Jul 8 14:56:31 2015 UTC,They can just refresh the current product and keep calling it S3/SP3.
Surface,3cjis7,oZiix,4,Thu Jul 9 02:53:50 2015 UTC,Pulling the trigger on the SP3 if offered in the huge Amazon sale next week
Surface,3cjis7,Nikola_Mirotic,7,Wed Jul 8 14:55:20 2015 UTC,Every single Surface Pro 3 user just rejoiced in glory.
Surface,3cjis7,jerhms,5,Wed Jul 8 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly.  I've had my SP3 for something like a year now... it's still a fantastic machine, but because I'm a tech whore I'm chomping at the bit for a 4 already... but, having spent right around $2k for it, including accessories, which isn't exactly pocket change for me, I'm strangely happy with the 4 not being out yet, and maybe not for a while longer... if nothing else it'll make it easier to justify another $2k purchase to my wife if it's closer to two years old!"
Surface,3cjis7,fzammetti,3,Wed Jul 8 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"Considering mine does what I need it to do, I wouldn't upgrade even if they released SP4 today. I can see myself going with the SP3 for a couple of years at least before I need an upgrade."

Surface,3cjis7,Grenne,2,Wed Jul 8 19:43:26 2015 UTC,fair enough :) I know someone who keeps purposely breaking his phones to get better ones (to the point of hotwiring it so it melts) so after all of that I am kind of like /teeth grating/ lol.

Surface,3cjis7,Grenne,3,Wed Jul 8 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"oh good, a rehash of that ""leaked"" report that said that these 20 (I thought it was 25?) million SSD's are going to Microsoft and apple. No breakdown of the numbers, so for all we know it could be %90 Apple destined.   Also, the orginal chinese ""leak"" was translated so badly that it was impossible to tell if these were going to start shipping at the end of next year, beginning of next year, end of next year or some combo of all three.   In short, this is another cycle of rehashing a truly low information rumor and essentially clickbait. fail.   I do think SP4 is possible in 2016, but only because that is (so far) when Intel says the CPU will be ready. Assuming MS sticks with the same class of CPU, that is."
Surface,3cjis7,ratshack,3,Wed Jul 8 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"This doesn't make any sense at all. If these tablets are on a yearly-ish cycle now [which seems to be the case] then second half of 2016 would be an ideal time for a SP5, why would it hold up the SP4? Right now the SP4 can get Skylake, which is a pretty significant upgrade over Haswell, then the SP5 would get Skylake refresh or Kaby Lake [neither of which will be a huge jump over Skylake] but also NVMe storage."
Surface,3cjis7,ThatActuallyGuy,2,Wed Jul 8 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"As a Day-1 owner of a Surface Pro 3, this is great, i can use my device for a long time before feeling the undeniable urge to go and buy a new gadget."

They should know that it takes a couple years to get a product out the door, and they've got to get parts together and start building months (at least!) before launch. February or March would be the perfect time to order important parts for the SP5 to get it ready for an August/September release."

Surface,3cjis7,haXona,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:02:46 2015 UTC,"""couple of months"" is not confirmed...this could be a year from now. Also in terms of current processor manufacturing and design processes we are seeing the law of diminishing returns starting to play a role. Sure surface pro to surface pro 3 is a HUGE jump in performance, but don't expect the pro 3 to pro 5 for example to be anywhere near that leap in terms of raw power."
Surface,3cjis7,LegendaryAura,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:07:28 2015 UTC,"It isnt so much about a performance boost as a way for me as a customer to know that I have the latest thing and not something from early 2014 in 2016.  Also a lot of the problems in the SP3 would be on MS' radar right now meaning hopefully less problems like the throttling issue. And of course battery life, I hope skylake will be a big difference here also I expect a higher battery lide either way. Performance on an i3 is already good since 2014 so I'm okay with whichever one I choose, I just dont want to feel like my 1500$ device is ""outdated after some months"

Surface,3cmr9r,50PercentLies,8,Thu Jul 9 02:55:01 2015 UTC,"To clarify, someone brought up this issue in a reddit AMA a few months ago. one of the surface team members responded and said that the issue can be resolved with a higher voltage pen with a boosted signal, but no one has heard anything about this since. Basically we think he was full of crap."
Surface,3cmr9r,tycho5ive,4,Thu Jul 9 03:19:16 2015 UTC,"I tried it out carefully at a Microsoft store last week.  The pen jitter issue was definitely still there, although my impression was that it was slightly better on the Surface 3 compared to the SP3.  (Maybe that's wrong.)  I wanted to leave with a new machine, but the jitter was still unacceptable for me.    This particular MS store, in Los Angeles, had huge issues with their display units, though.  It took trying a couple machines to get one where the pen worked at all."
Surface,3cmr9r,qurun,3,Thu Jul 9 03:15:15 2015 UTC,"Sadly some of the store demos are in bad shape, and don't leave a good impression."
Surface,3cmr9r,RedditUser256,3,Thu Jul 9 07:20:44 2015 UTC,"I also have this problem, I've not had my SP2 long, but I was aware of it after doing research while purchasing.   However, I had a realisation on how to make it better, it might not be the most practical method, but If you lower the resolution it increases the accuracy. The lower the better, but the further you go, you lose some ability to run metro apps as the resolution is too small.  I've settled on 1360x768 - as it also maintains aspect ratio. I originally went lower which basically fixed the issue, but got the message about the metro apps not able to run at that res.  I had this idea to lower the resolution as I'd been using an upgraded Motion Computing LE1600 for 2 years and it had a bigger screen, lower DPI and naturally lower screen resolution than what we use, and it's pretty much perfect accuracy to draw on, as its Wacom. So, a shot in the dark helped.  Edit: heres an image example - Imgur  notice the big difference 6 pixels can make? my hand still wobbles but there's no jitter"
Surface,3cmr9r,Banana_Kama,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:10:33 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that as well. When I'm drawing, I almost always have to draw zoomed in to minimize the jitters."

Which makes me think that it's a pretty significant problem that's causing the jitters. I have no idea if anyone else has lowered the resolution, but it's probably the best option. Plus the god damn UI on Surface Pro 2 is far too tiny at full resolution, kinda better this way."
Surface,3cmr9r,Banana_Kama,2,Thu Jul 9 14:42:28 2015 UTC,"Lol of course not. Its barely even been acknowledged, much less addressed."

Surface,3cmr9r,poopyheadthrowaway,2,Thu Jul 9 05:12:12 2015 UTC,"This is what the surface team said in a Reddit ama three months ago...  ""Hey this is StevieB, working on it… we noticed this happening in a very specific instance. Likely when you draw really slow and across the diagonal of the screen… so it is quote a specific instance specific. It is really hard to a draw a straight line without the use of a ruler or the digitizer picking up the jitter in your hands… so that is why people use a ruler to do this test.. but the ruler messes up the signal as it capacitivly couples . Most touch sensors are oriented as a grid, when you draw across the diagonal the touch controller has to interpolate position of the pen and linearize its path. As for active capacitive digitizer we’re the best out there! But we can do better. One of the improvement just involves boosting the voltage of the pen. So I cannot give you a timeline, but just know things are in the hopper. Other digitizer techs have other artifacts and issues, they don’t do linearization as well, and have accuracy issues. Pen is really important to us, and our best people are really focused on making and maintaining it to be awesome and the most realistic digital pen experience in any tablet!""  and responded to a similar question...  ""Hey this is StevieB, if I understand your question correctly what you are seeing is a linearization issue.. and has nothing to do with the pressure sensor. This artifact likely happens only when you draw really slow and across the diagonal. Most touch sensors are oriented as a grid, when you draw across the diagonal the touch controller has to interpolate position of the pen and linearize its path. As for active capacitive digitizer we do the best out there, but we can do better. We do so by boosting the signal from the Pen and the bettering the controller… Surface 3 takes a step in that direction.

The only 2 good things are Retina display and console with unix commands and sh scripts - but if you want to use console, linux is always better choice.   It causes so many problems, that it's hard to believe - lack of good software, constant crashes, right mouse button problems, disappearing cursor, strange buttons mapping, getting loud as yet when trying to compile something etc.  And to make it worse you have to heavily customize it to use it properly, because by default the system is not comfortable to do anything useful.  Before I stared to using Mac, my opinion on this computers and Apple as company was neutral. Now after half a year of using one, I absolutely hate it, and will stay away from Apple products. For the same amount of money I could just buy 2 computers with much better specs, and I use it only because I'm forced to.   At this moment I much prefer using my Surface Pro 1 for coding that my business mac, even considering much lower specs of SP1 and smaller screen.

Surface,3chmt0,Jablooglius,8,Wed Jul 8 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"I bet the Surface line up is probably the best selling 2-in-1 product by far.     The Surface branding to me is the most marketable Windows product that also brings excitement.  More people are familiar with it than any other Windows device.  The rest of the vendors are all over the place.  While the current Dell XPS 13 is excellent, a lot of their previous XPS were crap.  It also gets lost in the 20 other versions of Inspirons, Latitudes, Vostros, etc.    Same with HP.  There are too many ""Envy"" variants."
Surface,3chmt0,MoggX,3,Wed Jul 8 07:18:31 2015 UTC,"When I looked at the market when I was interested in a pen/touch tablet PC, there was one made by Samsung, ATIV the Smart PC Pro. This was in the market months earlier than the first Surface Pro. This PC has identical specs in terms of computing to the first Surface Pro, a mobile Ivy Bridge i5, 128GB of SSD, 4GB RAM. And was in a tablet PC form factor with a detachable keyboard....  The problem? The reviews of Amazon that I looked at from other people mentioned the docked keyboard held no weight, doesn't even have a separate battery ala Power Cover. Because of this and no kickstand, the ""laptop"" mode is disappointing to some, not being able to be stabile propped up, unless at the angle much like the first kickstand option of the first Surface Pro. And also because of the mechanical reliance of forcing the contacts together versus the spring-ball option of the Type/Touch/Power Covers, users would complain about keyboard disconnects while using the device, because it would come loose, also due to the top heavy tablet PC section versus the keyboard dock.  The keyboard dock won't even fold back, so in order to convert to a ""tablet/slate"" mode, one would have to (in my opinion, awkwardly) rip and stow the keyboard device. This additional stress to the mechanical latches also wore with time, and further adds to the keyboard connectivity issues.  Since then, Lenovo has the Helix, Wacom themselves had the Cintiq Companion, Sony with their Vaio Tap, and Dell with the Venue Pros. But none of them has the ease of the fold back keyboard cover system and a solid kickstand. Sony tried, but that kickstand is akin to a picture frame's stand, just as awkward and small. The Helix suffers the additional action to either stow the keyboard attachment, or attach to ""hide"" the keyboard. Dell's keyboard periphery acted in similar to the ATIV for one of their peripherals. With the Surface Pros though, it is much like handling a book, when I get up from a desk bound work area, I simply fold back and continue (with pen and thumb keyboard - knowing I am in a text-light mode) and plop the device back down either on my lap or fold back out the keyboard for text-heavy input or traditional cursor-drag/touch/keyboard work.  I don't think Microsoft would discontinue the Surface, Surface Line, or Surface brand. They originally set out to be an example and in previous news reports of years back, it may have been said that Microsoft intended not to stay long in the devices area, giving OEMs a foundation of an example to follow, much like ATI/AMD with reference cards but now most of the video cards are on third parties.   No, Microsoft decided to solidify and reinforce the little niche of devices. They just made too good of an example as what a mobile PC should be, one that no other OEM has ever built something even close, that I can call or really now call my Personal Computer, one that I can take with me for work or play, one that is more enabling than robotphones or fruitphones, or robotpads or fruitpads ever can be that mobile industries wanted to push before Microsoft re-injected the tablet PC market. A tablet PC market that started with resistive touch screens with XP (that Jobs had fond hatred of), went almost absent with Vista, tried to remerge with 7, and then fully tried to Surface with 8 and 8.1.  I would like another EMR Wacom Pen device though, because I liked the battery-less operation and the smoothness that Wacom has. Shame that they are not as large of an OEM in the PC area so their sourcing of components or form factor isn't up to par. Hell, they do not even have a keyboard cover system or kickstand. Their Cintiq Companion 2 though is at least a bit on parity with the current mobile Core-U lines of the Surface Pro 3s. The Companions unique feature though, is the familiar ring menu and side bezel buttons like the Intuos and Cintiq monitors. And their pens also support barrel twist and pen tilt recognition, something that none of the Wacom Penabled Tablet PCs had ever, nor the N-Trig stuff.  Also, the problem with Livescribe and other PC-less pens that sync data, is well, they need to sync data. It is double the work on paper and to the PC. The problem with capacitive styluses is no palm blocking measures, meaning it is more like Japanese calligraphy and you can't rest your hand on the paper, and they are of range of thick to not so thick. I tried such stylus with a Kindle Fire and Evernote.... bad idea. So much lag. So much limitations compared to OneNote. (bias time: fuck Android, fuck Apple)"
Surface,3chmt0,Renigami,2,Wed Jul 8 07:02:20 2015 UTC,"Have you used a livescribe pen before? I have learning disabilities and I've found some management strategies that work well but require pen and paper to use. I thought the sp1 would help, but it has a lot of drawbacks compared to real paper."
Surface,3chmt0,DonCasper,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:46:55 2015 UTC,"With pen and paper, you can't edit, on the fly, cleanly, with such pens. I also arrange pictures, draw and erase, and move my text around. I cannot do this with a traditional paper and pen. I cannot copy and paste various bits of information.  Those are the drawbacks versus traditional media. I would go as far to say I like drawing on the Surface Pros, versus drawing in a sketchbook with Prismacolors, because of the advantage of layers in paint and drawing programs, Ctrl+Z, copy and paste and masks, and no eraser marks and clean erasures of lines and areas.  With pen and paper, I just do not have them. With my Surface Pro 2, I have ""infinite"" paper area and paper stack to move about in."
Surface,3chmt0,Renigami,2,Wed Jul 8 18:21:03 2015 UTC,Interesting question. I can't say I've seen anything that really compares; but I haven't really been looking since I found the Surface.  I had a Lenovo Helix a couple of years ago. It was one of the first Windows 8 pen tablets on the market. It had a pen but the writing experience wasn't anything like as compelling as the Surface.

Surface,3chmt0,tycho5ive,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"The problem I see with the jagged line issue, is that this depends on the ""resolution"" of the ""gridded"" lines that are embedded in the Surface Pro 3 and Surface 3's screens, that can be seen under a certain angled light.  They are arranged in a grid like fashion, receiving the tiny signal of the battery powered pen. Those grids interpolate the curves assigned to the grid position and possibly may not do too well in doing so for such curves and lines - hence why I typed before that I liked the smoothness of the Wacom Penabled Tablet PCs.  This would require either a finer grid array, or a more robust interpolation driver set. I don't think boosting the tiny signal output of the pen would help, this is dependent on the screen itself."
Surface,3chmt0,Renigami,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"They miss the point a bit.

The one thing I would change about it, if I could, is the fact that the pointer moves when you lift the mouse up off the surface because of the way the laser works. I'm not sure if this applies to later models. If you're on a particularly not-smooth train or using it on a very uneven surface this can make the pointer go crazy and  be a bit annoying.

Surface,3cktww,OSHWjunkie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:14:59 2015 UTC,have you read the usb battery charging specification?
Surface,3cktww,jape13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going through the spec now. The surface ""should"" be able to use a Dedicated Charging Port (DCP) where the D+ and D- lines are shorted together. This is done when the charger is not capable of enumeration. However, I still get the notification that it's not charging.   I sacrificed a USB cable and probed across the pins on the supplied charger. My meter is reporting that there is 100Ohm resistance between the data pairs and an open circuit between each data line and VBus and Gnd.  After looking through the Microsoft Answers article linked by u/AngrySpock below, one of the potential causes is that the charger can not supply enough current. Checking the charger it's capable of supplying 5.2V at 2.5A.  The current limit on my power supply I'm using to test was set at 1.2A. Turning it up to 2.5 and then connecting it to surface seems to have solved my issue.  Specification that I found: http://kinetis.pl/sites/default/files/BC1.2_FINAL.pdf"
Surface,3cktww,arcfuse3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that there is any special requirement (i.e. shorting a pins, etc.) to charging the S3.  The S3 just requires a lot of current.  The original MS power adapter supplies 5.2V @ 2.5A (13W).  The one you are trying to use is only supplying 0.6A at best.  The cable you are using will also factor into how efficiently the power is transferred to the S3.  Thin, cheap cables will not deliver enough current even if you are using an appropriate adapter.  If you want to use an alternative USB charger, find one that delivers at least 5V @ 2.1A or more, and a USB cable that is rated for quick charging (as they tend to use thicker gauge wires for the power lines in the cable)."
Surface,3cktww,IvanLasston,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:08:20 2015 UTC,There is a cable dependency and charging dependency - but as far as I can tell there is no special wiring.  Are you using the Cable supplied with the Surface 3 - with your new charger?  That cable tends to work best for testing if a power supply will charge the Surface 3.    That being said - I have tried several high power iPad chargers and they seem to work.  (5V 2A = 10W).  I don't think a 3W will charge the Surface 3 while in use.  That would be (5V .6A).  It would probably charge it slowly while asleep or off.

Surface,3ckkk3,ninjaciego,2,Wed Jul 8 17:10:54 2015 UTC,"IMHO, I'd wait for three more weeks.  Windows 10 is going to launch three more weeks and hopefully you'll know more about the Surface Pro 4 by then.  I'm also saying this because you have a nice Dell now.  The Surface Pro 4 supposed to have Skylake processor in it.  Right now rumor on the street is there'll be a SKU# with a Intel Iris 540 with 64MB of eDRAM in it.  Which for a gamer would allow you to play older AAA Titles on a tablet.  Also even wilder & crazy rumor that the Surface Pro 4 might support external GPU's VIA Skylake and Thunderbolt 3.   Again my 2 cent's because you already own a nice tablet, waiting 3-4 weeks to see what happens with Windows 10 launch isn't going to hurt you.  Here are a  couple youtube vids talking Iris Pro.  Keep in mind these are in higher TDP chips, so it's still early to tell if or what the performace will be like in the Surface Pro 4.  Iris Pro 5200 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV8Msa-Pxl8  Iris Pro 6200 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-EhyqXqLao  Iris Pro 7200 will be the Iris 540 or there a bout with an even faster new Pro with Skylake."

Answer:  When you buy your Surface Pro3, do me a favor, and take a close look at the ""power connector""  One simple solution for the ""security risk""...   Allow it to be disabled in the bios, this would solve the problem for enterprise users.  Also Thunderbolt 3.0 officially supports external GPUs.   So I think it's possible unless you have inside information, I'd never say never on something that looks like it might become a pc standard."
Surface,3ckkk3,Detroit_Alchy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:57:51 2015 UTC,"to be honest, I base my statement entirely on this: TB was originally Apple tech, continues to be an Apple ecosystem standard and is primarily associated with Apple.   I believe that MS does not want to benefit Apple, and by adopting TB they would be doing exactly that.   the SP's are what MS wants the OEM's to aspire to, according to MS. Including TB would be a signal to the rest of the industry, and I do not think that MS is going to send a signal essentially endorsing an Apple product. I know it is technically owned by Intel now, but really.  I would love an external GPU, but i honestly do not see that being more than a niche market until USB 3.1 is fully embraced.  Side note, i was shopping for an external portable drive the other day. A third party 1TB Thunderbolt capable drive cost over $200, for the 2TB model it cost $100 more. Meanwhile, a USB 3.0 2TB drive cost less than $100. i know they are not the same level of performance, but I'm thinking most of that cost premium was the 'ol ""Mac Tax"". I had a point to this last bit but now the the coffee is here so...bzzzzzt the train has reset.  as for Broadwell, I think you are right about 2013 and I suspect the SP3 was initially sketched out with Broadwell in mind.    It is amazing how Intel has struggled with the new process. I do not remember them slipping so badly before, that 14nm must be some tricky tech."
Surface,3ckkk3,ratshack,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, I appreciate it.

Since I have an external drive for videos and an SD card already it was a no brainer to get the more powerful device for the same money.

Odd issues with the USB. I completely buggered my S3 a while back by installing a build which was manifestly not ready for a touch screen.

(asks me for language and keyboard layout) which is the same thing it was doing with the borked win10 installation. I'm at a total loss for words.   EDIT _ so for science, I put it the windows 10 installtion USB stick and it booted just fine. It's just having an issue with the recovery sticks for some reason."
Surface,3cm98y,DaveFalcon73,2,Thu Jul 9 03:42:18 2015 UTC,Release version is coming out in 3 weeks.  Just wait.
Surface,3cm98y,DaveFalcon73,3,Thu Jul 9 01:35:00 2015 UTC,I'm seriously getting annoyed by all those windows 10 posts. But this one is one of the worst.  All these people who can't even install an operating system are trying windows 10 and then posting on this reddit when something goes wrong. And the endless abuse of customer service (when there is nothing wrong with the hardware). Most dont even have a clue how a computer work but are still installing the previews. So annoying...

Surface,3ckcac,ifuckedurmomtwice,3,Wed Jul 8 16:11:47 2015 UTC,All of your accessories will work with the pro 2. The pro 3 uses different pens and docking stations. Just find a cheap pro 2 and try to sell your pro 1 on ebay for parts.
Surface,3ckcac,ang3l12,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"The pen won't work with the Pro 3 or the 3. I don't believe the charging cable will work with the Pro 3, and it definitely won't work with the 3. The dock won't work with the Pro 3 or the 3.  The keyboard will work with the Pro 3 and the 3, although it'll look weird (wrong size).  If what you were doing was taxing your Pro 1, then a Pro 3 is likely what you want. The 3 is slower than the Pro 1 by a good degree.  I'd probably just sell everything on eBay and start fresh."

Surface,3ck8ta,skizztle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:36:01 2015 UTC,that sounds like it may be throttling to save power. Have you tried different power modes (e.g. high performance)? drill into the settings and poke around.
Surface,3clnaq,mgmtm3,2,Wed Jul 8 21:37:29 2015 UTC,"Tried iPad? iPads now are capable of handling this without issue. Can identify accidental touches from normal ones. I totally agree that bezel is one of the top improvement-in-need areas of the next generation of surface pro, but the form factor could be barely updated due to the announcement on accesorries made last year.   Hopefully they will do something for Surface Pro 5. That might be the thing you'll find thinner bezel."
Surface,3clnaq,lonaysta,0,Wed Jul 8 22:05:40 2015 UTC,"Nope, I just have my Surface Pro 2.  Haven't tried the iPad quite a while.  With the iPad it might be easier to achieve that with iOS over Win10.  Win10 has quite a lot of stuff off to the edges that would fall right under your grip.  Such as the start button in the lower left, and the clock on the lower right.  Also when hitting the start button in tablet mode many of the icons show up on the far left edge of the screen (all apps, power).  With iOS most everything is bunched together in a grid that hovers in the middle of the screen.  If Win10 is going to look how it does now in Preview it would require a lot of moving hands around to properly click stuff on a near bezel free design."
Surface,3clnaq,lonaysta,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:13:06 2015 UTC,"Nono, you don't get the point. iPad has a tech on the touchscreen that solves the bezel issue you mentioned without adding a ""digital bezel"". I'm not commenting anything regarding iOS vs win10 or other iOS issues, but simply the bezel thing.  You could go to any store and try browsing a webpage when holding the iPad with half of your palm covering the touchscreen. Though the ""bezel"" area is consistently touched, no touch input will be sent to the device."
Surface,3clnaq,DogeMichael,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"Hm, not sure. The bezel on SP1 is way too big, but they fixed that on SP3. I think the design works a lot better with a little blank space around the edges. It would be interesting if they took out a little of the width of the device while keeping the screen the same size, like with an iPad Mini. Are they using all that space for the touch pad?"
Surface,3clnaq,ptrkhh,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:08:59 2015 UTC,I still find the bezel on the SP3 to give the device a dated look when sitting next to something like a dell XPS.  With how small these devices are I think it would be a great way to max possible screen size while keeping it tablet+ sized.
Surface,3cii30,Puppiestho,10,Wed Jul 8 04:17:59 2015 UTC,"I bought an SP3 a week ago with the Type Cover and I would say it is definitely worth it. It protects the screen, it's the perfect size, it connects physically excellently, it has no batteries to recharge and its specifically made for the Surface. The Surface / Windows 8 goes into desktop mode when connected and if folded behind the screen it knows to go into tablet mode even though it is still connected.  Of course if you are doing any lengthy typing, then I would plug in a proper keyboard but for on the go you can't beat the Type Cover."
Surface,3cii30,gabbatron44,5,Wed Jul 8 04:48:45 2015 UTC,"I had SP1 and now use SP3 - both with type covers. The one for SP3 is really really worth it - keys and trackpad are big and easy to use. I use it exclusively (without external keyboard) for many months now, and typing experience is great."
Surface,3cii30,kpetrovsky,2,Wed Jul 8 07:36:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. Type Cover is essential accessory for every work meeting use for me. But I prefer a proper full-sized keyboard when docked.
Surface,3cii30,MoralRelativity,3,Wed Jul 8 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"It's very convenient. You get a keyboard and a cover that plugs into the proprietary slot on the bottom of the keyboard. Can you get a more protective cover and a better keyboard/touchpad for less money? Absolutely. Are the savings worth the added bulk and hassle to set up? That's your call.   When I bought the type cover it was worth it since it was all I used. These days I'll take my mechanical keyboard and num pad with me so the type cover gets less use unless I just need to quickly look something up. Would I buy the type cover now? I'm not sure, but I'm leaning towards no."
Surface,3cii30,Rashkh,2,Wed Jul 8 08:12:29 2015 UTC,"Im speaking for the surface pro 1 but to me it's worth it, up till now I was using a 60% mech keyboard that worked amazing especially for photoshop. The only thing is that the type cover makes it so convenient to carry everything in a simple package. I debated picking up a bluetooth keyboard as well because the placement of the type cover can be awkward when using photoshop short cuts, and for $13 on amazon you cant go wrong for the price. In all honesty the big selling point to me was the sleek look even though I did give up a bit of convenience if I had gone with a cheap bluetooth keyboard but I am happy with my decision and would do it again. Another selling point is when I'm being lazy in bed I have a full keyboard ready on my lap if I need it and dont have to hunt down my keyboard and mess with placement. Just a few key things that I thought about when making my purchase."
Surface,3cii30,AlexBeEasy,2,Wed Jul 8 04:28:40 2015 UTC,"I have one for the SP2 and damn, it makes a tone of sense. Far too expensive, IMO though. It came with my used SP2.  If your BT keyboard is cheap and easy to carry with the surface then you could be fine. The fact that the type cover attaches to the device and has a touchpad are pretty handy features."
Surface,3cii30,ididntgotoharvard,2,Wed Jul 8 04:44:49 2015 UTC,"I would get a different keyboard, they type cover has a bunch of issues. I can never seem to use the arrow keys properly because they're different sizes. The function keys keep screwing up. The touchpad surface extends to the right and left click buttons, so I end up moving the mouse almost every time I want to click (or especially right click) on something."
Surface,3cii30,below_the_surface,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"If you're not going to attempt to use it on your lap, a seperate keyboard is going to be nicer typing option.   The Type Cover is okayish for a laptop keyboard (not as good as Macbook Air/Pro, Thinkpads), but bad in comparision to the better bluetooth keyboards or a 60% mech. Further the Type Cover touchpad is utter trash. Any mouse or external touchpad is better.   You can probably pick up options you'd like more for less money, but you'd lose a little portability."

What that means is when you log into your account in OneNote (or w/e office program) on another device, your quick access settings show up.

Below is what I wanted to post in details:  I had surface pro before and can't recall having this problem until it was replaced by (likely used, there were scratches) surface pro 1.  When a USB is connected, if I move it back and forth, it disconnects and reconnects. If I push it back and hold, it remains disconnected. Though with USB drives it is not annoying, but as I use USB hard drive, if I move the hard drive and the USB cable moves slightly, it disconnects and reconnects. It can damage the data. Another problem I've been having is, as I stream xbox one to surface pro, if I move my controller enough that causes the cable to put pressure on the USB cable to push, it disconnects and reconnects. Then I've to disconnect controller fully and then plug again for it to work. Kind of annoying when this happens during a battle.  By USB I mean the thing that is attached inside the surface pro. I have tried different USB cables. It seems the inside part of the USB thing in surface pro isn't firm. Oh and not pushing hard."

Surface,3ch204,IvanLasston,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:44:58 2015 UTC,"Can you plug anything else into the HDMI port to rule out the display being the issue?  Do you have or have access to a monitor with a different input? If the SP3 can't output through a different connector, it's probably the SP3; if it can, it's likely the connector. A local computer shop might be willing to let you hook up to one of their displays for a quick test.  It'll be easier to lean on support if you're able to rule any possibilities out. Otherwise I'd be inclined to lean on the MS store to have the adapter replaced. Cords tend to fail more frequently than ports and PCs."
Surface,3cj5w8,mfanovice,2,Wed Jul 8 09:13:56 2015 UTC,"The monitor should work.  The problem is cabling.  The Surface Pro 3 has a mini displayport as an output for video.  If you order everything from Dell - you'd need the Dell mini displayport adapter €9.09, as well as the displayport cable €22.69.  It should work - but my company standardized on Dell and we have Dell adapters in use with Dells - not everyone is happy with them but they have worked for me for the most part - using a Mac.  I don't have any experience using Dell mini displayport adapters with a Surface Pro 3.  Monoprice has the cables for cheaper but I don't know what the prices/shipping look like to Europe.  I use a Monoprice cable and monitor with a Surface 3 and that works fine. http://www.monoprice.com/Category?c_id=102&cp_id=10246&cs_id=1024606  Also - I noticed that the USB hub in this monitor is USB 2.0 - Just something to note if you are planning to use it as a USB hub - you won't get the advantage of the USB 3.0 of the SP3 - but if your peripherals are all USB 2.0 this may not matter."

Surface,3cj5w8,IvanLasston,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:13:08 2015 UTC,That monitor has a lower resolution.  1080p monitors are a dime a dozen now a days.  That monitor would work as well but you would still need a cable or adapter that has mini displayport - to HDMI or DVI.    It just depends on what you want to do.  I tend to go higher resolution on my monitors because most video is 1080p - which means if you do any editing - the external monitor will be fully taken up by the video if you have a 1080p monitor.  If that isn't a concern then most 1080p monitors are fine.

Surface,3cgqr7,chaski,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:41:22 2015 UTC,"Can the Start Screen be as the same as it was with 8.1? Will ""All Apps"" be as claustrophobic in browsing and folder reveal? This is what I had issues with when I played with 10 several builds back. The Charms settings ease of access is also what I liked but not seen in 10. Tablet mode is just having each window being maximized. I missed the screen edge swipes to get the full ""modern"" taskbar with the Desktop pane there to switch to and snapping of the various apps by drag and dock.  And Modern IE (or edge or whatever re-brand they had to do, because society is hard stuck on Google, stupid consumers) is absent on 10...  I am a bit hesitant, my Pro 2 is my main mobile powerhouse. I rather not interrupt it."

Surface,3chrox,ratshack,3,Wed Jul 8 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"First I have an anecdote for you because I think my dad would have been the same way. My dad's idea when I was in undergrad was to get me a ~$500 laptop, see how long it lasted, then get another one when the first one breaks. It's kind of a nice idea in theory... new warranty, new parts (but at that price point the parts are sometimes awful anyway). My first laptop (low end Toshiba) was too slow after 1 year when I switched majors and needed to use different software. The second laptop (low end Acer) needed warranty service JUST BEFORE its warranty expired in a year, then died AGAIN about a year later out of warranty. Spent probably over $1200 on those two laptops together and had to do a complete system swap each time a computer died, was replaced, was sent in, and was returned from service... each time in the middle of semesters while also trying to get work done. To its credit, the first laptop (Toshiba) actually still works (slowly), 9 years later... but as the Acer shows, it's a bit of a crapshoot when you go and buy an inexpensive laptop. Senior year as a sort of graduation gift to myself (and because my laptop had died), I built my own custom high-end desktop computer and that's been pretty good to me. Repairs are trivial on a desktop so I don't worry about having to uproot my whole life if anything there breaks. In my first year of grad school, still sort of following my dad's old idea, I bought a ~$700 (HP this time) laptop and it has lasted me almost 4 years now, but it's starting to give me warnings when it boots about parts failing, which is why I've moved on to my SP3. My SP3 is the most expensive computer I've owned (though it's similar to the desktop machine), but as you are already aware it's an awesome device. I would love for it to last several years, but I guess time will tell.  Here's what I think is more important than anything else: What are you studying? If it's anything where your computer really matters, where you have to use it basically all day every day to get work done (engineering, computer science, architecture, maybe some other stuff), then it's definitely worth spending big bucks on it. If it's as important to you as a vehicle, a pile of text books, a month of living expenses, etc.... then don't be afraid to spend that much money on it. Divide the cost over its lifetime... are you willing to pay $1 or $2 per day to have a nice computer? I realize that's a good way to justify a lot of bad expenses, but IMO it's appropriate for a tool crucial to your life like my computer is to mine."
Surface,3chrox,foxox,3,Wed Jul 8 02:17:30 2015 UTC,Return it and get an S3 for half the price????
Surface,3chrox,plus1zero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:08:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe look for an SP2?  You may save some money, and I find that the SP2 works with even the small college classroom desks, and even most teaching theatre desks.   The SP3 would have issues with the distance between the back of the kickstand and the front of the type cover being large enough that is uncomfortable to type and keep the screen at a good angle for the pen.   For classes with tables it's a non-issue, but for small desks the kickstand can be a problem. It definitely takes up more desk space than a clamshell design.   Also, if you don't need the pen, the Surface may not be the best thing for you. OneNote works on other laptops, though the pen really makes OneNote shine. I think that's especially true with the SP2, as it uses Wacom pens with an eraser end. I can't imagine using one without an eraser now.   The ink to math function of the pen and OneNote is simply amazing.   Also, OneNote 2013 (desktop) is what you should use. The Metro app is severely limited in functionality in comparison."
Surface,3chrox,chiliedogg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:00:53 2015 UTC,"you could only ""save"" so much money going downmarket with cheaper laptops. Anything decent you will end up saving a couple hundred at best, and then you will be cutting corners that will make the money you did spend feel wasted.   As long as the power is not getting turned off next week or something...keep it.   EDIT: get it listed on Dads homeowners insurance policy so if it gets broken or stolen you are not assed out. Also to avoid him getting to laugh at you."
Surface,3chrox,ratshack,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:20:08 2015 UTC,"Haha, holy shit. Me and you literally have the exact same story. Here's the deal. I bought an i5 128 SP3 and typecover thinking it would be the perfect thing for school and that jazz. Here's the thing. There are a lot of people who use all the cool note taking features and pens and stuff. But most people I know that use a surface basically use it as a really thin laptop.   So here's what you need to think about to make your decision. If you are thinking of using this as a fancy laptop and won't really use all the drawing features then get something else. I personally have terrible handwriting that I can barely read on paper on the best of days and writing on the SP3 screen is just an effort in futility for me.   Now, about an hour ago, I sold my SP3 on craigslist and picked up a Surface 3 and love the smaller screen. I ended up using my SP3 as a youtube/reddit/Microsoft word machine and I just felt kinda bummed with my purchase. The surface 3 fits my needs much better, but I currently have it trying to restore as I completely fucked it up trying to install the 10162 preview build.   Anyway. in conclusion, if you don't think you will take advantage of the various niche luxuries the sp3 offers (Super high res screen, pen input, etc) then you would be doing yourself a favor by returning it and getting a better suited 700 laptop. ESPECIALLY if you want it to last 4 years.   That being said, the SP3 is also a fantastic device and you would probably enjoy it anyway."

Surface,3cf6pp,AlinaCroft,2,Tue Jul 7 13:09:31 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't a case prevent me from using the kickstand though?

Yes almost all cases will prevent you from accessing the built in kickstand and thus usually substitute them with their own terrible one.

Surface,3cf6pp,av0w,2,Wed Jul 8 07:12:18 2015 UTC,"I've heard that it smells bad? Is that true?  Does it add a lot of weight? And since it doesn't hold the Surface itself, are you ever afraid of it falling off? Finally, is there anything you don't like about it?"
Surface,3cf6pp,ratshack,2,Wed Jul 8 13:06:56 2015 UTC,"no unusual smells that I was aware of.   It adds weight but not so i really notice, the added thickness and grip seem to balance that out somehow.   It has an eleastic strap that you pull over when closed, I do not worry about it slipping out. Heck, i dropped it down a short flight of stairs where it cartwheeled down. When i opened it the SP3 had dislodged from the TC but had otherwise not moved hardly at all and there was zero device damage. Woulda been wrecked without the case for sure.   I find the flap that hold the TC retaining clip to be odd and slightly unwieldy. My retention clip required a pry tool to release when I first got it but it has mellowed out since then without an apparent loss of integrity. I mostly leave the TC in there anyway.  The light grey inside got marked up a bit from deploying the kickstand when in the case, not much i can think of to avoid that. The pen loop stretched out loose pretty quickly. I ended up with 2 MS loops that I wasn't otherwise using so i stuck them on in series and now have like a pen sleeve that works pretty well. (same position, just added them in a line).   It really is a pretty good design overall considering the unusual nature of the SP3.   Most of the cases i find just ignore the excellent kickstand and/or try to substitute there own solution which does not seem to me the way to go.   There may be a better solution but I have not yet found it, certainly not if you want to preserve dockability and/or just hold it naked once in awhile.   /holy crap did i write all that gettowork.jpg"

Surface,3cf6pp,3DXYZ,3,Tue Jul 7 13:56:00 2015 UTC,"I just don't use one. You can clip the pen to the skinnier hinge area of the Type Cover when it's closed, just like clipping a normal pen to a notebook. If you fold the cover around backwards while the pen is clipped there (without reversing how it's clipped) it can make the pen and the back of the Surface rub on each other, but I don't care and could reverse the pen, like I said, if I did care."

I've seen demo pens at BestBuy/MS Store with the rubber material worn off. I wonder if you could affix a soft material (like used on the loops) to the hinge area of the cover to make a little pocket for the clip to go into and keep a layer of fabric between that and the screen. I may try this if the rubber ever wears away from my pen clip."

Surface,3cf6pp,padgo,2,Tue Jul 7 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"Pro tip - don't put it on the front edge of the keyboard. When you're not using the pen and its in the loop, have fun typing.

Surface,3cf6pp,nocorvair,2,Tue Jul 7 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"I barely use my pen loop, to be completely honest.  I had troubles with it refusing to stick to the type cover itself, so I stuck it to the surface itself, near the volume buttons.

I have always loved the idea of digital notes and my iPad Air 2 + stylus still didn't cut it so I sold it. I fell in love with S3/SP3 stylus in store, but figured I'd wait until SP4 assuming a July 29 launch. The wait and the lack of something to work with day to day is killing me.  I really just want to take digital handwritten notes, basic sketches, do some handwritten math, read PDFs, surf the web, watch twitch/youtube, run office. Having the ability to run vim/visual studio (even command line) is a bonus, but not an activity I'd expect to do often (I have a workstation for that). I think the i3 SP3 is the perfect match other than the 64GB disk, but I think I can live with that constraint by keeping all my PDFs on a microSD... Maybe the 128GB/4GB S3 is a better fit..."

Surface,3cdvll,haXona,2,Tue Jul 7 11:36:47 2015 UTC,"At this point, I think Microsoft is going to wait for the Skylake U processors to come out, the first batch is rumored for September and the second is January. The processors for January are the upgraded version of the current i5 and i7 processors in the SP3 (4300U and 4650U, upgrades to 6300U and 6600U), so we may be waiting until January for the SP4.   However, I'm wondering if Microsoft wants to have the SP4 ready for the holidays and would use the U-series going out in September (Core i3-6100U / i5-6200U / i7-6500U) to do so.  But to answer your question, the desktop processors don't mean anything for the SP4"
Surface,3cdvll,mokasakin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:05:45 2015 UTC,What keeping MS from not choosing an Intel cpu in the 5000U series? They have pretty solid performance and are energy efficient
Surface,3cdvll,haXona,2,Tue Jul 7 11:01:22 2015 UTC,"Because there is no major (if any) performance jump or addition of new features with Broadwell over Haswell. If the SP4 was launched now with Broadwell, it would be dated tech within a few months."
Surface,3cdvll,ratshack,2,Wed Jul 8 00:07:40 2015 UTC,Yeah right now it would be a bad choice but when right around the Build conference there was still some time for a reasonable upgrade to Broadwell. They run a lot cooler than Haswell with better performance. Seeing as the SP3 throttles a lot that problem would have been fixed with Broadwell and bonus performance on top of it.   The wait now is going to make the SP3 look pretty low specs wise compared to other devices :/ but yeah I rather wait
Surface,3cdvll,haXona,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"really no point in confusing the market with 2 skus on for the same model, especially with such a minor improvement.   Single digits do not excite."

Surface,3cdvll,haXona,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:31:38 2015 UTC,"not really, it was the same chip just a tiny bit higher clock. The box didn't even change. I had both, it made no discernible difference whatsoever in actual performance.   For the measly performance gain that Broadwell would gain, the costs of redesign and supply chain, not to mention pissing off all current SP3 owners, just not worth it. Skylake brings some goods to the table, worth a model release."

Surface,3cc8qz,tockef,-2,Mon Jul 6 19:58:44 2015 UTC,Stock surface charger pushes 2.5a so a 2.4 wouldn't be any faster.
Surface,3cc8qz,Turbocharged-Z,2,Tue Jul 7 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"Some of my unscientific observations are: (when Surface is stable, with no app running) 1. stock charger + stock cable, the charge rate is around 6500mW 2. Mi 10000 mAh battery pack (5V 2.1A) + stock cable, rate is around 5700mW 3. Mi 10000 mAh battery pack + Nexus 7 stock cable, rate is around 4700mW 4. Apple 12W charger (2.4A) + Orico 3A cable, virtually same rate as the MS stock combo 5. A power strip comes with USB socket (rated 2A Max) + stock cable, charge around 5500mW  So, a $19 Apple 12W charger is smaller and cheaper than a MS charger, and you can get a 2.5-3A USB to MicroUSB cable online with very little cost. So, if you need a quality second charger to leave at your office or stuff in your bag, this may be a good choice."

For the spec there is no doubt you desktop is faster but in my experience the SP1 has been fast enough to deal with anything i though to throw at it. So perhaps you can draw by plugging everything into the surface and when you wan to do some heavier filters and stuf transfer to the desktop.  At this point i'm suggesting alternative ways to achieve what you wan because i don't know of anythign that will work assured. Remote desktop won't show on the desktop so i don't know of any software that work for what you wan.

Surface,3ce3aq,LouieWilfred,8,Tue Jul 7 04:54:26 2015 UTC,"What version of iOS are you on? On <8.3 you can pull all the music off your phone no problem. On 8.3-8.4 you'll need to jailbreak with Taig and install the Apple File Conduit 2 tweak from Saurik's repo.  Next, on your computer install iFunbox, the most highly regarded tool to look at the files on your device.  Open iFunbox and plug in your phone, the leftmost tab should have your phone connected, and the side menu should have a list of options, click Raw Files.  Now, navigate to User > Media > iTunes_Control > Music, you should find a ton of folders, and inside are all your music files, renamed into gibberish (e.g. H3KL, NJ7W, etc.),  but the gibberish names only effect the filename not any of the song metadata.  Drag and drop all these folders to where ever you may want on your computer. Once they upload from your iPhone pull all the songs out of their individual folders (typically bundled in sets of 20 or so) and collect them together in one folder.  Now you're done! Although I have one more step if you're picky and want to fix the file name issue.  Download a tag editing program, and set all your music files to convert the filename to match the song name. This should fix the gibberish titles. I used this one."

They must have not played many games, joined any teamfights which cost more resources, and they must not be very good at the game if they dont notice an important difference between 30/40ish and 55/60 fps . I owned a sp2 i5 and it was capable of playing league on lowest settings at between 50 and 60 fps. that is certainly playable, but I wanted a bit better.  So I bought the sp3 and was severely disappointed. When playing longer games, and specifically in teamfights (the most important time in the game) the game would be unplayable. it would go as low as 30 fps and that is unplayable for me.   Maybe if you're somewhere in gold elo you wont notice. I myself took the game pretty seriously and could not live with how bad the sp3 was at running league so I sold it. I am however thinking about buying a sp3 (or 4 when it comes out) again because I've got a real gaming computer now.  Maybe now with the firmware updates it's gotten better. And maybe the new map helps too. And maybe you could try playing it on low settings combined with low resulotion. I played on 1080p and that didnt work. Maybe you could try even lower than that."
Surface,3ccjf2,Xipotec,-2,Mon Jul 6 23:13:58 2015 UTC,How is 30 fps unplayable?  You must have never had experience with what computers used to be like.
Surface,3ccjf2,Eviljim,10,Mon Jul 6 23:39:45 2015 UTC,30fps is terrible when you're used to 60 in action intensive games. In competitive games it's unacceptable to have fps drops.

Surface,3ccjf2,formfactor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"I used to think 30 was perfectly fine, but in a quick paced game like LoL you need at least 45 fps to make the game smooth and playing it easier. To the OP if you want to play LoL get the sp3. I have a sp2 (same i5 as surface pro 3) and it works great but I also got a surface 3 and on all low its cpu is the bottleneck not the GPU. I wish I could limit the fps to 45 (only has 30 and 60) because halfway through a game the atom cpu would start to throttle down a bit and I'd go from 45-60fps to 25-30 and its really hard to make then plays like that lol. Tl;dr get the sp3 for LoL it'll be fine just don't crank everything to max and get IXTU (Intel extreme tuning utility) to undervolt and reduce thermals for less throttling.  Edit: running 1080p on my SP2 on medium settings low shadows i get about 60minimum 85max fps."

These comments are what made me believe that the sp3 could handle games when it couldn't. the guy saying it can handle league on max settings is straight up lying. league on max settings on an i3? just fuck off. you'd be lucky to get more than 10 fps in a teamfight. If that's playable to you then it's clear we're not talking about the same kind of people.  I bought an sp3 and was so dissapointed in the device because it was worse at gaming than the sp2 was.

Surface,3ca3zb,javawag,6,Mon Jul 6 08:00:57 2015 UTC,"You'd be going from an i5 to an atom, from 8G RAM to 4 (if you splurge for the better model), and from an SSD to something akin to an SD card in terms of reads/writes (SSD can perform many at the same time, S3 storage cannot).  I use a 2012 MBA for work and I also write software.  The MBA is actually a fantastic machine for this and so far I've had no complaints.    For personal use I have a 2010 MBP and it's getting a bit long in the tooth so I've been looking at new computers.  So far my list is basically narrowed to a rMBP/MBA or a Surface/Surface Pro.  I don't do tons of developing in my own time but I do often have eclipse/tomcat/mysql running (which is a lot less than I run on my MBA for work).  I considered the S3 but realized that it would basically be just a writing/browsing machine.  If my job was to write words instead of software an S3 would be fine.    If you google S3 benchmarks you'll see that the S3 compares pretty well with an iPad Air 2 in the tablet arena.  Against actual computers it's either last or tied for last place.  If you get the 4G S3 model and then add a keyboard and add a Pen it'll come out to pretty close to the base SP3 model which already comes with a pen.  The ~$150 extra to spend to get the base SP3 with a keyboard would be well worth it IMO."
Surface,3ca3zb,Mrredditorson,2,Mon Jul 6 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"Very good points. The RAM I think would be bearable and the CPU should still be okay, but maybe the storage will kill it not being an SSD.  I'll take a look at the benchmarks in that case, especially as you say it comes with the Pen so that makes the SP3 a bit more desirable!"
Surface,3ca3zb,apemanzilla,2,Mon Jul 6 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"I use a Surface 3 - 128 gb/4 gb ram model. I do web browsing, note taking, and coding on it (I write Java in Eclipse) and aside from minor (1-3 second) freezes when first starting everything up, it works fine. Coding in itself isn't usually that heavy, unless you're doing a full build of a larger project. If I were you, I would go to a Microsoft store, and try a demo one for a while (make sure you are comfortable with the type cover - it's more compact than most keyboards) and maybe buy one, and return it if it doesn't work out.  Edit: As far as storage is concerned - I've found the Surface 3's storage to reach similar speeds as a 7200 rpm hard drive - when copying files on the internal storage, I usually get 30 - 40 MB/s speeds. Not too bad, but not really ""SSD tier."""
Surface,3ca3zb,apemanzilla,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:16:11 2015 UTC,"Cool - I'm not sure which is heavier, Visual Studio or Eclipse :P! But that's good to hear - to be honest, my Air is the first laptop I've had with an SSD, and I find 7200RPM hard drives to be more than tolerable (I have the patience of a... patient thing).  I think I'll go back to the store tonight and try it out again. I have tried the keyboard, but the tables at the store are so far down it's not really a decent real life angle, if you see what I mean.   Also, we don't have MS stores in the UK :(. We have Apple, but for Microsoft stuff you have to go to PC World (!= PC World in the US). Maybe this will change now MS are really starting to push their own hardware out there?"
Surface,3ca3zb,Mrredditorson,2,Tue Jul 7 08:00:47 2015 UTC,"Visual studio is almost certainly heavier. IMO the atom processor isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be (4 cores with turbo to 2.4 GHz) and works fine in most cases.  A few tips:   Don't use Chrome - it doesn't seem to play well with the Surface from my experiences. Firefox is better, but IE is best. If you don't use IE, download the h264ify extension, which will make YouTube videos less intensive and laggy. Don't even bother with the 64 GB Surface 3. Once you start installing programs you'll be out of space in no time. One issue I have noticed is that my Surface seems to randomly freeze once in a while, forcing me to shut it down and reboot.

It has the odd slow down, and if you didn't like the MBA trackpad with Windows drivers, you'll think the tiny Surface trackpad is terrible.  It's all very usable on lap or in bed once you get used to how you have to have the kickstand/kb angled, but you'll find yourself wishing for a good sturdy laptop if you use it that way often.   I feel like even light VS C++ will be tedious (with load times, a bit of lag here and there, etc), but I'm not very patient.  The upgrade in screen quality is very nice.  Overall, I'd only do the swap if you also want a pretty decent tablet for movies, kindle, etc to go with the laptop functionality, otherwise it's a pretty big trade down overall.  I don't regret making the change, as for a light use travel computer, the tablet functionality is a real win."
Surface,3ca3zb,Nausky,5,Mon Jul 6 10:33:08 2015 UTC,If you use ThrottleStop you can prevent the slowdowns. A lot of them are caused by the processor down clocking to 800 megahertz.

I admit to not knowing much about this ThrottleStop, but I am generally skeptical about ""performance for free""; if it's preventing throttling from happening (which is a safety measure, especially on a completely passively cooled device like the Surface 3) or even if it's pegging the multiplier there are likely downsides (battery, heat, longevity, etc.)"
Surface,3ca3zb,segagamer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:54:42 2015 UTC,"Nice - pretty in-depth there, thanks!   I think the tablet functionality is a definite plus for me - I'd like to do light Photoshop tasks on-the-go too (mostly dev-graphics, if you know what I mean!). But also, being able to switch to portrait and scroll through long .cpp files and see many lines at once is a big plus (aside: I mounted my iMac at home on a VESA mount which rotates so I can use that in portrait, highly recommend that for coding!)  As for lap usage, I think I would be using it on a desk more often than on my lap, but I just wanted to know if it was at least semi-feasible to use as a laptop!  Yeah, I think you may be right about the lag though - even my Air it lags a little.   The more I think about it, the more I think I need to just get one to try it out for my own use-case!

Surface,3ca3zb,Reddit_newguy24,3,Tue Jul 7 12:21:09 2015 UTC,"UK the Surface Pro ends up around £1,000 with the pen and cover   I guess that really depends on what Surface Pro3 spec you are after. The core i5 128Gb model is approx £670 on amazon:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-Surface-i5-4300U-Win8-1-64-bit/dp/B00KHR4T8U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436172376&sr=8-1&keywords=surface+pro+3  Although it is US import - i don't think that should make much difference. (unless someone can tell different - curious)  So altogether you would be in the £820 ish area for SP3+cover+pen ...  The S3 is probably good enough for Visual Studio. For me, the bigger consideration would be the screen size. Coding on the SP3 screen will probably be easier on the eyes."

Surface,3ca3zb,Laiverbird,2,Mon Jul 6 12:26:00 2015 UTC,"I have an old 2011 MBA 11"" - i7 4G of RAM.  I ran bootcamp in the past with an older MBP, but with the limited space on the MBA I went with a virtual machine on an external drive.    I decided since my corporate standard is Windows - to get a dedicated windows device.  Pricing between a SP3 i3 and a top of the line Atom S3 in the states was pretty minimal.  The reason is - once you buy the Pen ($50 USD) and Keyboard ($130 USD) for the S3, the price came out to $780.  The i3 already comes with a Pen and the SP3 keyboard is usually around $110.  So that makes it $810 (there are discounts going on in the States on the i3.)  You get a Core processor instead of the Atom and you get a better screen for about $100 more, but you loose 64GB in disk space as the i3 only comes with a 64GB drive.  This can be made up with an external SDHC card, to help alleviate the smaller sized drive.  That being said one of our club stores, Costco, had a bundle deal for $700 for the pen/keyboard/S3 - so I went with that.  Some places say that the S3 is about 80% of the Pro 3 http://www.tabletpcreview.com/feature/microsoft-surface-pro-3-vs-microsoft-surface-3/2/  I have been playing Dawn of War on the S3 at lower resolution (1024x768) with no problems.  Haven't tried to kick it up.  This is a Pentium 3/4 era game.  I can play for a couple of hours and still be at ~50% battery.  Someone earlier asked about Hearthstone - and I loaded that and it played fine on the S3.  I too was worried about using it on the lap.  To be honest the kickstand isn't all that bad.  There are several cases that act as stands if you want something more substantial on the lap.  (Don't know if a US amazon link will work) http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-SPARIN®-Leather-Display/dp/B00VI1URGC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1436200094&sr=8-2&keywords=surface+3+case+-pro But I actually went with an Incipio case that seems to work OK on the lap - you can fold it over.  But it is very easy to pull the S3 out and use it as a tablet as it uses the keyboard as the connection mechanism. http://www.incipio.com/cases/tablet-cases/microsoft-surface-cases-sleeves/microsoft-surface-3-cases-covers/roosevelt-slim-folio-microsoft-surface-3.html  As a tablet - you kind of need a pointing device.  I tend to have the pen near by when I don't have the keyboard/trackpad attached.    I also agree with the statement - the trackpad on the keyboard isn't all that great.  It is usable but it seems to be really setup to be used as a touchscreen.  Most of the gestures that I am used to on the OS X side aren't there in many of the programs on the Windows side.  (Back/Forward swiping is the big one for me.  Only works in some apps with the trackpad, does work with the touchscreen)  That being said, the touchscreen and Pen are much better/more reactive than anything else I've used.  Don't get it for the trackpad - get it for the touchscren/Pen.    I'd be a little concerned if you are trying to do compiles on this machine.  Probably OK for editing but anything that hits the CPU hard will probably be disappointing.  But as a secondary computer and accessing MS Office, and the like it does just fine.    Bottom line - I wanted a Pen/touchsceen solution.  I am also using it with VPN to access my corporate network.  I use it because my corporate standard is Google Drive, and MS Office on the iPad can only get to OneDrive (Yes you can get to Google drive but it is a pain and isn't as straight forward as using a full up Windows 8.1)  The size/weight is significant over an iPad Mini which is what I am using as my consumption device.  Even an iPad Air 2 is lighter, feels better for longer periods of use as a tablet/consumption device.  622g - 1.37lbs, vs 437g - .96lbs is a pretty big difference - and the iPad Air 2 has a better tablet screen than the S3.  The battery life isn't as good as an iPad so I find myself worrying about charging it - whereas an iPad seems to last forever.  If you are a Windows guy - then maybe this is a better solution than a Mac running windows.  I am a Mac guy trying to fit into a corporate standard.  I may go get a MBP 13"" - with a 1TB hard drive and go back to Virtual Machines/bootcamp.  I'm not convinced carrying this 3rd device gets me anything over a MBP plus an iPad for my use case.  Since you use a MBA as a Windows device - this is probably a better solution as a secondary/portable device than an MBA - but you'll probably want to spend the Money to go Pro to match the MBA performance."

Yeah, all very good points. I actually didn't realise the pen came with the Pro, but that obviously alleviates some of the pain of the higher price. To be honest, a Core anything will likely be better than Atom for compiling stuff - although really the stuff I compile isn't majorly taxing, so it might be ""good enough"".   The pointing device thing - I actually noticed that in store. While I don't have the fattest fingers, I had a little trouble with the touchscreen in ""Desktop"" mode. ""Modern"" apps were obviously very usable though. Hopefully this will change a little in Windows 10 but with the Pen it was very usable.

Then S3 is a wonderful product.  I was planning to use the S3 as a secondary device, but to my surprise it is quite capable for my daily activitties (MS Office, more often reviewing/editing files than creating new ones, Surfing the web, watch some video online and from downloaded local files). So my primary device, the rMBP has been left on the shelf much more often than I thought it would. If I need to edit large number of RAW pictures from my DSLR or when I need to edit videos, I still use the Macbook or my Dell desktop computer. For everything else, S3 got them covered nicely. If you plan to use your S3 in laptop mode in more than 50% of the time, I'd suggest you go for the SP3 or wait a bit for the SP4/discounted SP3.

While I love the fact the kb is lit, I think if I were doing a lot of work on the pc, I would plug it into a dock and go mouse and kb along with touch.  The pend is really great.  I didn't think I would like it so much.  For one note to keep organized with ideas it is wonderful.  I wish I were more artistic, but even with my limited ability, I get use out of it for those purposes.  It is fast, and I haven't yet experienced the slowdown some others have experienced.  I went with the i5 256gb, as I wanted to put games on it.  Even without the games, I think I would have gone the 256 version, as at the time it had more ram as well.    I am in a similar situation, I have a desktop that I pimped out years ago, that still is able to do everything I need, but I needed something portable.  You know what?

EDIT: You didn't mention power, but either make sure your seat has a power outlet available, or pick up an external battery pack if you don't have one.

(The only things I am concerned about are the transition to N-Trig from Wacom, and the lower speed CPU)  I've also got two monitors running with the SP screen disabled (cant stand having a screen below the others.  Eventually I will rig the SP3 to be inline and on a strong arm so that I can draw with ease. Good luck with your decision, I personally think the SP line is crazy strong and worth every penny.  I have never been disappointed yet."
Surface,3caxph,Snozaz,2,Wed Jul 8 13:20:58 2015 UTC,"Fellow mech eng here. I'm thinking of getting a SP3 to go along side a desktop.  I think the SP3 should be able to run Solidworks, MatLab, Mathematica... The main problem will be what size projects you'll be running. I was starting school 7 years ago and my bog standard MacBook ran Solidworks admirably well. Obviously it would start stuttering on larger assemblies but it was certainly usable for basic projects. The processor in the SP3 benchmarks 3 to 4 times higher than that machine. The SP3 also outperforms my 2011 15"" MacBook Pro when it comes to single threaded applications - which a lot of engineering software is (solidworks rebuilds parts/assemblies on a single core). That machine had no problem handling even fairly large assemblies. I find that when it comes to programs like MatLab, it depends so much on what you're trying to solve. For me it's always been near instantaneous or have a snack while waiting on results kind of situation.   For CAD, you could benefit from the better GPU in the i7 version which doesn't seem to get a lot of love here as it throttles when gaming. I'm hoping it'll handle the odd TF2 LAN though.  If you want a better idea of what the machine is capable of, you might get better results by searching for what the MacBook Air can do as it's a very similar computer.  I really think the i5 should get the job done, that's the one I'm eyeing as well. The Microsoft Surface engineering team has a promo video where they show that they actually the engineering work on SP3s for what it's worth. If you're still in school and have access to a powerful desktop, I'm sure you'll be fine!"
Surface,3caxph,Kronusx12,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:01:56 2015 UTC,Multisim and 2d autocad run fine on my  i3 2370M/4gb thinkpad using intel graphics. I'm not sure how much more demanding your software is in comparison.
Surface,3caxph,FSUenginerd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have had with any of those is Solidworks actually. Sometimes when building large assemblies or having multiple drawings open I get memory warnings and it drags to a halt. If I had it to do all over again, I would get the i5 8gb version, 4 just isn't quite enough."
Surface,3ccjka,Michael1521,2,Mon Jul 6 21:14:02 2015 UTC,I think it's an option only if the refurb is purchased direct from MS. Might want to verify with MS support about that.
Surface,3ccjka,minipolliwog,2,Tue Jul 7 03:45:54 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for ebay, but I was able to get complete on the manufacturer refurbished SP3 that I bought from Amazon. I just took it to a Microsoft store, explained that it was a refurb from Amazon and asked if there was any way to get complete on it, and they hooked me up after checking it over.   I can't promise that you'll have the same luck, but the people at the MS store were extremely helpful. They could've probably hid behind the fine print and denied complete for my Surface, but instead they didn't even bother trying to fight it since it passed their inspection. YMMV of course, but it's definitely possible."
Surface,3ccjhk,iRedditWithMyOwnEyes,3,Mon Jul 6 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"Just know that the Surface 3 is fanless.  There is nothing in it to make noise.  Plus all things being equal the i3 has only 37GB usable space vs 93GB on the top of the line Surface 3 or 97GB on the lower level i5. https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/storage  I believe you are referring to the slowdown due to heat issue with the SP3? http://tabtec.com/windows/surface-pro-3-intel-core-i3-vs-core-i5-performance-battery-life/  Another thing to note about the Surface 3 - it uses micro-usb for charging.  I am able to use a tablet external battery to charge it.  I picked up a really big battery 22,400 mah - that I've used to charge on the go.  I need to do more testing to get numbers but right now I am able to charge with anything that will charge an iPad.  2.1-2.4A and 5V seems to be enough to charge  the Surface 3 - whereas the SP3 needs a proprietary magnetic cable and charger.  So - if you are still on with the Pro - I would say the i3 is probably what you want for what you mentioned - because you can still add an external SD card to help with the space issue."
Surface,3ccjhk,IvanLasston,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:10:40 2015 UTC,The Surface 3 is fanless?? I did not know that. Is this beneficial? It must make it much quieter.  Would you recommend I give the S3 another look or as you said the SP3 is the way to go?
Surface,3ccjhk,airboy1999,3,Mon Jul 6 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"The Surface 3 is completely silent. Given your needs, I'd say at least consider the Surface 3 again. Do you have a BestBuy or Microsoft store you can go to to check them out in person?"
Surface,3ccjhk,IvanLasston,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:55:11 2015 UTC,There is a best buy in a city beside mine that I can visit. On my next day off I plan to go look at them. I'm not going to buy anything until closer to Sept.
Surface,3ccjhk,DrFate09,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:20:16 2015 UTC,"Here is a review describing the fanless atom of the Surface 3. http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/01/microsoft-surface-3-review-one-of-the-best-tablet-laptop-hybrids Its like other tablets.  It may get warm but there is no noise - and really doesn't get hot.  I have played older 3D games (Pentium 3/4 era RTOS) and that is the warmest it has gotten (it isn't that warm)  I was saying for your needs - if you were set on the Pro - then probably the i3 is the way to go.  I mentioned everything else to bring up the Surface 3 may also meet your needs.  For the software you mentioned there is nothing there that the Surface 3 can't handle.    If you prioritize noise/fan then the S3 is worth a look.  If you prioritize battery - then being able to charge with USB may also help push you over to the S3.  Also - if you are a member of Costco - Costco's website has bundles for both the S3 and SP3.  For me the top end S3 with pen and keyboard for $700 was the right price performance.    Good advice - go look at them both side by side.  And also question how you are going to be using it.  The Pro is bigger and heavier.  Making it a good laptop replacement but not a great tablet device.  The S3 is overall better to hold in hand vs the SP3 without giving up a lot on screen.    If you are looking at close to September then the Surface 4 may or may not be viable.  There are rumors from a release with Windows 10 on July 29th, to October, to delayed even longer.  The delay argument has gotten steam because Microsoft just introduced a new SP3 with a core i7/8G/128G configuration that costs the same as the core i5/8G/256G version.  A new version is a weird thing to do if you are eminently going to be releasing a new SP4."
Surface,3ccjhk,DrFate09,2,Tue Jul 7 03:26:00 2015 UTC,I would go with the i3 model based on your needs of a quiet machine and not needing to use it for power intensive programs. I would consider storage space on the various Surface Pro 3 models when purchasing though.
Surface,3ccjhk,Justinw1970,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:34:40 2015 UTC,"So the i3 is a quieter model?  One more question. I read in a review that when writing on the SP3, it tends to slowly sink down but the S3 does not because of its stronger 3 strict placements. Is this true?"

The warranty/return situation is...problematic at best.   I suspect that due to the stated weight and thickness, as well as the unknown build quality, that buying one of these would just be money better put towards the actual cover.   If you do get one, post up and let us know, it is a mystery so far.   I bet the first folks to make a $20 ""just a cover"" would sell a few, though."

No need to cast from a secondary screen, has apps for Netflix, prime instant video (obviously) and a lot more, and it can also do Miracast and DLNA if you download the right app for it.

Chrome basically tells the chromecast to connect to the Netflix server directly and play the video (though you'll need to make sure it starts the video before turning it off).  If you're using the feature where you can broadcast other tabs/non-native video to chrome, the Surface will need to stay awake for that since it uses the Surface as an intermediary.  It's been since I've used it though, so it's possible things may have changed."

Surface,3c7qee,JavaLSU,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:19:15 2015 UTC,Does redditing or reddhub allow for custom themes on subreddits to be displayed?
Surface,3c7qee,solidus-flux,2,Sun Jul 5 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"Hi, developer for redditting.  I implement some parts of the theme, but not much.  Basically, I allow the use of inline images for a given sub.  Like team logos in sports subs or faces in fu712."
Surface,3c7qee,Batfan02,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:11:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think any reddit apps allow custom themes, because they are entire user interfaces developed from scratch using the reddit API. Subreddit themes are generally CSS, which is applied by a web browser."

Surface,3c8bt3,RchrdJ28,4,Sun Jul 5 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"There is one called TouchPal (http://www.touchpal.com/en/downloads.html); I tried it for a bit when it came out, and I didn't like the way it played with the stock touch keyboard.

Surface,3c8bt3,nmill11b,2,Sun Jul 5 23:28:49 2015 UTC,"What I really want is for the rest of the screen to become swipeable while the keyboard is up. So, rather than the keyboard floating over the lower half of the screen, I want the lower half of the screen to float upwards, so the upper half is off-screen, and if I want to see the upper half, I can swipe down and the on-screen keyboard won't move.  Like iPhone/iPad keyboards behave."
Surface,3c8bt3,aeschenkarnos,2,Mon Jul 6 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, but nothing stable or worth downloading. Like others have mentioned, W10 is a generous improvement on the current one, but I really hope we get something better still down the line. The touch keyboard is almost unusable in Windows, compared to mobile. Especially when I split the keyboard and try to hit the goddamn U key. I'll avoid typing when I'm not near my type cover just to not use the damned thing. It's probably the one thing that stops my surface from being a true iPad replacement. Not that I didn't sell my iPad the moment I bought a Surface 3."
Surface,3c9py7,XenonDragon,3,Mon Jul 6 05:00:03 2015 UTC,Yeah the only time I get 7hrs is when I'm just using MS Office. On a typical day I get 5-6 hrs.   This is probably not going to be a match for you.

A lot of people will say 8GB, and while I do agree with more performance = better, I don't see it benefitting your use case scenarios. My 2 cents.    •is the SP3 too loud to work at a library? I read a lot about some problems with the fans going on when just working with office and internet   Not louder than any other laptop.    •how loud is the type cover?   Best way to get a good idea about it is if there's a chance for you to try it out in a store. Mentions of its noise levels are everything from quiet to unbearable, so tough to generalize."
Surface,3c8r7v,EllipticSquare,2,Mon Jul 6 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"I'd go with 8GB if you're planning on gaming and your budget can stretch to it. Not saying you wouldn't be able to play those games on 4GB but that's just not a lot of RAM, you might struggle if you try to do several things at once and it's not futureproof so if not straight away, you'll eventually run into problems.  The fan is way quieter than my old laptop, even when it's running at full speed. It's definitely suitable for a library environment as it won't even be on unless you're doing something which requires a bit of CPU.  In my experience the type cover is really quiet. Again, far quieter than my old keyboard. The keys really don't make any noise. I guess it would depend how violent a typist you are, if you tend to stab keyboards with your fingers like you're poking out someone's eyes then it might be louder because of the empty space underneath."

I read a lot about some problems with the fans going on when just working with office and internet   It is not too loud to work at most library.  Most library has PCs around that are louder.

Surface,3cb4bt,desi_drifter395,3,Mon Jul 6 16:20:16 2015 UTC,"The problem with most ovens is that they're not temp regulated. If they say go 2 hours at 150F, even a decent oven is going to fluctuate, sometime 20 degrees in each direction - maybe more. That assumes your oven goes that low - mine doesn't. Plus you'll have radiant heat as well as conductive heat. If you have a convection oven, maybe it'd work, but if you can afford one of those, you have better options, like taking it in to repair.  The idea that a toaster oven on an extension cord (!) is any better is absolutely silly.  This article is nonsense. It's on par with the ""microwave your iPhone to recharge the battery"" gags that went around a while back.   If you want 150F temp, crack the windows on your car and put it in the sun on a warm day, and place your Surface in there. Then carefully monitor the temp via an IR thermometer for 2 hours. That's pretty dumb too, but less dumb than baking it in your oven, or god forbid, a toaster oven.   Ideally, have Complete on there and spend the $50 for a new one. And don't drop it in puddles."

Also if your device is no longer working because water is still inside let it evaporate the device might boot in a couple days.  If your device is still not booting then some sediment or something setteled between pcb traces or something making a contact where it's not suposed from there you have two choices clean the device with clean water(idealy distilled water). The other option is to disasemble the device and clean it with rubbing alcool and qtips (higher % of alcool the better).  Note that the disasembly and alcool cleaning methode can recover device that got sunk in coke and other sugar and sticky stuff but it's complex and time consuming.

Surface,3c7ky5,neonsword13,7,Sun Jul 5 17:13:55 2015 UTC,"First thing you need to know is that drawing on the Surface is going to feel very different to you after drawing with an Intuos for so long. This is true for anyone transitioning from a traditional tablet to device with a screen having an integrated stylus digitizer (wacom, N-Trig, whatever). Drawing on the smooth glass surface takes getting used to. It's a different drawing experience, but you will adapt.   As for lag, the only lag you will see is a slight delay between the onscreen cursor and the tip of your pen. This can be distracting for some people, but not others. Using basic medium sized brushes, there is usually no lag between what you see on the screen and the tip of your pen. Of course, with really big complex brushes, there will be lag, but that is true regardless of the device.  For me, the cursor lag is not an issue at all. My eyes track the tip of the pen more than the onscreen cursor, so I don't notice it.  You'll have no issues running Photoshop, SAI or Flash. The SP3 has more than enough grunt to handle those applications. The same goes for the Surface 3, but if you're intending to use it as your daily driver for drawing, go for the bigger screen of the SP3.  Line smoothness. This is a bit of a bug bear. If you draw very slowly, you may see some jitters as you draw with small brushes. I have seen it, and it's probably my biggest gripe with the digitizer. It's particularly noticeable when drawing line art, and I admit that I spend more time than I like fixing and refining due to the jitters. This becomes less of a problem if you use higher settings for pen stabilization in SAI or Manga Studio. It gets a bit laggier at the higher settings, but it does address the jitter problem to a large extent. To be fair, I should mention that I might be pickier than most people. I also noticed jitter in my previous Wacom device, so I'm somewhat used to it. It also depends on your drawing style too. For someone who does digital painting with a speedy paint style, it'd be a complete none issue.   You will also find that the pressure sensitivity will feel different from the Intuos. It feels like you need more pressure to activate the higher levels of pressure. Manga Studio has a very nice tool for adjusting the pressure curve, and the Microsoft Hub app has a basic tool that adjusts this as well.  As a drawing tool, the Surface devices can be really wonderful in the hands of a talented artist. There is an adjustment period that takes a while before you feel comfortable with it, but the payoff is worth it. But having said all that, be aware that there are other options for Windows-based drawing devices. Be sure to consider them all and know what it is that you prioritize in terms of functionality and features"
Surface,3c7ky5,blastcat4,3,Sun Jul 5 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've come to expect that drawing on an actual screen is going to be a bit of a transition for me. Heck, drawing on a tablet for the first time was a big learning experience in and of itself, but now I have to down pretty well.  And to be completely frank, the reason I'm getting a Surface is to get drawing more. If I have a dedicated thing made specifically for drawing, I'll focus on it and put much more time into it. That's why I want to know how well it performs as a piece of art tech. And so far I'm impressed with all the specifics of it that you listed but it seems I'll need to fanangle with it to find that sweet spot.   As for pressure sensitivity, well, it never worked on my laptop in the first place, so I'll just be happy to have it to be honest. But I imagine that'll take so time to work out as well.   Thanks for the help broseph. And like you said, I've got my eye on everything I can in terms of drawing products. As well as it's decently priced and works like a dream, it'll be mine."
Surface,3c7ky5,blastcat4,2,Sun Jul 5 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"The SP3 is a safe bet, but be sure to also check out the Lenovo Yoga 15. The newest model (just released) has a wacom pen digitizer, and with its 15 inch screen, it could be great for drawing. Still very early, so you'll have to hunt for user reviews, but it's very promising. Short video of the stylus in action."
Surface,3c7ky5,poopyheadthrowaway,3,Sun Jul 5 21:39:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless your 4-year-old laptop is running a Pentium/Celeron/AMD processor, it's probably not much slower (if at all) than the Surface Pro 3 or other comparable modern ultrabooks (e.g. http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-4300U-vs-Intel-Core-i5-2520M). You could always upgrade the RAM or install a SSD on your old laptop and it'll be just as fast as an ultrabook released in the past year.  Anyway, to answer your questions ...   The N-trig pen of the Surface Pro 3 has a bit of hover lag, but there isn't any lag once you actually put the pen to the screen. It's just as fast as an ultrabook + Cintiq combo. I'm able to do some simple animating in Flash without any issues whatsoever, but I guess this depends on how big your projects are. The only thing I use Flash for is to draw silly little animated gifs. Ntrig has jitter problems if you draw slowly. Wacom requires quite a bit of finagling to get good accuracy.   You can run TF2 on full settings at a lower resolution. In addition, pretty much any recent game will run as long as you lower the settings and resolution. But it's not very good at gaming.  I think you might find the Surface Pro 2 to be a better choice for your particular needs. It has the same processor as the Surface Pro 3, and it uses Wacom instead of Ntrig. The only downside is the inferior form factor."
Surface,3c7ky5,ratshack,2,Sun Jul 5 18:48:11 2015 UTC,"See, my step-mom has a Pro 3 but I haven't really had much time with it. She lost the pen the first day she had it so I haven't had a chance to draw with it either. But every time I've had a minute to try it, it was always fast and responsive. I turn it on and off and it's always speedy-quick. I've tried using external SSDs with my laptop and that doesn't really fix much. It's always been a slow piece a' shit.   Anyway, thanks for the answers. Good to know that the lag is pretty much nonexistent/unnoticeable. And I'm still pretty new to doing cartoons in flash so I'm not too sure what constitutes a ""big project"". I'm mostly doing stuff that's a minute or two long so I think I'll be fine.  And yeah, I was looking at Pro 2s also. They seemed to offer the what I was looking for at a semi-lower price. I'll keep that in mind if the specs aren't that much different from the SP3s. But I think the only thing really deterring me from getting an SP2 is the screen size. I'm very much a screen hog when drawing so I'd like a bigger surface area, but if it's a cheaper alternative, I may just have to make that sacrifice."
Surface,3c7ky5,poopyheadthrowaway,2,Sun Jul 5 20:39:42 2015 UTC,"the guts are almost identical, performance is the same but the Sp3 screen is so much better you will cry if you get an sp2."
Surface,3c7ky5,haZeDP,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:06:36 2015 UTC,"An external SSD won't help unless you're actually booting from that SSD (and even then, very few USB 3.0 external drives use full USB 3.0 speeds). Or maybe there's too much junk running in the background? Or like I said before, maybe it's a Celeron/Pentium/AMD processor instead of an i5/i7-whatever.  Also, keep in mind that there are a few alternatives, such as the ThinkPad Yoga (the 14"" or 15"" version has Nvidia GPUs which could help with gaming), Vaio, ThinkPad Helix, etc. But in any case, the SP3 should serve you very well. Just don't expect to be playing current games at max resolution/settings or run games that come out in a year or two at all."
Surface,3c7ky5,EllipticSquare,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:17:55 2015 UTC,"I tend to keep the thing running pretty smoothly - there's rarely any stuff running in the background unless I give it the go-ahead. I may just need to format it and get all of the garbage I don't need of if it. That might fix a few things.  And of course. I already have a nice rig that's capable of playing all the big new games coming out (but I'm going to need to upgrade it soon. Hard drive's acting a bit funky while booting). I'm just looking for a nice casual game device without resorting to my phone and a nice piece of tech that's able to keep me drawing. If the alternatives are up to snuff, I'll get one of those instead."
Surface,3c7ky5,AsleepOnTheTrain,2,Sun Jul 5 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"Game artist here. I've owned the first Surface Pro since launch and I've played a bunch with friends' and coworkers' later models and Cintiq Companions.   For the Surface, on the art side, most of the limitations are quirks that one must decide are worth the trade-off. The precision has gotten somewhat better as they've released new versions, as well as the performance, but I'll be honest and say you're more likely to have a better time with that tablet for real work. The Surface gives you some mobility, but you'll need a main laptop/PC and tablet/Cintiq for longer productive sessions. Look at the Surface as an extension rather than your workhorse. I'd consider investing in a better setup before abandoning for a Surface. I love mine, but mainly as a device I can do some light gaming and occasional drawing on. Sketchbook Pro runs fantastically, and I think that should be the benchmark for the sort of work that should be done on it.  Surface Pros actually run many games with good performance at low settings. The SP1 and SP2 do not utilize CPU throttling like the SP3, which can be a pain for longer sessions and consistent performance. Hearthstone and many low req indie games shine at decent settings in High Performance mode. Putting any game at max settings may be enticing, but considering the size of the screen you're playing on (and lack of discrete GPU), generally it isn't that important or necessary. I personally enjoy Steam in-home streaming for playing most games from my main rig, and the Surface is the perfect compact client computer.   Hope this helps!"
Surface,3c7ky5,TheTool90,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:08:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I still want to keep my tablet to a certain degree, but I also want to move on to something that will keep me more productive.   The reason I want a Surface is so I can get a more consistent workflow going. When I work at my computer or laptop I always get distracted by other stuff (aka games/youtube/other stuff) but if I have a dedicated device for drawing I'll be able to spend more time on improving, which is something I really want to do.   And to be fair, I'm much more of an amateur artist than a professional. I occasionally work on big projects but I'm mostly just a doodler. I do a lot of stuff like this in my free time: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CI8OX3eUsAAcmjz.png:large . But if I pick up a Surface, it will allow me to be more serious about my work.  And very cool to know that it's actually pretty decent when it comes to gaming. I don't expect it to be a workhorse, I just want to be able to play TF2 (favorite PC game) wherever I go. I also play a decent amount of rougelikes and those aren't very taxing at all, so I think I'll be fine. And I never considered doing steam streaming from my main rig before. That's actually a pretty good idea. I'll have to try that out if/when I get a Surface."
Surface,3c7ky5,ddproxy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:25:27 2015 UTC,"(Love your style, just sayin') If you're looking to not be distracted due to the device being dedicated for your intention of drawing, it's still a full-blown PC and it's just as easy (if not easier due to apps) to get to Youtube etc. for that bit of distraction.   That aside, I definitely think a SP3 will serve you well as it will exactly act as a drawing companion on the go.   If you're worried about hitting shortcuts etc. if you're not bringing the keyboard, then this little neat piece of software will intrigue you."

I don't know the MS retail strategy for 8.1 machines already sent to the store, that is all backroom stuff,  and it depends how complicated their supply chain is, between their own retail,  Web store, and resellers like Best Buy.

Surface,3c4ow6,BKachur,2,Sun Jul 5 05:52:26 2015 UTC,I'd be fine with it if they thinned the bezels for a larger even if only by a margin screen. That alone would make the device 'feel' like an upgrade since screen space is so limited already.
Surface,3c4ow6,loconessmonster,6,Sun Jul 5 06:00:19 2015 UTC,"I don't even feel like the bezels need to be thinned out, given the Windows and potential other software buttons (and maybe a RealSense camera?)."

Surface,3c4ow6,loconessmonster,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:19:05 2015 UTC,I'd like the adaptive bezel Intel demoed a while back.  When in tablet mode you get big bezels.   But dock it with the keyboard and the bezels disappear.
Surface,3c4ow6,partydolphin,2,Sun Jul 5 22:09:37 2015 UTC,I want USB 3.1 not Type C though.   Type C means MS is somehow going to try to make it even thinner which causes more problems than it solves
Surface,3c4ow6,DrLuciferZ,2,Sun Jul 5 04:58:29 2015 UTC,"You can get USB 3.0 without Type C, but 3.1 requires a Type C cable.  Thankfully, Microsoft isn't Apple, so I doubt we'll see them go for a thinner Surface just for the sake of it being thinner. Lighter, maybe, but not thinner."

Surface,3c4ow6,Danthekilla,8,Sun Jul 5 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"Didn't Microsoft promise the next Surface Pro would still work with the current docking station and other accessories? That means same form factor and same power connector.  Obviously, a newer model will have a better CPU and probably longer battery life. That's expected. Also, since it will be their first Surface released in the Windows 10 era, it will have to showcase those features. Windows Hello is the obvious one there.  Personally I'd like to see 16GB RAM options (which shouldn't be a big price bump over that 256/8GB option).   It will be great if Microsoft can't stop acting like Apple and selling accessories for ridiculous prices (the keyboards, charging adapters, docking station and even the pen are way overpriced). If you pay $1500 for a tablet, it should come with a free keyboard. Not including the keyboard in the advertised price means a surprise $130 surcharge which probably drives some potential buyers away  edit: I meant a 16GB shouldn't be a big bump..."
Surface,3c4ow6,EShy,3,Sun Jul 5 00:11:48 2015 UTC,"If the standard model came with a ""free"" keyboard, they would just raise the base price to make a similar amount of profit.  They are trying to make a successful business out of these high end tablets losing money of the venture will just make them shutdown the line.  Also lots of people (like me) don't have any use for the keyboard, it will be sad day when you are forced to have it, because you will be paying for it regardless."
Surface,3c4ow6,Danthekilla,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:05:36 2015 UTC,"The pricing for the previous surface pro generations was the same for comparable models and for the accessories (the only exception I remember was the cheapest model getting a $100 price drop). It will be hard for them to bump the price up by $130 and fool anyone.  When all of your ads feature the keyboard and your big selling point is that it's a tablet that can also be your laptop, not including a keyboard when I pay $1500 is outrageous. It might be a different story with the $800 model, but even then you're bumping the price by more than 15% for people trying to get the product you advertised.   I have yet to see a Surface without a keyboard in the wild (I do see a lot more of them in recent months). While some might buy it and only use it in touch mode or with some other 3rd party keyboard, I'm pretty sure that's a minority."

The Macbook sets the standard as to what's possible for this kind of device, and really shows just how poor the Type Cover and its trackpad really are. The Macbook has about the same key travel as the Surface, but it actually has some separation between the keys so your fingers can sense where they are, and has a sharp activation point so you can sense when the keys have been pressed - coincidentally this fixes my two primary complaints with the Type Cover's keyboard.   I work primarily on a Happy Hacking Keyboard, and am a regular competitor at typeracer.com, and I can type every bit as fast on the Macbook as on any other keyboard, in fact, I've set a number of personal bests with this keyboard. It's nowhere near as comfortable as the HHKB, but it works very very well for a 2lb device."
Surface,3c4ow6,haXona,12,Mon Jul 6 05:23:58 2015 UTC,"Reposting this from another one of these threads...  1) Do away with the 64 gb model.   -$799 for i3 with 128gb and 4gb ram  -$1000 for i5 with 256gb and 8 gb ram  -$1400 for i7 with 512gb and 8 gb ram  2) Skylake - A launch vehicle for windows 10 should have Skylake - which is designed to support all the new Windows 10 features.  3) USB C - and perhaps thunderbolt 3. The type C port would replace the power port, the thunderbolt 3 port would replace the mini displayport. The USB type A port would remain for compatibility with older devices.  4) WiGig (wireless AD) - to support wireless docking primarily - as well as for wireless displays, or connecting to peripherals or other devices.   5) Rezence Wireless Charging - this one I hope for, but am not sure if the tech will be consumer ready by the time the SP4 ships. Would be nice to drop my SP and my phone on my desk at the end of the day and not have to remember to plug them in - or be able to pick up and put down my device frequently and still charge it while it is down.   6) Iris Graphics - at least in the i7 model. Again, not sure if it will be included in any of the first wave Skylake U processors - but it would go a long way towards making portable gaming an enjoyable experience - as well as for 3D modelling software I use.  7) 4K Display - IF they can do it without making the battery life unacceptable. OLED technology might be the way to go.  8) Another incremental step forward in form factor. Slightly thinner, slightly lighter.  9) Intel RealSense 3D Camera - To support Windows Hello, improved Skype, and the other more niche applications.  10) This one is a bit more out there. Remember the ""blades"" they marketed for a little while? Different attachments which replaced the type cover? I could see myself using a secondary display attached in place of the type cover. It would have to support touch and inking to be really useful though - could get quite expensive. This way I could take notes on the bottom screen while course info or text is on the top screen. Or I could browse the web on the bottom screen while a movie plays on the top - etc.   11) Redesigned Cooling - I can accept fan noise and warmth on the back when gaming. The fan should not however be audible when browsing the web, watching a movie, etc etc. And it should never get so warm that it is uncomfortable to hold - when playing something like Civilization 5 for example.  12) PCIe SSD - The technology is mature and many competitors have begun to utilize it. Even faster hard drive speeds will make the system more responsive.   13) Another less likely but cool idea. By utilizing thunderbolt 3 - the Surface Pro 4 could support an external GPU - we already know this. But the surface form factor could lend itself well to a hard keyboard dock which would click in place of the type cover with an integrated eGPU. This would require a redesign of the bottom edge of the device, to include a thunderbolt 3 port and to allow for ""click in"" docking. A rigid keyboard dock would not be appropriate to attach via magnets only. The dock would also include additional battery volume."

Beautiful, even though the SP display is great it isn't as good as my Nexus 10.  I will say - it was nice, but not worth sacrificing battery life or gaming performance for. The Nexus 10 could handle most things at the time due to the powerful GPU (it wasn't bad at all, and the dual core CPU was really fast; it's still a fast tablet today). But 4K on Windows would be a mistake, IMO. Battery life would suffer too much in non-modern applications.

I've personally sold people on the idea of a Surface Pro of using it as a cheaper Cintiq/laptop combo.

If MS figures out a way to cool down the tablet a lot more than in SP3 then IRIS isnt out if the question.
Surface,3c4ow6,Kocidius,3,Sun Jul 5 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"No no no, why would you want it thinner? The Pro 3 is already incredibly thin, any thinner and we start to see significant reductions in battery life and performance"
Surface,3c4ow6,arthurfm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"Potentially. But Skylake is two generations past the haswell processor found in the SP3. It requires less battery and less room to effectively cool. 10 hour battery life and acceptable cooling are priority one, but past that I would prefer a bit more 'tabletability'."
Surface,3c4ow6,Kocidius,2,Sun Jul 5 04:10:22 2015 UTC,Do away with the 64GB model.   I don't think that will happen for the simple reason that Windows 10 uses up to 15GB less disk space than Windows 8.1 does.  http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/03/16/how-windows-10-achieves-its-compact-footprint/
Surface,3c4ow6,elomire678,0,Sun Jul 5 12:27:01 2015 UTC,Could be. But the cost of a 128gb is so low now that the added cost is nearly negligible - and the money they would save by supporting another configuration may nearly cover the difference.   We have the surface 3 as the entry level device. The surface pro is supposed to be a premium device - and a 64gb is not consistent with that.

Surface,3c4ow6,NineT4_,0,Sun Jul 5 12:29:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But considering they would be replacing the power and mini display ports, I would expect to have two of them.

A nice alternative would be to have a slot that holds the pen by its clip. Most importantly, the pen should be smart enough not to trigger any buttons while docked into the Surface this way.   Anything's better than the stupid sticker thing we use now, and I can't count the number of times I've accidentally clicked on it while the pen was attached to the shallow portion of the Type Cover."

Surface,3c4ow6,Hathos_,3,Sat Jul 4 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"There would be nice is they did it on the edge so the surface could still lay flat, and you could some kind of contact between the clip and the pen that when blocked would disable the pen, it would then work when clipped over fabric as well."
Surface,3c4ow6,brainandforce,5,Sat Jul 4 20:01:58 2015 UTC,"To fit a silo for the pen the Surface wouldn't need to be half an inch longer, it'd need to be about 5mm thicker."

Surface,3c4ow6,s0undwave,0,Sat Jul 4 22:13:06 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Maybe they could make the pen slightly thinner for the SP4? I'm not sure how people find the current pen...
Surface,3c4ow6,Squeebee007,5,Sat Jul 4 22:16:33 2015 UTC,"People love the current pen, since it was designed to be ergonomic. It would suck if they sacrificed that to make it fit inside the Surface."

They could move the heat to a specific area and vent from there. Maybe not, if they plan on switching to a fanless design next year.  I expect the cheap model (like the i3 right now) to be different from the others. It might have Core-M and a fanless design.  The pen will be improved. The camera will be improved. The kickstand will probably be tweaked.  Higher colour accuracy and less light leakage? Probably.  It might not have Sky Lake, but I'm hoping.

Surface mini 4: - Has an Intel Core M CPU. These are almost a good as the CPUs in SP3, but do not need fans (the macbook is using them for example) - around the same form factor as the iPad. - USB charging - Sell it for the same price as the iPad. Sadly this will not be possible because of the CPU. S3 can be made so cheaply because Intel feels the heat from the ARM CPU manufacturers, thus sells Atom CPUs for almost nothing (these have around 2W TDP). Their next offering, Core M-s are around twice as fast, have 5W TDP (a tablet battery can easily run it for 8 hours, see the Macbook), and are still fanless. The big problem is that an Atom CPU costs almost nothing (I guess under 50$ - there are tablets using it that cost < 250$) but Core M-s are 280$ alone ( http://www.cpu-world.com/Related_CPUs/BGA1234_Broadwell.html )"

To launch the SP4 with Broadwell after the arrival of Skylake wouldn't make much sense.  Improving the pen experience is also something hat is pretty much to be expected. I sincerely doubt MS would invest in the tech only to keep it as is.  I doubt the screen's resolution will go higher, and considering they are sticking with low voltage chips, putting a 4K screen would be more of a con than a pro. I sincerely don't understand why some manufacturers insist on putting 4K screens on low powered devices that simply don't have the specs to push so many pixels. Then again, the same manufacturers were selling laptops with low ram and slow CPUs running the at the time very demanding Windows Vista.  As for what would be a nice surprise to me, better cooling to avoid throttling on the i7 model, 16GB of ram for the high end model and, who knows, a decent GPU. For the GPU, I hope they at least go for a decent intel integrated one, although I'd love to have a low powered one from nVidia. And I certainly wouldn't mind having a second USB port."

Here's my wishlist:   Skylake and lower temperature of the device/less or no throttling. Back camera that can focus up close. The main reason I'd want to use the back camera is to take pictures of documents. Better trackpad. I've probably been spoiled by Apple for the last 7 years but the trackpad is a bit lack luster. Improved n-trig tracking, removing some of the jitter at low speed would be great for drawing. Price adjustments. I don't think it needs to be a whole lot, but the current base models seems barely useable. I think it would be possible. I don't expect the design to change a lot and Microsoft seems to be selling quite a few of the Surfaces and it's getting good floor space in electronics retailers. The hi-res display was probably very expensive at launch but prices are probably starting to fall on those as hi-dpi is getting quite common. Full size SD - both for plugging in my camera's card but also for affordable and fast expanded storage on the device.  USB type C with thunderbolt on top of the existing 3.0 port. I think most of my whishes have been quite reasonable and this is my one crazy wish. Adding a Type C connector would be great for a few reasons. The device could be charged with a battery bank. I expect we'll see some nice type-C docking stations very soon. I'd love to see a feature like Apple's target disk mode come to Windows. For those not familiar, target disk mode allows you to boot a host computer from the disk in slave computer's disk through Firewire, thunderbolt or ethernet.

I've been noticing a similar issue; rolled back (Device Manager->Network Adapters->Marvell...->Driver tab, roll back) and didn't see any appreciable increase in performance (1.7-2.8Mbps down both intranet & Internet, 5-6Mbps up Internet upload cap).  Swapped to tethered (WiFi) connection, got 30+Mbps with old & new driver.  I had also tried rebooting my AP, an ancient Asus RT-N112 (router behind it is rock solid and every other WiFi and wired connection is ~30-35Mbps speed), restarting the Surface, turning on and off 'packet coalescing' etc.  Getting a new/modern AP in a few days; will post back to see if it improves things.  Edit: New (ac) router is giving me full speed on the new driver (still on 2.4GHz).  I'd solidly put this down too poor compatibility with slightly older router/AP hardware and the obviously middling-QA of the Marvell drivers."
Surface,3c5qoh,Snozaz,6,Sun Jul 5 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, you use the very same pen for either Surface 3/Pro 3. Only performance difference comes with the speed of the Surface and whichever art software you use. A big, complicated brush vill stutter more in Surface 3."

At the time there was no other option, and I had already skipped on buying the SP1.Its perfect otherwise, I can run steam games, d2, and starcraft no problem. In hindsight I should've gotten the Thinkpad Yoga because it has a larger screen. Hopefully SP4 is a beast, its time for me to upgrade soon."
Surface,3c5d0m,loconessmonster,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:53:20 2015 UTC,The aspect ratio and the screen size are the only big problems for me as well. Although I'm not sure if it's worth giving up the 4gb of ram on the SP2 to get the S3 that isn't as powerful but has a better aspect ratio for me.
Surface,3c5d0m,triffid_boy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:48:24 2015 UTC,Surface Pro 2 is more powerful than the Surface 3 (I am particularly noting that OP does not say surface pro 3).   The screen isn't enough to make up for the difference in that case!
Surface,3c5d0m,loconessmonster,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:19:46 2015 UTC,"I've grown tired of how small my SP2 screen is, the aspect ratio doesn't help either. Yes the S3 is barely larger but the slight increase in resolution and aspect ratio make a world of a difference. If you're just a 'casual' user you won't notice too much of a difference in performance between the two but you will notice the screen.  If the SP2 screen were slightly larger and/or had a different aspect ratio I wouldn't even bother to keep up with the news to see what the SP4 is going to be.  If you own a SP2 then spending $$ to get a S3 is not worth it. IMO if you're buying a new device now don't get a SP2 because you'll regret it due to the screen."

The rest is just splitting hairs, although there will be a slight performance difference, not enough that you should base your whole opinion on that alone. Of course a desktop is going to beat a surface your example was not relevant to the discussion.   The performance difference when using chrome and word processors and other 'light' programs between the S3 and SP2 is going to be negligible, if you're really worried about it then buy the model that has 4GB ram.

Surface Pro is no different than any other pc. More ram is always better. With that said, depending on what you use your surface for.. 4GB maybe fine for you. The machine runs incredibly well with 4GB. 8GB will just allow you to run more memory demanding programs such as video editors, 3d modelling/rendering applications, photoshop although 4GB runs fine with it.   In general.. 4GB is fine if you're not using programs that really need  more ram but again.. more ram is always better. It allows you to do more with less swapping. In this case, swapping will swap to an ssd so its not that bad with 4GB even if it has to swap."

Surface,3c4g9f,giantsparklerobot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:49:00 2015 UTC,There's really a handful of use cases where you would need the 8GB model. For most people 4GB is just fine. You can get by in Windows 8.1 with 1-2GB like found in the cheap BayTrail tablets and laptops.  Remember that Windows unlike Android and iOS can swap to disk if actual RAM runs low. It might impact performance you're not going to have apps crash or the system get unstable. The Surface Pros also have a fast SSD so in an instance where Windows starts swapping it's not nearly as slow as a traditional hard drive. That being said unless you're doing a lot of memory intensive things at once you will very likely never touch the swap.  I went with an 8GB model because for me running some VMs with Visual Studio or IntelliJ running on my 4GB SP1 could get very slow.

Then take a manual backup of all your personal files (so you can transfer them without restoring from the image). Now there's nothing to lose and you can upgrade to windows 10 to get the free license. Now you can either go back to 8 with the image backup from before, or do a clean install of windows 10 to remove any remnants of the old OS.

(I know, the price seemed too good to be true but I still bought it) I turned it on, played with it a little, and it worked fine. When I brought it home I realized that I couldn't use it for more than 10 minutes without it overheating and turning off. The guy sold me a defective unit. Luckily I contacted Microsoft and the SP3 was still under warranty and I got it replaced.   So my suggestions to you would be to load a couple of apps, watch some videos on youtube, and check for signs of slowing down or overheating. Try to use it for at least 15 minutes, I'm sure the seller won't mind."

I'll definitely take the device for a test run when the time comes!"
Surface,3c1zr1,oZiix,31,Sat Jul 4 00:48:27 2015 UTC,I haven't seen a full tablet preview before.  Looks great!  I think I'll be using my SP3 in tablet mode a good amount of the time.  Love the back button always being there. Works the same way as it does on Windows Phone. And having the full task bar then whenever you want it is great.  And if anybody doesn't like it they don't have to have it shown. Microsoft is nailing W10 so far.
Surface,3c1zr1,crackthecracker,7,Sat Jul 4 01:03:49 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree this was the best Tablet mode preview I've seen so far.  I looked at a few others, but this hit the area I was most interested in, which is intuitiveness.  Watching the video everything just made sense I'd say maybe swiping in from the left would be something you would figure out later, but you can accomplish the same thing by holding the back button.    It also looks like running a surface 3 in tablet mode all the time doesn't compromise the experience at all.  I have a ultra book and the type cover was kind of one of those things that made me feel I would have to spring for it if I bought a surface 3, but after watching the video I think I can just buy the S3 on it's own and be just fine.  I was hoping I didn't feel like I was losing anything for productivity by staying in tablet mode and this video pretty much showed me that everything works well together.    Now I'm hoping Microsoft does a special pricing promotion for the S3 on Win10 launch day."

Surface,3c1zr1,ThatActuallyGuy,4,Sat Jul 4 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"Do people really not know about swiping in then out to get a list of recent apps? You don't have to swipe 4 times in 8.x to get to a 4th app, you swipe in and out then tap it with your thumb. It's also more convenient because it's a list on the left side of the screen using small thumbnails so everything is right underneath your thumb, vs the hunt and peck required by Win10.   The very issue he has with horizontal scrolling in win8 is the issue created in win10 task switcher, needing to use an index finger and thus holding the tablet with 1 hand. This issue is replicated in his suggestion of switching tasks in tablet mode by showing apps on the taskbar, you still have to pick up your hand to access the bar as it's not on either side where your hands would be.  Otherwise, they've dramatically improved the tablet experience in [very] recent builds, but Win10 is still slightly less convenient for multitasking. Now we just need app makers to update their interfaces to replace app commands with hamburger menus, as win10's design breaks app commands."

And the fact that a supposed ""expert"" didn't even know that swiping in from the left has always brought up the task switcher, showing all currently open apps, just proves my theory that most critics of Windows 8 never used it long enough to have a clue just how good it was.  But none the less, bring on 10 -- it looks fantastic.  It truly is an elegant refinement that melds the best of both worlds.  I will have my PC set to Tablet mode as the default.

Two finger swipe from the left for Windows 8 style switching single finger swipe from the left for task view. Another complaint I have is that in so many modern apps the settings are hard to get to. In tablet mode when you swipe down from the top they should just have a gear next to the hamburger menu, and to make the bar larger...that would solve so much."

SSD.   thats what i meant about debateable, since most users and use cases are not going push either machine.   basically, you are mostly right, but im not entirely wrong and thus...debateable."

Surface,3c5mou,zhenya00,2,Sun Jul 5 01:31:25 2015 UTC,"Again, it's not like I wouldn't use it. I'm sure these features would come in handy, but for me they're more of a bonus, not a prerequisite. I mostly started looking at the Surface due to it's decent build quality, nice screen, and the fact that it actually runs a real OS, not a tablet OS. All that, combined with the ""low"" price made me consider purchasing it. (By low, I mean compared to other thin laptops. Any other ultrabook starts at at least $1000, and if you want one with a nice touchscreen like the surface that will cost at least $1300.)"

Surface,3c4ojd,orlyrlyowl,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:30:27 2015 UTC,"The Surface 3 is an ideal device for a student, particularly if you have a more powerful machine to pair it with. It's a much better tablet than any of the Surface Pro devices, IMHO, due to its light weight and fanless design. It runs full Windows and supports a pen, so you have the best of all worlds.   I think you'd be happy with the base model performance wise. Again, as a companion device it will be fine.   If you were choosing a Surface as your only computer, then an i5 or better Pro 3 would be my recommendation.  Whatever you decide, do sign into your computers with your Microsoft Account to take advantage of syncing all your settings and documents via OneDrive. Makes working with multiple machines much more seamless.  The Surface 3 comes with a year of Office 365 too. And you will qualify for an educational discount for your Surface."

The streaming features of Win10 only apply to Xbox One, and there is no confirmation that that feature is coming in the RT update.

Surface,3c1p29,WellTheWayISeeIt,3,Fri Jul 3 23:09:58 2015 UTC,"1 - Pair the pen by holding the top button until the light starts blinking.  Add the pen to the Surface under charms -> settings -> change PC settings -> PC and devices -> Bluetooth.  Note that I couldn't get it to work with OneNote Desktop with the 2016 preview.  Works with the Modern OneNote just fine.  2 - It's as you say.  Charms -> Settings -> PC and Devices -> Mouse and Touchpad -> at the very bottom There is a pull down.  Above it says ""To help prevent the cursor from accidentally moving while you type, turn off taps or change the delay before taps work"" -> Choose turn off taps.  3 - It doesn't seem to work like a Mac trackpad.  In Mouse and Touchpad again you can play with the settings.  I am trying scroll multiple lines at a time but setting the number of lines to 1.  Seems to be more reactive - but it sounds like you play with these settings.  I've not found one that really mimics the Mac but if someone has a way I'd like to know as well.    Mouse bonus - Also - in Mouse and Touchpad - Allow right-clicks on touchpad means the lower right of the touchpad counts as a right button.  Two finger click is also a right click.  I turned this off as I kept getting right clicks I wasn't expecting.  Two finger click still works with this off.  4 - Haven't found a better touch tool for the trackpad.  There is something similar for the touchscreen though.  Search the App Store for TouchMe Gesture Studio.  That is free but you need to buy a $5 TouchMe Engine from within the App.  This will give you gesture customization for the touch screen at least.  (Missing the back gesture is a big pain for me as well on the touchpad.  You could always use the keyboard alt-left arrow.  I've reverted to it)  Desktop wise I haven't found anything. http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/touchme-gesture-studio/740d3578-ddb4-4f74-b489-5a3782cb7607  4a - Modern Internet Explorer does support some gestures like two finger swipe left and right for back and forward on the Trackpad.  But that means you have to use Modern IE.  Chrome supports finger swipe on the touchscreen but not on the trackpad (that I've found)."

Surface,3bz1j4,Arguno,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:24:42 2015 UTC,Try to limit the CPU. Google for processor performance state registry. This will enable the option inside battery settings. It is not underclocking but similar. You are limiting the max frequency the CPU can reach and that means lower hest and that means more constant performance because if it is too hot the surface will throttle the CPU.

When you log in using the native Remote Desktop Client to a Windows 8.x or newer system, the remote host detects the desktop scaling level in use by the client, and scales the UI to match; there is no need for hacks.  This does have the same limitation that exists in Windows generally: To get a new desktop scaling level to take effect, you will have to log off of any active remote session and then log back on again.   Still, it's a very welcome improvement and works great if you are fortunate enough to be running the latest versions of Windows Professional or Enterprise on your network.

IE very dark greys will register as black. This makes it impossible to do colour accurate work (drawing, photo, video...) and it means that what you're seeing isn't what the creator intended like very dark scenes in a movie can loose a lot of details....

Surface,3by29j,SomeSortOfGlansberg,4,Fri Jul 3 04:17:37 2015 UTC,"That's actually a pretty good card. Its a class 10 and I use them in my DSLR (which writes a lot and quickly when writing in RAW format) and it is able to keep up. My suspicions would be that because you are torrenting and the way torrenting works is it is keeping the card really busy. Your torrent software basically opens many, many connections to other PCs on the net and downloads a small portion of whatever it is you are downloading. So, I believe the Torrent software/OS is creating a separate connection internally to the SD card for each of those chunks. Normally if you copy a large file you have one internal connection, but in this case you have multiple connections for tiny file chunks. This then causes your OS to hit some kind of hard upper limit which then restricts further access to the card. I am making an educated guess here and totally made all of that up, but I work as an engineer and very closely with network and file protocols, so it wouldn't surprise me if it worked that way. One quick test would be to stop torrenting, then copy a large file (>1GB) to the SD card and then see if you can open a PDF.  Report back."
Surface,3by29j,brkdncr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:36:34 2015 UTC,"yeah I use them in my phone and camera too but I imagine it's not writing constantly to it like BT is. That is probably the issue as you and several other people have mentioned!  Your explanation totally makes sense. If I copy a large file, I can use the SD card a little better than I can while torrenting, but it's still sluggish (takes a while to open directories, etc.). Probably do need a better SD card at some point anyway :)  Thanks again!"
Surface,3by29j,idontwantanother,2,Fri Jul 3 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"Ultra (from my ancient sales memory) isn't specced like their extreme with a guaranteed sustained write speed, I think it's just a peak speed affair. However, I have the same card and mine is okay (holds my onedrive files, can play video and torrent to it). Maybe try the weird thing that sometimes fixes sd weirdness and uninstall the realtek driver in device manager under the USB heading, called realtek sd card reader or something."

Surface,3bwood,tocilog,2,Fri Jul 3 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"The biggest one would be that in Windows 8.1, the desktop is its own ""thing"". When you multitask you can only switch to the desktop but not single apps open on the desktop. In Windows 10, all desktop programs are counted as singular, switchable ""apps"". That is a huge deal for me. Also how you can use desktop apps in tablet mode is great, being able to multitask with them etc.  Also I find that the Metro/Modern interface with its horizontal scrolling never matched with how you hold a tablet. Scrolling left to right is not nearly as effective as scrolling up and down is. Windows 10 gives you a bit more usable interface in tablet mode than Windows 8.1, which wastes the space above and below the live tiles.  Also, Continuum. Having a Desktop OS when using it with the Type Cover/Surface Dock and then having it switch to tablet mode on disconnection from either of those things is so damn useful.  Then we get to stuff like the Mail/Calender apps in Windows 10. They are so much better than the Windows 8.1 versions!  There are other smaller things, but I have to study so toodles!"

At this point, the wake up cycle takes some seconds.   Microsoft introduced this hybrid approach with the Surface Pro 3, but this device wakes up from hibernation a lot quicker than does the Surface 3.  It might have something to do with the slower eMMC storage subsystem in the Surface 3.   Still, it's a minor inconvenience in what is otherwise a wonderful device."

Surface,3bwsog,BAMvsGAME,4,Thu Jul 2 20:12:21 2015 UTC,No Surface model is really good for gaming. The Surface 3 CPU is roughly equivalent to a Core 2 Duo when it can use all four cores. Many games are not going to utilize all four cores so you'd get far below a Core 2 Duo equivalent. The GPU on the Surface 3 would be adequate for older titles at lower resolution but no modern AAA games.   The SP3 has a beefier CPU and GPU but it's not much better for AAA gaming. It takes a fair amount of tweaking to get decent performance out of modern games. Even then the performance isn't super impressive.   I don't know where you got the idea either would make good gaming machines. If gaming is your focus you'd be much better off with a traditional laptop. The Lenovo Y40 is a nice combination of size and gaming performance for a good price.

Having said that, if I was student age and planned to use it for school and general use, I'd strongly consider the S3. It's even more ""portable"" with way less heat involved, and battery life is better.

So I would suggest waiting until you start Grad School before you get it, so you can take advantage of that double discount.   Though i doubt it would be for the Surface 3, that would almost be stealing.  If you wanted to take advantage of a discount like that, go with an i3 SP3, it'll cost around the same as the Surface 3, and you'll get a lot more out of it."

I'm aware its just a standard windows tablet that some people have shoehorned linux on despite not totally supporting it. I'm just looking for some discussion."

I'm a firm believer in using what is appropriate for the job.  I have linux desktops but I certainly don't have to have linux or windows exclusive.  100% my opinion but linux works great in my servers, I'd never force my users to use desktop though.

Using the type cover for a lot of typing isn't the most ideal setup, but I may just need to get used to it more.  Since the Surface Pro 3 comes with Windows 8.1 Pro, you can install Hyper-V and run Linux VMs right from your Surface.  The SP3 is really just a laptop in a tablet form factor, so you get more functionality than a standard notebook computer. You also have the freedom to do whatever you want with it."

I rather be able to data track with my Icon, than letting it blanket run with a Surface, even though there is ways in the ""modern"" Control Panel to let the device know it is a metered use.  I am not sure what the fuss is about, I carry my phone with me anyways, and I definitely carry my Surface to do things. Battery burn with a phone isn't bad for the tethering, unless I am really remote and away from an outlet.

Thing is, I can totally see AT&T or Verizon ignoring the ruling that says we should be able to use our data however we want on plans that provide a limited allotment.  The ruling apparently didn't apply to unlimited plans, and I did get a C&D letter for tethering while I was on an unlimited data plan.  So I C&Dd."
Surface,3bqreo,formfactor,2,Thu Jul 2 03:36:27 2015 UTC,"There are several of downsides to having 4G in the tablet that I can think of:   You're paying a premium for two devices with radios instead of one You now have radio spectrum compatibility issues with a $1200+ tablet instead of a $300-$600 smart-phone You have a separate data plan charge you didn't have before You're burning extra battery power in your tablet to run a much more powerful radio that wouldn't be necessary if you tethered (most people have their smartphone with them anyway) You are potentially locked into a cellular carrier that you can't easily change without replacing the tablet (more of an issue internationally?)   It doesn't bother me that some people value having it built-in, I guess it's just a convenience factor more than anything."
Surface,3bqreo,staiaoman,2,Wed Jul 1 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"Where I am, only the first of your points has any relevance, and it's minimal at best for someone looking into buying a mobile device. And most people would rather not burn their mobile phone's battery when their tablet's battery is far far larger. If I keep my SP3 tethered to my 930 the entire day, I'll run the 930 flat by 4pm or so. Untethered, it lasts well into the night. With a 4G USB modem plugged in, my SP3 still lasts me throughout the day, so why the hell isn't it 4G-capable?  Put it this way. I have the luxury of choosing between my SP3 and my 4G iPad Air 2 whenever I go out for a meeting. While I'd like to bring my SP3 everywhere, I can't. Meetings don't always occur in places with wifi, and tethering is an extra step and extra battery drain. I have enough meetings that I'd rather pay an extra $10 a month for a 2nd sim card that shares the same data plan as my primary sim, and this sim card goes into the iPad, which goes with me to my meetings. This extra charge is negligible. The same thing happens for many salespeople who have to be mobile and need certain information updated (and to be updated) in real time. Not to mention that when traveling, I don't want to fiddle around with wifi hotspots and tethering all the damn time. A 4G-capable tablet just works. Period. And none of those downsides matter when you're stuck with a dumb tablet when you really need that net connection."
Surface,3bqreo,JeremyMcDev,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:18:21 2015 UTC,"Two of your points are about money, and I conceded that money is the only reason I can think of why someone would not want to have 4G in the tablet. They usually cost $100 more, and you're paying a minimum of $10/mo to add it to an existing shared data plan. So two of your points I already agreed on before you replied.  I disagree about battery consumption. Just because you have your cellphone on you doesn't mean it's constantly using the 4G radio. Those radios are battery hogs, but not as much as the screen. So with a WiFi hotspot, you're running the 4G radio nearly constantly on your phone, while also running the WiFi radios in both the phone and the tablet. Whereas if you just had 4G in the tablet, you'd essentially be running two WiFi radios less total. There is literally less components being used in this case, which in theory means less overall battery consumption.    Think about it: you're either running a 4G radio in the tablet or in your phone. So that point is moot. But with WiFi tethering, you're also running both WiFi radios.  You're also not addressing the convenience factor. Whether or not that convenience factor is worth an extra $100 up front and $10+ per month is up to you. But it's far more convenient to always be connected to the internet than it is to have to manually set it up from your phone each and every time you want to use it. I never use my tablet on the bus, I always use my phone, and if I had 4G on it, you can bet your ass I'd use it. The convenience factor is strong enough to be the difference between using it in certain cases and not using it at all.  I never bought one, but literally if the only barrier is cost, and cost becomes a non-issue, I feel as though there is no reason to tether to your phone at that point, because having 4G natively is more convenient all around."

Adobe's cross platform focus has resulted in apps which use their own UI frameworks in lieu of the native OS controls, hence many things just don't work with modern Windows.

No one sells 512gb MicroSDs right now, hopefully you didn't spend a lot of money on it. Run an app to check authenticity or try to write a large amount of files to it and see what happens, it's not actually 512gb, it's probably like 4gb if youre lucky.

Surface,3bslms,fat_genius,10,Wed Jul 1 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"It will charge normally.    Electricity has two important properties listed on any AC-to-DC charger (laptops, phones, etc.) - amperage and voltage. Amperage times voltage equals wattage.  You need to always match voltage between device and charger. A 5V usb charger will charge any device that can take a 5V charge (which is just about any USB device except really weird stuff like the Dell Venue 11, some Lenovo laptops, and the ASUS Transformer TF300). You have a little leeway - for instance, 5.1-5.3V will be fine on a device rated for 5V.  Amperage is the maximum load a device can pull from the charger without overheating the charger and causing a short or a fire.    So, a 13W Surface 3 charger is actually 5.2V times 2.5A (amps, or amperage). The device tells the charger how much amperage it needs, which means that a charger with a listed maximum amperage of 2.5A can provide any amperage at or below 2.5A to a connected device.    In fact, some phones will charge faster on a higher-amperage charger if they're designed to pull higher amperage when available for the purposes of fast charging.    The same rule applies for laptop power adapters. Dell and HP use the same tip across most of their chargers. A laptop that uses a 120W charger (19V times whatever amps) can use a weaker 19V charger (e.g. 60W or 90W) - it will just charge the battery more slowly or may disable battery charging entirely but still power the laptop."

If you like the RT and it does what you need and the only problem is the battery, there's no cheaper solution than fixing the battery.  Sure, you could go get like a Stream 7 or something for about the same cost, but you may not be happier with a smaller device with no keyboard and crappier build quality (low end plastic is no comparison to the vapormag body of a Surface)."

Surface,3bsxn0,BusinessManJackson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:57:03 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I've got a SP2, but the 128gb model. As a working computer, doing audio / photo work, I have about 30 gig of working space most time, so 64bg might be an issue for you.  I Risk of Rain regularly, this thing is a great RoR machine! No lag at all. I play a few games on it, even Geometry Wars 3 runs great at 720p (which is how I play most games).  It's my main field recording machine now, I just did a 12 input session with a band running Cubase and recording through a Motu Track 16 (on usb) running Reaper. Absolutely no issues, it was absolutely fantastic.  If you're looking for a cheap workhorse however, you'd be better off maybe getting a Lenovo T420 or something. They're your salaryman standard, fast, repairable and expandable. The Surface is more of a super portable specialized device. If you don't need it for doing wacom pen stuff, think alternatives.  Let me know if you have any questions!"

Just because you can open up older tech doesn't mean you can fix it. Drives fail, drive controllers fail and don't think SSD/Flash is bulletproof because data can be corrupted on any device. One should always assume that any drive in use can fail without any warning and at any time...because they do and they do it all the time.     Use OneDrive, use Dropbox, use Crashplan, setup a timed backup to an external drive or even just the local mSD but do something to ensure that you have a seperate copy of the critical stuff somewhere else.    OneDrive is on by default so your friend had to choose not to use it during initial setup. Without an alternative backup plan, that was a bad move.   I do not see an easy answer here, removing the SSD is only recommended if the value of the data exceeds the cost of buying a new Surface."

Everything is working fine.  I also watch videos off of youtube and vimeo - HD and regular and have little problem.    From what you are describing it sounds like you are running out of resources.  Right click on the task bar on the desktop - and open task manager.  There is a performance tab there where you can monitor your RAM and CPU.  To be honest - I have my Surface loaded up with Anti-Virus, my corporate VPN, Google Drive, Box, One Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud, as well as Steam.  These are all sitting in my tray.  According to my Task Manager my memory is 2.8G of 3.9G with Chrome and Dropbox taking a lot of memory.  If you have the 2GB version - then you could be running out of RAM pretty quickly.    I have a smaller HP Stream 8 - that only has 1GB of Ram - and it behaves the same way.  If I only do 1 thing at a time - and I use the Modern Apps - everything seems to be OK.  I start opening Chrome and Firefox and performance degrades.  Firefox and Chrome both can run resource heavy - so even if you think you are just looking at a text website - you could be taking a lot more resources than you think.

I think that the average person has a tendency to perform one too many swipes trying to get to their desired window and they end up having swipe through everything again. That's why the swipe and select exists. It does seem a bit overkill if you generally only have a few workspaces to swipe through. Similarly with brightness levels the average person had trouble with the fine motor control to find just the right level and then they bump it in the process of removing their finger from the screen.  When you say ""start screen"" are you referring to the full-screen start, or the new (old?) pop up menu with tiles that still shows the desktop?  Although I realize you prefer things that were quick single-finger gestures, you can perform fine control of the brightness through Settings / System / Display -> Brightness Level control. Unfortunately this doesn't allow you to add your personal favorite brightness levels to the cycle options in the new brightness tile."
Surface,3bqsmc,Nausky,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:20:41 2015 UTC,"you can perform fine control of the brightness through Settings / System / Display -> Brightness Level control.   I can see the point of having the presets to prevent accidental blips of the screen, but I vastly prefer being able to adjust this in place, rather than menu dive.  Couldn't it be both? Tap to cycle presets, long-press to bring up the slider?  I like 10 for my laptop much better than 8.1 (mostly), but the notification panel doesn't work as well as the charms bar did on my Surface."
Surface,3bqsmc,Nausky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:14:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly as an SP3 user, I have several beefs with the new start but the biggest actual usability issue is the numerous tiny icons that they've put at the very bottom of the screen. The type cover folds up, making these buttons nearly impossible to press. They're small and way too far down. All apps (from start) comes to mind. 8.1 was good about not putting anything too far down on the screen, and nothing was ever just flat out too small to tap.   Sp3 users that keep the type cover folded up usually move their task bar to the right or left side. Ideally, it would be great if they put more padding for everything on the bottom so we wouldn't have to move the task bar. There's very little option that looks good with the current resizing feature.   Also I think everyone would really appreciate a way to swipe between workspaces via touch (no trackpad). I really miss swiping through my apps, so it feels like a step backwards to have to swipe in and then choose a workspace to swap.   I think ""most used"" in the start is painfully redundant and should be something we can either disable or customize. I don't think we need tiles and that.   :) sorry, I'm sure you didn't need this big ramble."

Surface,3bpw6v,kab0b87,5,Wed Jul 1 04:55:24 2015 UTC,"i5.  The i7 model isn't enough of an improvement to warrant taking half the drive space.  I'll explain briefly.  Looking at the specs: both the i5 and i7 are dual-core hyper threaded CPUs.  Normally, in desktops, the i5 is a quad-core with no hyperthreading, in the ULV CPUs (that the Surface Pro uses), it is a dual core with hyperthreading;  Comparatively, the i7 in desktops typically is the same as the i5, but with hyperthreading, to give the CPU a bit more power when multitasking; in the case of the ULV CPUs, the i7 is ALSO a dual-core with hyperthreading.  There's no significant technological difference between the i5 and i7.  There's only two reasons to go for the i7 model IMO:  1. better GPU, but the difference between the Intel HD graphics 4400 (in the i5) and the Intel HD graphics 5000 (in the i7) is slim to say the least.  2. HDD space. the i7 is the only variation of the Surface Pro that has a 512GB drive.  Since you're not going for the biggest drive, there's no reason to get the i7.  Technologically, the i7 doesn't make sense.  ... and this comes from someone who BOUGHT an i7 SP3."
Surface,3bpw6v,MystikIncarnate,2,Wed Jul 1 10:41:44 2015 UTC,I definitely have to agree with /u/MystikIncarnate  here. I have no idea why they even bother with the i7. As soon as I got an i5 one to compare with I nope out of there and quickly sold my i7 SP3. I might even considers having i7 a con since the power / heat generation vs performance is completely imbalanced. It pretty much throttle all the time and you end up running at an overall lower speed than an i5. While having less battery cause the fan has to work harder to take the heat out. Since the i7 actually lose to i5 in performance per watt.   i5 4300U    HD 4400 (GT2)           11.5 W / 800 MHz    15 W / 1.9 GHz   2.9 GHz  vs  i7 4650U    HD 5000 (GT3)   N/A 11.5 W / 800 MHz    15 W / 1.7 GHz   3.3 GHz
Surface,3bpw6v,id000001,4,Wed Jul 1 16:24:06 2015 UTC,I'd go for the i5 with 256GB of space. Even though you may not use it I buy and sell electronics frequently and the extra space will make it an easier sell versus less space but an i7.

Surface,3br7va,giantsparklerobot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:22:18 2015 UTC,I think to start with you should really ask yourself if you want to spend the money on either option. Even a Surface 3 is a bit overkill if you're just going to use it to browse the web and watch movies. You'd want to go the Surface route if by entertainment you want to play Windows games and want to run a more capable version of Office. If movies and mobile games are more your speed stick with the iPad.  That out of the way what Surface to get is an interesting question. The Surface 3 has a very nice high pixel density display and lasts forever on the battery. In terms of power the x-series Atoms are about as powerful as a Core 2 Duo and the GPU can easily handle older games. If you're looking for more portability go for the Surface 3.   The Surface Pros would be more appropriate as a full laptop replacement. I recently picked up an SP3 as a full time laptop replacement. When at my desk it's also connected to a second display so it ends up being a replacement for my desktop in some ways. If you just wanted to watch movies an SP3 would be a bad choice. In terms of CPU power the SP3 is about 2-2.5x the power of the Surface 3.
Surface,3br7va,giantsparklerobot,2,Wed Jul 1 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"I have an iPad and use it quite often, but I find myself longing for more functionality. My friend wanted me to get a Samsung Tab S, but I would probably prefer the Surface. I just want the ability to run full Windows applications.   I am definitely a tinkerer and a power user, so having full windows on the go will be amazing. I can do all the things I do on my iPad (YouTube, Reddit, light gaming) with the Surface, and I can do so much more as well.   So thus far I am pretty set on getting a surface. I already have a laptop (although it's pretty large at 17 inches) so it's not really portable. A tablet sort of is a sweet spot in portability. I thought about a small laptop, but I really like the surface package with the touch screen.   I won't be getting a keyboard right away, so we will see how I handle the touch interface in desktop mode. I seen a few things I can do to make it easier, like adding pinch to zoom to the desktop mode making it easier to press smaller things. Also adding gestures will help. Out of the box I understand it isn't the best, but after I tinker I think it will be more effective.   I'm not going to know for sure if it's the right product for me unless I buy it. It sounds great on paper- an all in one device that can do everything, even if it doesn't do it the best. Having a tool like that on the go seems like an awesome idea. Being able to stream my Steam games with Steam In Home Streaming will be fun. Also running my VPN application is a lot easier with Windows VS the android / ios solutions I have used.   I hope that explains my thought process a bit! I want an all in one device that I can take with me everywhere- having the power of a Windows machine at my fingertips everywhere I go. The utility!"
Surface,3br7va,Telstar1948,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"Oh I completely understand your thought process as it's the same reason I went for a SP3 instead of a traditional laptop. I wanted a tablet form factor but the ability to also use it as my development laptop. For me the 4GB RAM limit precluded the Surface 3.   You definitely sound like a Surface 3 would be the ideal machine, you get a highly portable tablet like an iPad with Windows capabilities. While buying my SP3 I played a lot with the S3 and the size on those is very nice. The screen looks very nice and is a comfortable size, especially if you're coming from an iPad's 9"" screen.   There's some good YouTube videos showing how the S3 performs with games. More intensive games need reduced settings but older games look like they run very well. Source and Unreal 4 engine games will likely be no problem. On my SP3 I got some high end microSD cards to put games on.  If you're thinking of getting a high end S3 definitely keep an eye on the low end SP3. They are in the same price range and you get a pen with it (and more power and screen real estate).

Surface,3bo6yi,IAmDotorg,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:13:59 2015 UTC,"That causes havoc with touch-enabled web apps, though -- the browser has no idea if the swipe is meant for the app or the page.   IMO, they should stick with a two finger back gesture... just as quick and easy, but much harder to accidentally trigger when scrolling around a page."
Surface,3bo6yi,a-ko,2,Wed Jul 1 12:07:55 2015 UTC,Every fucking touch-based browser has swipe to go back. And I never 'accidentally triggered' the gestures.

Surface,3bo6yi,SummersLights,0,Tue Jun 30 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I disliked the swipe. It was a great to quickly go back to your last app but it sucked for managing your apps and multitasking. This requires more actions but the functionality of it is way better."
Surface,3bo6yi,despitegirls,4,Wed Jul 1 03:07:27 2015 UTC,It works better when you set the left swipe to open apps versus opening the last used app. I think it would've gotten a better reception if it had the first behavior by default.

Surface,3bo6yi,hxkclan,3,Wed Jul 1 01:13:35 2015 UTC,It's gone in Windows 10. New way (app overview) is way more efficient imho.
Surface,3bo6yi,jhoff80,6,Wed Jul 1 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  I get that some people disliked just sliding your last app in (which was optional in the first place), but the problem is that now the Task View centers all of your apps in the middle of the screen.  Part of the genius of Windows 8's app switching is that you would swipe in from the left with your thumb (or in then out, depending on how you had your settings), and all of your apps would be in thumb's reach.  Now you have to do that and then take your hand off the device to touch an icon in the center.  Just one of many ways where Windows 8 made far more sense on tablets."
Surface,3bo6yi,cornystool,-1,Tue Jun 30 20:41:13 2015 UTC,There was nothing genius about how the default gesture worked. Disabled immediately on all machines in favor of the one true functionality. Win10 made it better.
Surface,3bo6yi,lohborn,6,Tue Jun 30 23:04:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's gone in the current preview. .  The replacement is a lot more clumsy to use with touch.   That being said, they are still making UI tweaks.  In the newest preview, all apps is easier to access with touch than it was in the previous build.   Leave feedback in the Windows Feedback app."
Surface,3bo6yi,jhoff80,0,Wed Jul 1 08:12:47 2015 UTC,"If you think they're changing anything major about tablet mode at this point you're crazy.  What we have now is the desired interface, and it's just not good.  If anyone at Microsoft cared about feedback on tablet mode, they'd have been paying attention to the feedback in the Desktop>Continuum category that's been there since January (when we first saw Continuum in action), and has thousands of votes telling them how bad tablet mode is.  Instead, it's been completely ignored.  Windows 10 is a huge step backwards for tablets, and it's a shame they felt that was necessary.  I wouldn't ever say Windows 8.1 was perfect, but it'd be nice if at the very least, they built on that for tablets, instead of throwing out everything."
Surface,3bo6yi,lohborn,2,Tue Jun 30 21:30:34 2015 UTC,"I am still hopeful that some things are improved in tablet mode.  After all, there was a change that fixed one of my top five gripes in the build released yesterday.    I agree, however that if tablet mode doesn't improve hen it is step backward UI wise.  I suppose I will have to upgrade to get access to new apps but I have not reserved Windows 10 yet."

Surface,3bot41,dragoth13,2,Wed Jul 1 06:33:23 2015 UTC,"If you want a really good writing experience, get the Surface. None of the specs I'm seeing for the T100HA hint at any kind of active stylus like the Surface's. I owned a T100TA before my Surface 3, and tried a capacitive stylus on it once. It didn't work well. The digitizer wasn't sensitive enough to pick it up reliably. In contrast, the n-Trig stylus on my Surface 3 has been an absolute joy to use, and with the WinTab drivers, will work in pretty much any pen-enabled legacy apps as well.  For what it's worth, my T100TA gave me no grief for the 18 months I owned it. Yes, it charged slowly, like the Surface 3, but it had battery life that was much closer to an iPad's than my Surface 3's. That said, it used a much lower-power version of the Atom (Z3740) and was much less capable than the Surface 3 is (or the T100HA will be).  The thing the Transformers have going for them is the rigid keyboard dock. That big latch on the bottom of the keyboard lets you prop the Transformer up in your lap like a laptop, and lap use is still the Surface's weakest link, even with the three-position kickstand.  I've not had to use the warranty coverage on either my Surface 3 or my old T100TA, but I'd wager (from what I've heard) that Microsoft's support is nicer to deal with than ASUS' support.  Surface 3's advantages:   Phenomenal pen input Class-leading build quality Terrific screen Microsoft Complete is apparently pretty good   T100HA's advantages:   Will likely be significantly cheaper Keyboard is lower-quality, but included Better at being a laptop   Overall, I really like my Surface 3. Having owned a T100TA and being familiar with its form factor, I'd still go for the Surface 3 over the T100HA, even if the Transformer was $100-200 cheaper."
Surface,3bot41,Good_Honest_Jay,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:59:11 2015 UTC,"S3 also has a more powerful Atom..  X7 vs the X5 in the new Asus.   I think the Surface is a way better choice even if it costs more..  Just based on it's a Microsoft product, expect the best Win10 experience on it vs the rest..  Better firmware updates/driver support on the Surface too."
Surface,3bosyz,Mangobottle,3,Tue Jun 30 22:51:16 2015 UTC,"Lower the resolution to 1200x800 in any game you try, and always set shaders to low. In Heroes of the Storm with those settings, I get 60 fps. With every other setting on high, even. I can average 30 in Homeworld: Remastered with similar settings. I have not tested Starcraft 2, I'll give that one a whirl later.   Keep in mind that 1200x800 on a 12 inch display is 120 dots per inch (DPI) where as 1920x1080 on a 22 inch display is 100 DPI, so even at that reduced resolution on the SP3 you have a higher pixel density, meaning the image quality is just as clear. Unless you're looking at it through a magnifying glass, of course.   I also don't use an external fan."
Surface,3bosyz,Dreadp1r4te,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:48:48 2015 UTC,"When I use the term ""Playable on my Surface"" I'm referring games that I personally find to still be enjoyable with the resolution and other bells and whistles turned down. Obviously some games, require a high degree of graphical fidelity in order to fully appreciate. For example, a game like Bioshock Infinite needs to be experienced in at least medium to high settings in order to do the experience justice.   Games like Counterstrike, Skyrim or Fall Out, as pretty as they can look, are really more about the competitive experience/gameplay and head cannon then they are about pushing graphical benchmarks.  I've taken my surface to LAN parties and played without an external monitor or fan and it did pretty well. However, I find that optimal Surface 3 gaming is achieved at home with a second monitor and maybe a fan running next to it during the summer."
Surface,3bp68q,builtby,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:59:00 2015 UTC,"Windows 8 will be more stable than the Windows 10 Preview, definitely. No matter how stable it's gotten, it is still a technical preview, and there still runs the risk of BSODs, restarts, crashes, etc. The only question is if you think it is worth it to have Windows 10 early.   For me, I am considering installing Windows 10 early because I would prefer to do a clean install but I will not have the time at the end of the summer to do a full backup and a clean install, so I am considering installing it in the next week or so.  When I installed Windows 10 a few months ago I did not find it worth it at all. I had to restart at least once a day. Now I think it is a lot more stable and a crash every few days until it is completely stable is acceptable to me."

The issue is that it won't re-start charging the battery after the load ends. You have to unplug and re-plug the power adapter manually.  I get the same thing with mine, though not as frequently.

We've used the included factory chargers as well as the dock, and both work just fine.   This suggests to me that if you are having problems when using the factory charger, don't assume it is because it is micro USB.  You may, instead, have a legitimate issue with either your charger or your tablet.    Maybe Microsoft was shipped a bad batch of chargers from the factory, who knows?

Surface,3bm85v,_Raspoutine,2,Tue Jun 30 10:23:13 2015 UTC,"Obviously personal preference is one thing, but the Surface Pro 3 by default is actually pretty well calibrated in a technical sense:  http://www.displaymate.com/Surface_Pro_ShootOut_1.htm   The Surface Pro 3 also has the most accurate on-screen colors of any Tablet or Smartphone display that we have ever measured for the sRGB/Rec.709 Standard that is used in virtually all current consumer content for digital cameras, HDTVs, the internet, and computers, including photos, videos, and movies. Its Color Gamut is 97 percent, very close to the Standard Gamut as shown in this Figure. The Absolute Color Accuracy for the Surface Pro 3 is an Excellent 2.1 JNCD, the most color accurate display that we have ever measured for a Tablet or Smartphone."
Surface,3bm85v,foxox,2,Tue Jun 30 13:21:41 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was going to say... I showed my SP3 to a friend that works in graphic design and was surprised at the quality of the display/colors.
Surface,3bm85v,andrewhl2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:38:22 2015 UTC,Well it's true that it must depends on the model and luck. Mine had a really yellowish tone and this config really did save it.  That said the display quality is really awesome.
Surface,3bm85v,1337U53rR_PLZH4CKZM3,2,Fri Jul 3 14:19:44 2015 UTC,"You can likely get more pleasing colors by adjusting color by hand through the intel panel, but color accuracy/calibration is not really something you can do by eye.  Using someone else's exact settings isn't really going to help you either, because variation between displays exists and can be significant.  If you really want a calibrated display, get a hardware based calibration tool like a datacolor spyder5 or x-rite i1display pro or similar that can create an ICC profile for the display.  I definitely do recommend using the intel driver if you want to attempt any art/photo/graphics work on surface pros - it's been a while since I used microsoft's drivers, but the reason I switched to intel is because the stock display drivers did weird things like clip blacks and couldn't display smooth gradients.  Things to do after you've installed intel's drivers: access the intel graphics control panel by right clicking on the desktop and then navigate to power settings -> on battery (once you have entered the power settings menu from the intel control panel you need to click on ""Power"" in the upper left for a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the plugged-in and on battery settings - for some reason, the control panel always defaults to the plugged-in settings) -> disable ""Display Power Saving Technology.""  You'll also want to access the windows power options to turn off adaptive brightness (for both on battery and plugged in operation) for any power plans you intend to use."

Obviously if you compare it to a professional NEC or Eizo, it's ""subpar"", but it's just a faction of the price of those.  BTW, if you're serious in calibrating colours, please get yourself a colorimeter. Try Spyder for commercial and ColorHug for DIY enthusiasts.  http://www.hughski.com/"

If anyone wants it, I can probably throw the ICC up on Mega if I remember. It should get you in the ballpark."

Surface,3bm6f7,nocorvair,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:18:41 2015 UTC,Not sure why you are being downvoted because I think it's a good option.  I used mine for nearly a year and in all that time I didn't damage the screen at all.  What did happen is it developed a yellow tint along the left edge of the screen and so I was able to exchange it without hassle.  The screen seems pretty durable if you treat it nicely and a defect might show up regardless if it's protected or not so I think the complete coverage is well worth it.
Surface,3bm6f7,4grams,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:27:15 2015 UTC,"That's why I suggested it. I chose this route as the Zagg/MS protector is $50 and Complete is $149.  There are cheaper non-glass versions, but I suspect those are problematic in many ways. The math in me says two year full coverage surpasses screen scratch protection. One corner bump and the protector does nothing, but Complete will pay for itself instantly. Insurance is for those who can't afford to eat replacement costs or to be without."

For me OneDrive downloads seem to max out around 50 mbps compared to 120 mbps for other large files like games through Steam or the source websites for said movies.   As for uploads mine is only 10 mbps so I'm not sure if there's a cap. However, I'd imagine it's the same thing with downloads so even people with faster uploads or those on fiber will probably be limited by Microsoft's servers rather than their internet connection."
Surface,3bibet,WeeGigas,3,Tue Jun 30 00:07:44 2015 UTC,"Just curious is the media you're  storing to cloud stuff you've produced yourself or from the big name studios? I have a ton of movies which I legally own and would like to store in OneDrive. However, I'm wary of doing so because I'm not sure if this violates copyrights in some way or get mistaken for piracy by trying to share movies between my devices."
Surface,3bibet,WeeGigas,2,Mon Jun 29 23:42:29 2015 UTC,"Okay I took a copyright class last semester in law school, as a heads up, I'm not your lawyer, This isn't legal advice, I'm just explaining my understanding of the law...  TECHNICALLY, on a very technical strict construction level your violating copyright as your producing a copy on a separate machine without the owners perimission.   But on a non-technical, how the law actually works level, you generally have a right to make a copy of things you lawfully own for PERSONAL USE. That is if you watch it by yourself with up to 5-10 or show people that you know (there is a complex body of laws regarding 'public performance' that is outside the scope here). But suffice to say, there won't be liability for a personal copy of copyrighted work that you have a personal use license for.   ON a more practical sense there is no way that any company can legally look through your personal cloud drive to detect copyright violations. The way people catch copyright violators is when they download/upload stuff on torrents which is a constant and steady violation of copyright. This is different as they can't intercept or legally look at the uploads from a personal computer to your personal storage."
Surface,3bibet,BKachur,3,Tue Jun 30 00:06:14 2015 UTC,"But it is illegal to crack the encryption on the disks under the DMCA. So we have rights, but it is illegal to exercise them if you have to decrypt the DVD or bluray.  Edit: Added a word"

Surface,3bibet,loconessmonster,2,Tue Jun 30 01:27:51 2015 UTC,"That's a good point - I listen to the majority of my music through my Google Music subscription. I download a LOT of movies, but I delete them afterwards.  Now that literally everything is a 20 minute torrent away, I hardly ever feel like I need to keep a piece of digital media. I have an external hard drive for my photos - but my thousands of photos are hardly 10 gigs, if that."
Surface,3bibet,autovonbismarck,3,Mon Jun 29 18:09:16 2015 UTC,"Considering that both the i5 and i7 are low-power, dual-core CPUs, I don't see why anybody would buy the i7 version over the i5 version except for the extra storage.  This is a step backwards if you ask me.  And this is coming from someone who owns the i7 model."
Surface,3bibet,MystikIncarnate,2,Tue Jun 30 00:13:09 2015 UTC,Businesses. They want the i7 processor but already have network resources and cloud storage.

Surface,3bibet,MystikIncarnate,0,Tue Jun 30 01:53:24 2015 UTC,"Ehh, thats what i have too but now i want that i7...  That CPU is a workhorse.  Id probably rarely use it fully, but i still want it :/."
Surface,3bibet,formfactor,5,Mon Jun 29 16:06:43 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say no if I could get it for free but if I'm paying extra I'd rather have the storage space than the additional processor.
Surface,3bibet,4grams,4,Mon Jun 29 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"Not much more of a workhorse than the Core i5. Ultra-Low Voltage Core i7's are only dual-cores, all they have over the Core i5 is a slightly bigger cache and higher clock speeds.  Edit: And a better Intel HD Graphics 5000 over the Core i5's Graphics 4400 that could be better for gaming."
Surface,3bibet,Bitech2,3,Mon Jun 29 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"Indeed http://ark.intel.com/compare/76308,75114  Regarding the GPU, 5000 has twice as many execution units as the 4400, but I'm not sure how much this matter in practice.  The 4400 is driving the built-in display and a 4k external @ 60 Hz just fine. But playing 4k video is a no go."

Surface,3bibet,m0ny,7,Tue Jun 30 05:11:42 2015 UTC,"This just makes more sense to me, honestly. 128GB of storage should be plenty to house Windows applications and a little bit of media content. Most media is streamed nowadays except for those who set up home media solutions like Plex. The people that do that tend to have LOTS of media (several TBs) and utilize a NAS (or just an external HDD) so it's not like you could fit that onto the Surface anyways.  I know this won't feed everyone's needs, but the OPTION is what's important here. Good job, Microsoft."
Surface,3bibet,MABennett3,12,Mon Jun 29 18:04:37 2015 UTC,I wonder this new model means SP4 won't be coming anytime soon.
Surface,3bibet,id000001,10,Mon Jun 29 15:27:34 2015 UTC,MS has publicly said that other manufacturers (I.E. Intel will drive any major upgrades to the platform.  I suspect we won't see an SP4 until Skylake is available and stable.
Surface,3bibet,xeron72548,8,Mon Jun 29 15:33:58 2015 UTC,Man I was really hoping that it would come this summer. I'm going to college this upcoming year and the Surface is perfect for it. I don't want to drop $1200 for a year old machine though. I feel like a huge chunk of their sales comes from current and incoming college students. Why would they hold out on it?
Surface,3bibet,cericneesh,4,Mon Jun 29 21:00:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for a ""year old machine"", the SP3 is still kicking all kinds of ass, especially the i7.  I'll be using it happily until they come up with a SP4, and I do graphic design and animation."
Surface,3bibet,loconessmonster,4,Mon Jun 29 22:53:06 2015 UTC,"I suspect you are wrong that the majority of sales is from students.  I believe it is from enterprises who want a stable platform.  Additionally, I believe the are holding on to it so they can make as much money from engineering work already done and most importantly because there is no major HW platform upgrade available from their supply chain."
Surface,3bibet,green2425,2,Mon Jun 29 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"This is a good thing, this means when you finally drop 1k+ on it that it will have the latest processor. Find something cheap to use in the meantime and then sell it when you get a SP4. I did the same thing when I was waiting for SP2, the extra battery life was worth it since I had to hang onto the machine for a while.  I think a bought a different tablet with a wacom stylus for 500 and sold it for 400 when it was time to get a SP2."

Surface,3bibet,vadsvads,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:44:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can.   I use OneNote for literally everything. If you have a smart phone, I would recommend you get Office Lens. I use it to send the profs handouts into OneNote, where I can mark it up with the Surface Pen. I have my OneNote notebooks orgainzed by subject (Daily Planner, Mathamtics, Materials, Humanites, Intro Engineering, etc) and the class is the tabs (""ENG1102 Slides"" and ""Eng1102 Projects"" would be names for my tabs ). Then I put all the stuff in its appropriate section. I use OneNote to organize my to-do list, stuff I need to get done.   Also I would recommend you use the Outlook calendar, I have all my due dates, class times, group meetings in it. I am able to see events on the Outlook Calendar app on the Surface 3 and on my Windows Phone.   In addition make sure you use the OneNote clipper, it's really handy to send screen shots into OneNote.   When I'm in class I usually set up the Surface up just like a regular notebook on my desk. Her is an example of my notes. Just write on it like it's pen and paper, it feels pretty natural to write on. The pen is amazing, it is pretty solid feeling in the hand.   Right now I am writing a paper for one of my classes I just added a new page in the notebook and throw down lots of bullet points and ideas. Later when I feel I have enough content for the paper i'll start to organize it into proper paragraph format. When it's generally laid out, i'll put it into Word to properly format it (double space, font, etc).   The email app is really nice. You can add multiple email accounts and view all the emails at once. Makes it easier to mange all the stuff you'll get.   This is the basis for what I do with my Surface and OneNote. If you have any other questions i'll try my best to get them answered."

Surface,3bibet,Incrediblebulk92,5,Mon Jun 29 18:12:57 2015 UTC,In a session at Ignite last month when asked about the future of Surface and an expected date for SP4.   I believe it was either BRK2340 or BRK2337.  EDIT: I was in the audience at Ignite last month when the questions was asked and kinda answered.  Key takeaway is that MS engineered over 100 custom parts for it and now the SP3 is a success and MS won't change it up just because.  They will respond to market pressure and their supply chain.  I interpret market pressure to be more models at different price points and responding to competitive threats.  They said that the biggest influence on supply chain is Intel and any major upgrades to the platform will more than likely coincide with major upgrades from Intel.
Surface,3bibet,formfactor,4,Mon Jun 29 19:06:51 2015 UTC,"thought this as well, should be released this year and this could just be a way microsoft tries to round out its portfolio for the upcoming release of the sp4."
Surface,3bibet,Incrediblebulk92,5,Mon Jun 29 15:39:08 2015 UTC,So how easy is it to install native apps on an sd card on the surface? Seeing as SP4 is probably quite a few months away getting this and putting a big card in wouldn't be a bad cost saver.

I recently took it as my only device (including iPhone 6+) to a 3 day conference and it did absolutely everything I asked of it, from entertainment to actual work. The pen is so far above anything I've used with the iPads it's not even funny. I also have an iPad Air and haven't touched it more than once. It doesn't seem quite as stable as an iOS device, but it's close.   If you're looking for one device that can fulfill many roles, it's a great choice. I've found that OneDrive is another great multi-platform service that makes it easy to share between apple and MS products. Don't forget, you can always return it."
Surface,3blu35,Dreadp1r4te,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:48:39 2015 UTC,"Neat! I have MangaStudio, Photoshop, and Mischief, and I wouldn't mind trying a few others. I'm really excited about the weight -- carrying around my 6 pound laptop in a messenger bag was killing my shoulders.  Do you have any recommendations for Chrome alternatives? I heard I'll be using Edge when Windows 10 is released, so should I just stick with chrome until then?"
Surface,3blu35,Dreadp1r4te,3,Tue Jun 30 08:17:58 2015 UTC,"The thing you're going to love about it the most is that ultimately it's a tablet that's also a laptop. I'm not kidding, I use both modes on mine all the time, I'll prop it on my desk at work sans keyboard and watch Netflix while I work, or browse Reddit via Reddhub. It's so very fast and fluid that it outperforms most tablets I've seen. What really takes the cake though is that if I suddenly need to type a long-winded reply (i.e., now), I snap in my keyboard and suddenly it's a laptop, with all the features and power you'd expect. That level of adaptability has been attempted in the past and usually fell short due to OS limitations, like Android tablets with keyboards or keyboards for iOS devices, which have their uses don't get me wrong, but still don't have the full suite of Win32 applications at their disposal, not to mention USB, mouse, AND pen input support.   Then there's gaming, which if you decide to try some to pass the time, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what the Surface 3 can do. I've not used Chrome on Surface 3, but knowing how memory intensive it is on my desktop at home, I can imagine it being problematic on a low-RAM device like a laptop. I have used it on my Surface Pro 3 with 4gb of RAM, so I assume if you have the 4gb option Surface 3 you'll be fine. Once Windows 10 comes out, you may find (as I did) that Edge is a very nice browser that is ridiculously fast, and you might not need Chrome as much.   Finally, there's the shape and build of the device. You'll be hard pressed to find a device that looks as sharp as the Surface 3 and 3 Pro lineup. They're well made, with a solid feeling chassis without being too heavy, and they genuinely feel like a lot of build quality went into them. Even the keyboard feels rigid and sturdy, with the keys producing a satisfying mechanical click with impressive travel depth considering how slim the keyboard really is. Trust me OP, your money was well spent."
Surface,3blu35,Dreadp1r4te,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:03:07 2015 UTC,"This is awesome. I looked up a bunch of reviews before I made my purchase, and I figured it would be a good product, but that Total at the checkout was just sitting in my gut like a lump. Thanks to you guys I'm now convinced it's not a good product, but a GREAT one, and I feel much better.  What games have you tried on it? Have you had any experience with streaming steam from a more powerful computer? What do you use besides Chrome? I was hesitant to switch because of synced bookmarks, but if Windows 10 comes out in a month with Edge, I'll probably just switch to it across all of my devices, and import my bookmarks. Thanks for the advice! I'm so freaking pumped right now.  Last thing -- do you use a case? Do you feel one is necessary?"
Surface,3blu35,ICantReadThis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:26:09 2015 UTC,"For gaming, I've been immensely surprised. I've seen League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, and any game that runs the Source engine (Half Life, Counter-Strike, etc) run fairly well. I've also heard Unreal-engine based games work okay. I personally have run Homeworld Remastered on mine. You will need to turn down some of the graphics settings, but you should be able to play at 1200x800 resolution, which given the screen size of the device, is still higher DPI than a 22"" inch monitor at 1080P, and produces just as clean an image. I have used Steam's game stream on mine and it works flawlessly. I've remotely run Skyrim and Subnautica with no issues, although I avoid any multiplayer twitch-based games due to the tiny bit of input delay associated with game streaming, but that's a limitation of streaming, not the device itself.  As for case, I picked up a slim, attractive messenger style shoulder bag for mine. I won't say it's necessary, as long as you have the keyboard attached, but it's convenient to have my Arc Touch Mouse and Pen handy, along with a couple screen cleaning cloths., so I still recommend it if it's within your budget. If you opt out of a case, you can clip the Pen on to the keyboard while closed, sliding the pocket loop down the groove where the keyboard folds, i.e., here, for easy access and storage. Simply flip it to the other side when you have keyboard open or whatever you like.   Glad we could help! I too was apprehensive (I bought the SP3 at 999, plus accessories) about how much I had spent, but the amount of use I've gotten from mine is astounding. Literally any task where I've needed a tablet or a laptop, the Surface has solved effortlessly.   EDIT: Forgot you asked about Chrome. As I said, Chrome works fine on my device (SP3 with 4gb) but so does Firefox and naturally Edge, since I'm running Windows 10 10158. At the moment I only use Edge; I haven't found a suitable reason to deviate."

You've pretty much named all the games that I would ever find myself wanting to play outside my home, haha! (can anyone say on-campus league groups?)  I have two messenger bags I already use for school and if I needed to carry just it I know it would work in my purse, I can fit my 15"" laptop in there in a pinch right now. I'll grab a simple cover just to see how I like it, but I'll probably run bare.  Thank you so much for all your tips and tricks, I feel so much better!"
Surface,3blu35,oZiix,2,Tue Jun 30 23:38:22 2015 UTC,"No problem! Also worth noting is that the magnesium alloy chassis, gorilla glass screen, and solid state drive make for a very drop resistant device. I've dropped mine once and it suffered no damage or ill effects. Mine fell on carpet, and I wouldn't recommend testing that yourself, and certainly avoid dropping it on hard surfaces, but that just goes to show an extra case might not be necessary if you can tuck it into your purse."

Surface,3blu35,NoMoreIllusions,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:52:45 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks, I'm glad I figured that 2gb would NOT be enough. I like Comics! Do you have a recommended app? What's Kodi? Whta's AmiDuOs? Haha, I'm so out of the loop... thank you!"
Surface,3blu35,SourBuffalo,2,Tue Jun 30 09:06:06 2015 UTC,"AmiDuOs - Runs Android on top of Windows. Haven't tested it on a 4GB system. It's great on 16GB, but maybe too much for 2GB.  Kodi - New name for the old XBMC. Increasingly touch-friendly, and it supports hardware acceleration. Also works with damn near every codec, so it'll play any video you put on your drive.  Not sure about comic apps yet, the only one I've used so far was kinda meh. I might pull the trigger on Costco's Surface 3 bundle in a month or so. I'll update you then if I do =D  Oh also you might wanna install Steam if you have a gaming desktop; some newer graphics card stream video pretty darn quickly."

Surface,3blu35,JonSArt,2,Tue Jun 30 23:19:10 2015 UTC,"I've had mine about a month now, and an completely satisfied with it.  The ability to use it as a Tablet or a Laptop, in a very small (but not too small), lightweight package is perfect for my needs.  I have Photoshop CS6 on it, and it runs fine (my use is for photography) when I need it.  I use Chrome, and have had no problems with it at all.  I've watched Netflix shows on it without problem.  I've attached it to an HDTV to stream and watch the US Women's Soccer game against China.  I can attach my Seagate external HD and it works without problems.  I bought a USB 3.0 Hub (3 USB ports) which has an Ethernet passthrough, and it all works fine.  In short, it's handled everything I've thrown at it without a problem.  The SP3 would be more powerful, but the larger size makes it much less suitable as a Tablet in my opinion.  So, in terms of buyers remorse, I have none.  If I were buying another device today, I'd still pick the Surface 3."
Surface,3blu35,whozurdaddy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:39:33 2015 UTC,"That's very exciting, thank you! One of my concerns was that even though I rarely gamed on my laptop, I felt kind of sad that I wouldn't really have the OPTION on my S3. Have you had a lot of experience streaming in the other direction -- streaming via Steam? I have a beast of a desktop so that would solve that little concern."
Surface,3blu35,Dreadp1r4te,2,Tue Jun 30 11:25:15 2015 UTC,Glad it was helpful. I don't do any gaming at all so can't help you there.
Surface,3blu35,sheppe,2,Tue Jun 30 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"In home streaming works pretty great save a few hiccups in frame dropping. I've streamed gta v, witcher 2, and just cause 2 easy breezy. I guess it depends on your connection (both my pc and surface are WiFi) As far as gaming goes on the surface itself, it plays half life 2 extremely smooth. Any old game should work. You made a great choice. I've been nothing but happy with mine."
Surface,3blu35,sheppe,2,Tue Jun 30 19:28:08 2015 UTC,"So I'm not going to lie, I have remorse in some ways too. Primarily, my Surface was purchased when I really had no money for it, so I opened up a credit card to finance it. That makes it hard to not regret. My justification is that I've never owned a brand new computer, and I wanted a better form factor for school. It absolutely rules at school stuff. Annotating PDFs for class, simple programming. I use it to read NOOK on the train. The screen is absolutely wonderful.   Look, it's a tough price point. I want you to know you're not alone in justifying it. But after playing with it for a week, you'll start to realize what it excels at. It's the same reason people still pay $1200 for a MacBook; they're really light and extremely well made. The S3 may not last as long as other computers based on the processor alone, but unlike my old Asus laptop it won't have the display just shear off after 2 years of normal usage. It's tough, it's pretty, and the screen alone is worth the money versus competitors."

It definitely sounds like there's something wrong with your system, though. For starters, the system is meant to hibernate automatically after four hours of connected standby. And four hours on standby shouldn't come close to draining you to zero from 76%."

Surface,3blfqx,aafnp,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:31:51 2015 UTC,It looks like you were in connected standby for over two days. About fifty percent drain over that time period sounds about right (~1%/hr). You can try changing the setting so that it goes into hibernate after x hours of cs (sleep). Then you get the advantages of cs for shorter sleep sessions but no serious drain for long term sleep sessions.

Surface,3bm005,frank26080115,2,Tue Jun 30 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"They're probably getting rid of their inventory first. Although, if you're looking to get one, the question is more whether you need it now or not. Even if you got an SP3 now, it's not going to become obsolete just because the SP4 comes out later this year. If anything, the differences from the jump from the SP3 to the SP4 would be minor in comparison to the jump from SP2 to SP3.  You can always play the waiting game but if you must have the latest then consider getting the SP3 and waiting off for the SP5, depending on how often you'd like to upgrade."

So that means it's basically a solid 3 months away.  If you can wait that long I'd strongly advise to do so as it will most certainly be running the Skylake chipset.

Surface,3blio5,admronoc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:52:31 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - Surface 3 (not pro) isn't a slouch - but without the right bundle the price isn't that different from the low end Surface Pro 3.  Get what you can afford.  I bought the Surface 3 (not pro)  I am running some older games with Steam - Dawn of War for example - on the Surface 3 (not pro).  Settings are turned down but they play fine.  I tried one round of hearthstone and that ran fine.  http://www.tabletpcreview.com/feature/microsoft-surface-pro-3-vs-microsoft-surface-3/  FTA - Microsoft is claiming 80% performance of the i3.  For basic tasks and older games the Quad Atom seems to run fine - doesn't need a fan, and doesn't run that hot.  Google Surface Pro 3 heat or fan - there are several reports of the SP3 slowing down due to heat.  So even if you plan on running some heavy tasks - think about that as there may be better cooled laptops or desktops out there for the truly heavy tasks.  The other problem is actual usable space - the i3 comes with 64GB of drive space - which is 37GB free.  The Surface 3 128GB has 93GB free to start with.  Office is reporting around 2GB - Hearthstone was a 1GB - a few more games or apps and 37GB will fill quickly.  I did stick a 128GB SD card in - so my data files are mostly sitting there ~10GB from various cloud drives.  Point being - it doesn't take much to fill up that 37GB of the lowest level SP3.  I've had my Surface 3 for about a week - installed some basic programs - and I have most of my cloud data on the SD card - I am using ~42GB of 110GB and have 69GB free on the drive.  From this experience I would say the minimum you'd want to mess with on the SP3 side is a 128GB drive unless you know for a fact you aren't going to install many programs.  Remote 1080p videos from a local file server seem to play fine - but I am running an 802.11AC network.  I think 802.11N would probably work as well.  Streaming from Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime also seems to work fine.  I am using it also as a ""side device"" while playing xbox one.  It has smart glass which interacts with the xbox one.  I also use it with Chrome and Destiny Item Manager/Tower Ghosts while playing destiny - as well as look up stuff on the web and timer websites for destiny.  Works great for that application as well.  Bottom line with tech - get the most you can afford - it will last longer and run more software.  But the price/performance of the Surface is quite good for simple consumption and simple office tasks.  One of the calculations I did was go onto Amazon and look at a i3 with a typecover - it was around $880 USD.  The 4GB/128GB Surface 3 with Type Cover and Pen (i3 came with the Pen) was around $780 USD on Amazon.  For $100 it was hard to decide which to get.  Better processor and bigger more resolution screen - or a smaller lighter form factor with more Drive space.  Ultimately - I found a bundle deal at Costco - for $700 with pen and keyboard that pushed me to the Surface 3.  I think I found a refurbished deal - for a 128GB i5 - plus type cover to be around $980 - and a new 128GB i7 just released as well.  All the 128GB options plus type cover push upwards of $1000 - so again $700 was a much more attractive pricepoint for what I was planning to do (media consumption, light gaming, side device, office/outlook/onenote)"

Surface,3bjavq,shinyblots,7,Mon Jun 29 18:11:12 2015 UTC,"VirtualTablet in the Windows Store.  I tried it on my SP1, which has Wacom tech, but in its current state, it doesn't matter. It works, but it's limited by the fact that there is no Wintab support with the software (even if you have the wintab driver for your Surface installed). So applications with the InkAPI (like Photoshop CC) work, but wintab required applications (Photoshop CS6, Paint Tool SAI) don't have any pressure support."

I use the SP2 for my engineering work as I study, and it would be good for my friend who is currently working in the field and also do light gaming on; so I was thinking of selling it to him and just using the Surface 3 for all my engineering work (any heavy CAD work would be done on my secondary laptop).  It would have a slightly better pen (I say slightly as I've found a really good pen for the SP2 that is drop dead accurate), form factor for notes, still do light engineering work (some CAD software, office), lighter, and better battery.  But damn, the cheapest in Canada is $640 and I'm poor as can be.  Glad you like it.  The Surface line up is by far the best laptop/tablet concepts to date for all fields of work and average use.  Would be great to see Microsoft make a light-gaming tablet in the future and partner with AMD/Nvidia.  One can dream; a Surface Pro G 4, with an i5-5500 and GT940m would be fantastic in the old SP3 form factor and SP2 thickness."

Not enough to hold out for imho. We don't even know for sure the SP4 will be launched next month, there's also a good chance it will be released when Intel releases Skylake, which is september/oktoberish. And even then there's no guarantee they'll launch an SP4.   Looking at the sales of the SP3 they might not be in a rush to replace it. Even with the success of the SP3 they could screw it up. There's not much you can improve on it, maybe a slightly faster/cooler running CPU. Not gonna be noticeable anyway for most people. They already said it would be compatible with current accessories like the dock and keyboards so a larger screen is unlikely. USB Type C will be nice, but you're gonna want an adapter/hub anyway..."

While you don't get the fancy back and forward touch gestures like you do in Chrome, it scales better than Chrome, scrolls much smoother and most of all, much less impact on battery life and CPU.

Lap use has been mixed for me and I just prefer it on a table.  I had a SP2 before it and used it 100% without a monitor but the smaller 10.6"" 16:9 display annoyed me.

I've never had the urge to hook it up to an external monitor and in doing so I think defeats the purpose of owning this versatile machine.  Also using it on your lap is doable but the angle of the screen with the keyboard will be around 110 which is kinda steep
Surface,3bj6h3,Mtru6,2,Mon Jun 29 18:36:03 2015 UTC,I chose to buy a Surface 3 as a moveable machine/tablet.  I do have a 4k monitor that I bought that I am using it with - but I use it without the monitor a lot.  One of the downsides of the monitor is you lose the touch interface on that monitor.  One of the upsides is the 4k gives a lot of real estate when I need it.    I find the 1920x1280 to be quite good as far as stand alone goes.  I did set the Modern/Metro apps Display to smaller.  Charms -> Settings -> Change PC Settings -> PC and Devices -> Display -> More Options -> smaller Now the modern apps don't seem as gigantic.  Still touch friendly.  On the desktop side - Right Click -> Screen Resolution -> Make Text and other items larger or smaller -> and I slid the bar to the smallest settings.    I didn't find it to small for myself - but some of my older friends can no longer read at the smallest settings.  That slider bar affected the 4k monitor as well - but I have the 4k monitor quite close to me - so it works on that as well.  TL;DR - even the lower resolution Surface 3 - has a lot of screen real estate if you set it up correctly.

Surface,3bj1p5,ratshack,3,Mon Jun 29 18:28:10 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the Dell Stylus is or was a nightmare, improvements have been made through software but it is not nearly as good as the Surface pen.   The weight and size of the Dell is quite large, but the Dell comes with the option to have a battery in the keyboard, which can extend time in the field quite a bit.   For me the big fail for the Dell and the primary reason to go with the Surface is the screen. The Dell has the same resolution and aspect ratio as the Sp2, which is 1920x1080 and 16:9.   That is not a good res/ratio for a tablet, to cramped and narrow. The SP3 @ 2160x1440 and the S3 @ 1920x1280 is far more useful, this cannot be overstated really.   Anyway, I gotta go but that is my short list. The res is really a dealbreaker with the dell, cannot stress that enough."

The heat level from using these programs at the same time is minor. The heat level takes a while to get warm enough to turn the fan on, and the fan never gets to full speed. So... no proplems for me.  For the people that have had issues, I think they were doing more than just note taking... like games.  Certain things can ramp up the cpu and cause heat when it should not. The big one that everyone talks about is chrome. It would not be hard to cause the fans to ramp up during a lecture. For example, you could use a pdf viewer and Onenote, and decide to check a youtube video with Chrome, that could ramp up the fan.

I use a dual monitor supporting USB hub, pluggged in to the USB port on the surface hub, with my third monitor pluged in to the display port on the surface hub. this effectively gives me 3 external monitors on my surface, as simply as docking it with the surface hub."

More 4k explanation  http://techgage.com/news/ces-2013-so-what-exactly-is-4k-anyway/ Good picture of resolution comparison from the article http://techgage.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/4k_comparison.png  For Office/Outlook and PDF viewing it is great.

Surface,3bh644,MystK,2,Mon Jun 29 07:48:41 2015 UTC,The Surface Pro can use 3 displays. This can be 3 external monitors (using an MST hub) or 2 external monitors and the internal display.
Surface,3bh644,thw_,2,Mon Jun 29 08:59:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, upon further research the limits I wrote above are for connecting through the mini displayport. You can connect at least 1 additional monitor through USB as well."
Surface,3bh644,the_angel_moroni,2,Mon Jun 29 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"No.  The limit for the mini displayport (for the internal graphics card) is 3 monitors. You have one connector on the Surface Pro, with the dock you get a second.   Both mdp connectors can use a MST hub. This splits the mini displayport into 3 displayports. If you connect all 3, the internal display will get disabled.  USB monitors are separate from all that."
Surface,3bh644,thw_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:07:07 2015 UTC,"Fine, the limits I originally wrote are for the mini displayport assuming you want to keep the surface screen on. BTW you don't need the dock for the extra mini displayport, you can easily find MST docks with 3 outputs."

Also, I seriously might recommend if you plan on doing coding on a surface of any kind, you will need an external monitor due to the small text size inherent of a high resolution.   That being said, I'm running the i5 Surface Pro 3 4gb ram. For many of my projects I work on, I wish I had the 8gb or ram. The i5 works splendidly however. So, do yourself a favor, if you want a workhorse computer don't skimp on the SP3. It will amaze you in the capability in your every day work tasks."
Surface,3bgnj0,lohborn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:55:36 2015 UTC,In my time in the lab I never once ran a heavy computing job on my personal laptop.  I would always ssh into the department cluster. Even for a matlab project I would use one of the lab machines instead of my own.   I wouldn't worry about the surface not being powerful enough. It certainly is powerful enough to run the IDE to do the programming.  For any job that would take a while you wouldn't run it locally anyway.

I love the Sfc3. form factor is great, heat not an issue. haven't had any issues with media.

Surface,3bf48k,lonaysta,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:07:34 2015 UTC,what were your reasons for not keeping the s3?
Surface,3bf48k,hxkclan,2,Mon Jun 29 17:39:38 2015 UTC,"For me it was two things, the bigger screen estate and the extra oomph of the i5, I feel like in a few years the i5 and SSD will still be snappy compared to an eMMC memory with an Atom processor. Also breaking down the cost I was able to get a refurb i5 for $725 on Amazon which had almost a full year left on the MS warranty, and the keyboard used was only like $50. The 128GB S3 was $550 after a discount but getting a pen and keyboard would've been roughly $150 more. So it was $775 for the SP3 or $700 for the S3 it was a no-brainier for me personally.  And as it turned out that SP3 from Amazon had a fan issue, which MS swapped out for me now has warranty until August 2016, so it worked out well for me.  Now, had I planned on not using the pen and my own keyboard, or were it just being used casually? I would've been fine with the S3. And if you do buy it all new, then the SP3 would be significantly higher unless you took advantage of a discount.  Speaking of I just got an email from MS and they're having a 4 hour SP3 sale today."

Surface,3bjhf6,Juan_Deer,3,Mon Jun 29 20:15:49 2015 UTC,"Completely the opposite of my experiences with the MS stores.  I dropped my SP3 keyboard and busted out a couple of keys.  I mentioned this while buying something else at the MS store and they swapped it out with a new keyboard, no problem at all, even though it was my own fault.    I was in need of a 4A battery and visited the MS store, they don't sell them, but swapped out a fresh battery from a pen in stock.  No cost.  Amazing!  I'm not going to rant on my Apple experiences, but I will say they were not anywhere near as good as my MS customer service."
Surface,3bjhf6,nameofcat,4,Mon Jun 29 22:20:15 2015 UTC,"My 2011 MacBook Air, I had the same issue within the one year warranty.  They made me buy a new adapter saying it wasn't covered and then when there was a recall on the power adapter, they also conveniently said it wasn't covered."
Surface,3bjhf6,SmashedTX,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"How do you turn the charger on? If the computer was still under warranty I would insist on the charger being covered as well unless it was physically damaged.  Your experience is not a typical one, I would try again and if successful return the charger you bought. The microsoft store here bends over backwards to help out customers.  Wife had destroyed her windows phone, I brought in the biggest piece (left on the roof of car and had been run over MANY times) asked if it could be repaired.  They suggested I buy complete care and they would give me a new one.  Both Microsoft and Apple retail stores seem to offer great customer service."

I went in, and told them problem and tried to show them an example, but I couldn't get it to show. They understood, transferred my data, and let me walk out wi a new one. I continued to have this problem, so I did that exact process 3 other times, and they never charged me or anything. I never even had a warrenty.   I'm still having this problem, but I kinda figured it was just a problem with the iPad and gave up. I know that if I took it back to them, they'd give me a new one."

Surface,3bjhf6,ratshack,2,Tue Jun 30 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"I went to the store, I showed the employee a copy of my receipt for the purchase of the surface from their store. She brought over a surface and showed me the support website since I never registered my device with the microsoft support. We went through all the pages trying to get a replacement for the charger, and we got to a page that said this was not covered under warranty. Then the manager proceeded to try to get me to spend 150 dollars and get a 2 year warranty, and they would give me a charger. But I shouldn't have been spending any money at all, let alone another 150"
Surface,3bjhf6,ratshack,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"see that's the part that is wierd to me, the charger is certainly covered and if less than a year old and purchased from them it should have been handled right there, i would think.   Is it physically/visibly damaged? The only reason I can see for this to play out like this would be if it was obviously abused in a manner outside normal coverage."

Surface,3bg34y,Napoleon98,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:31:03 2015 UTC,"The atom nor the i3 would cry at such work loads, the major problem there would be RAM. For your major 8GB of RAM will be mandatory. The i5 will honestly handle any compiling comparably well in comparison to the i7, so much so that after some conditioning you will not notice the speed difference. The i7/128GB model released today so in all honesty the real question is how much space will you need? Assuming you have a desktop to handle your other gaming/media needs you can also offload some of the heavy programs to that desktop and you will not need the 256GB on the i5 version. You could also use onedrive, dropbox, an SD card a USB drive etc.. for extra stroage. So i say go and get the i7 128GB version. Prior to today the i5 would have been the absolute choice price/performance wise but it is no longer so."

Do you have a desk lamp nearby? Do you run florescence lighting close to your Surface?  Before you return it, try these first.   You can try turning off florescence light nearby, that is your desk lamp, or maybe move your Surface away from other powered devices. You can disable the pen input in driver, HID-compliant Pen or Surface pen or HID-complaint toucscreen (I can't remember which is the culprit) in Device Manager>Human Interface Devices.    See if the phantom clicks still occurs after trying those. It is very weird, I know. But try it and let me know if it work!"

They did this the last time the CEO wrote an email and people thought Satya wanted to shed the Surface line. They had to confirm they had a 4 so companies wouldn't shy away from their hardware investments. If they made a Surface 3 I guarantee you they're not throwing the towel in on a another Pro.

Surface,3bfnft,Waternut13134,2,Mon Jun 29 01:00:12 2015 UTC,"The i7 definitely gets hotter than the i5 under a heavy load, once the i7 gets to a certain temp it will throttle down its speed hence causing things to run slower,where's an i5 doesn't get as hot as the i7 so it may not have to throttle down and be able to run at full speed vs slower speed the i7 will run if it throttles down.   My opinion just go with the i5 model,it will be able to handle everything you are throwing at it with less of a chance at throttling.

I didn't have the SP3 back then, but for my hobbies and work now, which are all in that vein, I'm glad I went with the i7. This USB fan (http://www.amazon.com/ARCTIC-USB-Powered-Portable-Cooling-Solution/dp/B003XN24GY/) bent around to point at the back of the SP3 is silly but it actually works to cool the thing enough that games/rendering/etc. work like a charm without throttling (though they do throttle without any kind of external cooling). Putting the SP3 near my A/C vent also works to keep it from throttling. It's a real problem, but the workarounds are pretty easy. I've heard mixed reports about the i5 in comparison... some people say it does not throttle as much, but it seems clear that it can throttle too under heavy load, so it's not a complete solution to just go down to the i5.  You will enjoy whichever one you pick :-)"

I hope you didn't skip lunch JUST to record the video. One more quick question: Does the fan get that loud on a regular basis, or only when you do something really intensive? For example, I wouldn't want the fan to be that loud when I'm say, taking notes in a lecture, or using my Surface to draw while watching a movie. Thanks again!"

It definitely wouldn't come on during note taking in a lecture, but it might come on while drawing, depending on the software you use. If it does come on at odd times, there's got to be a reason and if you understand how to use Task Manager it isn't hard to track down what that reason is... which process or service process is working too hard."

The i7 is better at both. Both will throttle if you give them a long, heavy workload, but the i7 will still be faster and the throttling can be mitigated with extra cooling if needed.  With animation and video editing I'd suggest the i7. Don't forget the $1299 Core i7/128 GB/8 GB RAM version."

Don't worry about the screen size. The Pro 3 to me is far too big to properly take notes on. Surface 3  screen is more like a piece of loose leaf and it's aspect ratio reflects that. As for Chrome, well even if you buy a pro 3,  don't expect much. Chrome is known to be a battery and memory hog, so if you can't give Chrome up, I say go for a unit with 4 GB ram. For gaming, it's hard to answer that without any real specifics. Some people like r/Velarde in their latest post report positive gaming experience on the Surface 3.  But Again, even if you get a Pro 3 or a Surface 3, the Surface would probably overheat if the game is very cpu or graphics intensive.  If you ask me, The surface was never meant to be a gaming system. It's fine for the other stuff you listed there though.   This is all coming from a person who uses their entry line 2Gb ram surface 3 just for those other things you listed!

But, you want fairly cheap, and you have a laptop that can run those programs. Now, if those programs have to be ran during class, that's an issue on portability.  Considering your circumstances, I'd suggest a Surface 3 (not Pro) because you need a note taking device (which it's perfect for it). Not to mention, it's really cheap if you get the lowest model (which you'd just be taking notes on and reddit/movies/whatever) and it's lighter (though not much) than the other Surface models.  BUT, if you need to run those programs during class or wherever and need that portability of not bring the 'gaming laptop' with you, I'd suggest a Surface Pro 3. The only issue is that it's not cheap. In theory, it'd replace your gaming laptop fully (besides, you know, games) in the sense that it'd run those programs, but you may run into issues. (Don't quote me on this, I just own a SP3 i5 myself and it plays some heavy games and programs just fine) [Side note: Go for the i5, not i7. Throttling issues.]  So it comes down to... Do you want an all-in-one device for all your school needs, at the cost of expense? Or are you ok with lugging around your 'gaming laptop' for when you need to run the programs during class with another <2 pound device that fits all your note taking needs that is way cheaper.

So even if a CPU uses more energy than another, if it can finish work sooner and get into a low power state, you'll be saving power."
Surface,3bdtgt,Bagoole,2,Sun Jun 28 10:41:40 2015 UTC,"The impression I've gotten reading this sub since the SP3's release is that the i7 will thermal throttle faster than the i5 in a lot of cases, so in very demanding games so it's not necessarily better.  The improvements of HD5000 also aren't very spectacular compared to HD4000 series*.   The key for gaming or longer term heavy load work seems to be temperature control. Be it fans, doing your own throttling (Windows Power Options), underclocking a bit, or whatever gets it done.  *The Broadwell HD6000 stuff looks extremely promising, though, especially when combined with DX12. I haven't read much about the Skylake iGPUs, but I like to speculate the next Pro will be rocking Skylake."
Surface,3bdtgt,m0ny,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:49:57 2015 UTC,They could've used 1.5ghz core i5 with hd5000 graphics. Would've run cooler definately.
Surface,3bdtgt,m0ny,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:28:00 2015 UTC,Well they can use core i5 4360u which costs $150ish less but runs 200mhz slower (1.5ghz). lacks 1mb cache as well. And obviously less heat
Surface,3bdtgt,plus1zero,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:35:26 2015 UTC,Yeah but not much better. It'll throttle down quicker too
Surface,3bdtgt,scstraus,2,Sun Jun 28 22:34:15 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine anyone who needs that much CPU and RAM would be able to survive on that little disk. I've got a 64gb Windows 8 atom based tablet and it's a constant struggle to keep the disk from filling up. 128 is really the bare minimum for the OS, a few apps, and basic system files (email, etc). Trying to use the SD for file storage is harder than it seems because a lot of stuff won't recognize it (dropbox, etc). God knows I've tried. I use all sorts of special utilities to move off the email, apps, and dropbox to the SD and still manage to fill the disk constantly. My Windows folder alone is 40gb."
Surface,3bdtgt,Mettkrieger,4,Mon Jun 29 00:55:11 2015 UTC,Check this Link you should be able to put dropbox on your SD with this trick. Just tell Dropbox to save i.e. c:/sdcard/dropbox ;)
Surface,3bdtgt,scstraus,0,Sun Jun 28 12:56:27 2015 UTC,"Tried it, doesn't work. A better option is DropboxportableAHK but then you are beholden to the situation where every time Dropbox tries to screw that poor developer over and it stops working for a while. The only real solution is to get a bigger C: disk. I'm waiting for a 256gb Surface 3, then I'll upgrade."
Surface,3bdtgt,zz9plural,3,Sun Jun 28 13:25:55 2015 UTC,"Tried it, doesn't work.    You tried wrong. It does work. Used that trick on my new SP3 just yesterday."
Surface,3bdtgt,scstraus,0,Sun Jun 28 15:06:10 2015 UTC,It works for a while but then after a while the folder mysteriously ends up empty and you have to redo the whole process again. And you can never eject the SD card.
Surface,3bdtgt,zz9plural,3,Sun Jun 28 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"I'll see. Have done the same thing on other devices (even ran World Of Tanks from SD on a SP2 for quite a while) and never encountered that problem or any other glitch - maybe your SD card was faulty. And yes, you can eject the SD card just fine, but you shoudn't do it while Dropbox is syncing."
Surface,3bdtgt,scstraus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:58:41 2015 UTC,"All in all, dropbox portable ahk is a better solution for me. I can remove the card, only run it when I want, etc. But I will move it to internal storage as soon as I can. Dropbox is pretty picky. I could see doing that for some apps though. Generally it's possible to install them on the SD without such trickery though. A couple registry changes will change the default for all windows store apps, and normal installer apps will usually let you change the disk they install on."
Surface,3bdtgt,buddybd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:07:44 2015 UTC,I'd be fine with the 128GB. I have a separate setup at home and my mobile needs are not that much. I currently have the i3 and it feels sluggish often.
Surface,3bdtgt,scstraus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"Yes 128gb is doable if you have minimal needs (no personal files which you need to store on the HDD, no large apps), but it's cramped. Hell, I'm making do with 64gb but it sucks. i3's can also be sluggish, agreed. I think the sweet spot is i5/256gb for most people."
Surface,3bdtgt,kol13190,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:10:01 2015 UTC,Thank you for saying it. 128GB is the literally about as minor as you can get with the smallest amount of breathing room. 64GB is worse considering after all the updates and packages you're left wiT about 10-15 of free space

The device is a bit pricy for what it is right now. Competing product are on Broadwell, the Surface Pro needs the touch cover at an 150$ extra...  A SP4 at Skylake launch seams like the most probably scenario but I like to think Microsoft could slowly be coming to an Apple mode of operation where the internals can change twice a year but the case doesn't change much for a few years."

Surface,3bdtgt,scstraus,2,Sun Jun 28 18:17:18 2015 UTC,The workaround for the 128GB version is to simply add a 128GB microSD card and viola you have a Surface with 256GB of storage for hundreds of $$$ less.

It needs to be a wide plug to prevent it from rocking about excessively, so that does make it harder to grip in order to pull it out. The gap on the bottom edge helps."

Surface,3bf4ou,Silversee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:07:29 2015 UTC,The touchcover in my eyes is just a screen cover that conveniently has a keyboard on it.  The touch cover is a crappy keyboard but is great as a cover for the surface. It would have sold better if it were cheaper but R&D and production costs inhibit selling at a low marketable price point. It would have sold better if it was sold at a price that made it a 'screen cover' rather than a full blown keyboard. Of course the cost of producing the touch cover makes that impossible.

The only real deal I'm aware of on the Surface 3 is the Costco bundle.  That saves you $78 vs. buying the keyboard and pen separately.  And Costco's pretty good about returns and exchanges, though they do have a time limit on that (they didn't used to -- you could take a 2 or 3 year TV in, say you no longer want it, and exchange it for a new one; it's obvious why they changed that policy for certain items and especially electronics).  Surface Pro 3s are cheaper on Amazon for $1-200 depending on model, but none of those are sold directly by Amazon.  They're all ""Sold by XXX and Fulfilled by Amazon"", which means that whoever the seller is sent their inventory into Amazon to manage shipping but the origination of that inventory is unknown.  I generally avoid anything that's not listed as ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"", because anything other than that means it's some random reseller of unknown trustworthiness.  I certainly wouldn't buy something as expensive as an SP3 from such a seller."

Surface,3bbxfn,blackhawkdown58,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"The whole Retina thing is the reason I'm not a big fan of Apple displays.  I wish they would just call it 4K or 2K or 1080p.  I expect no less of the Surface 3's resolution being no less than stunning.  At that size, 1080p is perfect.  I think that 2K is better for it, which is why I like the SP3 more.  But I am glad to see that manufacturers are going towards a smaller screen but a higher resolution, I can barely look at a TV bigger than 18"" that has a 1080p screen.  It was cool back when they first came out, but if the screen is too big, then it starts to loose some of the reality of it."

So I got to choose a new color and got a brand new unit...all without even verifying my phone was defective. Oh yea... And they offered me a bottle water or soda while I waited for the data migration.
Surface,3bbxfn,SupperTime,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:24:03 2015 UTC,The reason I buy from there is because I bought a headset for my Xbox there and their Lumia checkout thing wasn't working so they took down my email and said if my transaction didn't go through they would contact me so I could come back and they could charge me for them.

The SP3 is the best device I've owned.  Its extremely powerful and versatile, yet thin and light.    Removable keyboard, touch screen, and pen make it better than my macbook.

The S3's eMMC storage can get very slow if overloaded, and may cause what looks like a freeze but is actually just a really long wait queue for IO that should resolve itself given enough time.

Surface,3bf4s2,easyxtarget,2,Sun Jun 28 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"No. Complete on any Surface or Surface Pro model does not entitle you to upgrades. Your Complete coverage includes same-model exchanges from warranty stock, which is either new or refurbished.    You may have gotten upgraded when you visited the store, but it's important to understand that this is not within the terms of Complete, is not guaranteed or entitled, and should not be expected.  You can go to a Microsoft Store and ask about the Recycle for Rewards program, which will let you get the recycle (not resale) value of your device in store credit. Your device has to be in working condition.    In most cases you can get more money reselling your device separately (e.g. Craigslist or eBay). The upside of the option at the Microsoft Store is that you get money for your stuff immediately and without any hassles."

Surface,3bf8iy,MooseKnocker,3,Sun Jun 28 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"Both use regular Windows. The Pro has a larger screen and is an over all stronger machine (CPU, RAM, storage). To put it simply, the Pro is closer to a laptop where as the base Surface is closer to a tablet.  What kind of sketching do you do? Depending on your style, the basic surface might get the job done. If you plan on working on very large images with many layers in Photoshop, the Pro seems like the way to go. Keep in mind that screen size will have an impact on sketching. The Pro is 12"", the size of a sheet of letter/A4 paper where as the standard one is 10"". Also, the pen is a 50$ add on for the Surface  3 that comes included with the Surface Pro 3.   IMHO, the base surface 3 is too underpowered. 2GB of ram will be very limiting (though very possibly enough for you, depending on your use). The upgraded model is too expensive for what it is. In Canada, it's 100$ cheaper than the base Surface Pro 3. Once you factor in the 50$ pen, the 50$ upgrade for a larger screen/faster machine seems like a no brainer - especially if you'll be sketching on this machine."

Surface,3bf8iy,Silversee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"Some critical comments here from people who sound like they might not be actual owners...   Read the reviews, talk to actual owners, play with one of possible, then make up your own mind. Because of its smaller form factor, lighter weight and fanless operation, I think the S3 is a better tablet than a Pro, and it's performance as a laptop is sufficient for the way most people use a computer.   It's an Atom, but it uses the new X7 quad-core CPU with Core graphics that is at the top end of Intel's current range for tablet SOC's. It's not as fast as the SP3, but it almost never throttles and overall performs well for a $500-600 device.  If performance is more important to you than size, weight and price, them of course the Pro 3 is terrific.  Whichever one you choose, both run full Windows, and can be upgraded to Windows 10 for free."

The ""final"" build will come to everyone at the same time; you can then choose whether you want to continue to receive Insider builds post-launch (the program doesn't end).  That said, what you describe can be easily fixed by adjusting the UI scaling. There are two settings: one for Metro, and one for the desktop. Adjust the size of the Metro UI from Display section of PC Settings; to adjust desktop scaling, navigate to Display in the desktop Control Panel, make sure ""Let me choose one scaling level for all my displays"" is NOT checked, then adjust the slider to achieve the effect you want. The default is ""Larger"" I believe, which should be 150%. All Surface devices other than the original Surface RT look best at this setting.  Not all Windows desktop apps respect the desktop scaling settings, but many do. Those that don't will NOT be fixed by Windows 10; that's something the developer will have to program for, so there is not particular benefit to Windows 10 for this reason alone.  Lastly, the current build, 10130, still has significant issues.  I would personally wait a month..."
Surface,3berv5,Silversee,2,Sun Jun 28 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"OP, know that if you go this route and you format your current Windows 8.1 install, you will have to pay to get the final version of Windows 10 unless you're fine with forever being on preview builds. The only way to get Windows 10 for free is to upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, or to stay in the Insider program and receive preview updates (which might not be the best thing for stability of your system, but would likely be fine if your SP3 isn't something you need to rely on). If I were you, I'd just wait. It's only a month."

Also, nothing is irreversible. Even if he did somehow mess up his device, Microsoft has full ISO images for Surface that anyone can download and install if they need to restore their machine to Windows 8.1 factory settings. The product key is tied to the hardware. In the case, at worst, he'd need to reset to Windows 8.1 before applying the free upgrade, but in no case would he be required to pay for it (unless he wanted to).  Not directed specifically at you, but why do people seem to think Microsoft is out to screw them in this?  They are offering a free copy of Windows to something close to a billion people for a reason: because they want everyone on Widows 10 to win over developers . It will be really easy to get the update, and they will be generous with edge cases."

Surface,3bcb9h,a_futurehead,4,Sat Jun 27 21:29:20 2015 UTC,"I personally dislike the fact that the battery is not user replaceable. If the battery dies, or the fan dies, it means that the Surface dies with it. You will need to spend extra cash after warranty to send it in for repair.  The battery is expected to last for 4.5 years according to http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26m9cu/we_are_panos_panay_and_the_surface_team_at/chsd6cs. If it spoils within warranty (1 year or 2 years if you get complete), you can get a free replacement.  You can get a Surface which is a laptop + a tablet combo for 4.5 years (fingers crossed). After that, you may need to keep it always plugged into the mains. And keep in mind if it goes kaput after warranty, you have to fork out extra cash to send it back to Microsoft for repair.  Or you can get an iPad which can last really long. My family is still using a first generation iPad (5 years and counting). The battery life is still decent. But we are using it for very simple entertainment tasks.  Or you can get a high end ultrabook which will have similar warranty. But it is definitely going to more easily serviceable by 3rd party and with parts more readily available as well. My old Toshiba laptop lasted me about 4 to 5 years.

Surface,3bcb9h,PeloyGeek,6,Sun Jun 28 01:58:57 2015 UTC,"If it's battery life you're worried about I have a 128gb Surface pro from a month after launch and the battery still last about as long as it did when I first got it. The first series type keyboard is still in great condition. I use it as my netflix / last night work machine, so I probably drain it to about 50% every night. I'd say the battery could be a problem a couple years down the line but around then it's time for an upgrade anyways and could be put to full time desk duty. The Surface over laptop thing I will say is at work we have a laptop and a Surface that we use and 1 day we had fire sprinklers go off over night. It totally ruined the laptop but the Surface all we had to do is replace the keyboard."
Surface,3bcb9h,earn54,2,Sat Jun 27 21:58:58 2015 UTC,What's your replacement cycle. Surely you don't expect someone to keep using the same computer/surface for more than 3 years without an upgrade to new hardware. I assume your asking about the Surface Pro 3 and not the Surface 3.
Surface,3bcb9h,jdmulloy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:16:53 2015 UTC,"Disclosure: I'm an attorney with some tech knowledge but I'm not an IT professional by any means.   Our office has been using iPad 2's for several years (apparently - I only came in a year ago).  We want to replace them with a mix of Surface threes and pro threes. Our users only do documents, email (both in 365), and PDF editing locally. Almost everything else is cloud based (e discovery, case management system, etc.). So outlook and nitro PDF are the only resource hogs (other than chrome), and as far as I can tell they perform well on a regular surface three.   Does the cycle length depend on the device? I'd hope that these could last as long as their useful life, as our apps don't seem to be evolving to use more resources, but rather less as we move more and more into the cloud."
Surface,3bcb9h,DrScience2000,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:33:51 2015 UTC,"I am an IT professional, I use my SP3 for work.  I've had it since launch day and have had no issues with the battery.  I have MS Complete which covers any issues for 2 years since Complete was turned on.  For $50, MS will just give me a new device hassle free, if anything goes wrong.  According to accountants, all computer hardware depreciates to zero within three years.  Computer hardware three years old or older technically has no value.  I've heard that business can get something from MS that is more than MS Complete that will cover the device for 3 years.  I don't know the details, and I'd contact an MS sales rep for that info.  Anyway, I wouldn't worry about the battery life.  I'd get MS Complete or that business one if available and not too expensive and just not worry.  In 2-3 years time its likely your business will want to upgrade some hardware again anyway."

If you want to use your finger as a mouse with a keyboard attached it can become very annoying to have the keyboard constantly popping up when ever you touch your screen (ONENOTE App I'm looking at you).  With the switch to Windows 10 having the keyboard pop up when you touch a text box only in continuum is much better. That said a program still has to be programed such that the Windows OS actually recognizes the UI element as a text box.  Until then, surf with the Modern version of IE. If you have another browser set as the default note the Modern version disappears. You have to set IE as the default web browser to essentially get it back."

I feel like a jackass now but I'll leave my comment up in case anyone is trying to use the SP3 to stream. On that note, I've been using 8Stream to watch source quality on Twitch with my CPU capped at 70%.  ----------original comment below----------  I've been streaming from the Surface Pro 3 for about a month now, so here's my experience.  I stream my console games from my SP3 using an AverMedia ExtremeCap U3 and I'm overall pleased with the performance; HOWEVER, it will not work straight out of the box if you want a decent quality stream. As we all know, the SP3 thermal throttles super hard and streaming through OBS is one of the easiest way to hit that thermal limit. In order to get around that, I use a USB fan, pointed at the intake in the top right corner of the SP3 to keep my CPU under the throttling limit.

If you set ANY other browser than IE as your default, then you can't use the Metro/Modern IE App. It's a shame because I really like using Metro IE over Chrome when I'm not docked and using my SP3 as a tablet.  If you do have IE as your default browser, go to Internet Settings and there you should have an option to always use Tablet mode, alwas use Desktop mode, and a third option to let IE choose wich mode to use.  I can't wait for W10 with the Edge browser. IE Desktop lacks proper touchscreen controls, and is barely usable without a mouse.

Surface,3b8jmw,intended_result,3,Fri Jun 26 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"If your mother only does light tasks such as IE, emails and entertainment. Surface 3 should be fine. Your the only one who will notice its lower end points, not her."
Surface,3b8jmw,lespy_laz,2,Fri Jun 26 21:57:40 2015 UTC,What sort of stuff do you do with your computer? It's hard to recommend without knowing typical use for you.   If you are not having any problems with the Surface 3 then I would stick with it.  If you would like to future proof a bit so you can use it for a few years then you might want to pay the extra $100 to get the 4GB version. You will have a better time multitasking in the future.
Surface,3b8jmw,lohborn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest, I left out some info to simplify the question and youre correct to ask what i intend to use it for. The answer is.. nothing. Its actually for my mother. From my own point of view and user needs (3d artist, photographer, video etc), I would need the fastest Surface Pro model. My mother clearly does not but I feel from my own pov as someone who uses insanely fast 6 core, 8 cores, and xeons... the surface 3 is a little slower than maybe i would be comfortable with her spending her money on. I'm not sure if this is my own user needs getting in the way of my judgement or not so i left this info out of my question. For her its really about cost and simple user needs. Your typical facebook, upload pictures, browse, play scrabble. Shes barely knows how to use a computer so on one hand the surface 3 is perfect for her. Its light, small, great device in general and a good price. But from my POV, eh it could be a bit faster, even for her uses. I'm impressed that it can run photoshop, brush strokes are responsive enough but again for my needs, it wouldnt cut it. Chrome doesnt run the best on it, but it runs better than firefox (very choppy). IE is amazing on it and maybe thats all she would need.   She has about another 15 days to decide. I like the device, but to me its more tablet than laptop in terms of power but it is one hell of a machine compared the samsung tablet she just destroyed by dropping it on its screen :)  Since it comes down to price, i'm wondering if the price for performance is worth it in the lower end pro models compared to the 3. Otherwise I'll feel ok telling her to keep the surface 3. Im a bit worried that the atom based machines arent as fast as other chips and lack real SSD... and may not perform well in the near future."
Surface,3b8jmw,lohborn,2,Fri Jun 26 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"I would say she would be fine with the Surface 3 (and probably fine with a cheaper device that is a generation older)  Regular stuff like facebook and scrabble will never tax it.  If you want it to feel a bit more responsive use IE instead of chrome.    I wouldn't even bother getting the higher end Surface 3. I have an older Asus T100ta that I use as my main device.  It runs pretty well.  I use photoshop, create vector graphics, do light 3d modeling and rendering, and mobile app development on it regularly. I might lose 10-20 in total all day waiting for stuff to open because it's lacking SSD and batch processing/3D rendering is pretty slow but none of that will matter at all for your mom."

There's a file explorer app for metro, which seems pretty cool, and allows you to easily access drive c.    If you're going to take notes at all, be sure to put one note on all your devices, as the notebooks sync automatically.    The default mail app sucks for me, and stopped working, so I switched to another app.    All together very pleasant experience with it."

Surface,3b979y,supersoviettaco,2,Sat Jun 27 00:21:13 2015 UTC,"You may not be able to get a perfect solution, simply because it's a TV, not a monitor. The problem is you have to deal with the TV's electronics, not the LCD panel itself, so while it's a 1366x768 panel by the specs I see, it may not even accept that resolution as an input. Monitors are designed to prefer input at their native resolution and show every pixel, one-for-one (though they will scale also). TVs are designed to prefer standard broadcast resolutions (480i/p, 720p, 1080i/p), often cut a little off the edges (overscan), and scale it to fit the screen. Some TVs offer a dot-for-dot mode that essentially disables any scaling, but it is uncommon, especially on cheaper TVs. Other times one of the scaling modes will suffice as long as you're feeding it the native resolution. Sometimes nothing will get you dot-for-dot. When watching TV, movies, or games, you usually don't notice these things, they are done for valid reasons, but put a desktop on them and you will immediately notice if it is cut off or the text isn't sharp.  Every HDMI display has an EDID, which is a table that tells the source device what it supports: 3D or not, what kind of audio, deep color etc, and relevant to this discussion, resolutions. As I said before a monitor will prefer it's native resolution, but your TV might list 720p as the preferred resolution because that is the TV standard closest to its panel resolution. It may not even list the true native resolution as an option, because it's not one used in broadcasting.  You may need to add a custom resolution on the Surface to enable it to output 1366x768. I can't tell you exactly how as I haven't had to, but it shouldn't be too hard to find. May require switching to stock Intel drivers. Even doing that may not allow you to select it though if the TV's EDID doesn't include it as described above. In that case 720p is probably the best you're going to get with that particular TV.  I just flipped through the manual for the model you listed. It does mention a dot-for-dot mode, but only for ""PC Input"" which I think they mean to be just the VGA, not HDMI. The diagrams for HDMI hookup mention that it only accepts 480i/p, 720p, and 1080i signals. For VGA it says it will accept wide resolutions of 1280x768 or 1360x768. If you're set on using this TV, you'll probably have better luck with VGA than HDMI, even though I'd generally recommend the opposite."

After a couple years in use, there was a chance that the gel would leak out and cause air bubbles too. The gel is insanely sticky too.

Surface,3b66sp,celticchrys,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:01:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you for reminding me of this difference between LCD and OLED function. Here is another possible solution to the problem, without an external display, but I haven't tried it.  http://www.lovemysurface.net/turn-off-the-screen-on-surface-tablets/ Here is another app attempting to solve the same issue, which I also have not used. http://www.redmondpie.com/turn-off-your-notebook-lcd-with-one-click/"
Surface,3b66sp,peatcoal,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"I've tried both those - the only way that you can get a program that will turn off the screen on a normal PC to turn off the screen on the SP3 (and I assume other Surfaces) is to enable Hyper-V, i.e. turn off connected standby and replace it with hibernate only. This is an unacceptable compromise for me (reducing the portability by a huge amount) but might be a good solution for some people."
Surface,3b66sp,Liam2349,2,Sat Jun 27 23:57:21 2015 UTC,The temperature increase from charging it constantly will cause the battery to wear faster.
Surface,3b66sp,zz9plural,2,Fri Jun 26 14:11:47 2015 UTC,With modern BMS (< ~5 years) this shouldn't be an issue anymore.
Surface,3b66sp,Liam2349,0,Fri Jun 26 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"Depends how long you intend to keep the device. At 5 years the SP3 is supposed to be at 80% capacity, which wouldn't be enough for me, but I don't plan to keep it anywhere near that long so I don't worry about it."
Surface,3b66sp,zz9plural,2,Fri Jun 26 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't make myself clear: modern BMS should not keep charging fast beyond 90% capacity if connected to power for more than 1 hour after reaching 80%. And most of them don't. The main temperature issue occurs way below 80%, as most BMS tend to charge too fast in that phase (because we customers need that thing charged as fast as possible).  Edit: added ""fast"" to make first sentence accurate."

Don't have battery issues.  I do, after a few years post release, have a heat issue though.  To power the monitors it appears the SP1 generally heats up a lot.  This heat is leading to the glue weakening.  I'm seeing the screen separating from the body slowly.  Thinking of waiting till it splits completely then maybe upgrade the SSD if prices are low enough."
Surface,3b66sp,psyche77,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:43:00 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I run one of my monitors off a Plugable USB hub so that may be the difference.  The Surface itself stays cuddly warm.

Surface,3b65rx,Fuckyousantorum,5,Fri Jun 26 07:56:02 2015 UTC,"I just recently started using the S3 for work, primarily to move toward going paperless.  Your conundrum is the same as mine -- when working with physical documents, it is easy to manipulate the paper, look at one documents while writing notes on a pad, etc.  When using the S3 as a paper-replacement device, you are really only replacing a single document at a time.  HOWEVER, I've noticed that when I'm taking notes related to a PDF document, even with physical paper your focus is only on one document at a time.  I've found myself using one note and drawboard, and going back and forth very quickly by pulling in from the left side of the screen.  It is so fast that it is analogous to changing your focus on individual documents.  The other thing I tend to do is double tap on the s pen and screenshot a portion of the PDF that requires constant reference.  For example, if I'm reading a case (I'm a lawyer), usually it is stored as PDF and I write directly on it.  However, if there is a quote that I want to take notes on, I'll clip that paragraph directly into onenote so it is there with my notes.  This is actually better than my paper workflow, which involved reading paper cases and highlighting, then copying and pasting into a word document after reading.  Any lawyers reading this will note that the only flaw in this approach is storing a pinpoint citation for the quote, but I usually just leave that until later -- I can get a pin cite in Westlaw using CTRL-F so fast that it doesn't materially affect my drafting.  The last thing that I'll say (and I'm still relatively new to building these workflows) is that sometimes going entirely paperless is more trouble than its worth.  If I'm in a meeting and there is some physical document that has been distributed, I can take notes in onenote and on the physical copy, then scan the physical copy into my drive for later use.  I know this is wasteful, but you'd have to burn through tens of thousands of sheets of paper before it would outweigh the cost and environmental impact of another device (as you proposed in your two device solution).  I'm lucky to have access to efficient sheet-fed scanners, so getting physical documents into my workflow is a non-issue.  If I had to take use my phone or a single sheet scanner to get the documents in, that would definitely hamper my workflow."
Surface,3b65rx,flyingfallous,4,Fri Jun 26 13:55:40 2015 UTC,"I sometimes also just use the camera to take a snapshot of any paper I've made notes on at the end of a meeting. I can take the snapshot, using the camera, directly into my OneNote page about that meeting. OneNote will scan it after syncing and make it searchable.  This also works well on my work Samsung Galaxy Note 8 tablet, which I also sometimes take meeting notes on."
Surface,3b65rx,celticchrys,2,Fri Jun 26 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"THIS, right here, is why I think I'm going to go with a surface. I really can't eliminate all paper, and I""m a doodler, etc.. but I just really desperately need searchable notes, to be able to write directly on PDF files without printing out 1400 damn pages, etc. I think I'll end up with a surface and a moleskine and that's it. I would be so happy. And I am getting better to remember to take pictures of EVERYTHING - receipts, handwritten notes, etc. Has saved my ass. I kept forgetting camera = scanner!"
Surface,3b65rx,skintwo,5,Mon Jun 29 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"hmm, that's a bit tricky. Fiddling with computer is a no-no, but having two tablets on the lap (or on the table in front of you?) would be ok? Are the other participants writing on a piece of paper and/or read from a piece of paper? Do you WANT to stand out? Then the 2 tablet overkill would accomplish that I think. From my point of view the dude who has two screens in front of him and is supposed to listen to the other participants would look a bit overwhelmed and maybe won't be taken 100% serious.  But that also depends on how techie the whole environment is :)"
Surface,3b65rx,rimsmasher,2,Fri Jun 26 09:40:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. That's really helpful. I really want to go paperless but I don't think I can because of this or I may just have to master the sp3. I would say half have ipads but they don't take notes.  My other colleagues seem to get by with ipad minis but again I am the most copious note taker.
Surface,3b65rx,SirScarballs,4,Fri Jun 26 09:48:58 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude or anything, but I would support your statement to ""master the SP3"". It took me a while to really set everything up the way I want and adopt my workflow to working only digital. I had my SP3 for nearly a year now and I hardly ever feel limited when taking notes/reading/annotating/presenting, not even when doing several of these at once.  Analyze where exactly it is your workflow has its problems and try to come up with strategies to solve them. Then try them and either adopt or improve again if it doesn't change to the better.  I would never want to go back to back to paper now that I made it into the digital world. So many advantages.  In regards to your problem: why don't you import the needed PDFs into onenote?"
Surface,3b65rx,rimsmasher,3,Fri Jun 26 10:40:00 2015 UTC,"I only have a Surface RT without a pen, so I can't judge how difficult it is to write on a SP3 without triggering unwanted things like with your palm or something like that, but I really enjoy the split-screen function even on my good old RT (browsing / twitch stream at the same time woohoo ;) ), so your setup is generally PERFECT for the capabilities of the SP3. I imagine the 3:2 screen ratio to be pretty good for reading on the left 1/3 to a half and taking notes on the right ~half of the screen.  so yeah, I would also encourage you to tame the split screen beast ;)"
Surface,3b65rx,alpinelarch,2,Fri Jun 26 11:26:41 2015 UTC,"I would often hit the windows capacitive button by mistake, so I flipped the SP3 upside down. That helped a bit with that problem. :)"

Does it look odd at times? Have people given me strange looks? Yes to both...  Edit:  Just looked up the spec sheet for the linx 8...

Surface,3b6f4d,hxkclan,3,Fri Jun 26 11:14:54 2015 UTC,I use Modern IE with hosts file ad blocking and it works really well on my SP3. I do miss plug-ins like RES but for everything else it's very nice. I've also become a fan of Foxit Reader for PDFs. I use it and the Modern reader about 50/50 but with Foxit registered to handle PDFs I'll actually get content previews in Explorer. 7-Zip for compression is also a bit more useful than the native Explorer Zip support.   I don't think I can recommend Ninite enough. You select applications to install and it fetches them from their original locations and installs them for you. It also automatically de-selects and toolbar/adware options the installers might have. Every time you run your custom installer it will update the installed applications. I have an installer on my OneDrive root so I can just run it and be fully up to date on my selected applications.

It is slower than the i5 of course, but it is not slow at all. It is very comfortable for taking notes and the battery lasts longer. It doesn't get warm at all, and overall I enjoy better its lightness and small footprint.  The quality control of Microsoft on refurbished devices is unacceptable. I had 3 very bad experiences with my former SP3.  My original device had a cracking and wobbling kickstand. Something very ""unhealthy"". I went through an advanced exchange. The replacement device came with a terrible mark under the screen, but a perfect kickstand. The second replacement device came with a perfect kickstand and a perfect screen, that was totally popped-out. I was able to insert my credit card in between the screen and the frame.  I waited 3 months and took advantage of a professional trip to go to a Microsoft store in Toronto. Meanwhile, the gap between the screen and the frame collected a lot of dust. The (very nice) guy at the MS store was shocked, and got me a brand new one. This device was finally great but after all this, I was pissed-off and I had already decided to sell the brand new SP3 the day after and get a S3 in return.  I dont regret it at all. Not even 1 second.  Go for the brand new S3."

Surface,3b21nm,Mysqu,8,Thu Jun 25 09:45:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's my wish list.   I don't really give a toss about content creation and management. If I wanted that, I'd go to the website version, but that's just my opinion.   Before it went unsupported, I used Hyper. It wasn't the prettiest app, but I liked it because it was easy to add videos to playlists, and you could download videos for offline viewing. However, it couldn't play 60 fps, which is not the worst thing ever, but notable. Additionally, annotations didn't work at all, and comments were kind of janky.   Right now I use TubeCast. It looks great, and plays 60 fps video, but it is finicky as hell to use. It's hard to navigate, and closing videos takes far longer than it should (in Hyper, you swiped the video, whilst in TubeCast, you long press). Adding videos to playlists is a chore, and preloading doesn't work at all, at least on the free version.   So basically, I'm looking for the functionality of Hyper, with the looks of TubeCast.   Thank you for listning! I'm looking forward to seeing what this app will look like!"

If it would be at all possible to replicate the brilliant implementation from those platforms, where you can drag the video down to the right-hand corner, and have it play as a small miniature while you do other stuff, and simply being able to dismiss it by pushing it out to the left... that would be fantastic.  I am a Developer myself, so if you were to publish the Source code early, I would hopefully be able to help :)"

Surface,3b21nm,vinscuzzy,3,Fri Jun 26 00:29:48 2015 UTC,"I was also an avid Hyper user. It went off the market because Google changed the YouTube API, breaking this and other YouTube apps. But I'm now trying the Hyper beta, which is good, but not as good as the original app, in my opinion. I'm not sure what kind of limits the new API imposes, but here's my most used features:   Ability to see most popular/trending YouTube videos. Bonus points: list of daily top 20 YouTube videos from Reddit's /r/Videos Ability to see ratings (percentage of likes) on videos, before clicking them. I hate wasting time on click bait or bad videos. I usually don't watch a video if it has less than 60% likes.  Ability to ""cast"" videos via DLNA (the ""play to"" feature), just like most existing YouTube apps were able to do. Ability to manually change viewing resolution. This is essential when using mobile tethering to save data.  Ability to add videos to playlists, subscribe to channels, etc... Most recent uploads across all the channels I subscribe to.  Ability to download videos in different resolutions (360/480/720/1080 etc...). I typically download a ton of YouTube videos and then watch them on a flight or during road trips with my kids. Hyper should have this feature in their new app, I believe. Also the ability to download just the .mp3 of videos.    Many more, but those are the essentials! Looking forward to your app."

Surface,3b2474,brainandforce,-2,Fri Jun 26 06:07:38 2015 UTC,"Good catch, but backlights never appealed to me. Eventually you'll have the important keys memorized and will be able to type in the darkest of rooms. It's similar to how you can navigate around your own house if you were blindfolded, or write without looking down - at least this is how I see it."
Surface,3b2474,T_GTX,3,Thu Jun 25 12:17:24 2015 UTC,Or don't see it...  Amiright?
Surface,3b1r99,mwiz13,10,Thu Jun 25 07:13:38 2015 UTC,"ASRock has a video driver that works.  Version 10.18.14.4214 includes valid entries for the Cherry Trail video chipset, hardware ID 22B0, included in the Surface 3  Look for the VGA entry at the bottom of the list   http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/N3050B-ITX/index.us.asp?cat=Download&os=Win8a64  You'll have to use the device manager to do a manual install and point it at the .inf file in the Graphics folder.  I've had it installed for a few days and haven't noticed any issues."
Surface,3b1r99,NoAirBanding,3,Thu Jun 25 13:15:59 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I needed! Thank you so much! For those who want to do this, after you install the above:  1) Open up Intel Graphics Control Panel by going to the Desktop, right clicking and selecting ""Graphics Properties""  2) Now click ""Video"". Then there's a drop down in the top left: change it to ""Image Enhancement"" and then Disable ""Contrast Enhancement"" and then apply.  3) Go back and then click ""Power"" and Disable ""Display Power Saving Technology"".   This should take away the annoying ""flickering"". Hooray!"
Surface,3b1r99,cbono360,2,Fri Jun 26 03:32:18 2015 UTC,Yes!!! Thanks guys!
Surface,3b1r99,PeripheralMediocrity,2,Fri Jun 26 03:46:50 2015 UTC,"I think this is what you want:  http://www.surfaceforums.net/threads/surface-tweak-tool-for-surface-pro-2-release.8219/  Works fine on Pro 3, not sure about Surface 3 though"
Surface,3b1r99,reddoorcubscout,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:06:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, I tried this, but the options are not available to switch on. =/"
Surface,3b1r99,surek,2,Fri Jun 26 02:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yes! Same thing happens with me, been trying to find a fix.  Thanks."
Surface,3b1r99,T_GTX,2,Thu Jun 25 20:56:43 2015 UTC,"I've been looking for a fix for this, as the auto dim drives me crazy. Basically makes it impossible to watch videos.   Still not seen a solution anywhere :("
Surface,3b4c0i,TheAmishMan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:25:48 2015 UTC,"Have a look and see if the ""WLAN AutoConfig"" service is running, if not start that and see if that fixes it."
Surface,3b4c0i,-IRB-,0,Fri Jun 26 11:51:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it has failed. SP1s are getting old now anyway. You could get a USB WiFi adapter for under $20, see if that works."
Surface,3b250t,cjthelesser,3,Thu Jun 25 10:34:27 2015 UTC,How  is it powering the surface. It doesn't plug into the micro USB
Surface,3b250t,soggit,2,Thu Jun 25 11:08:04 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I actually don't know. It hadn't even occurred to me how it's charging. It must be via USB 3.0, since the dock connects to the Mini Display and USB ports."
Surface,3b250t,cloudev,3,Thu Jun 25 11:14:30 2015 UTC,Could you get a close up image of the usb 3 plug on the dock. I am interested to see the pins on this.
Surface,3b250t,silentknight111,3,Thu Jun 25 13:21:32 2015 UTC,"sure! here you go: http://imgur.com/a/ERWnj  Sorry if they're shit, kinda impossible for my camera to focus while close up. hopefully the flash helped."
Surface,3b250t,redditor1983,2,Thu Jun 25 20:42:30 2015 UTC,Nice inkling.

Surface,3b250t,dlevasseur,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:42:53 2015 UTC,"A little backstory to my experience at Best Buy today: my local BB almost never has the Surface 3 docking station in stock, usually they only have the Surface Pro 3 version. While browsing their website, I noticed it said they were in stock so I quickly rushed over there. At the PC section, I saw a Geek Squad member so I asked clearly if they had the Surface 3 dock, not the Surface Pro dock. I even give him the SKU to make things easy. He says they do, so he leaves and comes back with it. Except it was the Pro one. I told him no, I need the regular Surface 3 one not the Pro one. He then goes on to tell me that both tablets will work on the Pro dock, that ""as long as it has Surface in the name"" they will work. I decide this dude is dumb, so I walk to customer service, give them the SKU and they quickly bring it to me and charge me. Happy ending!  tl;dr: Geek Squad member didn't know the difference between the Surface 3 docking station and the Surface Pro 3. says ""any surface computer"" will work with the Pro dock."
Surface,3b250t,panicalways,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:41:45 2015 UTC,"The Geek Squad employees pretty much exclusively handle extended-warranty repair/replacement jobs, and PC virus removals. Some of them have never even been on the sales floor.  I'm not excusing the poor service, just explaining the issue."
Surface,3b250t,meesterdave,2,Thu Jun 25 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, makes sense. I just thought it was... interesting how someone who works for tech repairs didn't know the differences between the Surface models."
Surface,3b250t,clouds4_17,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:49:42 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who used to be in that industry... Man, there are a million devices out on a sales floor. It's hard to keep up with stuff.  What that employee should have done though is not been so cocky and just double checked the box.   You can't really rely on your personal knowledge when there are hundreds of devices, all from different manufacturers, all being continually updated. So the response to pretty much any specific question should always be ""let me go check."""
Surface,3b250t,ritrackforsale,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:53:22 2015 UTC,"I'd love to get one, but ""dat price""."
