rockhounds,3e5l55,Goatsgiats,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:16:50 2015 UTC,I am in the same spot. Got about 100 pounds of pieces covered the same way. I heard hydrochloric acid soak works. Went to home depot and they only had malagtic acid. So i did a quick Google and that appears to work too. Haven't been brave enough to try.
rockhounds,3e00no,kory_dc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:39 2015 UTC,Really pretty piece there. How many have you found?
rockhounds,3e00no,Lord_Stag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:31 2015 UTC,"Many. this one is about 3 inches, and is one of the larger ones. there are a lot of 1 inch ones were I found this that were pieces of other big ones. I am going back to the spot in an hour with a shovel in hopes of finding a whole one or another like this."

And there are still many artifacts and memories left in my life from that age.   Perhaps a dedicated rockhounding trip would be fitting? There are several great quartz mines in Arkansas (and a diamond mine!) that can offer memories that will last a lifetime. Not to mention some amazing quartz crystals.   Arizona offers ""Apache Tears"", which is rounded obsidian, easily found along roadsides. There are even a few public pay-to-dig mines.  Those  examples are ""easy pickings"",  but anything along these lines would leave a massive impact. Quality time with the family, the experience, the education, finding cool rocks and minerals, AND you get to play in the dirt.. What more could a five year old ask for?!"

Are they still corundum, or could they be something more quartzy, with iron, or magnetite inclusions/matrix?  I really like the blue one, it's the only stone in the batch that's reasonably transparent, and I'm a big fan of the color band.  I'm wondering how common/rare that is in what I assume is a sapphire?"
rockhounds,3dna1u,Slenthik,3,Fri Jul 17 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"Colour zoning is common in sapphire. Yes, they need to be transparent or at least translucent to upgrade them from corundum to sapphire or ruby. I like that blue sapphire too, I think you could do something with it.  Rubies need to be red, otherwise the stone is just another form of sapphire. Even if it's pink, it can't be described as a ruby. Rubies actually fluoresce slightly in daylight, for that to happen the cause of their colour needs to be chromium, if there is any iron in the stone it extinguishes the fluorescence and a lot of people would not accept it as a ruby, even if the stone is red."
rockhounds,3dna1u,w3bm3dic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:48:41 2015 UTC,Corundum can come in many colors. The biggest thing is the hexagonal symmetry and (I think) pintacoid termination

I had a blast and it's a big search area.  That is the only one I've actually had the chance to visit, but I know in upstate Maine there is a great mine for beautiful watermelon tourmaline...the name escapes me but I'll try to find out for you.

rockhounds,3dln2w,_DrPangloss_,3,Fri Jul 17 07:16:44 2015 UTC,Mount Blanchard isn't good for young kids if you are going for the Stilpnomelane.  The location there that I'm familiar with is a cut right by the road with a  drop on the other side.  Also the minerals have to be chiseled out of hard rock.   You can find small agates on the Beach in Birch Bay.  You could also go to the South Fork Nooksack river around Acme and look for jade pebbles.
rockhounds,3dln2w,1TrueScotsman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:33:43 2015 UTC,"You're being steered well here- I was at the stilpnomelane site last week and it's definitely not kid friendly (they wouldn't make great polishers either). I would look for agates to buff up- either on beaches (Locust is nice, off Marine Dr) or in creeks (eg Friday Creek on the county line, which is filled with quartz chunks from the Darrington phyllite). Good luck!"

There's a lot of sulphur elsewhere in the system as evidence by pyrites (and the smell) in other nearby tailings piles so bornite is my first guess given the small presence of native copper in the rock.
rockhounds,3dkd8h,kaarno,2,Thu Jul 16 23:46:43 2015 UTC,"Alright a fellow Utahn.  I have seen some similar coloring from tailings in Cache county.  Mostly copper and galena up there but we do get the purple orange, green and some blue."
rockhounds,3dfoy1,Evoraist,5,Wed Jul 15 22:21:07 2015 UTC,Super iron out is safe for most minerals.
rockhounds,3dfoy1,TheRedditRockhound,5,Thu Jul 16 01:47:32 2015 UTC,They're dolomite crystals. I use a soft toothbrush and surgical soap for my cleaning.
rockhounds,3dfoy1,llama_laughter,3,Thu Jul 16 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"This is my guess, too. Dolomite. And I too would use a soft bristle toothbrush and soap or Crest brand toothpaste, or noxon 7, or metal polish or just don't do anything. They really look nice the way they are. They've got nice structure and a bit translucent.  I've used Muriatic acid in the past, and still do as the Dol's in my area get rather rusty, but you must stop the process after a short while and rinse and soak them thouroghly."
rockhounds,3dfoy1,Inlander,3,Thu Jul 16 19:17:57 2015 UTC,An ID would be necessary to know for sure. Maybe go with breaking off an edge crystal an trying that first. Depending on what the mineral is you might want to use iron out if the clay is very hard or irony.

rockhounds,3dfoy1,theideanator,2,Thu Jul 16 05:17:23 2015 UTC,I clean most of my crystals using muriatic acid.  Yeah this stuff is super dangerous. But will take the stains right out.  Use super caution.  Will also eat away softer minerals.
rockhounds,3dfoy1,theideanator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:02:24 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Being that I mostly mess around with fossils I have 3% peroxide and 12% (gel used in salons) peroxide. As well as 5% and 10% acetic acid. It is hard to find some stronger stuff without permits. I think I could get 20% acetic acid but not really sure I need it in most cases.
rockhounds,3dfoy1,theideanator,2,Thu Jul 16 01:09:03 2015 UTC,"They sell 30% acetic as glacial acetic for photo processing and you can get muratic acid (36% HCl), 'fire' type drain cleaners (usually 98+% H2SO4), and various bases, pool chemicals, etc. from Home Depot with no problem.   Oxalic acid is commonly mentioned as a rust remover and a canadian hound on youtube frequently mentions ""something gentle like Coca-Cola"" to remove calcite on stuff that HCl will eat."
rockhounds,3dfoy1,canoxen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:27:33 2015 UTC,Getting stuff sent through the mail is the problem I encountered.  Do they sell the photo processing stuff without permits? Or do you just pay hazmat type fees?
rockhounds,3dfoy1,brealytrent,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:02:31 2015 UTC,If the need to ship stuff is a necessity than most things corrosive enough to clean minerals will probably require hazmat or something. AFAIK photo processing chemicals don't require permits and the stores that sell stuff will be more rare than Home Depot et. al.  Something else you could try would be an ultrasonic cleaner.
rockhounds,3dfoy1,crypticlazr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:12:47 2015 UTC,I have one of those. It is a small jewellery cleaner. I am worried that might fracture the crystals though.

rockhounds,3dg1pv,GreenStrong,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:28:44 2015 UTC,"Here is a pretty good article on faceting rough evaluation  A chunk of glass is actually a resonable choice for our first cutting project, but after that, the mechanics of faceting are fairly easy.  (It is also easy to grind a facet for a second too long and ruin an hour's work).  What is difficult is looking at a piece of rough stone, visualizing the finished gem that will give the best yield, with the fewest flaws.  Once you have chosen a design and put the stone on the dop, you are following a mechanical process; getting it to that point is difficult.  I don't know about that amethyst on ebay, but something big and relatively clean like that is a great choice for a beginner."
rockhounds,3dg1pv,Doc_Stihl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a fairly new faceter myself. I've bought a bunch of rough from ebay. I have been to mineral shows, rocks shops, and bought from dealers online.  A few things I'd avoid until you get some other stuff under your belt. Glass filled and heat treated corundrum (rubies/sapphires). The folks that sell these are photographicly talented. I bought about 40 different auctions from overseas, I now filter out ALL of them because of many disappointments.  ANYTHING from ebay that doesn't have a clear picture. Just because someone says its AAA clear VVS1 doesn't mean anything. It might have a 2mmx2mm clear spot in the middle, that doesn't make it prime faceting material.  My first handful of stones I cut I went to a rock shop and bought some smoky quartz, rose quartz and amethyst tumbled stones. I got lucky. $10 scored me a half dozen facetable stones.   I would suggest going and finding some colorless or pale sunstone. There are lots on Ebay with lots of material. Cuts nicely, is relatively cheap, and doesn't have much drama when polishing. I'd avoid corundum until you have cut a few other stones and are equipped to polish with 50k or 100k. I'd avoid topaz until you're up to speed with cleavage planes."

rockhounds,3d56x7,ces614,7,Mon Jul 13 17:20:15 2015 UTC,I would first sort  through them to keep out any that might even be close to gem quality. Rubies are corundum which is very common and very hard so if you need to really reduce tumbled stones quickly this would be do the trick!  Most of those looked way too small to do much with. A faceter would probably need larger and/or higher quality stones to get any yield out of them. On the other hand they might be pretty in a jar with some matrix knocked off.

rockhounds,3d5l3e,ethanfez45,5,Mon Jul 13 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  A dremel will polish rock, with the right attachment, but it woould be very slow for shaping it, and unless the stone is already very smooth, it needs some shaping.  Also, a dremel is less ideal than a foredom flex shaft, because a flex shaft has a chuck like a drill and can hold any size tool, unlike the colletts of a dremel that hold only certain sizes.  A dremel with variable speed goes from ""too fast"" to ""way, way too fast"" for rock polishing.  Finally, rock grinding and polishing is done wet, that easy with a dremel.

rockhounds,3cz45f,southernfacingslope,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:25:46 2015 UTC,Klamath range is east of Medford/Applegate. Then you have the Siskyous going east west then the coastal range going south to north.

rockhounds,3bys3o,Golden_Pear,5,Fri Jul 3 06:46:39 2015 UTC,It is a specimen as is - removing the mica will cause the tourmaline to crumb apart and destroy the specimen - I'd leave it a lone.
rockhounds,3bys3o,rockinhound,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:31:46 2015 UTC,"I would advise you not to remove any mica.  I really can't see much mica as it is, maybe it's just the pictures, but if you look at the tourmaline, it's really fractured and most likely wouldn't be able to stand on its own without turning into tourmaline dust, and no one wants tourmaline dust.  (well, no one I know)  But great finds nonetheless! Great color and size as well! If anything I would suggest a good scrub with soap and water if you haven't already."
rockhounds,3bys3o,canneddan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.   You're right, it does look good once I removed the dirty surface mica.  I might soak it in oxalis acid since there's a lot of rust staining on it."

Most collectors keep records of their acquisitions, with location of the find, dates, prices if purchased, and so forth. I'm told that  minerals without locale, for example, are worth only a fraction of their value with complete ID and history.  Many mineral dealers are like used car dealers, only less honest. I've been collecting both in the field and from dealers for the past 25 years.  One honest mineral dealer I've known and dealt with for that long is John Betts, in New York City. [  Google John Bett minerals - there's a lot of information on his site besides rocks for sale. ]  But he probably wouldn't be interested without an inventory of what you have, he can't judge whether the collection is worth traveling a thousand miles to review."

rockhounds,3b966i,Laughing_Fox,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"That's normal depending on where they are from. Generally the crystal is hexagonal. There are several areas in Montana for sapphires the top ones being Phillipsburg, and Spokane Bar Sapphire Mine in Helena. The Spokane one you'll see larger stones w/ cooler tones. Even the pinks/rubies that come from there are cooler, and even though its the same kind of deposit as Gem Mountains the stones are closer to the source which means you'll see that crystal structure more often."

There are about two pieces that I don't need any help with in order to see it..  I'm new to this, and I had simply assumed that whatever effects I'm getting by wetting them might be drawn out more with some polishing, or anything really. That's why I'm here.  I don't really want to cut them, maybe to trim off some rough so I can get more color to show. However, as close to original is my goal. They're beautiful just how they are.. just fishing for some advice.  Thanks for your time."

rockhounds,3asyc5,Bbrhuft,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:43:48 2015 UTC,I have opals with very nice opalescence that haven't been treated or coated. It's all about the opal quality.   A layer of lacquer or something like that only helps to try and keep the water inside the opal from evaporating but it will not make much improvement.
rockhounds,3asyc5,Morigain,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"If they have been dry for a long time they should remain dry, it would  be a good idea to get them and keep them out of water."

rockhounds,3asyc5,Morigain,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:57:36 2015 UTC,"I find this type of opal fascinating, it's called hydrophane opal. I used to have several specimens (lost in an office move) that had this reversible opalescence, I used to wet them and see the opalescence form and then dry them on a radiator. They never lost the ability to oscillate between opalescent and non-opalescent for the 10 years I had them.   I object to calling them a scam, once you know what you're buying and understand the opalescence is ephemeral, which isn't hard as the ones I bought were sold in a bowl of water."
rockhounds,3asyc5,Bbrhuft,0,Fri Jun 26 04:02:35 2015 UTC,"it's called hydrophane opal.   This kind of things make me cringe.   Would you consider a mineral doped with a chemical element in a lab in order to make a pretty color not a scam? Or died agate?   Opalescence is given by H2O linked with SiO2 phases, adding water to opal with low H2O content in order to make it opalescence is the same thing as Ti Quartz."
rockhounds,3asyc5,Morigain,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:10:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not, it's not an artificial fakery or a scam. It's an interesting phenomenon, just like tenebrescent Hackmanite.   Would you consider the colour reversal of Hackmanite exposed to UV light fakery too?   I changed the colour, not someone else who was misleading me. I also hate garishly dyed agate, heat treated amethyst, radiation ""enhanced"" blue topaz etc. that's passed off as natural.   But at the same time I find it scientifically interesting that agate, citrine and topaz can be artificially altered. I'm am interested in how it's achieved, what happens at the atomic and molecular level.  Here's a fascinating paper on the Ethiopian hydrophane opals...

Inducing opalescence by adding water to the system is as fake as heating an amethist to make it citrine. It's exactly the same thing, in one case you ad water to the thing in the other you cure defects.   If you are so interested in what it's going one you should understand that adding anything to a mineral is faking the mineral, regardless if you ad a compound, element or energy."
rockhounds,3asyc5,Morigain,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"You do not understand that changing the color of a mineral to mislead someone else, which is fakery, not the same as changing the color of a mineral myself in order to observe and understand the process behind the phenomena.   That's why I've never bought a burnt amethyst sold under the misleading name of citrine, but I have tried to cause the colour of amethyst to change to yellow by heating it in an oven. That is not fakery, it becomes fakery if I sold someone my artificial ""citrine"" as a natural stone.   That way I can hate the ""citrine"" sold in shops, that's sold as if it is natural, but find my attempt at heating amethyst interesting.  If you are so strict in your application of what is natural and what is fake, then is tarnished chalcopyrite fake? Oxygen is not natural underground, is tarnished chalcopyrite as fake as Ti Quartz? It is similarly due to a thin coating that causes interference of light.   Tarnished chalcopyrite is fake when sold as bornite, in this case chalcopyrite is treated with dilute acid and then left in strong sunshine, which exaggerates it's iridescence."

Back on track, adding something to a mineral and calling it a natural process by the statement of ""it's a natural process"" is the same thing as heating amethist, the destruction of defects it's also a natural process. That is all I'm saying."

I found this online by searching for ""Arkansas Mineral Club""  It lists a number of Arkansas clubs.   I live on Long Island, NY. My mom was a charter member of the Nassau Rock & Mineral Club back in the early '60's and I grew up as a 'pebble pup.'  Though I no longer collect, I still keep our collection on display. We use the top of a glass-fronted china closet as our rock cabinet. For your son, he can start by organizing his rocks by using an egg carton.  You might want to know that insurance concerns regarding children in dangerous places like quarries, usually keep children from attending club field trips, but they may have a sub-group for kids that keeps them involved.   I don't know about Arkansas, but NY has an Earth Science regents exam that tests the students on all kinds of geological terms and processes. Rock collecting is very helpful for this.   Tools: hammers that are made of one piece of steel (masonry hammers) - they usually have a point where the claw of a claw hammer goes - good sturdy shoes, a shoulder bag to carry your finds in and zip bags, plastic deli cups and other things to put your finds in.  If sifting stream bed gravel or loose soil, make a shaker box frame out of old wood and staple 1/4 inch hardware cloth over the opening. It will look like a giant, square colander.   Enjoy! There is so much to find out there!"

There are also some very nice outcrops of archean greenstone to the north in the Huron Mountains. You can also find a lot of jasper and banded iron formations to the south of US-41 if that is your thing.

You'll have to do a Specific Gravity test on it to tell the difference.  All are commonly carved by jade carvers.

rockhounds,3a3oap,Alukain,2,Wed Jun 17 19:17:08 2015 UTC,Something about the gleam looks different than Obsidian. I work with it quite a bit ( I cut and polish it for jewelry) and it looks more like Anthracite (maybe jet?) to me. The difference is pretty easy to tell. Obsidian is essentially glass so it will be much harder than anthracite. It will also be much more dense feeling.

If so, my best guess based on the pictures is your probably looking at a unique piece of Basalt. Basalt is that common looking blackish blue rock that you'll in a lot of the cliffs on the north shore.  It is hard to tell from the picture though. Is it heavy for such a small piece? Also is it magnetic? Also can you give it a good cleaning and snap a photo of it wet. Do it with some better lighting, like go outside. If looks sorta waxy, and reddish when, you might be looking at banded Jasper which is pretty common on the north shore. But it is so dark in these photos that I really don't know."

Ours are the bad kind though. Unless kept in water, the marcasite gradually breaks down into a fine white powder until it is all gone. If you open a water jar in which the marcasite is kept, it stinks of sulfur.  If your marcasite does not break down, slices would make pretty jewelry pieces."

rockhounds,39i41a,Gregey,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"Concretion:        For other uses, see Calculus (medicine), enterolith and nodule (geology).   A concretion is a hard, compact mass of matter formed by the precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between particles, and is found in sedimentary rock or soil.  Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape, although irregular shapes also occur. The word 'concretion' is derived from the Latin con meaning 'together' and crescere meaning 'to grow'. Concretions form within layers of sedimentary strata that have already been deposited. They usually form early in the burial history of the sediment, before the rest of the sediment is hardened into rock. This concretionary cement often makes the concretion harder and more resistant to weathering than the host stratum.  There is an important distinction to draw between concretions and nodules. Concretions are formed from mineral precipitation around some kind of nucleus while a nodule is a replacement body.

rockhounds,39hwzj,frissonic,2,Thu Jun 11 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"I bought myself a $50 tile saw (new) for cutting rocks of all kinds. I cut a single quartz geode I received as a gift and it did the job easily, and both halves of the geode remained intact. I wasn't sure the tile saw was going to meet my needs, so I went for the cheapest one in case it was a failed idea, I think it's a 6"" saw.  In retrospect, I would've preferred a larger saw, it'd be nice to cut once instead of having to flip the rocks around to finish the cut - even rather small ones require flipping. The water basin drains really fast - I'm not sure if this is common to all tile saws. Also, something to look out for is to make sure the saw and the guiding rail (not sure what this is called) are relatively fixed, or else cuts will not be perpendicular to the tile saw's table - the guiding rail on my cheap unit isn't completely fixed, it wobbles, and the saw blade doesn't seem to be perfectly perpendicular to the table."

I know there are a few abandoned mines in the area along trails, but all are closed up. Might be able to find something near the entrances if you are extremely luckily.

Yes, you could luck into one that would be worth displaying. Tumbling the larger opaque ones can produce nice specimens. I believe that polishing allows more light to enter and be transmitted; therefore, a less-than-perfect stone can still be impressive, perhaps made into a small cabochon?"
rockhounds,39bpf2,jmancuso321,3,Wed Jun 10 18:11:17 2015 UTC,"Well, this was the answer I'm sure my wife was afraid of. I will resume excavation. :)  Thanks for the info!"
rockhounds,39bpf2,batubatu,3,Wed Jun 10 18:25:57 2015 UTC,The nice thing is that it is a cheap and safe hobby - just a tumbler and some grit and you're on your way to polished garnets. Much better than motorcycles or woodworking!

rockhounds,398ixb,furrowsmiter,3,Wed Jun 10 00:53:22 2015 UTC,Basically the best way is what you described - unless you have some power tools like diamond blade cutter or diamond chain saw. And it would be nice to see that graphite as this is quite uncommon mineral for pegmatites. It might be something else.
rockhounds,398ixb,mineralexpert,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:39:32 2015 UTC,I'll post a pic either way.  It is nice.  Just one lone crystal in a sea of qtz and kfs.  Edit: Thanks!

rockhounds,393gdo,Cranky_Hippy,12,Mon Jun 8 23:58:17 2015 UTC,looks a bit like kiln slag or blast furnace slag
rockhounds,393gdo,dnld,3,Tue Jun 9 00:20:17 2015 UTC,I second the slag vote
rockhounds,393gdo,i_r_serlx,3,Tue Jun 9 02:09:01 2015 UTC,Third. Especially if near a mining town. That crap is everywhere
rockhounds,393gdo,superhelical,3,Tue Jun 9 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"It's very hard and porous on the end. Color is pretty uniformly black with some reddish discoloration in the scooped out part that looks like a drill line maybe?  I live near a lot of coal mining, that was my first guess, but it doesn't look like the pictures of coal. Obsidian was my second guess."
rockhounds,393gdo,ces614,3,Tue Jun 9 00:00:14 2015 UTC,If it has a conchchoidal fracture pattern (circular) it might be obsidian. Other wise I'd guess glass slag. I had a WA expert explain that there were lots of small glass manufacturing places 100 years ago and so anywhere there are old settlements you will likely find slag glass. Coal is very light in the hand and not very dense.
rockhounds,393gdo,batubatu,2,Tue Jun 9 16:56:15 2015 UTC,"It does have conchchoidal fracture patterns, the one side with what I thought was drill marks is actually that. I will try to get a better picture later though, not sure if it is possible, since I only have my phone camera."
rockhounds,393gdo,ces614,2,Tue Jun 9 17:27:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry, it is not obsidian as it is not glassy enough, the spherical bubbles strongly indicate slag, and obsidian would be very rare in NW Washington."
rockhounds,393gdo,eleitl,2,Tue Jun 9 18:15:27 2015 UTC,We get some obsidian just about everywhere but yeah it's mostly in Central WA. Also I don't recall ever seeing obsidian with a pitted surface so I'd have to say slag glass as a best guess :-)

rockhounds,38w99y,tragedyinwisco,27,Sun Jun 7 10:36:10 2015 UTC,"It is natural. Although it has been weathered since the formation of those holes, they are resting traces for boring organisms (such as certain types of clams: Penitella penita). These clams will get into the rock as younger organisms and as they grow, bore out a larger chamber while keeping the opening relatively small. It is a defense mechanisms ensuring predators can't pull them out. This boring phenomenon has been occurring for millions of years and is a tool geologists use to help interpret the environment at time of deposition."
rockhounds,38w99y,OrogenicSubduction,6,Sun Jun 7 11:48:38 2015 UTC,I found it on a beach if that matters

We don't have that species at Sterling Hill, although there is a variety of olivine (forsterite) at Sterling Hill.  That looks like a nice gemy willemite!  If you lamp it short wave you'll see that gem section goes a nice green.  It's not the brightest willemite can get because there's something about the gemmyness that affects and dims the fluorescence.    Was it sitting on the surface or did you have to split something to find this(might have had a weathered exterior). Also, where did you find this piece? I know the dumps fairly well and am hazarding a guess that it was on the far left along the fence of that straight section just as you walk into the collecting area?  They have put a lot of new material in that section, but it is entirely possible to find stuff like that in other areas too."
rockhounds,38tri9,canneddan,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it doesn't glow green or any color at all, and it was on the far left. The people in the building told me it was most likely olivine."

Lots of things I find myself telling my friends over and over, especially the coated quartz. Damn shiny rocks...  I don't think bashing the New Age crowd was appropriate ( for all that I actually agree with your sentiment, and asking the amethyst/citrine question IS fun) because you want to be open to as wide an audience as possible. Some of those metaphysical junkies end up learning a thing or two and become proper rock hounds, but even if they don't, they deserve honest sales and accurate products as much as any of us.   Discovering that your 'spirit stone' turquoise is actually plastic is just as upsetting as finding your Tahitian pearls are actually dyed."

You might not be looking for the primary commodity but the search results also give the secondary and tertiary commodities as well as gangue if applicable. You may also be interested in minerals that are associated with those commodities. It even lists gemstones as a commodity. It also lists sites that are past producers (non-active mines). You don't have to settle for commodities that have been mined; USGS also lists occurrences and prospects.

rockhounds,38pl8o,crypticlazr,2,Fri Jun 19 01:47:22 2015 UTC,yes jasper does have agate sometimes running through it this very well could be a jasper-agate

It's hard to get information on through public sources, but honestly the greatest success I've had is by visually scanning google maps satellite-view for holes in the land. They're hard to spot through the trees but you can find them. Definitely note that they are almost all on private property AND extremely dangerous to visit, so don't expect a leisurely stroll. We free-climbed cliff sides with nothing but a pair of gloves and a sturdy rope to hold onto.  I have the coordinates of several of these abandoned mines. PM me and I'll happily share them with you.

rockhounds,37th6r,jmancuso321,3,Sat May 30 06:46:55 2015 UTC,"How Does Jasper Form?  While agate is typically a material that forms in the cavities of an igneous rock or limestone, jasper forms when fine particulate materials are cemented by silica. This often occurs in soft sediments when silica precipitates and cements them into a solid mass. These included particulates are what give jasper its color and opacity. A sedimentary material known as chert forms in extensive bedded deposits, and as an opaque variety of chalcedony it receives the name “jasper.” Jaspers are also known to form when volcanic ash is cemented into a solid material from the precipitation of silica from solution.   http://rocktumbler.com/blog/what-is-agate-jasper-chalcedony/#gsc.tab=0  From my experience jasper is opaque  red or yellow in color and typically forms in hydrothermal environments usually in or around igneous rocks. Chert usually forms in sedimentary rocks.   A lot on the subject breaks it down to color. Both chert and jasper are microcrystalline quartz. If it's red/yellowish it's jasper, other opaque colors it can be chert. I haven't seen jasper banded, but I have seen jasper form in layers like in BIFs."

I've only recently taken an interest in rocks so, instead of tossing it into the bushes like I usually do, I washed it off a bit and was surprised to see it loaded up with garnets of various sizes. My interest piqued, I decided to screen off some of the dirt and see what I could find. In the process, I hit something significantly larger (pictured with a 4"" scoop for scale) which I then spent the next hour unearthing. I couldn't believe how many pea-sized garnets were coming out of the dirt I've been digging in for nearly a decade now. The last image represents about 1/4 of the garnets I ended up pulling out of less than 5 gallons of dirt."

It might be a fun weekend to take some of that soil and learn how to do some gold panning.

I panned a bit of the dirt from around the larger rock and didn't find anything other than a lot of smaller garnets. Now I'm tempted to poke holes in a few more spots before giving up on the idea."

I saw some pretty rocks others had found at the pay sites.  I think the thing to do was pay to walk the tailings, but it may depend how many people are with you.  I think the price was like $500 for a bucket load or $100/person to walk the tailings.  Mind you this is the bucket of some big machine, so it's a lot of material. If you do want a bucket you may need to make a reservation.    Again, this is just what i picked up being down there.  I did not actually go to a pay site.    I will say that you should bring some jars to store your stones in water if you dont want to buy the fancy holder things.

rockhounds,37rn4f,HidingUnderHats,2,Fri May 29 23:41:58 2015 UTC,Opal is compromised of mainly water so if you dry it to fast it will crack.

rockhounds,37o3x6,angrymachinist,2,Sat May 30 01:03:44 2015 UTC,"Properly tumbling rocks requires leaving the tumbler running for 6-10 days while filled with rocks, polishing grit, resin beads (or small media) and water for 3-4 phases. In all, it takes about 3-4 weeks to go from rough to high polish.

rockhounds,37nzso,jmancuso321,0,Fri May 29 01:19:58 2015 UTC,I have been using several different size hammer drills for rockhounding for the past 4 years . Different  sizes for different locations . all of my hammer drills are 120 volt electric  . Battery powered ones are too expensive for anything that has enough power .The hammerdrill that you use in any location will most likely be determined by the output of your generator . more powerful generators are very heavy and tough to lug around from where you may have to park to where you are going to dig . it is a trade off .  If you can safely leave a generator on site you should go for 5000 to 6000 watts as these are usually not Inversion types like the smaller generators . If this is your own property you should probably invest in a job site box that can hold your generator and tools  . the box will keep them safe and dry . also consider getting a generator that runs on propane so you don't have to worry about your gas going bad and fouling your equipment feel free to call me regarding this . Good luck .                  Eric    631 821 3855

rockhounds,37iut5,angrymachinist,2,Thu May 28 03:40:23 2015 UTC,"Motor burned out so I used a drill, needed a shaft with the right diameter, screwdriver fit."
rockhounds,37ju36,dl_geo,2,Thu May 28 03:42:13 2015 UTC,Not into the fairburn agates?? Those things are sweet! I found some neat stuff near Guernsey WY which isnt too far from SD
rockhounds,37ju36,angrymachinist,1 point,Thu May 28 04:35:40 2015 UTC,"I know, everybody loves fairburns but me, it seems. I'm all about those pegmatitic minerals"
rockhounds,37ju36,Moop5,1 point,Thu May 28 04:50:30 2015 UTC,"I have spent quite a bit of time in the Black Hills rockhounding. If you are looking for pegmatite stuff like tourmaline then I would suggest the Bob Ingersoll mine just west of Keystone. It's about a 30 minute walk from the road, all up hill. There are lots of tailings to dig through and the main pit is pretty cool."
rockhounds,37g09r,beerplague,3,Wed May 27 10:37:17 2015 UTC,Anyone have a name for this type of crystal? So far I came up with Okenite.
rockhounds,37g09r,GeoHerod,3,Wed May 27 12:20:10 2015 UTC,I'm going to go with strontianite. I've seen some crystals from Pennsylvania that look a lot like those.
rockhounds,37g09r,canneddan,2,Wed May 27 18:21:01 2015 UTC,After looking at some pictures I think you are right. Thanks for the help.
rockhounds,37g09r,crypticlazr,1 point,Thu May 28 13:20:31 2015 UTC,Was it found/collected? Or did it not have a label?
rockhounds,37g09r,Inlander,2,Wed May 27 15:59:37 2015 UTC,Found it today.
