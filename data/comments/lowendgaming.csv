lowendgaming,3e4od8,t12totalxyzb00,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:34:15 2015 UTC,"Well, you could go to ""Documents\My Games\Rocket League\TAGame\Config"" and experiment with the file  TASystemSettings.ini.  Turning some settings to false or 0 could get you some fps, but also could glitch the game, so make a back up of the file as it is now before you do any editing.  Have fun!"
lowendgaming,3e4nyh,VDr4g0n,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"If you want the fps and highish graphical settings, go for the Nvidia laptop. If you, on the other hand, want the pixels and you are willing to sacrifice the environmental detail, shadows as well as the overall effects of the game, go for the AMD build.   My video card died a month ago, and I am using an HD 3000 integrated chip. It runs with everything on low and 720p resolution with the fps above 60. And it plays just fine. Still going strong in Platinum."
lowendgaming,3e4nyh,lacsativ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:51 2015 UTC,"You can play on the Intel 5500 at 1080p with medium/high settings and shadows on low at 1080p. I have the Dell XPS 13 and it plays fine, about 45 and up on fps."
lowendgaming,3e4nyh,tommyv972,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:52:59 2015 UTC,Hmm I always play with shadows off. Can you play high settings 1080p with no shadows with at least 60fps?
lowendgaming,3e4nyh,tommyv972,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:11:47 2015 UTC,"It will be around 50-60 up until the minions spawn and it'll dip just a bit if that answers your question. And I meant shadows off not low, my bad."

lowendgaming,3dofdd,vonkriegstein,2,Sat Jul 18 11:44:06 2015 UTC,"It doesn't. Without the shadows and with reduced VRAM the ingame models feel a bit like plastic, but otherwise it is ok.

lowendgaming,3dm76y,IronMew,3,Fri Jul 17 12:03:08 2015 UTC,What about an Alienware Alpha? I know you can get Nvidia chips in them and it looks to be about the size of a Wii. I know the price can be high on them but I figured I would at least mention the idea.
lowendgaming,3dm76y,Atomsk_The_Pirate,2,Fri Jul 17 17:04:42 2015 UTC,"The idea would have merit if they cost half of what they actually do. I live in Italy, and a quick look at the local versions of Amazon and eBay shows the cheapest Alphas cost some 800 euro. There's no way I can afford this, hence my idea of going for a cheap SoC-based system. I'm aware that using a low-power CPU and Intel integrated video imposes harsh compromises in terms of gaming, I'm just trying to figure out just how harsh they need to be."
lowendgaming,3dm76y,Atomsk_The_Pirate,2,Fri Jul 17 17:40:46 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Yea, that's an insane cost. I've seen them between $300 to $700 depending on sales and what you want in them, so that's why I figured I would at least let you know about them. What does your budget look like? Any games in particular you want to make sure you can play? I know you mentioned retro and indie, just wanted to check for any in particular."
lowendgaming,3dm76y,Moderkay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"I've seen them between $300 to $700 depending on sales and what you want in them   Yeah, I searched on Google US first and the prices looked decent, even appealing (there was one at $500, even), then I searched on Google IT and just about fainted.    What does your budget look like?    The cheaper the better, as long as it has some 3D-gaming capability. The SoC system I mention in the OP costs some 100-150 euro, but I can stretch it to 200 if there's good reason to.  If this whole idea fails then I'll go for a 3D-capable laptop, which is going to cost more (they start around 500 euro), but would at least provide something better than an Intel adapter. However, going this way would dictate a much smaller availability of funds for other things I have to buy before I go, and this would be highly undesirable. Also, as a PC fixer by trade I've learned to distrust gaming laptops, and would much rather have a dedicated little box.   Any games in particular you want to make sure you can play? I know you mentioned retro and indie, just wanted to check for any in particular.   I don't have very specific requirements. Given the monetary restrictions I think I can adapt my tastes to the hardware rather than speccing the hardware to my tastes, I'd just like to know what to expect so I don't get my hopes unreasonably up."
lowendgaming,3dm76y,JeTJL,2,Fri Jul 17 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"i think you should be able to play games such as Quake, Call of Duty 1/2 and Medal of Honor. Of course, there's also Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac which work on anything. I know a friend which played Battlefront 2 and Need for Speed Underground 2 on a small Atom CPU laptop"
lowendgaming,3dm76y,vonkriegstein,2,Fri Jul 17 13:29:55 2015 UTC,"Whoa, that old? I was hoping it could run at least mid-2000 vintage games (CoD2 is more like it). I'm familiar with old Atom netbooks, but I was under the impression that these newer SoCs were significantly more powerful."
lowendgaming,3dm76y,vonkriegstein,2,Fri Jul 17 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"The z3735f is powerful enough to play borderlands the pre sequel with a couple of tweaks, I just bought a used 10.1in Unbranded Windows tablet for $70 and it's amazing. You may want to pick one of those up and get a micro HDMI to HDMI connector and a USB otg cable or Bluetooth mouse and keyboard."
lowendgaming,3dm76y,vonkriegstein,2,Fri Jul 17 19:37:06 2015 UTC,How about an Asus VivoPC?
lowendgaming,3dm76y,Akrash,2,Sat Jul 18 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"Now this is interesting.  It only costs 25% more than the miniPC I was looking at, plus the 1007u it comes with wipes the floor with the z3735f. It also comes with memory slots and a SATA connection, which seems difficult to find on Atom-based miniPCs that seem to only have soldered RAM and an internal non-upgradable SSD. With this one I could actually use my 250GB SSD.  The size leaves something to be desired (I can't believe they made it so it could fit a 3.5"" drive), but I could live with that. Or I could saw off most of the upper half ... hmm.  Thanks for the help!"
lowendgaming,3dm76y,theredbaron1834,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:34:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could use that extra space for the 3.5"" drive for something else like a stash or something haha."
lowendgaming,3dm76y,theredbaron1834,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:30:25 2015 UTC,"I'm actually serious about sawing it off. From the pics I'm seeing the only part of the upper casing that's actually needed is the raised back where all the connectors are. Everything else is just protection for the drive - which I won't need with a 2.5"" SSD - and support for the lid.   Stupid Ryanair forcing me to micromanage my luggage like that... but it's the only company that does the trip I need without costing an arm and a leg. *sigh*"
lowendgaming,3dm76y,theredbaron1834,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"Doing it might be risky though, be careful from damaging certain parts and you also lose your warranty.

lowendgaming,3dm76y,Pomnom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:22:46 2015 UTC,"I need an x86 processor. Arm means no Windows, and no Windows means no PC games. I'm fine with occasional emulation, but I'm a PC gamer at heart."
lowendgaming,3dm76y,StupidSexyConnor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:39:11 2015 UTC,"Dang it, now I fell a rant coming. Sorry, I am not one of those Linux snobs, use what you like, but   no Windows means no PC games   As a linux user, this hurts. Yeah, there are tons of great ""PC game"" for linux. And alot of those are opensource, so arm is no problem for them too. I think there has only been 1 game released in the past few years that I wanted that didn't also come on Linux. That game being AOW3, which is now on Linux, so awesomesauce. There are actually more Linux games on Steam then there are PS4 or Xbone games. As all ""big"" engines now support Linux, I can't see that changing any time soon.  However, the Arm can be a problem. Arm does often mean no ""big"" PC games. There are some, like Star Craft which was hex edited (simplification, but ugh) to run fine on the original Pandora with Arm. Also, Minecraft (the Real one, not the mobile crap) will run great on the Pyra.   However,  yeah, lots have issues. And Wine isn't an answer for them either, as Wine Is Not an Emulator. However, there are shims that work getting X86 linux code running on Arm, a big one was just released for the Raspberry Pi. So it is doable, and I would bet the Pyra will do it well. Plus, android will run on it and there are tones of PC games ported to Android Arm.  However, while I am a PC gamer at heart as well, I am also mobile, aka laptop. My laptop can't play any new games, hell anything from 2005+ so I am left with old ones, and emu's. I have found I really like EMU's. I can run PPSSPP for PSP on an old ass 2008 computer, and it runs great on all games (no need to carry my PSP anymore :) ). NDS as well. Anything older runs perfect. This includes dosbox ( I like DBGL as my dosbox frontend).  Personally, I really want a Pyra. And you can be damn sure that if I get it (price is a bit much for me) I will have some hard core PC gaming going on. It is more then powerful enough to emulate a an X86 linux install, and from there play tons of games, as well as being able to play up to Dreamcast on launch, so awesome Can't wait to play my old Sonic Adventure. Plus, there will be tons of native games, just look at the Pandora. It is like what the PSP scene wanted to be.  However, if you are a windows/osx snob, yeah, ignore all this."
lowendgaming,3dm76y,ChrisOfAllTrades,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"As a linux user, this hurts.   I should have probably mentioned I'm a Linux user as well, and yeah, it hurts. But I've tried open-source Linux gaming, and my experience can charitably be summed up as ""hours of my life I'll never get back"".  When the drivers work the game doesn't. When the game works the drivers crap out. When the game works and the drivers work the graphics are glitchy. When I've wasted enough time tinkering and sacrificed enough goats and lit enough black candles and finally the game works, the drivers work and the graphics work, it turns out that the gameplay is a pile of shit. So off I go play something else, and the whole rigmarole resumes from point one.  As for closed-source, I managed to play one mainstream game on Linux: Minecraft. After a couple hours I gave up and went back to the Windows version, because setting most graphic options had no effect on the game, for reasons presumably best known to the evil digital goblins inside the proprietary 3D drivers.  But I did eventually find the one Linux game that I consistently enjoy trouble-free: lbreakout2. And that's all I play on Linux nowadays.  I love Linux. It's a powerful OS, it's excellent for productivity, it's stable and resource-efficient, and I'd love nothing more than to be able to rid myself of Windows entirely and do everything on Linux. Alas, as a PC gamer, and one who for some reason happens to like games that are old or niche enough to not have much support, I find myself still in need of Windows, because the Linux gaming experience so far has been about as pleasant to me as a DIY tattoo made with rusty nails and IKEA pencils."
lowendgaming,3dkeem,0rangie,5,Thu Jul 16 23:54:14 2015 UTC,"Certainly, I have used Game Maker (the software put out by YoYo Games) for many years and there are still Game Maker games that I'll play today!  You can get a free version of Game Maker on Steam, and Steam also has a lot of games made on Game Maker available (of course, you have to pay for them, but a lot of them are so worth it).  So many high quality Indie titles like Hotline Miami, Risk of Rain and Spelunky were made on GameMaker.  It depends on how ""low end"" we are talking here, but I would think most below average/mediocre PCs these days could run those kinds of games.  My low end PC that runs Windows XP and has 500mb RAM can't run these kinds of games with Steam running simultaneously, but all my other computers are able to just fine.  There's obviously a ton of great free games out there that were made on GameMaker as well, and of course you can make your own games if you're feeling up to it.  If you don't have experience with coding, programs like Game Maker, RPG Maker etc are great tools to make pretty good games with limited coding knowledge."
lowendgaming,3dkeem,Finnbro,2,Fri Jul 17 02:59:50 2015 UTC,I think my favorite game made with GameMaker (that I know used GM) is Battleships Forever - an RTS where you can customize and build your own starships.

lowendgaming,3djujs,hidora,2,Fri Jul 17 00:11:31 2015 UTC,"Copy/paste from an old post I've been using since forever:  I'd strongly recommend against getting too many mods for a 1st playthrough. Maybe get some replacers or different animations, bugfixes, but avoid stuff that change the game's mechanics (overhauls, deadly dragons, Sands of Time, etc).  I'd recommend these, for starters:   Mod Organizer (I heard some complaints of people saying it can be too complicated to set up if you're not familiar with modding, but it's a tad better than Nexus Mod Manager, so I still recommend it; if you really have trouble setting it up, stick to NMM) Unofficial Skyrim Patch Unofficial Dawnguard Patch (if you have Dawnguard DLC) Unofficial Dragonborn Patch (if you have Dragonborn DLC) Unofficial Hearthfire Patch (if you have Hearthfire DLC) Better Dialogue Controls Better MessageBox Controls A Quality World Map - With Roads SkyUI (requires SKSE)   Also, make sure you have these for dealing with mod conflicts:   LOOT for sorting mods automatically. Pay atention to your load order even when using this, though: it's not 100% guaranteed, and conflicts might still happen. I'd say it works about 90% of the time. Mod Organizer has a built-in version of this, but it's outdated. TES5Edit for cleaning dirty mods and dealing with a few other problems. Always run this after LOOT, just to make sure, as it will tell you if there's a missing master problem right off the bat."

I know that highly-rated would mean that it already has some attention and is already popular to some degree, but I think that everyone who considers themselves a serious gamer should at least play the classics of their favourite genres or other video games by their favourite developer and publisher.   I don't think it's because they don't think that these games are not worth playing but more down to the fact that playing systems that you didn't grow up with, or even going back to the consoles of your childhood, isn't something people do too often. They tend to get left behind when the new systems come out. People forget that great game design isn't like technology that gets outdated when something newer comes out.   I'm in the process of buying a few of old consoles, such as the original PlayStation (my childhood console), and a Super Nintendo (a console I'm really interested in), so I can go back and play all these classic video games that I was never able to play as a kid, either because I never knew about or was never able to buy them at the time. Eventually I'd like to get every console from the NES to the PlayStation 2, DreamCast and GameCube.   Does anyone else feel the same way?"

lowendgaming,3d4zb6,BoatCat,8,Tue Jul 14 07:19:07 2015 UTC,"Sacrifice  This game blew my mind when it came out in 2000.  The game plays like a 3rd-person RPG, except that function is merely your Hero/DemiGod/Avatar, which you pilot in order to influence the larger scheme of things, which is an incredibly innovative RTS.  Mana fountains on the map provide your mana regen as long as you control the structure over top of it, and other Temple buildings provide further function.  Your ""unit cap"" is the number of souls you control, and you can increase it by ""stealing"" the dead souls of enemy units.  You capture your own released souls of your own minions by simply running over top of them, but you must perform a lengthy, easily interrupted ritual in order to siphon the soul of an enemy unit.  The game flow, then is an ebb and flow of combat wherein you not only try to wipe out the enemy army, but also kill the enemy controller-unit so that they can't steal their own souls back.  What really gives it life is the incredible story, interactive storyline (As you curry the favour of major gods by doing missions for them, you earn unique spells/units for each, and lose favour with the other gods).  The game has stuck with me, and it was wildly entertaining when I dusted it off just last year."

lowendgaming,3d4zb6,vonkriegstein,2,Tue Jul 14 09:45:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the delay in replying. My C-50 netbook still surprises me both with the games that it can play (even though the system requirements say that it shouldn't), and those that it can't (even though the specs say that it should).  Admittedly, I am a patientgamer with a massive backlog, so I spend most of my time playing old or indie games which are kind to my system.  The biggest problem that I have is with the 1024x600 screen resolution. While it is a blessing that I'm not trying to push my system to high res gaming, a lot of games assume a higher resolution (like 720p) so that I am often forced to play games on my desktop. It's annoying that publishers almost never specify the minimum resolution in the system requirements despite it being the only specification that you can't ignore because the game simply won't run. If you are willing to play at low framerates you can undercut the other specs like CPU speed, memory etc and still get it to work."

lowendgaming,3d4zb6,Sticky_3pk,4,Mon Jul 13 22:20:43 2015 UTC,"Skyrim (over)simplified a lot of stuff from the previous games. While this is probably one of the reasons it sold so well (so more casual players could just pick it up and play), some people prefer a more complex game.  Some examples:   Skyrim removed the classic RPG stats (Strength, Endurance, Intelligence, Willpower, etc.) in favor of only Health, Magicka and Stamina. Skyrim combined some skills into others, so it has less skills. In particular, hand to hand was pretty much removed altogether (the only skill affecting unarmed combat in Skyrim is that heavy armor perk). Classes were removed in skyrim. This, along with the change in stats, makes it easier to do whatever you want with your character, but also means in the end there isn't much difference between one character and another, since everyone can use anything without bonuses or penalties. Birthsigns in Skyrim are only some buffs that you can change whenever you want. You can level up whenever you want in Skyrim, so you can wait until you need the cheap full heal to level up mid combat. Since there are no attributes, your choice of race matters very little in Skyrim. Other than the powers (which aren't really that important and you can go all game without bothering with them), there are 4 or 5 points in the whole game where your race matters for anything at all, and they're very minor. In Oblivion, each race also has different dispositions towards other races. Skyrim has less armor slots. You only have shield, armor, boots, glove and helm, while in Oblivion you also had greaves and boots.   Now, don't get me wrong, I find Skyrim more enjoyable  (more freedom on character builds, easier to pick up and play a new character without planning ahead, and there are a lot more mods to refresh the experience), but Oblivion has its charm, and I can see why someone would prefer it.  Edit: typos"

You can level up whenever you want in Skyrim, so you can wait until you need the cheap full heal to level up mid combat.   I thought this can be done in Oblivion too. In Skyrim you level up using the stats screen and in Oblivion you level up by sleeping.  Its a voluntary choice unless you are doing some rare quest that requires you to sleep.

lowendgaming,3cxnaf,Agandeth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:04:14 2015 UTC,"as long as it's 16:9 (doesn't matter if its 270p, 360p, 450p, 576p or 720p) and mouse input is minimal, it's playable for me.  The lowest resolution I can play is 480x270 (haven't tried 256x144). althou most games runs at 800x450 in my current lowendnetbook. 640x360 still looks okay on 11.6inch netbook. If the a game doesn't like low resolution (like GTA V in this case) at 16:9 then I use ResC.exe and set the resolution to low resolution but still 16:9. set the game to borderless fullscreen at any resolution which doesn't matter as its forced by ResC and yey low res 16:9 gaming.  wished some games to have resolution scaler like BF4 so no need to use something like Hialgo Boost."
lowendgaming,3cxnaf,GearingBonus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:40:20 2015 UTC,30~45 fps is the minimum. Below that and I really need to be in love with the game.  For resolution normally anything 16:9 at a minimum of 1024x768. This is when my CPU can handle the game.

lowendgaming,3cwsan,Agandeth,2,Sat Jul 11 21:31:02 2015 UTC,Can agree.  In my case it is for newer games. I have a C2D E6420 and a HD4670. The GPU can be equivalent to a GeFroce 8800 which is the minimum in some modern-ish free to play or non AAA games I play but most of the time my CPU which was running at 2.13(OC to 2.66) isn't up for it.

Intel HD 1000 Core i3 2.5ghz 4gb ram   As I have shown my game ran in 30 or more most of the time but had some strong slowdown where explosions or close enemies where involved, so I focused on that. To be fair your CPU seems to have a higher clock speed, but I wonder what would be the main bottleneck in such a situation. I do not own any Intel HD 1000, but I am trying to so I can benchmark some game more accurately.    Anyway at least your video doesn't go that route of ""Hurrdurr turn process priority on high""   Yeah, many people treat this as something that always works rather unnecessarily. The only exception that I know of is GTA5 running on a slow (1.7 GHz, two cores) CPU and that was more a case of decreasing the CPU used by the launcher than increasing the CPU time of the game itself.

lowendgaming,3cthxr,stephbu,3,Tue Jul 14 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is good.  The basic tech isn't hard, doing the same at scale with reliability makes it different and harder problem.  Industry is focused on getting reliability at a price point less than $10-15/month (same disposable cash pricing as Netflix, Spotify etc.) for 40hrs(5 days/week @ 2hrs/day). It boils down to a straight forward power cost problem."
lowendgaming,3cthxr,gcdrwhom,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"This could easily be scaled up to lots of users. The biggest technical bottleneck would be having enough bandwidth to stream that many users at peak hours. With Netflix you can pixelate a bit in response to bandwidth usage, but that's not as acceptable with gaming."
lowendgaming,3cthxr,stephbu,2,Tue Jul 14 17:45:21 2015 UTC,"I'd be reticent to say ""easy"", and it depends what you mean by ""lots of users"" and scale. Conceptually it scales fairly well, cookie cutter style - mint machines, rinse, repeat, profit. However there are many subtle logistical constraints that you usually hit once you pass ~1000 machine mark.  Datacenter bandwidth is a consideration, having 1000's of HD/5.1 streams @ ~10Mbit/s is not a small potatoes business.  You're paying at least 30% retail premium for bandwidth.  350TB/month - 10Mbit/s for a thousand machines in a month - comes in at around $3.5K/month. Stepping down to 720p/Stereo reduces it 4x.  It is not unusual to have hundreds of 10Gbit fibre interfaces at major co-locations, they'll want to know if you're going to eat half their bandwidth.  Similarly peerage partners at the other end of the fibre e.g. Comcast, Level3 etc. also want a heads up if you're going to deliberately plan on saturating their connectivity.  Unlike the Netflix business you can't distribute caches downstream to reduce egress.  Network stack is a consideration, more specifically public IP address and port density is a problem.  Unlike web services where a single VIP can front many hundreds of machines, session based services need a unique address/port pair for each session.  Linearly scaling the example can quickly exhaust datacenter public IP addresses.  Of course you pay for each public IP too.  Signing up to provide cloud service with more 10 machines in any region usually requires pre-reservation, a modestly discounted full month/year cost for each machine regardless of hourly use.  To raise this bar requires engagement - cloud providers use this to help figure out if you're going to become a big player.  Pre-reservation quickly becomes a a cash drain when users are clustered in narrow 5-8hr timezone bands, and machines lay dormant out of hours.  g2 prereserve is ~$300/month, and a medium will run you ~$25/month.  You're well into the $250K/month range for 50% utilization of 1000 pre-reserved machines.  Say you'd need 10,000 subscribers at $25/month with 10% concurrent users - roughly the console audience pattern.  Of course you pray for subscribers that are light users of the system.  Audience demand is bursty - people come home from work/school and play 2-4 hrs. Demand spikes by timezone when Central Europe, East Coast then West Coast comes online.  You have a decision to make - pre-reserve for the spikes, or fail to meet the demand at a lower level.  There are tactics to overcome all of these problems focused on driving down total cost per session.  Those tactics also quickly move you from perceived ""easy"" into the harder logistical problems, for example introducing SNAT to up the ip/port density, reselling cycles to utilize machines off peak, premium tiers to pay for surges e.g. new games etc. Costs are also falling as chipsets shrink in size/power and grow in CPU and GPGPU horsepower, 60% of that server bill is power costs.  Waiting a year may cut the costs in half.  Making a profitable business from this is non-trivial, cloud-leasing is the most expensive option where you pay premium for everything, and pre-reservation forces large upfront capital commitments that eat your subscriber income."
lowendgaming,3cthxr,gcdrwhom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:09:17 2015 UTC,"You're right. A dose of bursty demand economics last night tamped my giddiness.

And for a while spot instances weren't even available.   So, yeah, spikes."
lowendgaming,3cthxr,stephbu,2,Wed Jul 15 14:52:07 2015 UTC,Yeah GPGPU is the expensive end of the market.  The recipe is attractive - but the power consumption and hence pricing is too high in this generation of chipsets.  I've got quite a bit of experience creating datacentres for gaming at very large scale.  Hard to build a GPU-based streaming service for millions of users in this generation without being a loss-leader.
lowendgaming,3cthxr,gcdrwhom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:20:26 2015 UTC,Is it the GPUs themselves that're sucking down power or the whole package? I'm very curious where the cost of powering similar hardware at home and doing this in the datacenter meet.
lowendgaming,3cthxr,stephbu,2,Wed Jul 15 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"Datacentre blades are ahead of consumer in the power-reduction curve, new chipsets save big money e.g. comparing Sandybridge to Haswell, 60% loaded 16 core CPU power draw, 180W TDP v. 85W TDP, while the Haswell cranks 25% more work.  The total draw on the blade including multiple spinning media is less than 200W.    Tesla K20-K80 GPUs alone draw 250-300W for a huge compute resource.  It both doubles power consumption and reduces rack density due to thermal dissipation increasing overall floor space costs (another logistics consideration that you don't see in small scale prototypes)"

The g2.2xlarge EC2 instance has a Geforce Titan X GPU which handles rendering and encoding at the same time nicely.

lowendgaming,3chq6h,Exexexpat,2,Wed Jul 8 07:34:29 2015 UTC,"Project Zomboid is a top down game where you see yourself running around killing zombies and building a base to live in, there is no PVP in it but it definitely runs on slower systems. It's also not nearly done, NPCs are not implemented yet and probably wont be for a while, but even in its current state it's VERY playable and has few glitches or anything, I have 150+ hours in it if that tells you anything.  I don't know if it will scratch the DayZ itch but it is still pretty great, cheap and full of potential.   Some others to check out, 7 Days to Die (haven't played yet but heard good things), State of Decay (pretty fun though I don't think it has any multiplayer, though I could be wrong about that) and The Forest (HUGE potential, but feels a little aimless at this time, but if you want to spend your nights crouching in a forest hoping the cannibals don't see you, this is the game for you. Really enjoying it though I'm definitely hoping for a lot more to craft and do as time goes on)"

lowendgaming,3cfmbr,nefffffffffff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:32:07 2015 UTC,Rome 1 is awesome but not extremely realistic.  Medieval 2 is more realistic and has awesome mods.  Both are really good choices.
lowendgaming,3cfmbr,Fingonlfin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:52:57 2015 UTC,I do think Rome 1 is the best starting point especially if you like the period. It still looks and sounds very well and the control scheme for Rome 1 carried over into the subsequent games. It remains many people's favourite Total War game and there are a tonne of internet resources (help sites videos etc) for the game.

Shogun 2 is my favorite by far, and it runs fairly well on the lowest settings, just cant get more than 4k units on screen.  Medieval 2 is a really close second though, first Total War game I ever played, super easy to run, and just so much fun, not to mention some excellent mods. I suggest Age of Petty Kings if you're into Game of Thrones/ASOIAF, and of course Third Age is a great mod.  I've been slowly getting into Rome as well, I suggest it too since it's even easier to run than Medieval 2."

I came here to recommend it as well, since it's a magnificent game that deserves more recognition and exposition. The devs have been providing updates, they care for the community. They're open. I bought it almost when it released, and I spent 50 hrs on it. And they didn't even have half the game complete by that point. I had to stop myself from playing it so I don't burn out by the time it's finished.  It's definitely worth and deserving of full price. It has more content than some AAA games even. And by the time it's finished, which I'm sure it will happen even if it might take a while, it will be even better.  This game is one of the few good things EA has brought us, and I hope they make more great games after they're done with Underrail. They have a lot of potential in their hands."

Intel no longer thinks the performance is so sucky that it would hurt celeron branding. They have a much lower tier of intel HD graphics. The current sticky is my test run of games that run on them!
lowendgaming,3bq3is,theredbaron1834,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:33:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, n-series single core performance are quite low compared to U/M single core performance. also U/M single core performance is quite comparable to i3 if clocked at the same speed. too bad that intel have no plans for official DX12 and Vulkan for Ivy Bridge GPU :/  why your test run is removed though?"
lowendgaming,3bq3is,skferret,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:41:19 2015 UTC,"Ivy Bridge might only have Vulkan (from valve) and that's only for Linux.   This seems poorly worded, as Vulkan isn't made by valve, and isn't only for Linux, and may confuse some people (at those who haven't heard of Vulkan or Linux before)  I think what you mean is that valve has wrote a simple opensource driver for said chipset that they used to test Vulkan on SteamOS, which means it works on Linux. It is also open source, thus I would be quite amazed if Intel didn't add it to their driver for windows as well, as why not (well, at least use it as a reference). However, it will likely take them much longer, as it isn't a big point for them.  Other then that, very informative. I am a Linux user, so the 8.1 crap doesn't effect me, still a good read. I was thinking either a new laptop, or a new video card for my desktop, and this tips me over. I will just wait a while till some good apu stuff drops before getting a new laptop, and get me a AMD 380 GPU instead."

And also the mainboard is quite huge and the last time I tried to fit it into a case I couldn't find enough standoffs.  Another problem is, that the Pentium 3 CPUs fit in the sockets, but the thing to hold it secure doesn't fit, so the slot would be the only thing holding the CPUs.

lowendgaming,3biyus,Agandeth,6,Mon Jun 29 22:30:34 2015 UTC,"IMO the HD 4000 will make more of a difference in gaming than the i5 will.    IIRC the i3 cpu is 2 cores with 4 threads and the i5 cpu is 4 cores with 4 threads.    Some people will say that since Skyrim is CPU bound you might get more performance drops on the i3, but for overall gaming the HD 4000 + i3 will net a better experience than the i5 + HD 3000.  Both laptops will play Skyrim at about low settings, as far as I can tell from Youtube benchmarks."
lowendgaming,3biyus,Dragonsong,3,Mon Jun 29 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"The thing is mobile i5s only have 2 cores (compared to desktop ones which all are quad-core). So yeah, moving to the i3 would be the best choice"

lowendgaming,3biyus,hidora,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, the settings available on Skyrim are really bad. If you edit the .ini files (you can get a tool for doing this if you have no idea what you're doing,  I just used Mod Organizer's built in tool for that), you can probably run it on better graphics than low without losing much fps.  I play it at 28-30fps on med-high with 100+ mods on a i5-3230m @ 2.6GHz, 4GB RAM, and intel HD4000 laptop. Upon installing the game with zero mods I could barely get 20fps."

Honestly if skyrim wasn't so well optimized for dual core CPUs I'd have no chance.  EDIT: nevermind I checked and it was 3000 not 4000"
lowendgaming,3biyus,Liambp,-13,Mon Jul 6 19:15:40 2015 UTC,"The I5 is superior in every way imaginable. More cores trumps clock speed every time. There is no moving on from an I5 to an I3, that would be moving back.  You can play most games on an I3, the I5 will have small-medium performance improvements."
lowendgaming,3biyus,asheppard308,11,Mon Jun 29 18:22:10 2015 UTC,This isn't true Pearberr and I think OP already realises this. Yes the I5 is faster processor but this newer model i3 has better built in graphics and is a better processor for gaming. You can compare the two processors here: http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-i3-3120M-Notebook-Processor.82272.0.html and here:  http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Core-i5-2450M-Notebook-Processor.65510.0.html  But the more relevant fact for gaming is the gpu performance here is the i3's HD4000: http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-HD-Graphics-4000.69168.0.html while here is the i5's HD3000: http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-HD-Graphics-3000.37948.0.html  Scroll down to the bottom for game comparisons. Neither of these are great for gaming but the HD4000 on the i3 is a lot better than the HD3000 on the i5.
lowendgaming,3biyus,LFKhael,2,Mon Jun 29 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"These are, again, laptop processors. Both are dual core with hyper threading. Also the i5 is sandy bridge while the i3 is ivy bridge."
lowendgaming,3bioww,keyvin,4,Mon Jun 29 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"I use it as well but there is a down side. With CPU you can compare them almost directly but be aware that AMD architecture is different and might performe a little slower. With the GPU's always check for benchmarks. Do this because the software they use (which you can download to test your machine) is a synthetic benchmark, so games might run as expected or not."
lowendgaming,3bioww,Agandeth,2,Mon Jun 29 15:47:59 2015 UTC,"My main methodology for it is figuring out the GPU model, then running that through Notebookcheck and Youtube.   When I can't find direct numbers, I try to find a proxy. That's when I'll start using synthetic benchmarks. For example, my college prof was interested in finding out how an 8800 GTX would fare against a GT 610. Those GPUs are so far apart in time that 3dmark Vantage was the only directly comparable number I could find. Or if I can't find out how a game runs on a GT 520M, I can check for how it ran on HD 3000 and usually wind up within 10-20% of how I could expect the GT 520M to run it.  I don't usually worry about clock speed requirements posted for games. A lot of the time, those numbers are posted without reference to a processor architecture or generation. I just assume they're in reference to something like Core 2 Duo era machines in that case. For example, a 2.3Ghz i3-2330M can stand up against a 3.0 Ghz desktop Core 2 Duo because of improvements in the CPU architecture. Intel usually has a 5-10% improvement per clock each generation. Stack that up oger a few years, and you stop worrying about whether or not a 1.6Ghz i5 from Haswell arch can run a game such as Fallout 3/NV that want something like 2.4Ghz.  CPUbenchmark, I don't see as useful. It's one of the most parallelized benchmarks out there, so it almost exclusively favors more cores. However, the majority of games out there today rely on maybe 2 cores, with a small number being able to successfully utilize four or more cores. This means you want the strongest core architecture you can find, while CPU bench will lead you to looking at an 8 core FX over an i5 or i7, when the FX will actually perform worse in games.   Intel's integrated graphics is one of those things where you just get familiar with the different types. Celerons and Pentiums always have the base ""Intel HD"" for their architecture. Laptop i3/i5/i7 models will have the performance variants. Intel's website will tell you what iGPU a processor is using."

Virtually no game can hold a good framerate above 800x600, though. You can flawlessly emulate all consoles older than and including the N64, and probably most Dreamcast games too.

Super House of Dead Ninjas runs ok on low graphics settings, with occasional slowdown, but nothing major from what i've seen thus far.  EDIT: I also tried Devil May Cry 4 (not the new special edition; the older release), running at 640x400, shadows on, super-high texture quality, low overall quality settings, and it ran decently - the test demo was mostly between 50-70fps in the first 'normal' scene, 40-60fps in the forest section (lots of shadows), frequently 70-90FPS in the boss fight sequence, and then dropped to 30-45 fps in the final sequence with lots of enemies on-screen at once.

Shame, as i like games with mecha in them!  I also went back to Devil May Cry 4, to try to eke out a little more performance, and it seemed to run pretty well, above 60fps, on 800x600, Super High texture quality, shadows off.  Then i tried Nights Into Dreams (Steam version), running at 1024x768, and it ran pretty well! FRAPS said it stayed at 29fps (i heard that the PC version is locked at 30fps anyway) for the majority of the time. Weirdly, however, when you collect the stunt ribbon (a power-up that trails a ribbon behind your character for a few seconds so that you can do tricks for score), it drops to 20fps. This seems to happen consistently with the stunt ribbon, but only when you have it. Boss fights, levels with effects such as fog etc. all seem to be unaffected, and run at 29fps. I played two levels so far, and what i've reported above is consistent throughout those two."

It's technically 3 games except the newer ones are backwards compatible with the cards of the previous ones (so the last one, Joe: The Passion is recommended cause it supports all the cards). Requires grinding to unlock cards, so I recommend you get a 100% complete save file to make competition more interesting.  And of course there's good ol' Warcraft 3 and every other RTS of that era.

The lowest spec machine I ran it on was my HTPC which at the time was a E2160 Pentium dual core, with an 8800gt.   So it depends on just how low end you're talking. Tera's engine is really flexable, Since it's a real time combat oriented game, people sometimes go full on unreal tournament with it and turn everything down to minimum for max framerate."

lowendgaming,3ai36r,HorseRaper,6,Sat Jun 20 17:07:37 2015 UTC,Because the 750 Ti usually doesn't require a 6-pin PCIe aux power connector. You can throw one in just about any machine without worrying about the power supply.  And it's a 10 pound difference between the two.
lowendgaming,3ai36r,HorseRaper,2,Sun Jun 21 00:47:07 2015 UTC,Is it a prebuilt? If so what model. Speaking from a personal experience this can matter
lowendgaming,3ahkub,himmatsj,3,Sat Jun 20 06:28:32 2015 UTC,"Exceeding the VRAM will cause stutter and often will straight up just crash everything.  if a game demands more VRAM for assets than your card can provide and does not crash due to anxiety, it'll be forced to hotswap the assets in and out of the VRAM which causes the stutter.  This is a hardware bottleneck and can not be solved any other way that NOT exceeding VRAM.  Now, I'm not sure if that new HBM architecture on AMDs cards is a relief to this type of bottleneck but I imaginr the higher memory speeds could compensate for some stutter by hot swapping faster?  Again, have no actual knowledge of this stuff, just based on hype words and the ol rumor mill.  Anyways yeah I think it's ridiculous how low VRAM is on even most new cards.  The fact that nvidia even offers the 960 GTX in 2GB is a slap in the consumers face.  Everyone knows years-old cards are powerful enough to last several generations if not for some crippling fault.  We watch cards get rebranded over and over and it's really because the tech is just so good it always has more room to accommodate for our artistic demands.    So really, how could you sell a new card to the same customers year after year when your product is so good at it's job it doesn't need annual iterations?  Gotta gimp that VRAM baby, can't be givin them a product that's too good.    And this leads me to an actual issue I have with game developers: why are we using that much VRAM?  I won't pretend to know a thing about coding or game dev, but seriously three years ago there were hardly any games that exceeded 4gb of data in their entirety.  Are we caching entire games onto VRAM?  Like really, even if every asset on my VRAM is vital and can't be truncated, can't we just compress some of those textures of something fellas?  Like even just the mildest form of compression that shaves ~50kb of the top of every texture would be huge.  It often feels like the whiffs of collusion you get with proprietary tech/APIs these days are really having an effect on the products we buy.  Sucks when you're passionate about something and it gets popular and money corrupts it, but at least were still getting some good games."
lowendgaming,3ahkub,poomcgoo8,2,Sun Jun 21 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"I believe devs are getting more liberal with the VRAM due to the nature of the new consoles - i.e. they have lots of VRAM reserves (up to 3GB), but relatively weak GPU power and horrendous CPU power. So the easiest thing to do in this case is to just load as much as you can into the textures, and freeing up the GPU/CPU to do other tasks."

lowendgaming,3a766e,JackintheBag,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:55:15 2015 UTC,I set all the shiny settings to off or as low as DSFix said they could go and basically ran the internal resolution waaaay down.  It's possible that I could've missed something or just did shit wrong.  The main issue with my PC is the onboard graphics. GeForce 9200 256MB VRAM. I'll be upgrading that soon-ish.
lowendgaming,3a5usc,SoloDragonGT,4,Wed Jun 17 13:47:16 2015 UTC,I have a dell Inspiron 15 7000 series with the Intel hd 5500. It plays a lot of games really well actually. Cs go at a nice 50 fps avg at 1920x1080 At medium settings. Haven't tried tf2 but it should run even better. I did play around with battlefield 3 and got around 40-60 fps on low settings at 1366x768 resolution. I Would personally go with the hd 5500. The 1080p screen is a lot nicer and you will be able to play the games you mentioned really well.
lowendgaming,3a5usc,MikeTeezyT,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:12:22 2015 UTC,"Wow that's actually pretty awesome. I remember back when I bought my last laptop how bad of a job Intel did with running almost any game. But that's pretty cool that it can run CS GO smoothly in FHD and Bf3 at 1366x768. With that, it should be able to run TF2 no problem then. Thanks for the insight, I guess I'll go with the 5500 :D"

Um, well, the main ending, the ones you likely saw, were not the ""real"" ending, at least not canon. The one you likely saw you got to make a wish that was based on how much money you had, weither you killed certain people, etc. I can't really say much without spoiling it, but you got the story all wrong if you got these endings :).  The ""real"" ending, you have to follow the ""find the guide"" quest line.  Here is an excerpt of the stalker wiki on how to get that ending (with an edit to hide the spoiler).   To get these endings there are several criteria. First of all, you must speak with Guide after disabling the Psi-emitter in Lab X-16. You must then follow his questline, which leads you to Doctor, who hides out in Strelok's hiding place. He informs OF SOME STUFF THAT WOULD SPOIL THE PLOT. He also gives you the coordinates of a stash in Pripyat. The stash contains a decoder made by Fang, which must be used to decrypt the lock on a peculiar door inside the Sarcophagus. The stash also contains some notes from Strelok's Group, and a SKAT-9M Military Armored Suit.    I really do rec you play through again to get the ""real"" ending, things make much more sense that way. I did, as the first time I played, a few years ago, I wished to be rich, and that ending just sucks compared to the real ending (which I just got a few days ago :) )."

Also, If you don't get the stash with the decoder, it won't do anything and will act just like a normal useless door.  That ending was simply because you have over  50000 Rubles. If you have less then that, and both Duty and Freedom leaders are alive, you can wish for get the best of the ""fake"" endings. Plus, there are 3 other ""Fake"" endings."

lowendgaming,39qk5x,ypoora1,2,Sat Jun 13 20:55:35 2015 UTC,On my desktop if I have a complex abomination creation in free build mode that bogs down my i7 cpu I simply change the time slider on the top left of the screen to get my frame rate back up to acceptable levels.   It might not work as well for you as it does for me but if you do end up buying the game try it.

Morrowind is a fantastic game, with a still active mod community if you don't already have it.   Civ 4 and 3, are very good, and can run on most low end PC's. 5 is a stretch, but it runs just fine on my 300$ ""rig""  The Roller Coaster Tycoon Franchise is a ton of fun, and old enough to run on most relatively modern computers.

Both have workshop support and community pages for user created story content.  http://isthereanydeal.com/#/search:shadowrun;/scroll:#gamelist  Shadowrun Returns  [$14.99 - %80 = $2.99]  -The original kickstarted game. An investigation begins to solve the murder of a friend and fellow shadowrunner.   Shadowrun Dragonfall - Directors Cut [$14.99 - %70 = $4.49] -A much more refined combat system, improvements WILL spoil you if you choose this before Shadowrun Returns, Keep in mind if you're interested in both stories.  The story of dragonfall is a fantastic and existential look into the shadowrun mythos. Focused heavily on the dragons and their monumental impacts politically and socially in the new world.   I highly recommend both, if you will only spring for one, go for dragonfall as most user content for returns has been transitioned to the improved engine."

lowendgaming,39i8pq,SanguinolentSweven,2,Tue Jun 16 08:39:19 2015 UTC,"Knights of the Old Republic: it does lack a huge amount of character customization but its got a nice light side dark side choice system going one. The band of misfits that accompany your character on his/her travels there's a lot of content to explore and your light or dark side choice don't really effect the games overall outcome but does effect your status with your companions.   Its sequel Sith Lords was rushed so a lot of content was cut, this resulted in Sith Lords lacking some of the depth and charm that Kotor has but it is still worth playing. A fan made mod has spent the last several years rebuilding / restoring the cut content.   Both old republic games have a series of fan patches and mods that increase stability, available resolutions and fix bugs. The worlds arn't really open but there is a lot of content, nice pacing, and a fair amount of alternative options available, branching dialog and multiple paths with their own risks and rewards are on offer.  If you are not a Star Wars fan this probably won't make you one but if you are then you might really enjoy it.  Both games are on steam but not on sale, €9.99 each for games this old (will run on almost anything) is asking a bit much imo but well worth it if you want something that is a progenitor of Mass Effect and Dragon Ages style of gameplay.  I've heard good things about Shadowrun: Dragonfall but I'm not that keen on it myself. Its a little too stats heavy and min maxing kind of an tactical RPG for my tastes. Google will help you learn more about this. Min specs look quite low."

Fable 2 Ultima 7 Divine Divinity Game of Thrones RPG (not sure if you can run it though) Jade Empire Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines Arcania: Gothic 4 Planescape Torment  I know you said no Elder Scrolls but check out Elder Scrolls Online if you haven't. It's an MMO so it should scale down to run on your PC.  Not sword and sorcery RPGs but you might want to check out the Deus Ex series. Lot's of content, character customization, choice and consequences, interesting storylines and more.  Dues Ex Dues EX: Invisible War Deus Ex: Human Revolution  I might even suggest Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition. No ""quests"" per se but lots of content and some of the best combat you'll ever play.

lowendgaming,39dm0j,suchtie,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:28:34 2015 UTC,"osu! has had this bug for quite a while now, years even. It is only an issue on Intel integrated graphics.  The reason was recently found - an anti-aliasing option was turned on in OpenGL mode. This particular setting is apparently not supported well by Intel graphics. However, due to the game's design you don't even notice the AA, except in the map editor where it annoyingly blurred some lines. Good thing it was found.  This was literally a one-line code change. In the next release version it'll be fixed. Also, osu! will completely migrate to OpenGL in the future, which will make development easier (no more developing for both OpenGL and DirectX) and also make OSX and Linux ports possible."

They're all low-spec and would probably run on your laptop. Have fun!"
lowendgaming,39662k,builderkid107,3,Tue Jun 9 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"System Shock 2, properly modded it is very playable but does suffer from the older game ""complex is better"" school of design so it can be a little difficult to get into.  Dungeon Keeper 2, be evil you know you want to.  Witcher1 will run on your laptop, you pass the minimum spec by a fairly wide margin. Not sure about Witcher 2 but I'm leaning towards saying it will probably run. Have a look around youtube with ""Witcher"" ""intel hd"" in the search bar and you can see examples of both games running on Intel gpus.  Duke Nukem Atomic Edition is heavily discounted, I know the Megaton Edition on Steam is an upgraded OpenGL accelerated with online multiplayer support version but its 10 times the price of the standard Atomic Edition is on GoG right now. Keep an eye on the Megaton Edition going on sale during the Steam summer sale if that interests you, otherwise get Atomic Edition now for the cheap price.  You know the HD5500 isn't a bad GPU so more modern games like Thrine1 and 2 would probably be playable, Assassins Creed should be playable, Grid should be playable, any of the Tell Tale games (Game of Thrones, Walking Dead) should be playable, Darksiders should run, any of the lego adventure games (DC, Marvel, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc), Pillars of Eternity might be perfectly playable (bit pricy imo).   The biggest factor involved in getting a smooth gaming experience on basic mobile GPU's is try to keep the games resolution down as low as you can tolerate, there is no two ways about it, that isn't a gaming laptop but don't let that stop you getting a respectable framerate. The only thing I'd be worried about is the fact some manufacturers have been playing silly buggers with cooling solutions on what are high spec laptops meaning that throttling becomes an inevitability and your preformance is significantly less than what it should be. Keep an eye on your temperatures while gaming and 10-15 minutes of googling you'll find out if throttling is a known issue with your laptop."

lowendgaming,39662k,Eltitia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:00:32 2015 UTC,"Generally laptop cooling performance is dictated by the dimensions available and parts layout selected by the manufacturer, that doesn't change not matter how much you might want it too so make doubly sure throttling isn't a know issue.  I'll still have plenty of gaming options even if it is a laptop known for its throttling just those games will be older and far less demanding that a lot of games."

Try Invisible War, I found it all around a much better game, and you should be able to play it no problem, as it doesn't need much.  But, then again, FPS, so maybe just not your style.  On to the meat. And prepare, you said linux, so I have to really help now :), and I shall unload. Bare in mind, I am guessing a bit, I don't have that low a GPU, but I did use it before, so I am going with that and expanding a bit. I hope they all work for you :).  As has been mentioned, gearhead2 is pretty cool. Along the same grounds (linux term/gui dual games) is also Ascii Sector (a neat space game), C-Dogs (seems like Gauntlet) and DoomRL (a doom rougelike).  There is also Powder, another rougelike that started as a GBA game, and now is just about everywhere. My favorite rouge like.  Moving on to more graphical games.  As a Linux user (Arch reporting in) Linux native I know a bit about. First up, who doesn't like Zelda (also check the Arch AUR for a bunch of clones too, or here for a engine that just does these types of games) . There is also Pokemon Online, Violetland seems cool, NAEV ( a cool space game), Jedi Academy/Outcast (Star Wars FTW), Summoning Wars (seems cool, but never played), UFO:AI (an XCOM clone of sorts), FreeOrion (Open Masters of Orion, damn this game will suck all your free time), FreeDroidRPG (damn, I love that game), Cave Story+ (simple but cool game), Morrowind (it will be close, but I played it on an old EeePC, so maybe), FreeDink (an opensource engine of the game Dink Smallwood, a Zelda type game), and Bioware's Infinity Engine games (such as my fav Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate.  Of course, you also have your emu's. I have used up to PSX on a much lower system, so you should have no problem with them too. So, check out N64/PSX/SNES/NES/GBA/GB/Genisis/DosBox/etc games to find if you like anything.  Hm, offhand I can't think of any good games that need wine (aside from Deus EX 2). Damn, Linux has really gotten much better that I can post so many good games that don't need wine.  If you want more, want some advice installing one of another, or on getting emu's up (or games for them), ask and you shall receive. Also, sorry if it is rambly. I took quite a bit of time, looking up web pages, making sure names were right, etc, so it was like a half hour to right, and proof reading is for the noobs.

It is in the AUR if you are on arch, I don't know about others though. It should let you get quite a bit more performance out of the GPU. However, I think it only works on x86, so if you are on x64 then it is a bust.

lowendgaming,38wt00,Sebass1656,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:32:05 2015 UTC,"When you join a server on NMRiH that is vanilla (not modified server) late, you have to wait upwards of 20 minutes in order to actually start playing, with Contagion you if you join late you can be a zombie and make the match go by faster. The big thing about Contagion is exploration and trail and error, it took me a long time to figure out what all the phone messages meant and where to go for them but once you do you can go through the levels pretty quickly. Also the animations and such are way better, and there is a new free DLC content update coming that adds more maps and a new game mode.  Ammo and stuff is always random, but it usually pops up in on shelves and such, you just have to keep an eye out."

You can get a gt630 for $15... Not the best card in the world but would be a little better than a hd4600 and it should be a low enough wattage so you wont need to upgrade your PSU. If you can afford a little more you should take Megahz's advice and save up for a gt750ti as that card is leaps and bounds better. (You can find them around $120) Hope this helps a little. If it was me I would probably save up for the 750.  Also there are some mods for skyrim that make it run better on low spec systems.

EDIT:Did some looking into the reviews and found that the game is not pay-to-win, which is awesome. so now i have to ask a different question. While I can only assume that when assembling and sorting through the menus, a mouse and keyboard are probably essential, during the actual shoot-and-drive business that gives the game its actual gameplay, does it have native controller support? Not having this is not a dealbreaker, I'm just a lazy shit who likes to play with a controller so i dont have to set up all kinds of extra crap, as I'm on a laptop, and am always bouncing around places."

They did return after about of 2 years of inactivity, took over the servers themselves (previously it was publisher's responsibility) in order to not let the game completely die and did update some things/fix some bugs, but no major content patch or anything.. There was a small resurgence during that time (even as many as 1000 peak players). Eventually it dwindled down to 250 peak players though..  It still has a playerbase and even community funded money tournaments every month or so.

I know that my board and cpu needs to be completely upgraded before anything else.    Its about 8 years old and even then was a lower end system and considered a ""budget"" system"
lowendgaming,3748fs,Joose2001,3,Sun May 24 22:45:21 2015 UTC,"You can get a new CPU and mobo that can play newer games for around $100. I actually just helped my brother build a computer, and it works nice. Plus, since you have one already, you can keep the case, PSU, HD, etc and save money."

The one I've got is a pre-built Acer model with a gfx card put in and extra ram"

I have gotten a HD5450 for about $1, a internal IR reciver and 2 remotes, all kinds of stuff.   It really is best to build yourself, you save so much money. And while it is scary, it really isn't hard. Even the CPU is easy to upgrade, you watch a tut on youtube and you will see how easy it is.   What video card do you have? Also, what kind of ram do you take? I actually have tons of ram now, always grab them when I see them. Have quite a bit built up now. I could try and mail it to you, if I have some you could use."
lowendgaming,3748fs,theredbaron1834,1 point,Mon May 25 00:04:29 2015 UTC,"I posted over in PCMR asking for advice as I have no clue what Im doing.....  Not really got much atm.........  ANYWHO, this is what Ive managed to gather on as much details as possible (copy/paste from my post there)....  This was/is a pre-built Acer Aspire system, with a gfx card, extra RAM and another HDD shoved in.....   CPU - AMD Sempron 3500+ 2.00ghz  (obviously, that's a single-core) GPU - Geforce 9400 GT RAM - 3gb Label on the sticks shows - ""240pin DIMM 128mx64 DDR2"".  Motherboard - Not 100% sure on this, there's a label on the board that show MCP61SM-AM. Also, looking in the BIOS shows EM61SM/EM61PM.. Again, I have NO idea what any of that means but I'm sure one of you guys do! PSU - Looking at it, 250w is the output"
lowendgaming,3748fs,Joose2001,2,Mon May 25 15:44:31 2015 UTC,"Well, your only real problem here is your CPU and MOBO. Yeah, it isn't the best. Seems the mobo uses AM2, which eh, at least the cpu's are cheap. LIke for less than USD 10, you can get a 2.6ghz dual core.   They really are not hard to replace either. You will likely ruin your old cpu, cause getting the fan off often sucks. However, then you just lift a bar, the cpu pops out, you slide in the new one, apply the thermal paste, close the bar, and put your fan back on. Done.  You could also get a decient mobo that isn't horrible priced, with out upgrading anything else. This is $50, works with your ram and CPU, but I try not to move CPU's, they are hard to get out without Fing up. I have done it, but ugh.  The video card isn't the best either, you can get upgardes pretty cheap too.   You have plenty of ram, enough for most games.  The PSU is pretty underpowered too, which could be a problem. Though eh.  However, the truth is I wouldn't waste your money on anything but the CPU upgrade for under $10. It would help, but your system is quite old and can't go that much better without a complete refresh. If you can find $100ish, you can get a much better computer still kinda lowend, but eh, not bad.  MOBO for $30. It is a referb, but newegg I can trust with that. And it isn't a bad mobo at all.  CPU for $65. Dual core 3.5ghz is nice, plus it uses the Radeon R5 graphics. Nice, and pretty cheap for what you get.  CPU2 for $78. Doesn't have a built in GPU, so would need yours. If you intend to get a new video card, this is best, as it can OC to 4.1 stably.  CPU3 for $89. This one is nice. 3.1ghz (3.8 via turbo) quad core CPU with Radeon R7 GPU. Best one if you don't want an external video card.  CPU4 for $40 if those CPU's are still to much. It really isn't that good, but at 3.7ghz dual core, better then what you have. Has an AMD Radeon HD 8370D GPU built in, so not bad on that either. Better then your current video card.  You could keep using your same hard drive, psu, and even video card (though the built in is likely better for the 3 with it). However, the ram not so much, you have DDR2, it takes DDR3. However2, I have some I could send you some, as I got a bit of DDR3 laying around."

The recommended gpu for this purpose - the GTX 970 costs around 580 dollars where I live, importing it from the USA is even more expensive.  So I would have to spend atleast a 1000 dollars to get a decent enough build, which is insane considering that a PS4 or Xbone is in the 400-500 dollar range.

lowendgaming,36zrgv,rED_kILLAR,1 point,Sat May 23 17:24:16 2015 UTC,League can run well because they optimize it somewhat (ignoring the outdated air client- which is separate from the one used in game). Just last week the 'hide eye candy' option was added on the beta servers for testing. This will remove small animals/bugs/etc to further improve performance.

There is also settings config file in the witcher 3 folder in my documents that can be edited with notepad, make sure to make a backup and set it as read only after editing to prevent the game from changing it back.   Here is a guide , it is geared to turning the settings up, but it should help with finding out what to turn down.

lowendgaming,36o64i,47r,6,Wed May 20 20:31:01 2015 UTC,"8GB is a lot of RAM even for a low end gaming rig, I'm pretty sure none of the high end games today actually require more than 8GB of ram to run at their maximum settings.   Also windows won't let you use readyboost with 8GB of RAM (I have 8GB and I'm pretty sure windows tells me it refuses to enable readyboost because it won't improve my performance at all) and if it did, you won't gain any performance in games at all."
lowendgaming,36o64i,cdlink14,2,Wed May 20 20:51:48 2015 UTC,It won't improve anything if you already have 8 GB of RAM which is plenty.
lowendgaming,36o64i,StillAzure,1 point,Wed May 20 22:35:01 2015 UTC,"Hm, readyboost kinda sucks. So, no, with 8gb of ram it isn't of use.  However, if you also dualboot linux, making a swap partition on one of those might help it. Depending on the speed of the drive, but if you set swappyness up a bit, and you actually do stuff that needs more then 8gb of ram, it could help. I wouldn't rec it on a USB2 device, but 3 gives you the speed where it is at least usable as swap."

Here are games I could still play on a 15 years old PC: AMD Athlon, 1 or 2 GB RAM can't remember exactly. Keep in mind you may have to play with graphics settings...    Dungeons & Dragons Online (DDO): Pretty faithful to D&D mechanics and universe if you dig that. It's playable fine via wine and had decent FPS on my old PC back when I still had it. It's PVE, no PVP that I remember. The quality is great for a free(mium) game, definitely a level above asian grindfests.    Regnum Online: Basically it's a clone of Dark Age of Camelot, with a heavy focus on PVP realm vs realm. Graphics were outdated last I checked it, and the PVE felt much too slow paced but PVP is where it shines and it can be great fun. It also has a native Linux client which is rare.    Ryzom: Another quality MMORPG with a definitely original world (compared to all the WoW clones). I didn't try it on Linux, only Windows but the hardware reqs were relatively low. It has become FTP up to a certain level and also has a native Linux client."

lowendgaming,35w69p,Exexexpat,1 point,Thu May 14 19:02:54 2015 UTC,"My take on the ones I've played:  StarCraft Brood War - sci fi, fast paced, all units are unique, amazing game, and the pinnacle of old school RTS gaming  WarCraft - similar to starcraft, but fantasy and more features. IMO not as good as SC  Age of Empires - medieval setting, slower pace, with a more classic system of identical units except for some uniques for each nation. IMO AoE 2 is the best  Age of Mythology - AoE with some supernatural stuff, really fun but not as good   Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - only played a few games, but it was pretty fun. You build and control squads instead of individual units, and can upgrade them by adding specialists and stuff, interesting system. WH40K is a ridiculously over-the-top scifi universe, and it's awesome   Command and Conquer - sci fi but is closer to reality than others on the list (C&C Red Alert series takes place in the Cold War era, the rest are in the near future), a classic, though I never played much and can't really comment on gameplay  Supreme Commander - sci fi, pretty complicated, but you can end up with much larger armies than most other RTSs, and the sheer scale is quite satisfying  Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds - Basically AoE but with Star Wars."

Depending on your specs though, I highly suggest Sins Of A Solar Empire: Rebellion.  If you like RTSs, this is a great starship fleet commander type game.  All realtime, and there can be multiple battles going on at the same time, worlds apart.  You simply use the mousewheel to zoom into a firefight, or back out to see the rest of the star systems, and back in again, all seamless.

lowendgaming,35e9h6,mrlooneyman,1 point,Sun May 10 04:42:45 2015 UTC,"Intel's Download Centre has a wonderful selection of older hardware, but unfortunately, they do have to drop driver support at times. If you're running a 945, you could try this driver. However, Intel has officially dropped support for the obsolete 800 series iGPUs in newer versions of Windows.  If you're open to the idea of some major tweaking, you could play around with some Linux distributions. Ubuntu and Mint both tend to work quite nicely right out of the box, and I've had overall great experiences with supporting older Intel graphics in such configurations.   The Linux drivers have matured quite well, to the point that it's not uncommon to get better performance in Linux than in Windows with the GMA 800/900 series hardware. If your chipset has the third generation of Intel's ingrated graphics (the 900 series stuff), you even get more OpenGL support under Linux.  I know that this isn't what you asked for, but I do hope that it's at least something to think about. If neitother option would be something like switching back to XP, which I cannot at all personally recommend due to it being EOL."

It's basically a twin stick shooter in giant arenas with persistent levelling of your characters.  It takes a bit to get used to (and there are some bugs, apparently) but I've been having a lot of fun with it for the last week.  The DLC characters are cooler than the stock ones but you don't really need them.  The game spawns enemies and bosses and other stuff semi-randomly, and there are dozens of special Artifacts you can get that can change how you play.  Hero Siege is on Steam, is often on sale, and is really cheap.  Wizard's Lizard is another one but I didn't much care for it; it's on Steam but I got it in a bundle.  There's another one where you're a goth girl, Our Darker Purpose, but I never tried it (though i apparently own it), it's kinda pricey too, 15$."

Look up HD-5450 on youtube and there will be videos with lists of games. Of course always check the minimum requirements but you will run a surprisingly large number of even modern games."

lowendgaming,356fod,xcrunner99,3,Thu May 7 15:19:19 2015 UTC,Spelunky runs great on weaker machines and IIRC it supports the 360 controller.
lowendgaming,356fod,suplexcomplex,3,Fri May 8 01:28:43 2015 UTC,"First of all, I have a 5770, so I am not exactly sure if some games will play,  but I will mention in that case. Also, I have an AMD HD5450 1GB GDDR3 too :). Got it from goodwill, but it is a low profile card, and I can't find the high profile thing, so I can't use it.  First up, why not check out AntiMicro. It is a linux program, but well supported on Windows too. It lets you mark your controller to send keyboard/mouse input.  Dungeon Defenders is a decent tower defense game. Should run well.  Super Meat Boy is a decient game. Can be hard, but damn, its is a pretty good platformer.  Shank is a nice beat'em up game.  Hell Yeah is a cool game. Very bright, kind of like a bloody Donkey Kong.  Metro 2033 is a great shooter. However, I am not so sure it will run for you. It might, as it ran nicely on mine.   The Darkness 1/2 is pretty good. A shooter, with some ""magic"". Not full controller support, you have to use a mouse to enter the game, but close.  I saw in a separate post you asked about emu's. You will be able to play up to GameCube probable, as Dolphin (the GC/Wii emu) is awesome. PS2/Wii are a bit much, but maybe some of their games that are low end would work too. My card can play PS2/Wii no problem for the most part, so yours should do ok for some. Plus for me, this is one Linux. Often times the DirectX backend, aka windows backend, is better then the OpenGL one, so you will likely get more speed, at least a few FPS's, then me."

lowendgaming,353zh6,poomcgoo8,3,Thu May 7 10:13:02 2015 UTC,"It's a space/rocket/plane simulator.  You play as Kerbals (small, alien race) who learned to build rockets before they invented the wheel.  The game has real physics attributed with space travel (thrust:weight ratio, delta V, aerodynamics and atmospheric reentry heat). Your ship or plane can run out of fuel and electricity - do make sure to pack plenty of it!  You can do the math and build rockets designed to perfection, or just mess around and see what monstrosity you can create.  3 modes of gameplay:   Sandbox (every rocket part is unlocked, unlimited funds and reputation) Science (you start with the basics of rocket science and send your Kerbals around the solar system to conduct experiments to unlock better parts) Career (your space program a brand new. You're facilities are small, and underfunded. Complete contracts to earn money and reputation. The higher your reputation, the more difficult contracts become available, and the pay increases). You work to improve your facilities - which will improve other things too.   THERE IS NO END GAME. The only limit is your imagination (and gravity, and fuel, and electricity, and heat).  For some pictures, gifs, and stories, visit /r/KerbalSpaceProgram (voted ""Most Friendly Sub Community"" by my book).  For advice on how to play the game, try /r/KerbalAcademy.     The game is available at their website, www.Kerbalspaceprogram.com or on Steam. If you would, please consider buying straight from the developer. They are great at listening to the community and could use our support. :) It is currently $40, I believe."

lowendgaming,34nk0v,surikmeetr,2,Sat May 2 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"Toms GPU Hierarchy may be useful.  http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-7.html The GT730 DDR 3 is not a great card - significantly weaker than your HD 5570.  The HD5850 is a much better card and would be a significant upgrade but as you have pointed out it does draw quite a bit of power. I ran a 5850 without problems  for several years on a 500W PSU that had only one six pin connector. I used a molex to six pin connector for the other power input to the card. Molex has slightly lower current capability than six pin but the HD5850 doesn't need the full six pin current.   From googling around it looks like the HD5850 draws just over 150W from the 12V rail so you might be able to sqeeze it into the 450W PSU. Remember though all that power comes from the 12V rail so only the watts on the 12V rail really count."
lowendgaming,34nk0v,Liambp,2,Sat May 2 20:50:14 2015 UTC,"I've dealt almost exclusively in used GPUs. I'm comfortable with them, but I'd suggest you don't buy them from eBay. It's mostly because eBay's prices for used hardware tend to be rather unimpressive.  Consider /r/hardwareswap or GPUshack.com if you're looking at used.  Your power supply is missing those two molex adapters for a reason: it can't provide the amount of power the 12V rail needs.  Unless you want to replace the PSU, stick to cards that don't need any additional power. On the top end, there's the GTX 750 Ti for $120-$150 brand new, usually $100 on /r/hardwareswap. The GTX 650 and Radeon 7750 aren't bad choices, either. $40-$50 for those depending on the day.  The GT 730 has three versions. The 128-bit version is actually a rebadged GT 430, so avoid it."

For example, Bioshock infinite run much better on my 4 GB ram, i5, intel HD 4000 (about 2-3 years old) than it did on my 4 GB, i7, NVIDIA GeForce GT 335M (about 5 years old).

This can only be done after the executable has ran at least once, so;   Launch your game  Close it Open CCC/Switchable graphics (Right Click on the desktop, for me) Enable that game to use high performance Relaunch game Bask in the glory of your GPU rendering things much better than your APU can.    It's also worth noting that you can set CCC to notify you when an application you have ran does not have a switchable graphics setting chosen by you yet, you are alerted when the application is closed. This makes the process I mentioned above a bit quicker."
lowendgaming,34evfd,Viperspider,1 point,Fri May 1 07:24:05 2015 UTC,THIS. But wen't to that window went over to New Vegas (Most of my games don't need optimizing) and it said that it was already on high performance.  However the program was called FalloutNVLauncher. Does that only give the performance to the launcher (if you don't own NV it comes up with a box to edit stuff in) or does that include the game?
lowendgaming,34evfd,Viperspider,1 point,Fri May 1 07:53:36 2015 UTC,"What you could do to ensure that FalloutNV.exe (or whatever) is using High Performance settings (which it probably is, tbh) is go into switchable graphics and manually browse for the actual .exe. If Fallout is anything like Fallout 3, you should have an .exe in there that just launches the game.  Set the game .exe to High Performance and see if it helps.  I haven't looked at your specs in great detail but I can tell you that I have Fallout 3 and I can run it at 1366x768 at pretty high settings, including 4x AA and 4x Anisotropic Filtering at 60fps, so you should be able to get similar performance in New Vegas since they're the same engine, right?

The thing is, your CPU has on it what is called integrated graphics, this is so that computers that have no graphics card can still show pictures/graphics etc on them.   That integrated graphics in the CPU is actually not that good, so you want to use your graphics cards for gaming, because if they use your integrated graphics on the CPU then you will see bad performance.

lowendgaming,34c80n,fllipperrMk2,2,Thu Apr 30 13:59:03 2015 UTC,"I have an AMD C-50 laptop which is 300Mhz weaker than yours but I was able to play 2006-2010 games at choppy but playable framerates while games earlier than that would normally run at smoother framerates on mostly high settings except for horribly optimized games.  Haven't tried Jedi Academy on it but I tried JK2: Jedi Outcast on maxed settings smoothly and sometime i'd play multiplayer with bots in it and it would still be somewhere around ~45fp with some stutter but really playable. Also tried Battlefront 2 on it and it surprisingly runs well but would stutter sometimes when I play with too many bots which is expected because of the weak cpu.  Do you plug it on when you play? Set your power settings to max performance and always update your drivers. RAM speed might also be an issue, I also added 2gb on it which originally had 2gb only and IIRC it was DDR3 clocked at 1333Mhz. If you have something lower than that, performance might not be as good as the Fusion APU's really benefit from faster RAM. Check your CPU and GPU usage when you play and see if they're utilized well."

lowendgaming,34c80n,vonkriegstein,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"I guess yes with AMD. I don't remember the Catalyst Center updating itself hands-free, I always had to double check using an update tool from AMD's site or inside Catalyst Center unlike with NVIDIA where GFE can automatically update itself.  Also tried multibooting different OSes on it so I had Windows 7 originally and added Windows 8.1 and a bunch of linux distros. IIRC, Windows 8.1 would automatically download the latest drivers and updates except some OEM stuff.  But if you say they are normally up to date when you checked, I guess the issue is probably something else. Try monitoring the CPU and GPU usage including the temps. Make sure you set it on max performance. See if there's any anomalies. Last time I tried gaming on that laptop I noticed it wasn't as fast anymore and heats up faster which I assume is caused by the accumulated dust  as I haven't tried cleaning the fans at all for the last 4 years.   One more thing, go to AMD Catalyst Center and check the 3D settings. Try setting it on performance instead of quality and disable stuff like AA."

I heard FS2004 is amazing, and if it was on Steam I would have bought it instead of FSX performance is problematic.  Unfortunately I don't know where to buy FS2003/2004 that isn't relatively expensive.  It simulates commercial flying.  IL–2 Sturmovich is on GoG.  Several games in one, so an amazing value.  Simulates WWII-era combat flying.  MS Train Simulator is considered pretty good.  Independence War simulates space combat with Newtonian physics.  Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries is a very good mech combat game, I'd call it arcade-simulation.  There was a free release done by some company that got permission from MS but imho it's garbage (aside from the bug fixes which weren't really that important), I suggest the original.  Operation Flashpoint is a better military simulation than Ghost Recon."

lowendgaming,33yics,StealthRhino,2,Sun Apr 26 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"My PC specs are in my flair. I have a hard time running ANYTHING well, even if its a 20 year old game. Some of the older games like to stutter on my pc. That said, how does Doom perform with mods? Do I need to pay for Doom to play the mods? Also, how do you recommend to experience the game. It looks fun as hell (literally) and Id like to get in on the action.  EDIT: Also, what is going to be different about v20 over v19?"
lowendgaming,33yics,AkiraZXE,3,Sun Apr 26 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: Buy Doom 2, download Zandronum, move doom2.wad from Doom 2's folder to Zandronum's, download Doomseeker to find games.  So, to start off with, Doom runs great even on older PCs, and only a handful of mods in the great sea of Doom mods will cause issues for lower-end machines. Even if you can't play those, there are an unbelievable number of mods out there. Yes, I highly recommend buying Doom, specifically Doom 2 (but they're all worth playing in their own right). The vast majority of Doom mods use Doom 2 as a base. It's $5 on Steam, and unfortunately I don't know where else to get it. It is possible to substitute Doom 2 with Freedoom, which will work decently for early mods, but I really don't recommend it as it will look like a mess with newer stuff.  The reason you need Doom 2 is a file called doom2.wad, which contains all the assets of Doom. The engine is separate, and which source port you use is really up to you. They exist to make the game more compatible with modern systems (no Dosbox!) and usually add features, anywhere from higher resolutions to high modability. The major ones:   Zandronum is the most popular. It's an advanced multiplayer port with the largest playerbase and the most mod compatibility of all the multiplayer ports. This is my recommendation if you want to play modded Doom online. If you use Zandronum, I suggest using Doomseeker as a server browser rather than the in-engine server browser. If you're interested in Brutal Doom and mods like it, this is also the one to choose. GZDoom is arguably the most advanced Doom port around. Zandronum is based on it. It has all the same features of Zandronum and then some. Some of the most advanced mods will run only on GZDoom. It's focused entirely on singleplayer. My recommendation if you just want to play offline. Brutal Doom specifically also works on this. ZDaemon is a much more classic multiplayer experience. Less mod compatibility, based on an older version of ZDoom than Zandronum was. It has a smaller playerbase that leans more towards classic style mods (levels with no gameplay changes) and PvP gamemodes like deathmatch and CTF. Comes with its own server browser and you have to make an account (doesn't require an email or anything). Doomseeker can also be used to browse ZDaemon servers but I recommend the ZDaemon one. PrBoom isn't as close to the vanilla experience as you can get, but it's the simplest. It's mostly singleplayer.   Once you get Doom 2 and download a source port, all you need to do is move your doom2.wad into the folder with the port, and you're pretty much good to go. How you experience the game is really up to what you want, there's a whole range of mods from just collections of levels to turning Doom into an entirely different game, so you might just want to jump in randomly. The multiplayer ports automatically download the mods you need when you try to join a server. I started playing Doom by just jumping into populated servers. Alternatively, I made a short list here of Doom mods I think are worth checking out. They're all singleplayer, so to play any of these mods, you just drag and drop them onto the port executable.  Since this whole thing started because a link to Brutal Doom, I will say that Brutal Doom typically shows up in some form or another on Zandronum servers, and it is possible to play singleplayer. As for the changes between v20 and v19, I can't actually say I know. I haven't played Brutal Doom in quite a while, it's sort of a weird case in the Doom community that is really popular with all the newer players and none of the guys that have been around for a while.  As for mods, the Doomworld forums, ZDoom forums, and Zandronum forums all have project subforums. Those are the major sources for the newest stuff.  This kind of turned into a wall of text, but lemme know if you run into any problems."

lowendgaming,33yics,AkiraZXE,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:11:16 2015 UTC,"Brutal Doom itself doesn't contain any levels, so vanilla Doom levels. You can play it with any custom levels that don't completely change the game though, most maps won't break."

lowendgaming,33yics,AkiraZXE,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:05:01 2015 UTC,"Ah, ya there are two renderers in both ports. The hardware renderer which uses OpenGL is the more advanced one, with true color and fancy lighting. The way it renders allows you to look up and down with visual issues. GZDoom defaults to this.  The other is the original software renderer. It has to stick to the palette, doesn't have fancy lighting, and uses tricks for vertical freelook, something that isn't otherwise technically possible for the renderer for various reasons. I guess Zandronum defaults to this.  In case you want to play online and want the hardware renderer, you can change it in the menu, options -> set video mode -> renderer: OpenGL."

lowendgaming,33yics,c_t_f,2,Mon Apr 27 13:54:58 2015 UTC,"how does Doom perform with mods?   Depends on how you're running it, and what you're running. 99% of people who play Doom run it with a source port, which there are plenty of. If you're using Windows and want to know for SURE that it'll run just fine, use PrBoom Plus. Otherwise, I'd suggest GZDoom- it can run newer and more technically advanced stuff, I've used it to play Brutal Doom on a Windows ME computer in the past with little to no framerate drops.   Do I need to pay for Doom to play the mods?   Not exactly- there's an awesome project going on by the Doom community called Freedoom which is basically Doom's open source code plus music, art, levels, etc. all made by the community. It might not look or sound like Doom, but it'll play 90% of whatever you throw at it.  (Just a warning though, some mods modify textures and sprites from the original doom game, and unfortunately those tend to be less compatible with Freedoom.)  (Also, each of the original Doom games are five bucks a pop, so if you do decide to get something, get Doom II. Almost all of the mods and level packs nowadays will use Doom II instead of the original)  (One last thing! If you do want to try out Doom without paying for it, the first episode from the first game is available free as shareware. Just Google ""Doom shareware"", download it, run it in a source port or whatever, and see what you think!)   Also, how do you recommend to experience the game   Doom on its own is a very simple and exciting game, and I'd suggest playing it vanilla for a little while at least before trying out any mods. I wouldn't mind if you changed the controls though, by default everything's controlled via keyboard, which isn't everyone's cup of tea for a FPS!   Also, what is going to be different about v20 over v19?   More features, mechanics, etc. Sgt. Mark IV's YouTube channel features a few of them.  I hope that that helps answer your questions!

lowendgaming,33f8fl,dscyrux,3,Wed Apr 22 03:24:03 2015 UTC,Ddidn't even know there was a summoner in Terraria.
lowendgaming,33f8fl,FalseTautology,2,Thu Apr 23 00:41:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, the class was added in 1.2. It takes a while to actually get to that point, though, as you have to get strong enough to explore the jungle and defeat Queen Bee. (Unless you get lucky/grind a lot and find a Slime Staff.)"
lowendgaming,33f8fl,dscyrux,6,Thu Apr 23 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"Tales of Maj'Eyal has a Summoner class, pretty effective too. Your minions aren't permanent, they last for a set number of turns. Summoner minions include hounds, minotaurs, fire-spitting bugs, hydras, and drakes. You'll have to unlock the Summoner, but it's usually pretty quick; just have to encounter any enemy summoner.  There's also a Necromancer, trickier unlock and I'm not that familiar with the class.  Game's available free, too. It's a roguelike, though it has options for extra lives (Adventure mode) or, if you've donated, bought the expansion, or bought it on Steam (functionally treated as a donation), infinite lives (Exploration mode). Heavily combat-based; in a way, it feels kind of like a turn-based Diablo. No potions, in the traditional sense (sidequests give you one-use potions that give permanent benefits), no hunger."
lowendgaming,33f8fl,Thexare,3,Wed Apr 22 03:29:12 2015 UTC,If you can accept roguelikes then in Dungeon Crawl there is also necromancer or summoner class. (Or you can play as orc-jesus and have an private orc army)
lowendgaming,33f8fl,nightblair,3,Wed Apr 22 05:59:39 2015 UTC,End game Terraria has some fun summoner setups. It's still pretty basic.

lowendgaming,33f8fl,chalfont_alarm,3,Thu Apr 23 00:59:43 2015 UTC,"Best Summoner class I've played in an arpg was Path Of Exile. The combinations are just too good! My usual game plan was:   have your zombies/permanent summons attack from the front, since they can absorb more damage, and deal more themselves use a skeleton summoning totem behind the line of enemies to flank them hit them with fireballs or any other spell or ranged attack. or go do something else, they usually don't last long, and your totem will summon more skeletons anyway."
lowendgaming,33f8fl,jonosaurus,3,Wed Apr 22 07:35:58 2015 UTC,"I played one in PoE for quite a while, but ultimately, I found the game too hard.  I can't stand loss of experience mechanics.  The necro in that game was fun, but in most boss fights, the minions would be dust in seconds.   And then the necro folds like a piece of paper."
lowendgaming,33f8fl,nochangelinghere,3,Wed Apr 22 14:47:27 2015 UTC,"I main a summoner in PoE and yeah I feel handicapped against bosses.   Imagine a warrior has tankiness = 1, applied to them. We summoners have tankiness = 1/10 applied to 10 minions. If the boss can do 1/10 damage with an AOE attack, the warrior is down to 9/10, but we are down to 0/10. Minions are useful against non-bosses because the enemy's attack power is also spread out."
lowendgaming,33f8fl,gangler52,3,Wed Apr 22 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup has a necromancer background that plays a bit like the necromancer in Diablo 2.  You quickly learn a skeleton spell that raises a skeleton out of a corpse. So if you kill a rat you can bring back a rat skeleton.  Later on you can learn a Zombie spell that works similarly, but the summons are a bit stronger and it works on the corpses of boneless creatures.  The advantages of this over the Summoner's summons is that there's no limit on how many zombies or skeletons you can amass, and they stick around forever, though they can't follow you onto other floors. The Summoner for example might summon imps, but only 3 at a time, and they'll disappear after a set time.  Though both the Summoner and the Necromancer can get a lot done with their armies of minions."
lowendgaming,33f8fl,Olpainless,3,Wed Apr 22 08:40:48 2015 UTC,"Can't go without mentioning Titan Quest! I play exactly the same way as you OP, even in Skyrim I did!   In Titan Quest I'd usually have 4 different minions summoned, and I'd spend my time buffing and healing them really.  It's an even better game to play with others, which if you got Gameranger you could do :)   There's also Dragon Age Origins of course, which you'll be surprised how even crap computers can play it just fine."
lowendgaming,33f8fl,Olpainless,2,Wed Apr 22 15:29:00 2015 UTC,What build would you recommend for the ultimate summoner?
lowendgaming,33f8fl,Kardlonoc,3,Wed Apr 22 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"For Titan Quest? Well that's kinda the beauty of it, there's multiple ways!   See, you choose two ""classes"", and within the classes themselves you can specialise by going down certain branches.   So for example, Earth has some great summoning, but it it also has a spell that with the right other skills can turn you into an insane DPS machine.   There's actually tons if guides so that you can pick exactly what type of summoner you want to be (the community is still pretty massive even after all these years).   And on top of your class summons, you can buy summoning scrolls to summon other things too!"
lowendgaming,33f8fl,Vrachos,2,Thu Apr 23 05:36:59 2015 UTC,"In dungeon siege and dungeon siege 2 you can recruit up to I think 8 party members in dungeon siege and 6 in dungeon siege 2. Dungeon siege 2 is more polished and has a better story.   You can play any of the party members at any time, but you can stick with a summoner type class/ healer and let the npcs do all the work.   Its a very rare formula in Action RPG's to have a big party and it definitely emulates D2 skeleton party action."
lowendgaming,33f8fl,surikmeetr,2,Wed Apr 22 09:10:03 2015 UTC,"Would you mind a strategy game? Vantage Master Online is basically summoner duels. You both summon minions and they go at each other until one master overwhelms the other. You have to command all your minions, but the master just stays in the back summoning and casting spells.

The 520M barely holds up to Intel HD 3000, and the 610M is similar with Intel HD 4000.  I don't think he'll be getting something capable of PS2 emulation, but I'd suggest looking for APUs. Get familiar with their models, because you want a 35W part, not the 19W ones that came in cheaper models.  Look for the A8-4500M and the A10-4600M. A10-5750M if possible. Ignore almost all of the rest. Ignore anything below A8. A4 and A6 are to be avoided. Don't touch any AMD processor that doesn't end with a zero. Don't touch anything branded as Phenom or Athlon; those are long out of date. I think APUs are your best shot because of how budget-oriented they are.  Don't touch any Intel processor whose model ends with the letter ""U."" Look for ""M"" or ""QM"" at the end. Swing for Sandy or Ivy Bridge era architecture if possible; these will be 2XYZ or 3XYZ models. Of course, a strong processor won't be very useful unless it has a good GPU.  Try for a GT 630M, maybe up to the 650M if possible. Also the GT 540M, GT 730M (the 720M is too close to HD 4400 to worry about), IGNORE the 820M because it's basically a 720M but DO GET the 825M if you see one.

Note that, others have mentioned, you may need to replace the power supply unit or PSU on your old machine, if you had any.

lowendgaming,325fev,Jannaeus_Sulla,2,Fri Apr 10 18:58:51 2015 UTC,Make sure you are running on a power outlet w/ High Performance enabled in the battery settings.  That is as far as you will get.
lowendgaming,325fev,Orangematz,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:44:01 2015 UTC,You have a decent processor with poor integrated graphics so the first thing you need to do is go into the options graphics menu and choosing low quality and see if you can get a playable frame rate. There is an advanced graphics option that gives you more fine control so it might be possible to get a compromise between quality and frame-rate.   If the game isn't playabe even at low quality then you can try lowering the screen resolution. It will make everything look worse but it will give a handy boost in frame rate.  If playing with graphics settings still doesn't give you an improvement then there may be one hardware trick you can do.  check if your laptop has a single 8Gb memory stick and whether or not it is possible to add a second 8Gb stick Integrated graphics shares memory with your CPU and benefits significantly from dual channel memory which needs two identical memory sticks. However many Laptop manufacturers only put  a single memory stick in to save cost.   Don't forget that regardless of graphics performance all total war games have longish loading times and also take a long time to process the AI factions when you press the end turn button. Improving graphics will not affect this.
lowendgaming,325fev,Liambp,1 point,Sat Apr 11 08:42:40 2015 UTC,"Isn't the 8GB plenty enough? I think 16GB would be overkill for that laptop but it's still a good upgrade though. Also, isn't there a limit with how much memory is dynamically shared with the integrated graphics?"
lowendgaming,325fev,vonkriegstein,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:22:58 2015 UTC,8Gb is more than enough but if it is only a single stick of memory it won't allow dual channel mode. You need two identical sticks side by side to get dual channel. It may be he has two 4Gb sticks and is already getting dual channel but a surprising number of laptops save money by giving you a single big stick rather than two smaller ones.   Dual channel mode is particularly important for integrated graphics systems because ram is shared between CPU and GPU. Dual channel Ram helps them share the memory more efficiently. Here is a Youtube video showing how running dual channel can give gain from 20% to 25% in Rome II Total war on HD4000 graphics.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMCvvtaZ5Z0

lowendgaming,31uaah,javoll,21,Wed Apr 8 05:06:21 2015 UTC,"Ugh, not for $150. Core 2 Duo machines should be squarely in the $60-$120 price range now. $150 should get you at least an old i3/i5/i7 at this point. eBay even has i5 laptops for $120. If you can bump up to the $200 range, you can start looking at chips like the AMD A8-4500M, which is a massive leg-up on any of these machines. Of course, that doesn't fit the budgets of most people here.  Business laptops are my favorite laptops to recommend because of how cheap and reliable they can be (happy HP 2560P owner here, and a Dell E6410 before that), but I'm relatively sure this is just Woot dumping off mostly C2D machines. There are a lot of unsold Dell D-series out there.  On another note, the HP Stream 7 in the Microsoft store is running an Atom quad core and is only $80 for a brand new device running a full Windows OS.  Another suggestion: pay attention to the old desktops that show up on Newegg and the like. An old Dell for $80. You could throw GPU in there for $40-$80 and see a very appreciable gain in performance, though you'd be limited to half-height GPUs. Or even better, an old full size for $95."

lowendgaming,31bqcr,Von_Baron,2,Fri Apr 3 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"Not all of them are low-end friendly tho :/  Still, thanks anyway! :D"
lowendgaming,31bqcr,poomcgoo8,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"And a Lot of games that support controllers are not listed as such in steam.  In order for steam to list a game as having ""full controller support,"" it must support the controller 100% from game launch to game close.  So if a game includes controller support but has a launcher that you must control via mouse, it will either list as ""partial controller support"" or will not be tagged as supporting controllers at all.  I have at least 10 games in my library that support controllers natively yet do not mention controllers anywhere on steam.  Edit: for example, none of my uplay titles list controller support in steam last I checked, but not only do all of my uplay titles fully support controllers (many of which designed specifically for them), but even uplay itself supports controllers for launching games and such."

lowendgaming,313aua,oridjinn,5,Wed Apr 1 18:35:51 2015 UTC,I would go for an AMD Kaveri APU system  A8-7600 APU  4Gb of fairly good dual channel ram.  Suitable motherboard with spare PCI-E slot.  The Kaveri integrated beats any integrated graphics that Intel can offer and can play almost all modern games at medium settings. If the user wants to upgrade later they can get a new graphics card. this APU will bottleneck a high end graphics card but who puts a high end card into a budget machine? A realistic upgrade would be a mid range card which would give a nice performance boost.   Some games are beginning to bust the 4Gb llimit but those are not games you would expect to play on a budget machine. Put in 8Gb if memory is cheap but don't put in slow ram or you will hamper the APU performance.
lowendgaming,313aua,Liambp,2,Thu Apr 2 15:35:44 2015 UTC,That is a nice idea. I will look into it for sure.    I am also looking for something weaker. I want to test how far I can push a weak system.

lowendgaming,313aua,Paladin8,5,Sun Apr 19 02:36:06 2015 UTC,"""Realistically used by a wide array of people"" is the key phrase here. I'd go with a system made of low-end components of the current hardware generation and one made of low-end components from two generations ago or so.  Current gen:  Intel Pentium G3220 (3Ghz) Intel HD 4000 Graphics (included) ASRock H87 Pro4 Mainboard (my own mainboard, bought because it's easily upgradable) 4 GB of DDR3-1333 RAM (2x2GB for dual channel) Some SATA-600 HDD @ 7200rpm  This set-up costs around 200$ and barely ran current games. Intel HD 4600 is quite a bit faster, but the CPUs are also a lot more expensive. Faster RAM might make a difference, but the G3220's memory control chip doesn't support anything above 1333, anyway.  For the lower end machine I'd use:  Core 2 Duo ~ 2.4 Ghz Mainboard with a GMA X4500HD integrated GPU 2 GB of DDR2-800 RAM (2x1GB for dual channel again) Some SATA-150 HDD @ 7200rpm  This isn't as low-end as some people on this sub go, but those are configurations you might actually see in some numbers in the wild, I think. If you want to go lower (or wouldn't mind including a third setup) you could try to mimic netbooks, with slower HDDs and single-core or low-clocked CPUs."
lowendgaming,313aua,LFKhael,3,Thu Apr 2 00:20:15 2015 UTC,"This is some excellent info.    I like the Core 2 Duo system the best. I think GMA X4500 is a great GPU to test, probably the lowest video card that is going to play most new games these days.    I do want to go even lower. For fun also.  I am looking into an original Acer netbook i may use... But MAN this thing is slow even to run windows, let alone try games."

I bought an Asus TransformerBook packing a Z3775 under the hood and was blown away that it can play source games on low settings with 40+FPS average. On a friggin' tablet. Plus anything 2D was a cake walk. I also tried a 7"" ""WinBook"" which was too constrained by memory to be useful for anything 3D, despite sharing the same family of processor (Z3735F). E atom option is nice because there is a fixed ceiling to the cost of the device (you aren't adding any hardware at all to a notebook or tablet) while it sets the baseline for Intel's current offerings. Literally any other machine will be more powerful.   When capturing, you will want a hardware capture device, if trying to screen cap legacy or low end hardware. The frames will suffer too much from ANY software solution to offer any meaningful benchmark results.   PM me if you want help with sampling and creating material.

lowendgaming,30twaq,cardfire,3,Mon Mar 30 19:57:42 2015 UTC,"Worth mentioning, the graphics processor for your low-end gaming rig is the single most important component for actually playing 3D games of any sort.   I would strongly recommend looking at the price of that 610 GT and finding any equivalently priced parts used, On eBay or on craigslist. For example, I would list my spare GT 9800 for 20 bucks on CL, and that can literally double the performance of the 610 GT.   Heck, you would be better off with a three years old IGP such as an Intel HD 4000. Obviously, that won't work for the C2D Optiplex machine you're working with right now. But you get the idea. This link demonstrates all three GPU's mentioned.    At any rate, good luck out there.

These 2 actually do LIGHTING & Shadows:  fInteriorShadowDistance=3000.0000  fShadowDistance=8000.0000  So, if you would like to turn off lighting and shadows set:  iShadowMapResolution=0  fInteriorShadowDistance=0  fShadowDistance=0  NEXT  Also in skyrimPrefs.ini you'll see an entry iPresentInterval=0 (or 1)  This entry is in the wrong ini file and regardless of whether its =0 or =1, it has no effect here.  It should be deleted from skyrimPrefs.ini altogether (then save) for the next step to work.  Now open skyrim.ini and add the line iPresentInterval=0 under the [Display] group.

I doubt that lowering the graphics settings is the issue. I suspect some incompatibility with modern hardware. Here are a few things you could try:  1) Try running it on a single processor core. While the game is running CTL-ALT-Del task manager. find the programme process right click on it and untick all CPU cores except 1. Some older games actually get confused if you have multiple cores.  2) Try the various windows compatibility modes: right click on the desktop icon for the game. Go to properties - compatibility and play around with the various settings. Windows XP mode is probably the best for a game of this age. 3) the gog.com forums suggest a mod called circle of eight to fix bugs in the game.

lowendgaming,30oeml,JustAPunyMortal,6,Sun Mar 29 06:04:18 2015 UTC,I think yor machine is too low end for the game. DOTA is well optimized and far less demanding than Borderlands and if you can't run that well I don't think there's too much hope.  At this point have you thought of maybe picking up a ps3 or 360 to play all the good cross platforms you've been missing out on? Getting a used console and the games is pretty cheap now. Plus playing games that look and run well on a console is much better than muddy textures and low fps on an old computer.

You can save-scum to your heart's content as well (saving and loading to get a preferable outcome in RNG based actions).    It's half action-based, but you may want to try Recettear.

Your CPU will probably do ""ok"" but it is getting old, and will start showing it's age soon. However upgrading this will also necessitate upgrading your motherboard to an LGA1150 compliant board.  If at all possible, bump to 8GB of RAM. This will give you a nice cushion for multitasking, and given how little RAM you have currently you may even see a speed increase on your machine depending on the task being performed.   As for GPU, that will depend entirely on what settings you want, and what your budget for parts happens to be."

Then I updated the Microsoft drivers from Device Manager using the above method but chose the new Intel drivers (the entire folder) when prompted to browse for the files. It seems to have worked? My version for the Intel drivers is now 10.18.14.4156, and the driver date is March 3."

lowendgaming,2zpq99,ekeen1,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:02:02 2015 UTC,Will it update my Intel 4600?
lowendgaming,2zpq99,stealer0517,2,Fri Mar 20 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, That's what I have.  Went in CS:GO from 95-98 FPS to a steady 115-120 with my Core i7-4710HQ."
lowendgaming,2zq3zg,Advanced-,3,Fri Mar 20 18:17:46 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a 750 Ti or whatever GPU your PSU will allow you to consider. While an C2Q is quite dated these days, 4 threads and 4GB of RAM will still carry you pretty far.  You could also pick up the 750 Ti as a stand-in while you save up for other new parts. The 750 Ti would also be the single biggest performance improvement you could make on what you currently have. You'd be looking at approximately a 4x increase in FPS on games, assuming the GPU is your primary limiting factor, which it generally is.  I wouldn't worry about upgrading within your socket. Get the GPU first, then save up for a modern CPU+RAM+Mobo. A new PSU would probably be another thing worth considering, depending on what you're currently using.   Seeing as the GTS 250 uses a 6-pin aux power connector, you could look at an R9 270 or GTX 960, too."
lowendgaming,2zq3zg,LFKhael,2,Fri Mar 20 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"Amazingly and trust me I have NO IDEA on HOW this thing runs at all.... I ended up buying the GTS 250 without realizing how bad my PSU was back then and just stuck it in their, hoping for the best.  I am using a 300 Watt PSU. This was originally a pre-built Dell with a 256 MB AMD card and a core 2 duo + 2 GB of ram (2007 Computer).  The GTS 250 requires a 450 Watt PSU (What the box on it said) but has been running with whatever brand Dell uses and 300 Watts.  Part of the reason I wanted the 750 Ti and the Q9550 is because they both take less power and thus would probably give my really old computer some extra life.  I have already had 2 USB ports short out, 2 ram slots causing BSOD's, 1 Sata port on the MOBO stop working entirely all within the last 2 years. I'm thinking a lot of those could be due to the PSU issue and the fact I am constantly pushing these parts to their limits with my gaming.   Seeing as the GTS 250 uses a 6-pin aux power connector, you could look at an R9 270 or GTX 960, too.   Considering all the above, I'd rather not :)  Also the CPU upgrade I wanted would be purely for CS:GO. I get 120 FPS on my laptop that has a intel HD 4600 with a i7-4710HQ.  I get a maximum FPS of 70 on my desktop no matter if the settings are very high or low. My CPU just is not good enough to play CS:GO at a competitive level which is why I actually play CS:GO on my laptop now a days and all other games on my Desktop.  And I know its my CPU because of the laptop thing and the fact raising my AA from 0 to 4x doesn't change my FPS on CS:GO at all, it might drop 3-4 fps more but most of the time it's the same. But again it's only for CS:GO, on all other games my bottleneck is typically my GTS 250."

My real question is really how much of an upgrade would I be getting and how much does my ram limit me?

lowendgaming,2zq3zg,aura_enchanted,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:16:30 2015 UTC,"Everything there could be considered a bottleneck except for the HDD, that is alright. Since swapping RAM for DDR3 would imply getting a new motherboard, I'd upgrade the GPU first, trying to get something reasonable right now (R9 280? 750Ti would do but won't last more than a few years IMO). Not being able to overclock might be limiting you more, since the Q6600 is already a damn fine CPU. Check LinusTechTips' Scrapyard Wars series to see a build similar to yours. However IF you could get a reasonable upgrade... 4GB of DDR3, the Gigabyte G41MT-S2PT motherboard and a 750Ti would cost you around $240 (Amazon price), around $270 if you add a CM Hyper Evo 212 cooler. You would balance the build perfectly that way, and you could use the RAM, cooler and GPU on a newer build later. Your call."
lowendgaming,2zq3zg,skinnyowner,1 point,Fri Mar 20 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"Upgrade time man, I'd do the cpu ram and motherboard next all in one shot to like a neahelm or a piledriver if your wanting to save money and are okay with used parts.  If you want to buy new then I'm out of the loop sorry but don't settle for less than a core i5 even though the i3's are leagues better than your cpu because going from a quad to a dual is very foolish.  Stay at 8GB ram you won't feel it after 10GB anyway and at 12gb+ you start to lose frames anyway (not much but it does happen I think the most I ever saw was 5 fps at 16gb on cryengine 3.5 (crysis 2 & 3).  Tbh though your biggest limiting factor here is the gpu in reality the cpu is actually still good enough to game most of the time. Many system requirements are now ment specifically to push contract deals with parts manufacturers they have deals with. A modern console is basically a graphics card from your gpu's hayday glued to a pair of modern smartphones.  As for more specific things to work with don't upgrade to anything weaker than a gtx 760 or r7 series as you really won't feel the differences much your basically at that point tossing out one for another really.  And cpu wise anything in 4 cores is better than what you currently poses in some form or another.  And yeah upgrade the power supply its time to do right and retire your psu and by the sounds of it the chassis too don't worry cheap ones can be had for about 40 bucks (case). Don't pay less than that insist if the guys at the store or wherever you buy push a cheaper product."

lowendgaming,2z97ce,theredbaron1834,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, this entire time I have been talking about windows embedded posready 2009, which is a version of xp sp3 made for cash registers. It just left regular support in January, and has extended support (the kind that ended for regular xp last year) until April of 2019."
lowendgaming,2z97ce,theredbaron1834,0,Mon Mar 16 22:48:24 2015 UTC,"This is so true. However, it is very insecure now. There are some things you can do to make it better, but as MS is no longer giving any updates, XP is nothing but a time bomb now.  Also, if your game is supported by Wine, I have found I can get more fps out of a well set up linux install. And by well set up, I mean next to nothing else installed :). Not a default Ubuntu isntall, as ugh, that will take a bunch of FPS.  It isn't the best, but it is ""safer"".  If it isn't, do like I do. A windows XP install with no wifi drivers. Hard to get virus's if you can't get online."

Vista and up have a .wim file that consists of a root fs, like squashfs on linux distros. My lappy's crap speed combined with thousands of 2kb files led to the nightmare."

lowendgaming,2z3y2x,vonkriegstein,2,Sun Mar 15 18:59:35 2015 UTC,To start of you should try and play roguelikes that have tilesets (Cataclysm has one). Eventually you'll move onto the supreme ASCII interface once you get used to tiles.
lowendgaming,2z3y2x,vonkriegstein,2,Sun Mar 15 19:05:50 2015 UTC,I could handle simple graphics but not that simple as ASCII though.
lowendgaming,2z3y2x,vonkriegstein,1 point,Mon Mar 16 11:18:39 2015 UTC,"I felt exactly the same way and after about 3 years of playing roguelikes with tiles I greatly prefer ASCII because its faster to run, clearer to see and helps you to imagine the action more."

On the above spec I was able to play Morrowind with steady framerate, as well as emulation up to PS1/N64. Halo CE was ever so slightly out of reach for me on the lowest settings.

lowendgaming,2yyti6,Cursing_Akhenaten,6,Fri Mar 13 23:45:43 2015 UTC,No. Sorry man.
lowendgaming,2yyti6,I_Rike_Reddit,3,Fri Mar 13 23:59:29 2015 UTC,Theres an ultra low graphics mod for skyrim you could use that.
lowendgaming,2yyti6,Chipjacket,3,Sat Mar 14 05:17:48 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else has said, probably not. If you did get it to run, it'd be really shitty framerate.   There's a mod here called the Ultra Low Graphics Mod that should make it run just fine on that set up if you can deal with the extremely low-res graphics. IMO it's actually a nice aesthetic.  Here's a video of it in action.  Oblivion should run fine without any tinkering."
lowendgaming,2yyti6,dat_username_tho,2,Sat Mar 14 09:59:32 2015 UTC,Here's the game being played on a $100 HP Stream 7.  Same GPU as your laptop.
lowendgaming,2yyti6,LFKhael,2,Sat Mar 14 03:51:02 2015 UTC,That's pretty impressive. If that was tweaked that could probably be around ~25 or maybe ~30 fps.
