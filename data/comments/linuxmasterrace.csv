I've only ever lost data once while logged as root. Or twice. Maybe 3 times. Whatever. (and no, I don't log as root)  Here is why it doesn't matter that much: the most important data is in your user home anyway. My config files on /etc? It doesn't matter. A new system will leave behind some cruft anyway. Hundreds of bloated files at /usr? A mild inconvenience at best. I can restore with one command. But rm -r * at your home is usually a bigger disaster - removing from / might as well start removing from outside your home, giving you a chance to Ctrl+C. So you should ALWAYS be careful while at the terminal, because every mistake may delete important stuff.  But here's another, more fundamental reason it doesn't matter: you should have backups. If you don't have backups, it's not a matter of whether you will lose data, but when.  By the way, that's why the traditional Unix security model isn't that useful for single-user machines. Root can do some things your regular user can't, but... your user can do plenty of damage on its own."
