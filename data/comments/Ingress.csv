It's against the spirit of the game, but it's not going to get you banned or something.     If you and your niece see each other a lot, you might want to encourage her to change factions. It's difficult to Ingress together with family/friends on opposite factions. For example, if you are going around destroying blue things for her to capture, that is called ""win-trading"" and that will get you banned. Or at least potentially shunned by the local communities. However, if you play on the same side, you can go out farming, attacking, building, fielding, etc., together."

Ingress,3dzyib,tantouz,12,Mon Jul 20 22:20:08 2015 UTC,"Afaik not, they supply you with a few items and are freely shared. there was a topic with never dead passcodes, but they`re dead. Note for those who can't get them to work, sometimes there is an invisible trailing space. Items are from L1 to L4 and a few mods.

Ingress,3dzyib,sublimoon,5,Tue Jul 21 06:59:13 2015 UTC,"Passcodes are one of the oldest things in ingress. They are made to be discovered decoding documents and images, but once somebody discover one, it gets shared a lot. So ingress introduced a maximum number of redeeming for each (I don't know if it's still this way now). They got fully redeemed very fast, and decode ingress was born as a place to share it.  Once they were much more relevant, with useful high level items and rare objects. A relevant part of one's inventory could be made of objects from passcodes. Then ingress shifted more towards hacking portals, and a huge number of portal popped up anywhere."
Ingress,3dzyib,sza_rak,4,Tue Jul 21 09:35:22 2015 UTC,"@sublimoon  The high value keys (L5-L8 stuff) still have limited usage value, the codes listed here seem to be long term and unlimited, though they only deliver Items from L1-L4 and Mods.

You really need to plan ahead for a particular style of play. Want to make some layered fields? Then stock just enough bursters to clear and farm keys strategically. Need recharger badge? Hack all the things and stock up on tons of keys. Want to load up on ap and piss off the opposition? Load up on bursters and blow up farms every day. Each one of these tasks resumes some pre planning though.

The scanner and NIA's servers just facilitate the interaction between the community members, be it on the same or opposite factions.  Solo play does not give you much satisfaction apart maybe from the leveling up process. But after level 8, when leveling slows down, it's how you play (in benefit of your faction) that gives you constant satisfaction. Regardless of wether you participate in major operations or just play in your area recapturing and fielding. Every field counts, every item hacked, it's all for the faction (or more like for your new friends you've made that also play ingress)."

Sounds like you have a challenge. If you're last hack is Friday noon then you'd need one on Saturday before noon. If you know you can't hack again until Sunday 3pm then you'd want a second Saturday hack after 3pm.

There are confirmed reports by many people who have hacked between 24 and ~30 hours apart and didn't lose their badge. Like /u/I_work_in_marketing said, though - it's completely random whether you'll get lucky enough for that to happen to you, so I wouldn't trust my badge to it (given the choice)."

(long press the hack button)  If you get better at glyph hacking, you'll definitely yield more items.  For example, a successful 5-glyph hack on a level 8 portal can get you up 10-20 items.  Level 7 and level 8 portals are really needed to get the level 8 items.    Your best bet is to hook up with other players when they do a farm (turn a small area into all level 8 portals) and then you can spend some time glyph hacking and stocking up."
Ingress,3dys5m,Spritzertog,7,Mon Jul 20 17:14:30 2015 UTC,I started glyph hacking but I am terrible at memorizing the patterns in such little time given to do so. I usually get only one of them.
Ingress,3dys5m,Spritzertog,18,Mon Jul 20 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"It really is just a matter of practice.  The patterns repeat themselves, so you'll get used to seeing them again and again.  http://www.ingress.tv/5-glyph-hack-sequences.html  Even one successful glyph helps your total.  So .. if you can't memorize all 5, at least try to remember the first two .. and then first three.. etc.  Each glyph correct adds to your total, so it doesn't hurt to get some wrong.  Lastly - there are some glyph practice apps out there.  I never did those, but I know people who have."

Ingress,3dys5m,pseudopsud,11,Tue Jul 21 12:27:58 2015 UTC,"Practice practice practice. I used to suuuuck at glyphing. Then I made a point of practicing, and now I can get the speed bonus on L8 portals more often than not. It does make a huge difference.  I liked practicing on the MemoGlyph app. Others like Glypher. Both are pretty good and will let you practice actual sequences, or just look up/practice individual glyphs.   Also, pay attention to the opposites. Attack/defend, create/destroy, advance/retreat, less/more, etc.   There are also related glyphs. Mind, body, and soul all add up to make human. Strong is a rectangle, like a strong box- weak is a table with a broken leg that couldn't hold up anything. Lie is an incomplete truth. Past, present, and future are the same shape, just pointed in different directions (past is to the left, future to the right, and present points to you now). Old and new are both just short little lines, but old is on the ""past"" side (the left) and new is on the ""future"" side (the right). The glyphs actually start making sense once you notice all these things, which makes them WAY easier to remember.   Then of course once you know the words, the sequences become little sentences. Sentences are easier for the brain to remember than just a random sequence of shapes.   So yeah, keep practicing :)"

Ingress,3dys5m,Thanlis,2,Tue Jul 21 06:59:36 2015 UTC,"It really helps to know the actual names because the sequences make sentences or sentence-like structure. My success rate increased considerably once I knew the actual symbol names.

Ingress,3dys5m,jeopardydd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:03:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about that. If your brain had hardware support for English syntax, you'd expect every language to share the same syntactical structure, and they don't. Subject-verb order isn't even in the majority.  I mastered glyph hacking by choosing words that describe the glyphs for me; I'd argue that for people like me, it's important to create the tight link between word and symbol. I suspect that visual learners are going to do better with my method, while verbal learners are going to do better using the official names. Kinetic learners may want to use the glyph trainers.  I have a 95%+ success rate on P8s. My best advice is to try different methods of learning if the first one doesn't work for you."

Ingress,3dys5m,jeopardydd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:14:23 2015 UTC,"Your brain has ""hardware support"" for remembering these kinds of sequences   Possibly, but it's not like all the glyph sequences form grammatically correct sentences either, so you're not really much better off remembering a random 5-item sequence.  The trade-off with the above is now you have to remember a hundred or so glyphs, many of which do not bear any relation to the shape of the glyph itself. Is it easier to memorize 100 things long-term, or 5 things short-term? The latter is easier. Therefore, the better approach is to devise your own mnemonics for each glyph, because that helps with the bigger problem, which is remembering 100 different glyphs."
Ingress,3dys5m,madchains,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"Learn the real names.   The human brain is much better at remembering ""sentences"" instead of random strings of words that don't fit together."

Just practice on lower level portals, cause then you only get 2-4 glyphs to remember. For some of them I remember the name the game uses but for some glyphs I made up my own little names which helps to remember.   For example, the ""human"" glyph is known as ""shield"" in my head, so as the glyphs come out I might think to myself ""little triangle, shield, shapers, backwards L"" instead of trying to remember them all with the proper name.  Hope this helps a little."
Ingress,3dys5m,spectrumero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:22:34 2015 UTC,Being terrible at something is the first step towards being kinda good at it.

Ingress,3dys5m,Fischtreu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"After each glyph hack, look at the words the symbols mean and try to remember the right word for each symbol. Many are quite easy since they are ""opposite"" of the other.  All the glyph sequences make short sentences (or sentence like structures). Your brain has ""hardware support"" for remembering sentence-like sequences really easily. Once you know even just half the names for the symbols your success rate will become quite high. I think there are apps for helping you learn but to be honest, it's just as easy to learn by actually glyph hacking."

In other words, the farther you progress in the game, the more you need to rely on your fellow players.    Granted - if you're in an area without many other players, this is problematic.  But the aspect of the game I enjoy the most is the social aspect."
Ingress,3dys5m,ARedditorCalledQuest,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:02 2015 UTC,"I live on an island, we have probably only a dozen active players (and most on the other team) and being on an island, we don't even get any pass-through traffic.  Since Ingress started, our team has never had an L8 portal except one made by Jarvis/ADA. The other team occasionally gets an L8 portal by 8 players deploying.  I basically never deplay L8 resonators unless it can get a portal to L7 or is likely to get a portal to L7 - otherwise I run out. The drop rate of L8 resos from L7 portals is also pretty low, it's rare that deploying an L8 on a portal to get it to L7 gives me a return on investment because the other side smashes the portal before it does (and over time I slowly run out completely of L8 resos)."
Ingress,3dys5m,kuvter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:07:43 2015 UTC,the good news is that you don't need many L8 items (particularly bursters) if you are in an area without too many players and therefore you are not taking down opposing 8-farms.

The first green L8 I hacked was sometime in the second month at a flash farm where I was literally the 8th person. L7 portals were rare back then in my area, I mostly used L6 and L5 gear when leveling from L5 through to L9. For the first 2.5 months, I considered 30 L8 XMPs to be a huge number. It wasn't till we started doing multiple flash farms per week for Shonin that I had anything over 100. I came back from that with 1200 and started solo killing the local blue mega farm (60+ portal sorta driving loop) that had been standing 9+ months before I started playing. Because I got so accustomed to only having a few L8s, I farm about every 2 weeks to recoup net losses. Glyphing random portals gives me about 60% of my daily usage."

Fully charged L8 will give the best return on the time investment."

Ingress,3dys5m,ChaoticUnreal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:42:27 2015 UTC,Portals always have a change of giving +-2 portal level gear.  Any gear lower than 1 gets turned into level 1 gear and any gear higher than 8 gets turned into level 8 gear.  Charge level has nothing to do with it.
Ingress,3dys5m,Recyart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:13:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I keep level 4 portals around because I'm always in need of L4 resonators.

Ingress,3dys5m,jeopardydd,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:02 2015 UTC,the best way to get level 4 resonators is to hack them while building ( 8 7 6 6 5 5 glyph hack 4 4) you will most likely end up getting 3-4 each time. Apophenia is a hell of a thing

Or those that might have been upgraded by one other player so P6. Even a P7 is rare.  I do get some L8 gear by glyph hacking the P6's that I do have. If I want lots of L8 gear I have to go to the local city farm, which I don't do very often.  However I've gotten good at taking down portals with level 5 bursters."
Ingress,3dys5m,jeopardydd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:45 2015 UTC,"Almost everyone seems to have more R7s than R8s due to the game mechanics and the relative abundance of P7's compared to P8's (and R7s can still drop from P8's)  I'd say just keep hacking as you normally do but glyph hack the P7 and P8s if possible.  Also, you might see a ton of L1 portals with a single R8 deployed (sometimes just to capture the portal.)  I usually single deploy my R7's instead of R8's now if I don't have time to do a full deploy.  If you want to fully deploy, go with 7-6-6-5-5-4-4-4 (or replace one of the 4's with a 3) for a L5 portal instead of doing 8-7-6-6-5-5-4-4.  I only use my R8's to upgrade existing portals and only if it makes a difference in upgrading the portal's final level."

If the goal is to level you up your friends should stop firing before the fields go down and let you finish solo (and maybe go farm keys for you so you can refield the area).

And if that doesn't work (especially if the other faction has someone who can access it), just be aware of its existence and block accordingly.  It goes without saying, however, that there are a few inaccessible bogus portals.  (E.g., someone's decorative coffee cup conveniently becoming a desk portal)  The bogus ones definitely should be reported and removed."
Ingress,3e1xdk,radwolf76,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"The reason it's not being spoken about is because it's perfectly within the rules to have portals in places the public isn't generally allowed, as long as it is not residential."

Ingress,3e0l1d,vektorDex,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:01 2015 UTC,"I do this regularly now, I have finally managed to keep my L4 count high enough that I run out. But still keep lower res just in case."

Ingress,3e0l1d,giveer,4,Tue Jul 21 01:16:54 2015 UTC,"It's not so much an option as it is simply hacking the portal before you deploy all of your resonators. If you deploy all 8, you make an L5 portal. Just stop before deploying your last 2 resonators and glyph hack it first."
Ingress,3e0l1d,SonOfWisdom,4,Tue Jul 21 03:16:10 2015 UTC,L1-L4 are all the same in my book.
Ingress,3e0l1d,Paulrik,4,Tue Jul 21 04:33:51 2015 UTC,Consider that you can only deploy one L7 resonator on a portal at a time. I would recycle some of those to free up some inventory space.
Ingress,3e0l1d,hpizzy,3,Tue Jul 21 02:46:49 2015 UTC,"Depending on your play style and how much time you have to play.   Here is my formula for 2hrs of play time with a balanced destroy and build.   80 lv7 + 80 lv8 reso 120 lv 6 reso 40 lv 5 - keep these low since a fully deployed portal is lv5 80 lv 4  700—busters   Rest of inventory, ultra strikes, mods and keys   This allows me to easily destroy 50+ well shielded portals followed by full deploy and an additional 30 single deploy for uniques.   All the while throwing small links and fields results in a massive amount of ap within 2 hrs. Also prior to playing I select a location that has a large cluster of portals that are in enemy control and fielded."
Ingress,3e0l1d,Spritzertog,3,Tue Jul 21 04:19:16 2015 UTC,"Just re-iterating what others have said:  It depends on your play style.  I'm in a very portal dense area, and I tend to both capture and upgrade a lot .. therefore I actually like to have 200+ L7 and L8 resos at all times.  I can easily go through 100 or more in my lunch hour.  (I currently have about 300 of each).   However, If I have more L7's than 8s, then I recycle the excess 7s.  (7s are easier to get, generally.)    I've found 6s are the hardest to get .. level 6 portals are like a sweet spot of portals because it takes two people to make one, but a 3rd person (or more) makes a L7 portal.  So .. you can't get them by yourself, but they're easily pushed to 7s.  4s, 5s, and 6s, you will go through twice as fast because of the deploy amounts.  4s and 5s are easy to get, though.  Fully deploy a portal, and glyph hack -- you get 5s.   If you need lower than 5s, then you glyph while you deploy.  I prefer deploying like this:  8, 7, 6, 6, 5, 5, <glyph hack> 4, 4  Typically one glyph hack like that will give me enough for a couple of full deploys.  I rarely maintain a stock of lower level resos  Another tip though:  If you are working towards your builder badge, then you will want the lower level resos.  That way you can deploy all 1s first, then upgrade 2s, then 3s, then 4s, etc etc etc until your fully max deployed.  That will give you more credit towards builder.  (this only works if you are upgrading your own deploys .. doesn't work if you upgrade other people's resos.)"
Ingress,3e0l1d,PuckStar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for that last tip. Didn't know that!
Ingress,3dzglt,LavingRunatic,7,Mon Jul 20 19:59:05 2015 UTC,Make fields!! The most AP you are going to find is in field making.    In terms of AP:  Hack a portal- 100 AP. Snore. Place a resonator- 125 AP. Boring. Make a field- 1250 AP. Woot!   Hook 'em up.  Make triangles.
Ingress,3dzglt,SweetMister,7,Mon Jul 20 21:15:18 2015 UTC,"Just to add to the concept of fielding.  Full deploying portals (8 resos, 2 mods) is an easy 2k AP a pop, look for heavily unclaimed areas to full deploy along with linking up and fielding. Also do a search on layered fielding to maximize AP gain.  Glyph hacking enemy portals for AP is rather good too."
Ingress,3dzglt,thedan1984,4,Mon Jul 20 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"Sweet. In the park I was in, the whole place was linked already. Going to hopefully find an area that's not so well developed in the future."
Ingress,3dzglt,RedditAntiHero,10,Mon Jul 20 21:29:17 2015 UTC,Before you go out playing.. look on www.ingress.com/intel with spots that seem interesting to you.  When I was level 1-3... I mostly just looked for naturals to take.   At 4-5 I started really getting into looking at unfielded places that we already owned a lot of and started scoring on fields.  6-7.... I just look on the map where the froggy ports are that have like a bunch of links and go kill those to get half the AP they got for creating them.  Less than 10k till 8. I cant wait!
Ingress,3dzglt,foofdawg,4,Mon Jul 20 21:56:03 2015 UTC,Now you've got me pumped up to keep going!
Ingress,3dzglt,Spritzertog,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:29 2015 UTC,"True, but it's really 1563 for making a field (if you didn't create the other two links) because you can't make a field without laying the last link, which is worth another 313 automatically."
Ingress,3dzglt,clavierkid,2,Tue Jul 21 00:06:32 2015 UTC,"Capture a portal = 500 AP ..  Fully deploy = 1500 AP Link = 313 Field = 1563.    so .. 3 portals, fully captured and deployed, 2 links @ 313 and the final link/field == ?  6507 AP.  (plus any points for glyph hacking)  Definitely fastest way to level is to capture, deploy, and link/field.  When you get higher levels, (usually around 6), you can start doing a lot more damage . .then you can get all the AP for destroying the enemy fields, links, portals, and then get your cap/link/fielding on."
Ingress,3dzglt,LimDul79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:41 2015 UTC,"In reality, making a field is actually 1250 AP (for the field) plus 939 AP (for making the 3 links). So making a field by yourself is 2189 AP total! A great way to level up."

What this adds up to, though, is a max velocity of ~500k per weekday (1hr walking commute in the morning, 1hr at lunch, 1hr home, plus some bonus time), plus ~1M per weekend day, for a total of about 4.5M per week. My best weeks are generally less than that (~2.5-3M), because other priorities mean that I don't actually play much on the weekend.  I'm full time employed, married, and a parent. I can carve out that much time to play during the week without impacting my home life or work life.

Lots of opportunity to make fields and set up anchors or swap keys with other agents!  Pretty ideal set up.

For most of my time playing ingress I had a 50% travel job hopping around the country.   At night I'm stuck in a hotel just.. bored.. so I wandered the city.     I tried to play games online with my friends, even specifically finding hotels which provided ethernet hookups instead of wifi.. but there's just too many people on the internet connections in hotel to play multiplayer anything without so much lag that you're screwed.  Ingress won't lag (more than usual) and a rental car with unlimited gas has a nice perk.     That being said the hours on the road are usually long.  They generally expect around 40 hours.. (often) not including flying in and flying home which adds up to a lot.  So - it very much contributed to my 700 portals approved, but it didn't get me anywhere close to the AP that the top players have."

I did get to play in a lot of neat places though.  Fort Worth Stockyards, Gettysburg, Washington DC, Great Wall of LA, La Brea Tarpits, St Louis sculpture gardens, Grand Rapids Frederik Meijers sculpture garden.    Go to a new city, find a big cluster and you're pretty sure to see something awesome.  I built up quite a few cities on the east coast with submissions.

Ingress,3duplx,Dangerjim,2,Sun Jul 19 20:50:15 2015 UTC,Most of the top level players live in major cities with massive clusters of portals. Big clusters of portals means less time traveling between them thus they can manage the high ap/hr required to content at that level.   When I lived in Chicago it took me 30mins to hack 90 portals - while here in rural area it takes me 2 hours to hack glyph hack 90 portals. Much of the time is moving from one portal to the next.   Trade off is guradian and baf's for MU are easier but harvesting high level gear is much harder. Building high level portals in the city is easy way more players to help build while in rural players have to travel upwards of 30mins to help build.
Ingress,3duplx,GDogg007,2,Sun Jul 19 21:35:51 2015 UTC,I'm in no way a top ingress player but the thing that makes me able to build and destroy across my town on a daily basis is the fact I commute by bicycle 11 miles a day minimum.

It's primarily based on AP, but I keep track of medal count as well. While it is flawed because it doesn't count play time, it works as in indicator of progress. There are 3 L15 on each team. I am 3rd for ENL and 5th overall. I work a normal 9-5 and I really only play when I'm walking my dog. The top ENL and overall also has a 9-5 (maybe 8-4) but is single and has more time to devote. I don't know what #2 does but she has school aged kids and is always driving them to activties. I'm pretty sure the #1 RES works in IT, so a standard 9-5. #2 is an EMT so he travels and has odd hours, and #3 works some sort of overnight job so he basically has free roam wherever and whenever he plays."

I think it also helps if you don't have a lot of evening commitments,  so you can play in morning before work,  at lunchtime,  and then after work until late evening.

Ingress,3dwf55,DrLuciferZ,3,Mon Jul 20 04:10:12 2015 UTC,If you think programming is that easy go try make a calculator....   With such huge database of portals around the world I doubt that it'll be easy as just adding few filters
Ingress,3dwf55,Nerixel,3,Mon Jul 20 04:49:21 2015 UTC,"What /u/hideogumpa is saying, in its exact form, is not hard. There are many people who underestimate the difficulty of programming, but in this case they're pretty spot on.   Specifically, you would do this:  DELETE FROM     `Portals` WHERE (`PortalName` LIKE '%fire department%')      AND (`PortalName` NOT LIKE '%plaque%')      AND (`PortalName` NOT LIKE '%mural%')   Of course, adding additional ANDs as required, for each of the terms. For instance, my mind accidentally started using memorial instead of mural, so I'd probably add memorial.  Because in all likelihood, Ingress is using an SQL database to store these, or something that this above command could be easily ported to. This is nowhere near an efficient query (timewise), but as a one time event it wouldn't need to be.  Because I'm really bored, here's the result of me actually testing this query on a database. There is one entry that contains no trigger words, one which contains the trigger words ""fire department"" and no others, and the other two contain both ""fire department"", as well as each having one of the exclusion terms.  mysql> SELECT * FROM Portals; +----+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | ID | PortalName                                                     | +----+----------------------------------------------------------------+ |  1 | This is a control portal, containing none of the trigger words | |  4 | Californian Fire Department Plaque - in the line of duty       | |  5 | Alabama County Fire Department                                 | |  6 | Australian Fire Department Mural                               | +----+----------------------------------------------------------------+ 4 rows in set (0.00 sec)  mysql> DELETE FROM `Portals` WHERE (`PortalName` LIKE '%fire department%') AND ( `PortalName` NOT LIKE '%plaque%') AND (`PortalName` NOT LIKE '%mural%'); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)  mysql> SELECT * FROM Portals; +----+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | ID | PortalName                                                     | +----+----------------------------------------------------------------+ |  1 | This is a control portal, containing none of the trigger words | |  4 | Californian Fire Department Plaque - in the line of duty       | |  6 | Australian Fire Department Mural                               | +----+----------------------------------------------------------------+ 3 rows in set (0.00 sec)   Edit: Afternote. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for outing the idiots who consider complex programming to be simple.  A lot of Ingress is extremely complex, but this specific task is not difficult. It's just not.  Edit2: Realised I left an extra SELECT in there that was adding no value and taking up a lot of space, so removed that."

Although Niantic tries to detect and ban GPS spoofing and any automated actions (bots) out there, we don't know how successful it is, and there's a noticeable amount of false positives (the Observer faction) as well as noticeable amount of spoofs (achors of large fields taken down, guardian portals flipped with newly created L1 accounts, Otov is still able to run his army of bots, item sellers can still be found on ebay etc). Also they don't seem to give a damn about people with multiple accounts on the same device even they can detect it fairly easy, as there's a legit scenario of family members playing together, plus (perhaps even more important) they need pure numbers to show to the sponsors, they care less (if at all) about the quality of those numbers.

Ingress,3dwp8t,abedNadire,2,Mon Jul 20 06:54:31 2015 UTC,Im getting approvals/rejections of portals i submitted last year at around this date.
Ingress,3dwp8t,DfuR,2,Mon Jul 20 08:06:59 2015 UTC,"I think they switched completely to ""small area"" portal validations. So we had 11 portals that where accepted in 1h (age from 8d - 150d), but nothing from our regular queues (>200) was verified since weeks. And still a lot of ""lost"" portals (age >350d)   I think it s neither an advantage nor an disadvantage. Still waiting for an home portal ;)"
Ingress,3dwp8t,inselll,2,Mon Jul 20 12:14:36 2015 UTC,"Have some portals that I have heard back on in as little as 2 weeks, some on the other hand are well over 750 days."
Ingress,3dwp8t,ScudBucket,2,Mon Jul 20 17:07:29 2015 UTC,It appears they're using more than 1 method to approve portals. The default method seems to be first come first served.  Some people have noticed mass portals being reviewed in areas that don't have a lot of portals. Others have mentioned  entire areas or countries where portals all seem to be appearing over a large general area.
Ingress,3dwp8t,Ollie_ooo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"For the last three weeks, I've had decisions come back on almost all my submissions overnight, I'm averaging about twelve hours between submission and result.. Something has definitely changed there, and not just for me, others in my area are finding it too.."
Ingress,3dwp8t,theunknownjames,2,Mon Jul 20 22:36:12 2015 UTC,"I think there are different local reviewers. Some are faster, some are slower (or don't care much). I've submitted a bunch of portals in one city and I didn't get any notice of those. A week later I submitted some in another city, and they got approved/rejected almost immediately. That's why I think every region has a different reviewer."
Ingress,3dwp8t,imranilzar,2,Tue Jul 21 11:05:40 2015 UTC,I have 10 portals still awaiting a response and a few were from last week. So nothing has improved for me. It seems like they're reviewing in some type of order though because others are receiving several responses per day
Ingress,3dwp8t,Enlbased,3,Mon Jul 20 04:07:40 2015 UTC,"Ah... I guess I lucked out then. I think they're queueing all requests grouped by location, so late requests are processed immediately if they happen to be checking on a particular location."

Ingress,3dxc19,imranilzar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:06:39 2015 UTC,"With regards to churches, they explicitly call them out in the candidate portal criteria:     In addition to using the above acceptance criteria, we often add candidates that are a special nod to industries and networks that connect people around the world, just as Ingress connects Agents around the world. These include:     PUBLIC PLACES OF WORSHIP  A nod to the other worldly, which is integral to the story of Ingress.     No such special category explains gazebos. Architecture, I guess? Not really. But in rural areas Ingress would be really lame without portals on churches, gazebos, and veterans memorials."

What was acceptable once may no longer be accepted.  So the fact that there are other similar portals could mean 2 things..  1. That they had some small feature that made them acceptable (historical plaque), or they were accepted back when they were accepting any kind of water fixture."

Ingress,3dqoe3,kinggeorgec,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"It does help defend the portals the fields are built from, via link mitigation."
Ingress,3dqoe3,fiberpunk,0,Sun Jul 19 20:47:30 2015 UTC,Explain more please.
Ingress,3dqoe3,kinggeorgec,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"Portals also are provided mitigation based on the number of links to/from this portal.  This is combined with the values for shields to obtain the overall mitigation value for this portal.  The formula for calculating the mitigation provided per link is Math.round(400/9*Math.atan(links/Math.E)).  This provides the following mitigation values for the first 8 links:   16 mitigation 28 mitigation 37 mitigation 43 mitigation 48 mitigation 51 mitigation 53 mitigation  55 mitigation   With a formula cap of 69.8 mitigation from links, you would never be able to go higher than that without shields.  Even with shields, portals cap at 95% mitigation, which means no matter how many shields are added to a portal, the combination will never exceed 95% of the total damage that is mitigated.  Additional links/shields do provide backup though, for any others that might fall when the portal is under attack.   Shamelessly copy/pasted from Decode Ingress because they explained it better than I could. Basically, you can get as much protection from links as from shields. A common shield provides +30 mitigation, and 2 links is +28 mitigation. A rare shield is +40, and 3-4 links gets you that same amount of protection. 8 or more links is like adding an extra very rare shield, for free."
Ingress,3dqoe3,fiberpunk,0,Sun Jul 19 21:03:26 2015 UTC,"So links help, but an unlinked portal underneath a field gets no help."

Ingress,3drjp9,mattle,3,Sun Jul 19 03:26:14 2015 UTC,I think it's mostly for the lols but I guess it would make your scanner run like crap loading all those keys and you'd keep pressing on them all the time when trying to click on the portal.
Ingress,3drjp9,hafunampa,2,Sun Jul 19 07:42:09 2015 UTC,There was a huge mission in the central part of town and I think all the participants just dumped keys afterwards. I have a screenshot of it I'll try to post later.
Ingress,3drjp9,bagodicks1911,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:06 2015 UTC,"When you're at an anomaly, make it a sport to pick up as many keys as you can carry (after the first measurement your inventory will have taken a hit anyways). If a lot of people do this the game remains playable. Also spam your communities with requests to not drop any keys but recycle them instead. All in all we kept Utrecht clear of keys, only until people went to the afterparty there were hundreds of keys on the floor, but it didn't matter much anymore at that time anyways.  Added bonus; during Mission Day in Utrecht I picked up about 600 keys. I went to an out-of-the-way portal, fully deployed it and started linking randomly. Due to the massive amount of people being around, any fully deployed portal that you manage to link to will get killed quickly anyways. I managed to shoot well over 100 links, and with some RES attacking my portal and some passerby ENL helping me defend it, it was the best fun I had in a while. Can probably do the same at an anomaly and I will try next time!"
Ingress,3drjp9,Wotuu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:46 2015 UTC,Normal thing also during anomalies. Also dropping keys is faster than recycling them.

Ingress,3drjp9,tehbeautifulangie,0,Mon Jul 20 07:37:20 2015 UTC,"If you mention the trick may as well explain it:  Once you pressed recycle and see the animation of the object being recycled, you can quickly press the cancel button and return to your inventory instantly. That way you can recycle -> cancel -> recycle -> cancel repeat and recycle stuff very fast. I recycled about 600 keys (from Utrecht anomaly/mission day) in under 5 minutes using this technique."

Ingress,3dr1ox,MarkByers,4,Sun Jul 19 03:25:27 2015 UTC,The black illuminator is fairly trivial. You just need to have the right contacts and be prepared to do some travelling.
Ingress,3dr1ox,Siiw,3,Sat Jul 18 20:32:29 2015 UTC,Depends on the area. I spent today covering a ~10 square kilometers area of our 50 000 people town. I covered maybe 1/3 of it and was awarded ~150 MU. Illuminator is something I'll never get without serious travelling.  Even cooperating with the ENL in the next town over has never given more than 600 in total.
Ingress,3dr1ox,SonOfWisdom,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:20:14 2015 UTC,Just be sure to take you DAF down after getting your badge.

Ingress,3dr1ox,sellyme,0,Sun Jul 19 08:32:21 2015 UTC,"...none of those are actually that hard, except Connector, and maybe Purifier. RS7 achieved Black Engineer in 6 months, Illuminator is piss-easy, there's nearly two dozen black Liberators floating around, and Morka/Bodydrag were averaging 6k fields a week when pushing for black Mind Controller.  OP just doesn't play much, if at all. I'm slanted to hit black Mind Controller by the end of this year, and Liberator in January of next year."
Ingress,3dr1ox,jeopardydd,3,Sun Jul 19 04:26:35 2015 UTC,"I think that a lot of people would disagree with you that something isn't hard just because a handful of people in the world have done it.   Most of the onyx badges require a ridiculously huge amount of time and effort, and that's why they are ""hard"" to get."
Ingress,3dr1ox,sellyme,3,Sun Jul 19 14:01:49 2015 UTC,"I'm saying it's not ridiculous for a badge that's meant to be achieved only by the world's best to be completely achievable for the world's best, but not people who play for half an hour a week.  I mean, yes, they're hard in a sense, but that's kind of the point. I'm saying that they're not overly hard for what they're meant to represent. If black Mind Controller was 100,000 fields, that would be ridiculous. As it is, it's a pretty decent point to say ""yep, you've reached the pinnacle of that stat"" (although maybe slightly high - it depends on whether you think Builder/Hacker/Liberator are a good point for blacks, or whether you think Purifier/Mind Controller are better).  TL;DR: Yeah, they're hard, but those badges* are completely reasonable for a highest achievement level.  *(except Illuminator, which is way too easy and too arbitrary to be a badge at all, and Connector, which is a bit too difficult. Mind Controller is probably a bit too difficult as well, but it's still pretty achievable for anyone who wants to grind it out)"
Ingress,3dr1ox,jeopardydd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:11:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that your premise ""only the top few people are meant to get them"".  Maybe that's true, maybe it isn't.  NIA is really bad at calibrating their medal requirements, imo.   Also, if they really ARE meant for only the ""world's best"" than that is a reason why they made them difficult to get, rather a reason why they are not difficult (it's almost a contradiction saying that they made them so only a few people can get them but didn't make them difficult to get).   Hitting a 90 mph fastball is a pretty darn difficult thing to do.  That the world's best can do it doesn't mean that it's not difficult.   In Ingress, the ability to put in the time and effort is the most difficult part in getting some of these black badges, and only a few in the entire world have that ability. Most people can't for various reasons, like obligations, lack of endurance and stamina, not living in a portal-dense area, etc."
Ingress,3dr1ox,sellyme,0,Sun Jul 19 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"Hitting a 90mph fastball is ridiculously difficult for a random bloke on the street, but in the context of a professional game, it's not ridiculous at all. When you're explicitly talking about a badge tier that is the hardest achievement available in the game, saying it's ridiculous for people at the back of the pack just elicits a ""no shit"". But it's not ridiculous for the people it's designed for. If black Builder was 1,000,000 deploys, that'd be ridiculous in any realistic context, but 200,000 is completely reasonable for the kind of people who actually try for it.  With regards to inconsistencies with difficulties, I don't think you'll find many people who think all black badges should be as ""hard"" as Recharger is. Generally Hacker/Builder/Liberator are considered the balanced black badges, although Builder might be getting on the easier side these days."
Ingress,3dr1ox,jeopardydd,2,Sun Jul 19 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"ok, then the baseball analogy of 600 HR's or 3200 hits would be better.  Only a few players have been able to accumulate that many, and it takes a combination of things to do so including stamina, health, time playing in the league, etc.    Baseball players would say that 500 HR's or 3000 hits are incredibly difficult things to accomplish, despite the fact that a lot more players could do it if they had the time playing, health, etc to do it.   Same here - some of the black badges are incredibly difficult due to the time and energy needed to get to those counting stats. It's frankly more than the vast majority of players, including the players who try to gain badges, can do, (i.e. ""difficult"")."
Ingress,3dr1ox,sellyme,0,Sun Jul 19 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"Your entire example is predicated on ignoring per capita statistics. Far more people play baseball than Ingress, so something with roughly as many unique occurrences is clearly much easier in Ingress."
Ingress,3dr1ox,jeopardydd,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:43 2015 UTC,"Uhh, then pick 600 HR's or 3200 hits if you want.  You are quibbling because you don't have a real point.   If the bottom line is that we are defining ""difficult""  different ways, then there will be no meeting of the minds on this one.  I'm pretty sure that I'm defining it the way most people are/would, and that's that it takes a huge amount of time and energy, such that only a small percentage of people have done it though many have worked towards it (or would work towards it if it wasn't so difficult).  That seems like a pretty reasonable definition.   But, I know that you play devil's advocate on here, and generally have to get the last word in (and start attacking the other person if a conversation goes to long), so I'll let you have the last word on this and I'll stop commenting."
Ingress,3dr1ox,sellyme,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"...you just went in completely the wrong direction.  Ingress has fewer players than baseball. Therefore equivalently hard stuff in baseball would be very common due to the sheer quantity of people doing it.  Not being American, I don't give the slightest of a shit about baseball and couldn't give you a decent example, but that's basic statistics."

Ingress,3dqmpp,DaSkunk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"I've been researching it this weekend too.   Some watches have features like wifi connectivity and larger batteries or screen sizes as well as location data on their own or just faster processors.   I saw someone mention elsewhere that those ones can technically work off a hotspot by themselves w/o your phone  (though... why someone would have a hotspot for their watch but not have their phone with is a strange one).    I was very (very..) briefly gawking at the Urbane LTE which actually has it's own LTE antennae to make calls and everything but then I realized it's $600+ so..  ya know what.. I have a phone I don't make calls with anyway :)   Plus it runs it's own new OS, which is not technically android wear therefore ingress won't work on it, and they probably will not program support for a single very expensive watch that not many people have.     I might go for the LG Urbane (non LTE).  I should go into a store to try one on or something.  It's expensive compared to the rest but I do want something that would look nice at work in an office setting. .... so I can hack my work portal during meetings."
Ingress,3dqmpp,Hreidmar1423,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:01:17 2015 UTC,If you are concerned about the bnattery then don't go for Moto 360 but LG G watch or LG G Watch R as those 2 have the best battery so far. But otherwise every watch is the same in software wise.

Ingress,3dogn4,Paulrik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"One HS and one MH is great if it's a portal you can camp out at. I like to take my 3 year old to any playground that has a portal and do this, ideally, the portal will burn out the same time he does.   You get diminishing returns when you double up on a lot of mods. For example, 1 common heat sink takes 1 minute off the cool down timer. If you add a second common heat sink, it only subtracts another 30s. Not sure about multi hacks."

Ingress,3dogn4,PuckStar,2,Mon Jul 20 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"When you need to recycle a lot of keys you can do it quicker by clicking cancel right after you clicked OK (to recycle a key). The animation will stop but the key will be recycled. To zoom in with 1 finger double tap on your scanner but with the second tap, hold your finger on the screen. Now when you slide up or down you will zoom in or out. Use IITC (desktop and mobile) with some additional plugins to easily plan your next move(s). For instance with the Portal list you can sort on the AP that portals will give when you take them down. If you think you can take 1 or more portals down that give the most AP you're time is more worth it. Specially useful when you don't have much time but want maximum AP. When firing you can also hold the fire button for a few milliseconds to shoot larger bursts. Try to let go when the firing ring that goes in and outwards is the closest to the portal. I usually wait for the second time it will be close to the portal. That way you can get a 20% larger burst! When you start Ingress, as soon as you see the world spinning you can click the back button to open the scanner instantly."

Ingress,3dogn4,Brokkenpiloot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:48:57 2015 UTC,For planning the ingress standard is so much easier and better than iitc mate. Knowing which portals tl blow up and being able to have lines drawn from portal to portal easily outweighs all the iitc troublw.. i have tried iitc once and forgotten about it after.
Ingress,3dogn4,PuckStar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you are happy with the ingress standard and don't need anything else :).  Only trying it once and maybe not looking at all the plugins that are handy may prevent you from knowing what else is possible.  I use the drawing tool plugin for IITC where I can do exactly what you can do with ingress standard, but even more. Like saving the url of the lines you created or also placing marks on the map.  So it's not either a portal list or drawing lines.  Bookmarking (maps and portals), player history (helps me quickly find out where a fellow player is without having to chat), seeing portals on a lower zoom level that standard ingress does, portal list (what I mentioned), key management, being to select another map (I use a map with much more detail), Sync (so you have your bookmarks, keys etc. also available when you open IITC on another pc or mobile) etc.  Not sure why you call it IITC ""trouble"". It's so easy.  But maybe it's like iOS and android. If you don't want to have potential handy extra's just with a few extra clicks, you are happy with iOS. If you want freedom and potential handy extra's you want Android.  BTW ook Nederlands? :)"
Ingress,3dogn4,Hereticdark,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:15:53 2015 UTC,Jep.  Draw tools in my opinion feel both inaccurate as well as inferior in showing which links need to be destroyed.

Ingress,3dogn4,dismantle_repair,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:35 2015 UTC,IITC is like a layer over the standard Ingress.com/intel website. You can do/see quite more things with IITC and the plugins for that.  See http://iitc.jonatkins.com/?page=desktop  Here you can find some info on plugins I use http://Puckstar.com/Ingres  But just scroll through the plugin list on the IITC website and decide what you find useful.

Ingress,3dnohz,numinit,3,Mon Jul 20 17:27:42 2015 UTC,Oh I'm not saying the story is irrelevant. In fact I think it is a large reason why many people play.   For me though I don't really care either way. I just like to get out out the house and hang out with folks. I always say the big reason I play is the community.

Ingress,3dnohz,ChewyIsThatU,22,Fri Jul 17 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Enlightened always loses, even when they win.  Simple."
Ingress,3dnohz,bbcversus,4,Fri Jul 17 23:02:34 2015 UTC,yup
Ingress,3dnohz,Eslader,3,Fri Jul 17 23:20:23 2015 UTC,"This is because story-wise, if enlightened wins the game is over."
Ingress,3dnohz,GorillaNosh,3,Sat Jul 18 12:26:31 2015 UTC,The same thing would happen to ENL that is happening to the resistance... IE resistance is bringing forth an unknown artificial intelligence (N'zeer).  Resistance goals have led to mind control (ADA/klue). Whereas the ENL have yet to actually control anyone's mind.  This in my opinion... Is their intent. Whoever wins irl is who becomes evil in the story.  This is what has happened with every anomaly
Ingress,3dnohz,Eslader,2,Sat Jul 18 16:59:51 2015 UTC,I suspect you're right. Story-wise both sides are reacting without all the data. ENL is being dumb and just assuming this alien intelligence is benign. RES is being dumb and trying to kill the project before it can know if it's a good thing or not.
Ingress,3dnohz,Paulrik,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:27:30 2015 UTC,I suspect they plan different ways the story could branch out depending on how each anomaly ends.

Ingress,3dnohz,scatterbrain-d,3,Fri Jul 17 23:13:16 2015 UTC,"They've specified that they see an endpoint for the current storyline, but not the game itself. Presumably a new storyline would start, or they'd just go without one since 80+% of players don't follow it."

I think their original thinking was that the game would last about 2 years?   They mentioned several years ago that they were working on an API. iOS was teased for well over a year. L9-16 was hinted at for months, if not a year. Those are just a few things they've missed the boat on. Take whatever they say with a grain of salt and only believe it when you see it. Such is life."

Ingress,3dlnuf,Konntroll,17,Fri Jul 17 07:26:50 2015 UTC,"Asymmetrical -- powers are not explicitly balanced; rather they are designed to suit different play styles, team player functions, and location peculiarities;  This would result in the most powerful ones being used, and the rest ignored.  In which case you throw away the ones no-one will use anyway, and balance the rest properly."
Ingress,3dlnuf,perringaiden,4,Fri Jul 17 13:20:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah but if you make players choose between the two ""best"" ones, they'll only get one. There's bound to be favorites and cookie cutter builds, but I think there are enough different play styles that the people who make different choices would find a niche.  I would want some means of back tracking, like you can respec once every 6 months or spend some AP to remake your choices. It's not a simple matter to just re-roll a character in Ingress,  and you don't want people making Alts just so they play different character classes."
Ingress,3dlnuf,Paulrik,5,Fri Jul 17 14:25:40 2015 UTC,"These actually aren't bad -- arranging them in skill trees helps mitigate the desire to go for the best ones.   I think there's still a very clear set of superior powers:  Keysmith -> Pack Rat -> Hoarder Plexus Telekinesis Sculptor -> Architect Puppeteer  This is oriented around BFGs. Telekinesis is the most important competent of this. Being able to hack keys on the other side of long links is tremendously useful -- it makes rethrows far easier, makes it easier to get rare keys, etc.  Puppeteer is a great BFG power. If I have a chance to rip apart enemy farms by throwing a field over them, I'm gonna be really happy.  Architect and Hoarder combine to give me the ability to generate L7 portals on my own for gear farming. That's really good. I'm also getting 1100 miles of range when linking from portals I build myself, assuming ULAs and not VRLAs. This is almost double what I'd get without Architect and Sculptor, so it's a significant boost.  It's an interesting line of thought, though -- I like this better than most ideas I've seen for additional powers."
Ingress,3dlnuf,Thanlis,2,Fri Jul 17 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"I think there's still a very clear set of superior powers: Keysmith -> Pack Rat -> Hoarder Plexus Telekinesis Sculptor -> Architect Puppeteer   I think it's a testament to the quality of OP's ideas that I disagree with you on some the 'very clear set of superior powers'.  Personally, if the ideas were implemented as chosen I would go:   Interpreter/Codebreaker Vanquisher/Conquerer Sculptor/Architect Plexus Puppeteer"
Ingress,3dlnuf,SovietJugernaut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a pretty solid first take on the proposal! I definitely chose based on the assumption that a) you'd be trying to score global MU points and b) you'd be max level. I think there are better choices for (say) leveling up.   And actually even there you want a few agents with Keeper/Sentinel for certain activities. So, yeah, interesting."
Ingress,3dlnuf,Thanlis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:55:37 2015 UTC,"I like the ones related to scoring more keys too, I do a lot of linking and fielding. But I 've seen a lot of players that just love to smash stuff too. They roll through town, smash all the fields,maybe throw down 1 resonator to get credit for a capture, but they never throw any of their own links. They would have no interest in plugging up their inventory with keys.   The ability to specialize to suit different play styles might be a good way encourage players to experiment with different styles of game play.  There was a survey on this reddit this week, I was surprised to see how many people chose smashing stuff as their favorite aspect of the game."
Ingress,3dlnuf,Paulrik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"There was a survey on this reddit this week, I was surprised to see how many people chose smashing stuff as their favorite aspect of the game.   Is it really that surprising? Building is more AP overall but it takes longer in the moment and is slower-going. Hours of your work can be destroyed in minutes.  Destroying is definitely less fun if you are in an active area with people rebuilding on top of you, but that is pretty rare."
Ingress,3dlnuf,SovietJugernaut,9,Fri Jul 17 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"My default response remains the same - high level players already have all the advantages they need, and overcomplicating the game can be a barrier to adoption.  Also, some of these are problematic - e.g. Puppeteer combined with a BAF means people losing guardians all over.. Though as a mechanic to neutralise an unreachable enemy portal it's certainly interesting..  But credit where it's due, lists like this pop up every week and yours is the best I've seen yet."
Ingress,3dlnuf,theunknownjames,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:23:42 2015 UTC,"This at least gives an incentive for lower levels to keep playing the game so they can have these benefits. In most games higher level players have more advantages, not sure why this should be an exception."
Ingress,3dlnuf,bbliss17,4,Fri Jul 17 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"By the time you've reached L8, you don't need any further incentive to continue, the addiction already has you...  ... but seriously, I don't see any evidence that there's an attrition problem when players hit L8, if anything the struggle is getting people engaged in the first place, which means not over powering their opponents and giving them a simple ruleset."
Ingress,3dlnuf,theunknownjames,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"Puppeteer combined with a BAF means people losing guardians all over..    This could be pretty easily remedied by adding in a 'cooldown' or having the chance be fairly small (or a combination of both). Plus it would be extra motivation for people to not only put their BAF anchors in hard-to-reach places, but for those running to kill them, too..."
Ingress,3dlnuf,SovietJugernaut,8,Fri Jul 17 17:49:49 2015 UTC,I'd be happy if they added a feature to sort/filter our portal keys to show only portals you currently own.
Ingress,3dlnuf,ZedAvatar,5,Fri Jul 17 14:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'm actually quite impressed. The names are great, the idea for a tech tree with 1 per level is a big limiting factor, and there is enough balance (even though you don't explicitly balance it) to begin with that I'd think there would be a good diversity.  Some of these need a little work, but overall one of the best tech tree proposals I've seen yet."
Ingress,3dlnuf,SovietJugernaut,7,Fri Jul 17 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"You obviously put a lot of thought into this. I applaud that and even gave an upvote. However, what I like about Ingress is that it's the simplest game in the world and yet is so complicated....as is.   What you propose would make it complicated I fear. I like simple and don't see a need to boost higher level agents any more than they are already. Super post though..."
Ingress,3dlnuf,Bamilbis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Was telling my room mate (who doesn't play) last night, as a matter of fact, that you can explain the game in one sentence, teach someone to play in an afternoon, but it takes months, even a year, to get GOOD, and play is always changing based on the current interactions between the 2 factions in an area."
Ingress,3dlnuf,finmeister,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:08:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Bamibis. I do agree that there is a degree of disparity in terms of power level between the higher level agents and the newbies.   However, it was not my intention to make the powerful more powerful yet. Just to make things a little bit more diverse and interesting as well as to add some motivation for people to progress beyond level 8, to have something to look forward to in the game as well as to mitigate the boredom that sets in sometimes among the higher level agents, particularly those who are not into the lore of the game.  Finally, as progression through the first 8 levels would in this case remain unchanged, I believe that the game would remain simple enough not to discourage newcomers by sheer complexity of its mechanics."
Ingress,3dlnuf,MalachiDraven,3,Tue Jul 21 06:01:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, you put a lot of thought into this. Good job! I like most of it, although I do feel that none of it is necessary. As someone else already said, high level players have all the power they need, and it just wouldn't be good to make the game too complicated. If Ingress was meant to be a full-on complex RPG, though (which I'd love) then these ideas would be so perfect."

Ingress,3dlnuf,w34ver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"The names are great and the ideas and concepts described are fantastic.  My reservation would be that I, as a relatively new player, struggle against my multiple L10 - L15 local enemy agents as it is. They don't need more advantage over the L4 newbies like myself.  If they had even one or two of the powers listed and put them to good use locally, I would stand absolutely no chance and would likely leave the game.  As it is now, I'm not powerful enough to take down many of their portals, so I tend to wait for my teammates to clear the lot before I go in and generate some fielding AP in their wake, or use Intel to find neutral portals, but they have become few and far between lately."
Ingress,3dlnuf,CHESTHAIR_OVERDRIVE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, w34ver, and I do sympathize. But I also believe that Ingress is a game best played socially or, better yet, in a team, which is what I sought to encourage by adding (some of) these mechanics. Since you already work with your teammates, directly or indirectly, I think adding these advanced powers would not cause you too much trouble.  Then again, there is something to be said for playing the game alone and I do play Ingress that way for the most part. With this in mind, just wait till you get to level 6 or so. It shouldn't be long now before their fancy portals start going down left and right, fast. Good luck."

Ingress,3dkach,HeroCC,7,Thu Jul 16 23:20:09 2015 UTC,Great for him! Tell them to put any and all high level stuff in there and they could well be stacked by the time level 8 happens.
Ingress,3dkach,LordMugwort,2,Thu Jul 16 23:44:55 2015 UTC,I will be sure to tell him. He is now a level two and is holding a bunch of L3 / rare stuff in there!
Ingress,3dkach,zatic,2,Fri Jul 17 02:22:21 2015 UTC,Yes! If they play about an hour each day they could have up to 20!!!!! extra items by the time they hit level 8. Imagine the riches!  MUFG capsules really are way less exciting in practice than what they sound like in theory.
Ingress,3dkach,SovietJugernaut,2,Fri Jul 17 09:40:50 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you generally, it also depends on the items involved--having 20+ XMP is not that exciting. Having 20+ AXA/ADA/Jarvis/VRMH/VRHS certainly is."

Ingress,3dkach,LordMugwort,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:37 2015 UTC,Depends how long it takes for them to get there. I had a tonne of lvl 8 stuff by the time I could use it. If it had been in an MUFG the whole time I would have had double. (My MUFGS have been reproducing quite often)

Ingress,3dkach,SovietJugernaut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"For context, 400+ hacks is not a lot given that many of these rarer items only drop (on average) in 1:1500 or 1:2500 hacks.  For many larger cities, doing ~1,000 hacks/week is about the minimum for many agents to consider that player ""active"" during the week."

But they're very new, introduced just a few weeks ago, so there aren't many floating around yet.  Unlike the other four items listed above, they don't get used up. So someday, we'll hear the same refrain with these that we get with regular capsules. ""Anyone need a MUFG? I've got way too many."" That day is still far, far away, though."

Today it was yet another MFUG with an ADA. I predominantly hack two to six L5-7 RES portals, since the closest L6 ENL hub takes me about 30 mins to get to on a bike (I know that I'm lazy). I also don't farm since I find it boring.  My thinking is that people who haven't played for a while get good loot for a while to encourage playing. When I registered my account about a year ago, I wasn't involved at all.

Ingress,3diy35,PuckStar,6,Thu Jul 16 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"Took me a while to learn that. Seems there's more skill getting closer to the portal, rather than further from it. So it seems odd to reward the other.  Did I phrase that right?"
Ingress,3diy35,InsaneImmortal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:13:26 2015 UTC,"Well the ""skill"" is also that once you attacked an enemy portal standing in the middle, you need to remember to go to the edge once it's neutral, before deploying.    often people forget this and just start deploying right after it's neutral, and thus reso's are in the midle."
Ingress,3diy35,PM_ME_YOUR_UVULA_PLS,5,Fri Jul 17 12:17:14 2015 UTC,How do you deploy at a distance? All my resonators stay like at half the distance i want them to be.
Ingress,3diy35,uniSean,6,Thu Jul 16 20:19:08 2015 UTC,"Deploy distance is based on your own distance from the portal; for example, if you're 20m away from the portal when you're dropping resonators, your resonators will appear 20m away from the portal itself.  You ideally want to have the portal as close to the edge of your action range (the orange circle in-game) as possible, since burster damage scales with distance and having resonators spread out helps reduce damage by a small amount.  Whoever deployed the resonators in the picture was literally standing right on top of the portal while deploying, which generally isn't recommended unless you plan on adding link amps and flipping it back to mess with someone."
Ingress,3diy35,InsaneImmortal,6,Thu Jul 16 20:30:02 2015 UTC,This was not in the tutorial!
Ingress,3diy35,RatherNerdy,3,Fri Jul 17 05:56:41 2015 UTC,"This is something that needs to be in the tutorial.

Ingress,3diy35,InsaneImmortal,2,Fri Jul 17 14:47:00 2015 UTC,So best if i can walk in a circular path 20m away while deploying resonators or can i stay in one spot 20m away. and deploy from there?

Ingress,3doe3l,richie9x,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"No one outside of Niantic knows the drop rate to any degree of certainty. Beware of people that claim to know.  The drop rate for ADAs and Jarvis seem to be between 1/500 and 1/1000. The probability of each seems to be independent of the other.  We can model this probability with a binomial distribution.  If we assume the odds are 1/1000 then the probability of getting exactly 2 ADAs after 303 hacks is 3.4%. The probability of getting exactly 1 Jarvis after 303 hacks is 22.4%.   If we assume the odds are 1/500 then the probability of getting exactly 2 ADAs after 303 hacks is 10%. The probability of getting exactly 1 Jarvis after 303 hacks is 33.1%.  So better than average, but not too out of the ordinary."

You had several days to complete them before the check in event.   At the event, after they verified completion they checked your name off the list and pushed badges the next day.   Note, don't forget to pre-register.   2 special missions went live during the event which required you to know a lot of storyline trivia as every portal had a passphrase.   These missions took about 15 min each to complete and if you did you received a special swag card which was autographed by the two characters that were there.  Was a very fun get together.

Ingress,3dm1g4,ceymoreasses,6,Fri Jul 17 11:54:38 2015 UTC,It's called scraping.  Anyone can set up a script to take every portal captured from the intel page and write it to a database.  Is is then very simple to write a query to find EVERY portal of a certain player that has been captured by date.  Both sides do it.  This has ruined the guardian badge game mechanic.  It is now impossible to hide your guardian.

Ingress,3dm1g4,dreamedofworld,3,Fri Jul 17 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"If you already captured a guardian but you are not sure which one it is then it is too late to scrape for it.  You would have had to been scraping the intel page portal capturing info on the day you captured it to be able to tell.    The banning question is grey area.  In theory, some one could technically sit all day and watch the intel page and copy and paste the portal capture text into a spread sheet and record the same info that you need for a scraped database.  Writing a script (short bit of code that reads the text from the webpage com) that does this for you makes it so the computer is copying the text out of the com and writing it a DB for you.  THere are a few ways to determine which portal is yoru guardian.  Google them.  Easiest is to ask your local Ingress rep if they have access to a scrape database and get them to query the data from the day your guardian count started."

The van was moved a mile away the next day and the neighbors say the block was shut down for Portlandia.  There were other strange vehicles around, like a vintage airstream RV and lots of vans, but those were likely part of the Portlandia thing.  I thought I stumbled on something cool, but it seems not.

Out of respect for everyone's privacy, especially the van driver, I don't want to say too much more about the location, but it will likely be parked in the area until there is another Niantic event where they bring the van."

It is right next to the shoot today and the area is flooded with production vehicles (Old School Craft, RVs, Trucks, tents full of lighting rigs, UHaul fileld with wardrobe racks)  Everyone I could get too was too busy to talk to, but they looked to be filming inside a house.    The van is parked right next to it all, and has no registration stickers and what looks to be a fake plate for filming as opposed to a real license plate.

They basically processed the entire backlog. Response times are now as low as 2-3 minutes during local business hours, so it seems we have a local team of monkeys now, it's pretty awesome.

As evident here on various posts, they sometimes focus on specific areas, specific types (which are probably easier to validate than others), and also give like a lower priority  to some portals, which makes sense if if you consider...   If you have a park with 1000 submissions from various people but realistically you can only have 100  working portals evenly spaced then if they go for just those and toss the rest on the backburner then they maximized the efficiency of getting LIVE portals out there..

Ingress,3ddq53,jd13jd13,6,Wed Jul 15 19:46:51 2015 UTC,"Someone local to me routinely has over 20 fields to his couch, yet ENL leaves it alone. Why? Because they know he has tons of keys for the portal and can put them back up fairly easily. Killing the portal will give the attacker AP,  but he can get much more putting them back up. He doesn't recharge the portal on purpose in hopes that it gets killed,  but local ENL wised up and deny him the fielding."
Ingress,3ddq53,theguywhokillsgordon,6,Wed Jul 15 18:44:24 2015 UTC,"If I were them, I'd get the AP for blowing it up. Why does it matter if he gets AP, too? Seems like a good deal for both sides."
Ingress,3ddq53,Kalkaline,3,Thu Jul 16 03:48:50 2015 UTC,Some people play a spiteful game.  I make sure to key collect for portals the ENL want to campfire.  Shooting 20+ links in to a portal and having their teammates destroy it is far more satisfying than Jarvising and retaking.

Ingress,3ddq53,auxark,4,Wed Jul 15 20:26:39 2015 UTC,"mitigation still caps at 95. anything over 95 is sorta overkill/backup, so that if 1 shield gets knocked off, it will still be at 95. Also AXAs only have 70 shielding, not 90."

Ingress,3dhh98,doncharliev,11,Thu Jul 16 08:46:20 2015 UTC,"I don't like such deals. And by your report I think I'm right. You can't make deals between ENL and RES because there are to many players. Players who don't like the deal, players who don't know the deal, visitors who can't know the deal. Ingress is a game of ""war"" between the two factions. And such deals go against the ""spirit"" of the game. I can understand the reason for the deals, but I can also understand if people don't accept the deal. If you have a standing farm of both colors there is no reason to organize yourself to build on your own.  And if people break the deal (because the don't like it or don't know the deal) it will create tension and one side will accuse the other side that they are bad and don't stick to deals.   So for the relation between the factions no deals are way better because deals will be broken.  The only thing I find ok are deals between a small number of people like leaving a shared work portal blue or green because at work you don't won't to battle constantly for a portal - you have to work."
Ingress,3dhh98,LimDul79,4,Thu Jul 16 09:15:01 2015 UTC,"I thinks it's okay to try to make deals like this, but you can't expect them to last for the reasons above.   We had an L8 farm that we didn't attack, until somebody came visiting. He smashed it up, we all said ""dude, WTF?"" and he says ""where I came from, we make our own L8 farms."" He had no idea we just didn't have enough active local L8+ agents to do that.   Ingress is a very different game from place to place. In some areas, L8 portals get left up, because everyone wants to benefit from the resources they provide. In other places, they get smashed quickly, because nobody wants the other team to benefit from the resources they provide."
Ingress,3dhh98,Paulrik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:38:15 2015 UTC,He had no idea we just didn't have enough active local L8+ agents to do that.   Two ways to remedy that: flipcards or recruiting! Although both are harder to do in smaller/rural areas...

Ingress,3dhh98,Bownage,3,Thu Jul 16 09:14:32 2015 UTC,"You really don't need L8 portals,   Agreed, but it's always preferable to have them. The extra successful glyph will make a big difference in terms of items hacked, not to mention their extra quality. Sure, the time bonus might be lower but that extra glyph more than compensates it. As for item quality, i seem to be getting more very rares (and in general more mods) when hacking L8 compared to L7, not to mention the almighty PC8 and the darn R8s that never seem to drop off L7 portals."
Ingress,3dhh98,Aartuditu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:38:29 2015 UTC,I have seen a similar correlation between VR items and portal level.   P7's give out a variety of gear from lv6 to lv8 reso's and bursters with 1 or 2 mods common or rare.   While P8's generally more lv8 gear and rare mods with a higher probability of VR mods  I glphy hack ~90 portals daily with about 98% success rate and most nights these are p7 with about 1-3 VR items per night.  When they get P8 and stay for about 2 days - I see between 6-8 VR items per night. Also noticed P8's give out more ada/jarvis's too.   Similarly my co-hacker who does the same walk with me at the same time has the same sort of results.   We have 6 local players and then just wait till we get folks from out of town to upgrade us. Sometimes will go months before P8 and sometimes if we are lucky within a week.   Both factions are quick to smash P8 farms though so they do not last long.
Ingress,3dhh98,hpizzy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:11:43 2015 UTC,"As for item quality, i seem to be getting more very rares (and in general more mods) when hacking L8 compared to L7   This is either confirmation bias or a lucky string by the RNG gods. Every portal has an equal chance of paying out for mods--the only thing that portal levels affect (if you're tap-hacking) is the levels of PC, XMP, US, and resos.  The biggest confirmation bias for those kinds of theories is because you're way more likely to pay close attention to the payouts of P8s than P7s."
Ingress,3dhh98,SovietJugernaut,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:06:36 2015 UTC,I imagine some of what the poster is seeing is because of glyphing. Glyphing on an 8 provides a larger bonus than glyphing a 7. So more VR is likely to occur.
Ingress,3dhh98,nivekps2,2,Fri Jul 17 01:34:05 2015 UTC,"With my 3 fellow 8+ players in the area, making our own farms are quite simple really, and like you say a l7 farm is enough most days. We've created 3 in the past quite easily on our own..."
Ingress,3dhh98,Ketaskooter,3,Thu Jul 16 09:27:55 2015 UTC,Deals like this are used in towns where there are only a handful of people that play the game.  Towns where the only way a portal makes it to L8 is with help from visitors or use of viruses.  When these deals are made its among the people who live and play there and you can't expect every visitor to notice/honor the local farm
Ingress,3dhh98,Aartuditu,2,Thu Jul 16 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"Tbh, to think that such a deal will stand more than a few hours is rather unrealistic. Sure, a flash cross-faction farm (usually beergressing) might work and in most cases does, as long as the place is isolated enough as to prevent unknowing agents tearing it down.  Regardless of faction, behind every ""Agent"" is a living, breathing, emotional human being. Some get along just fine when they meet and use the game as a pretext to chat, make jokes and have a cold one. Even if they're opposite factions and will use the farmed items to blow up eachothers' portals. Other just don't, even if they're in the same faction because they're very different as individuals and will not get together to build a farm.  TLDR: anything goes in this game as long as you respect its rules and in general act like a decent human being; just don't expect it to last forever (be realistic)."
Ingress,3dhh98,cofko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:53:16 2015 UTC,"While back when in my city we didn't have enough active players, we had some agreement about ""protected"" portals - the other faction was forbidden to engage it, so it could become L8 portal in some reasonable time. As it was in early days of Ingress, it earned some people onyx guardians (over 150 days).  Since we had about 10 players per faction it was easy to maintain but later we didn't need such deals because some players were not aware of those special portals."

Agreements like that might work in small areas with few players, but once you get more and more players involved, it just doesn't work. No one can boss around other players to enforce such a thing, so unless it's unanimously agreed to on both sides, it's not going to work and will just result in resentment.   I hope your RES agent doesn't pull out of FS. It sounds like your area needs a good FS to keep cross-faction relations good."

Ingress,3dd1md,auxark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is weird. BAF MUs are calculated by the area of the last anchor. So if you make your last link from a national park, it'll be worse than if you threw it from a small town."

For one the statues, which should be portals, don't have portals on them, but the water with nothing in it has three random portals.   The problem being that portals are an overlay on an 2d object (picture of POI), but in reality they'd occupy the same place. Thus with something physical, like Lego, you can't both have an object and portal take up the same space without it looking weird."
Ingress,3d9r3k,kuvter,3,Wed Jul 15 07:17:23 2015 UTC,Not necessarily true ... LEGO is already examining the idea of 3d printing to customize it's base legos - they snap on over the base LEGO and can be helmets or props etc.  Generic statue or anything taken a photo of could be translated into 3-d printer map with an algorithm (hosted as service on lego.com) then printed at the person's home with their own 3-D printer.

I just think it'll be a while before we get a personal 3d printer that can make Lego.   I'm definitely glad to know that places, like Kinkos, already have ways to do that now. Thanks for sharing."

Ingress,3da025,Here_comes_the_D,2,Tue Jul 14 19:09:20 2015 UTC,Figure anything out yet?
Ingress,3da025,Here_comes_the_D,2,Wed Jul 15 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"Yes and No. We tried all sorts of things and it didn't really seem to make a difference. Who knows, it could just be a huge coincidence. I have been noticing a few things.  The way I play, I like to drive to a local park, get out, and walk around for a while hacking everything in sight. She prefers to do more cargressing. She really enjoys the missions, and likes to drive to a place, hack one or two things, go somewhere else, etc.  Because of this, I noticed that my GPS really starts to act up when I'm moving in the car. I'm not talking about trying to perform functions going over 50 km/h. We are always doing less than that speed, and I'm well aware of the speed cap, or whatever you call it. Regardless, I don't do anything while we're driving anyway.   Anyway, when we get to a new location I noticed it takes quite a bit for the GPS to get its bearings again in Ingress. Now, I've never had problems using navigation in Google Maps or anything while driving. This seems to be only an Ingress issue.  So, after doing some more research about GPS problem, I've noticed a large group of people have had problems due to their phone case. I do have an Otterbox Defender on my phone so that definitely might be an issue. Laugh at me if you will, but I am way too paranoid to walk around without a case on the phone.  That being said, my next test is to go out and get a cheaper jelly-like case like she has and see if that makes a difference. Again, I hadn't noticed the possibility of the case being the culprit before, because I've never had GPS issues up until the point we started playing together. Weird.  I will update as soon as I find out whether the case made a difference. Sorry for the long text and typos, but I'm doing it with voice typing so I kind of just started rambling."
Ingress,3da025,Here_comes_the_D,2,Wed Jul 15 21:30:42 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, physical obstructions such as car roofs and thick phone cases can have an impact on the ability for your phone's radio to receive the GPS signal. And other signals. So can heavy vegetation. I don't notice it much in my day to day stuff. I do often notice this effect when I'm out in really rural areas where cell reception is weak.     GPS Status and Toolbox will give you a visual representation of the relative strength of the signal from the various satellites. You can check it out under varying conditions.     Also note that mapping apps will typically ""snap"" you to the roadway or walking path, automatically filtering out the noise to put you in its best guess of where you are. Ingress's location is more ""raw,"" drifting around in response to noisy or conflicting location data. This can be frustrating, but in the end allows for much greater freedom of movement. (Imagine if your player icon always snapped to roadways! That wouldn't work well.)     Good luck!"

Ingress,3da025,Siiw,3,Thu Jul 16 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"As long as your phones are not one on top of each other, in that case the phone below might get some interference, I'm guessing you're at least 1 meter apart when you play together. From a EM wave point of view, there is no interference or weakening of the signal when in proximity with another phone. I don't have an alternative reason to give you, but I can guarantee the problem doesn't reside there"

Ingress,3d5csb,wjjeeper,2,Mon Jul 13 19:53:08 2015 UTC,My memory agrees. You could put a rare shield over a common for example.

From what I understand, you could deploy mods, gain ap, remove them, and repeat until you ran out.    With the passcodes, you had an near-infinite source of mods."
Ingress,3d5csb,TehWildMan_,2,Mon Jul 13 21:39:59 2015 UTC,Upgrading your own resos definitely counts towards badge credit.

If you hack a portal to burnout and then place a heat sink on it, it resets the hack count. So, being about to put a heatsink on, take it off, and put another on would allow you theoretically unlimited hacks on a single portal."

But it wasn't until about 6 months later in August 2013 that they removed the ability to remove mods.  Also what people seem to forget was there was a very similar incident with popchip barcodes in December 2012. But people always seem to remember Zipcar incident.

Ingress,3d5csb,kuvter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"Wait, don't heat sinks shorten the length of time you have to wait between hacks? Multihacks are what allow you to hack it after it burns out."
Ingress,3d5csb,doctormink,3,Mon Jul 13 21:36:37 2015 UTC,"Let say you have a portal. With no mods you can hack it 4 times. Now take this portal and put a common multihack on it. You can now hack it 8 times. You've only put 1 mod on it at this point so you can add one more. Now, hack the portal 8 times and it will be burned out but if you put a heat sink on it, in addition to the heat sink's normal behavior, it will reset both the cooldown timer, as well as reset the burnout counter.  So using this method of applying 1 common multihack first, hacking to burn out, then adding a heat sink, you can hack a portal 16 times. If you use rare or very rare multihacks in place of the common you can get 24 and 32 hack out of the portal, respectively.   Edit: Oh, I forgot. This reset effect only works for the person deploying the heat sink. No one else's hack counter will be reset.  Source"
Ingress,3d5csb,SabaBoBaba,7,Mon Jul 13 21:49:40 2015 UTC,"It got removed after the zipcar fiasco.   Zipcar plates were codes good for mods. Someone figured out that zipcar registered their cars in batches, so people were easily able to guess strings of hundreds of consecutive plate numbers. The codes were passed around. Basically, you could sit at one portal, redeem codes, place and remove shields as long as you were willing. After a couple of days, they stopped giving AP for mods, and limited everyone to 1 mod per portal."
Ingress,3d5csb,TheRipler,2,Mon Jul 13 19:19:52 2015 UTC,"That's a reason not to allow removal, but in-place upgrading a mod to a rarer one of the same type isn't exploitable in the same way, because there's a (small) limit to the number of times you can upgrade."

Ingress,3d5csb,MaxMouseOCX,11,Tue Jul 14 01:49:51 2015 UTC,"You think you would love this, but it is another example of something sensible that changes game balance. With this mod, EVERY portal either side cared about would quickly end up with 4 VR shields on it.  That would make the game more static, and it would discourage <L8 players, who would have essentially no chance of killing a portal and claiming it as their own, even at L7.  Also, as it is now, you have to think carefully about the importance of a portal from the moment you capture it, if you're going to mod it. Those 2 common shields you threw on without thinking can become a real problem."
Ingress,3d5csb,NormanKnight,2,Mon Jul 13 21:12:12 2015 UTC,Exactly.
Ingress,3d5csb,GorillaNosh,6,Tue Jul 14 15:09:04 2015 UTC,This has been a suggestion since different shield types were introduced in beta. It's pretty much a safe bet it won't be happening. Unless there's some future massive game overhaul.

Ingress,3d5csb,bobpaul,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, changing that to make mods permanent was an intentional decision.   There was hopes that the 9 - 16 level introduction would also include some abilities like what you're describing, (e.g. level 14+ can upgrade mods etc). However, since that option has been bypassed intentionally for whatever reason for nearly two years, I gather they intend to keep it that way."
Ingress,3d5csb,giveer,3,Mon Jul 13 19:36:46 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering why this isn't an option ever since starting; it would make complete sense, and there's already a precedent with the ability to upgrade resos. Assumably they have a specific reason."

(Come to think of it, I think we only had shields back then).  When Link Amps first came out we could remove them after making our links and put shields on. That was cool, too."

Ingress,3d5csb,Invictus227,3,Mon Jul 13 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of upgrading items... in your inventory!  Like taking maybe five mods to upgrade to the next one, so five common shields combine to make a rare shield. Five rare shields make a very rare. That would be awesome. Numbers could be tweaked for balance.   Or taking three level 1 resonators to make a lvl 2. Three level 2's to make a 3. But you can only upgrade up to your current level, or cap of the items.  To code it would be simple and they'd just add it to the options:  Deploy, Upgrade, Recycle, Drop  Upgrading a mod, just like upgrading a resonator, would give you no added AP, so you couldn't abuse it, and an upgraded Heatsink would not reset the hack counter (only lower it to the new max time, if it's currently above it).  That was my idea before reading your example."

Ingress,3d5csb,ArtistEngineer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:26:08 2015 UTC,"This has been suggested over and over again. Although i fancy this feature, it'll never be implemented as it does indeed lead to ""entrenchment"" and some areas will become impenetrable. In a game that's all about attacking, this will never get implemented.  However, if you keep a portal dear, deploy your rarest shields on it and the next agents that come to upgrade it will (generally) not deploy common shields, but instead put at least rare or FA/TUR. Also, due to the ""stickyness"" stat on shields, don't worry if you deploy commons: they'll be the first to drop upon attack so you can later deploy (very)rares on the open mod slot - that is, if you're not dealing with an agent determined to capture the portal in question: in that case, it might be full of AXAs and that won't stop him/her.  As for the other suggestion: the ""transmutation"" of items, that, again, will never happen as it encourages static play: only have L5 portals in your area? no problem: farm the hell out of them and transmute to higher level items. Why bother acting social and reach out to the community to help you upgrade your nearby portals or get together to build an L8 farm? Need L4s?: no problem, transmute some L7s, instead of actually moving your lazy butt to capture an enemy portal, deploy 8-7-6-6-5 and glyph hack it for 5+ L4s.  What i would like to see (and could be implemented without serious gameplay changes) is some sort of capsule to act a purpose similar of a Horadric cube (for those old D2 fans :)). You could fill it with 100 xmp8 for instance then hit ""transmute"" for 50% chance to generate a flipcard or fill it with 100 R8 for 100% chance to generate a vr shield or AXA. Of course, transmute chances could be linked to the drop rate ratios between the ""reagents"" used and the ""transmuted"" item so as to not imbalance the game."

Ingress,3dcgex,MalachiDraven,3,Wed Jul 15 11:24:01 2015 UTC,"The beauty of ingress is that you can play as a lone wolf or you can make it a social experience.    A farm is simply getting enough players together to get many portals in an area to a certain level, and then proceed to hack and glyph hack them until they burn out.  The more dense an area the less you have to walk to farm the same amount of items, so in terms of you image up there, that piece of road looks ripe for a small farm.  This is done mostly by >L8 players, because you need 8 >L8 players to make a level 8 portal.  As of level 2 you can yourself only set so many resonators of a certain level on portals (i.e. as a level 2 you can fully own a portal with 4xL2 resos and 4xL1 resos).  This makes it hard to get a portal to your level by yourself (and thus obtaining mostly gear at your level), but not if you have help.  Up until level 4 you need just 1 extra player to make a full level 4 portal, but it varies depending what others contribute randomly.   Also, connecting with the local faction might get you help, in case you need someone higher up to quickly clean an area of opposition held portals that are too high for you to take down yourself, for you to cap, link and field to make AP fast and level up fast.  You are probably not the only player in your faction in your area.  Ask in faction comm for the g+ community for your faction in the area and connect with them."

For example there's an info plaque that's a portal, but then the park bench (dedicated in memory of someone passed) adjacent to the plaque is also a portal, and the playground they sit next to is also a portal, oh and so is the statue, and flower garden 20 steps away.  Is there a way to report these, is this something that should be reported?"
Ingress,3d5jy5,Pwnacus_Maximus,7,Mon Jul 13 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of moving game pieces from portal to portal along links. It would give some variety instead of just linking to create fields. I think Ingress has done something like this for anomalies, but it would be cool to see on a smaller scale that non-anomaly players could get involved in."
Ingress,3d5jy5,Paulrik,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:36 2015 UTC,Wasn't there a theory based on a tear down that they were looking into making movable glyph hack multipliers?
Ingress,3d5jy5,NEXT_VICTIM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:03:54 2015 UTC,I believe this was an idea that was mentioned by the ingress guys in an interview a loooooong time ago. Another I recall was tapping two phones with NFC to share some XM with another agent - to help level them I suppose.

Ingress,3d5jy5,VirtualVoidSK,4,Tue Jul 14 13:28:17 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with others, I really like this idea. A less crazy version of moving shards."
Ingress,3d5jy5,jitterfish,5,Tue Jul 14 09:23:04 2015 UTC,"And it has the benefit of introducing people to the concept behind shards, just on a local level"
Ingress,3d5jy5,deadlylemons,3,Tue Jul 14 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"I like this idea.  REALLY like it.  The distance rewards, however, may present an issue with the ""speed limit"" of the game, or might even make spoofing a more desirable cheat.  Something that could work is if the courier mission required a certain number of handoffs, i.e., the person who accepted the mission could not be the one to deliver the goods.  This would probably require an inventory object that would need to be passed from one agent to another in order to complete the mission.  AP could be awarded to each agent who participated in the mission.  A flat amount that is divided evenly, rounded up, to each agent would encourage people to participate.  The amount shouldn't be too high, but should be enough to encourage agents to play, in the same way that a CF is worth 1250 AP regardless of size."
Ingress,3d5jy5,sir_eldren,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:10:29 2015 UTC,I think a good way to prevent spoofing would be to time the missions and take note of player travel speed(if that's even possible). Spoofers would obviously stand out because they'd move without stopping and arrive very quickly. and I doubt that many people would slow down their spoofing to make it look realistic. that would take too much work.
Ingress,3d5jy5,DeathWish001,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:52:14 2015 UTC,"I want this mission. I wanted to do shard stuff. but I didn't want to fork over the moneys to travel. does niantic even read reddit? edit: the only issue I see, is the stupid anti-spoofing mechanic. driving 55 mph to your destination only to wait 5 to 15 min to get yourself unlocked."
Ingress,3d5jy5,LazyEyeQQ,3,Wed Jul 15 04:45:40 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting concept! I might even just try to implement this on a local level. I.E. send a notification to my local ingress group that if they drop a certain key at my office portal and message me between X hours then I'll drop X gear in return. This could be an interesting way to keep my office portal and surrounding area an 8 farm and allow me to farm certain keys without having to travel! Hope you don't mind me implementing this idea on a local level, heck if enough people started doing similar ""missions"" then Niantic might just go, ""hey that's an interesting idea, let's add it to the next release."" ."

For reference I loaded 6 MUFG capsules at the same time and checked on them about as often as I could. OC is your friend here.  I loaded two with 70 B8s and the other four with 25 items, ADA in one, Jarvis in another, AXA in another, CHS in the last.  So far the best producing has been the AXA with 8.

All your device does is pass the action to the server and displays the result.   If it was done client side then people could manipulate the client to return whatever items they desired.

Ingress,3d5erq,Tarasz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:46:05 2015 UTC,There is trade of - if you save items then you are using up lots of space since you need atleast 95 items in cap for a good return thus the more you stash the more inventory space you lose.  3 caps at max cap ~ 300 items space lost.  I like to build and destroy so I need more res and more bursters losing 300 items   Takes between 8-12 bursters to take down a portal and 8 to build so I look at it as ~ 15 portals I am not able to capture with a lose of 300 inventory items.
Ingress,3d5erq,Bownage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:16:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, I started wanting loads of mufg capsules, but you can have enough, if i hack more i'll share them with other smurfs.  You don't need 95 items in cap for good return, you need 95 for optimal use of 1 mufg.  45 items in 1 mufg and 50 items in another mufg yields the same as 95 in 1 mufg.  (as far as I know, we need more statistics)"

Ingress,3d9e7a,eric_twinge,5,Tue Jul 14 17:02:54 2015 UTC,I'm failing to see how giving attackers more options and ability is not buffing attacking.    I would also lay the blanket statement that I'm against any more additional items without even the tiniest increase in inventory space.

I've got a portal in my town that stays up fairly well because of that. I keep it charged and it hasn't been contested much because it's so difficult to take."
Ingress,3d9e7a,Paulrik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:49:37 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of a targeted ranged attack. If you sacrificed damage and splash radius for the ability to blast exactly where you want from a few blocks away, it might make things interesting. Im thinking of a rocket launcher, but Even if you fully zoom out on the scanner, it's not farther than you could walk in a few minutes, so it wouldn't give an attacker a huge advantage. A shielded portal would probably shrug off these attacks and an attacker would still need to move right close to a portal to capture it.   You could sell it as a safety feature too, removing the temptation for people to walk off cliffs or into rivers or over fences for those hard to reach resonators."

In this case you should plug it to the charger, then try to recover it by performing a hard reboot (on my Motorola, it's done by pressing the buttons volume-down and power, together, for a very long long time - and when the android prompt appears, use the volume up or down buttons to choose a normal boot up - DON'T choose the factory reset!!) and then it should finally be able to understand it's being plugged to a charger. Check the web on how to perform a hard reboot on your own phone, it's worth a try. [EDIT: oh wow, my first gilded comment! Thank you so much!!]"

For the last week (when it was already unable to run on the battery), it's been increasingly hard to get it to boot at all, requiring 5-10 minutes on the charger before it'll get through the boot without shutting off first. Once it was on, it seemed to work fine at least.  Edit: I did what you said (it's also VolDown+Power on the Nexus 4), then selected ""Reset Bootloader"", then ""Start"". This actually let the phone boot normally. Currently looking at my Home screen. THANK YOU!  I'm still not sure why the phone can get stuck this way, but evidently that reset did the trick!"

In our town where we have 6 active players, 3 of them got an MUFG within their first 50 hacks of it being available.

Ingress,3d57jm,SovietJugernaut,0,Tue Jul 14 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"The numbers I'm throwing out for radius may be in need of tweaking. Ingress is a very different game from a small town to a big metropolis.   As to the number of notifications, they would only be on portals with the mods and mods would be knocked off after the first attack, so there would be some limiting factors in place."
Ingress,3d57jm,hpizzy,8,Mon Jul 13 17:37:31 2015 UTC,Ingress is not a defensive game but all offense. Guardians were created as another badge primarily for rural players who do not get much activity.    Niantic does not want farms. Adding additional defense would create more farms.
Ingress,3d57jm,scatterbrain-d,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"This is certainly true of the game as it stands now. I would argue that the Guardian badge is a case where options for defensive play are lacking. The only viable strategy for players seeking that badge is to find an inaccessible portal hidden away somewhere and hope nobody ever finds it.   I agree, the game probably works well as a primarily offensive game, but what if instead of being 95%/5% offense/defense, it was only 80%/20% offense/defense."
Ingress,3d57jm,giritrobbins,2,Mon Jul 13 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"Guardian is the most negative and drama-inducing aspect of the game, and every time a new badge comes out it gets less and less relevant. Not to mention the scrapers on both sides. We don't need new features to support guardians; we need to just let the feature die out."
Ingress,3d57jm,fiberpunk,0,Tue Jul 14 03:15:58 2015 UTC,"I've opted out of pursuing the Guardian badge myself, it's a punishing game to get into. You really can't expect to ""keep"" a portal. Especially with scraping, it's just a matter of time before someone finds a portal, if its been sitting around long enough. The only ""strategy"" with guardians is to try to hide them, but they're not really hidden very well. The defensive game isn't really viable. I've tried, and in a few cases, my persistence wins out and an attacker will go focus his efforts elsewhere, but I know if he wants it bad enough, he'll take it. And I don't get to have those battles if the attack notification comes at a time when I can't instantly respond. I won't even start on butt hurt when the notification comes too late, but ouch, my butt."
Ingress,3d57jm,fiberpunk,7,Tue Jul 14 04:45:31 2015 UTC,I don't know what world you live in but even a linked portal with a single Axa isn't that easy to take down. This type of mod would also promote more runaway winning than the game already does.
Ingress,3d57jm,fiberpunk,-2,Mon Jul 13 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"You get a battle wagon together with 4 well equipped L8 agents, I don't think there's much you couldn't take down in less than a minute.   Now that's a lot of fire power, and a coordinated group of that size should be a force to be reckoned with, but my idea is to be able to rally a large defensive force that could have a chance of responding to a threat like that."
Ingress,3d57jm,fiberpunk,8,Mon Jul 13 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"The Sentry Mod would be instantly activated by any attack on the portal or it's resonators. It would trigger an attack notication for any players owning resonators on it   Server lag throws its head back and laughs at the concept of ""instant"" notifications.   all friendly players within a 10-50 km radius   This would be useless, unless they happened to have a key. I for one would not want attack notifications for a portal I'm not on and for which I don't have a key.   I'm not trying to rain on your parade, I just don't think that this works within the existing logistics of the game."
Ingress,3d57jm,fiberpunk,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"""Instant"" naturally means as fast as the servers are able to respond within the limitations of the communication infrastructure. This mod would only buy a little time. If a defender had minutes instead of seconds to respond to an attack, it could make portal defense a little more viable, with or without lag."
Ingress,3d57jm,sseeaannsseeaann,4,Mon Jul 13 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my point, though. Notifications now are supposedly ""instant"", but clearly they aren't most of the time due to lag. It's just the nature of the game. A new mod won't fix that issue."
Ingress,3d57jm,eric_twinge,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:41:32 2015 UTC,"It's a known limitation of the game, and I think it's why most players don't bother trying to defensively recharge portals. Usually by the time you get the alert, open the scanner, it's already too late.   This mod would buy enough time that you could reasonably have time to respond to a threat. A persistent attacker would still probably win out most of the time, but it might give a persistent defender a fighting chance."
Ingress,3d57jm,eric_twinge,2,Mon Jul 13 17:55:26 2015 UTC,This mod would buy enough time    But how? It's still subject to the same lag as everything else.
Ingress,3d57jm,banananon,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:03:09 2015 UTC,"Being triggered would make the portal invulnerable for a few minutes. The first attack would land, but then the attacker would need to wait before he could do any more damage."
Ingress,3d57jm,banananon,5,Mon Jul 13 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't get that part from your post. I'm really not sure if I like that. It won't really stop a determined attacker anyways, it would just make them sit there for however many minutes."
Ingress,3d57jm,banananon,-2,Mon Jul 13 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"No I, and I think a persistent attack should still win most battles for portal control. This wouldn't really change that, but it would give a persistent defender a little bit more of a fighting chance. Uncapturable portals would be game - breaking. I think if an attacker wants a portal bad enough, he'll take it sooner or later. This would just allow the defender the option of really making the attacker work for it."

This was a choice made by Niantic probably to either reduce required permissions or due to laziness of implementing it.  Unfortunately this means that submission images are not saved to the phone.

Ingress,3d1jux,ZachsMind,10,Sun Jul 12 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"a) ADA is in the scanner.  The original intro introduced her as such.  Jarvis added a patch to ENL scanners so that ADA would do your bidding without interfering and making blue resonators.  b) The game lore is like bad fan fiction written by a socially starved basement dweller.  I'm sure they think its great, but its so riddled with inconsistencies that the ""Shapers are a myth"" alternate theory is almost more credible. ;-P"

It sounds like the same voice, but it doesn't make any sense.   If that's the case, is it intentional or a goof on the part of the game designers to continue letting this character also direct us players around? I'd rather not have the character that tried to turn Klue's brain into swiss cheese telling me I did good dropping that resonator down. Not that I want Ms. Bailey out of a job, but I don't wanna blindly follow this voice if we have ingame evidence she likes to mess with people's heads.   Am I the only one?"
Ingress,3d1jux,perringaiden,4,Sun Jul 12 19:56:59 2015 UTC,"See my above reply: JARVIS during his first XM jaunt patched your scanner so that ADA can't alter your work and only does your bidding.  On the other hand there's another pet theory of mine that Glyphs are all ADA, even the ENL friendly ones, in an attempt to get us to understand the glyph meanings.  Because without understanding them, she can't mind hack us, as the glyphs would be meaningless."

Having a magical world is fine but one where the cost of entry is downloading  a free app is a stretch.   Disbelief suspension is pretty much always nessesary in games.

Ingress,3d1jux,MasterPython,-2,Sun Jul 12 20:05:45 2015 UTC,"Good point.   Altho.. ingame encumbrance is not a problem with this game. In fact I have to suspend disbelief that we can't hold more than two thousand virtual objects which have no weight and take up no space. Oh, and we can't pick up more virtual items right now cuz the portal is ""too hot"" in a virtual space where temperature is more of a metaphor I'm assuming for more disbelief suspension.   So the mythos held up until they started. So it's never held up and nobody expects it to start. It is essentially worse than Doctor Who. I love Doctor Who. Just saying..   I have been attempting up until now to like the Ingress mythos, but I can hop on the bandwagon of hating it too, i guess. I'd rather not, but is that more fun? I don't find ignoring the mythos to be entertaining, but embracing it isn't working for me either. I can try openly mocking and despising it for awhile. Does that work for you guys?"

As I said in the post I've had people test this out and had the results return true so if you question this I dont blame you and you can also test it out yourself for more confirmation. I hope they did change it though because this'll make guardian hunting so much harder."
Ingress,3cxpl0,eric_twinge,2,Sat Jul 11 18:55:31 2015 UTC,this'll make guardian hunting so much harder.   How so?
Ingress,3cxpl0,mrmessiah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:19:26 2015 UTC,"By the sounds of it, everyone could be telling the truth.  If you have resos on a guardian, your Max Time Portal Held stat in Agent stats will count up.  As Niantic say there if someone upgrades all your resos your Max Time Portal Held stat in Agent stats will stop visibly counting up.   But the counter for that portal does invisibly keep counting because if you can upgrade a reso on it the Max Time Portal Held stat catches up. This happened to me once a few months back.  But if OP is right it sounds as though if the invisible counter goes over where youd earn a medal you still get that medal. Realistically this makes sense - imagine your guardian got 8 rolled and you werent able to upgrade.  Not saying this is definitely true but just saying it could be."

Ingress,3cxpl0,lewisbarthaud,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:53:06 2015 UTC,your guardian is probably in fact another portal that you don't know about or have forgotten about - easily done since capture dates are gone from intel map - some kind Agent has probably been charging a portal without you realising..

I've been pretty confused over which is actually counting toward guardian for me because of it, haha. But it's really nice to have outside confirmation, so if I lose one of 'em I can rest easy.

For all the times players are accused of cheating, I suspect most of the time it's not actually happening. I think deliberately using lag to fire 10 XMPs at once is kind of a grey area. On the one hand, it's just how the game plays, especially with a poor internet connection, and spamming the fire XMP button isn't really a complex attack strategy. It would be impossible to proove a player was cheating, as most of things at play here are limitations of the technology that this game operates on.   On the other hand knowing about these limitations and deliberately  exploiting them is, in spirit, a kind of cheating.  But even without cheating, defending portals is usually a lot harder than smashing them. In the time it takes to receive a notification, open up your scanner, and start defensive recharging, even a shielded portal could be smashed and fully deployed on."

Your method is really convoluted compared to a simple mechanism that just says ""every 6 hours every item in a capsule has a 0.01% chance of replicating"", iterated over all items and all MUFG capsules. Where is the evidence that it's any more complex than that?"
Ingress,3cxp7z,theunknownjames,4,Sat Jul 11 20:33:08 2015 UTC,Sooner or later we will be using XM to mess with the seed of NIA's RNG.
Ingress,3cxp7z,Sakuya_Lv9,3,Sun Jul 12 06:31:54 2015 UTC,"This is my current thinking as well. Niantic has traditionally implemented simple, straightforward rules for various game mechanics. In this case, my guess is that the system simply iterates over each item in an MUFG capsule and ""rolls the dice"". That's all. Nothing to do with player activity level, rarity of items, how long you've held on to the capsule, last time you were logged in, etc., etc. All that means more computational load, and Niantic already seems to be struggling with that."
Ingress,3cxp7z,Recyart,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"My method is convoluted to show how complex (and impossible it to figure out) that it could be.  When I first got it, I had around 50x8 in one, and 24 hours later got a gain of 5x8.   That's really high for such a low payout as ""all capsules have a low chance of reproducing"", though that's how RNG works..."
Ingress,3cxp7z,theunknownjames,4,Sun Jul 12 13:03:20 2015 UTC,"But why would it be that complex?  Why not just a simple probability per item per interest cycle?  The capacity for Ingress players to take simple probability events (such as hack rates, shield stickiness or MUFG replication) and imagine unnecessarily complicated algorithms (player classes, shield curing and your lottery dynamic respectively) based on zero evidence never fails to amaze me.."
Ingress,3cxp7z,SovietJugernaut,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"Seriously. In the past couple of ""I hacked this"" threads, I've seen players suggest that some players get more of a certain item type than others by design (laughable), that the brand/model of phone affects the RNG returns (laughable), that droprates for flipcards and VR hack mods are 1:300 (no, they aren't) etc., etc., all without any actual data.  It's 3 parts frustrating and 1 part amusing how strictly people adhere to their completely unsubstantiated pet theories that they made up."

Ingress,3cxp7z,hpizzy,4,Sat Jul 11 19:13:07 2015 UTC,"My thought is Random Number Generator - like a 18 way dice with x(0) x(1) x(2) and x(3)s on it.   I have 3 capsules - placed same item + quantity in each at the same time.   After 24 hrs - 2 capsules had an addition of 1 item each.   Capsules reset again to same items + quantity.   After another 24 hours - all three capsules generated however this time - 1 capsule had 2 items while the other 2 had 1 item.  Capsules reset again to same items + quantity  After another 24 hours - 1 capsule had items the other 2 had nothing   this time did not reset capsules and after 24 hours  All three capsules had 1 item each.   So my theory is the RNG has so many 0's - 1's - 2's and 3's that it rolls on that that's what you get.   I repeated the tests with capsules this time with same item counts but 2 different items of the same type in each - 10axa, 10VR shields in all three.   Results after 24 hours Cap 1 - 1 additional axa Cap 2 - 0 Cap 3 - 1 additional VR  Reset all items counts - Removed all additional items  Results after 24 hours Cap 1 - 1 additional VR Cap 2 - 1 Axa Cap 3 - 1 Axa  Reset all items counts - Removed all additional items  Results after 24 hours Cap1 - 0 Cap2 - 1 axa Cap3 - 0  Reset all items counts - Removed all additional items Cap1 - 2 axa Cap2 - 1 axa Cap3 - 0  So this is why I think it's a random number between 0 and 3 and depending on the roll you get what the roll is."
Ingress,3cxp7z,theunknownjames,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:45:56 2015 UTC,"That's not really what people mean when they talk about random number generators. In the case of games like this, it typically just means a function which, when given a probability, returns true or false in proportion with that probability based on a random number sequence in the backend..."
Ingress,3cxp7z,invertedspear,3,Sun Jul 12 16:05:14 2015 UTC,Dropping has nothing to do with anything. I haven't dropped mine at all and it continues to produce at a regular rate.
Ingress,3cxp7z,Dagmar_dSurreal,2,Sat Jul 11 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"I've personally come to the conclusion that Niantic has figured out how to create an RNG that is biased towards when drops will irritate me the most.  I've spent many an hour glyph hacking the hell out of portal after portal, and gotten three MUFG capsules to drop so far.  When have they dropped?  Well, one actually dropped while I was glyph hacking.  The other two dropped when I was casually hacking a few (less than eight, actually) select portals on my way back home.  That kinda looks like the RNG making trollfaces at me.  For certain I have not seen even one new VR heat sink or VR multihack come out of these things.  A few days ago I reshuffled the inventories so that one capsule contains (for instance) 12 keys (three each from four portals), one contains 8 VRHS, one contains 5 VRMHs, and the other has ADAs, Jarvises, Derp Amps, and AXAs.  In the last three days that's yielded two viruses and one extra key.  By comparison, glyph hacking has yielded twice as many viruses (and keys are just ridiculously easy to obtain on-site).  Troooolfaces.  Still, I feel that with respect to VRHS/VRMH ""statistically maybe"" is an improvement over ""statistically never""."
Ingress,3cxp7z,sseeaannsseeaann,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:27:10 2015 UTC,I've got a capsule with 10 VRMH at the very beginning which has produced +2 so far.
Ingress,3cxp7z,theunknownjames,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree that they've somehow been able to design a generator that programmatically trolls the users.. I got my second MUFG while I was hacking an anchor for a key I desperately needed. Took eight hacks to get that key, and getting an MUFG first was the only conceivable scenario in which its appearance was unwelcome to me.. Incredible feat of trolling.."

Ingress,3cxp7z,nels_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:54:32 2015 UTC,"Seeing as its Niantic and they are lazy in every other aspect of the game, it's probably something like a low (1%ish) chance to duplicate each item in a cap every x hours, rolled on an individual basis. Matches up with what I've observed but time will tell"
Ingress,3cxp7z,CaptainGilliam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:39:39 2015 UTC,"I should review my history (because I'm maintaining a history kinda like a transaction history for your bank account) and I've got a lot more interests on vr items than common items.  My conclusion is not to use these capsules for common items, it's a waste of time and space. Glyphing a portal is more productive.  As for rare/very rare items, I suppose it depends on how often you use them. I think these capsules are fantastic for flipping cards. I don't use them often and I'm really running on interests right now."

Making long, random links blocks others from fielding. If you just make tiny links to the very next portal, that's cool.  The further you stand from the portal the more spread out your resonators will be.  If you want a second key to a certain portal, you have to drop the one you have or stick it in a capsule. Then hack, and maybe you'll get another key.  If you want to have fun, when a RES agent shows up, hide in the bushes. Make them play hide and seek. Then when they're about to quit, say hello. Be friendly to the enemy, but don't forget to fight."

One portal turned blue again with stronger resonators right after I turned it gray, before i could throw down a green res myself. Like they were perched nearby waiting. In the crowd I saw no indicators of other players. Practically everybody had a cellphone in hand but thats not enough to assume. I was the wind, but they were ghosts."

While you're in the lower levels, look for a handful of unclaimed portals together in an interesting area that you and your daughters can go and claim and link up to create fields. That's the fastest way to be awarded AP and 'level up'.  Fighting enemy portals isn't terribly rewarding when you are levels 1, 2, or 3 really so play with fields first. I believe they call it 'flinging noodles' - No damage done, and you soon get bored and go home :)"
