This is when I had my first legal beer and on a whim I chose Monteith's Golden Lager.  I don't know if it was the fact it was my first legal beer, or just getting off a 14 hour flight, or if it was a legitimately good beer but that was the best tasting beer I've ever had to this day. I've been searching for this beer for years in the US and can't find any imports.  Here's a picture from that lunch with my dad. I'm doing that pose because it had been hours since we last ate and the first thing my mom wants to do when the food comes is put down everything and take a picture.

It is amazing.  It has enough pumpkin that you can enjoy it, but not too much to be overwhelmed. Every year I wiggle in excitement over my first sip of Night Owl."

It's also quite reasonably priced, I'd say.  When partying it up and looking for something cheap and tasty, we're all about Grain Belt Nordeast. It's perfect for a round of Beeriokart."

New Belgium's Mothership was my favorite, it was just so refreshing and tasted great, exactly everything I like about a beer, this beer had. Unfortunately, New Belgium has discontinued this beer, and my heart is broken. I haven't been able to find it in Nashville in a very long time, so I'm still searching for that perfect beer.

Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,3doduh,arlington_hick,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:44:30 2015 UTC,"Narragansett.  Now, I am a native Rhode Islander so everyone drinks it but it is also the only thing I have left of my grandparents. It is the only connection my old man and I have. It is the bond that sometimes holds together my dysfunctional family. It's not that we're alcoholics or anything, it's that we simply don't know how to express our love.  Sure, there are other good beers. Sam Adams always tastes good as does the other local RI breweries (Full Sail Brewery, The Bucket Brewery and heck, even Newport Storm). I don't mind the big boys either (Miller High Life was my choice earlier this week.  But when life seems like crap, I can say ""hey neighbor! Have a Gansett!"" and everything will be fine. Because those five simple words do more to a person in this state than any other words in the English dictionary.  Because after work, sometimes it's just knowing someone cares enough to get you a beer.  Because after a long week, all you want to do is put your feet up and drink a cold Gansett.  Because some nights, at the bowling alley, you want to spend a couple of bucks and have a Cold Tall Boy.  Because nothing goes better with pizza than Narragansett.  Narragansett - The drink of choice."
