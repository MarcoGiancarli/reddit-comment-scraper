BattlePaintings,3d2wfr,False-God,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"first result.   George Grosz’s paintings, from both before and after World War I, depict German society in the throes of violent destruction. Grosz had a mental breakdown and was discharged from the army as “permanently unfit” the year he made this painting. Glass, bricks, and people fly through the air in a city rent by an apparent bomb attack. A bird’s-eye view shows chaos unfolding as buildings pinwheel around the center of impact. The composition is disorienting, but the color reverberates outward in vibrant and geometric plumes, lending structure and beauty to an otherwise riotous scene of destruction."
BattlePaintings,3d2wfr,zebrazoly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's on the border of being a ""battle painting,"" it's more of an abstract, apocalyptic vision inspired by war. Grosz was a left-wing German (his overtly political stuff is straight savage.)  It's all part of my scheme to subvert /r/BattlePaintings and turn it away from the all the ploddingly literal academic stuff, you see."

BattlePaintings,39q9cr,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:27:42 2015 UTC,"Battle of Camperdown:       The Battle of Camperdown (known in Dutch as the Zeeslag bij Kamperduin) was a major naval action fought on 11 October 1797,  between a Royal Navy fleet under Admiral Adam Duncan and a Dutch Navy fleet under Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter. The battle was the most significant action between British and Dutch forces during the French Revolutionary Wars and resulted in a complete victory for the British, who captured eleven Dutch ships without losing any of their own. In 1795, the Dutch Republic had been overrun by the army of the French Republic and had been reorganised into the Batavian Republic, a French client state. In early 1797, after the French Atlantic Fleet had suffered heavy losses in a disastrous winter campaign, the Dutch fleet was ordered to reinforce the French at Brest. The rendezvous never occurred; the continental allies failed to capitalise on the Spithead and Nore mutinies that paralysed the British Channel forces and North Sea fleets during the spring of 1797.

BattlePaintings,39hf0s,I-am-Gizmoduck,7,Thu Jun 11 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"Battle of Bazeilles, if we really want to be specific. Part of the greater fighting around Sedan, but not quite the main gig. The main battle is usually portrayed as much more of an artillery battle, not so much urban warfare.   Interesting sidenote: Bazeilles is usually credited for the widespread German fear of franc-tireurs in the occupied territories in WW1, and the absolutely ruthless suppression policies they utilize to mitigate that perceived threat."
BattlePaintings,39hf0s,Schuultz,6,Fri Jun 12 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"I think so, not sure a 100% considering these uniforms are really close to the ones used in the first months of WW1"
BattlePaintings,39hf0s,titoup,6,Thu Jun 11 20:14:37 2015 UTC,This is the fascinating thing about WW1 is that most armies at the time still used uniforms and some equipment that wouldn't have looked out of the ordinary in the franco-prussian war time. The british and french didn't even switch from cloth caps to steel helmets until a couple months in the war becasue head injuries were becoming a significant problem and their german counterparts were slightly ahead of the game in that category (like they were in most things at the beginning of the war)
BattlePaintings,39hf0s,RagingTyrant74,6,Thu Jun 11 22:50:42 2015 UTC,"A few months? Try two years. The Germans introduced the M1916 in... well... 1916.

In such a battle, you cannot well endure such periods of time always going at 110%."

Although, actually, looking more closely I see there is a wounded man lying on the bed behind him, so perhaps he has just turned to see what is going on at the window. Still, the hands-in-pockets casual attitude strikes me as a bit odd. He looks as though he's mentally critiquing the actions of the men scrabbling for cartridges and thinking ""Bah, I could do better than this, but why should I help such idiots?"""
