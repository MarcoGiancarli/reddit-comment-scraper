funk,3e3q42,Jenkinsagna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:07 2015 UTC,Seriously listen to this whole album. It's maybe a little folky and a little less funky but if you like Bill Withers or Otis Redding then you'll like this.  It's a sound right out of the 70s.   It's such nice music.
funk,3e3y1a,Ovulating_Oyster,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not sure what genre it falls under but the closest think has to be funk/disco. It's not a super obscure song though, but it is from a while back (maybe 70's-90's). I hear it played all the time but can never name it."

Check out Fred, and other musicians you like (they don't have to be trombonists- what about saxophonists Fred played with, like Maceo or Pee Wee Ellis?) and learn the vocabulary they're using. You build a sound by crafting your own out of imitation."

funk,3a71jf,phishdrix04,4,Wed Jun 17 20:19:28 2015 UTC,wwoz form new orleans! they've also got their own internet radio app i think
funk,3a71jf,cr4y0nb0x,2,Wed Jun 17 20:25:22 2015 UTC,"89.1 kmhd, 10pm to 12am pst on saturday nights. It's really specific but a lot of good stuff."
funk,3a71jf,digdesign,2,Thu Jun 18 02:29:41 2015 UTC,"Mix Cloud is a good place to find radio shows.  Mansion Lane uploads some incredible mixes  https://www.mixcloud.com/mansionlane/  I also like Jazzie B.  https://www.mixcloud.com/jazziebobe/    Another site I like is trntbl.me, it aggregates tracks from Tumblr users and creates a playlist that you can listen to straight through. These are a couple of users that I like.  http://www.trntbl.me/funksoul  http://www.trntbl.me/dixiefunk"

funk,3a71jf,boredop,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:41:29 2015 UTC,"They're not 24/7 funk, but WWOZ in New Orleans often gives it up. Every Saturday night from 8 to 10pm US central time DJ Soul Sister hosts the Soul Power show, featuring the funkiest rare grooves you can ever hope to hear. They also do a New Orleans music show on weekday afternoons with a good number of local funk bands (but lots of other styles too)."
funk,3a55q4,Lunaticerific,3,Wed Jun 17 08:46:42 2015 UTC,This whole album is so great.
funk,3a55q4,sheven,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:57:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for bringing this band to my attention!
funk,3a55q4,Melkor_Morgoth,3,Fri Jun 19 16:23:44 2015 UTC,No problem! They're one of the best.
funk,3a55q4,Melkor_Morgoth,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't follow this posted link. I looked for it later on YouTube, and I fumble-fingered something and heard ""Slide"" from their first album first. I was digging it, and then that guitar break about a third of the way in hit, and I knew these guys were real deal. I marathon'd them this afternoon and listened to most stuff from the first album through Stone Jam. Really liked everything I heard."
funk,3a4tqo,cnc123cnc,2,Wed Jun 17 06:03:56 2015 UTC,These guys are incredibly fun to see live. There wasn't a point in the show where the crowd wasn't dancing. Their jams get incredibly hypnotic.
funk,3a4tqo,SourMoonBlues,2,Wed Jun 17 06:27:17 2015 UTC,Hell yes I have seen them in New Orleans twice and both times it was incredible

funk,39wfdu,westsyde57,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:27:31 2015 UTC,Yeah this song is much less funky than their other tracks
funk,39wfdu,beermad,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"For my money, this was the point when my all-time favourite band lost the funk completely. Better than average disco, but definitely not funk."
