No matter how long ago the complainers moved here, whether they are one of the new folks from SF or have been here their whole life, the fact is this church has almost certainly been around longer, and hopefully is here to stay.    I can't even count how many new people have moved into my apartment building that work in the city and say with no hesitation the only reason they live in Oakland is because the rent is so cheap. They really don't seem to like it here as it is, and upon moving immediately try to change a neighborhood, that's been established for years, to something that more closely fits their vision."

In this case, I disagree in practice: I live on the same block as the Humanist Hall and have literally never had an issue with their noise. For the record, I hear plenty of shit: Fireworks all the time;  fire trucks leaving the fire department; ambulances racing up to Kaiser and Summit; drunks on 27th; drunks outside of the Porno Bar; drunks leaving the pool hall ... No one can pretend this is a quiet street, but for real, the Humanist Hall is actually the least of the noise issues on this block."

I've been in this same apartment since '11, so that's the timeframe I'm familiar with.   If I had to guess, I would say that people feel comfortable making noise complaints against a weirdo church venue, whereas, they may not feel comfortable or have recourse to complain about other noise complaints (public services like ambulances and fire department or trash and construction).  The fact that people have been complaining of noise at the Humanist Hall since 2005 doesn't mean that it is the only noisy thing on the block, or that it's even the noisiest thing on the block. For example. I know I complained about early morning Waste Management trash pick-ups, construction before 8 am at the family court building, and I've also called the cops about what I perceived to be domestic violence/gun violence on my block. Like I said, it's a noisy block. And people complain:it's part of living in a city, in close quarters to other folks. My view is that the Humanist Hall folks are generally respectful neighbors, and I have no quarrel with them."

oakland,3e2lhj,oaklandisfun,16,Tue Jul 21 13:58:05 2015 UTC,"There's some misinformation in this article, in particular the way it downplays the role of eucalyptus trees in the 1991 fire.  Here's what the official report on the fire says:   The heaviest fuel loading would probably have occurred in the untreated eucalyptus stands. Some estimates indicate fuel loading in these areas from 30 to 50 tons per acre. Additionally, heavy fuel accumulations would have occurred in the location of the brush lands.   The eucalyptus trees were cited as a major contributing factor in the fire, not because the trees themselves burned, but because of the ""tremendous production of both leaf and bark litter, which is not readily consumed or broken down in the normal decomposition process and leads to the presence of high volumes of fuel.""  The HuffPo article is correct that the clearcutting won't eliminate this fuel overnight, and in fact will make it worse for a short period of time. But over the long term it should lower overall fuel loads in the hills. It will not, however, eliminate all risks from fire, though.   The Berkeley Hills are part of what is known as a fire ecosystem. By stopping the natural and necessary cycle of wildfire humans have put their houses at great risk. The only way to mitigate that risk is to act in the role that the fire would have played by clearcutting and mulching to reduce the fuel load in the way the FEMA plan prescribes."
oakland,3e2lhj,unpickle,6,Tue Jul 21 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Also not mentioned in the article that's crucial in understanding how fire cycles work, especially in California, is the fact that low grass burns low and quick without causing taller more established flora to catch fire. With the eucalyptus, there's far more litter on the ground to stoke larger fires that can consume whole trees. This will invariably lead to larger, more devastating fires"

(The more I read about this, I realize that I'm going to sound like I'm resistant to the other side of the debate... but really I just want to know more.  Its frustrating trying to find information here because both sides are talking past each other and have various contradictory claims)  As for the fire risk, I'm not an expert but just pulling from Wikipedia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus#Fire_hazard   a eucalyptus forest tends to promote fire because of the volatile and highly combustible oils produced by the leaves, as well as the production of large amounts of litter which is high in phenolics, preventing its breakdown by fungi and thus accumulates as large amounts of dry, combustible fuel. Reid, J.B. & Potts, B.M. (2005). Eucalypt Biology. In: Reid et al. (eds.) Vegetation of Tasmania., pp. 198-223. Australian Government.   In a later comment, the author claims that the trees were barriers to the 1991 Oakland Fire. But the author quotes a non-expert for this statement.  Then quotes the Chief of Fire Prevention that says,  ""Fire Science has proven that every living tree -- regardless of its species -- due to its moisture content and canopy coverage of ground fuels, contributes to wildfire hazard mitigation.""  But Reid and Potts say that its not the trees themselves that are the hazard, its the oily dead bark and leaves on the ground.   Almost thirty years before the Oakland firestorm of 1991, a study of eucalyptus in the area warned that the litter beneath the trees builds up very rapidly and should be regularly monitored and removed.[23] It has been estimated that 70% of the energy released through the combustion of vegetation in the Oakland fire was due to eucalyptus.[24] In a National Park Service study, it was found that the fuel load (in tons per acre) of non-native eucalyptus woods is almost three times as great as native oak woodland.   Maybe I'm out of my depth here, but just because Miller planted these trees 150 years ago doesn't mean they were a good idea.  The original Oaks and Redwoods were cut as Americans migrated to California, why didn't Miller re-establish those native species?  And why don't we do that now?  This is the land of Redwoods and Oak.  Both sides are against deforestation, so what about a plan that is pro-forestation-- just of the old species?    p.s.-- another article with the Gertrude Stein quote. sigh"
oakland,3e2lhj,scottfarrar,4,Tue Jul 21 17:29:22 2015 UTC,The eucalyptus was largely a lumber scheme.  They were not part of some grand reforestation done out of the goodness of anyones heart.  Miller may have reforested his land around his home but that's not the reason for the pervasiveness of the eucalyptus.
oakland,3e2lhj,iratesquirrel,2,Tue Jul 21 18:53:06 2015 UTC,Most of the areas in question likely never had redwoods but were open grassland or oak savanna. The Ohlone set controlled fires to prevent shrubs and overgrowth from inhibiting oak regeneration.

A 12-year-old plan to develop the 1.3 acre lot at 71st Avenue and Snell Street into a transit village has stalled even though the city continues to earmark funds for the project. Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle A BART train pulls into the Coliseum station behind a parking lot filled to capacity in Oakland, Calif. on Thursday, April 30, 2015. A 12-year-old plan to develop the 1.3 acre lot at 71st Avenue and Snell Street into a transit village has stalled even though the city continues to earmark funds for the project.  The idea was ambitious: To give hundreds of impoverished families in East Oakland a chance to live in stylish apartments near a BART station, in a part of town long known for crime and desolation.  City Councilman Larry Reid has pushed the plan since 2003, when he co-founded a nonprofit charity, the Oakland Economic Development Corp., to make it happen. Two years later, the charity persuaded the city to grant it exclusive rights to pursue a housing development in the parking lot of the Coliseum BART Station. The Oakland Economic Development Corp. had no experience in taking on a project, yet in 2013, Reid and his colleagues on the City Council voted to give the group $400,000 in public funds so it could forge ahead.  Now that public money is gone, the transit village appears to be dead, and the city stands to lose an $8.5 million state grant if the village isn’t built by October 2017.  Records show the group spent all $400,000 in city funds and lost its federal charitable tax-exempt status, which city officials say must be reinstated for the project to move forward. Meanwhile, the exclusive agreement the nonprofit signed with Oakland to pursue the project expired.  Questions about whether the nonprofit could pull off the project had been building even as the city invested its hopes and money in the group. The nonprofit’s business address was its president’s home address. Its listed board of directors included people who told The Chronicle they had little or nothing to do with the nonprofit.

Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle A parking lot is filled to capacity at the Coliseum BART station in Oakland, Calif. on Thursday, April 30, 2015. A 12-year-old plan to develop the 1.3 acre lot at 71st Avenue and Snell Street into a transit village has stalled even though the city continues to earmark funds for the project.  Big blow  The Oakland Economic Development Corp. — formed by Reid, local attorney James Head and others — began with a lofty goal to blanket a swath of public land around the Coliseum BART Station with hundreds of apartments and more than 10,000 square feet of retail, plans that would have required a $35 million subsidy from the city.  But over the years, the nonprofit hit obstacles. Its original developer partner, the Bay Area real estate firm MacFarlane Partners, bowed out. The housing market flopped in the economic crash of 2008, making it difficult to secure investments.  The biggest blow came in 2011, when the state dissolved city redevelopment agencies, which had long bankrolled real estate projects that depended on public subsidies. That year, the nonprofit partnered with another local developer, UrbanCore, and scaled back the transit village to 110 apartments and about 1,500 square feet of retail on a 1.3-acre parcel — a fragment of the original idea.  By then, the Oakland Economic Development Corp. had stopped filing its federal tax forms, and in May 2013, the Internal Revenue Service revoked the group’s charitable status after it failed to file taxes for at least three years.

To this day, the nonprofit has not won back its charitable status, has no website, and lists its address as a residence in the Oakland hills belonging to Head, the group’s president. It also has nothing else in its portfolio: Bolden said it was formed with the sole purpose of clinching the transit village deal.  Yet, despite the setbacks and lack of a track record, the group had unwavering support at Oakland City Hall and from the philanthropic community.  In 2005, when Head was in charge of the Oakland Economic Development Corp., he was also program director at the San Francisco Foundation, and that year the foundation awarded the Oakland Economic Development Corp. a $30,000 grant to pursue the Coliseum Transit Village. Head says he was not involved in disbursing the grant. Last year, he took on a new post as chief executive officer of the East Bay Community Foundation, the largest philanthropic organization in the East Bay. He also remains chief at the Oakland Economic Development Corp.  Generous terms  In 2013, when the City Council awarded the Oakland Economic Development Corp. public funding for the transit village, it came in the form of a $400,000 loan with generous terms: no interest, 55 years to pay it back, and a promise that the group wouldn’t have to pay anything until the transit village was finished and generating revenue."
oakland,3dz6zi,noalias,5,Mon Jul 20 19:13:39 2015 UTC,"Erroneous information  Council members who approved the loan that summer had received a city staff report that erroneously called the group a tax-exempt nonprofit. The city’s report also praised the group’s board of directors for having “economic development expertise from the business, government, nonprofit and community sectors of Oakland.”  Yet, among the individuals Head listed that same year as board members in filings with California’s Registry of Charitable Trusts are two who told The Chronicle they had not been associated with the group for years.  “That’s news to me,” a city employee named Douglas Cole said when told he was listed as a board member. He said he was drafted for the board more than a decade ago and attended only three meetings early on. “I’d forgotten about it. I didn’t know it was still intact.”  Bishop Bob Jackson of Acts Full Gospel Church in Oakland was also surprised to be listed as a board member. “I haven’t been a part of that in a long time,” Jackson said.  Another listed board member, Robert Harris, a retired attorney for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., said he last met with the board for a 2014 tour of the transit village site.  One board member did not return calls, another hung up the phone when told the purpose of the call, and two more could not be located.  Asked to explain the seeming nonexistence of his board, Head e-mailed a new list of seven people. Cole and Jackson were off the list and the only new name was Ed Fitzpatrick, a luxury car dealer who could not be reached for comment.  Funds exhausted  By January 2015, the Oakland Economic Development Corp. had spent every penny of its $400,000 loan, which came from bonds earmarked for Coliseum-area development. More than half the funds paid for environmental, traffic and parking studies to determine the viability of the project.  About a quarter of the loan, $104,000, was paid to Michael Johnson, president of the project’s partner development firm, UrbanCore. Much of the rest went to pay for lobbyists and consultants, including Bolden, who took $18,000.  Reid, who made the motion to award the loan at the City Council meeting in 2013, said he is not active with the group he founded. Records show that his chief of staff is copied on e-mail correspondence related to the transit village between October 2013 and June 2014.  Reid characterizes his role as that of a political advocate, campaigning for the project because he wants African Americans to build real estate projects in their own neighborhoods. He says the Coliseum Transit Village was modeled after a transit village in Fruitvale that Oakland built in partnership with the Spanish-Speaking Unity Council.  “It gave African Americans a sense of hope that they could be part of the changing landscape of our city,” Reid said. If Latinos could spruce up their neighborhood with a BART transit village, he said, then African Americans could do the same.  California conflict-of-interest law bars elected officials from voting on projects from which they will financially benefit, and Reid said he has never profited from the transit village development. He also says that although he was a founder, he holds no position on the organization’s board.  His involvement, he says, is driven by a desire to see improvements in his district. Reid and other council members said it is not unusual for Oakland elected officials to help facilitate projects in the areas they represent.  BART’s reaction  Reid recently attended a meeting with members of the development team, city staffer Larry Gallegos and Robert Raburn, the elected member of BART’s Board of Directors who oversees the Coliseum Station. At that meeting, the developers asked for a ground lease for the parking lot and proposed that their first payment be deferred by about 10 years, Raburn said.  Raburn didn’t bite. “At the end of our meeting, they dropped their numbers on me,” he recalled. “I said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding.’”  For now, development of the Coliseum Transit Village is stalled. Gallegos, who has continued working on the project even after the city’s agreement with the Oakland Economic Development Corp. expired in January, says the development team is trying to secure financing.  As for why he has continued to work on the development despite the expired agreement and the nonprofit’s tax problem, Gallegos said he and other officials are “very much interested” in advancing the project. City officials had already invested “considerable” time and a $400,000 loan on the deal, he said.  The city also does not want to lose the $8.5 million state grant, Gallegos said.  Program ending  The grant is non-transferrable to another project and if Oakland loses it, it will be unable to get another because the program, based on the 2006 voter-approved Proposition 1C, is ending. Prop. 1C was a $2.9 billion bond measure to raise public funds for affordable housing and urban development near transit hubs and is managed by the state Department of Housing and Community Development.  “We’ve tried to be very flexible and work with them,” said state Housing and Community Development spokeswoman Evan Gerberding.  Meanwhile, momentum to improve the area around the Coliseum has been building. In March, the City Council approved a new zoning plan for 800 acres near the Coliseum BART Station. The area is primed to be a new urban center, and out-of-town speculators are vying for portions of the land.  “Let’s face it,” Raburn said. “A lot of people are coming in and saying they’d love to have a project around the BART station ... a lot of it is foreign capital.”  Raburn said he liked the idea of building housing around a BART station, and he also liked working with a community group that would “keep the money local.”  But Raburn also said it’s important to vet any plan before BART signs a lease. The parking lot generates money for BART, and Raburn doesn’t want to see it squandered.  “We’re not going to just give away public land,” he said.

oakland,3dz6zi,aplomba,2,Mon Jul 20 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, that's probably a bit too harsh. I think the bigger issue is this:   Reid characterizes his role as that of a political advocate, campaigning for the project because he wants African Americans to build real estate projects in their own neighborhoods. He says the  Coliseum Transit Village was modeled after a transit village in Fruitvale that Oakland built in partnership with the Spanish-Speaking Unity Council   Although that's an understandable impulse, structural and demographic factors ensure there are going to be few to no developers who are a) local to Oakland, b) African-American, and c) interested in non-profit development*.  If you insist on only using people who satisfy those three criteria, the odds of them also being well-funded, experienced, and/or competent are low.    *I actually live in a condo building developed, in part, by a Oakland-based African-American developer. He has seemed like a solid person on the occasions I've met him, but he's clearly less well-funded than many outside builders and is not active in the non-profit space."
oakland,3dz6zi,Ochotona_Princemps,2,Mon Jul 20 20:18:07 2015 UTC,"I find this thought fascinating and am wondering if you could elaborate on the structural and demographic factors you refer to. If you don't want to do it here, feel free to DM me."
oakland,3dz6zi,VaughnVapor,7,Tue Jul 21 02:26:30 2015 UTC,"Oakland has 400,000-ish people, of which only 25% are African-American. That cuts the pool to 100,000.  I can't find Oakland specific data, but the national African-American labor force participation rate is 61.7%. I could see Oakland's figure being higher (the city is a magnet for professional class African-Americans) or lower (lots of entrenched poverty in the flats), but let's take the national average as a decent guesstimate. That cuts the pool to 61,700 or so.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't have employment figures for ""real estate developer"", but it does have a category for ""Real Estate- Top Executives"". That probably captures more than just developers, but let's go with it. As of May 2014, that category accounted for .02% of all jobs.  That gives a expected number of Oakland-based, African-American developers of about 14, a pretty tiny group. Moreover, given the intense, systemic discrimination against African-Americans in both the past and present, it is almost certainly the case that African-Americans are underrepresented among real estate developers, making the total number even lower.    So it seems very unlikely that there is a robust pool of black, local nonprofit developers."

oakland,3dwrxm,spinlock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"I started at this gym a few weeks ago after hearing about Tufunga in a previous thread.  I like it because it is no frills strength training facility. I'm in three times a week and from what I can tell half the people in there are with trainers. It isn't super busy, but I have normally used a home gym so don't have a lot of reference.  Pricing is $45 a month without a trainer, $40 with. There is a one-time $55 initiation fee.  From what I could find in my area, that is pretty competitive pricing for gyms with free weights in the area.   The place has a more casual, non-corporate feel then other athletic places I've been in the past.  I considered Great Western, but did not really have enough interest in the climbing or classes to warrant the extra cost. From GWP webpage, it is $75 a month with a $100 initiation."
oakland,3dwrxm,jetsetter,2,Tue Jul 21 06:08:55 2015 UTC,"I think you mean ""Active sports clubs"" rather than ""Action sports"". That's the gym I use, and I agree with your assessment that there's a small area for weightlifting. One thing I would add though is that they have an order of magnitude better amenities in the locker rooms. Including a hot tub and a sauna. Last I was at Team Tufunga, they didn't really have a locker room at all."

Lots of people out on the weekends getting sun by the lake.  Walk distance to downtown Oakland bar scene, BART, Whole Foods, Trader Joes etc.  Get Comcast, it's expensive but everything else is painfully slower so the money saved isn't beneficial.  Get a parking spot if possible, otherwise you'll never know if you'll find a spot in 5 minutes or 30 minutes and eight blocks away.  Who wants to deal with that?  Also if you have guests come over you can try and park on the street to free up a spot for them to park.  The bad: Sometimes the homeless by the park get too drunk or have a mental episode but that's a pretty easy situation to avoid.  Just keep your eyes out if you're out really late and don't engage with strangers at night even if they seem friendly at first.  Robberies arn't that common but it's a possibility at night.  Parking is shit. I wouldn't leave a vehicle on Grand because they street sweep all the time in order to accumulate parking tickets.  Also people will see your empty car on Grand and break into it if you've got anything of perceived value.  Careful of the unprotected crosswalks on Grand, sometimes drivers will not see you.  Rent is going up quickly.  When I first moved in apartments were in the $800-1200 range and 6 years later apartments are renting in the $1800-2800 range.  Normally rent control is pegged to inflation and no more than 3% a year increased, but check your lease and Oakland laws to confirm this."

Especially in the uptown direction. Being on Lenox and right between all the Grand street stuff and the lake and uptown is really really amazing.   Welcome to Lenox!"

oakland,3dsgud,BAYMuu,4,Mon Jul 20 23:45:34 2015 UTC,"People could mean slightly different things, but I'd guess in general, ""numbered"" neighborhoods mean the areas around those avenues in east Oakland, only south of 580, but including the cross streets and other streets in the area.  But the 30s are a special case, since many of the avenues are only a few blocks long.  Some people may mean only the area around those short aves, near Fruitvale BART... and not 35th and School St.  I really doubt someone saying the ""30s"" does not include the cross streets, like the section of E 16th, or inbetween aves, like Bridge Ave.  School St could be seen as Dimond neighborhood, or its own: School.

oakland,3dsgud,scottfarrar,3,Sun Jul 19 01:25:42 2015 UTC,35th and school is definitely 30s. Id say up to 580 is when its no longer the 30s and more like diamond/redwood.

oakland,3dk51r,amnorvend,8,Thu Jul 16 22:37:20 2015 UTC,"The sad thing is how bad these fights are for the middle class. Most working couples and young families make too much money to qualify for subsidized housing, even if they were lucky enough to land one through the lottery.   By blocking market-rate housing (read: the housing that most people live in), you're really just hurting the majority of people who are productive members of society, but don't have a couple hundred thousand dollars to put down on a mortgage.   Young tech workers, doctors, lawyers, etc, who are moving to the Bay from all around the country, aren't going to suddenly change their plans because a tower they never heard about isn't getting built. If easy housing options -- like new condos, apartments and townhomes -- aren't available, they'll just rent or buy existing homes.   This causes the prices of the existing housing stock to soar, forcing the majority of people (i.e., the middle class) to fight over the remaining houses and apartments, which are now vastly overvalued and in poor repair.   The groups who actively fight new market-rate housing are hurting the vast majority of people, and causing massive strain on the middle class. They may wear ""social justice"" on their sleeves, but in reality, they're as myopic and self-interested as any of the developers, gentrifying techies or prancing hipsters they so despise."
oakland,3dk51r,georgemichaelbluth1,0,Fri Jul 17 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but lets blame ""techies"", that'll solve our problems, right? Right?? US vs THEM! US vs THEM!

oakland,3dk51r,abritinthebay,7,Tue Jul 21 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"UrbanCore is still going to have the best proposal, so we'll still be getting a market rate tower on the lake, as we should. The fact that the EBE and their activist allies aren't happy with the $8 million toward subsidized housing that UrbanCore was going to pay out makes it clear their goal is to actively keep the ""wrong people"" out of Oakland. They don't care about building the appropriate amount of housing a across income levels so much as they want to keep Oakland a certain way."
oakland,3dk51r,georgemichaelbluth1,5,Fri Jul 17 15:47:06 2015 UTC,I'm glad the City Council decided to do the right thing. The East Bay Express deserves some credit for leakingbreaking the city attorney's memo.   Now hopefully we can get some serious housing built on the site.
oakland,3dk51r,unpickle,13,Thu Jul 16 23:12:36 2015 UTC,"Now hopefully we can get some serious housing built on the site.   What do you think is going to happen? If there were any nonprofit builders with $5M+ sitting around, they could have easily bought some other parcel.  All this process has done is delay getting more housing on the market, and depress the value of any future land sales by the city by establishing that the process is going to be a clusterfuck.   The only people who are going to benefit from this are existing homeowners, who are going to have 300 fewer competing units on the market."
oakland,3dk51r,Ochotona_Princemps,7,Fri Jul 17 06:08:26 2015 UTC,I have no idea if any nonprofit developers will be able to make a serious offer and I don't really care. In my reading of the law the city's deal with Urbancore clearly wouldn't have survived the inevitable court challenge. The delay is unfortunate but much better than having the whole thing go down the shitter after months of expensive litigation.
oakland,3dk51r,unpickle,4,Fri Jul 17 06:34:28 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's fair reasoning. My read of the SLA is that non-profits are only entitled to be given a chance to bid on a parcel if the submit a written request for the opportunity. The leaked memo just addressed the question of whether the parcel fell within the ambit of the SLA, which is a broader question.  Honestly, I get why the city did what they did. I'm just annoyed at the opponents of the project. For the amount of effort and money this is costing Oakland could have just bought a different, cheaper parcel and built affordable housing directly. It's such a dumb controversy."
oakland,3dk51r,Ochotona_Princemps,3,Fri Jul 17 06:54:36 2015 UTC,"Worth bearing in mind: if an affordable housing developer puts in a bid that the council can't agree on, whatever does end up getting built must include 15% affordable housing units on-site. If nobody puts in a bid, it can be 100% market-rate housing.  Thus, someone will almost certainly put in a non-serious bid if only to force the city to build more affordable housing on-site."

oakland,3dk51r,Ochotona_Princemps,3,Fri Jul 17 06:03:14 2015 UTC,"This should blow over because there aren't any nonprofit or BMR developers who can afford to pay market value for the parcel.  For EBE it seems, this is about the struggle to keep Oakland poor and humble. Sorry artists, revolutionaries, and yes, lower income people, with what's going on in SF and around the rest of the bay, the era of the forgotten quiet oakland is over.  Educated, moneyed, motivated folks are buying up SFRs all the way down to 880 and beyond and moving in by the thousands.    It won't be official until the 2020 census but it seems likely we are in the midst of a historical population shift on a par with post-WWII.  All of this to say - build the towers as planned!"
oakland,3dk51r,infiniteslinky,2,Fri Jul 17 07:29:03 2015 UTC,"This is a terrible sentiment. There's no need to gloat about the fact that lower-income people and artists are getting pushed out; shoving the working class out to Antioch is bad for everybody.  We have the space and the technical ability to house everybody who wants to live in Oakland, at a variety of price-points. The problem is entirely political; if only we would flip our regulatory scheme from being one that discourages dense residential construction to encouraging/mandates it, we could build enough home to moderate prices."

oakland,3di8a0,Nighshade586,5,Thu Jul 16 21:23:26 2015 UTC,"They repaved Harrison St. in downtown recently and the pavement was in pretty decent shape before. When I saw them tearing out the pavement I was thinking to myself, ""aren't there hundreds of other streets in Oakland that need this more?"""
oakland,3di8a0,old_gold_mountain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:43 2015 UTC,"As pavement degrades a street gets more and more expensive to fix, so sometimes it is more cost effective to fix more miles of roadway in mediocre condition than fewer miles of roadway in terrible condition. This is called ""preventative maintenance"" and seems counterintuitive but it is actually methodical, and the city's way of trying to slowly dig themselves out of decades of underinvestment in infrastructure without making things worse in the long run.  That being said, individual city council members also have discretionary funds they can apply to things like paving each year, even for streets that aren't part of the paving plan. So if there is a terrible street that you and your neighbors would like to see addressed, then get together and petition your city council person to do something about it. This is how Jackson Street downtown was fixed just this year, for instance, even though it wasn't on the paving plan."

oakland,3di8a0,aplomba,2,Thu Jul 16 16:14:10 2015 UTC,I lived in a poor neighborhood and experienced the lower quality roads and whatnot. Once I reported a faulty street light and to my surprise it was promptly fixed. I then made complaints about the road in various specific places and they too were fixed. This whole time I even had conversations with neighbors about the shitty roads and I asked if they ever reported any of these issues. Not one of them even knew you can report these things.   I lived there for three years and saw a dramatic improvement once residence began reporting things. I think the same is true in east Oakland.
oakland,3di8a0,nikatnight,2,Sat Jul 18 02:41:25 2015 UTC,"As they say, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, but unfortunately some people have more discretionary time to be squeaky than others.  Reports of city issues can be made by email to opwcallcenter@oaklandnet.com, by phone at (510) 615-5566, or via the city's website here: http://gismaps.oaklandnet.com/srwebsite/ServiceType.aspx  However, I prefer to use the free SeeClickFix app, or their website at www.seeclickfix.com/oakland, as the city has an official partnership with them and responds to issues reported there the same way. Even better, though, other people can also see the reports you make on SeeClickFix, as opposed to the city's internal system which is closed off to the public and not as trackable. SeeClickFix also allows images to be uploaded, which helps to Public Works crews locate and resolve issues faster.  I've had lots of luck getting many different issues fixed, and even police enforcement, due to reports on SeeClickFix, and recommend others do the same. The quickest turnaround seems to be on traffic signal and street light issues, but potholes, graffiti, and other reports tend to all get fixed within a couple months."

Some motorcyclists circled potholes and ruts on some of our favorites 'round here; it served to also alert bicyclists, drivers and riders to the menace. Since Oakland wasn't even doing that much.  It's good to document these in case someone gets hurt; helps in the legal claim for compensation for your damages. Especially if you have proof you notified the city (for real, not just by painting on the street, although that's good too). Maybe they should paint dates on too.  And I say ""good luck"" because even Rockridge has some big-ass potholes. Some of these roads haven't even had the dangerous ruts and holes PATCHED, let alone resurfaced.  Maybe if all money wasn't going to settle police violence lawsuits, or even for a commission to study why we don't have a commission to study why we don't have a fix for the potholes...."

oakland,3di8a0,TheGodDamnDevil,3,Thu Jul 16 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"They announced they are fixing roads, people and this author need to read the information the City is publishing. I find it funny people bit he'd the same day the City started fixing roads.  From Nextdoor:  The purpose of this informational memorandum is to provide an update on the 2015 “Pothole Blitz.” To keep the City of Oakland’s vehicular and pedestrian traffic safe, Oakland Public Works will conduct a seven-week Pothole Blitz this year. The Pothole Blitz will start on June 15, 2015 in North Oakland’s Council District 1 and end July 31, 2015 in East Oakland’s District 7. The Streets & Sidewalks Division staff will spend one week in each respective Council District, progressing west to east across the City. The Pothole Blitz and Street Maintenance Staff are supported by the State Gas Tax Fund. The strategy will focus on completing as many of the existing outstanding service requests as possible, and to meet the goal of 2,500 potholes repaired by the end of the Blitz. Pothole repair is one technique to maintain more than 2,300 lane miles of streets throughout Oakland.   In addition, Staff will be completing street patching and crack sealing at selected locations as needed to complete outstanding service requests. This is not a substitute for a complete street rehabilitation but can, in the right circumstances, provide a temporary improvement to the wearing surface until permanent repairs can be made.   The following outlines the proposed schedule for the 2015 pothole blitz:   District/Date   1   June 15, 2015 - June 19, 2015   2   June 22, 2015 - June 26, 2015   3   June 29, 2015 - July 3, 2015   4   July 6, 2015 - July 10, 2015   5   July 13, 2015 - July 17, 2015   6   July 20, 2015 - July 24, 2015   7   July 27, 2015 - July 31, 2015   Note: Repair locations are identified by priority level based on high safety risk and designated Bike Routes.   The Bureau of Infrastructure & Operations appreciates your patience and support. For questions please contact Dale Smith, Interim Operations Manager, at 615-5472.   For general information on the City’s paving program, funding, major rehabilitation projects and pavement management in general, visit our webpage at:   http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/o/EC/s/STS/OAK030328  Please see the chart and depending on what Council District you are in, make sure you call the Public Works Call Center and notify them of any potholes you see that need to be repaired. You can start now reporting potholes. Do not wait until they are in your Council District. The call center number is (510) 615-5566.

East Oakland streets are indeed in bad condition, but no worse than in other parts of the city and in some areas (like around the Havenscourt area) somewhat better.  The map they showed of the 5-year paving plan also doesn't include every street that will get paved, only the ones the city is doing with their own money. Other streets in East Oakland will also be getting attention via other projects, like all of International Blvd via the Oakland-San Leandro Bus Rapid Transit construction.

There are more potholes where people actually live right now around the Colisseum area than you can shake a car at, but none on that nice swath of grass where the millionaires play their games.  I have NO problem whatsoever with subsidies, just not to a business that is essentially only open what, 12 times a year? As an economist quoted in the show noted, it would make more economic sense to take the subsidy money (tax deferments or exemptions, infrastructure, etc) and drop it in small bills from an airplane over the city. Really. Really.  Crap, I hate 'em but probably a mall (of shame?) with Hobby Lobby, WalMart, and Dow Chemical would be more socially and fiscally responsible.

oakland,3dfyc4,fhinewine,3,Wed Jul 15 23:43:07 2015 UTC,True. Very apples and oranges. I'm honestly so partial to Piedmont because there's slightly less going on. Restaurants change less frequently. No BART disruption. Fewer cars. But really cool little gems still.

oakland,3dfyc4,abritinthebay,4,Thu Jul 16 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"Commis is excellent -- especially for Piedmont -- but if you're in Rockridge, pretty much all you're gonna find is $$-$$$+ restaurants.  High Peaks Kitchen is a cheap and awesome Indian place that just moved in on College (and they're a welcome exception to the normally pricy/fancy atmosphere of Rockridge dining -- see A16).    Piedmont, however has more of a mix of prices, cuisines, and restaurants.  There's a lot of takeout-type food (Mexican, Thai, French, American, deli food at the grocery store, everything nearby in the Broadway corridor, etc.) and only a few higher-end restaurants, like the new addition of Kronnerburger.  I just think of Rockridge as holding almost exclusively higher-end places whereas Piedmont is more of a mix.  Who knows though, they seem to be slowly converging anyway."

In RR we joke that we can go for a birthday dinner at a certain building and every year it's different, cuz it's a different restaurant in the same place. Commis owner was part of Box & Bells on College that I don't think made a year. A16 has been a million different restaurants, but they seem pretty full.  But the places in RR that consistently have the most patronage (don't know if that means making money) are like Zachary's, Crepevine, Oliveto's Cafe, Wood Tavern/Southie, followed by more bar-like places.

Rockridge has no walkable parks and that's just lame.   I also like Piedmont Ave's central location. I can be in the Grand/Lakeshore area in 15 minutes walking, the cool spots on 40th/Broadway in 10. Rockridge ends up kinda' feeling like an extension of Berkeley, whereas Piemont Ave feels integral to Oakland.   I will say Piedmont Ave used to feel a bit stale, but with the addition of Adesso/Dopo, Homestead, Kronnerburger, Timeless Coffee, Neighbor shop w/ its fermentation popup in the back, its feeling lively and innovative.    Anyway, I think the Grand/Lakeshore retail district is going to pass both in vitality, if it hasn't already. It'll never quite be as ""nice"" as them because of the proximity to the freeway and the fast food restaurants at the end, but the number of shops, restaurants, bars, etc. is killer."

Some food oriented shopping like TJs, Safeway and Market Hall. But spendy for the most part. Too many coffee places (about 5 in a rock's throw from College/Claremont).  Piedmont Ave is a bit more diverse, largely due to proximity to other areas though. More non-artisan bars. Some big employers, but mainly just Kaiser. Much better cemetary. No BART. More diverse businesses.  But neither is as nice as some other parts of Oakland, like down by the Lake or even Uptown these days."

In another comment, you actually identified artists as gentrifiers.  If that's the case, this group, who arrived in the early 2000s, was part of that process.  From my perspective, ""yuppie"" would be a much better fit in that sentence."

We've actually got some good writing about Oakland here -- and though there's a Temescal-specific section, it makes an effort to name-drop some more uncommon destinations.  Highlight: ""Oakland is no San Francisco side trip; it’s the destination.""  Lowlight: THE MAI TAI IS THE OFFICIAL COCKTAIL OF OAKLAND, COME ON.

oakland,3dces0,solarslanger,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:15 2015 UTC,Legit curious. It does seem to me like the Greyhound is the unofficial cocktail. Is there a specific spot where they serve famous mai tais? Kona Club?
oakland,3dces0,eugenesbluegenes,2,Wed Jul 15 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"The drink was invented at Trader Vic's, which was originally in North Oakland."
oakland,3dces0,solarslanger,3,Wed Jul 15 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this.  Before they moved it to that strip in Emeryville, Trader Vic's was on San Pablo in Oakland.  The tiki movement swept America during that time but the epicenter of it was Oakland.    Trader Vic's still has excellent drinks but is a little ~fancier~ than you might like for a tiki bar and isn't that easy to get to on public transit anymore.    Conga Lounge was IMO the best, far and away, but they just shut down -- their sister bar, Forbidden Island, is in Alameda still.  A bit further but legit nonetheless.    Kona Club is good and has a great drink selection too but they don't feel quite as ""tiki"" to me.  I live right next door to them and enjoy it, but still miss Conga. Then there's newer places: like Longitude in Uptown.  Meh.  *edit: Also, I should clarify -- much love to the Greyhound.  It's a fine drink.  But why mention the unofficial cocktail without bringing up the insanely delicious and very Oakland-esque official one? ;)"

If you fall in love with that go to Menlo park and try their (edit their as in ""back a yard"") Caribbean styled jerk.  If you do the food trucks (which you totally should) try chairmen bao!  I've been to a decent amount of trucks but their's is still my fav. Steamed is way better than baked, try the pork belly forsure.  Hawker Fare in oakland is delicious as well.  I've been to Burma Superstar at least a dozen times and have never been disappointed. Try to go for a late lunch because the wait can be ridiculous (they have 3 locations, one in oakland).

oakland,3dbp2o,i_only_eat_food,2,Wed Jul 15 06:22:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the first time I ate at Haven (the first year they opened), it was a complete bust.  All the food tasted like they ran together and I went away very unimpressed.  I went back during Oaklands Restaurant Week 2014 and the fixed menu fare for the event so impressed me I wrote it down.  Oven Roasted Mushrooms, Anson Mills grits, farm eggs, nettles  I had some of the best grits I've ever had, got me into grits.   I've since gone back twice and both times were a very nice experience.  This is a place that does what it does very well, is a great place to impress business associates in Oakland as well as a date night.  Maybe the term ""fine dining"" doesn't mean the same thing to you as it does to me.  To me it means that above all, they have good food that they do the way that only they do and it'll impress people.  Not somewhere I eat (or can afford to eat!) all the time.  So yes.  Fine dining."

I like Taqueria Los Comales for burritos and good mole, Mariscos la Costa for ceviche and seafood, Jalisco for carnitas, and Cholita Linda for your ""new"" Mexican food that still tastes authentic. There's a few burrito spots around town where you can make your own, my favorites are Gerardo's and Ole Ole.

I disagree with half the stuff people have posted, but that's ok because people are different.   Actually my only point of contention is that I believe there is only mediocre barbecue in the bay area.  Or I haven't encountered anything good yet.  Seriously.  You can taste it, too much sauce or too greasy (i know it's barbecue but that doesn't mean you have to feel like you just ate kfc) and complete and total lack of technique in the slow cook.  Lightly smoky and chewy on the inside, burnt to a crisp on the outside.    People get into fist fights in the south about barbecue.  Dry rub or wet, secret ingredients (cumin?  Paprika?  Fish sauce? FISH SAUCE?! I'MMA KEEL YOU) worth jail time over, recipes handed down orally through generations.    There a joke about how to find the best barbecue, find the oldest black guy around.  If that doesn't work, find the oldest white guy but only if you can't understand what he's saying.    I don't in any way mean to put down other people's opinions, but my suggestion to you is to go into Chinatown, old Oakland, 7th and international, there are some gems hidden in west Oakland, stay away from berkeley which is just cheap mediocre college kid food (""gourmet ghetto"", are you kidding me?) Or  elderly white people food (most of San Pablo ave.). And yes b-side barbecue sucked and I'm happy they're closed.  It puts a smile on my face that that barbecue blasphemy is gone.  What are they a bakery or something now?  I digress.  I've had a bit to drink.  My point is take a good long hard look at how much of the hooplah in Oakland is about the food or is it about the show.  There are a lot of places that are about the food.

If you want true BBQ there's only one place in the US to go, and frankly it's South Carolina. And if you want true BBQ sauce there's only one, and it only has two ingredients: vinegar and red pepper. The flame's got to have real hickory too, though.  Best Oaktown Chinatown food I've had is Shandong on 10th, but it's far from the only good food in Chinatown. As for other options have you tried Nelly's? It's been awhile but I'm remembering it as some of the best fried chicken I ever had."

oakland,3dbp2o,matthewn,3,Wed Jul 15 04:28:39 2015 UTC,"San Diego burritos are smaller than the classic ""Mission"" style burrito you get in the Bay. They usually cost a buck or two less. They never contain rice, and usually not beans, either. The tortillas are grilled, not steamed. They are wrapped in paper, never aluminium foil. And the innards are simpler. If you order a carne asada burrito at Roberto's (the king of San Diego taco shop chains) for instance, what you are getting is: a tortilla filled with guacamole, pico de gallo, really good carne asada, and that's it. Pour some of the house red sauce in there if you like. Heaven."

A couple years ago the Raiders took control of ticket sales and since then have had consistent sell outs and a rise in revenue, all with bad seasons."
oakland,3dag49,xolotl92,2,Wed Jul 15 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"From 2013: http://deadspin.com/5982547/raiders-will-reduce-seating-capacity-to-the-nfls-smallest-in-attempt-to-avoid-tv-blackouts   Oakland came in dead last in attendance this season, an average of 54,217 per game. That's just 86 percent of the capacity at O.co Coliseum, already one of the smallest stadiums in the NFL at 63,132. Not small enough. Nearly every game, the Raiders ran up against the NFL's blackout rules, which dictate that 85 percent of seats must be sold on the Thursday before game day. They were blacked out just once in 2012, but it was close.   63,132 capacity with Mt. Davis.   The Coliseum's new capacity will be 53,250, by far the smallest in the NFL. (Chicago's Soldier Field is second, at 61,500.) Season ticket prices are also being lowered across the board.   Then 53,250.  In 2014 they must have opened something new because they average 57,000 for a season total of 459,333. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Football_League_attendance_figures  But its interesting how much Oakland in the past has clamored to attract the Raiders back or keep them here.    1995       The OACC also agreed to spend $85 million to gussy up the coliseum, which is 29 years old and showing its age. The number of luxury boxes -- of which there were zero at the L.A. Coliseum -- will go from 53 to 175.  http://www.si.com/vault/1995/07/03/204434/just-move-baby-al-davis-left-la-to-return-his-raiders-to-oakland-and-he-hopes-to-glory   That number eventually became $225 million.  But also in 1990 Davis had courted Oakland:   Then the following spring Davis announced with great fanfare that he was bound for Oakland, whose lavish $602 million proposal to the Raiders was predicated on projections of a decade of sellouts. If the crowds didn't materialize, taxpayers would have gotten stuck with the tab. When these terms became public and a voter referendum was threatened, the deal was torpedoed. It was then resurrected, only to again be deep-sixed -- literally -- by Oakland Coliseum engineering problems: In order to squeeze 13,500 more seats into the 54,616-seat stadium, Davis had requested that the field be lowered. When workers started digging, they hit water.   And of course they left Oakland in the early 80s because he couldn't get luxury boxes at the Coliseum.  Davis and the Raiders seemed to just be ready to ditch if he doesn't get his demands met.  The Raiders time in the LA Coliseum were also filled with talks over new stadia or renovations.  The Raiders have been extremely demanding over the course of decades.  We're still paying off our last gift to them.  When will we learn?"

oakland,3da73j,Commentariot,6,Tue Jul 14 21:57:28 2015 UTC,Whole Foods can be great or they can be awful- it is really down to the management team at a given store. The problem is that a few bad managers can chew through a fuckload of good people before they move on and those people have no recourse.   WFM has never been great about this and it has only gotten worse as they have grown. They pay less now (adjusted for inflation) than they did in the 90s and the benefits are worse. A lot of great people  both on the floor and in management but the staff could really use a union.
oakland,3da73j,bigsrg,0,Tue Jul 14 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"I guess these folks want Whole Foods to take responsibility for the complete chain of production for their store builds?  For example, similar to how Apple has taken responsibility for labor practices at its contractors / subcontractors."

oakland,3d98rx,oaklandisfun,4,Tue Jul 14 14:22:29 2015 UTC,"Obvious environmental concerns aside, is now really the time to make a massive investment in outdated energy technology? Old-school dirty fossil fuels are on their way out, albeit gradually, as clean energy technologies continue to explode.   This facility could end up being a colossal waste of money when the coal market stagnates and/or dies in 10, 20, 30 years."
oakland,3d98rx,Maximillien,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing since it says Utah mines, this would be a facility to box it up and ship it out. So if the US stopped fossil fuels entirely, it's going to be a growth industry for shipping the stuff off to China."

Anyone who doesnt at least put up a real (not staged) fight against this should have their head examined.  The Sierra Club endorsement is critical for many local Oakland races.  Ive always thought their influence is drastically disproportionate (given that a) real green issues are really rarely dealt with at the urban local level and b) North County SC is woefully ignorant of what Oakland actually needs) but this is a case of put up or shut up for them.  They really need to use their influence here, and not endorse anyone who doesnt put up a fight"
oakland,3d98rx,JasonH94612,-2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"K this coal train business is gettin a bit out of hand. Coal is not going to be burned in Oakland, it is to be shipped through only.   Unburned coal has one, and only one, environmental hazard: fine coal dust.  Coal gets shipped in open rail cars. By the time it arrives from UTAH, essentially all of the wind-carryable fine dust will have long since blown out of the top 3 to 6 inches of coal.  IF, as I read elsewhere, they are going to have fully-enclosed transfer facilities (i.e. enclosed, well sealed buildings,) dust generated when the coal cars are unloaded is not going to impact Oakland air quality.  When it is conveyored into the holds of ships, those holds are also largely enclosed spaces with fairly small access /loading openings, over which dust shrouds will likely be used.  So relax, people, this isn't high level radioactive waste, or even liquid oil.    In the larger picture, sure yeah yeah coal is bad for air quality in China and for global warming, but for chrissakes sit back a bit and enjoy the ride we are all on to the Apocalypse. Complaining about it is only going to accelerate its arrival. Have faith in God and at least your soul, if not your body, will probably be OK."

You do not need a reservation but the wait for a spot may extend to 7 or 8am. If you wanted a reserved space, just go to the swap on Sunday and ask an employee how to go about reserving a space. Last time I sold, I think the stand-by rate was $35 a spot and a reserved rate was $30 a spot but don't quote me on that."

oakland,3ct3fe,limnusJosh,6,Fri Jul 10 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"Any system where we don't lock hundreds of thousands into tiny cells where they are systematically demeaned and brutalized.  Just the way people are housed causes and exacerbates the mental health problems of the incarcerated. Prison is not a safe place for the imprisoned (or those who work within them).  If concern for the prisoners isn't convincing, you should be concerned for those who have to work in those jobs.  They're almost entirely working class positions that put individuals in dangerous and traumatic situations on a regular basis.  Correctional officers are considerably more likely to kill themselves, and suffer from PTSD.  Studies show that PTSD rates among COs are about the same as combat veterans - about 1/3rd of COs suffer from PTSD.  Our correctional system simply doesn't work.  All it does is displace crime (as oppose to stop crime).  This ends up damaging innocent correctional staff, nonviolent drug offenders, and individuals who have committed crimes that garner less sympathy, but are still human beings who should be treated with an acceptable amount of dignity and respect.  Dealing with the prison industrial complex in the U.S. is a huge issue.  There is no way I can formulate a complete alternative within the time and space allowed here.  Fixing our system has to be done on both the input level (how people end up in custody and in prison) and also on the level of how prisons themselves are constituted, regulated, staffed, etc.  The Scandinavian countries do a pretty good job of treating their prisoners humanely and there are lessons to be learned there, although the systems are not perfect."

oakland,3cqdlv,LtCthulhu,4,Thu Jul 9 23:02:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think the back-in angled parking is a good idea.

Everyone follows too closely in this city which is significantly dangerous with people throwing their car in reverse on a busy street.   I don't think this argument really holds water. Since there is a bike lane between the auto lane and the parking, a driver would signal, merge into the bike lane, then back into the space. The cars behind go around.  With the current condition it's even worse, with cars backing into active traffic.  The fact that drivers would be pulling forward into traffic, instead of backing into traffic makes a huge difference in safety for drivers and cyclists alike.    I think the protected bike lane config is clearly the best call. Narrow or wide, doesn't matter.   I disagree about the ""narrow or wide, doesn't matter"" as well. If the bike lane is so narrow that a big chunk is on the gutter, with occasional storm drains, gutter debris, and occasional cars that have pulled too far in, overhanging the bike lane, that space for travel shrinks considerably. Add in the conflicts at intersections, where a driver trying to turn right has to check for cyclists on the other side of a line of cars, where they are not used to looking, as well as people (especially children) attempting to get from their car to the sidewalk (and vice versa) in a busy commercial area, I wouldn't be nearly as comfortable as on a traditional bike lane with back-angled parking.   Parking protected bicycle lanes sound like a no brainer until you really start to think about the logistics. At which point, traditional bike lanes with back-angled parking appears to offer the most safety benefits in this situation."
oakland,3cqdlv,eugenesbluegenes,3,Thu Jul 9 23:54:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that back-in parking is probably better than the current set up. But I don't think it's better than the protected bike lane. I think the cars attempting to go around someone backing into an angled spot is a bad thing. The nose of the car backing up will swing left.  I also don't trust the general population to be able to successfully back into a parking space. ALthough it might be slightly easier than parallel parking which most people around here can do...I'll think about this.  The issue with backing into traffic can be solved by just increasing the angle of the parking space, or having a buffer zone so you can ""poke out"" while not actually being in the lane yet as you back out.  Also note that during the meeting their definition of a ""narrow"" bike lane was between 5 - 8 ft. That's wider than most bike lanes currently in place around the city. I'd love to see what their definition of a ""wide"" bike lane is!  I agree with the pedestrian thing crossing the bike lane, but it's so easy to just look. You'll be looking over the hood of your car. No blocked line-of-sight. There's also going to be wheel stops to prevent cars from going over into the bike lane, and a buffer zone to give some space.  As for turning right, you just look to the right like you always should for pedestrians and bikes. There may also be a mixing zone where the bike lane and the right turn lane merge for a handful of yards."
oakland,3cqdlv,LtCthulhu,2,Fri Jul 10 00:09:59 2015 UTC,"5 feet was the maximum noted in the presentation, and that doesn't account for any vehicular overhang (curb stops are great, but some cars overhang rather far past the front wheel). I'd like to see 10 foot lanes, which would add a foot to each side, and switching one side to parallel parking instead of angled to add a few more feet if we're going with parking protected. Then it gets more reasonable as far as width. And as that one dude who had done his own parking space counts pointed out, it would only lose about 4 spaces. With those developments I'd feel better about the parking protected lanes. But I still feel more uncomfortable with the pedestrians crossing the bike lane to get to and from cars than I do on the street side of the parking with a wide bike lane. Especially with back angled parking, not having to worry so much about drivers entering the roadway semi-blindly. I'd feel much more comfortable with this situation with a full 2 foot wide curb between the cars and the cycletrack, to reinforce to those on foot that they are crossing a travel lane (even if just for cycles) to get to the sidewalk.   Really happy to see this whole discussion happening in any case, and encouraged by the general support for safe infrastructure there was last night."
oakland,3cqdlv,eugenesbluegenes,2,Fri Jul 10 00:26:30 2015 UTC,I agree with basically all your criticisms on the protected bike lane. I think parallel parking would be perfect for it. That's what they've got over in cupertino.
oakland,3cqdlv,LtCthulhu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:34:40 2015 UTC,"I heard them say parking protected bike lanes would be 5-8'. And usually the design accounts for overhang, so the wheel stops are placed ~4 feet back from the bike lane. Ideally, they'd raise the bike lane itself, but I don't think Oakland is there yet. 10' lanes would make more sense, good point.  About the parking-counting guy: I heard him say the number 3.75, but my attention had wandered so I didn't hear how he got that number or what it represented.   I can't imagine that by turning all the diagonal spaces on one side to parallel that you'd only lose 4 spots. How can that be? Is that really what he was saying? If that were true, that solution make a ton of sense."
oakland,3cqdlv,eugenesbluegenes,2,Fri Jul 10 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"It's 60 80 feet curb to curb. 10' center turn lane, 2 11' auto lanes, 2 3' buffer between auto and traffic, 2 16' angled parking would leave room for 5' on each side. Maybe you squeeze the parking and pull 6'? The rightmost 2 feet has occasional stormdrains and significant gutter clutter.  Unless there's some sort of curb between the parking and the cycletrack, I really fear pedestrian-bicycle collisions.   But I think even more than my comfort level, we must be concerned with how this would become a showpiece for a radical redesign of our streetscape. My fear is that a half-assed showpiece will not endear the public to the concept. How long will it be until a cyclist collides with a distracted kid, or an old lady new to the redesign walks right in front of a bike? There needs to be some sort of curb between the parking and the cycletrack to reinforce that a traffic lane is being crossed.  Unfortunately the money to do it right isn't budgeted at this time. They have money to restripe and that's all.   With these considerations, I'd rather ride on the street-side with back-in parking.  As far as the parking count, that is what he was saying and he got the numbers by actually counting the spaces. Then I'm sure he calculated how many traditional parallel spots would fit.  I'm not exactly sure how much space diagonal parking saves but I'm not ready to try to do that research now.  I doubt it saves so much space that many more than four spots would be lost. In any case, I feel like parking isn't even very impacted above Mandana anyway."
oakland,3cqdlv,cream-of-cow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"You sure it's not 80'? Your breakdown exceeds 60'.  You make a good point about setting a bad precedent. If they're not willing to do it right here, they shouldn't do it.  But the question is still out there: when money does become available, or if they do this on a another street with angled parking, what is the right solution? Ironically, putting a straight curb of any width between parking and the sidewalk probably makes the bike lane impossible to sweep with standard equipment, exacerbating a different problem. Instead a sawtooth shaped curb could be built, like you see in some parking lots. It seems that if the sidewalk side of this example could be narrowed considerably, pedestrians would still have to step onto the wedges of curb between cars, which would give a clear sense of transition to the bike lane."
oakland,3cqdlv,eugenesbluegenes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"It's true there would be a learning curve with parking-protected bike lanes. Pedestrians crossing the bike lanes would be a challenge, but it's nothing that a little vigilance and a bike bell couldn't solve.   Everyone's different, but I'd gladly take slight delays that might come from pedestrian crossings if I had a protected lane to ride in.  One other point about drivers making right turns. Again, you're right that there'd initially be more danger because there's a change in the road configuration. But with angled parking between the roadway and bikeway, that means there's enough room for a car to pause between the two if there's a bike coming, so there's less need for a driver to rush across to get out of traffic. I think that would help make the transition safer."
oakland,3cqdlv,cream-of-cow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of BIAP, but it seems reversing cars causes enough anxiety public as is.

oakland,3cqdlv,ash2ash,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:08:12 2015 UTC,"I guess what makes backing into traffic less stressful for some is that there's almost always a car waiting for that space that will hold up traffic.

It makes me think there's a large number of people driving on Grand Ave. (especially on Saturdays) who thinks parking is only done at home and gas stations."

oakland,3cqdlv,abritinthebay,2,Sat Jul 11 09:09:49 2015 UTC,"Lots of existing bikeways do get redesigned to help bring them up to more current standards, but usually only when the street is being repaved and the lane lines are being repainted anyway (like what happened on Webster Street through Downtown last month, where a painted buffer was added to the bike lanes). This way we get better facilities with the only cost being staff time to design them.  I believe the portion of Grand Ave that already has bike lanes will indeed get an upgrade to widen and buffer them once that segment is repaved as well, but this won't take away from the ability to implement new bike lanes elsewhere."

They might lift the fiber up onto the poles instead of pulling them underground. I'm not sure which is cheaper long-term. Seems like airborne fiber would be a hassle to maintain with storms/car accidents/etc. and underground fiber could be a bitch after an earthquake.   There's probably a whole nightmare permitting process that is happening now which could take a few years possibly. The bay area is kind of notorious for having really nitpicky environmental/municipal permitting departments.  Edit: looking at their prices they are actually cheaper than cable internet.

oakland,3ckleo,Drapeau_Noir,4,Wed Jul 8 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"Some context to what a school ""lockdown"" is:  Police contact the school letting them know a gun or incident is in the immediate area, or, a weapon or dangerous incident occurs somewhere on the campus itself. Then a principal goes on the PA and says, ""teachers please lock your doors, this is a lockdown.""  (usually its not a secret message because it just sounds silly and everyone knows what you're saying anyway) Teachers then go to their doors and gather any kids from the hall into their classrooms, then shut and lock the door.  Class continues normally.  If the school has a perimeter fence then the gate is also closed by a school security officer. The point of all this is so that students are accounted for and nobody is wandering into a bad situation.  Usually the lockdown is over before a class ends and it only interferes with bathroom passes (which can get serious! haha).  Occasionally it will go longer and the class schedule is disrupted a little."
oakland,3ckleo,scottfarrar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:58:59 2015 UTC,"""Lockdowns"" are not normal things in most American schools, and they should not be minimized.  My kid, and all her friends, know when there is a lockdown at our school (there's at least two a year) and why (fuckin criminals).  Oakland parents and kids should not have to deal with this shit.  And please save ""this is a typical city, what do you expect?"" Because, again, what happens in Oakland is not typical of even other big (or, face it, medium-szixed) cities"
oakland,3ckleo,JasonH94612,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"Ya we had about 2 a year when I taught at Oakland High. It was never a secret to the kids. I agree that its sad that these kind of measures have to be taken; I have no attachment to them, only a goal to keep students (and everyone) safe. Perhaps it is too much to lockdown the school because of a hint of a gun-- I mean, I'm open to alternatives.  Lockdowns are not unique to Oakland, see http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/us/in-age-of-school-shootings-lockdown-drills-are-the-new-duck-and-cover.html?_r=0 Many more schools created lockdown-like procedures after Columbine. I'm not sure if Oakland schools have a higher rate compared to other parts of the U.S."

oakland,3cj1gt,youngoak,7,Wed Jul 8 23:35:08 2015 UTC,"I used to be an occasional seller at the Coliseum Flea Market. Let me preface this by saying that the vast majority of the vendors there are honest, hard-working individuals who obtain inventory from storage auctions, clean-outs, bulk collected goods, and other legal sources. However, there are some vendors that don't care where their inventory comes from. The stolen goods are usually unloaded, early in the morning, from 6am to 8am. Around the outskirts of the flea market, there will be a swarm of activity around a suspiciously non-flea market type of small passenger car. The swarm is made up of unscrupulous flippers and flea market vendors buying the stolen goods directly from the street-level guys and fences.   Unfortunately, I do think your search will be difficult but for your best chances, I would recommend searching the Coliseum Market during the week, Tuesday, Wed, Thurs, or Friday.

oakland,3cg34u,oaklandisfun,5,Tue Jul 7 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"The developer and city's argument that it's not surplus land because it had no prior use seems pretty weak. It clearly had a prior use as part of a public roadway. Also their claim that it belonged to a redevelopment agency not bound by the Surplus Lands Act has no basis because all the redevelopment agencies were dissolved in 2012.   It sounds like all the city had to do to comply with the law, however, was send out offer notices to some affordable housing developers:   . . . the city would violate no law if it were to now offer the property to an affordable housing developer.  “Accordingly, there is nothing that would legally preclude the City from complying with the Surplus Land Act now by sending out the required offer notices [to affordable housing developers],” wrote Parker.   I wonder why they didn't do that?   The article is unclear on whether that meant the city had to automatically accept the first offer that came in from an affordable housing developer. I mean, what if all the affordable housing developers wanted to build were a few low-rise houses when the city wants a high rise? Would the city have been stuck with a smaller deal even though it wasn't the amount of housing they hoped for?"
oakland,3cg34u,unpickle,3,Tue Jul 7 18:34:37 2015 UTC,"They're not bound to accept offers from affordable housing developers. Only to solicit them.  EDIT: Otherwise, one could say ""I have a nickel! Land please!"". Obviously, uh, that's undesirable."
oakland,3cg34u,Kalium,6,Thu Jul 9 02:12:34 2015 UTC,"I can see the argument that the City Council broke the law. What bothers me is that this is probably a much better deal than what the city would have gotten from an affordable housing developer. The city could really use the extra $5.1 million to hire more police officers, fix our crumbling infrastructure, remove blight, fix potholes and I'm sure we could go on. Not to mention, $8 million for affordable housing is nothing to sneeze at. It will probably buy more affordable housing than the developer could build on-site.  I get that the city needs more affordable housing, but fighting this deal just seems penny-wise and pound-foolish."
oakland,3cg34u,amnorvend,7,Tue Jul 7 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"What bothers me is that this is probably a much better deal than what the city would have gotten from an affordable housing developer   That's the thing. The law says the city must solicit offers from the affordable housing developers, but it doesn't necessarily have to accept them:   After [the city] has received notice from the entity desiring to purchase or lease the land, [the city] and the entity shall enter into good faith negotiations to determine a mutually satisfactory sales price or lease terms.  If the price or terms cannot be agreed upon after a good faith negotiation period of not less than 60 days, the land may be disposed of without further regard to this article.   It seems that's all the city needed to do. If no affordable housing developers were able to give the city what the land is actually worth after at least 60 days of negotiation then they'd be free to move forward with the sale to UrbanCore. Now it's probably so late in the game that it'd probably be pretty hard for them to argue they're making a ""good faith"" negotiation when the sale to UrbanCore is practically a fait accompli."

It's cheaper long-term (and definitely less of a pain in the ass) to train some climbing vines up a wall than it is to paint and repaint over tags. Plus, it makes the streets greener."
oakland,3ccko3,redrightreturning,8,Tue Jul 7 00:56:18 2015 UTC,I know I'm in the minority but I think a lot of the graffiti is beautiful. When I'm on BART one of my favorite things is to look out of the window between Coliseum station and West Oakland and see all of the art on buildings.

oakland,3c7g1s,Fat_Taiko,25,Sun Jul 5 20:42:54 2015 UTC,"On sunny days, you can catch thousands of people walking, dancing in drum circles, biking, picnicking and enjoying themselves around Oakland’s Lake Merritt. On weekends, this is especially true near Lakeshore Avenue between El Embarcadero and East 18th Street.  In the past few weeks, however, the Oakland Police Department has moved electric traffic signs to the eastern side of Lake Merritt that warn that barbecuing or carrying open containers of alcohol would result in citations.  Some residents who live near Cleveland Heights, the neighborhood south of Interstate 580 and east of the lake, and those on Lakeshore Avenue itself, resent the large crowds and have complained to the city. Mounds of trash and loud music figure in some of the complaints, but dumping coals by the lake shore has become a particularly hot point of contention.  Other residents say the recent crackdown may be racially motivated.  “Up until the recent remodeling in 2013, (the lake) wasn’t a hangout spot,” said Leon Sykes. “We paid millions for the lake to look like it does now. There’s a history of unfairly policing public spaces where people of color are while leaving other white social spaces alone. Why did we pay that if they don’t want us there?”  For the first time in a long time, Oakland has a meeting place that’s open and attractive to everyone. You would think that the city would showcase the diversity of race, class and social activities that bring people together by the lake as a testament to its changing image. But no. The complaints of a few about trash, barbecuing and music are hindering that message of unity. Oakland needs to celebrate the growing number of people frequenting Lake Merritt instead of seeking to discourage or even punish them with bureaucratic dictates.  First, what’s really happening? Oakland City Councilman Abel Guillen, who represents the Lake Merritt district, suggests park users don’t know the rules. He said park ambassadors are not planning to issue citations for grilling until they decide how to move forward with the recommendations from the Oakland Parks and Recreation staff. Already, Guillen said, complaints have dropped since park rangers have begun educating people about the lake rules.  Last month, the city added $800,000 to the budget to maintain Lake Merritt for the next two years. “We’re already looking into adding additional trash cans,” said Guillen.“We want people to use the parks but be respectful.”  Oakland Parks and Recreation staff members have been working with a newly created task force to tour the lake and come up with recommendations, according to Dana Riley, manager of operations. “We’re looking for solutions right now,” said Riley, noting that adding permanent barbecue pits that use propane may be a viable option. Also: “What we’ve learned is some of the issues have been double-parking when people are unloading grills and coolers.”  The parks department did cite a few individuals at the lake in May for alcohol and public urination. Also of concern: Oakland Parks and Recreation requires a permit for groups of 25 people who are playing music, and multiple permits for bigger events.  What’s going to help keep Lake Merritt the spot where all are welcome? The city seems as if it’s working on the barbecue pits.  Trash? Pick up after yourselves and that solves the problem.  But I see where issues can arise with needing a permit for groups playing music. In many instances, meetings are serendipitous. What starts as a few friends meeting up quickly becomes a larger gathering as people recognize each other and decide to hang out. There’s nothing wrong with that, and it shouldn’t warrant any type of punishment. Friendly gatherings among a few people playing conga drums shouldn’t be dealt with the same way as a full-fledged concert.  The diversity at Lake Merritt is a sight to behold. Let’s keep it safe and open to everyone.  Spencer Whitney is a San Francisco Chronicle editorial writer. E-mail: swhitney@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @spencewhitney"

I think the cost to build it was absurd but it works and the main improvement is not having to exit the gates of station in what is arguably the most dangerous neighborhood that BART serves when you're most vulnerable and distracted.

oakland,3bvwtv,firewerx,7,Thu Jul 2 16:12:52 2015 UTC,"Really fascinating article. For those who don't want to read it, here are some interesting excerpts.     ""Roughly two-thirds of the rental units in Oakland have rent control, which means landlords can only increase rents in those units by small amounts each year based on the consumer price index (rent hikes could not exceed 1.9 percent in 2014-15, for example). When owners sell rent-controlled properties, the existing tenants have a right to maintain their same rents and protections under new landlords. But when residents move out, landlords are free to raise rents as much as they want and can thus set a significantly higher base rent with new occupants. As a result, housing advocates said, it can be very lucrative for real estate investors to purchase rent-controlled buildings in Oakland — if they can find a way to remove low-paying tenants and replace them with wealthier ones.""      ""Flynn — who also manages properties through his company, ""Flynn Family Holdings LLC"" — owns more than 3,000 rental units in the Bay Area...he also purchased two other apartment buildings near Lake Merritt through two new companies he established: 1800 Lakeshore Avenue (owned by ""Lakeshore Athol LP"") and 362 Euclid Avenue (""Niko Arms LP"").  In interviews, the 1918 Lakeshore tenants who filed the recent complaint said that soon after Flynn purchased the building, it was clear that the property managers wanted them out...But after Flynn bought the building, (Lucky) Stewart (Property Manager) started to return their checks and eventually accused Phenix of unlawfully subleasing the unit to [his girlfriend], records show. That's despite the fact that they had documentation of [her] paying rent in 2013 to the original landlord. Still, records show that Flynn's property managers repeatedly refused to accept their rent checks.  Then in May 2015, after months of returning their checks, Stewart sent Phenix a ""three-day notice to pay rent or quit"" — a first step toward an eviction — ordering him to move out or pay six months' worth of owed rent, which totaled $9,340.08. He had to pay or leave within three days.""   Crazy stuff"

We have a new born baby and two dogs, one of which is a pitbull/rottweiler mix. I was panicking about what would happen with new owners; they would be able to kick us out if they wanted to move into our unit, and if we had to find a new place...finding a house that allows dogs is hard enough, finding one that accepts pitbulls or rottweilers is ridiculous, much less a mix of them. And with a baby, we don't have much room in our budget to spend more on housing. And then there are stories like this one...just absolutely disgusting behavior...  This is why we attempting to buy the house from our landlords. We needed to borrow from our 401ks as well, in addition to borrowing money from our parents. And we have a FHA loan, which allows us to pay just 3.5% on a down payment, but even with that, we are stretching ourselves. I didn't think we would be buying a house for another 5 years.

oakland,3bvwtv,amnorvend,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"The big problem here is that it's going to be incredibly difficult to build more affordable housing if developers can't kick people out of their homes. I think there should be a provision that allows for a more formalized eviction process to redevelop a building for affordable housing. That way developers don't have to resort to these kinds of underhand tactics.  Granted, blight also plays a big role. If it were easier to redevelop blighted properties, I'd imagine we'd see less of this kind of thing."
oakland,3bvwtv,sweetrobna,2,Fri Jul 3 17:12:47 2015 UTC,New developments are not affected by rent control laws. The reason new housing is being built or redeveloped is because of the affordable housing and other onerous requirements.

To my mind, in an urban environment like Oakland, having open space contributes value to the city beyond just the monetary worth of the land itself. In fact studies have shown that open space provides a psychological benefit to area residents. Plus land in Oakland is probably undervalued to begin with.   Yes there's a tech fueled housing crunch going on right now, but it seems pretty clear if you take off the technophile blinders that when the tech bubble pops, housing demand will rapidly drop. Should Oakland be staking its future on a short term single-industry bubble?

This is not cheap.   if you take off the technophile blinders that when the tech bubble pops, housing demand will rapidly drop.   This did not happen in the last tech bubble and there is no reason to believe it will happen now. Housing prices then fell 10-15% after growing 30-40%, and then quickly rebounded back to where they started before the burst.   Should Oakland be staking its future on a short term single-industry bubble?   No, but this isn't doing that. This is meeting housing demand that is far, far in excess of supply with or without the tech industry as a factor. See here for a source:   http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.pdf  Note that this is for all of Coastal California, not just areas where tech is booming.

This is not a ""give away"" there are hard benefits for the city.  In addition, more residential in downtown means more people walking around which is proven to reduce crime.

Their moves over the last 20 years are a template for how to make sports work for the city rather than allowing them to wring the city dry.  Warning: I'm speaking dispassionately here. I'm not a fan of either team, so I'm talking about what makes sense for Oakland as a city and not what would be good for fans:  Let the Raiders go wherever. Communities just don't get any reasonable return from big expensive football stadiums because they just can't fill 'em up enough times per year -- the only way a city should want one is if it's primarily privately funded.  Build a new ballpark for the A's, but put it someplace where people will want to hang out before/after the game. The smartest thing they did with AT&T was put it away from BART -- now, 81 times per year at minimum, San Francisco gets 41,000 people passing through an area thick with restaurants, bars and stores.   Myself, I think JLS would be perfect -- you're less than a mile from the 12th Street BART station, it's in an area that already has some decent activity but which could support a lot more, a park there would be automatically scenic thanks to the Bay...

The idea being that where there is value on one side of the equation there should be equal value on the opposite.  We stress giving good information and objective advice and won't hesitate in directing people to outside resources for their needs if that is where their solution resides.  It took some time but in the end good long time relationships evolved out of this approach that sustain us to this day.  It is still not a lucrative business but it is at least paying its own bills.

If you want to save the hassle, find a community that's professionally managed, such as Bridgecourt (Emeryville) or something else.

If the bridge is 150 feet long by 12 wide (at a guess) and people are packed at a density of 4 square feet per person and they average 160 lbs each, lets see, that works out to... about 72,000 pounds, or 36 tons, around the weight of one fully loaded semi truck + trailer. That sounds about right. I bet its engineered for at least double that amt. But I also bet the downward deflection at the center of the bridge was measurable, if not visible to the naked eye. Maybe an inch or two?  Followup: standard limit of vertical deflection for foot bridges is 1/500th the span length.  1/500th of 150 feet is about 3.5 inches, roughly."

The striped polo guy couple looks white, but the couple to their right looks Asian. The long shorts on the guy is a dead give-away.

oakland,3b5vrj,mrana,-1,Fri Jun 26 05:46:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, could you see the way those cops said ""stop resisting"" as if the guy wasn't 100% compliant with what they asked???"
oakland,3b5vrj,Kovnerbielski,7,Fri Jun 26 05:58:45 2015 UTC,"From the Bart safety manual:  Smoking, eating, drinking or using music/video players without headphones is prohibited in stations and on trains. Violations can lead to citations and fines.  Not seeing anything about getting slammed to the ground and arrested.  He wasn't resisting nor could he with a knee in his back and face in the floor."
oakland,3b5vrj,mrana,-2,Fri Jun 26 06:09:25 2015 UTC,"You wrote that as if the event exists in a vacuum.  A lot of things can escalate a citation to an arrest.  Maybe he had priors or was wasted, probably not though since the type of person that would smoke on the BART platform I'd such a great contributor to society.  And yes, you can still resist when you are on the ground with a knee in your back.  You can push back with your hands, arms, legs, whatever. Don't act like you don't understand.  If you don't want to get slammed to the ground, don't resist.  It's not complicated."
oakland,3b5vrj,Pinatubo,9,Fri Jun 26 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"I watched it from pretty much the start.  The Bart police asked him his name, he told them, and they kept telling him he was lying.  When they wouldn't let him leave but didn't have anything to arrest him on he tried to leave and then this happened. Not a vacuum, but very much an overreaction by Bart police. He was only resisting by not letting them detain him when they didn't have cause and trying to leave. He have his name and number of his father to a bystander to call and it was the same name he was giving."
oakland,3b5vrj,aplomba,4,Fri Jun 26 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not making a judgment on the validity of arrest for the underlying crime.  However, just so everybody knows, a wrongful arrest by an officer doesn't not provide you the right to physically resist that arrest. For better or worse it's been established that your recourse is through civil litigation (again not making a judgment on the effectiveness of that either).  Whatever you do, do not resist detainment or arrest.  Now, back to studying for the Bar..."
oakland,3b5vrj,Pinatubo,-3,Sun Jun 28 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"Look we don't know if they were justified in detaining him.  What is certain is that if you are being detained you don't have the right to just walk away because you think their reason is bullshit.  If that happens and you keep it up, they are allowed to put you on the ground like that.  At that point you are resisting arrest."

It's like the Giants: the fans are everywhere in the Bay Area.  I love how Oakland is now supposed to ""get"" the Warriors because it had an orderly victory parade.  To paraphrase Chris Rock: ""You're supposed to have an orderly victory parade!""  I work in SF and people there have absolutely NO problem claiming the Warriors.  I dont understand why Oaklanders are so insecure about going the other way"
oakland,3b2xfv,JasonH94612,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:14:41 2015 UTC,You do realize when fans buy tickets either if they're season ticket holders (which there's plenty) or if you buy from ticketmaster or stubhub they usually have to provide a billing address. I'm fine with them moving to SF so owners can fatten their bank accounts. Oakland had the Warriors for many years and we have a championship and hopefully a couple more before they leave.
oakland,3b2xfv,daveychoi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"I certainly realize that season ticket holders (or other buyers) provide billing addresses when they charge their tickets.  What I am not sure about--and you can verify--is whether the Warriors, EBX or anyone else actually has this data and analyzes it  This here map gives me the impression that Oaklanders are no more rabid about the Warriors than other Bay Area communities"
oakland,3b2xfv,JasonH94612,2,Fri Jun 26 20:59:20 2015 UTC,My argument wasn't that Oakland fans are more rabid then SF fans. I was just counter arguing that this ticket buyer information is there and probably available if someone digs deep enough so perhaps EBX did do enough digging to get this data. As an Oakland Warriors fan I don't mind them moving back to SF since that's where they're originally from but I do hope they don't change their name back to the San Francisco Warriors which is a separate argument. Lacob and Guber would be disrespecting and alienating their East Bay fan base if they did that.

oakland,3b06r6,old_gold_mountain,7,Wed Jun 24 22:28:37 2015 UTC,I love how there's a dedicated bike storage location on Broadway & 19th for BART but no dedicated bike lane to support it.
oakland,3b06r6,UnReal31337,7,Thu Jun 25 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"4 lane Grand is pretty crazy.  Near the Safeway people are zooming around avoiding the left-turning cars.  But near the theater, people are zooming around avoiding the people trying to park.  How do they plan to mix the bike lanes with the heavily used parking?  In those angled, sloped spots I think it'd be very hard to see a cyclist coming up.  They could put the bike lane between parking and the sidewalk I suppose."
oakland,3b06r6,scottfarrar,5,Thu Jun 25 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"Separated bike lanes is definitely the way to go. It may take a while for that to catch on, as it is typically more expensive to add a bike lane outside of the parking areas, but for bike and car safety, it's so much better than the alternatives. I really hope we can build enough civic interest to do the right thing for the future of our wonderful city."

oakland,3b06r6,BrazilianPotato,2,Thu Jun 25 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"As much as I would ADORE more trains/cars, BART's congestion issues are partly technical ones that probably can't be addressed without a second transbay tube  (the current bottleneck that limits train frequency) or fully-automated trains (which was opposed when initially proposed by operators for obvious as well as legitimate technical reasons but would allow the trains to proceed more closely together at higher speed)."
oakland,3b06r6,dungeonsandderp,3,Thu Jun 25 06:28:41 2015 UTC,"It would help if they skipped 8 car trains during morning rush hour, me and the 10 bikers left at station agree"

First of all, people rarely know how to complain or have the energy to and secondly, let's accept that there's a political trade off going on. It is illogical to think that car throughput won't decline a bit or that some drivers won't be annoyed. Heck bicyclists may be annoyed, too.  As a driver, I find road diets make driving less stressful and I certainly would prefer to have a nice place to go to. There's tons of potential in this city for making or roads more pleasant for all modes of travel but we could do a better job pricing parking so that there is a place to park when you arrive."

oakland,3az8za,inkjet_dipset,19,Wed Jun 24 18:15:21 2015 UTC,"You'll be in a very nice area but you should be attentive in the ""flats"" - the area closier to the Bay from where you're staying. If you head down there make sure you're confident in your ability to navigate a dangerous area. The area around the stadium is probably the most troubled in Oakland in terms of crime, particularly along International and Foothill. The stadium itself is totally fine though.  You should Lyft down to the stadium from the neighborhood you're in - you're in a bit of a suburban transit desert in Lincoln Highlands, there's no BART service and taking AC Transit would require a transfer.  But! You're right next to Joaquin Miller Park. You should go hiking there - you'll probably be walking distance where you're staying. Beautiful park with great hiking and views of the bay.  After the game, take the Richmond BART line up to 19th St/Uptown station and hit the bars, if you're looking for nightlife. It's one of the most vibrant districts in the area in terms of bars and restaurants - particularly the stretch along Broadway and Telegraph.  During the day, hang out by the lake. Grab some tacos from Tacos Mi Rancho (taco truck) and eat them on the grass at the lake.  Oakland is a restaurant city so there are literally thousands of places that people might recommend...what kind of food are you looking to get?  Check local concert venues to see if there's anyone you like playing. The Fox, the New Parish, Leo's are all great and there are dozens and dozens of smaller venues supporting our blossoming music scene.  The ballpark is pretty unremarkable. A lot of us A's fans like it for that - because its only attraction is baseball, the only people who go are people who are there to see baseball.  Also, San Francisco and Oakland are so close together they'd basically be considered a single city if there wasn't a body of water between them. Don't be afraid of criss-crossing the bay...you don't necessarily need to confine yourself to Oakland for three days and then to San Francisco for the week following. If you're around next Friday as well you should absolutely check out First Friday in Uptown in Oakland, even if you're staying in SF then."

If you want hiking Redwood Regional or Tilden is a close uber ride away."
oakland,3az8za,daveychoi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:34:59 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for all the info!  We're from Kansas City so high-crime areas is something we're fairly used to. I'll stay on high-alert when we're in the area though. Looking at International on Google Street View, its actually pretty reminescent of our most troubled street, Troost Avenue.   Hiking is high on the agenda, and I'd seen Joaquin Miller Park on the map so I'll definitely have to check that out!  We love taco trucks so we'll definitely check that out. Which lake were you referring to though?  Also, I'm not sure how well this will be received, but in a city as liberal and progressive as Oakland, how difficult is it to find cannabis? I'm not bringing mine with me to Oakland but wouldn't be upset if I found some while visiting."
oakland,3az8za,old_gold_mountain,8,Wed Jun 24 19:00:25 2015 UTC,"Which lake were you referring to though?   Lake Merritt, downtown. Tacos Mi Rancho is at the end of International right at the lake. Tacos Sinaloa is preferred by a lot of people but it isn't in as interesting of an area for a tourist.   how difficult is it to find cannabis?   If you have friends in the area just ask them. Everyone knows someone. Oakland is colloquially known as ""Oaksterdam"" in the stoner culture here and is basically the Bay Area's capital for weed smoking.  However, if you don't have friends in the area I strongly discourage you from approaching strangers in East Oakland and asking around. Go down to the lake and try to sniff out someone blazing, then just ask them, or go out to San Francisco and ask around in Dolores Park. Alternatively just walk down Haight Street in SF - you will be asked if you want to purchase some. Or ask around at the bars Oakland.  In San Francisco, possession and consumption of Marijuana is classified as the very lowest priority for SFPD - lower than jaywalking. It is de-facto legal. Oakland takes it a step further than this - the actual sale of it is decriminalized."
oakland,3az8za,percussaresurgo,2,Wed Jun 24 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, possession of a small amount is at most an infraction (same level as a parking ticket) in all of California, so /u/inkjet_dipset don't worry if you happen to venture into somewhere like Berkeley (which would be worth checking out) or take a day trip to San Jose. Some cities, like SF and Oakland, as an unofficial policy, don't even enforce the infraction unless you're being an asshole about it, you have more than an ounce, or you're trying to sell it."

I've never taken a cab there, however-- I don't know where they'd let you out!    Your other option is to take a cab to Fruitvale BART then ride one stop south to Coliseum BART.  After the game you should most definitely take BART out-- I've never done a cab away from a baseball game but I've also never seen any cabs at the Coliseum.   You can ride BART out up to 19th St for the nightlife, as someone else suggested, or just back to Fruitvale BART and then do uber/lyft back home.  Other stuff you can get to from BART:  Grandlake area for some bars, restaurants, shops is 1 mile walk from either Lake Merritt BART or 19th st. BART.  A small oldtown area is near 12th st. BART, uptown is near 19th st. BART.  Telegraph Ave from about 40th to 50th streets is near MacArthur BART. Rockridge BART area has some restaurants.  Jack London Square is accessible from 12th st.

The OPD already knows when and where crimes are statistically more likely, which is why they patrol more heavily in, say, Fruitvale than they do in Rockridge. Considering the iffy 'success rate' of the software, not to mention the dodgy language of PredPol's ""guarantee"", I can't help feeling like the mayor is just volunteering to let us all get soaked.    There's no magic wand to make crime go away, and I'm honestly embarrassed and disgusted that Schaaf wants to piss away $158k on unproven fairy dust like this. What they need to do to reduce crime is engage positively with the public in all sectors -- thereby diminishing the OPD's ""us against them"" reputation -- and actually solve crimes and prosecute the criminals.

What it may just as likely catch, is the city screwing over asian and latino neighborhoods, which is, frankly, not what she's after.  The fact of the matter is that Oakland city government still acts as though we live in a two-race town."
oakland,3ay55z,JasonH94612,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is that Oakland city government still acts as though we live in a two-race town.   I'm not sure its fair to blame the entire city government for Ms. Brooks' hobbyhorse. The scuttlebutt I heard was that most of the council-members were skeptical, viewing the department as more about Brooks rewarding supporters than addressing equity, but Brooks wanted the department badly enough the outright refusal would have triggered some problematic infighting. So they compromised.  I do think it is significant that Gallo was the most openly opposed."
oakland,3ay55z,Ochotona_Princemps,2,Thu Jun 25 00:33:31 2015 UTC,"My understanding of Oakland politics reflects exactly your view, OP.  I concede that Ms Brooks may be alone in her retro view of Oakalnd reality.  Gallo's opposition reminds me of the old De La Fuente-Brooks/Reid fight about the Equal Access Ordinance, and the fact that heightened language requirements could limit African American access to city employment or promotions.  That was the nadir of black-brown political infighting here in town.  To actually stand up and oppose having city staff able to speak to taxpayers is shameful.  It looks like the rest of the Council decided it was worth it to buy Desley off.  What she may not like is that for the department to do its job effectively, it will have to have multi-lingual staff.  I think it would also do well to look at city line staff (Im talking to you, 1021) and figure out how such a diverse workforce allows itself to perpetuate any institutional racism."
oakland,3ay55z,JasonH94612,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's likelier that this will just be a sinecure for supporters than an entity which does any good.    I also worry that shunting it off into a ""race and equity"" department is the wrong approach.  Structural issues in government are the product of problems in departments which actually do things - like code enforcement, CPS, or the police department.  As police reform efforts are showing us, attaching outsiders to report on a dysfunctional organization doesn't change the organization except to encourage them to close ranks against the perceived carpetbaggers."

But, to save the small home from the wrecking ball and bulldozers, it will take a lot of will and enough cash to wheel it away. The peculiar little house at the corner of 52nd Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Way in North Oakland, surrounded by UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland’s five-story parking garage and medical offices, has to go. The hospital is expanding and needs the plot of land to build new outpatient offices.  The home is not historic. It’s just a house, said officials of the hospital that now owns it. But the three-bedroom house, nestled in the shadow of the hospital buildings, is like a real-life version of the house in Pixar’s hit movie “Up.” It was built 81 years ago on an empty corner lot in North Oakland. As time passed, the roads around it got bigger, small stores sprang up nearby, and the little baby hospital down the street became the big hospital just off to the left with the BART tracks across the way.  Refusal to sell  That meant the little house sat on prime real estate — the perfect place for the medical facility to expand. Hospital administrators made an offer, then another, and some time later, another.  Inside, Lawrence Bossola refused to sell.  So, the parking garage and medical offices grew around Bossola’s home, the front-yard lemon trees and rose bush were shaded a bit more than before. The aging owner didn’t care. His parents had built the house in 1934, and aside from some time in the Army during World War II, he had lived there his whole life.  “He didn’t want to move,” said his friend Al Gavello. “He liked it there.”  For years, the hospital inquired about purchasing the property, but Bossola would shake his head sadly and say that his dear mother was just too attached to it. And the hospital folks would go away, Gavello said.  “He keep telling them she didn’t want to sell it,” he added with a chuckle. “But she’d actually died years before that.” Time, however, passed and Bossola died, too, at age 87. A year later, in 2002, Gavello, acting as executor of the estate, sold the 1,040-square-foot house on the 5,355 square feet of land to the hospital for $325,000.  And then Gavello turned around and wrote a check for $25,000 — a donation to the hospital in Bossola’s name. His friend had never minded the progress that happened around his house, Gavello said. And Bossola loved the hospital, as well as all the activity that went on around it.  He just loved his little house more.  For the last 13 years, the hospital, now UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland, has used the house for administrative services, with the three bedrooms and the dining room acting as offices, and the kitchen as a small lunchroom. No one bothered to take down the old metal television antenna on the roof. A photo montage of Bossola and his parents hangs in the entryway. A lot of the original construction is still there, the kitchen cupboards and dining room built-in hutch. The original tile — cracked here and there — is still in the bathroom.  Needs to be cut in pieces  The Bossola home is priced right: It’s free. And the hospital will give the buyer the $20,000 it would otherwise cost to demolish the house. “It sounds great, and it can be great for the right opportunity,” said Doug Nelson, the hospital’s executive director of development and construction. Yet it will cost a lot more to move it off the lot and set it up somewhere else, he said. Also, it likely would have to be cut in pieces to fit it under the BART tracks, through streets or onto freeway on-ramps.  Still, no one at the hospital wants to see the house torn down, he said. While the hospital is required only to post the offer in legal notices, there will be far more effort put in it to try to find someone to adopt the house, Nelson said.  “We’re going to try to have the greatest outreach effort possible,” he said. “We’d prefer to see it relocated as well.” They will have about 90 days to find that special someone once the house is officially available, which hospital officials say will likely be later this month. Otherwise, the little “Up” house will have to go.  Gavello also hopes the house can be saved. But either way, his friend’s old house, the one surrounded by progress, won’t be there on that corner anymore. It’s sad, but that’s life, Gavello said.  “I can’t live in the past,” he said. “Times goes on.”"

It's not an overnight process.  From 2000 to 2010 that area of West Oakland experienced a significant influx of students, artists, punks and hippies, and that's the first stage of gentrification.  Was it as extreme as now?  No.  But the underlying dynamics are the same.  Farm City by Novella Carpenter was published in 2009.  It's pretty much a case study of first-wave gentrification.  If there's no gentrification, she doesn't live in West Oakland, period.  Her very presence is evidence of the phenomenon."

Then in 1971 they were changed to Golden State and played a half dozen games in San Diego,  but the remainder in Oakland. Think it was all Oakland after that."

It goes right over both 12th and 19th St., and ends right next to Lake Merritt, severely inhibiting people from accessing these stations for the morning commute. The parade starts at 10:00AM on a weekday. For those commuters who don't start in downtown Oakland, these throngs of people will be taking BART to the parade, despite the fact that the system is already basically over capacity at that time. I'm super stoked the parade is happening in Oakland where it belongs and not in SF, but I kinda wish they'd gone for an early afternoon start time to reduce conflict with rush hour. Let's just say I'll be riding my bike to the ferry that day instead of taking the train."

Not really a guess since there were at most a few thousand on the streets and the city has 400x that number of people in it. But my point is that there is a distinct lack of jubilance in this thread. People expressing excitement or support for the Warriors appear to be outnumbered by people showing express ambivalence, or even pessimism and cynicism.

oakland,3a4itk,georgemichaelbluth1,2,Wed Jun 17 19:14:01 2015 UTC,"We have 3 major franchises despite a population of less than 500,000...that's pretty remarkable, and constitutes 2 more teams than any other Bay Area city. 2/3 of our teams are drawing poorly these days, though, due to bad facilities (O.co) but there was a time when sports was what put Oakland on the map."
oakland,3a4itk,old_gold_mountain,2,Wed Jun 17 19:21:28 2015 UTC,"Is San Jose not a ""bay area city"" ?  Because they have the Sharks and the Earthquakes.    We have 3 franchises despite a population under 500k because they all depend on attendees from other nearby cities and towns, for example there's over a million people in Contra Costa County, and the county Oakland is in has a total population of 1.5 million.  Did I mention the 800k in SF county or the 1.8 million in Santa Clara county?    Speaking of Oakland teams as if they supported entirely by, or even primarily by Oaklanders is just a simple way of telling everyone you have no understanding of Oakland.  They're in Oakland simply because we happen to have the spot right in the center of the bay area, and because the land was cheap as hell- it was built in an area that was previously primarily industrial, after we went post industrial.    As for sports being what put Oakland on the map, I wonder if that's why we have dozens of documentaries about the black civil rights movement and the founding of the Black Panther Party, both of which were happening in the same year the coliseum/stadium complex was built..    You really need to actually read some Oakland history or better yet, go talk to some old Oaklanders, because you seem to have just made up everything you've said to make some sort of point."
oakland,3a4itk,djlewt,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:34:13 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but we have one of the most loyal and loudest fanbase in professional sports.

oakland,3a4itk,Chuckchuck_gooz,0,Wed Jun 17 22:52:36 2015 UTC,"I suppose that is true, I just always saw it as more an anomaly of cheap land in the central part of the Bay Area rather than a reflection of a sports-obsessed populace.  I just don't see nearly the number of people walking around in the area with sports jerseys/hats/etc. as I did in the midwest/east coast, and social events seem to be far less dominated by sports too.   Culture here just seems to have a much greater emphasis on personal endeavors (hiking/yoga/surfing/meditation), food and just hanging out in a park rather than the continual rotation of sports bars and big screen TVs in the basement that you see in other parts of the country."

The notion that fans or a hometown matters is an elaborate ruse to turn a sporting event into a money making machine.

oakland,3a614w,oaklandisfun,7,Wed Jun 17 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is just shoddy reporting from EBE.  For starters, the title of this article bothers me. There's no a priori reason why landlords prevailing in rent disputes is a bad thing.  I also notice a lot of weasel words in the article:  ""This is just one of many ways in which the rent board process can unfairly favor landlords...""  ""...it can still be an uphill battle...""  ""Concerns about the unfair burdens that tenants sometimes can face...""  ""...advocates said that renters often have to overcome many hurdles...""  ""...it's not always enough""  The author also provides a few anecdotes about abuses of the system, but no hard evidence that this is common. The only bit of objective evidence actually shows that tenants typically win these disputes.  Oakland has plenty of housing issues, but I think EBE is grasping at straws on this one."
oakland,3a614w,amnorvend,6,Wed Jun 17 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, the EBE is a pretty terrible paper. They want to tackle important issues like race, housing and social inequity, but their journalists either don't have the talent or resources to accomplish this without resorting to false or unsubstantiated narratives."
oakland,3a614w,georgemichaelbluth1,5,Thu Jun 18 06:54:07 2015 UTC,"not to mention that the article states that landlords win 25% of the cases.  From my numbers ( I am actually tallying the very same data) the Tenants prevailed in 65% of the 2013 cases; the landlords in 25% of the time and the rest of the cases were either dismissed, mediated and settled or were administratively handled and never got to a hearing.

Everyone in the middle will live in the suburbs. At least they wouldn't have to be a part of the socioeconomic clash any longer.
oakland,3a6xu4,keepoaklandshitty,3,Thu Jun 18 03:22:49 2015 UTC,If only we had an illuminating example nearby from which we could learn...
oakland,3a6xu4,Kalium,4,Fri Jun 19 06:08:08 2015 UTC,"City Council approves the project unanimously, which I think is a good thing.   I also think it's a good thing the pressure from the affordable housing interest groups squeezed $8 million+ out of the developer. I don't love their tactics and disagree with a lot of their beliefs, but hey, they got some concessions, even if they're seeing this as a major loss."
oakland,3a6xu4,georgemichaelbluth1,5,Thu Jun 18 06:48:25 2015 UTC,It's important to stop all market rate building so we can keep up the affordable housing lie without actually improving the situation.
oakland,3a6xu4,skyshadow42,9,Wed Jun 17 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"If you buy into the concept that increasing housing supply at any level will bring prices down for everyone, then you should accept that there is not a huge difference between adding market rate vs. adding subsidized housing, as long as the number of units is held constant.  The issue is that market-rate housing funds itself and doesn't require massive government spending. Subsidized housing is incredbily expensive and as such often cannot be built at anywhere near the scale that market-rate can."
oakland,3a6xu4,old_gold_mountain,3,Wed Jun 17 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"Well, you're hitting the nail right on the head: Oakland needs a lot more housing, not a little. The only way to accomplish that in a way that drives down prices is to build a lot of housing across all levels.   ""Affordable housing"" can't accomplish that for exactly the reason you point out. And, as a side note, it's a shitty system that fucks over people who can just barely afford an area in order to benefit people who can't quite afford the area."
oakland,3a6xu4,skyshadow42,4,Wed Jun 17 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"Good time for a reminder that in 2014, the Bay Area added 114,000 jobs, but only 8,000 new housing units.   Whether in the current deal or some other arrangement, there needs to be as many units as possible on this parcel, as soon as possible."

Lots of anarchists do though, and plenty were actually out during the ""riot"" (or whatever people are calling it?) So it had nothing to do with ""smashy enthusiasts"" being absent or uninterested. It had a lot to do with OPD's impressive strategy of containment. I'll be the first person to say that the cops have been very on top of things post-May Day."

Obama is due to speak at the U.S. Conference of Mayors being held this week in San Francisco.

Probably the highest risk of being robbed or assaulted is near MacArthur BART or any residential block with low lighting and empty houses, particularly at night. During daylight hours, her chances of being hassled or targeted are pretty slim, assuming common sense.  I recommend (a) don't walk alone at night if possible. (b) Don't flash your smart phone around. If she needs to check the time frequently, have her wear a watch. (c) If she's got a car, don't leave ANYTHING in it - not extra change, no old CD cases, nothing.   Bike theft is a thing here, too. Not just whole bikes, bike wheels, saddles, etc. If she's got a bike, local shops can give her advice on ways to make the bike and its parts harder to steal."

The last thing I wanted was to feel concerned about her getting home late from a night with friends. The Temescal area is for the most part pretty tame, there are some robberies in the area occasionally, but it is a big city and these things do happen. Temescal is a fun spot with a vibrant community. There are block by block changes in crime in the surrounding areas, but the last few years have not been terribly notable in that respect.

Some friends were seen putting their purses in the trunk of their cars and then they had them stolen; someone is always watching, don't hide valuables in the trunk after you park, do it beforehand if you must. Most crimes seem to be auto-related, as long as she's aware and doesn't stop for the random scammer feeling her out with light conversation, it's not a bad area."

oakland,39xxvk,c0bracommander,2,Mon Jun 15 21:53:26 2015 UTC,"Well, refer back to the pictures posted by /u/old_gold_mountain. When we are talking about Ruin Your Middle Eastern Wedding drones yes. But there also a lot of things we as a society are calling drones right now that are RC aircraft with some jazzy stabilization electronics and they are functionally the same as RC planes to anyone who isn't being pretty pedantic about the boundaries of the the hobby.   Of course, if that was a hobby of mine, I would be mighty pedantic about it since the amount of negative juju around drones right now, including the rc hobby ones, is huge."

oakland,39xxvk,0818,2,Tue Jun 16 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"I think the point, which in general I agree with, is that you are indeed correct, it doesn't take that much effort to ban anything: but it would be nice to have an actual reason. There have been RC planes for a long time, and some people really enjoy the hobby, and they haven't hurt anything. I don't do the drone thing myself, but I know people who have fun building them and playing with them.   Yeah, we can ban everything someone somewhere gets excited about but that doesn't mean we should. And if you want to get breathlessly excited about something, it would be better to spend more time thinking about more ways we can keep birds from damaging aircraft. A situation, it might be pointed out, that doesn't do the birds a hell of a lot of good either."

oakland,39w0wb,unpickle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"The Port of Oakland is a public agency governed by the City of Oakland   It's actually a lot more complicated than that. It is an ""enterprise agency"" operating outside the direct facilitation by the city and with its own operating budget that it is tasked with maintaining using only direct revenue.  FTA:   Since 1927 when it was formally incorporated, the Port of Oakland has existed nominally within, but functionally independent of, local government. The Oakland mayor nominates commissioners, and the Oakland City Council appoints them. Once appointed, the Oakland Board of Port Commissioners makes policy decisions on how to run the Port, and Port staff operates and manages the Port.  As an enterprise agency, the Port of Oakland has its own budget and is charged with generating the revenue to sustain its own operations. Though this belies a complex fiscal relationship between the Port and local governments. The Port doesn’t receive local tax dollars, but it does count on local, state and federal grants for major capital projects, a key fact for a capital-intensive industry. The Port contributes to local coffers in payments for the services it requires — police, fire, water, etc. — and the economic activity of the Port and its partners generates hundreds of millions in state and local taxes.   Emphasis mine."

And it's not like Oracle is bringing in business anywhere near the stadium, because well... there are no businesses near that stadium. People drive in to park in the lot or take bart there, see the game, and then leave. No money goes to Oakland businesses. While this may make some people butt hurt here, the bay area in general rather have the Warriors in SF (lets be honest, it's the bay areas ""capital city"" and much nicer place to hang out after and before the game). Before you all tell me how great Oakland is, I know! I am from the East Bay and Oakland gets way more negative attention than positive, but SF is still the better city for professional game goers. Also SF is a much much much wealthier city that can handle the cost a new stadium.   ""Fuck SF"" sounds like an Oakland homer, and not someone who is looking at how much better it actually is for Oakland to not get a stadium. Let SF take on that burden. Do you think this series is actually going to make more people visit Oakland? A non traditional tourist city? Or make people spend more money in a part of city that has almost no business unless you want to cross the 880. I get that many people from Oakland are ""frustrated"" that the city doesn't get enough love, but lets not let this become a naive ""the warriors are an oakland team"" thing. Most people form outside California don't even know the Warriors are in Oakland. They just assume they are in SF. Source I live in the midwest now, and when ever people hear this from me they act surprised. This series is the first time the teams location in Oakland has really been advertised nationally in decades. Only hardcore NBA fans would probably know the team was ever in Oakland. Im sorry, but I think it's best that this team is bound for SF. Oakland, lets not be butt hurt over this. It's for the best of the city, and for the best of bay area fans.   Edit: I'm guessing you are not a sports fan, because Oakland actually has more professional teams than SF. There is only ONE (Giants, Niners are in SC now) in the city and THREE in Oakland. So wouldn't that mean Oakland has too many teams? Also IDK how people feel on here about Gentrification. But If you also expect a new stadium... that will basically be the tipping point of gentrification to where ever it is built, and all those ""real people"" (as some say) that lived in Oakland will end up moving to a shithole like Stockton or Bakersfield (no offense). And on top of that it's not like most Oakland natives can even afford to go to a Warriors game anymore. They have jacked up their prices so much it's a joke. Going to a basketball game is for yuppies and upper middle class people now. Have you seen the demographics at those games? IDK how anyone can connect the Warriors to being an Oakland team other than the current location. Maybe the warriors do some charity in Oakland? But I'm sure they could still do that even in SF."

My kid is toddler, so I haven't scoped out high schools yet. However, I do know that the public school lottery in Oakland is ulcer-inducing and the choices can be uneven. If you're looking for private high school, there are even more choices.   Your best bet is to check out Berkeley Parents Network. You may not be able to join yet (it's a requirement that you be a current or former Bay Area Resident AND have children of any age), but you can read school reviews and the archives. It's Bay-Area-wide, so it's not just Berkeley. Tons of info about Oakland, too.   https://www.berkeleyparentsnetwork.org/  If you are able to join BPN, you should post your question in their advice wanted newsletter and you'll probably get more info than you need about neighborhoods + high schools."

You can see a truck parked on the sidewalk behind the sign and someone getting out. It looked like those guys were going into the lot to their right and were unlocking the gate but it's also possible they were there to correct the sign or where the ones who changed it in the first place. I didn't really get a good luck at them but I think it was two people and they looked to be wearing utility outfits. I swear someone yelled something about the Warriors as I rode past but I didn't hear them clearly. Looking more closely at the picture, it seems now based on the direction the truck is facing, they were there for something related to the sign. Or maybe they just parked in a weird direction.

There is a large padded area that's great for deadlifts, whether off the floor or the rack. I'm pretty sure they have thick mats you can use if you want to do deficit pulls too. My guess is that Great Western is similar, although I believe my buddy told me that Ironworks has more rack area.  If you join one Touchstone gym, you have access to them all, so that's nice. The downside is they're kinda pricey, like $70/mo., since they have a bunch of climbing walls to maintain. If you have no interest in climbing, Tufunga would be a better deal. I haven't checked them out yet, but I've heard good things and I just might end up switching to them from Ironworks."

They're saying 100% of profits go to workers, but who decides what is profit and what needs to be re-invested back into the business? How is ownership managed? Will the workers have ownership? Will they be part of the decision-making process? they say they want to turn this into a franchise. Who will control the franchise and brand? If the workers have control then what is the decision-making process? If there is any form of centralized top-down control or ownership in your model, then what is going to prevent those in control from changing the rules for the worse later? Or from selling individual shops or the franchise as a whole?  It is very suspicious that none of this information seems to be available on their kickstarter campaign."

By paying himself a large salary, or paying above market rates to his wholly-owned roasted, the proprietor of this project could easily lower 'profits' and direct more money to himself.  That's not to critique this project or accuse the owner of wrongdoing--he sounds legit.

All of this is part of Konte's ongoing efforts to demonstrate that the coffee business isn't, and has never been, the exclusive domain of ""fastidious white hipsters,"" as he put it in a recent interview with Berkeleyside Nosh. According to Konte, there's a deep irony in the fact that certain (mostly white) segments of the industry act as though they're the first ones who ever knew exactly which farm their coffee beans came from, or roasted the beans in a certain way to maximize their flavor. The truth is that kind of approach has existed for a long time in Africa, where coffee was invented — but few folks in the so-called ""third wave"" coffee industry ever acknowledge it. (The most hilarious example of this kind of cultural appropriation: the recent fad interest in ""Bulletproof coffee,"" for which brewed coffee is blended with butter — a process Konte said is just a variation on something Ethiopians have been doing for centuries.) Part of Red Bay Coffee's mission is to reclaim that cultural heritage."

Calm down son, your people still hold almost all positions of political and financial power in this country, most of the U.S.'s capital, still get hired twice more than similarly qualified PoC applicants, and still get treated real nice by the police.

I merely said he was taking pot shots at whites based on their race, and I stand by what I said.  I didn't say it was racist nor did I make any reference to any victims here or claim anybody is disadvantaged.

The area near Oracle Arena isn't worth spending time around. It's ghetto.  There's a cool Farmer's Market at Jack London every Sunday, but it ends around 2 so you'd miss it. Still though, there are a collection of good restaurants at JLS and it's near the water so you can get a nice pier walk in, grab a meal/snacks, and make it back to the game in time for the tip off.

JLS is more touristy and sanitized I guess, if that's what you're looking for, but it's also a bit isolated (and as OP says, not really convenient to BART. For the lake you can get off at Lake Merritt BART, it's still a few blocks from the lake but not a bad walk, nicer than the walk to JLS, and then you can do a nice ~1 hour loop around the lake. The only eatery right on the lake is the Chalet which isn't bad but there are plenty of options not far from the lake. If you have little kids the walk to and from BART plus the loop might be a little much so you might want to think about taking a cab for part of the way."

If walking from BART, I'd suggest using 19th st station. It's about the same distance, but you can go by children's fairyland, the Lake Merritt gardens, and the bird sanctuary on the way.

A historical analogue is that during the Vietnam War protests, the police found that the most effective way to remove the large following that protest organizers cultivated was to start arresting those that were the least committed to the movement.   Legit peaceful protests don't exactly do wonders for Oakland's image or business there.

Not a bad idea conceptually, but totally unfeasible retrospectively. The time to make such demands is when negotiating deals. But since cities are totally incompetent at negotiating with private entities in situations like this with owners of an artificially scarce thing like a pro team who can pit city against city, I don't hold out any hope of that happening. Let the teams go, better yet kick them out. As for currently unfeasible ideas, at a state or national level, make civic extortion illegal."

As great as it would be to have the Raiders, As, and Warriors stay in Oakland, you can't  reasonably  believe that the taxbase/people of Oakland should bear the cost of, not 1 but 3 new pro stadiums.  If they want new stadiums, they should build them and do so in a way that doesn't add a huge burden the people of Oakland. That's not the common model of funding used to build new stadiums these days.  I feel not just Oakland but most all cities don't get back what they have to put in for new stadiums."

oakland,38u5xh,abritinthebay,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I can see how in a democracy we might want to subsidize certain industries but after looking at the map of top baseball team likes on Facebook by county I think the net needs to be cast wider than a particular city. Perhaps San Francisco can subsidize a team because of it's unique economy but, as we've seen, the sport with the least benefits and the biggest costs -- football -- left the city to get more capital contributions while the Giants, who probably could have gotten some kind of Bay Area-wide subsidy, were able to finance their own venue that is actually an architectural asset to the city and doesn't create a black hole when it's empty.    The A's and Raiders are in a tougher position due to Giants' and 49ers' stronger market share in Alameda and Contra Costa counties but I know the fans are there. While difficult politically, it seems to me that the most viable option economically and fairest politically would be to use a market study of where people live that go to games and watch the games and ask taxpayers in these areas to chip in to help Oakland and Alameda County out. Perhaps that would mean that San Francisco County and Stanislaus County (Stockton) would help out, too. After all you can't have the Harlem Globetrotters without the Washington Generals."

oakland,38u5xh,Lockwood2988,7,Tue Jun 9 03:16:20 2015 UTC,Oakland is around the 45th most populace city in the nation just below Miami and above Minneapolis. It is as wealthy as any city of it's size in the country- in terms of property values and tax base it is likely in the top 20.   All that being said these teams are parasites and should be either forced out or made to pay their own way.
oakland,38u5xh,Commentariot,10,Sun Jun 7 03:14:06 2015 UTC,They're not parasites in and of themselves unless the city decides to pour money into them.
oakland,38u5xh,old_gold_mountain,2,Sun Jun 7 03:34:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed, this is a lot different that the U.S. providing subsidies to oil companies in an obscure portion of the tax code. Votes to subsidize the capital costs of stadiums are almost always publicly debated. It's just that politicians don't want to be stuck with the blame of ""losing"" a team that couldn't self-finance its venue. Since it tends to be public, I don't have a problem with it.  It's stuff like the Seattle situation where voters turned down a stadium subsidy and the legislature stepped in at the last minute that was annoying. But even then, I guess there was a debate."
oakland,38u5xh,chrispmorgan,2,Sun Jun 7 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"Setting aside what to do next, I'm actually a little surprised a city of Oakland's size got these teams in the first place. Perhaps it was more prosperous, nationally speaking, back in the 60s. Does anybody have an opinion?"
oakland,38u5xh,chrispmorgan,7,Sun Jun 7 00:25:51 2015 UTC,"Well, the size of the city proper is a little less relevant than the size of the full metro region from which the team can draw fans/viewers/corporate sponsors. Alameda + Contra Costa alone is 2.6 million people--pretty big, bigger than the Cleveland, Pittsburg, Portland, and San Antonio metros. The full bay is 7.5M, so even splitting the fan base with the SF teams leaves lots of potential support."

oakland,38tifr,Oaklandish,4,Sun Jun 7 23:19:44 2015 UTC,"Here’s one article I was able to find.  To flesh that out a bit from what I recall from other articles at the time:   A man (Arthur Jarvis Raleigh) ran from a traffic stop by officer Bryan Franks. Witnesses reported seeing Raleigh throw something over a fence about half a block before Franks caught up to him. According to Franks, Jarvis had a revolver which he was in the process of pointing at Franks when Franks shot him three times in less than a second. Franks claimed Jarvis then threw the revolver over the fence just before he died. According to Chief Jordan, Franks’ footage showed no evidence that Jarvis had a weapon when Franks confronted and shot him. (OPD refused to show the footage to the victim’s family or attorney). Jordan had former SFPD officer Alexander Jason review the footage as an independent expert. Jason concluded that Franks’ life was in danger, in spite of there being no weapon visible; but Jordan apparently rejected Jason’s conclusion and did not initially include it in the “Skelly packet” he provided Franks when Franks appealed his dismissal to arbitration. Jason informed Franks’ attorney of the omitted report; when Franks requested it, Jordan reversed Franks’ dismissal and agreed to investigate why Jason’s conclusion had been left out of the Skelly packet. That seems to have been the end of the matter, and Franks’ footage (AFAIK) was never released to the public."

My favorite part was when they walked through the First Friday crowd and claimed they were numbered in the hundreds, and then an hour later once First Friday ended, there were 50 or so posting on Twitter to try to get more people, and then after that failed they tried to antagonize police for responding so heavily to the protest. You can see this corraborated on the occupyoakland Twitter.   There was also the part where one streamer begged for donations numerous times to pay his rent.   The police even tried to talk to the protestors to see if there was a way they could facilitate them marching down telegraph through downtown. They wanted them to march - just not get stupid and smash things. This was received with lots of yelling and anger.   The facebook event organizing this protest (and the one apparently happening right now) claim they want to abolish the police and the state. Good luck folks!"

oakland,38t595,AtomicGarden,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:24:46 2015 UTC,There was like a 3 to 1 police to protester ratio. It seemed like an absurd money dump for such a small peaceful protest.

Libby got blasted when the May Day protest was larger and more destructive than OPD was ready for.  Pretty clear the new plan is to respond to everything with overwhelming numbers and strict enforcement, to try to quash stuff early. You're right that it must be very expensive; we'll see how long they keep it up."

May Day Protests tend to be large though, I don't know why they didn't see that coming it is a huge international protest day known for clashes with authorities that just seems like a failing on the police/Schaaf's leadership.   I think this article articulates my point about the cost being way over the benefits of clamping down on protests.

On the contrary, money very well-spent on continuing to develop Oakland's future reputation as a reasonably attractive place to live and do business.   Public image counts considerably when hi tech firms, housing developers, etc. think about coming to Oakland. In the grand scheme of things paying a few hundred thousand in police overtime to dampen the spirits of the childish Occupy-type protestors is worth millions to billions in investment over a period of years."
oakland,38t595,AtomicGarden,2,Sun Jun 7 06:35:14 2015 UTC,"Heh--I'm not sure you intend this, but if you're correct that means that the smashy-smashy folk actually have a rational strategy. Although housing development doesn't drive gentrification, additional employment centers certainly do. If the protests keep out high-tech or other new firms from Oakland, that would probably reduce pressure on rents.  I'm pretty skeptical that protests will actually have that effect; I think you might be giving them too much credit."
oakland,38t595,LindaDanvers,0,Sun Jun 7 19:42:30 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, money very well-spent on continuing to develop Oakland's future reputation as a reasonably attractive place to live and do business.   I agree, and the stereotype that drives these businesses away is that Oakland is crime ridden, I think the stereotype as more to do with general crime than protests. For instance Seattle has a similar disruptive activist community that does stupid shit like Oakland protesters do but they still manage to attract business. Oakland has already spent 7 million dollars on policing protests of which only some of them need such a large police force. They could take that money to spend it on other crime prevention measures."
oakland,38t595,AtomicGarden,4,Sun Jun 7 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"It seemed like an absurd money dump for such a small peaceful protest.   What a ridiculous comment. After all of the crap that Oakland has endured with prior protests, I'd say it was exactly what they needed to do."

The Oakland airport is right down the street and tourists tend to leave nice things in their rental cars. The highway is also right there for a quick getaway. The private security driving around have not been very helpful, the times I have witnessed them. Also, dues to staff shortages, Oakland police will not respond in a timely manner.

Sometimes its good with no insane people complaining loudly, or trying to push in the line. It's maybe a 15-20 minute wait on a good day. Problem is most people expect that their simple errand should only take 5 minutes. They lose patience very quickly. Some people don't make a big deal of it and wait in line quietly, other people make a scene and miserable for everyone else and the employees.   The other half of the time its been a complete shit show. Someone is fighting with a worker, people jumping the line (out the door probably), someone is yelling racist shit, worker tells you the wrong info and gives you attitude. Just a really unpleasant place to be stuck for 40 minutes (very warm) room with 20 really pissed off people with one worker trying to do the work of 4 while the crazy preacher lady yells her deranged nonsense from outside on repeat.   A fun story I have from there was a media mail shipment of books. Not a large box, but had a bit of weight to it. Not overly heavy by any means. Worker picks it up, puts it back down and says ""I can't lift that."" She disappears and I have no idea whats going on. Standing at the window feeling like a knob, getting death stares from those waiting in line. She appears 2 minutes later behind me and tells me to follow her.

When these are the primary reactions of everyone else in the US who's watching the finals, it's pretty tough to spin Oakland as the fun, vibrant place to live that it is, and much easier and more palatable to either play up its proximity to a well-known tourist city or erase it altogether.  I'd even hazard a guess that the Warriors position themselves as ""Golden State"" and not ""Oakland"" to avoid having the team itself portrayed as thugs and gangsters. And on that note, they probably don't want to be associated with the same city as the Raiders (or their mostly gangster/thuggish fanbase) either."
oakland,38iy6n,Navi1101,10,Thu Jun 4 18:21:19 2015 UTC,They are called Golden State because when they moved from SF their plan was to play half their games in Oakland and half in San Diego
oakland,38iy6n,CACuzcatlan,9,Thu Jun 4 18:52:42 2015 UTC,"Kinda - they named themselves Golden State after the move but they'd already been playing in SF, San Jose, and then Oakland and San Diego, so it made sense.  They've never been the Oakland Warriors and I hear them mention that the arena is in Oakland multiple times a game so I think people are just being needlessly touchy."
oakland,38iy6n,abritinthebay,3,Thu Jun 4 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it, I did notice during a finals game that they started with an aerial shot, ""Oakland, California...""  Of course, they were rather obviously showing Alameda, but whatever."
oakland,38iy6n,skyshadow42,2,Thu Jun 4 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"Haha, well to be fair - local news often screws THAT up. It's like ""yeah, in the shot I guess Oakland is BEHIND Alameda.. but.. k"".  They showed the Tribune Building and some shots of the Lake a bunch last time."

oakland,38iy6n,Navi1101,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:01:09 2015 UTC,You sound pretty ignorant to be honest. The Raiders do not have anymore of a thuggish and gangster fanbase than other teams. Maybe in the 70s when NWA adopted their image but in reality the Niners have had a much more violent fan base recently (and a variety of other teams). Also Oakland IS routinely being touted as a hip and fashionable place to live.

When I've lived outside of the bay, that's certainly how people talked about Raiders fans. Having never been to a Raiders game, I have no idea if this reputation is deserved."
oakland,38iy6n,heymeowmeow,3,Fri Jun 5 03:59:46 2015 UTC,"Having been to both Raiders and Niners games - I felt waaay more unsafe at Raiders games. Not that I particularly cared personally but to deny it's a part of the bravado of the fan base is just myopic.  It's there, it's actually encouraged by most of the Raider Nation stuff I see. It's just more aggressive and... rowdy. That's not always a bad thing but it IS there."

But none of those were at Candlestick/Levi's and we've been talking about home atmosphere here.  Now for Oakland at home, while nothing super recent, there were 5 incidents between 2007 and 2011.

It'll be interesting to see if ABC shows exterior shots of Oakland, or of SF. :)  Edit: FTA-   Visit Oakland, the city’s tourism arm, felt the same fatigue at seeing Fisherman’s Wharf shots during Warriors games. So Kim Bardakian, its director of public relations, approached ESPN/ABC producers with suggested locations to shoot in Oakland. On Wednesday, she said the sister networks “committed to using Oakland imagery 75 percent of the time during the Finals.”"

There's always been some kind of protest but the message seemed a lot more 'real' when it was Oscar Grant. The local buildings were still smashed up and there was graf everywhere, but it wasn't the majority of the people participating doing the damange. Also the police response seemed way out of line in general for the earlier protests. I felt the protests were warented.  6 years later it's a joke. A handful of people come out, smash up some windows and expect everyone else to care? Sorry, when the only thing I get from your message is that the Chinese mobile phone shop on my block needs it's windows smashed- I stop caring and start hoping someone will stop you. Good on the mayor for finally doing something. Sticking to the sidewalks and not breaking random windows sounds great to me!

oakland,38e7wd,newtooakland,3,Thu Jun 4 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the apparent hypocrisy, but what makes you think it's appropriate for a white person to try to direct a movement that's by and for black people? Yes, we all know anyone is able to put themselves in another's shoes, but just the nature of putting yourself in another's shoes means you don't actually get it, and are simply attempting to. The fact that it's an exercise for people to do this demonstrates that it isn't the same as full understanding. Contributions from that deficient perspective aren't anything the relevant parties haven't heard or thought of before, and furthermore any perspective is tainted by where that person came from and how they grew up. White Americans simply do not have the socialized capacity to understand this issue and provide useful information to the people who have been working at this their entire lives. To black Americans it is actually relevant to their day-to-day and a life-and-death matter. That is absolutely not the case for white Americans.   Consider also the petulance of quitting something you believe in just because you've been deemed not experienced enough to be a useful contributor. Suppose someone was working in a restaurant as a dishwasher; what kind of person is it that quits when they don't get to order people around and design the menu? If someone was invested in Ferguson, for what reasons? If it's solely about police brutality, then go join Copwatch or one of the hundreds of organizations devoted to lessening police power and increasing accountability. If it's about the effects of white supremacy and racism, as most of Ferguson's activity was, why in the world should a white person have a say? Whites' thought contributions to issues of racial equality can only be as a voice to other white people. And I don't mean ""those are the rules,"" I mean literally, that is how the world works. That's how you utilize your empathy and ability to picture the situation of people who actually know what they're talking about. Not by going ""Well I read a book, here's what I think."" You're talking to people who write the books you've read. White people's usefulness in this fight (and they are an important part) is to raise awareness in their own communities and argue the case laid out by black activists. If you don't fully agree, then fine, but that's why you don't get to talk at rallies and meetings.    This stuff falls along racial lines, but it doesn't have to do with one race being inherently better or worse, it has to do with what nearly all black Americans have experienced and what any white American, by design of the country and white supremacy, have and will never."

It isn't that white people are naturally so stupid and deficient as to be useless, it's that they have never suffered the same damages of racism (by design of the racial hierarchy) and thus have no useful insight to offer people who are the defined ""lesser"" class that are intimately aware and affected by the issue.   Race is fake, but that doesn't mean the idea has no power. It in fact has enormous power and is how the country is run.

oakland,38e7wd,thro_a_wai,6,Wed Jun 3 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"I know this will be unpopular, but let's discuss the issues about why people are protesting.  This particular event is going to be born from first Friday. Now first Friday as a whole, is not about protesting, but it  has been a place where like minded people get together and communicate. Bred out of that communication are emotions and thoughts that pertain to society. These thoughts then get acted out in what is 95% of the time is a peaceful protest. There are always ""bad apples"", which is a term I hate but is prevalent in media today, especially in regards to the police force. Protestors aren't even given the benefit of the doubt on that. It's very clear the understanding by the majority of the people is that it's just a bunch of idiots that enjoy destroying stuff. It's not. It's about deep rooted social/ economical issues. Now I do agree that during these events the true meaning gets a little blurred, but you have to understand not all people are there for the same EXACT reason. The reason comes down to to one thing, and that's social/ economic justice. Something that only a few people in the country truly have. So protesting is a necessity whether we like it or not. If a few building get a little busted up in the name of progress, then so be it.   But here's the thing, I do not think that Libby Schaaf did the curfew to curb the protestors that range from 100-200 people on good nights. It's to halt the masses win the warriors win/lose the championship. Look what happened to San Francisco when they won the World Series, or Vancouver  when they lost the Stanley cup. I do not support any curfew, but I do know what Libby Schaaf is smart. She knows exactly what she is doing. I have to give her credit.   Let's discuss these issues as a community. I love this city and I want to see it move forward."
oakland,38e7wd,Nalph_Rader,4,Wed Jun 3 23:30:54 2015 UTC,Why don't the protesters go to Ferguson?  Virtually EVERYONE in Oakland opposes racism and police violence. The ONLY thing the asshole protesters are accomplishing is creating more racism and more violence.
oakland,38e7wd,Kalium,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:45:00 2015 UTC,"I know this will be unpopular, but let's discuss the issues about why people are protesting.   No.  I refuse to reward vandalism by responding to it with what the vandals purport to want. That will only lead to more vandalism. I have exactly zero desire to make extortion the primary mode through which politics are enacted. I don't know what the protests were about and I actively refuse to know.  Protesters have been given the benefit of the doubt in the very recent past. Remind me, are the windows on Auto Row all replaced yet?"
oakland,38e7wd,Nalph_Rader,-2,Thu Jun 4 06:46:16 2015 UTC,"I never said vandalism did I? I never said let's discuss vandalism. I said let's discuss the root cause of the protest. Vandalism as a whole I don't agree with, minus graffiti. But I would rather see some passionate people protesting about something important to society. A car dealership is not important to society. There seems to be a disconnect between humans. It seems that most of you are more offended by a few broken windows than seeing a teenager bleeding in the streets. Would you rather be a corporation that has to have your insurance policy by some new windows, or be a parent burying your child? Are we still considering corporations as people?"

oakland,38e7wd,Nalph_Rader,0,Thu Jun 4 19:13:34 2015 UTC,It is not a small business. How many people lost their jobs from the dealership?
oakland,38e7wd,Nalph_Rader,-3,Thu Jun 4 18:01:19 2015 UTC,I'm also willing to bet that the dealership does not hire local. Which is a problem within itself
oakland,38e7wd,Kalium,-2,Thu Jun 4 18:02:21 2015 UTC,I said let's discuss the root cause of the protest.    And I said no. I refuse to discuss whatever cause the violent people at hand choose to claim to advance through violence.

I've been out there plenty of times and have seen other protesters turn people away from harming small local businesses. Unfortunate what happened with the Hyundai Dealership, but there are probably more people being employed from the clean up and the restoration of the vehicles so it's actually a job creator in a sense.   I'm just being a dick, and I'm tired of hearing the small business argument. Go out on the streets tomorrow night, watch small businesses get protected by others in the crowd."

oakland,38e7wd,Nalph_Rader,-2,Thu Jun 4 21:29:42 2015 UTC,"You are clearly missing the point of protests. Protests are meant to grab attention from ignorant civilians like yourself. And since you are clearly stating you are new to Oakland, then I'm assuming that you don't know that this city was built on blue collar, hard working activists. Always has been, and always will be. Where are you from originally? If you don't mind me asking. I think it will put more context in why you are so ignorant."
oakland,38e7wd,newtooakland,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:20:52 2015 UTC,Could you explain to an ignorant civilian like myself how the city being built on blue collar activists justifies violent protests?
oakland,38e7wd,Nalph_Rader,-1,Thu Jun 4 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"I think the unexplainable militarization of our local police, and sheriffs department is a cause for protest. I think gentrification is a valid reason to protest. And I think the systematic abuse on minorities should be protested. I do not think they should turn violent. I never said that. I've never said I wanted that. But when ignorant people like you disregard the social injustice that is occurring before our eyes then maybe a broken window is important. We are talking about it now aren't we? Why are you more offended by a broken building then HUMAN beings getting hurt? It hurts me that people don't see it for the bigger picture. Simple minded people have simple minded thoughts, and you continue to prove that."

oakland,38e7wd,Nalph_Rader,2,Thu Jun 4 19:22:32 2015 UTC,"What are you doing to change it? Also your question wasn't even valid and made no sense.

I said that simply because you are new to Oakland, and might have wanted to know that. And we should keep the tradition alive. Keep Oakland, oakland. Got it?"

oakland,38dukc,DebtOn,2,Wed Jun 3 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"That's been getting a lot of superficial attention, but looking at the actual Surplus Land Act statute makes it seem like the complaints aren't very meritorious.  The relevant provision is Government Code §54222, which states in relevant part:   Any agency of the state and any local agency disposing of surplus land shall, prior to disposing of that property, send a written offer to sell or lease the property as follows:    (a) A written offer to sell or lease for the purpose of developing low-and moderate-income housing shall be sent to any local public entity as defined in Section 50079 of the Health and Safety Code, within whose jurisdiction the surplus land is located.  Housing sponsors, as defined by Section 50074 of the Health and Safety Code, shall, upon written request, be sent a written offer to sell or lease surplus land for the purpose of developing low- and moderate-income housing.  All notices shall be sent by first-class mail and shall include the location and a description of the property.  With respect to any offer to purchase or lease pursuant to this subdivision, priority shall be given to development of the land to provide affordable housing for lower income elderly or disabled persons or households, and other lower income households.   A ""local public entity"" is any city, county, redevelopment agency, or  housing authority; here, the only relevant such entity would be Oakland itself. ""Housing Sponsors"" are only entitled to receive an offer to sell if they submit a written request for such an offer.   So on the face of things I don't see the alleged violation."
oakland,38dukc,DebtOn,2,Wed Jun 3 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"Actually more relevant is this part, where if they don't have a bidder to build affordable housing, requires at least 15 percent of the project to be affordable housing. The plan was originally to have no affordable housing and then, after having a City Council meeting shut down, they bumped it up to 10 percent:     If the local agency does not agree to price and terms with an entity to which notice and an opportunity to purchase or lease are given pursuant to this article and disposes of the surplus land to an entity that uses the property for the development of 10 or more residential units, the entity or a successor-in-interest shall provide not less than 15 percent of the total number of units developed on the parcels at affordable housing cost, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, or affordable rent, as defined in Section 50053 of the Health and Safety Code, to lower income households, as defined in Section 50079.5 of the Health and Safety Code. Rental units shall remain affordable to, and occupied by, lower income households for a period of at least 55 years. The initial occupants of all ownership units shall be lower income households, and the units shall be subject to an equity sharing agreement consistent with the provisions of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 65915. These requirements shall be contained in a covenant or restriction recorded against the surplus land prior to land use entitlement of the project, and the covenant or restriction shall run with the land and shall be enforceable, against any owner who violates a covenant or restriction and each successor in interest who continues the violation, by any of the entities described in subdivisions (a) to (f), inclusive, of Section 54222.5."
oakland,38dukc,DebtOn,3,Wed Jun 3 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"If the local agency does not agree to price and terms with an entity to which notice and an opportunity to purchase or lease are given pursuant to this article   Seems like that section only applies if an entity was entitled to receive a offer to purchase or lease--i.e., that provision is triggered  only if a ""housing sponsor"" submits a written request for an offer to sell/lease.   If there's no written request there's no ""entity to which notice and an opportunity to purchase or lease"" was given, and that provision isn't triggered."
oakland,38dukc,DebtOn,2,Wed Jun 3 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"What? Because they didn't open it to other offers they have no obligation to follow the affordable housing restriction? That's your interpretation of this?  To be clear, both CMs Kalb and Gallo raised concerns about that 15 percent requirement and whether the proposed project was legal when they abstained. Gallo actually asked the city attorney to comment on whether that applied and she said she couldn't discuss it in open session."
oakland,38dukc,georgemichaelbluth1,3,Wed Jun 3 19:50:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just a lawyer reading the statute. The plain language of the statute states that the affordable housing requirement only comes into play if the government entity fails to sell to an entity which was entitled to receive a offer to sell. And, per Section 54222, nonprofits are entitled to receive an offer to sell only if they submit a written request for such an offer.  I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing; its just how the statute appears to be structured. I'd agree that it's not a particularly well-drafted law."

oakland,38b0z9,cyclicalthought,4,Wed Jun 3 01:27:16 2015 UTC,I took a lyft from downtown.  It was a bit less than $20 for me.
oakland,38b0z9,DrVentureWasRight,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:03:36 2015 UTC,This.  Order a lyft line with the 10-minute waiting period option and it'll be pretty cheap for you.  Arriving an hour early (just enough time to check your bags) is your best bet -- it's never taken me or my friends more than 15 mins to get through security and find the right terminal.  OAK is pretty lax/fast when it comes to those things.

The airport will be pretty deserted so I wouldn't bother getting there more than 60 minutes before boarding. (While I don't recommend it if you can avoid the risk, I've managed a few times to catch Sunday morning flights after arriving to the airport 20 minutes before departure)."

It's not often that crowded but I always suggest 90mins for domestic and 2hrs for International. It means at worst you get to eat some food, relax, and find a good seat if you get through security early.  At best - it means you have PLENTY of time for any delays in security. Also check in the night before, it'll save you lots of time."

The City of Rockford (1972) holds that cities have the right to regulate time, place and manner of protests, with restrictions spelled out in Ward v. Rock Against Racism (1989).  Upshot: The city can ban protests at night so long as they can show significant interest in doing so (they can) and don't apply the restrictions to one group while not restricting another (they aren't)."
oakland,384h1c,oaklandaway,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:50:40 2015 UTC,"Right, and your interpretation of the law is misleading and could lead someone to believe that you went out and cherry picked a few cases to try and prove your point (in a giant body of law that does otherwise, which leads to a side note - Wikipedia/Google will almost always fail you when trying to do legal research).  But saying that is just a sassy response to your first sentence. Here's why you're not correct on this issue:  Graynard's prohibition is much narrower than the one proposed by Schaaf.  It addresses protests that were disruptive to schools and found that noise ordinances aimed to stop schools from being disrupted could be enforced.  From the opinion:   We do not have here a vague, general ""breach of the peace"" ordinance, but a statute written specifically for the school context, where the prohibited disturbances are easily measured by their impact on the normal activities of the school.   It's hard to understand why you chose to cite Ward in this context.  That case is about a rock concert that challenged a city ordinance mandating city provided speakers and a city provided sound tech be used so that concerts permitted by the city and hosted on city property wouldn't be too loud.  The case is completely factually distinguishable from Schaaf's new directive and isn't instructive one way or the other.  The case cited in the article (but without proper credit being given) is Collins v. Jordan 110 F.3d 1363 (9th Circ. 1996).  It gives a great overview of First Amendment law in the context of protests:   The law is clear that First Amendment activity may not be banned simply because prior similar activity led to or involved instances of violence. There are sound reasons for this rule. Demonstrations can be expected when the government acts in highly controversial ways, or other events occur that excite or arouse the passions of the citizenry. The more controversial the occurrence, the more likely people are to demonstrate. Some of these demonstrations may become violent. The courts have held that the proper response to potential and actual violence is for the government to ensure an adequate police presence, see, e.g., Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 551 (1965), and to arrest those who actually engage in such conduct, rather than to suppress legitimate First Amendment conduct as a prophylactic measure. Kunz, 340 U.S. at 294-95. Courts have many times emphasized the importance of government's permitting the public to engage in spontaneous First Amendment activity, such as demonstrations, in response to controversial events. E.g., NAACP Western, 743 F.2d at 1346; see also Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373, (1976) (""The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.""). Banning or postponing legitimate expressive activity because other First Amendment activity regarding the same subject has resulted in violence deprives citizens of their right to demonstrate in a timely and effective fashion.   The 9th Circuit cannot be any clearer about the type of law Schaaf has enacted.  It's not Constitutional.  Here's some more reading from that case:   Activities such as demonstrations, protest marches, and picketing are clearly protected by the First Amendment. Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88 (1940); NAACP Western Region v. City of Richmond, 743 F.2d 1346 (9th Cir. 1984). It has been clearly established since time immemorial that city streets and sidewalks are public fora. E.g., United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983); Hague v. C.I.O., 307 U.S. 496, 515(1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.); accord Gaudiya Vaishnava Society v. City and County of San Francisco, 952 F.2d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir. 1990). Restrictions on First Amendment activities in public fora are ""subject to a particularly high degree of scrutiny."" NAACP Western, 743 F.2d at 1355. The law is also clear that the government may not prohibit angry or inflammatory speech in a public forum unless it is (1) ""directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action"" and (2) ""likely to incite or produce such action."" Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969) (per curiam); see also Hess v. Indiana, 414 U.S. 105, 108 (1973) (per curiam). Speech that stirs passions, resentment or anger is fully protected by the First Amendment. Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4 (1949) (""[A] function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger."").  California state law also reflects these fundamental constitutional principles. While California Penal Code § 407 defines unlawful assembly as ""whenever two or more persons assemble together to do an unlawful act, or do a lawful act in a violent, boisterous, or tumultuous assembly,"" the California Supreme Court has properly narrowed the statute, in accordance with the requirements of the First Amendment, to those assemblies ""which are violent or which pose a clear and present danger of imminent violence,"" In re Brown, 9 Cal. 3d 612, 623 (Cal. 1973). Thus, it is clearly established federal and state law that protests or assemblies cannot be dispersed on the ground that they are unlawful unless they ""are violent or . . . pose a clear and present danger of imminent violence,"" id., or they are violating some other law in the process.   Why are you so quick to relinquish your Constitutional rights?  TL;DR - Schaaf's ban on nighttime protests is almost certainly not Constitutional according to 9th Circuit and Supreme Court precedent.  (All bolding within citations are mine for effect)."
oakland,384h1c,Kalium,6,Tue Jun 2 01:01:23 2015 UTC,"That's generally a solid explanation of current law, but what are you referring to here:   the type of law Schaaf has enacted   My understanding is that there is no new law. There is a policy change; OPD is now strictly enforcing existing ordinances about pedestrians in the street in the context of nighttime protests.  So the line of cases addressing blanket curfews or bans on protests, such as Collins, aren't really on point here, right? If the new policy is unconstitutional, seems like it will be on some other grounds."
oakland,384h1c,MaSpoonIs2Big,-4,Tue Jun 2 03:13:20 2015 UTC,I think she may have caused herself problems when she stated explicitly that she was going to try and curb speech specifically using that policy.  Edited for clarity.

NAACP Western, 743 F.2d at 1355.""  That's from the same case.  The city is curtailing free speech by implementing a policy aimed at stopping protests on any given roadway in Oakland after dark. The roads have been established as public space ""since time immemorial.""  According to the courts, the proper way to deal with protest violence is to police violations as they occur instead of stopping the legitimate speech from happening.  It is baffling to me how quickly people on this sub want to ignore/get rid of their Constitutional protections over what are relatively minor, but admittedly pernicious, acts of vandalism.  Under the conception of First Amendment rights that many in this sub seem to support, it would be incredibly easy to do away with all protests.  The government would simply need to make sure there are undercover cops in protests egging people on or committing property damage themselves and then ban future protests based on that behavior.    The Constitution has been interpreted in a way that is strongly biased towards allowing the speech to occur despite potential negative consequences.  That's a good thing because it protects people from the government, which is way more powerful than a handful of anarchists, from behaving in ways that are despotic, even if a majority of the population agrees with its despotism."
oakland,384h1c,Kalium,3,Wed Jun 3 23:00:24 2015 UTC,"Alright, I know you're a lawyer, so you're above my level on this. However:  You're being deliberately selective. The very next passage from what you cited is:  The law is also clear that the government may not prohibit angry or inflammatory speech in a public forum unless it is (1) ""directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action"" and (2) ""likely to incite or produce such action."" Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1829, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) (per curiam); see also Hess v.

These protests have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, time and time again, that violence is indeed imminent. Smashed windows have occurred at every single protest, bar none (even the holiday ""protests"" with a dozen people), before these restrictions, in fact. As such, these restrictions fall well under the ambit of the legal discourse you are citing. Why did you stop right where you did without the following passage?  As I'll say again, these protests could've easily protected themselves from this if they just passed a resolution condemning violence. But they actively refuse to. They believe, and I know this because I have attended meetings and asked, that violence is a form of speech. And it is in that diehard and fundamentalist belief that they lose the moral high ground and the will of the people. They are wrong.  So don't attempt to camouflage this totally unorganized ""movement"" using the shining armor of Constitutional Rights. If these people were peacefully protesting they would have all of Oakland behind them--and be protected by the constitution. They aren't. They allow looters to run rampant and unchecked. This Constitutional Rights argument is textbook protest PR, it stinks, and the public can smell it.   These people want the loudest fucking megaphone to hear the sound of their own voices more than they want reform and Oakland can tell. Don't gloss over systematic destruction and looting by calling it ""vandalism"" and using cute vocab like ""pernicious"". Pernicious vandalism is writing a slogan on a bathroom wall.  And I won't except that this is all they can do to protest against a despotic government either. There are so many well organized political movements that actually make changes in the US. Movements like the Gay Rights movement are organized, peaceful, and incredibly effective. No one is smashing windows protesting Marriage Equality--and for good reason I might add.  This movement ate itself from the inside out. The public abandoning them, which it what these restrictions are, is the result. Welcome to Oakland."
oakland,384h1c,old_gold_mountain,-1,Thu Jun 4 02:05:47 2015 UTC,"Most of the protestors are peaceful.  The passage you bolded is narrowly defined.  Protests that sometimes result in vandalism isn't speech that directs or incites imminent lawless action.  The speech that passage refers to is speech like, ""hey everyone, I want you to go out there and burn down Oakland tonight,"" as opposed to the act of walking in the street at night.  Direct incitements to violence aren't protected, but protests in general are - even if they have lead to vandalism in the past.  I continue to think it's interesting that individuals focus on what is relatively minor property damage perpetrated by a small group of protestors compared to systemic racism perpetrated by the justice system and the other issues being protested.  I also think it's interesting that you believe the protestors have an obligation to police others.  ""Systematic looting and vandalism"" is what we saw in London, Ferguson, and to some extent Baltimore.  It's what occurred in L.A. in the early 90s.  Those cities were literally burning and thousands of people took part.  It's hyperbolic to suggest what has happened in Oakland is anything like that.  What's happened in Oakland doesn't even come close to the sports riots many U.S. cities have experienced in the past decade.  But, I agree that it is counterproductive and a nuisance.  You don't know the history of the LGBTQ rights movement.  One of the seminal events in that movement's history is often referred to as the Stonewall riots.  You also continue make blanket assumptions about the entire protest movement based on the actions of a small group of people within it.  As for the citations - I cited the part you accused me of leaving out more than once (it's how you're aware of it).  People on this sub are unwilling to accept the meaning of the case all of those cites are taken from.  The Ninth Circuit's conclusion is that protests cannot be foreclosed simply because they have been violent in the past - full stop.  ""Oakland"" can't tell anything and invoking ""the public"" is just odd.  Some people support the protests despite the vandalism and others don't.  Some people, like me, will always support the rights of individuals to protest, particularly in a country like ours where the government continues to behave in ways that make even systematic vandalism look like a tiny annoyance compared to the scale of the crimes committed by our government in our name.  Why focus on smashed windows when your government is spying on you, torturing people, targeting people of color for incarceration, engaging in its ridiculous war on drugs, and perpetuating policies that benefit billionaires and keep people in poverty?  Ultimately, your Constitutional rights are there regardless of whether or not 99 out of 100 people agree what you're doing or 0 out of 100 do.  That's what it means to have a Constitutional right to something.  It's not ""PR,"" it's the protection we're afforded as citizens even if other citizens don't like it."

oakland,384h1c,detaer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:26:46 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, your Constitutional rights are there regardless of whether or not 99 out of 100 people agree what you're doing or 0 out of 100 do. That's what it means to have a Constitutional right to something. It's not ""PR,"" it's the protection we're afforded as citizens even if other citizens don't like it.   Again, you have not addressed that these protests actively refuse to condemn violence and consider a legitamate form of speech. As such, their speech is not protected under our constitution. Answer that.  I'm wondering what type of law you practice. The passage is narrowly defined? Seems damn explicit to me--and to the council Libby consulted.   What's happened in Oakland doesn't even come close to the sports riots many U.S. cities have experienced in the past decade.   And this is where you clearly demonstrate that you're an out-of-towner who does fully understand the identity of this city. I'm really sorry be be insulting here, but sorry, this statement just screams short-term memory.   I might remind you that Oakland is the birthplace of the Black Panthers, the Home Headquarters of the Hells Angels. It has a long and storied history with more forms of protest than almost any other city--violent and otherwise. You can try to compare violence across cities, but it only underscores how in the dark you are.   As such, your next statement looks just foolish.   ""Oakland"" can't tell anything and invoking ""the public"" is just odd   Understanding these protests and what they accomplish is something unique to this city--and it transcends generations in a way no other city does. Protestors come and leave. Oakland lives and breathes it.  And these protests, literally chock full of people who just fucking moved here, at maximum are 1000-2000 people. That means there are 348,000 people who are* not marching.* You think Libby enacts strong-arm enforcement like this without people breathing down her neck to do something? Hell no. Business owners, neighborhood groups, letters from citizens all said the same thing: put an end to this shit. It's called ""the will of the people"", and it's what our democracy and effective action is based on.   Why focus on smashed windows when your government is spying on you, torturing people, targeting people of color for incarceration, engaging in its ridiculous war on drugs, and perpetuating policies that benefit billionaires and keep people in poverty?   Look at this statement justifying the violence! What the fuck are we protesting? Is it police violence? Rising income inequality? The war on drugs? What is the goal? What's the road map to change all this? There is none.  We're in one of the most liberal cities in the united states--these people would have massive support if they had even a shadow of plan. They very clearly do not. We know they care more about making a scene than making a change. And frankly, Oakland could give two shits."
oakland,384h1c,Kalium,-2,Thu Jun 4 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"You seem really upset about this and your response speaks to that emotion, but it's also hostile, insulting, ignorant, makes a ton of unfounded and inaccurate assumptions, and puts words in my mouth while willfully ignoring or avoiding the substantive points.   You've expended no energy trying to understand my position and instead have simply attacked me in any way you can think of (a few of which are patently ridiculous).  I'm not really interested in a discussion with someone who chooses to behave in that way because it is clear you would rather vent your feelings and be insulting than have a conversation."

If the restriction is - no marching in streets after dark, then let's consider:  They must be content neutral, which these are.  They must be narrow and still leave open other windows to speak, which these do.   And they must serve a serve a public interest, which these also do.   Do you contest this?"

Stuck between protestors and police, businesses and the people they serve. I think Schaaf is trying to earn back the trust of businesses while still allowing some outlet for the activist community. People aren't going to be happy in the interim."

If they do leave, there might be a considerable silver lining in terms of brining new businesses to Oakland and creating more housing.  From what the article says the economic impact of that kind of a development would be much more than what the 3 teams currently bring in.   Probably just a dream..."

They'd have to STRONGLY redevelop it though - like Mission Bay in SF but with waaay more retail and grocery areas. Also making the BART station feel less like a freaking prison when you get off it would help. Maybe a movie theatre/bowling alley or something too.  If they did that - with BART right by it (easy SF AND South Bay access) it would take off.   But it would require intelligence in the planning phase and I've seen little of that lately around here..."

Parking is not lacking in this neighborhood.  If the majority of parking for the building was for new retail, then the residential parking minimums would be below 1:1.

The majority will be for commuters - as I mentioned. That's a fact of life. Transit fucking sucks in the bay area - if I work in say... Union City or Sunnyvale and I want to get down there (and that SHOULD be easy) it'll take forever via public transit.  The bus system and BART is only useful if you work in Oakland, Berkeley or SF, outside of that it's pretty crap. Cars are still needed and so if they are to appeal to people they need parking.

But look, the point of lower parking minimums is to de-couple parking pricing from housing pricing. It's one-car households and no-car households who'll be interested in a building like this. And I'd argue that if people need more parking they can pay a monthly fee in a lot nearby. The money would, in theory, come from savings on their housing because parking is extremely expensive to design into buildings."
oakland,37nhln,abritinthebay,1 point,Sun May 31 05:22:38 2015 UTC,"Private shuttles like Google Buses? They're around. The Genetech bus picks up at Rockridge BART, Yahoo used to have one but I think they stopped it for some reason, and there are others.   It's one-car households and no-car households who'll be interested in a building like this.   In an area that is a short walk to 2 major BART stations and downtown..? You'd hope so, but honestly? I doubt it.   I'd argue that if people need more parking they can pay a monthly fee in a lot nearby.   Which is why they are building apartments and not you ;) Also taking up the city with crappy monthly parking lots is NOT an improvement over adding some more parking to a multi-story building.   The money would, in theory, come from savings on their housing because parking is extremely expensive to design into buildings.   That makes it sound like you've not rented an apartment ever... because that's not true at all. No parking never saves you money at all! Parking in building saves you money because it is less than at a monthly lot - but it doesn't save you on rent because the ones without parking don't charge less the ones with charge more for the parking (but less than a lot).  Also parking is trivial to design into buildings. It's one of the simplest things to design. Incredibly easy - much less complications than the apartments even!"
oakland,37nhln,joechoj,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:43:36 2015 UTC,"I see crappy monthly parking lots as a means of weaning ourselves off of a lifestyle where everyone has to own a car; so in the short term, I'm for them. They can always be demolished and replaced once we have more viable transit in place. By putting the excess parking outside apartment buildings, you maximize residential real estate, densifying the area and making it more suitable for expanded transit. If the excess parking is build into apartment buildings (with, what, 60-100yr lifespans?), it puts a cap on the density of the neighborhood. I'm not saying apartments don't need parking; they just don't need in excess of 0.75 parking : 1 dwelling. That's why I think this building should have 1:1 parking. About 300 parking spaces for 400 units, plus 100 spaces for retail.  I can't agree with you on parking construction costs. Check out this reference, for example. Including parking adds a huge amount of sq footage that a developer can't rent out as apartments; hence those costs have to be rolled into the apartments. I don't mean the design process itself is expensive; the resulting price structure is.  Basing price comparisons between parking and no-parking apartments on a real-world building misses the point: because it's already been built it's impossible to experience the rental savings that would have been achieved with less parking in the building. Yes, parking in a separate structure is more expensive than parking in the same one; because some building costs have been duplicated. But for the carless household it's far cheaper; not only are they not paying to park a car (either in the building or outside), but they're not paying to subsidize the space lost to parking in their building.  In my mind, being charged less is the same as not being charged more."
oakland,37nhln,abritinthebay,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"In my mind, being charged less is the same as not being charged more.   Sure, but my point is that you aren't being charged less. That was in fact... what I said.   I see crappy monthly parking lots as a means of weaning ourselves off of a lifestyle where everyone has to own a car    Which is fine, though woefully inefficient for many reasons, but without an actual alternative way to travel - which doesn't exist atm - all you end up doing is making things more expensive.  It's not practical, financially or physically, and it ignores the state of the city right now not how you'd like it to be.   I can't agree with you on parking construction costs.   I see what you mean. It's cheap to build (what I was saying) but expensive in terms of the alternatives they could be selling in the space it takes up (what you were saying). That's fair. We just had two different sticks ;)  However that sort of undermines your original point that there would be savings passed on. That might be true if we weren't in an epic state of housing scarcity and the market were saturated or at least close to that... but we're not. All that would happen (and I say this because it does currently happen) is that the apartments with parking would cost the same as the ones without but would make the parking spaces optional that you could rent.  Which is exactly what happens. So you save nothing if you don't have a car on the apartment vs someone that does. You end up not penalizing car owners much (because they NEED a car and you haven't given them an attractive alternative).  Or... as you so perfectly put it:   Basing price comparisons between parking and no-parking apartments on a real-world building misses the point...   Your point isn't based in the real world. Therefore it is fundamentally irrelevant right now. When your point becomes relevant to reality I'll agree - but we have to get there first."
oakland,37nhln,joechoj,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"You make some good points. I don't agree on the fundamental points, but it's an interesting exchange.   It's not practical, financially or physically, and it ignores the state of the city right now not how you'd like it to be.   But in this case, in order to create change, we have to build for the world we want to have. Otherwise we've set in stone (literally) a legacy of parking and automotive access that perpetuates our travel modes. I do think this is an area where wholesale revision of building codes is required to get developers on the same footing; if that can be done, low-parking buildings become more viable. I agree that in general improved transit has to accompany limitations on parking supply; but there's so much excess parking in this area that it's wasteful (and insensitive to Oakland's housing shortage) to incorporate it into the building. (And to be clear, yes, I'm making this argument from the viewpoint of what we should be moving toward; not necessarily what our building codes currently encourage.)   All that would happen is that the apartments with parking would cost the same as the ones without but would make the parking spaces optional that you could rent. Yes, exactly! That's a very powerful effect. I don't think I understand your objection that this wouldn't work. Are you saying that it wouldn't create enough price difference within the building? Or that it wouldn't save non-car users rent relative to a comparable building that incorporated parking for all?   all you end up doing is making things more expensive. ... for owners of cars only. For carless households, it's cheaper relative to car-using households; so you've successfully disincentivized car ownership. But again, you've also made their housing cheaper in absolute terms, because the developer can incur rental income from more units.   Maybe you're making the argument that the savings wouldn't actually be passed on by the developer, that they'd use it as an opportunity to simply recoup more return. Sure, let them test the market. And while that may be true, we'd never know. So much goes into the price of housing (location, marketing, construction quality, furnishings, etc.) that the distinction between 'increased price for car users' and 'decreased price for non-car users' loses meaning. Look, the point I'm making here is about de-coupling housing costs from transportation costs. We need to be moving in that direction, and I think we can do so affordably.  Here's a great excerpt from Shoup: ""Suppose cities required all fast-food restaurtns to include french fries with every hamburger. The fries would appear free, but they would have a high cost in money and health. Those who don’t eat the fries pay higher prices for their hamburgers but receive no benefit. Those who eat the fries they wouldn’t have ordered separately are also worse off, because they eat unhealthy food the wouldn’t otherwise buy. Even those who would order the fries if they weren’t included free are no better off, because the price of a hamburger would increase to cover the cost of the fries. How are minimum parking requirements different?"""

oakland,37nhln,abritinthebay,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:37:27 2015 UTC,"Indeed, and as he points out:   This might be true if one assumed that construction costs have little effect on local supply.   Right now - they don't. They will, eventually, but they really don't. The apartments easily make their minimums to break even and right now - as sucky as it is - parking makes those fill up even faster.  So it's an economic interest.  It won't be forever (as he points out actually) but it is right now."
oakland,37nhln,pathofwrath,2,Tue Jun 2 21:47:19 2015 UTC,Far too much parking. What is Oakland's minimum parking requirement these days?
oakland,37nhln,flutter-poppy,-2,Fri May 29 00:38:16 2015 UTC,600+ spaces is far from too much parking for 400+ units.
oakland,37nhln,heyitscory,5,Fri May 29 02:09:38 2015 UTC,1.5 spaces per unit will almost certainly be strained.  We have to pack in with a lot of room mates in this rental market.
oakland,37nhln,flutter-poppy,2,Fri May 29 04:07:43 2015 UTC,exactly... many adults live two to one bedroom and have two cars - not to mention the people sharing 2-3 bedrooms.
oakland,37nhln,pathofwrath,4,Fri May 29 05:33:09 2015 UTC,"If we want to continue to promote driving, then yes, we need to provide more parking.

oakland,37nhln,eugenesbluegenes,3,Fri May 29 16:41:58 2015 UTC,What a helpfully pedantic point you make.
oakland,37nhln,pathofwrath,2,Fri May 29 22:29:39 2015 UTC,"Given that the site is on a major transit corridor with frequent service, 1.5 spaces per unit is too much. That being said, and as I said previously, I don't know what Oakland's minimum parking requirements are. I would hope that for a project like this it's closer to 1:1 and that parking is unbundled."
oakland,37nhln,flutter-poppy,2,Fri May 29 04:25:10 2015 UTC,"They're not all residential units, I'm guessing it's 1 space per unit (common), and x spaces for retail units.  but in reality, 1.5 spaces per unit is not to much. In my old building, most neighbors had at least 1 car per adult and 2+ adults per unit."
oakland,37nhln,pathofwrath,3,Fri May 29 05:34:42 2015 UTC,"All 435 apartments are residential units. If Oakland has a 1:1 minimum parking requirement, I'd be surprised.  Obviously some of the parking will be for the ground floor retail. Again, I'm not sure what Oakland's minimum parking requirement is, so it's hard for me to say whether 600 spaces for 425 units + 24,000 sq ft of retail is justifiable.  I can say, as transportation planner, that the last thing we need to do is redevelop parcels to encourage more driving.  Broadway is a major transit corridor, with buses running every 12 minutes between Rockridge BART, all the way into Alameda and then Fruitvale BART. There is little reason for someone living on the Broadway corridor to need more than 1 parking space.  My wife and I lived in that neighborhood for several years. For most of that, we didn't own a car. I commuted to SF for school and she walked or transited to work in downtown Oakland."
