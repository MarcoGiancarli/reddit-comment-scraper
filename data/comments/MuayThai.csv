MuayThai,3e4s9i,lobf,6,Tue Jul 21 23:44:34 2015 UTC,Don't use your sparring gloves for bagwork or hard padwork. You will flatten the padding which makes it worse for your sparring partner. Buy another 16oz bag gloves for that.
MuayThai,3e4s9i,gorchitza,2,Wed Jul 22 01:44:44 2015 UTC,Idk about that....  This could be the case with shitty 16oz gloves but if OP has Twins or Windy thai gloves I really doubt this would happen to them (unless they are more than a year or two old maybe).

This will require you to step in and disrupt the kicking distance. I hope that helps!"

MuayThai,3dusbt,Carnestm,3,Mon Jul 20 00:05:22 2015 UTC,"Hi Dan, I saw this last week but here's my question. I would be interested in looking at the force of a single strike. It seems like this is more designed to calculate a number based on several strikes.   I could see this as a fun way to see who has the strongest kick, strongest punch, or for an individual to try variations of techniques to see which ones are more powerful, or even for students to regularly measure their power to see how it improves over time.  If it's able to give a number for a single strike, what is that number? Is it pounds of force or is it some raw number from the accelerometer?  It seems like the way it's advertised in the videos, how it gives you a number based on a round or two, is more designed as a fitness tool. That's great, but honestly not that interesting for me. For me, I'd love to see a way to measure the power of my strikes, one-at-a-time.  I've seen the ""Fight Science"" episode where several different martial artists compared their kicks to see who had the most powerful kick, but in addition to a sensor in the bag, they attached an accelerometer to the kicker's ankle to measure the speed of the foot. This seems more like the method used in the ""high striker"" carnival game."
MuayThai,3dusbt,P-Hoodie,3,Sun Jul 19 23:52:05 2015 UTC,"Hi and thanks for the questions!  You can look at individual strikes within the app.  The display on the bag right now will show the hardest strike in the round and overall in the workout, along with averages.  Sorry, if that's not clear.  I originally made this for me since I like to incorporate bag work into my exercise routine.  With that said, I did design this with a full workout in mind but telling which is the hardest is possible and currently in the code.    Hopefully that gives you the best of both worlds.  As for the number, you are correct we are using data from accelerometers that don't directly measure pounds of force...it's kind of like Nike Fuel points for us with our Impact Force number.  It'll be consistent for you and your bag so you can measure your progression.  We will continue to refine the algorithm with the goal of figuring out more metrics to provide, like reflex.  I watched the ESPN shows too and I wanted to stay away from adding more sensors to my body (or buying a new bag) and worked with engineers to develop what we have now.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions!  Thx!"
MuayThai,3dusbt,Jesus_H_Hitler,3,Mon Jul 20 00:19:08 2015 UTC,"Seems more suited for cardio kickboxing type classes, msrp seems a tad high though"
MuayThai,3dusbt,TotesMessenger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:56:28 2015 UTC,The original intention was to quantify a workout on a bag.  I've been doing martial arts for a couple of decades and I always thought it was a great workout to hit a bag.    It's not meant to be an aid in better technique per se - you need an instructor for that.  It'll tell you if you are hitting harder over time and show your overall effort.  Think of it as a smart treadmill for your bag.  We do envision this in a group setting as well.  Lots of folks like training together and this fits nicely with a competitive exercise model.  I think the msrp is reasonable given what you get with the product and the costs associated with the parts and manufacturing.   Hope that helps!  Thx!

But talking w a buddy who owns a company which develops products and works closely with distribution, a product line this would thrive in Dicks imo.  Best of luck"
MuayThai,3dusbt,THCanadian17,2,Mon Jul 20 04:00:29 2015 UTC,"Hey, Dan. This is a great idea. I do have a question about the metrics you are using. It says the Impact Force tells you how hard you are hitting over time... could you explain this or provide a little bit more insight as to how the information will be displayed in the app?  In all honesty I'm wary about what information I am actually getting from the wrap. I would like to be able to break down the rounds so I can compare, for example, how hard I am hitting at minute 1 and then again at minute 3... As a competitor this would be extremely valuable information. The pictures lead me to believe that it calculates an average for the whole round and that's it. Will I be able to break down my rounds?  Also out of curiosity is there any calibration that needs to be done when putting it on the bag? You say it will fit any bag but doesn't the weight of the bag play a part in the force generated? I'm not good with physics so I don't really know haha but if you could explain what you're measuring that would be great!  I apologize if this comes across as critical but I spent an hour or so looking for answers to this the other day and didn't find any... Thanks for the AMA!"
MuayThai,3dusbt,Sweetheart925,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:23 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Really appreciate the detailed questions.  Let me try to answer each:  METRICS Impact Force is our proprietary number that we are using to display after you hit the bag - kinda like Nike Fuel points.  We are using accelerometers that don't measure foot-lbs directly, which is the normal measurement for force.    The way we looked at is that as long as we have a consistent number over time, it wouldn't matter what the base measure, e.g. foot-lbs vs Impact Force.    ANALYSIS We will be able to breakdown the information that you are looking for through the app.  The display attached to the bag will have some basic information like max strike, averages by round or total, though, it could be more as we finalize the suppliers.    The app is designed to show all sorts of comparisons, including looking at strike by strike.  All that data will be captured and we'll continue to refine how it's displayed.  Hopefully, you'll be pretty happy with the resulting information!  CALIBRATION Right now, we don't have any calibration needed.  The number will be consistent for your bag.  The key is to make sure the sensors are tight against the bag, which happen naturally as you pull the top and bottom straps so the wrap doesn't move.  It took us a while to get that design.  Bags definitely have different mass and material.  It makes it very hard for us to normalize the data across all the possible bags out there.  Our solve has been to allow each bag to have it's own range.   If you'd like to compete, you either need to have the same bag as others - we are working on partnerships for this.  Or, it will be based on the same workout but competition will be based on percentage of improvement/performance rather than absolute numbers.  Hopefully, that answers your questions.  Sorry, it took you a bit to look through our material but you can hit my up directly dan@impactwrap.com with anything else.  Thx!"

In his defence, he transitioned very well for someone who never dealt with Thai clinch / low kicks."

I wonder what else he teaches?   Benny Urquidez is possibly the single biggest influence in American Kickboxing, which influenced Muay Thai in America, which also went into coaching MMA fighters. The fighters you see fighting today in UFC -- many of the champions have coaches that were directly inspired by Benny. He is certainly eligible to teach Muay Thai ;)"

At some point, you'll be able to endure training that will make the uninitiated think you are Superman.  In addition, at some point in the future you'll look at your performance now and be amazed at how much progress you'll have made.  It will have been on account of your effort and determination.  That's a he'll of a confidence builder right there.  You keep doing what you're doing and good luck."

Don't try, do. It's all about you.  MT doesn't care if you're fit or unfit, MT doesn't care if you're ugly or smelly.   We all have to train the same, and in the end, that's the reason we love it."

It's not exactly the same, but ""farang"" is often used the way we use the term ""tourist"". It can be simply descriptive, or it can be a put down. At the farther end of the spectrum farang can be seen as silly and incomprehensible by Thais."

MuayThai,3dlnp8,Chester_A_Arthritis,6,Fri Jul 17 16:15:20 2015 UTC,"There are lots of discordant things. Muay Thai is a JOB in Thailand, and it is low-level work. Most Thai fighters, and certainly trainers, would do something else if it paid better. Thai fighters aren't respected, they have short, sometimes physically debilitating careers, are left with no futures - Thais don't fight for the ""love"" of it. Westerners who come and train are by comparison incredibly wealthy. Why would a rich person come and PAY to do low-person work? There are all sorts of other things that don't compute, like the built in almost angry aggression and stiffness that most westerners have who want to fight, or the lack of hygiene (many are hippie backpackers) - can't tell you how many times a trainer complained to me about having to hold pads for someone who spit on him accidentally every time he threw a strike, which is a big insult in Thailand - or the fact that they can't learn very basic things that Thai children learn (because they are young)...lots of things don't make sense.   Of course there now are huge businesses in areas of Thailand that are farang only training centers and these are much more used to farang."

MuayThai,3djo7z,ThisWorksToo,4,Thu Jul 16 20:31:32 2015 UTC,"Most of these problems would probably go away if you were friends or at least friendly with the guys. Chit-chat a bit, get to know each other, become friends or at least friendly with them. That way the focus becomes helping each other out, not proving anything to anyone. People like to help others who are humble. If you come in all hot headed or insecure and over-compensating - those are the guys that people like to beat down. ALWAYS go light in class. If you go above 50% someone will likely get hurt and then they'll have to take time off. And hit as hard as you want to be hit (so go light). Some tips, use full body motion and proper technique when striking but don't contract/tense up your leg muscles when you kick, and don't tense up arm muscles or your fist when you strike. The speed should come mostly from your body movement so it'll be almost as fast as a full power strike, but keep everything relaxed so there's no weight behind it."

The other fighters will be encouraged to bring you up to their level so it can eventually be mutually beneficial. Most of the time when we spar it is around 35%. Sometimes we even go 15% to really get a nice technique flow going. When we have fighters ramping up to a fight we'll push up to 60% (maybe one week we'll do 80% for readiness/grit testing). Each week should be different. Just keep working hard to learn but don't overtrain.

MuayThai,3dh1sl,SilverThrone,2,Thu Jul 16 05:56:42 2015 UTC,Light sparring should be a good opportunity to experiment. Dont worry about getting hit too much since theoretically you shouldnt be injured from any shot. Instead work on executing. Do what you are going to do and dont let your partner completely dictate your actions.

Is your technique decent?  Its hard to discern what you're doing wrong since we can't see you, but are you throwing your strikes with awareness? That is, if you throw a single jab and you miss, do you realize that you are out of jab range and adjust your distance, or do you just continue on and throw strikes for the sake of throwing them?  If you're short, then you need to close distance off of your opponents strikes, that is stepping off the centerline of their attacks, inching forward until they are in your pocket. See Mike Zambidis in that case."

MuayThai,3ddnwz,PunPuncher,7,Wed Jul 15 13:29:51 2015 UTC,"Hey hey mate, Dutch practitioner of Muay Thai here. I'm not nearly as experienced as the majority of the guys here but I feel I can help you out here a little bit.   How much, on average, does the equipment cost? What sort of prices should I expect (for each piece of equiment) and what exactly do I need for beginner classes?   I bought a set of high quality shinguards and gloves from Rumble, this set me back about €150,- in total. I got my shorts as a gift from my gym by doing some stuff for them so I'm not sure how much they'll set you back.  My gym doesn't really care what you wear, we have members from all ages and some just wear a standard white shirt and sport shorts.   How many times should I choose to go every week, as to not overdo it while still slowly gaining experience? I guess this also depends on my preferences but I would also like to see recommendations.   I started with 2 times a week, Monday and Friday, this gave me plenty of rest while also making sure I wasn't getting out of shape.   What sort of injury risks are there, and what should I be careful for most of all?    In the beginning you shouldn't be to worried about this, yes your muscles will feel sore and you might get a couple of good bruises especially on your shins.  Worst ""injury"" for me so far has been a painful nose for a couple of days after walking into a uppercut during light sparring.   And finally, how does a typical class look like for a beginner level?   It depends on your gym, my gym tends to take newcomers of to the side for at least the first training to teach them how to correct throw a straight, hook, uppercut and kicks.  DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR GUIDANCE!  I can't stress this one enough, I've spend the first few sessions just trying to do the drills and not interfere with someone's else's training because I didn't want to be a hassle. Now I ask stuff on a daily basis. Mainly on how I should do my footwork to setup this or that kick/punch.  And enjoy yourself! Don't be ashamed if not being as experienced, you're there to learn. Not to be the baddest motherfucker in the gym.   Now I know that many of these things may vary depending on the place or other factors, but I would love to hear your experiences! Thank you!    If you have anymore questions feel free to ask them on here or over PM and goodluck!  USH!"

MuayThai,3ddnwz,gutterandstars,2,Wed Jul 15 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"u/Paars gave a great answer, but I'll drop my experience and opinion as well.   You shouldn't need anything for your first class or two. They'll have equipment you can use at the gym. As for buying your own, I would just get some basic 16oz gloves to start and shinguards. I like Combat Sports MMA-style shinguards because of the slide-on bit. There's a gear guide here that can give you an idea if you want to get into some top end stuff though. Expect to spend $100-$150 depending on what you like and want to invest up front. I like 3 times a week - it's enough to work on getting in shape without over-training and burning out. It also gives you the flexibility to do other workouts on other days. As long as you're warming up and stretching properly, and not trying to go balls-out all the time, you won't get injured. Few bruises, lots of soreness, but there's a difference between ""hurt"" and ""injured"". In my experience, you'll be pulled aside and taught the basics - how to throw your basic strikes, how to cover up, and footwork. Expect that for at least 1 full session. After that it depends on the mentality of the instructor(s) - you might end up being thrown in the deep end, or you might be slowly introduced into stuff. At any time if you feel like you're getting an information overload, don't EVER hesitate to ask for help. You don't want to form bad habits early. And don't expect to spar for at least a few weeks if you've never done any sparring-heavy martial arts before."

MuayThai,3ddnwz,TheGhostOfBillMarch,2,Wed Jul 15 19:34:57 2015 UTC,"Tabo gloves - EUR 25, Venum Shin guards - EUR 70, Gumshield - EUR 10, Everlast handwraps - EUR 10, Everlast skip rope - EUR 10...Total damage EUR 125...<< I bought these in Dubai so I've converted from AED to EUR...with taxes and general prices, maybe add another 25% to this figure? If you can do 3 classes, that's great...provides continuity and makes sure you're not too rusty the next week. I get time for 2 classes, so I exercise on my own over the weekend (Open mats as there are no classes then). Injury risk...? Little to maybe 0. Unless someone really wants to hurt you, it's difficult to get hurt without sparring. The trainer was showing some moves and swept me. Landed on one shoulder. Hurt for a few days but that's abt it. Rare case. I'm also at beginner level - 4 months in. Really heavy on cardio. It's essential as it shows how good/bad shape you're in as the benchmark. Helps you take control of your breathing. Once the trainer sees that you're picking up on it, s/he will probably try to bring in variations to push it a bit (e.g. moving around while skipping, on one leg, plyo pushups etc.).  It'll probably be 50% pure cardio and 50% on the bag (position, landing single punches, 2-3 move combos). G'luck and have fun!"
MuayThai,3ddnwz,TheGhostOfBillMarch,2,Wed Jul 15 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"Live in The Hague as well!   Where are you planning on going? If it's Buhsido Gym I'd strongly recommend to stay away from that place. They teach traditional MT there but in a way that's not conducive to your general well being and in the process you might learn a few techniques. The only place that teaches a more classical style is Keumgang (great school by the way).  That said, I've been involved in MT and boxing for a while again now so I'll help you out as well:   How much, on average, does the equipment cost? What sort of prices should I expect (for each piece of equiment) and what exactly do I need for beginner classes?   I would say roughly €100-150. Go to Force One Bangkok (Spui) and talk to the guys over there. They can help you out and will set you up with the basics (Joya is a really solid brand that doesn't break the bank, don't really need to buy Twins or Top King stuff yet IMO). Don't forget to buy 455cm wraps! As for wrapping itself, look around online, I like the thai style of wrapping and like this way, but look around and try.   How many times should I choose to go every week, as to not overdo it while still slowly gaining experience? I guess this also depends on my preferences but I would also like to see recommendations.   This strongly depends on you. First few sessions will likely be pretty taxing. I come from a boxing background and always kept my conditioning strong and I still felt wiped after the first few sessions. I like lifting and grappling too, so for me I find twice a week works out well with that.   What sort of injury risks are there, and what should I be careful for most of all?    Getting hit I suppose, but I have sustained a few minor hip injuries in the past when I do high or roundhouse kicks. I've had hip problems for forever though so that might just be me, definitely helps to be mobile though, so pay attention to that.   And finally, how does a typical class look like for a beginner level?   Depends on your gym. Unfortunately we don't offer lots of beginner classes here and you're basically thrown in with the rest of the attendees. This is good and bad, but ideally you should at least be shown how to do basic techniques by someone. Some gyms will just have you do full on low kick series when you don't even know how to fucking kick yet so that's not really a good thing."

The cardio you get from mountain biking is quite different to the conditioning needed for muay thai, I always run, about 50-60km per week and if I stay away from Muay Thai for a while when I come back I still feel out of shape! make sure the gym is good though, there are a few that teach some weird stuff hahah (I'm thinking of a video I saw a few weeks back of a guy punching students in the face in order to ""condition"" them or whatever the hell he was trying to do!) But usually the coaches are very humble and willing to help so there's not much to worry about there :) your technique will come with time so consistency is the key there! Since you have no experience you probably won't be sparring for a while, at least in my gym they require a certain number of classes before you can spar, for your safety as well as for the safety of others (make sure you can defend yourself and that you know what you're doing so that you don't hurt other unintentionally)! I'd say try making training partner friends, I personally am friends with most if not all the members of my gym, but I only train with a few of them, the ones that have a similar level and goal/mindset that I do which is to always improve and get better at Muay Thai rather than fitness-wise and whatnot, if you're starting it with a friend even better, you'll always have a training partner at the same level as you and it's always fun to advance together. I've personally found the best way to improve is to always stay connected with the sport, me and the friends I train with will always share videos with each other about certain techniques and fights and will always try out the things we saw and discussed online, so if you make friends there, try to stay in touch with them, you know maybe grab a few drinks and watch a fight together or something, makes the whole experience more enjoyable!  Sorry this was kinda long, I truly hope you have a good time though! Good Luck :)"
MuayThai,3dej31,lee-o,3,Wed Jul 15 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"If your gym has you sparring too early, look at other options. If your gym doesn't give a reasonable amount of focus on improving technique, look at other options.   For stretching, warm up first, then do dynamic stretching, then class, then finally static stretching. This is the proper order. Any other order will increase your risk of injury without any benefit. To gain the flexibility to kick higher, all you have to do is practice kicking higher.  To condition your shins, just kick the bag. When it doesn't hurt anymore, kick the bag harder. Rinse and repeat."
MuayThai,3dej31,HonkyMahFah,2,Wed Jul 15 21:19:38 2015 UTC,"Be patient.  Conditioning for Muay Thai at most gyms is intense, and you may feel discouraged by lack of cardio or lack of flexibility.  If you stick with it consistently you will notice improvement."
MuayThai,3dej31,Bro_Dude_Bro,2,Wed Jul 15 17:46:51 2015 UTC,"My flexibility has always sucked, so I'm definitely not looking forward to that part."
MuayThai,3dej31,Yomadafuku,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:48:50 2015 UTC,Take your time and work on technique instead of power. 90% of newbies at the gym just try to hit pads as hard as they can like retards. Then they will GAS and just slop around for the rest of the class. You will learn a lot faster and hit harder with proper technique. Also save your energy to get through the class with a fresh mindset. You will remember more aswell. Just take your time and work through the technique.   Having MMA at the gym will give you more stuff to learn for self defence/just general knowledge etc. A few of our boys do MMA at other gyms and its good to learn a few basic takedowns etc.
MuayThai,3dej31,mma_boxing_wrestling,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured I'd absorb some BJJ in the process. Hell, just being able to do a standing arm bar would be pretty useful."
MuayThai,3dej31,LostVoodoo,2,Thu Jul 16 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"Do your research into who's teaching the class. I know of MMA gyms where some guy with 4 or 5 pro MMA fights and 3 months of experience in Thailand runs it, and gyms where the instructor actually has years of high level competitive striking experience or was trained by someone who did. If the coach has no lineage or experience of his own, chances are you won't get great instruction.   You also want to check out as many gyms as possible. Credentials aren't everything. It's still important to get a feel for the atmosphere of the gym. Do the work to find the place that's best for you, then just show up ready to work hard and listen."
MuayThai,3dde8p,DonHeatrick,2,Wed Jul 15 11:51:17 2015 UTC,"Nothing happens by accident. If you want to be the best fighter you can be, you need to put some thought into it. Benjamin Franklin famously said, “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.” Or was it Winston Churchill? Anyway, whoever said it was bang on! And it’s true in every arena, Muay Thai included.  So what must you consider when planning your Muay Thai training and all its multifaceted aspects? What planning pitfalls must you avoid? Well here’s a quick breakdown for you, courtesy of sports science athletic training principles.  http://heatrick.com/2015/07/15/muay-thai-athletic-training-principles/"
MuayThai,3dgbis,saturdaysaver,6,Thu Jul 16 01:22:39 2015 UTC,"While BJJ is unquestionably an amazing martial art, being on the ground is terrible.  There can be concrete, rocks, and all sorts of material you may come into contact with and your opponent may have an easier time assaulting you with a knife.  This is to say there is One attacker, if there are more then unless you can completely incapacitate an opponent immediately, be prepared for soccer kicks, being pulled off, or being struck with a fist or another weapon.  BJJ is good in real world situations for anti-grappling.  To get the hell away from someone or break some hold so one can stand up.  I would contest that Judo is far superior to BJJ in this regard.  There's a reason there are wrestling pads everywhere, it's because being thrown outside on the ground can easily injure someone, and judo specializes in being able to throw larger opponents.  Notice in the video they were wrestling on the grass, imagine if that girl did that and the boy fell forward and the girl struck her head on the pavement, lights out.  Muay Thai isn't necessarily the best option for women's (or men's) defense.  A .38 snub nose is enough to take down even the largest and strongest of aggressors."
MuayThai,3dgbis,embrigh,0,Thu Jul 16 02:09:49 2015 UTC,"hey thanks for the feedback!   I totally agree that a gun is better. Im simply talking about as far as martial arts I would recommend for a woman who is interested in learning to defend herself. Honestly I think a years muay thai is just as useless for most woman in a multi assailant situation as a years bjj. Maybe she gets a couple of hits in, but thats a bad situation for anyone, regardless of gender.   The best defense to multiple assailants is a gun or run. Unless you are a crazy skilled boxer, you shouldent try and fight multiple people"
MuayThai,3dgbis,embrigh,3,Thu Jul 16 02:26:35 2015 UTC,"Actually I would argue that the best defense for multiple opponents would be a striking martial art like you mentioned boxing, and I think Muay Thai would be in that list.  Maybe not the grappling portion but removing that are still quite a few attacks that can easily incapacitate an unaware opponent.  Striking with the elbow for example is much safer than striking with a fist as hands are quite delicate and can easily fracture hitting something as hard as a skull.    I just think the author doesn't give credit where credit is due.  While wrestling is about skill, but it is also about weight.  In that video that girl is wrestling a male teenager of roughly the same build and height.  She submits him but not very ferociously like I've seen from a typical male wrestler in high school.  I'd wager that against a significantly larger attacker she might just become overpowered.    It would be simple to use MT skills to simply attack the neck or groin with immense force.  That and MT students do a lot of running.  EDIT:  Also the author disparages weapons for some unknown reason, I get that swordplay is useless if you don't carry around a sword, but a fencer with a real foil or epee could EASILY maim/kill someone.  I practiced in a fencing club for a few months and while I didn't get nearly as accurate as the regular, it would be trivially simple to drive a real epee straight through someone's body."
MuayThai,3dgbis,phliuy,3,Thu Jul 16 02:51:13 2015 UTC,"If you were carrying an epee around, and someone still tried to fight you, you have larger problems at hand.   For example, you are likely caught in some sort of fantasy movie"

MuayThai,3dgbis,meowthdat,5,Thu Jul 16 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"OP, I get that this is your personal blog, but your post is full of irrelevant context and fluff. Get to the point your trying to make, and then support it.  An obvious counterpoint to your idea that BJJ is better choice for a woman: why would a smaller, weaker person intentionally engage in a physical lock with a stronger person? (If it matters, I'm actually a purple belt as well).  The only way to actually use BJJ in self defense is to clinch, get taken down, or take the person down. This sounds like an incredibly stupid self defense strategy."
MuayThai,3dgbis,meowthdat,0,Thu Jul 16 03:24:23 2015 UTC,"ever heard of rape? Theres a reason im advocating bjj over wrestling or judo. When you are fighting someone who has 80 pounds on you, getting taken down is a foregone conclusion.   Also, I see why you think the first part is probably irrelevant, but in a good amount of my audience (particularly people who dont do combat sports) you do actually have to establish that men and women are physiologically different and why that is."
MuayThai,3dgbis,meowthdat,7,Thu Jul 16 03:27:30 2015 UTC,"I have heard of rape. Do you have some sort conclusive data, perhaps a pie graph of success rates of rapes against various styles of martial artists? No? Then how do you know anything of what you say is true, aside from massive conjecture and assumption?"
MuayThai,3dgbis,meowthdat,-4,Thu Jul 16 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"You absolutely do not, and thank you so much for your feedback. As I say on my blog, the views in my blog are mine, and you are under no obligation to agree with them. I am 23 years old, and I revise my views frequently, and there is no reason to believe that I will not have altered my views by the time I am 30, or 40. That said, im pretty sure about this.   I think bjj is the best option for a girl looking to not feel as though she is at the physical mercy of most men, who is also not looking to put a ton of time into obtaining this sense of security. I have explained why I think this in my blog. You are allowed to disagree."
MuayThai,3dgbis,meowthdat,3,Thu Jul 16 03:43:16 2015 UTC,"Cool, you seem pretty defensive and offended about having to defend your assumptions.   Like I mentioned, earlier, I am a purple belt in BJJ. I'm also 3-0 in full thai rules competition. I've been beat up in training and sparring by bigger people, and I'm under 150lbs so I know what its like to be crushed.  My final point is, this whole topic is pretty moot. Most people will not have to fight for their lives in some street altercation, ever. Some will, but for those who do, it could probably have been prevented by social awareness (disarming the situation) or by running away.  My advice? Train BJJ. Train muay thai. Train wrestling, judo. Do it to be healthy and because you enjoy it, not because you think it'll save your ass one day in your imaginary life and death rape situation. It might happen, but probably not."
MuayThai,3dgbis,DapperFisticuffs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:00:53 2015 UTC,"I think that you are approaching this from your own perspective, which is a fairly tough, athletic guy.   I think a lot of women don't have the luxury of getting not ""not worry"" about whether or not their training is preparing them for a real life situation. Most women, if they do encounter violence, are not going to be in a situation where they even have the room or the time to throw a roundhouse kick. Women are statistically much much more likely to be a victim of a sexual assault then an assault assault."
MuayThai,3dgbis,higherprimate718,2,Thu Jul 16 04:03:55 2015 UTC,"So are you using the term ""self defense"" which covers a broad spectrum of types of assault, or do you specifically mean ""self defense against sexual assault""?  Most women, if they do encounter violence, are not going to be in a situation where they even have the room or the time to throw a roundhouse kick.  - Again, says who? Conjecture and assumption on your behalf."

MuayThai,3dgbis,RidinTheMonster,2,Thu Jul 16 04:44:25 2015 UTC,"Do you train BJJ? Did it save you in your assault? Do you train any of muay thai, wrestling or judo? Do you know for certain that those trainings would not have helped you or saved you?  Quit taking it so personally. You're giving people advice which rightfully should be questioned.  I spent a month in NYC training at Marcelo Garcia's BJJ Academy as a blue belt. On my last day, at 5am on the way to catch the subway from Harlem to the bus station, a guy tried to rob me. He had his hand balled up in a black plastic bag, simulating a weapon (but he probably had nothing, hence the plastic bag covering his fist).  I didn't clinch him up, punch him or take him down. I made a scene by raising my arms AKA ""I surrender"" position so that anyone near by would see the confrontation, yelling for help, and then bolting across across the street. He didn't follow me after that.  Here's the thing, I don't make recommendations to others on should protect themselves or how they should handle the situation, because I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Every situation is different, every person is different. You seem to have all the answers though, which is why I guess I have a problem with your post."
MuayThai,3dgbis,sylviemuay,0,Thu Jul 16 05:01:51 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, you live in NYC? Me too. And to answer your questions, yes I I have been training jiu jitsu since I was 18. (I've never trained much gi so ive never been belted so im about a strong blue or a not so great purple). I've been doing muay thai on and off since I was 16 years old, and have spent time training in thailand, where I had some low level fights. I also have trained in boxing for various periods of time, at traditional gyms like gleasons.   Thats great that you have such a humble way of looking at your jiu jitsu journey. Personally, I don't look at it the same way. I have students who I coach, and who I feel very confident in instructing.   You can reject the answers I have all you want, its a free country. You shoulden't feel like you should limit your training to bjj because you are worried about being raped. Go train whatever stick fighting you want.   Edit: also, thank you for your feedback!"

MuayThai,3dgbis,angrynewyawka,9,Thu Jul 16 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, and at the end of the day, it's still just a person's opinion. Strict grappling does not prepare you for strikes while you're rolling. A violent confrontation period on cement is not where you want to be, and the BJJ rules are gone. As practitioners, we should all come to know that and leave the other crap behind us. A real self defense situation, just give the little fuck a wallet and leave with your life, then rolling on the ground with some dumb fuck who pulls out a weapon and the situation can be a lot worse.

MuayThai,3dc299,sylviemuay,11,Wed Jul 15 02:38:45 2015 UTC,"Martial arts are not growing in popularity.  Fitness and yoga is where the money is at, for prices that are the same or up to 50% higher sometimes.  I also looked into MT compared to other striking martial arts. Another one with Taekwondo   MT & Kickboxing still small. Kung Fu is flat, the spikes you see is because of movies like Kung Fu Panda. Taekwondo has taken a hit, not hot anymore. Karate is still the most popular kickboxing-ish style, the spike was because of the movie ""Karate Kid"" released in 2010. Boxing is still king and everyone has heard of it, the spike was Money Vs Pac fight.   Surprisingly, when it comes to searching for classes, kickboxing is far ahead."
MuayThai,3dc299,gorchitza,7,Wed Jul 15 07:06:21 2015 UTC,"With regards to kickboxing, particularly in the UK it is marketed as more of a fitness class in some gym chains - which explains its accessibility. Nothing wrong with that IMO, but it does differ from what most members here are used to."

MuayThai,3dc299,CptCoatrack,2,Wed Jul 15 17:59:53 2015 UTC,"Nice added research. This was something I was trying to get across, but I think you got it better. There are maybe two prongs to the Muay Thai fork: Muay Thai as entertainment, and Muay Thai as discipline. In general the Muay Thai as entertainment prong is dependent on the UFC and MMA. The Muay Thai as martial art discipline is linked to a general decline in martial art as self-improvement.  It is pretty amazing though how ""recession proof"" boxing has become. Great find.   Though Google's ""Topic"" feature is not something I completely trust as I'm not sure how widely, or in what way it groups searches. On the other hand the keyword ""boxing"" (which probably pulls ""kick boxing"" and other boxing searches) does show some slumping.  http://8limbs.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/boxing.png - hard to read. In any case, of all the sports, world wide, it still is going relatively strong."
MuayThai,3dc299,Kevin_von,7,Wed Jul 15 08:00:44 2015 UTC,"this doesn't surprise me  combat sports that get results are hard.  they are hard on the body, and since most people are lazy (50% of adults in the US are overweight and they ain't all ""big boned"") they never get past the ""ohhhhhhhhh it hurts""  once the lazy leave the gym, you'd think you'd be ok.  and you are - until the ones that are left realize that combat sports is an unending and relentless beatdown of the ego  you can lie to yourself about your abilities and flaws.  you can lie to others about your abilities and flaws.  but when you are trying and failing while sparring or drilling or whatever then you either have to do some impressive mental gymnastics to avoid facing your flaws.  but your training partner will know.  and the people watching will know.  and you, in your heart of hearts, will know.  i trained last night.  i did 12 rounds with a guy i've been coaching (kickboxing, not MT).  there was a time he couldn't touch me.  it lasted for at least 6 months.    that time is gone.  he kept working.  he figured out his strengths.  now i got to bring my A game.  last night, i did not bring my A game.  maybe, my C game.  but seeing as i had to talk myself into not saying ""let's stop"" at round 11, it was probably my D, E or F game.  you gotta be a particular type of person to put yourself thru that and KEEP putting yourself thru that.  i don't know what kind of person you have to be, but i know it is not common.  yeah, MMA might be getting a bump in popularity - but its the same bump that judo got in the 50s, karate got in the 60s, kung fu got in the 70s.  2 things will happen.  a watered down, easily accessible version of MMA training will develop so people can make money off the masses.  a smaller number of people will engage in the difficult and uncomfortable training i described."
MuayThai,3dc299,anon0108,6,Wed Jul 15 13:42:33 2015 UTC,"eh, another way of reading into it is that people don't really use the martial arts as a way to learn substantial self defense, but rather as a way to get fit."
MuayThai,3dc299,qwerty622,5,Wed Jul 15 15:51:30 2015 UTC,that's completely true.  and frankly there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  the problem is when people selling fitness related MA training market themselves as self defense/combat sports related MA training.

This is not a ""open 7 days a week"" gym where people show up when they want, they only had 2 classes a week so these students are the full class in a city of about 1 Mill   a watered down, easily accessible version of MMA training will develop so people can make money off the masses.

See the post about Thais and boxing. I think Americans at least want to see all out brawls
MuayThai,3dc299,Heavnsix,3,Wed Jul 15 03:56:54 2015 UTC,How does mma exist then? I consider muay thai a much more forceful martial art compared to karate or even boxing. I would never say its automatically more technical than either. Both are more popular than Muay Thai. Americans will always appreciate punching more than kicking. Boxing has a foothold in society. Even then Kicking in muay thai can be very brawl like. And the clinch does not help it in the west.   I like muay thai its super technical at the top but it will struggle in popularity for very obvious reasons.

MuayThai,3dc299,Kevin_von,3,Wed Jul 15 10:32:17 2015 UTC,"If you want to hurt someone, your first instinct is to punch him in the face. That's human instinct, hard wired. A kick in the face is flashy and has its own appeal, but it's foreign to the untrained, who have never thrown a head kick or felt one. It doesn't have that visceral connection with common people that a fistfight has.   That's my theory, anyway."
MuayThai,3dc299,bear-knuckle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:55:28 2015 UTC,"While I can see a sort of parallel Soccer is taking off huge in the USA.  So never isn't true. So I wouldnt put much into that. Its not kicking or using your legs its that boxing is perceived as better and in many ways it is. Also in the west, when few to none of the stars of a sport arent of their nationality its tough to make them fans. Like in soccer now we have world class players so its really ramping up. But muay thai even in the east isnt big business I dont forsee under traditional muay thai rules the sport ever getting big.   There are some major changes youd have to make in muay thai to get it popular in the west and that would kill a lot of the tradition in the sport for better or worse to get it big here. Glory is basically doing that with kickboxing over here same with its show time. Lion fight does a solid job and uses muay thai rules but It doesnt compete with the bigger dogs imo.   in short. for something so eastern with multiple competitors so large already that are westernized traditional muay thail will likely never take off in the west. Im sort of okay with that since IMO the meshing of karate, boxing, and muay thai sort of the best style imo. Where they all lack they compliment each other. I think in the end MMA tends to reveal what works best. I would like to see some muay thai/kickboxing with 4oz gloves. I like to see the defenses evolve past the big gloves."

Take your average muay thai pro and your average boxing pro and the head movement game by the boxer is leagues ahead of the muay thai fighter.  People have discussed it ad nauseum on here but the movement to and front punches in muay thai seems to be a lot less fluid which also happens to be part of the style in general. Its not a fluid style its a rough, violent, and forceful striking style.   Another reason their movement is hindered is that many muay thai fighters stand very high up.   But back to the point at hand. Influencing doesnt mean they have included most of western boxing. If they did Muay that would look a lot different. The emphasis is on the legs and elbows above hands and has been for a long time it would seem."

They aren't traditional thai stylists but I think they you're totally wrong about there being no advantage.  They arent mma fighters but I dont need to argue that even if I disagree with it.

The way he slips to throw his hooks especially is amazing. I see that as a huge advantage for him.
MuayThai,3dc299,caseharts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:08:39 2015 UTC,also they both tend to not have great defensive head movement but good offensive. I think using small gloves would help with forcing that. I sort of have a distaste for big gloves. But thats a seperate issue.
MuayThai,3dc299,caseharts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:12:03 2015 UTC,also as stated by others on here : punching is scored the lowest so guys dont get as good at it as usual which is a shame.

MuayThai,3de05u,themuaythaiguy,2,Wed Jul 15 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"Although I agree the drama most definitely brings in casual viewers. My thinking has always been that this stuff is completely fabricated. Even those pre-fight interviews where the guy goes ""I'm gonna knock him out"" I believe are scripted. But it worked. I wanted to see McGregor knocked out and that was by design. Also, I think the Aldo injury was staged and part of the original plan bc Aldo has a very good chance of stopping McGregor, but they needed to juice the McGregor story a bit more. Haven't read Pt 1 but the reason why I think MT isn't as popular as MMA is for the same reason why judo, karate, Taekwondo aren't popular. Those ""styles"" have artificial rules to funnel athletes into a ""style"" and the culture around it is very foreign for Americans (wai kru, shiny polyester shorts, all the accessories, etc.)"

MuayThai,3davtp,angrynewyawka,2,Wed Jul 15 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"They're pretty vague on how the tech works and how it calculates force. I'd be more interested in measuring a single strike than doing a whole round and coming up with a number based on number of strikes and force of each strike. Check out ""Fight Science Kick Test"" on YouTube, they did this but they had to attach an accelerometer to the kicking leg to measure the speed of the leg."

Edit: to answer your question, I don't know what type of gloves they sell but I doubt they'd be any good. I'd recommend going for a half decent pair (like the RDX's) for starting out and then upgrade to a pair of twins or similar."
MuayThai,3dcahh,WawaSC,2,Wed Jul 15 08:16:12 2015 UTC,"I've see walmart / dicks glove get shredded in a matter of months. Ringside.com carries Contender Fight Sports brand that's often on sale at a good price point.(I got muay thai gloves for $40 discounted from $80). Quality seems good, but they're the only pair of gloves I've owned. Some of the internal stitching is starting to come undone, but lasted more than a year. If you're new, they'll do just fine. You can upgrade later."
MuayThai,3dcahh,WawaSC,2,Wed Jul 15 09:40:17 2015 UTC,Hey. Im also in the market for gloves.  Where did you get your twins? Was hoping to get windy but if twins are that cheap i might just get twins.

MuayThai,3d7p4g,chomgroks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:17:40 2015 UTC,"I have an old one songchai tape that features a bunch of muay thai fighters who had success in boxing. Pretty much all of them still fought in the standard Thai style under MT rules. It might be possible to have a boxing focused style but there aren't many great muay thai fighters that have succeeded that way. Not to say there aren't plenty of Thais that have slick hands but they are usually strong with the kicking and clinching. The current trend in Thailand seems to be towards super heavy clinch fighters from what i've noticed, guys like Muangthai and Yodwicha."

MuayThai,3d7p4g,WawaSC,3,Tue Jul 14 14:53:06 2015 UTC,"Most boxers from thailand come from muay thai backgrounds. Samart is the most famous as he is considered one of greats in muay thai but also won a WBC boxing title. Somrak Khamsing is another muay thai legend who won an olympic gold medal in boxing. Khaosai Galaxy is a boxing great and comes from a muay thai background but wasn't a champ under thai rules. Other guys include Sirimongkol, Wanheng Menayothin, Amnat Ruenroeng and a bunch of other guys."

MuayThai,3d7p4g,djmattyd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but it looked like Abraham was really telegraphing his punches.   A few times I paused and backtracked a few seconds because I wanted to analyze Nattawut's head movement, but I also noticed that Abraham at times would pull his arm back too far to load his punches."
MuayThai,3d7p4g,dragon_engine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"Abraham isn't the best counterpoint because he commits his body weight to every punch. You can literally see his legs tense when he is about to throw, and he shifts body weight so much that he has to repeatedly catch himself in combinations. Nattawut sort of ""rides"" him in the punch combinations.   Mohamed Khamal is a good example of a guy who can throw tight combinations without losing his hip control. The kick and clinch method is a bit opportunistic in that it really comes alive when the opponent doesn't control his weight distribution."
MuayThai,3d7p4g,Masterandcomman,4,Fri Jul 17 08:11:00 2015 UTC,"Nevermind the hands, is anyone else impressed by Nattawut's kicks? I rarely remember seeing front roundhouse done so well: no telegraphing, from any angle, quick as you like and definitely powerful. Beautiful kicking, he goes from relaxed to powerful and back very quickly, not a single wasted movement."
MuayThai,3d7p4g,lardcore,2,Tue Jul 14 17:29:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I rewinded many parts of the fight watching his left roundhouse kick.  I myself have a hard time doing a clean switch kick, and I probably practice it less than I should be. Watching this fight gave me plenty of motivation to revisit that."
MuayThai,3d7p4g,dragon_engine,4,Wed Jul 15 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"In traditional Thai scoring, punches count the least, so seeing a Thai who's comfortable to just sit back kick a puncher isn't surprising at all. Also I've read that the technical fighter who backs up and counter attacks vs an aggressive puncher who's always Persueing is more favored in Thailand. I haven't seen a lot of nuttawat, so I can't really comment on his style but I'm willing to bet that's how he's comfortable fighting."

MuayThai,3d9gmv,alex617,9,Tue Jul 14 15:23:34 2015 UTC,Injury for 6mo =/= permanent injury. Sometimes shit can take a long time to heal. Welcome to growing older.
MuayThai,3d9gmv,djmattyd,4,Tue Jul 14 19:20:18 2015 UTC,What kind of scans x-Ray or MRI? X-rays will only tell you if a bone is broken but you'd probably need an MRI to find any ligament damage. I had one on my knee when I tore my ACL but they take about an hour of scanning and costs around $700-$1200 usually. And maybe go see a chiropractor to help with the pain
MuayThai,3d9gmv,JorgFink,2,Tue Jul 14 17:14:13 2015 UTC,"+1  Get an MRI, without that you just don't know whats actually going on in there."
MuayThai,3d9gmv,cerebral_mindset,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"Med student here. If those scans were an MRI and nothing significant was found, work on stretching your neck muscles as best you can. Specifically, sit with your legs together and reach to your toes, and let your neck hang and relax. Hold the position until you you feel the muscle release, and then do it with different angles. This can loosen up chronically tight fascia.  But the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to rule out anything serious, and he/she can advise you on safe stretches and exercises that may help."
MuayThai,3d9gmv,Fishbelly32,5,Tue Jul 14 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"And we're back to guys asking the internet for help with serious medical issues, rather than getting an alternative professional opinion..."

MuayThai,3d9gmv,one2one2v2,0,Sun Jul 19 03:09:56 2015 UTC,Yes because telhe internet is useless for getting advice from people who experienced the same issues as you right?
MuayThai,3d9gmv,Athrul,7,Wed Jul 15 03:36:07 2015 UTC,"When it comes to advice about stuff like medical issues, yes. Precisely.  Sometimes you have luck and get someone who actually knows his stuff, but often it's just hearsay, actually something different that just sounded similar to the guy, or plain wrong. And you have no way of verifying it.  A real professional has studied this stuff for years and has actual experience across cases."
MuayThai,3d9gmv,gorchitza,-5,Wed Jul 15 04:50:46 2015 UTC,"I rather get hearsay than nothing at all, especially from people who are doing something the same as me. If I choose to take the advice at face value that's my problem, however only relying on doctors for informed opinion has been shown to be detrimental time and time again. This coming from a premedical student."
MuayThai,3d9gmv,Athrul,2,Wed Jul 15 05:48:02 2015 UTC,"It is always wise to get a second opinion with doctors, I also found stretching to help, perhaps google neck exercises to increase it's strength.  My right knee ACL and left elbow / shoulder / metacarpals and lower back need surgery to repair. Muscle problems can be helped with warming up and stretching, tendon and nerve problems are a different beast IMO  Sometimes it feels like I am sacrificing physical health for mental health."
MuayThai,3d9gmv,gorchitza,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"Stretching and strength training while the injury is still there and while he's not really sure what it actually is seems like a really, really, really bad idea."

Other people in my gym also like these gloves, or use Windy or Raja gloves that look like the fairtex bag gloves you linked.  I disagree with the other posters. Bag gloves are what you want for training. 14 or 16oz gloves are mainly for sparring."
MuayThai,3d6nnz,mtgifs,-2,Wed Jul 15 19:47:07 2015 UTC,I would clarify that and say that these gloves are necessary after a few months if you want to condition your wrists/knuckles.
MuayThai,3d6nnz,angrynewyawka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"These are very small...how do they compare to the gloves you normally use in class?  I train with 14oz boxing gloves (female), most of the guys at my gym train with 16oz."
MuayThai,3d6nnz,imawitchbitch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:29:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point in using these type of oldschool bag gloves. They offer little wrist protection and look like 6 to 8 oz of padding at the most. Sure it ""feels"" good when you hit with them because you can feel your power, but you will get used to the lightness and speed, which you will make you sluggish with 16 oz sparring or 10 oz competition gloves.  Personally I use 16 oz gloves for bag, if you really insist on something like this I recommend these type of MMA gloves. You get the same amount of padding, a bit more in wrist support (I own this exact glove and they have very long velcro wrist wraps), and an added bonus is no protection on the fingers so your hooks have to be crisp."

MuayThai,3d40xy,usfdude223,4,Mon Jul 13 10:57:09 2015 UTC,"Nook at Lanna is really amazing. I think he learned injury massage by being massaged, not only as a fighter, but he also had a terrible motorcycle accident which completely wrecked his knee and leaves him in daily pain even now. He's taken care of Lanna fighters so long now, and been massaged so much for his own injuries, he seems to have a very practical, instinctive understanding of the body and it's injuries.   The most amazing thing about it may be that he doesn't charge. He sees that you are in pain, need fixing, and he just goes to work, like on a fence that needs mending."
MuayThai,3d40xy,usfdude223,2,Mon Jul 13 11:11:05 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that from a lot of the trainers I've had as well.  They've suffered the same pains, they know what needs to be fixed and they just do it.  5 minutes of their time can mean a great fighter and a loyal return private lesson! :)"

Keen up the great work, it is amazing that people like Nook just go to work where it needs to be done.  Do you have any videos of Nook and his padwork? What's unusual about it?"
MuayThai,3d40xy,HotSoup_77,3,Tue Jul 14 10:58:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the good words. Nook is incredibly strong, can mash pads with guys much bigger than him, but what he does is pull the pad when you don't expect it, and counter whack you. He does it again and again and laughs every time. Basically he is forcing you to not over commit, and to stay on balance, maintain defensive integrity. But he suckers you in. Guys get very frustrated with him and tend to not understand what's happening.   Also, separately, if things get heated, and they can after a dude gets his head whacked a few times, and you look him in the eye you get pure fight energy from him. He just turns fighter, from his old days and the eyes go dark, and he'll pretty much will bring it to you with the pads. You can't really challenge him without things escalating. You would think that people would stay respectful, but the way he holds pads people get out of focus and feel challenged.  He also frustrates because he's made of stone, and when he puts up his knee and shin to block kicks, when things become a little freestyle, there is like nowhere to actually kick. Hard to explain.   He's a unique man and padholder. He also is probably the best teacher of muay thai to kids I've ever seen. I don't think I have video of him though, I'll look."
MuayThai,3czwdk,turknado,3,Sun Jul 12 08:13:10 2015 UTC,Stick with the muay thai  class. No need to over exert yourself . It takes time. You aren't training for a fight.
MuayThai,3czwdk,Wafflefodder,3,Sun Jul 12 10:14:57 2015 UTC,You can add running once you stop gassing or sore everywhere. I hate running and I still keep it up. Get some Namman Muay and rub that in.
MuayThai,3czwdk,DapperFisticuffs,3,Sun Jul 12 15:33:42 2015 UTC,"I think you could mix up the boxing or Muay Thai - I don't see any harm in it, but you'll have to adjust a few things but it's not hard to get used to it. I think the most important things to do outside of the gym is to increase your flexibility (whole body) and shadow-box. The flexibility increases your speed, power, ""pop,"" minimizes telegraphing, strikes require less effort, muscles become more efficient. Shadow boxing gives you an opportunity to focus 100% on technique and not about smashing a pad or heavy bag. It also teaches you how to relax when you strike. Every technique is about synchronizing your strike with the rest of your body (feet, hips, shoulders, hands, back, etc.). Sleep/rest is super important. Running is great too, but I'd do the other three things first. Just my 2c."
MuayThai,3czwdk,JorgFink,2,Tue Jul 14 09:13:25 2015 UTC,"Your muscles take ~36 hours to fully recover from exercise. After class, there is no harm in doing as many pushups, situps, and jump squats as you can. Then just wait until next class and do it all over again."

I went to my 2nd class and asked my kru about exercises outside of Muay Thai I could do to build up more stamina/strength and he told me that running is great but the only way to get better at Muay Thai workouts is by doing Muay Thai workouts. A month later I can now do other exercises such as lifting or running cause my body got used to the killer workouts in Muay Thai. My body doesn't get as sore anymore. My advice is keep doing Muay Thai and everything will fall into place.

MuayThai,3cu4ml,banana_lumpia,3,Sat Jul 11 04:55:00 2015 UTC,"Hi mate, I answered a similar question on the Facebook page yesterday - As we're training aerobically for central adaptations, rather than peripheral adaptations, our cardiovascular system doesn't really recognise the difference in the method we use to reach the desired heart rates i.e. 120-150bpm.   Therefore, it's acceptable to use a range of aerobic training methods such as cycling, skipping, rhythmic (slow) muay Thai technical work, use the rowing machine, it's really up to you how you achieve it."

MuayThai,3cu4ml,FxDeltaD,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:58:16 2015 UTC,There were similar findings in a 2002 case study involving triathletes.
MuayThai,3cu4ml,FxDeltaD,2,Sat Jul 11 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"I don't have access to those studies you cited mate so I can't comment much. But if you're looking at subjects who have just ran for 6-8 weeks and then switch to swimming or cycling or vica versa, then you have to take the peripheral adaptations into consideration too.   So if you perform one type of training for several weeks, your muscles and vascular system will have adapted somewhat to that type of training. If you then test Vo2max in another sport which hasn't been trained then the peripheral factors will inhibit performance.   However, we're not just running, or just cycling, we're training muay Thai throughout the program and gaining peripheral adaptations from all methods of training, including muay Thai, so we'd have no problem utilising those increases in Vo2max in our sport.  Again, without seeing the full studies it's hard to answer."

MuayThai,3cuj1e,castle138,2,Fri Jul 10 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"Great article and thoughts. There is also a historical connection between ballet and fighting that may support your observations. Ballet originally developed in a time when noble men (because ballet was originally for men) were expected to show competence/mastery of three physical arts: dance, riding, and fencing.  The aesthetics of the three were all connected by the idea of sprezzatura, or nonchalance. To relate back to your article: at the time of ballet's birth, the main way that dancing and (sword)fighting were judged was the ability to make the very difficult appear effortless.  As a quick sidenote, this article needs some copy editing. For instance:   You here it in that world all of the time, “she has beautiful feet.”   ""here"" should be ""hear""   In the world of ballet, you often hear ""she has beautiful feet."""

MuayThai,3cti3f,Manzanis,3,Fri Jul 10 17:25:32 2015 UTC,"Usually its a combination of 2 factors for newbies.   Not enough high intensity cardio.  You can run for miles but can't exert yourself for more than a few seconds at a time without dying.  Look up some HIIT exercisizes to do.   Cardio management.  New guys are too tense during sparring and pad work.  They waste needless energy when they are doing nothing.  Overreacting to every little movement, holding their breath, tension in the whole body are typical signs of bad cardio management.  This is a bit tougher to develop as it takes some time to recognize when you are safe in sparring.  But this applies in pad work as well. A relaxed muscle is one that you can flex, staying relaxed increases speed and power in your strikes.     You asked treadmill or technique?  the answer is both."

MuayThai,3cti3f,FSUser,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"Lots of people tend to forget that caffeine is an actual drug. In my experience, it disrupts focus in a lot of fighters. People usually take big doses of caffeine to ""get through"" a workout, but it often does the opposite: it affects willpower and focus, and although it may provide some physical augmentation, that's often in opposition to its psychological effects.  Also, more philosophically, if you have to take a drug just to ""get through"" a typical day of training, what's your fight day going to be like? Your energy levels should already be high because you're about to practice your hobby. If they're so low you worry you can't train, have you tried sleeping more?  And if you are sleeping, are you training your passion as well as your body? One of the biggest stumbling blocks for any new trainee is learning to love all of the hellish things we put our body through. Why are you training? What do you want to achieve? One of my favorite gyms ever, a tiny hole in the wall that wasn't open very long, had one of my favorite signs of all time over the door:  We all dream different  But we all dream here.  It helped remind everyone why they're doing what they're doing and what motivates them to work hard. I always take 30 or 60 seconds before every session thinking about what I want to achieve and why I'm there that day. It helps a lot."

Logically, I know there's a great value to it, but that doesn't mean my heart is in it when we're doing the shitty parts. It's just another obstacle to overcome."

Wear a shin guard on that shin at all times during training. If something hurts, don't do it. Take this time to work on your weaknesses.

I go through what you're going through every damn fight I have despite how well my shins are conditioned. With the theraband (takes about 3 days of usage) and ointments it takes about a week and a half to be 100%  Everyone who's trained Thai for some time experienced what you're going through now. Never come across anyone who has damaged their Tibia.  If you've been jogging for a while or if you walk a lot you're tibia would be pretty well condition.

My best friend and I bought these exact same ones and we had to get rid of them because they're literally just padded socks.    Invest in some good shin guards if you're worried about hurting your legs.  Otherwise, if you're trying to do this long term and you're not sparring (light or heavy sparring) I wouldn't use the shin guards at all when hitting pads and the bag in order to condition your legs.  When I first started MT, I couldn't kick a Thai bag for more than a round before my shin was destroyed and tender.  After time though, it gets better and better to the point where kicking boxing bags full force will never make you hurt again."
MuayThai,3crjwu,Athrul,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"I'd stick to the chart. Measure from your ankle and not from the sole, i.e. only the actual shin. The most important thing about shinguard sizing in my experience is that they have the right length. They shouldn't go over the knee unless they have a knee protection. I've only seen shinguards with integrated knee pad once and it looked uncomfortable and as if the pad would slide. That being said, I have next to no experience with those sleeve guards that you put on like socks. But I don't think that your calf size matters that much, otherwise that would be an extra measurement in the chart.  What do you want to use them for. Those cloth guards are competition material. They don't give you a whole lot of padding. Going bone on bone with some intensity can really hurt through those. If you want something for sparring, I'd go with regular leather guards like this one."

I'm very much a casual so I don't think I'll be progressing fast haha. The ones the trainer has me using are cloth/sock-like like this, which is why I chose it.   I followed the picture in the sizing chart for what to measure, but I don't have a measuring tape so it's a rough estimate. ~11in, borderline x-small. I'm just worried if I get the x-small it'll be too short, and if being a little too long is okay I'd rather go with the next size.."
MuayThai,3crjwu,PeacefulSequoia,2,Fri Jul 10 08:00:02 2015 UTC,Why would you want to wear shin guards for bag work? One of the reasons for bag work is to condition your shins.

Not huge bruising or anything, but especially in those circumstances you can tell I've been repeatedly kicking something ;)  The only way to kick comfortably and without overstimulated pain receptors taking away some of the fun in training, is to condition your shins/legs in general.  Then they get used to it and there will be no pain after training any more, pretty much goes for bruising as well.  Good luck and have fun!"

Any size advantage you could gain will probably be cancelled out by the negative effects of the weight cut. Often in first fights, you both gas out, and the fitter person wins. lose as much weight as possible in the weeks before in a healthy way by managing your diet and portion sizes. You don't want to have to starve/dehydrate yourself the day of the fight. You won't be able to fully recover on time and dehydration also makes you more susceptible to brain damage."

MuayThai,3cph0b,Remi_The_master,12,Thu Jul 9 19:39:25 2015 UTC,Show me a pro at 2% BF. They don't exist. Most high level leaned out guys are 6-7% still.   OP - for day-of weigh ins and for your first fight I wouldn't water/ food cut any more than 5-7lbs at your weight. So realistically you can probably get a bit leaner (maybe down to 160lbs) just by training really hard and eating clean. This means you can probably fight at 154lbs with a small weight cut.

Unless you're planning on going pro yourself, modelling yourself and your behaviour after professional athletes (particularly in this case) is a bad idea. They're putting their bodies through hell and sacrificing their long-term health to be the best at what they do in their 20's and 30's. The amount of weight you can cut for a fight is very specific to your body, and it's really easy to lose a significant amount of strength and stamina by cutting too much. For your first, amateur fight, you should be cutting a few pounds at most, assuming you're in shape already (which you are). If you feel fine before, during and after the cut, maybe try cutting more next time.

MuayThai,3cpo56,Machitis68,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:25:53 2015 UTC,I've actually seen gloves that you can use that act as hand wraps. It takes me a little bit to get on my wraps too so I was thinking of investing in them. The aim is to protect the wrist and the knuckles. These do it pretty effectively IMO. Something like this: http://www.sportsdirect.com/adidas-super-inner-gloves-762494?colcode=76249446 . you can get them on and off pretty quick. Hope it helps!

You don't need to wrap all the way around the knuckles which is the part I would imagine slides off. Before I sound too stupid, this video shows the method i'm talking about and it locks everything in very securely. If they are coming undone at the velcro, there isn't much you can do there besides wider velcro."
MuayThai,3cpo56,bear-knuckle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:23:43 2015 UTC,"The easiest thing to do is apply some strips of tape to the weak bits of the wrap. Most wraps are held together mostly by one point of security (Velcro usually), so by adding a few more fastening points you get more stability."

MuayThai,3cpo56,kevinichi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:19:34 2015 UTC,pretty similar to this: http://www.wikihow.com/Wrap-Your-Hands-for-Boxing  there are some minor differences:  i put the loop on my thumb and take the wrap across my palm over to the pinky side of my hand then across the back of my hand to the base of my thumb before wrapping it around my wrist.  i also thread the wrap between my pinky finger and ring finger and work my way to my thumb.  how do you wrap yours?
MuayThai,3cpo56,kevinichi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:29:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty similar to how that wiki does it. I put the loop on my thumb, wrap the back of my hand, then my wrist a few times, then I loop from the base of my thumb through each of of my fingers starting with the space between my pinky and ring. Then I just sort of wrap it normally around my knuckles and my wrist a bit more.  I guess the only real thing I do differently is that I don't wrap my thumb."

However, this is pretty standard in Thailand and it's often crazy to see how the Thai can manage such conditions. (Even though they dont sweat as much as europeans (me)-  I'd always need a towel to dry the mat every 2-3minutes, like many farang but the Thai seem like they couldn't care less. If I didnt use the towel, I'd look like a complete fool, semi-slipping during power kicks on heavy bag, sometimes ending up completely out of balance thus breaking posture as if it was my first day kicking a bag.  Mind you, this is after a while there so I'm pretty much as accustomed to the heat as I'll ever get and the amount of sweat I produce is still insane. Drinking 3litres of liquid for 2hrs of training was pretty common among farang to give you an idea :)  Edit: this is during April/May/Jun, the hottest months there"

MuayThai,3cjvka,gorchitza,2,Thu Jul 9 01:27:53 2015 UTC,"I agree fully with one of your points being, we don't know anything about these fighters. I would consider myself a modest MT fan, I watch stadium fights pretty regularly and I always look forward to the glory cards but I'd still be hard pressed to tell you much about any fighter, Even the big ones.   IMO UFC did something crazy and revolutionary with their first season of their reality show. Up until that point MMA was still considered a spectacle at best, no sports channel would even consider covering it and I doubt anyone would consider it an actual sport. I don't know if any of you guys remembered that first season but damn it really opened my eyes to the fighting world in general. All of a sudden you saw first hand the grueling training that these athletes go through and the biggest part i think, it showed the human side of the sport. These guys weren't just crazy freaks who wanna rip each other apart anymore. These were people with legitimate doubts and fears of fighting just like all of us. I still remember one epd where everyone was refusing to fight and Dana had to personally come to the gym and tell these guys to man the fuck up. So when Griffen and Bonner put their fears, doubts and bodies on the line for the final fight you couldn't help but get invested, it really became rocky movie in real life.   Now I don't know if a reality show is the answer at this stage of the game, the mystery of combat athletes is all but out in the open at this point. But I still think it would be a big boost for an organization like Glory to do something similar. An all access epd with a few of their fighters and really get to know who they are. As it stands right now, a lot of these fighters are really just nameless faces and most of the information about these fighters I have to actively go out and dig up. That's not going to help the casual fan who just stumbled upon a random glory card while flipping channels."
MuayThai,3cjvka,ofizzle,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:35:09 2015 UTC,Lol. Ive converted at least 15 people to becoming fans of muay thai by just randomly tapping shit with my shin in public.   ive gotten a lot of people into MT. We go to the bars together and get into bar fights all the time.  shit is cash.
MuayThai,3cmkvv,dragon_engine,3,Thu Jul 9 02:02:44 2015 UTC,"another good option instead of the ones you listed is to plant the lead leg heavily and come in with a strong straight punch. (which doesnt help you question but i figured id throw it out there). Personally, id say that reading the attacks better will come with time(in a fight as the rounds progress, and in time as you continue to progress in experience).  Raising your knee really high leaves you a little vulnerable but in my opinion try it out and see what feels comfortable for you. if you find youre protecting your head and trying to check with your leg for the mid kicks , if you feel one slip through, try and react fast enough to catch if after it hits you, in my opinion that has always been a good way of being able to deter more mid kicks. hope i could help at least a little bit."
MuayThai,3cmkvv,muaythaiislife,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:51:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  I actually end up ""catching"" those mid-kicks, but in a weird way. I'll pin the other person's foot with my elbow against my raised knee, but all that does is their foot is trapped in a crappy clamp, and I'm standing there trying to balance on one foot while trying to hold onto their foot.  I'll give that a try next time, and try to grab the leg as I drop my knee, then go for the sweep."
MuayThai,3cmkvv,angrynewyawka,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"Three things:  1) What our friend described above is called ""baiting"".  You see Saenchai do that shit a lot to get people to low kick him so he can land a straight down the pipe, or swoop around and sweep people with a sharp kick to the achilles.  Great strat, however, it's not really a check at all.  I like to use that with taller guys and guys who are generally faster than me so I can level the playing field.  2) If you're catching a right body kick (your left side) try to go with it a little to break the impact a little.  Then, try giving the guy a sharp, quick and hard pull towards you to put them off balance and follow up with a counter.  Works almost every time unless the guy is advanced and knows what he's doing.  3) I had your same problem and what proved best for me was to incorporate 2 round of ""Shadow-blocking"". Where I just check, check and check for 2 rounds straight while maintaining proper form.  It sounds dumb, but it will get you into the habit of raising your knee to the correct height."
MuayThai,3cmkvv,qwortec,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"I'll try to include more checks into my shadow-boxing. I know I'm supposed to touch my knee with my elbow as I block, but I'm probably not doing it fully enough during sparring. Thanks for the pointers."
MuayThai,3cmkvv,one2one2v2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"My favorite way to check the inside lead leg kick has always been to knee spike. Don't lift you lead leg, just pivot it in and raise up on the ball of your foot while bending your knee in toward the kicking leg's line of attack. It hurts like he'll to get checked like that and it is a really quick reaction."
MuayThai,3cjch2,hen_zee,5,Wed Jul 8 10:46:49 2015 UTC,"It's a decent training tool if others fail, but I generally don't like this type of thing. Especially because it holds the arms way down and out of a normal guard position, so there's still the puzzle of how to go from peekaboo to chambered body shot or uppercut without telegraphing. In my experience, it's way easier to teach the hip motion without any arm motion at all (e.g., rotating the hips in a good stance with hands on the hips or loose by the sides) and then adding the arms once the leg and body motion is mastered."
MuayThai,3cjch2,Stewthulhu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:34:37 2015 UTC,I don't imagine this technique being used for anything more than an intro training.  Nobody is insinuating that this is a long term tool that should be done daily.    When I was first learning kicking we had to put our hands across our chests on our shoulders so we would focus on our legs and hips and not the swing of our arms.  Would you bash the trainer because he didn't teach how to guard?

MuayThai,3ci6ev,sylviemuay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:33:37 2015 UTC,"Great article, it is very interesting to read about the differences in perception between westerners and Thais, particularly for people who have aspirations to go to Thailand to fight.   Curious about this part, however;   But this is a profound problem for Muay Thai itself because Thai scoring is what makes Muay Thai what it is, and if the Muay of Thailand is going to proliferate in the west, then so too must important aspects of its scoring   How do you see this kind of thought/perception spreading?  I think it is going to be an uphill battle. Most people who train Muay Thai in the West are not interested in fighting, and so you really only have the small percentage of westerners who fight who will have any kind of appreciation for Thai-style scoring. At my gym, there are probably 120 or so people who train on a regular basis across all the classes, ranging from beginners to fighters. Only about 20 fight, and even out of that group, I would not say they are all fully cognisant of the scoring in traditional Muay Thai.  Then you have the western general public. You only have to look as far as Mayweather vs Pacquiao to see how scoring of any kind is lost on the vast majority of them. Even most Western fight fans take a ""JUST BLEED"" mentality, and are happy to award fights to guys throwing wild haymakers all day.   I think it will require more guys like Yod and Buakaw to take fights outside of Thailand, win, and get people interested in this style of fighting. Then it will be up to the western gyms to better educate All of their students in the style/spirit of Muay Thai.   edit-spelling."
MuayThai,3ci6ev,weltesser,3,Wed Jul 8 09:33:12 2015 UTC,"I think it really comes down to educating judges. If judging reflects Thai principles regularly then there will be a trickle down effect. People do what it takes to win. Tony Myers, for instance mentioned in the article, has worked really tirelessly to improve judging and gym perception in the UK, and he seems to feel that it has changed tremendously.  I do agree thought that Thai fighters themselves can be great ambassadors, but unfortunately they often find themselves fighting under non-Muay Thai rules internationally, or in productions that don't score with Muay Thai principles."

Pretty green westerners are getting fights there now, admittedly early ones, is this just to try and profit from them? ie scoring them differently to keep them and supporters happy?"
MuayThai,3ci6ev,ICEFARMER,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:21:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know about how those early-bird farang fights are scored, I suspect that that isn't very important to Thais, but yes, I've heard that New Lumpinee is scoring differently than Old Lumpinee. I've heard this from Pi Nu who is my head trainer and who brings lots of boys to Lumpinee, and has for a long time. The word seems to be that Old Lumpinee used to let you fight backwards for much more of the fight, you could win just by countering and retreating, but that now you have to establish a little more dominance in exchanges. For instance Sam A lost a fight at New Lumpinee and Pi Nu told me that he would have won at Old Lumpinee. But every stadium has had slightly different scoring tendencies, producing different kinds of fights. Lumpinee might be trying to make their fights a little more dynamic now, not sure."
MuayThai,3ci6ev,ICEFARMER,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:42:45 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, when it comes to fighting sports the biggest problem I see is either uneducated fans or fans who just want brawls.  Be it muay thai, boxing, mma, etc the consisent issue is that people love to see activity and this effects judging as well.  People often talk about stealing rounds by being really active in the closing seconds.    A great boxing example that comes to mind is Whitaker vs De La Hoya.  In at the end of a round Oscar was throwing combinations like crazy and Pernell blocked or slipped all of the shots the proceeded to make fun of De La Hoya by doing a Muhammad Ali style ""I'm injured"" gag on his way back to the corner.  Oscar went on to win the fight but the reaction to him swinging away by people who watched the fight is quite strong.  Most people's immediate response is that Oscar was killing him.  Watch it again and nothing really landed but his hands were active.  Here is is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgmGRrc5noo About 25 minutes in.  The best thing for Muay Thai or any fighting sport (I'm a fan of all of them pretty much) is to increase exposure so that the masses are engaged and become educated.  It will never get rid of the biases people hold but it will help reduce them greatly and ideally lead to more consistent judging."

MuayThai,3ci85e,bwaters777,3,Wed Jul 8 02:48:13 2015 UTC,Go in with the same mind set as a ring just with the added benefit of not being able to fall out. Using the clinch in the cage is probably the biggest benefit due to the walls you're surrounded by. It some what makes it easier to hunt people down and really lay in the knees.

MuayThai,3ci85e,AlmostFamous502,3,Wed Jul 8 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"If you're fighting on the counter, the lack of corners makes it much easier to backpedal and evade an aggressive fighter without getting caught in a corner.   If you find yourself adopting the pressure role in this fight, keep in mind that cutting off his movement is going to be more difficult than it has been in the rings, and if you aren't careful you could find yourself getting frustrated, chasing instead of cutting, and getting caught rushing in over extended.

You can hang them off a door overnight and they will be good to go for your next session.  http://www.miafightshop.com/products/glove-dogs-boxing-glove-dryer-and-deodorizer  Depending if you have leather gloves you can use vasaline to keep the leather moist. Don't use leather cleaner since it good cause allergic reactions in some people.   Aside from that use lysol wipes to clean your gear."

MuayThai,3cgphj,terdfurgesen,3,Wed Jul 8 20:13:17 2015 UTC,I use a plastic bottle ($1.50) and I fill it with 90% water and 10% bleach ($1.99 per gallon).  I spray down my gear after every session.  I wash my hand wraps in cold after every use.  I usually collect dirty wraps and wash every three or four days or so in a mesh bag.  Nothing ever smells.  Ever.
MuayThai,3cgphj,KingSetoshin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"That's a really good idea. I'm not going to lie, I rarely wash my gear. Last time I did was about two-three weeks ago. Definitely going to use your spray method."

Get air everywhere  Never roll your wraps when they are wet.  google how to clean leather, leather maintenance tips, and car leather interior tips.   Understand that killing bacteria is as simple as changing the environment (PH, competition, oxygen saturation, moisture). Chemicals do 1 of 2 things, 1- change the PH levels (antiseptic) 2 - permeates by either allowing the water or using fats within the solution or literally lifts shit via chemical reactions.  Either way slowly over time you're removing the treatment the leather received during manufacturing process which gives it nutrition to stay lovely to when the leather will start drying out.  They have yet to figure out how to market/sell air and the removal of moisture for such a thing. Also find out the origins of wild yeast (you want wild yeast).  I'm not saying never use chemicals, just don't use them all the time.    When I get home from training I put everything out to dry. As much of the inside of the glove exposed as possible in front of an open window  I have 2 rice in bags/socks. The bag itself gets emptied and stays wide open (I use a hiking bag where the whole front opens up)  Shorts and wraps I leave out to dry under shade for 2+ days and I hand wash them maybe once every 1-2 months.  Mouth guard is rinsed after training and when I get home as well then out to dry.  Nothing ever smells. Ever. and my gloves last me for years now."

MuayThai,3cgphj,CLICKTRT,2,Wed Jul 8 19:57:58 2015 UTC,"The best cure is an ounce of prevention. Air your gloves right after working out. One thing I heard about was soaking your hands in Purell, or other alcohol washes, then stick your hands in the gloves and work it around. Afterwards, put the gloves in the sun or a warm place to accelerate the evaporation process. I think this would work well right after a workout, in order to evaporate moisture, but I don’t know what it will do to the inner lining, if anything. You can also put a sock stuffed with baking soda to absorb moisture and odors, but some powder will escape to the inside of the glove. You can also put a few dryer sheets inside, especially if it’s going to be a few days before the next use."

For the outside clean them with a wet wipe and the apply a bit of moisturizer (nivea) every few weeks.   For the shin guards just let them out so they dry out and use moisturizer also.

Air them out regularly but avoid direct sunlight as it will ruin the leather. Store in a mesh bag. Trainers also recommend cutting a bar of soap and keeping it inside the gloves when not in use.

MuayThai,3chwn5,usfdude223,3,Wed Jul 8 03:36:49 2015 UTC,"What helped me was a heavy bag drill.  You basically teep a heavy bag and never let the bag swing back towards you completely. Every time the bag comes back, you teep it. Switch feet every teep. It helped with my aiming, teep strength, and timing.  Edit: The reason this helps you center your teeps is that if you teep the bag and your foot lands off-center, the bag spins out of control off to the sides. During this drill, the bag should move away and back towards you in a straight line."

This complex does well up until a certain point where it does not. It is good that you recognise it, now recognise it is no longer working for you. You have achieved so much and pushing yourself too much will only cause you to crash and burn.  You may never not feel inferior, but you should try and ease up on yourself. This is hard, because it can be very deeply ingrained. Take a break from Muay Thai/Soccer/Lifting and let yourself ""relax"" for a bit. It will not feel like relaxing at first, but try and get into the habit of letting yourself relax for some periods of time. Get in the habit of not being so hard on yourself all the time, it's as good a habit to get into as pushing yourself."

The truth is no one cares about how good or bad you are.  We are all too busy trying not to puke or fuck up our own techniques.    Every single one of us was you.  All of us couldn't skip rope and had a very hard time learning techniques.   You have a learning disability that prevents you from learning how to skip?  I would've considered that an issue if you didn't tell me you play soccer while studying for a masters degree.  If you can dribble a soccer ball, you can skip rope.  We all have things that hinder us from getting better.  You're not a doomed 1% of the population.  You're part of the 99% of people that have insecurities, doubts and excuses for failure.  As silly as this sounds, the first step to mastering a technique is to envision yourself doing it.  Perception is reality.    You know what I did when I was too clumsy to skip......I fucking skipped rope.  I whipped the shit out of toes and I fucking skipped until I could do it.  I'll give you my best Shia Labeouf and ""JUST DO IT!"". Im also flexing.  Sorry if I was insensitive about your learning disorder.  But I don't give a shit about it and neither should you."

MuayThai,3cd5ww,dragon_engine,2,Wed Jul 8 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"You're right. But How long did it take you to learn to skip rope? As I said in my post. I've probably gone to 85+ classes, skipped rope each time, plus do a little bit on my own on Saturday (when I go into to do Yoga and hit the bag) and still feel as if I have not progressed in it.   Can't deny the wisdom of your words though. Perception is reality."
MuayThai,3cd5ww,zombicore,3,Tue Jul 7 12:58:11 2015 UTC,Respectfully brother....it doesn't matter how long it took me to learn how to skip.  I nor anyone else is an accurate measurement for your progress.    85 seems like a lot but it's not much.  I bought a rope and skipped twice daily at home for about 3 months before I could do my first cross over.  That in itself is more than 85 tries.    Go buy yourself a rope and skip at home when no one is watching.  Start with one leg only.  Then try the other.  Then mix them both.  Remember the rope is less than an inch thick.  You don't need to jump that high.
MuayThai,3cd5ww,Scoiatael,4,Tue Jul 7 15:52:32 2015 UTC,"I suck at learning techniques too. I forget stuff I learned, even the same day sometimes.  What helped was staying after a few minutes and just going over the techniques learned on some bags. More importantly, out of the techniques learned that day, find one that you like in particular. It doesn't have to be amazing, but one you just really like or see yourself using. Practice that.  I went from remembering nothing to remembering the technique I liked the most, which more often than not was one that fit my style. My sparring had improved more as I throw a higher variety of combos now.  In the end, stop comparing yourself to others. The only real opponent you're competing against is yourself. Not to sound like Zen BS, but no matter where you end up down the road years from now, your outward environment and opponent will change, but you will still be fighting yourself."

MuayThai,3cd5ww,KingSetoshin,3,Tue Jul 7 12:35:12 2015 UTC,"Based on what you wrote, you haven't even been doing this for a year. These are skills that are developed over many years with ups and downs. Take your time and work on your foundational techniques. Don't try to be the best at your school, just pick one one thing to improve every time you train. If you want to be an expert in a year then you're going to be disappointed."
MuayThai,3cd5ww,tacostandguy,4,Tue Jul 7 03:23:18 2015 UTC,"I think you need to sit down and think, why do I want to do Muay Thai?  I've been doing Muay Thai for 5 years now. After 5 years my boxing is still pretty bad and my kicking is only decent. I suck at skipping, but luckily we don't do it that often. I will occasionally miss some time, hell today was my first time back in a month. Like you I pay for the year to make sure I don't quit. So why do I keep going?  Because I do it for fun and to keep in shape. I don't like going to the gym, but I like hitting stuff. So Muay Thai works for me. I may not be good at a lot of things, but one thing I am good at is my defense, especially against kicks. I will often catch people's round house kicks, as if they were doing a teep, and they will just look at me confused as to how I managed to time that. Its better to focus on the positives, and not dwell on the negatives. Every day you go to class, focus on improving. You shouldn't care about how other people there might think of you, or how good some other guy got after going for a few months. Always be willing to learn, and be open to take advice from others. You are there to learn an art, and no one is judging you."
MuayThai,3cd5ww,tacostandguy,3,Tue Jul 7 07:08:05 2015 UTC,"If you can't skip here's a couple alternatives while the rest of the class is skipping rope. You can just bounce sort of like the way some boxers bounce in their stance, going from putting weight on the left to the right etc... Another is you hold the jump rope with just one hand (both handles) and swing it only on that side while bouncing. This is actually how I teach people to skip rope. And another thing you can do while the class is skipping is just warm up with bag work. I rolled my ankle recently so I'm not skipping rope. I go to the bag do knees, push kicks, light boxing whatever. Don't worry man. Not everyone is the built the same. We all have limitations somewhere. Don't hate yourself for it just accept who you are. Good luck."

MuayThai,3cd5ww,1931078649,3,Tue Jul 7 12:37:33 2015 UTC,"Happy birthday in advance.  I think you're doing a lot better than you think you are. In fact, you're probably doing better than most people. You have a learning disability but are a masters student and you have a very active and varied lifestyle. That's impressive for anyone.  You seem like the type of person that likes to keep to your own personal goals (hence why you paid up front), so you're probably going to continue to go to class. I would go to your kru/coach and tell them about your learning disability and how it might cause some difficulties. If anything, you might get some props for being very open about your difficulties and persevering through it. They will undoubtedly become more understanding after that, so you will not have to be self-conscious about them mocking you. In fact, in most good gyms no one excessively focuses on the mistakes of others. You're there to learn and everyone of the advanced students was in the same place as you at some point.  If you have the time, maybe write down what you learned after the class and then when you get home, try and incorporate it into your shadow boxing routine. Your Muay Thai gym should be a place you love to go to. I would try and make a few friends there so it becomes less laborious. Try and watch some of the brilliant Muay Thai motivation videos on the web to draw some inspiration. Set yourself specific goals to work to (e.g. interclub/smoker fights, being fitter, being able to kick a baseball bat in half)."
MuayThai,3cc278,thebearjewster,8,Mon Jul 6 19:14:37 2015 UTC,How about some Ramon Dekkers fights?  I haven't watched his fights in years (need to fix that) so I may be misrepresenting but while he wasn't a pure puncher at all but he did use an aggressive punch heavy style which may let you pick some things up.  Honestly though might be better to postpone the fight until your foot is healed.  Edit: Psyflame corrected my butchering of his name.

MuayThai,3cc278,oddnigga_withaspoon,2,Tue Jul 7 05:51:28 2015 UTC,My foot does work. Like I said I can move on it just fine. It has to get hit at a specific angle to get messed up. Unfortunately if it gets hit checking a kick that angle is likely to be hit
MuayThai,3capby,bw0wser,9,Mon Jul 6 12:50:33 2015 UTC,"Are you wrapping your hands properly? I hit pretty hard but I never have problems with any hand pain. Maybe look into Mexican-style hand wraps, or try a different wrapping technique. I usually go over my wrist 3 times in the beginning of wrapping, and another 3 times at the end."
MuayThai,3capby,PinkPicklePete,6,Mon Jul 6 13:18:44 2015 UTC,"Your hand and your forearm should be in one line when you punch. Especially the knuckles of your pointer and middle finger and your forearm because those are the two knuckles you want to hit with.  Most wrist injuries come from improper form, usually either hitting with the outside of the fist (pinky side; more common in straights), or with the inside of the hand (wrist flexed up; very common in hooks). In some rare cases, guys flex the wrist the other way.  Make sure to have proper alignment in every punch. The wraps are pretty much only there to support the wrist. The padding over the knuckles is really not much with training wraps and it's not that important either. A proper wrap will limit your range of movement and compress the writs a bit. This reduces the risk of injuries, but it's no substitute for good form.  My advice: tell your coach about it and have him look at your form. If that stuff helps you, maybe record ourself and have a look at it or post it here. But I can pretty much guarantee that this is a technique issue."
MuayThai,3capby,Athrul,3,Mon Jul 6 14:26:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this advice. I'd also recommend doing pushups on your knuckles, with the first & second knuckles making contact with the ground. Take note of your wrist position when doing them, because it forces your wrist to be properly aligned. Knuckle pushups also build wrist & knuckle strength."

MuayThai,3capby,PlayerXz,2,Wed Jul 8 09:35:00 2015 UTC,It is important that you punch with the right technique otherwise your punches are weak and you can hurt yourself. Generally speaking you want to hold your hand in a straight line with your arm.

This is how I wrap my hands, if you have smaller hands then you will have more wrap to finish on your wrist in the end.  I find starting higher on your wrist and then wrapping down is more secure than wrapping the same place over and over. Perhaps your gloves do not offer enough support.  Keeping your forearm in line with your wrist is vital, when I was doing karate they made us do knuckle pushups to get the idea across. Wrist strengthening exercises is another option."

MuayThai,3capby,Stewthulhu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:50:21 2015 UTC,"It strongly depends on the nature of the pain and its cause. ""Hurting wrists"" could be about a dozen different things. It's possible you could sustain long-term injury if you damage your wrists, but without knowing the nature of that damage and the nature of your training, it's impossible to say much at all.  Do your wrists buckle a lot when you punch? What knuckles do you punch with? Does one type of punch hurt worst? How tight are you clenching your fists? Are you using wraps? What gloves are you using? Etc etc."

I know it feels great to haul off and knock shit silly, but you don't have to hit like a Mack truck to train effectively. In fact emphasizing slower drilling to perfect form is pretty standard. Power comes from speed which comes from technique."
MuayThai,3capby,JorgFink,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:37:37 2015 UTC,It depends on what you are doing though but I agree with this to a certain extent. Some exercises like heavy bags are made for hitting hard while sparring and pads are for technique.
MuayThai,3capby,Manzanis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:38:23 2015 UTC,"My guess, in addition to what Athrul said about your form, it might also be the pad holder. Some partners I've had, seem to think it's up to them  to supply power and slam the pads into my fists, especially the right-cross. It tweaks my wrists. I always tell them to let me supply the power, just give me enough resistance and a little slap so the pad doesn't go flying.   Wraps might help a bit, but you shouldn't depend on them to keep your wrists straight, IMO. Most of my wraps are on my knuckles and it's fairly minimal around my wrists.  But I suspect your form is wrong. Hard to tell without seeing it."

MuayThai,3c5rtl,MarshallUberSwagga,5,Sun Jul 5 06:46:29 2015 UTC,The success of a 'striker' is based upon their ability to deal damage to their opponent. If Anderson and Saenchai had an MMA fight his striking would be terrible because the dynamics of striking in MMA are totally different to those of MT. Now would that make Saenchai a worse striker than Anderson? No. Because they compete in different sports and different weight classes.   It's like saying hey guys Mike Tyson has better striking than Mighty Mouse? Check out this highlight to prove it.
MuayThai,3c5rtl,Priapraxis,6,Sun Jul 5 13:15:35 2015 UTC,"I think there are two sides to this. The level of striking in the stadiums IS of a much higher quality than what we see in MMA, due to the fact that muay thai has been around for decades longer than MMA and the coaching and talent have had more time to develop. It's also due to the fact that MMA fighters have to train in grappling extensively, where as MT fighters can focus purely on striking.   Having said that, like you mentioned MMA striking is completely different from MT and just because you have good MT or kickboxing credentials doesn't mean you'll blitz everyone on the feet (joe schilling as an obvious example). The gloves and cage alone make a huge difference let alone the threat of takedowns. If you watch caged muay thai, it is way sloppier and less refined than regular australian muay thai. The distancing is different with the smaller gloves and the circular cage, punches and kicks also slip through a lot more easily."
MuayThai,3c5rtl,goomba14,2,Sun Jul 5 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"My point is more that 'striking' as a skill can't really be quantified between sports. So any conversation about it is essentially moot since one person has better striking here and someone else has better striking there saying that one person has objectively better striking is, especially when it's saying a MT guy is better than a non MT guy on a MT subreddit, it's just a circle jerk.   I agree with what you're saying but my point still stands."
MuayThai,3c5rtl,Priapraxis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this. I agree very much with Goomba14. People acting like Muay Thai is not transferable to MMA and radically different need to pay more attention. Of course body kicks etc are much harder to pull off in MMA due to the threat of a takedown, but that doesn't excuse Silva's overall average technique when throwing kicks, teeps, low kicks or in the clinch, which all transfer very well into MMA. Jose Aldo is a great example of a guy with good technique using it to his advantage. He low kicks properly, whereas Anderson Silva doesn't, which is a big reason he broke his leg.  I feel like 'it's a different sport' is a crux for defending poor technique sometimes. Silva is obviously a great fighter, but a great muay thai practioner? Not so much. Anyone who has fought in or practiced both sports knows that the dynamics of Muay Thai striking in MMA are not all that dissimilar to actual Muay Thai. The only difference, really, as far as I've seen training in both is the stance.  Besides, there aren't any truly world class Muay Thai fighters in MMA, as far as I'm aware, apart from Dejdamrong Sor Amnuaysirichoke and he's beat everyone he's faced thus far."
MuayThai,3c5rtl,KidGavilan,3,Mon Jul 6 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"It's really just a semantic argument that people seem incapable of understanding you even say   Silva is obviously a great fighter, but a great muay thai practioner? Not so much.    No one is saying he's the GOAT muay thai practitioner, no one is saying he has better MT, the point I'm attempting to make is that striking is a fluid thing and comparing people from different sports and weight classes in this very general term is fucking stupid.  And the dynamic I'm talking about isn't just the way people use their technique, I could say karate is better than Muay Thai because Andy Hug would have destroyed Saenchai in a K1 rules fight but that's an extremely stupid comparison to make. There's waaaay more to MMA striking than just the stance you use and the ultimate measuring stick of a striker is how he / she is able to inflict damage to their opponent not if they look pretty doing it.   Besides, there aren't any truly world class Muay Thai fighters in MMA, as far as I'm aware, apart from Dejdamrong Sor Amnuaysirichoke and he's beat everyone he's faced thus far.    That's the thing too, I don't know if it's humanly possible to have Saenchai or buakaw level MT and have the required level of grappling expertise to be competitive in MMA."

MuayThai,3c65xq,dragon_engine,2,Tue Jul 7 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"I have very limited experience with Muay Thai, but was a TKD/kickboxing practitioner for 13 years.   I'll give my advice as a kickboxer, and hopefully some of it will transfer over to MT. Being a very tall (and skinny) fighter, inside fighters were pretty much everyone I went up against. I've found that a good approach was to keep them off of me/punish them with kicks (straight kicks, side kicks, teeps), but the most important thing was movement. Inside fighters rush in when they get frustrated, and frequently you can bait and counter them with a solid jab. Jab and move, jab and move. Jab - fake to evade - sharp combo - actually evade.   I don't know how applicable this is for you though, because MT has a different mentality than TKD or kickboxing when it comes to movement, and I would be concerned about eating leg kicks on the evade part of my plan (although, if you're evading straight back all the time, you kinda deserve to eat a leg kick).  Regardless, a good stiff jab will serve you well (stiff enough to actually stop his progression). Maybe even consider a stiff-arm, just to keep him off. Additionally, and I might be off-base here with my limited MT experience, it seems to me that if someone is in range to throw hooks/uppercuts, they're almost in range for an elbow or knee, especially being a tall fighter. I would imagine a couple elbows to the face would make your opponent much less willing to commit to a big hook (just don't get knocked out from an unexpected uppercut).   And of course, you could just go Dieselnoi on his ass."
MuayThai,3c65xq,Ranandom,2,Sun Jul 5 14:48:00 2015 UTC,"I saw a video of a Muay Thai legend and he was taller than average. He always had his jab hand out in their face and used it for defense more than offense. That same arm, he had his shoulder in front of his chin for layer 2 of defense and then his other arm covered his face for 3 layers of defense. If they got past layer one which is jab arm, he would clinch them and destroy them. Another strategy is that if you can't beat them, join them and become a better inside fighter than the people you are fighting. Specific moves? teep pretty much. Also for counters to overhand right, just move away or with your back foot, go flat footed while they throw the shot and you going flatfooted brings your whole body back bringing your face back then just do the basic day one of Muay Thai 1,2 kick or any combo you want once it passes your face."

If you can use them, take advantage of it."

I'll also add that overhands are the natural counter to the jab, and I'd wager your shorter sparring partners have picked up on this and are timing their overhand to come over the top of your jab and ping you one. It's called a cross counter. If this is happening to you start feinting your jabs more, they'll wiff overhands that way then get tentative to throw them at all when you light them up for it."

MuayThai,3c0ww4,earldouglas,4,Fri Jul 3 19:22:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe talk to the instructor/gym owner about putting down less grippy mats or something.   Alternately, you can try putting duct tape on the bottom of your shoes when you train. Or taping around the front of the shoes.  Besides your soles, though, watch your knees as well. Lots of repetitive strong twists like that will put strain on them for sure"
MuayThai,3c0ww4,doodleydoo,2,Fri Jul 3 20:24:38 2015 UTC,Unless your feet are getting worn down to the point where they are bleeding or something I wouldnt wear shoes.  Scrape off the callus with a (I forget what they're called) 'callus stone' OR get a pedicure (the ladies at the shop will be much better than you at getting the calluses off and theyll have a 'cheese grater thingy' which will be more efficient.    Then tape your toes and the area that is getting callused for a week or so until it heals up a bit.  Its a recurring problem and theres not really that much that you can do for it to the best of my knowledge.  This happens to me all the time.  If somebody has another solution I'd love to hear it.

MuayThai,3c1glc,sharked,2,Sat Jul 4 01:31:50 2015 UTC,I was saying Buakaw doesn't want to fight Yod.  I think it's a bad match up for him.  Yods left kick is too strong.  Yod is also younger by 3 years.    I also think they wouldn't want to fight each other.  They are both nak muays that came from poverty.  Fighting each other will just hurt the long term profit potential they have.  Unless someone puts up a serious fight prize I don't see this fight happening.

MuayThai,3c1vr7,imaskingwhy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"I might can answer this. I have a standing bag that I got for free. It's pretty decent, but:  I can't go a full 360 degrees around it  I have to make sure I don't hit the bars with my foot  Even at 145 pounds, my kicks send the light bag flying and stand rocking back and forth. I'm fairly sure the apartment below me hates me."
MuayThai,3c1vr7,SqueeStarcraft,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"It does allow basic movements and is probably better than nothing, but it's not really a solid target at all since if you hit it with any force it will move.  My admittedly limited experience --deliberately limited-- of standing heavy bags is that they pretty much all suck and are not really intended or designed for use by serious martial artists and instead, are designed for the casual fitness consumer who may also have a ""bowflex,"" an elliptical or digital running machine, and maybe a few free-weights out in their garage or basement along with last month's issue of ""Runner's World.""    Not that there's anything wrong with that; I applaud physical fitness no matter how it is engendered.    The point is though, that if you are training martial arts, your big hanging heavy bag isn't something that can really be faked.  Try it yourself.  You will immediately notice the difference."

MuayThai,3c0p0z,ghetto_brit,8,Fri Jul 3 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"I love seeing muay thai fighters with a TKD background. I personally think muay thai is the more practical martial art.  Depending on the schools, there is generally more sparring and you learn to fight in more ranges using more weapons than just kicks and punches.  Our school basically teaches western style boxing and mixes in kicks, elbows, knees, sweeps, and clinching.    I think muay thai is a far stronger base style than TKD but it's awesome to see a muay thai fighter that can pull off flashy TKD kicks when the situation presents itself.    Personally,  i would try the muay thai to see if you like it and if you do make the switch.  If you do switch don't completely forget your TKD background.  A lot of the high risk,  flashy kicks can get you into trouble but sometimes am opportunity presents itself to really catch someone off guard."
MuayThai,3c0p0z,Toaster_In_Bathtub,2,Fri Jul 3 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"Just curious, I've never done muay thai but from what I can see in MT kicks...it doesn't look as ""graceful"" as a TKD kick but it definitely looks far more aggressive. One key thing I notice is that TKD kicks, we're told to point out our toes, using the point of our feet as a striking point but I rarely see this in MT.  As someone who might consider going MT with 1 year of TKD training, are there any habits someone from TKD needs to adjust when going into MT?"
MuayThai,3c0p0z,heyyouyeahyou55,2,Fri Jul 3 21:03:11 2015 UTC,We don't point out our toes in muay thai because we're landing our kicks with our shins and not the top of the foot.   I don't know too much about TKD but one thing for sure you'll need to change is the stance. From what I've seen TKD has a really side on stance. This leaves the front leg very exposed to leg kicks and it is a lot harder to transition to left kicks (or right if you are southpaw). Muay thai uses a more squared up stance which allows you to check kicks on either side a lot faster and to do a quick drop shift (changing from regular stance to southpaw for a split second) and throw left kicks.
MuayThai,3c0p0z,Toaster_In_Bathtub,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:11:44 2015 UTC,Thanks mate! The gym I've been looking at offers a 30-day trial so I can probably take a look in a few weeks when I have more free time

MuayThai,3c013t,davids1153,19,Fri Jul 3 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"It's OK to be nervous.  Just stay under control when you spar.  A 3x world champ should not hurt you in your first sparring session......unless you try to hurt him.    Sparring is practice.  It's not a test and not about winning or losing.  Stay analytical and deliberate.  If you find yourself spazzing out in over reactions, take a step back and slow things down.   It's OK to say ""can you do that again?"" or ""what just happened?""  Chok Dee."

MuayThai,3c013t,Remi_The_master,3,Fri Jul 3 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"Well, first piece of advice is just realize its not that big of a thing! You're not gonna go jump into a 5 round war. its just gonna be light sparring for your first time. Just to get you used to the feeling of having hits come at you, and getting you used to thinking on your feet.  As for actually calming down, try to focus on one thing. Think of one move or combo or piece of footwork you think you're good at and just have using it well as your main goal. A goal i think most people fail at is simple, ""Don't gas out"" :P  Similarly, do you have any physical attributes you can exploit?   Other than that, just have fun! its easy to get the nervs but when you get in it it'll feel right :)"
MuayThai,3c013t,biggerthangod,2,Fri Jul 3 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say focus on breathing, your combos, and footwork. It's going to be light sparring, so it'll be more about applying what you've learned than actually trying to hit your partner with some force. For your nerves, I'd try looking at it as a learning experience and a fun time, over anything else"
MuayThai,3c013t,HailHydreigon,2,Fri Jul 3 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"My biggest advice is to not turn it into a fight. If you get nervous and start trying to knock his head off, you might get it worse in return."
MuayThai,3c013t,Doghatchet,2,Fri Jul 3 16:59:01 2015 UTC,Cheers for the advise. I know deep down he's not going to kick 7 shades of shit out of me so I'll just have to take a deep breath.   She did have someone else in mind but decided not to. Apparantly she felt he would try to 'one bomb??' me so went with someone else. Obviously she's trying to ease me into it. I'm 42 and the average age of the gym is about 22 with some very good active fighters in the mix.
MuayThai,3c013t,cobainsdragon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:17:53 2015 UTC,"Lots of good advice from everyone here (except for kicking in the nuts). What I like to do when sparring with someone new to sparring is to talk through it. It kind of helps keep things relaxed and shows there's no animosity between myself and the student. It also allows you to develop good habits by correcting them and practicing them in real time. A typical conversation may sound like this:  Me: OK, if you're unsure what to do, just start working your jab. Use it to find your range and see if it will allow you to set up other strikes behind it.  Me: You're doing great, but try to relax and control your strikes a bit more. Focus on technique like I'm doing with you.  Student: You keep teeping me when I try to engage. How can I get around that.  Me: (stopping to explain for a moment). When I throw the teep, try sweeping it like so. I'm going to throw just some teeps at you for the next bit. Practice that.  Me: Perfect, let's go back to normal sparring. I want you to end every combination with a kick now.  Student: I'm having trouble getting into the proper range. None of my punches are landing.  Me: Ok, try doing this blah blah blah  Hopefully you get the idea. Having a conversation lets you gauge what you should be doing, gives you something specific to work on and lets you know if what you're doing is right or wrong. Suggest it to your trainer and give it a try!"
MuayThai,3c013t,cream-of-cow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:49:13 2015 UTC,Keep your hands up and try to spar with someone with a lot of experience. The more experience the more control they will likely have and you'll have a better learning opportunity.  Also if someone more skilled then you is willing to take time and spar YOU should make the offer to hold pads for them. It's a nice gesture and learning pads is an important skill too.
MuayThai,3c013t,ganglydav,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:46:26 2015 UTC,"Being nervous is good, stay nervous, don't get confident and slack off. No matter how well you know this person or trust the situation, always keep your guard up or the trainer will teach you a lesson in it. If you get hit too hard for your taste, take a step back, point to where you got hit, do a ""lower"" motion with your hand to signal that was too hard for practice."

MuayThai,3c013t,iansolidgoldie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:25:32 2015 UTC,Breathing. Slow and steady in and out.   Tension. Tense everything and then relax it. As you spar you will stiffen up. Tense and release.
MuayThai,3c013t,JorgFink,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:29:18 2015 UTC,If you feel you're getting out of your depth don't be afraid to ask your partner to ease up a little. Also if you do get nervous and hit a little harder than intended there's a good chance you'll be hit back so try and relax and above all have fun with it.
MuayThai,3c013t,g0zer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:43:10 2015 UTC,"You might want to ask if you can start out just doing some light trading. That means he throws a 2-4 strike combo at you while you focus on defense/movement, and then you return the same. That way you focus on defense, distance and making light contact. Remember, he'll go as hard as you go, so if you want him to go light, you have to start out going light. Punch with an open hand, don't hit his mouth or nose (jab to the forehead), kick and punch with proper form but target about 25% power and about 50-75% speed - don't do those little fake, snappy, Karate kicks or punches just to score points."

MuayThai,3c013t,rockitalex,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:25:41 2015 UTC,Don't be nervous about sparring with a high caliber fighter. They're the best to learn from. A big reason is control. Your partner will know exactly when to ease up on you if it's too much and avoid either of you getting hurt.   Your trainer wouldn't be putting you in to spar unless you had a solid understanding of how to handle yourself. Just keep your hands up and stick to your basic combos. You might just surprise yourself with how much fun you'll have :)

What's worse than getting kicked in the balls is getting kicked in the guard and having one of your balls caught between the guard and your body. I can't help but feel like the Thai size and American size is a subtle dick joke.
MuayThai,3bxlea,JP-Kiwi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a feeling the medium is too small. The large fits comfortably against my skin, whereas the medium has the gap. I can't tell for sure, but I have a feeling that the medium isn't as deep as the large and might be resting against my junk rather than encasing it. I wouldn't want to take a kick to the groin and have the pressure of the kick plus the steel mashing into me."
MuayThai,3bxlea,sharked,2,Fri Jul 3 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"I know a guy that nearly lost a nut, when his nut got stuck between his cup ridge and his groin.  Combine that with a low blow and he was out for nearly 6 months.  I used to use a steel cup, but I now use a lobloo.  It's a modern interpretation of the Thai steel cup."

MuayThai,3bsg8x,sylviemuay,3,Thu Jul 2 06:13:41 2015 UTC,"She fought Kradaitong Por Promin. It looks like she is trying to portray herself as an active fighter again. I've asked a promoter to see if she would accept a fight with me (she's much bigger than me, I suspect, so it seemed like maybe a match she'd take), but he said that she's very expensive to book, so unlikely."

MuayThai,3bsg8x,cerebral_mindset,13,Thu Jul 2 07:50:13 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty bizarre article. Not even remotely accurate. Laughably so, in fact.  Females have been fighting for a long LONG time before this lady ever came along & they reference her as the first ever world champ? Errrr........ what?  The only organisation she ever won a title with was the WPMF - an association not even created till around 2005. Outside of legit stadium titles, the WMC and their amateur branch (the IFMA) is the only legit organisation. They've been around since day 1 and are like all 4 of the big boxing associations rolled into one. For anyone wandering how the female champs line up in the WPMF....... half the weights have been vacant for a couple of years now at least, their world champs are not even the best fighters from their own country in some cases & they haven't even managed to spell their own champions names correctly on their own website or the Wikipedia page they maintain >.<"
MuayThai,3bsg8x,sylviemuay,2,Thu Jul 2 02:37:34 2015 UTC,Agreed that article seems like it has an agenda.  Even just the line portraying her as the prettiest girl in Thailand?  Reeally.
MuayThai,3bsg8x,sharked,4,Thu Jul 2 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"The WPMF, despite lots of problems, actually is doing better with female Muay Thai than pretty much any other organization, including the WMC which not that long ago was the standard bearer (the WMC has only been around since 1995, 10 years longer). There is no qualitative difference between WMC, WPMF and WBC female Muay Thai champions that I can see, at least in the weight classes I'm familiar with. The WPMF actually updates it's website list of champions fairly frequently (though the fighter rankings are not accurate), and attempts to even keep track of the otherwise somewhat dubious ""Interim"" champions. No other world wide sanctioning org even comes close. Last I checked the WMC doesn't even list its female champions, nor does the WBC, let alone ranked fighters. I wish it was better, but only the WPMF seems to be focused on female Muay Thai now. The vacant WMPF belts are for higher weights that WMPF productions don't focus on as they are a Thai/Japanese oriented organization."
MuayThai,3bsg8x,sylviemuay,3,Thu Jul 2 04:24:37 2015 UTC,I saw her in a few fights in S-cup.  She was way too small to be fighting those girls and got beat up.    https://youtu.be/v6PZIyUUYr8  https://youtu.be/35KUpmmElcI  btw-  Shootboxing is awesome.
MuayThai,3bsg8x,sharked,2,Thu Jul 2 03:04:08 2015 UTC,"Rena is probably the best female Muay Thai fighter in the world at that size. In my opinion it wasn't that Zaza was too small. Rena is just that good...and, Japanese S rules don't favor Thai fighters much either."

MuayThai,3brfq9,themuaythaiguy,2,Wed Jul 1 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"A budding fighter goes to another gym, gets matched with someone of equal experience, and lightly spars for a few minutes with shin guards. A referee also makes sure no one goes too hard. This is known as an interclub (or ‘smoker fight’).   Personally, I've never seen a smoker like that.  I'm not saying that those don't exist, but people go pretty hard at every smoker I've attended.  They're fully geared up, but they go hard."
MuayThai,3brfq9,thibedeauxmarxy,2,Wed Jul 1 19:35:08 2015 UTC,"Same. Our gym does smokers, and they wear protective gear (no head protection though) but go 100%."

MuayThai,3brfq9,sharked,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:21:36 2015 UTC,"I think OP might mean that while the fighters are going 100%, the refs are very conservative about calling stops and time-outs etc. to make absolutely sure no one gets close to hurt.  Almost all of my interclubs were conducted in this fashion. Also, most of my interclubs had the fighters simulating real match conditions, e.g 8 oz gloves and either thin shin guards like soccer ones or no shin guards at all."

MuayThai,3bs89c,buakaw9,3,Wed Jul 1 18:54:49 2015 UTC,"Try to get the lead hand over the top of theirs and always keep to the outside of their lead leg.   Parry the lead long arm and drive the rear low kick to the inside leg ( you can follow up by sweeping their lead leg with the rear also sometimes, or go to the body)  Either practice catching the teep or timing a sweep depending on which leg is teeping, use a partner to drill this (without taking them down every time, just technically striking at the achilles)  TL:DR : Train loads of timing drills"
MuayThai,3bs89c,7hereem,2,Wed Jul 1 23:24:43 2015 UTC,"When someone his an advantage over you in some aspects you have to make it up in others, otherwise you'll have a tough time. Catch the teep, but if he's too tall you're probably out of range for a sweep or dump, and if you go forward he can probably hit you easily with a left. So I catch the teep with the left hand, yank on it going back a bit to mess up their balance, throw it and try to counter with a right kick. Try to always catch the teep to frustrate him. I also try kicking the side of their leg if they leave the teep out.  Re the stiff arm, move in like a boxer side-to-side. If he rests the hand on your forehead push it off. Try working on your sliding inside-leg kick, those have a lot of range. And tall fighters are usually range fighters, and the way you deal with them is constant pressure."
MuayThai,3bs89c,JorgFink,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:04:05 2015 UTC,"Also if you can avoid the teep, get in close and go to town :) don't back away!  Edit: obviously this relies on you timing a teep and deflecting it. Should be pretty easy after a while. A few feints should do it!"
MuayThai,3bs89c,brookesy2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:06:09 2015 UTC,"Probably bot the best advice because I'm pretty new. But when I was sparring with the coach, his were always making contact so I'd step back and go for a kick on the inside of the leading leg. If you can block it by making their weight carry them, the you have a lot more options. But I struggle in noticing that it's coming and check the leg instead which does not work. Have you tried not getting them done on you."

MuayThai,3bqabj,no-sempai-dont,10,Wed Jul 1 07:39:29 2015 UTC,"I've only been doing muay thai for around seven months so I'm no expert, but if I need to get out of kicking range and into punching range, I try a few feints and angles to get in closer. It generally works.  In fact, doing a few classes in boxing will help you with this. Learning how to slip and find the best angle in to get into punching range will help immensely. Essentially, keep being a moving target and eventually you will probably find an opening to get through into punching range."
MuayThai,3bqabj,KingSetoshin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:55:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice! It seems my problem must be movement, because I just come from front on. Ill work on these things next :)"
MuayThai,3bqabj,redjah,6,Wed Jul 1 08:42:51 2015 UTC,"I've had similar problems before and still do at times. Footwork, feints and angles will get you in. I'm 5'5"" and everyone in my gym is taller and most are heavier than me. I like to teep a lot so I chain a lot of combos off faking teeps and moving in for punches. Other than that, take a page off some boxing and move, move, move until you find an opening. Bait strikes, blitz in then angle out. Mix up the approaches because a good fighter will time you or adjust quick if you only do one thing all the time."
MuayThai,3bqabj,redjah,2,Wed Jul 1 08:15:16 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! I'm gonna try that out when I sparnl next. Can you tell me how to use angles properly?
MuayThai,3bqabj,naetdt,3,Wed Jul 1 08:41:16 2015 UTC,"You can create them off slipping punches or utilizing footwork. If you got lots of gas in the tank, moving around and feinting strikes will help but, if you don't, then subtle footwork and timing will create them. I like to take a 45 degree angle before coming in with a strike or take one off of their missed ones. A lot of people don't expect to be hit at that spot off of their missed kicks so it usually works as long as I don't do it all of the time. My best advice to you is to keep sparring and see what works for you. Find a partner that you can technical spar with and explore options. You can also look at fighters that excel on timing and technical proficiency rather than power like Saenchai, Pakorn, Sam A and Giorgio Petrosyan."
MuayThai,3bqabj,naetdt,2,Wed Jul 1 09:36:18 2015 UTC,Thank you a lot for all of the help!  On top of all this I haven't sparred consistently for probably years and so I think I do need a partner or some avenue to spar.
MuayThai,3bqabj,ncguthwulf,5,Wed Jul 1 11:33:33 2015 UTC,"Faking a kick and stepping in,  cutting an angle, or defending a kick and countering with punches seem to work for me."
MuayThai,3bqabj,ncguthwulf,2,Wed Jul 1 08:17:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for you reply, they sound like awesome ideas. How do you properly create an angle?"
MuayThai,3bqabj,itsapardigan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:40:08 2015 UTC,"Quick step to the right or a quick step to the left and pivot. I like to set up for stepping to create an angle by throwing out a jab or a cross depending which way I plan to move. For example, a jab (sometimes a feint) to the face while stepping to the right and following up with a solid right hand after achieving a dominant angle. Sometimes this creates the possibility to throw a strong combination as well.   For me, putting a hand in my opponents face as I move forces them to cover up or move out of the way. Since I'm moving the same time I punch, it's difficult for most people I spar with to effectively counter.   My current favorite is to lead with the jab and step right as mentioned above, throw a hard right cross and follow with a solid left round kick to the body. Opponents that instinctively cover their head to defend the jab/cross combo leave their mid section open to eat a big one."
MuayThai,3bqabj,itsapardigan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:32:44 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! All of this is making much more sense to me now. I was always told to use my angled but never really knew how to hahaha Dx
MuayThai,3bqabj,mjr1,4,Sat Jul 4 14:29:26 2015 UTC,Just keep playing around with it. You'll notice a lot of Fighters tend to either be initiating on a regular basis or countering on a regular basis. If it turns out that you are the type that needs to initiate to feel comfortable then you'll have to get your coach to teach you some setups to get within range. Oftentimes taking a weaker shot on the way in to deliver several really powerful shots is worth it. if you find that you're more comfortable as a counter striker then practice your defense followed immediately by an attack.
MuayThai,3bqabj,mjr1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:58:05 2015 UTC,"This really helped me in sparring tonight, differentiating between initiating and countering like that. This thread is providing me with so much relief lol :')   So if I'm more of a counter striker, I don't have to force myself to initiate like I've been trying to? Cause learning to initiate is definitely doing my head in. I'll ask my coach for some tips on it for sure :)"
MuayThai,3bqabj,Theraformer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:10:33 2015 UTC,"I think I can give you one tip. The teep, or front push kick, should be your longest tool. It's really annoying to get hit by it. As such it can be used to provoke your opponent from range into attacking so that you can work a counter."

I'm not sure about how much you'll have to pay for just a week but their monthly rates were extremely reasonable when I was there.   Don't go to evolve if you're really looking to learn something. Sure they have world champion trainers, but the owner is just so afraid of liabilities they won't let anyone spar unless you're a pro/higher level/been there a long time. Unless you're just looking for a workout and somewhere to spend a shitload of money for only a week go ahead.  If you're interested there are a few other mma gyms. Just off the top of my head there is Impact (this is the gym I went to. Really good if you want to learn bjj, not so much for muay thai. You can spar with the instructors if you want I think, you'll just have to talk to the people there first to see if they're ok with it. Btw this is probably one of the cheaper mma gyms in singapore. Really easy to get to as well), Impakt (yes there is one with a k and one with a c), juggernaut fight club, and fight g."
MuayThai,3bpv07,ForkToTheLeft,8,Wed Jul 1 04:43:53 2015 UTC,"I think once you know the basics well, you should start sparring within a group with the same experience level under supervision, or very tolerant individuals with more experience.   I totally agree that the best way to learn Muay Thai is by doing, not just by repeating combinations. Learning to kick is one skill; learning to successfully kick someone in a fight is a totally different skill. The sooner you start, the better. Also, getting hit is a really good way to learn not to do something.  But I think supervision is crucial. More experienced people can be dickheads and spar way too hard, and they need to be watched for that, but beginners need to be watched and given some guidance about what to do. Otherwise (and I say this having been there) they end up looking like this"
MuayThai,3bpv07,pseudolus,4,Wed Jul 1 06:21:18 2015 UTC,"""Should"" being the key word, I don't think anyone should unless they want to. One month isn't very long, it took me a lot longer to get control of my kicks to land where I want consistently; I believe the teacher should judge each student individually. I avoided sparring for  years because the spar class didn't match my schedule, then on my 2nd day at it, I got a hook to the back of my head where there's no padding (minor concussion) followed by a kick to the face (major concussion). Missed a lot of work, lost a lot of money, won't be sparring again—my mid 40s body is happy with pad work."
MuayThai,3bpv07,cream-of-cow,2,Wed Jul 1 07:44:21 2015 UTC,"Couldnt have said it better. It all depends what the person wants. Some people are more natural and can spar straight away,while some id give a few months or never at all. When we run the regular class, we do a light body sparring (sparring, no hits above shoulder but you can throw jabs to the left or right to practice distance etc or run through drills with gloves and shin guards. This gives everybody a introduction.  Most of the time, if someone wants to spar, they will ask the trainers or the group that normally spar in the ring. People who speak up and get involved tend to stay around more as we know what they want to do. Include them in a lot of extra stuff. We have a few guys who just stay in the corner and dont talk to anyone, they normally stay at the same skill level for a long time. You invite them to spar/condition etc and if they say no a few times, thats it. Its up to them to speak up if they want to spar etc.  We are a small close gym so we normally cater to peoples skill level. A few times we have newbies jumping in trying to take someones head off. They get a few warnings before they get taught a lesson.  Like cream mentioned, as you get older, you do notice your body doesnt cope as much. Ive cut down my sparring a lot since i started working for myself. Im used to going 70-80% prepping fighters for fights and a simple thing can cause injury which slows me down for the week at work. I dont get paid at the gym and i will never make a living from fighting. I still control spar (fun sparring) without gloves and shin pads with the boys im used to. Dont do it with newbies as they are a bigger danger to me imo.  This is a full contact sport and there will be times when you get injured, even if going lightly etc. Its a risk you have to think about before going ahead.   I have enjoyed the sport for a long time and will for a years to come."
MuayThai,3bpv07,Yomadafuku,2,Wed Jul 1 10:50:40 2015 UTC,"I believe timing sparring should be implemented in some classes, no hard hits just pure technique, getting the form right, and action and reaction from your opponents. if beginners go straight to hard sparring then obviously someone will get hurt."
MuayThai,3bpv07,daft_rat,2,Wed Jul 1 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"I think about 2 weeks is enough to be beneficial to most people, but it really depends on the athlete's mentality. That's for free sparring though. I think sparring drills should be woven into class from day 1 because not only does it help learn application, but it makes training a game, and games are fun."
MuayThai,3bpv07,magpie_mcgee,2,Wed Jul 1 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"My experience is similar to yours. This is actually one of the negative aspects of my current gym: They don't require any sort of formal instruction before sparring.  By that I mean we've had guys who walk in, it's their first day, during our intermediate class. Our coach will let him use some gear, and the new guy will join us in sparring. Needless to say this is to no one's benefit: None of the more experienced people will go near them, and the people who get stuck sparring with them end up getting nothing out of it, and the new student gets nothing out of it either.  Last Saturday, I sparred with another new guy. After 10 seconds I just stopped. The guy didn't know how to throw a punch, just walked backwards, balled up, etc. I spent the rest of the round just trying to encourage him to keep his hands up while I basically threw some slow 10% punches. Afterwards, I asked him if he had any prior Martial Arts experience; he had none.  This aspect of how the gym is run bugs me a lot. But the coaches and gym is otherwise great; I've learned a lot and gotten better in general. Just this extremely loose policy with sparring is the downside."
MuayThai,3bpv07,dragon_engine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"I know the feel. In my gym it isn't as loose, however. I had a grasp of the basics already, and the coach felt I was ready.

MuayThai,3bpv07,Dan-gerously,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:25:22 2015 UTC,"What we do in a single class is practice certain things and combinations. Then basics he wears us out. Once were tired We get in pairs and spar, using only what we just went over. Practicing on a bag is one thing. And when the combinations work and you land a hit because they dropped their guard. It feels awesome. You're not trying to knock them out while sparring. You're trying to get your movements right and see where you're messing up, you'll know because it means that they probably landed an open area. Its like hw for muscle memory. In short. Spar often focusing on techniques."

MuayThai,3bi86t,Yomadafuku,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:14:18 2015 UTC,Stray    Thanks :) I started using Lysol after workouts. I guess I'll start using wraps.
MuayThai,3bi86t,Yomadafuku,3,Mon Jun 29 13:16:20 2015 UTC,"If you dont like using wraps, use boxing glove liners, i dont know how absorbent they are but they exist.  Get used to using wraps. You can try the gel glove wraps aswell if you are lazy.   Just remember to air them out outside, dont leave them in your bag. You will be very unpopular lol."
MuayThai,3bi86t,sharked,5,Mon Jun 29 13:36:24 2015 UTC,You should probably be wearing wraps and have a few extra wraps on hand so you don't have to constantly wash them.  I have 4 pairs.  The best way to deal with these kinds of infections is obviously to not get them in the first place.  Products like defense soap are effective.  I also have wet wipes on hand like these.  http://www.wetones.com/Antibacterial.aspx
MuayThai,3bi86t,sharked,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:26:49 2015 UTC,"Havent had any hand injuries yet I suppose, but I think I definitely need to start wearing wraps. So they significantly reduce sweat right? Also do you use the wipes between sessions/after?"
MuayThai,3bi86t,obikins,2,Mon Jun 29 17:15:44 2015 UTC,"They don't reduce sweat.  But they keep your knuckles safe.  If you accidentally punch an elbow or the top of someone's head you'll wish you had those wraps on.  They will probably save your gloves from getting stinky if you keep them clean as well.   Nothing is going to reduce your sweat.  That is just your body type.  You're a sweaty guy, no big deal.    I wipe if I get a cut. I wipe down or just shower right after training.  Also, nothing wrong with brining a towel into training if you are worried about your sweat offending anyone."
MuayThai,3bi86t,misterskinz21,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:32:35 2015 UTC,Ahh got it. So it makes your gloves overall less sweaty? Yeah punching into the elbow actually hurts...
MuayThai,3bi86t,misterskinz21,2,Mon Jun 29 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"Wraps will not only catch all the sweat, but they protect your hands. There are many little bones in your wrist and palm that are prone to breakage. If you're training two hours a day, you need to protect yourself. One broken hand and you're out for months."
MuayThai,3bi86t,CourseHeroMan,2,Mon Jun 29 16:51:24 2015 UTC,"I would recommend wearing wraps. At least they'll absorb most of the sweat.   Also, make sure you clean and air out your gloves after each use. I use Lysol wipes as soon as I'm done wearing the gloves. I also put these in the gloves between sessions. They eliminate odor, remove moisture, and keep my gloves smelling nice. Bacteria thrives in that moist environment so eliminating or minimizing it is key to avoiding infections."
MuayThai,3bi86t,hebug,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:39:58 2015 UTC,So when you wear wraps your hands are significantly less sweaty?

Also downtown chiang Mai is further away so it's harder to lose yourself in the party world. The training was basically only one on one and the trainers and other fighters were all pretty cool. I lived behind the gym in a one room apartment it was pretty cool. Nothing fancy but a ten second walk to the gym.

Really focus on the technique more then anything.   You're recording yourself which is good. Record yourself frequently, and then watch actual Muay Thai fights on youtube channel: GKfromMTA or Muayties  find where your technique and the professionals differ, and you are well on your track to becoming a great fighter, even though you aren't trying to become one :)"

MuayThai,3bboxd,I4gotmypasswords,5,Sun Jun 28 10:15:19 2015 UTC,"The big thing that stood out for me was your footwork. There's a lot that can be said about it but the most obvious was that when moving sideways you're almost crossing your legs (when moving right you're moving your left leg in line with your right leg) really you wanna be moving your right leg first rather than your left.  Keep up the good work though, it's cool that you're opening yourself up to critique on an anonymous posting board."
MuayThai,3bboxd,BloodyWraps,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I am aware that I am opening myself to shitty comments. It is the well meant ones, that I am interested in.   About the footwork: yes, I have noticed that. Also when doing a straight punch, my right foot somehow flies away to the side. Lots of work remains to be done."
MuayThai,3bboxd,riksi,2,Sat Jun 27 18:44:48 2015 UTC,Practice for 5 minutes before class and work on your footwork. I still do that everyday even if I don't have class. I just added it in to my workout routine.
MuayThai,3bboxd,KidGavilan,5,Sat Jun 27 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"Don't lower your hands when you crouch. Protect yourself when doing highkicks. Why no lowkicks ? More hips in everything. When getting highkicked, try to turn and defend it with 2 hands (also by protecting the chin with your shoulder) That body-hook sucks (sorry) protect your chin with shoulder. You crouch too much (knee in face) Crouch only with legs (so you don't bend your back and you're ready to counter when you get up) Middlekick with hips. Whenever you're throwing a punch, protect your chin with the shoulder/arm. Protect yourself when doing highkicks (ex see last highkick). Don't do the body-hook with your arm (use hips+shoulders). Be less tense on the shoulders, so you're ready to fire. When he's kicking you and you raise your leg, sometimes you go back, don't do that. Lean a little forward so you can counter. Practice the boxing steps (especially going backwards)    I would go for 3 times a week if possible. I've tried from 2 to 6 and 2 was too little for me."
MuayThai,3bboxd,poolsofmaroon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:48:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! I will definitely work on everything you mentioned.
MuayThai,3bboxd,poolsofmaroon,6,Sun Jun 28 10:14:37 2015 UTC,"I'll say this, first of all. The fella holding the pads isn't up to scratch. A good pad man goes a long way to helping your technique.  Secondly, I'll just say this - balance. A lot of your issues seem to be caused by being off balance and rushing. There's no rush. Take your time, get your technique right. Remember to stand tall and keep your balance. Don't go too heavy on your front foot when punching or after kicking.  Good works, man. Stick with it :)"
MuayThai,3bboxd,angrynewyawka,2,Sat Jun 27 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"I also notice how unbalanced I am. My stance is bad and I am rushing. I didn't think of taking it slow and focusing on the technique. First thing is balance, though. Thanks!"
MuayThai,3bboxd,one2one2v2,2,Sun Jun 28 10:17:09 2015 UTC,"Just to say that for less than a year, twice a week, you're doing quite well.  There didn't appear to be any knees or elbows thrown, so it looks allot closer to Kickboxing than Muay Thai, and you've quite a long stance which is closer to boxing than MT.   Leg kicks in most martial arts look to protect the groin and return quickly to stance after throwing. In MT you should look to throw kicks with the commitment that if he moves, your momentum will bring you 360.  Start with a much shorter stance, take a small step with your front leg and turn your foot to open your hips, then turn your hips completely and let your leg drag like a whip through. Don't aim to kick the pads, aim to swing the leg to go 360, and you'll notice an increase in power.  This can be tricky to get the balance right at the start, but you'll use less energy in kicks and deliver allot more power."
MuayThai,3bboxd,BroBrahBreh,2,Sat Jun 27 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was definitely focusing on the pads and not the 360 degrees. I also wasn't really concentrating on power. This was another round of many and I was already pretty tired and slow. I will keep the 360 in mind, though!"
MuayThai,3bboxd,JorgFink,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:18:28 2015 UTC,"I did Karate and White Crane Kung fu for bout 5 years each before I took up MT, and the commitment to the kick was one of the big differences.  Watch some youtube videos of Thai fighters and you'll see how quick and powerful it can be.  Best of luck with training!"
MuayThai,3bboxd,HitHard,2,Sun Jun 28 13:05:38 2015 UTC,"I was going to add my 2 cents but everything has already been covered.  I'll only reiterate 2 things that concern me. And by concern, I don't mean it with smugness, I mean that these things concern me because you've been paying money for training for a whole year and your instructor hasn't corrected your very fundamentals.  With that said, the two things that concern me are:  1) Whoever that guy is holding pads is doing you a disservice.  He does not know how to hold pads properly and is giving you a fake distance to work with.  His counter hits aren't doing anything for you because they aren't conditioning you to block/check/evade strikes AND they aren't realistic, so you can't practice slipping and countering.  With this being said, if you can't find someone who actually knows what they're doing on pads, i'd try to politely show him what you want to work with.    2)  As everyone has said - your footwork.  Do it every day in front of a mirror.  Just walk around, don't shadowbox.  Get used to having a more narrow stance and walking around without crossing your feet. Right now you're squatting too deep and are off-balance.    More than anything I really don't think any of your shortcomings are you fault but rather your trainers =(  All in all for a year of MT you look pretty good. Keep up the good work!"
MuayThai,3bboxd,headcoat2013,2,Sun Jun 28 13:50:04 2015 UTC,You should tell the pad holder how people in your weight division only have 1 head and not 2 either side of their centreline.
MuayThai,3bboxd,Pywellman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:09:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have made good points about your footwork. One very specific recommendation I would make: your stance should be a little tighter and a little taller.   One of the best ways to drill this is to have your pad holder throw leg kicks immediately after your throw a punch. The way he's throwing leg kicks at you in the video gives you so much time to defend that even if you're out of position, you can get yourself back into position to defend in time, so you're not really sharpening your defenses because you're only having one part of your stance/balance/attention challenged at once. Have him call a jab and then immediately throw an outside leg kick after. To check that leg kick you have to be in control of your weight and make sure not to have your legs too far apart or with too much weight shifted to the front leg.   Happy training!"

MuayThai,3ba4jo,RoadHouseBob,6,Sat Jun 27 06:11:36 2015 UTC,"Gloves are, alot of times, a personal opinion. Everyone has a favorite brand. Try these on and if they feel comfortable to you then go for it. The inexpensive price may mean the quality is subpar though - be wary. Maybe the stitching is weak, maybe the material used is inferior, maybe the foam is inferior, etc who knows, but those are things I'd wonder. These would probably be OK for bag gloves, however I'd pay up for sparring gloves. I always have 2 different pairs for each anyways. The foam in the gloves will compress over time after bag work - it's always a good idea to get a better quality glove for sparring. It'll keep both you and your partner safe as well as extend the life of your sparring gloves. If you can afford 2 pairs then grab these for bag gloves, then grab a higher quality glove for sparring (twins, fairtex, rival, boon, etc there's plenty to choose from). If one is all you can afford then I'd pass on these and grab a higher end hayabusa glove (if that's the brand you want) or just a higher quality glove of another brand."
MuayThai,3ba4jo,real_polite_canadian,2,Sat Jun 27 07:33:55 2015 UTC,"I don't believe Hyabusa makes for a good sparring glove.

I always tell people to throw down the bit of extra money and try a pair of Top King gloves. Once I did, I never looked back."

MuayThai,3ba4jo,thatsbloodyawful,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:36:55 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of glove I'd use for bag work. You don't need a muay thai style glove specifically, although it is more comfortable for clinching. Depending on how serious your training partners are and your gym, having a bag glove for sparring is not recommended, mostly because that wear and tear on them will open up your partners to scrapes."

MuayThai,3b6wzh,angrynewyawka,2,Fri Jun 26 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"Not exactly related to the video, but has anyone else noticed that Thais pull their shorts up all the time? Can nobody get a pair of trunks that fit over there?"
MuayThai,3b6wzh,NoBudgetBallin,2,Fri Jun 26 18:11:56 2015 UTC,Have you ever fought or sparred?  Your trunks get pulled down.  It's a thing they do to keep the restriction on their movement as low as possible.
MuayThai,3b6wzh,keerin,2,Fri Jun 26 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"I've only been sparring for about 6 weeks now but haven't had a problem with my shorts getting pulled down. They all have drawstrings too, so why not just tie them a little tighter?  Also, I've only noticed it on thai fighters. It doesn't seem like westerners are constantly fidgeting with their shorts."
MuayThai,3b6wzh,LawrenceKenshin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"It's partially that, but also it's a tic. Watch UFC fighters constantly touch their glove to their cheek or eyebrow. If you feel restricted when you block or kick and you get hurt because of it enough times, you get into the unconscious habit of picking them up. Same with the UFC guys. If you are moving from defending a takedown to blocking punches, you need to make sure your guard is up."

MuayThai,3b6wzh,aznednacni,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:42:32 2015 UTC,"Wait who read the article too? It goes from saying that JR loves fighting in China because, for one thing, ""no elbows"" and then by the end the author is saying that his opponent is being encouraged throw elbows by his corner. Am I missing something?"
MuayThai,3b6wzh,indigo_fish_sticks,2,Fri Jun 26 23:19:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, really good point. I never connected the two. JR definitely likes fighting in China because there are (usually) no elbows and the striking is simpler, and the money is very good, but I do also remember thinking that the call for elbows by the corner was going to piss JR off. Perhaps that particular fight was a full MT rules fight but 9 out of 10 times it's K-1. Or maybe I misheard what he was said. Not sure!"
MuayThai,3b6wzh,hacksparrow,2,Sat Jun 27 05:52:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting! Bottom line is I was thinking the same thing, if that poor guy started dropping elbows then JR was going to knock his head off his shoulders with more of the same. Damn he's just so much fun to watch! Always makes me wish I had a bag in my apartment so I can go rip some kicks whenever I want."

MuayThai,3b78iy,Smad3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"I personally like Superpro Samui. It's on the island of Koh Samui, there's a pretty laid back armosphere over there and the camp has pretty good facilities, has very affordable rooms (fan or air con) and it caters to (nak muay) farang.   The manager is Dutch and the head trainer is Charoon Juntra. Most trainers have decent understanding of the Dutch Kickboxing style of fighting since they have lots of Dutch pro fighters over. Superpro samui and Glory/Enfusion are closely connected so lots of Dutch A class fighters visit superpro.  its not a hardcore back to basics ""toilets are a hole in the ground"" style camp and it can get a bit touristy at times but this also means there are usually a lot of outgoing farang that  will end up hanging out and a lot of friendships are made, often with groups of people traveling solo that then hang out besides training, grab food together and stuff.   Edit: just mentioning the Dutch Kickboxing style and the constant presence of K1 style fighters because it means they know how to box a bit better than at some traditional thai style camps. Heck, they sometimes have the Thai National Boxing Team train there because it's known for its good level of boxing."

MuayThai,3b78iy,pseudolus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:08:32 2015 UTC,"I am primarily there to train when it's training time, and enjoy some downtime when it's not. I like the idea of doing stuff on the one day off a week, but I'm not a big party guy. Beaches are nice. I am thinking Phuket - gals are nice to look at but I'm not the type to pay for them. Since it's my first trip over - a bit touristy doesn't bother me, I'll be alone and being around other English speaking travellers will be nice."
MuayThai,3b78iy,timon0711,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:45:49 2015 UTC,"Really, anywhere you go, English speakers won't be far away. Thailand is very geared toward tourism. And even when the Thais don't speak English, they are friendly, and most mean well. Just don't believe anyone who tells you a temple is closed and they'll take you to another one. Just be sensible. You don't need to be overly cautious.  If you do want to do things with your day off, then probably the islands are not a good idea. There's not much to do on the islands, so your Sundays might get boring. But, it's entirely up to you. But I might suggest it's a better idea to choose a home gym in Bangkok, and do a few weekend trips to the beach or up to Chiand Mai in the Mountains for a few days. It's certainly not as pretty to be in Bangkok; you won't get to wake up right on the beach or in the mountains every day, but you'll have more options about seeing the rest of the country on your down time. Just a suggestion. :)  I'm in Pai at the moment, which is really far north. I think it's beautiful up here, the gym I'm at (Charnchai) is always busy and cheerful, and the trainers spend time with everyone every day. Plus it's super cheap. But I've had good experiences at Kiatphontip, Chuwattana, Jitti (though the trainers were a little creepy toward girls) and Sitsongpeenong (though it's expensive beyond belief, because they're accom is modern and new.) I haven't trained on any of the islands, so others I'm sure will be better qualified to speak.  PM me if you want more info or have more questions."
MuayThai,3b78iy,pseudolus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:59:52 2015 UTC,I'm in a similar situation as OP. I'm looking for a beginner's gym that emphasizes good technique. I hear diamond muay thai is really good? I have some boxing experience but want to switch to muay thai instead.

MuayThai,3b78iy,timon0711,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:57:14 2015 UTC,"I suggest then that you stay in Bangkok, and maybe on the weekends go down to Koh Samed and/or Koh Chang.   Do you need creature comforts, or do you want to keep it cheap and cheerful?"

Kiatphontip is a good, genuine gym, good trainers, foreigner friendly, and away from some of the distractions of Bangkok without being so far that you can't do anything on your day off. If you want to be closer in, there are loads of options. I recommend looking at http://www.muaythailand.com for a good overview."

MuayThai,3b6jqd,misterskinz21,20,Fri Jun 26 11:17:21 2015 UTC,"I think starting small is good. In sparring practice last hit. Do not let your opponent hit last in an exchange, even if you have to just tap back. This can take you out of a more passive state of mind, and can also build your confidence because you are ""winning"" exchanges at least in a small way. Get comfortable with this.  Once comfortable with that, practice ""first hit"", separately. Don't let your opponent be first. Beat him (or her) to the punch or kick. It doesn't have to get through, just be first. The same psychological advantages with last hit work with first hit. Get good at being first. Don't try to do too much. Maybe first focus on last hit for some time. Then first hit for a some time. You may be tempted to do both, but it's best if you take them in parts and get comfortable. When you feel pretty good with either, try to combine first hit and last hit. This will have you attempting to finish  and end exchanges. This will create aggression without having to forceably ""tap into"" ideas of aggression, or aggressive states. The effort can guide you. If you can get to beginning and ending exchanges, then start thinking about always hitting in 3s. Do this to force yourself to think in chains. It doesn't matter what you throw (3 jabs, left, right, low-kick, etc), just 3s. If you can start doing this, start realizing that it isn't the first hit that lands, it's the third. Two preparatory hits, the third lands with a little sting. Develop this rhythm.    Some cheats toward developing aggression."

MuayThai,3b6jqd,HonkyMahFah,5,Fri Jun 26 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"If your opponent hits you, hit him twice. After a while, hit him 3 times. If he isn't hitting you at all, hit him 4 times!"
MuayThai,3b6jqd,JorgFink,3,Fri Jun 26 21:04:40 2015 UTC,"Don't take this the wrong way, but 5'7"" and 170lbs isnt' that small. I'm 5'8"" and 150lbs and often fight guys that are 3-4"" taller and about the same weight. I agree with Sylvie on a lot of points and those tactics are important, but only if your striking has a good technical foundation. You're probably being passive because whenever you fight someone you figure out pretty quickly who's faster, and if you know you're slower, you don't feel as confident about...anything. If you have slow, sloppy strikes, the tactics won't be as effective if at all. As a beginner, I would first focus more on your striking technique to build speed, efficiency, and proper form/technique. When working with the heavy bags and Thai pads, focus on technique, form, speed - less about raw, slow, power."
MuayThai,3b6jqd,one2one2v2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:19:47 2015 UTC,"Haha I agree. Not taken the wrong way at all! I'm short-ish but probably within 20lbs of most of the guys I fight with. I'm actually attempting to lose weight because I want to compete in a year or so (nothing too serious, just a local league) and know people my weight generally are a bit taller than I am (plus having a 6pack would be nice lol). I appreciate the advice and will work on technique and form when I go to bag class tomorrow. Thanks!"
MuayThai,3b6jqd,legshot420,2,Sat Jun 27 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"Get comfortable with each of your ranges AKA get unconscience about working tapa tapa tapa light strikes by focusing on range.... so 2 things, work each range and basic dumb shit foot work....  short clinch  elbows and hooks and uppercuts  knees and long clinch (long clinch techniques apply all the way through up until short clinch)  long punches  straight punches  left kick  right kick  Once you get that down just start playing around transitioning (important becomes different ranges are better for different people) and work in your looking for power shots and counters while playing around with range. Note that back foot dictates reach and front foot only because of it's your only base on the floor when you knee/kick with your rear.  I just gave you 2-6+ months of work."
MuayThai,3b5qna,ForkToTheLeft,7,Fri Jun 26 04:47:23 2015 UTC,"Finding openings: this just comes with experience. You try different shit, you see what works, you try to figure out why it works. Vague but accurate. Also, it's rarely the first strike that lands. A lot of times you have to create openings with combinations. Punches (and/or kicks) in bunches. It breaks down defense and creates opportunity.  Range: dude, jab, lead leg kick. These are your range finders. You need to figure out distance of your other strikes relative to those two indicators. Find a heavy bag. Drill.  Closing distance: this is footwork. Step in with the jab. Jab/step, jab/step you're in, drag the rear foot forward throwing the cross, you're in close. Reset, repeat. Also, learn how to take angles. (This probably leans a little more towards the Dutch cross than pure Muay Thai, but the principle is the same, move in behind strikes)  Defense: Repetition. Shit tons and shit tons of repetition.  Defensive reactions (and really offensive ones too) have to get burned into your muscle memory so deeply that the time from the cue (punch coming) the response selection (block) and the action (blocking) is narrowed down to nothing."
MuayThai,3b5qna,Leftover_Rhino,2,Fri Jun 26 07:10:51 2015 UTC,"I see, so most of it is just through experience? With closing the distance, I try to get up close, but I usually am met with a barrage of punches. My coach said to side step while he's throwing those punches. What do you think about that advice?"
MuayThai,3b5qna,Leftover_Rhino,3,Fri Jun 26 07:15:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. Experience. Repetition. It isn't magic, it's a retarded amount of hard work.   The reason you're getting met with a barrage of punches is because their hands aren't busy defending their heads when you move forward. Come in behind offense. Give them something to do other than lob knuckles at your face.  Side-stepping / taking angles, hey it's always good to not be where the other guy is punching. It's footwork. But also, works best when combined with an active jab."
MuayThai,3b5qna,Leftover_Rhino,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:40:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I guess I was too focused on not getting hit, that I actually made it worse for me, in a way."
MuayThai,3b5qna,hayrik,2,Fri Jun 26 07:47:00 2015 UTC,"NP.   You'll get used to getting hit. Once you've gotten hit enough times, you'll be able to control the anxiety of it, manage that adrenaline dump that wrecks your concentration."
MuayThai,3b5qna,one2one2v2,4,Fri Jun 26 07:57:29 2015 UTC,"12 Muay Thai fights (amateur) here with a few championships. I've fought a couple of dudes who are really good at combining the jab cross hook with a right leg kick. It's a common bread and butter move. To defend , cover head (numerous alternatives to that, including counter punching) , check the kick, return a kick . Block punches, check kick, return kick. This requires practice to become used to the rhythm. Do some drills with friends. Good luck!"
MuayThai,3b5qna,one2one2v2,2,Fri Jun 26 07:17:38 2015 UTC,"Woohoo, welcome to the club. There is so much you can work on, I'd work mainly on things you get from your coach and sparring partners when you ask them and maybe 1 thing from online.  Get a pen and pad out. Note sparring experiences, peoples advice, what you notice on others etc. You'll eventually learn how to sort yourself out on what you should work on."
MuayThai,3b5qna,motkd3d,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:40:45 2015 UTC,How is it working out?
MuayThai,3b5qna,bloodyfcknhell,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:22:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I can only say what works for me. I have only trained in Taekwondo, so I can't say anything about kicks below the belt. I guess if you saw a low kick coming in, you could just move your front leg back and that way your rear foot would now be your front foot. Anyways, for my guard I keep my rear hand by my ear (left hand-left ear, vice versa), and I keep the lead hand either parallel to the wall or out about maybe 100-110 degree angle. And I keep my elbows down by my ribs and my shoulders a little high. When I punch, my other hand is on my ear (left-left of course). I have learned to attack by combinations (ABC), and attack by draw (ABD). I'm sure you may understand the combinations one. The draw is just drawing your opponent's guard away and striking somewhere open. I would say that requires a combination. My number one fake is just throwing my rear hand up, towards the edge of the wall and ceiling, and while the opponent is focused on that, I jab them with the lead hand. Works well until they get used to it. Most of the time, especially for the more inexperienced sparrers, they'll throw their hands up to block it. I mainly do that fake as a learning tool. Number two is fake low front kick to the knee or groin or even perhaps the stomach, then twist my hips around for a round kick to the head. Sorry for the long post, and I hope I helped at least a little. I'm sure you'll get more advice as time goes on. Good luck!"
MuayThai,3b5qna,leftkck,3,Fri Jun 26 05:00:53 2015 UTC,"For the low kicks, that's not a good idea. That's a good way to catch a kick to the balls. You're better off just taking the kick to the thigh if you don't react fast enough to check. Someone correct me if I'm wrong- but I've never been taught to switch legs. Against someone good, when they see you switching legs like that, they'll shoot a low kick just to get you to switch and follow up with a spinning strike as you give them the ability to move in close with limited recourse."
MuayThai,3b5qna,motkd3d,2,Fri Jun 26 05:09:52 2015 UTC,"You can shift your front leg out of range. Pretty much try to make their toes hit your leg, then fire a kick back. It's not really a switch though"

But I had decided by that point that I really enjoyed the sport and was committed to it and wanted to wear the common uniform as a sign of respect.   The good part about it is that when it comes time to find a partner for pad drills, you will be more likely to be chosen by a more advanced student for drills, which is invaluable for learning purposes. At least that was my experience once I shifted from basketball shorts to MT shorts.   Now I shamelessly fold my shorts up and the whole nine yards :)"

MuayThai,3b1xli,Alma_Negra,3,Thu Jun 25 08:44:02 2015 UTC,"The impacts on a controlled surface that isn't too hard are an important part of conditioning. If you can't use  aheavy bag, try at least to get in some time on the pads with a partner. Sparring (with shin guards) helps too. And do some strength training. Jump exercises are pretty good. Make sure not to overdo them. Stuff like jumping from knee height is really high intensity. Give yourself enough rest after the training and don't put in too many repetitions.  None of that can really replace the bag, in my opinion. Not even the pads. Ideally the bag, the pads, sparring and strength training should all be part of your weekly routine. But you can at least try to stay in the mix by maintaining the exercises you can do in your current circumstances."
MuayThai,3b1xli,Athrul,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:35:13 2015 UTC,"Mechanical movement produces electrical stimulus on the surface fascia (piezeoelectric effect) of bone which encourages adaptations.

Or, you could take that rattan stick and roll it on your shins instead.  Easiest way though is to kick someone and have him block it over and over. If you don't have a bag, just spar."

MuayThai,3aupe5,this1,4,Tue Jun 23 23:00:03 2015 UTC,Hm? Turning your hip on the hook gives it more power.  I don't see how turning the lower body (and thus punching more correctly) makes you more susceptible to a low kick.
MuayThai,3aupe5,meowthdat,-3,Wed Jun 24 02:00:43 2015 UTC,"Guess it's different school to school.  For the lead hook we get added power from a slight step forward. Always keeping our lead toes pointing slightly out ward.  Hip turn over yes, but not enough so that your front knee turns in."
MuayThai,3aupe5,this1,7,Wed Jun 24 03:23:06 2015 UTC,"But if your toe is pointing out, and your hip is turning in, you don't get very much rotation, and your body works against itself (putting stress on the knee).

Otherwise if you could provide reference to any high level fighters who throw hooks like this, it would go a long way in proving me wrong. Thanks."
MuayThai,3aupe5,meowthdat,-1,Wed Jun 24 04:50:20 2015 UTC,"Copied because I didn't want to type this on my phone again:  Apparently I'm terrible at explaining things, you step forward but because you leg is pointed out at about 30 Ish degrees its in that direction, so when you do turn your hip and foot over, your foot is not turned all the way inward, close to the 90degree inward that he shows. You end up only turning it over maybe half that at most.  Extra thoughts: The step in is also nice in that it allows for a nice tight hook instead of a kind of looking one which can strain the shoulders.  Your foot pivots from facing outward slightly to facing inward slightly.  I guess if your already standing in the pocket in close then yea, you wouldn't throw the hook the way I describe because in the pocket leg kicks are just a but less of a concern..."

He is not qualified to teach (particularly with grappling, his technique is awful) and I think learning bad habits is possibly worse than learning nothing at all when it comes to fighting and self defense - people may develop a false sense of security.   He is the guy who people who don't train watch. There are lots of great instructors online and until you can discern who is worth listening to and who isn't you should leave it alone. Get an instructor and listen to him alone until you gain a bit of perspective. You can't learn watching sloppy technique online"

Dartanian Bagby, one of the Dirty Dozen BJJ guys, had an analogous criticism about Stephen Kesting's BJJ videos.

Years and years of training and teaching. Fazen is a likable kid who has a bit of Muay Thai and Boxing experience and terrible grappling technique. I really don't think you can compare.   The guy who set up Submissions101 is a better comparison. He pretended to be a black belt and, demonstrating sloppy technique, grew THE most popular BJJ channel.

MuayThai,3aoy1g,Flowirbridge,2,Mon Jun 22 20:11:59 2015 UTC,You make a good point. But to be fair Franklin Silva I was 9 years ago and the sport has come a long way in that time. I don't think you'd see that level of incompetence in the clinch in a middleweight title fight today.
MuayThai,3aoy1g,JorgFink,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:40:13 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't see that in a middleweight fight because that's a men's fight.  Women's mma is still very, very, very raw compared to mens."
MuayThai,3aoy1g,mrpopenfresh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"I follow all of mma, including women's 115.  First of all, women's mma is still very very raw compared to the men's.  Because there hasn't been much $$ involved, not all the fighters are well rounded.  Jessica Penne has the best ground game and BJJ at 115, but at the same time, she also has the absolutely hands down worst striking out of all the top 10 at 115, and debatebly, even the top 15.  She is one of the last true ""specialists"" to exist in ""high level"" mma today, but as time goes on, the new generation of female fighters (e.g. Paige van Zant), specialists will die out as overall skill level in the division raises and rounds out.  In men's mma, which is very fleshed out, there are no more true specialists.  All the fighters are fairly well rounded in each aspect.  However, this isn't true for women's mma, which again, is still in it's infancy, something that people who don't follow women's mma fail to understand.  This fight was a total mismatch, one that was made to promote JJ (champion) while keeping her ""safe"" from challengers that could actually take the belt from her.   I won a good deal of $$$ understanding both fighters and the fact that Penne had next to zero chance to win this fight.  I knew she didn't even have a puncher's chance because she can't punch.  Note that Penne has the best ground game, but not the best grappling.  Penne's only chance to win the fight was if it ever went to the ground, but Penne isn't a wrestler nor strong grappler, which basically meant she had zero paths to victory.  I don't believe Penne has ever studied MT, and I've also known she's really weak in the clinch.    To criticize a true specialist is like saying that you could roll with Penne without having a true understanding of the complete situation."
MuayThai,3aoy1g,creatiff,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:25:27 2015 UTC,"I agree. I almost think it's irresponsible to let someone like Penne fight in the UFC with that weak of a standup game. Her kickboxing skills were like someone who trained for a year or so, punches were ridiculously slow and mushy. I think I remember her throwing a kick or two, but they were again, like someone who's trained for a year or two. And if she doesn't have good wrestling or take-downs, can't strike, is fighting someone that isn't going to take you to the ground, then what the heck was her game plan? Hope the other person slips? The earlier fight with Siver (kickboxer) vs Kawajiri (wrestler) where Kawajiri won, because he had good wrestling. It took a lot of effort, but Kawajiri did get Siver to the ground. Similarly, Kawajiri's striking was almost non-existent."

MuayThai,3aodtq,sylviemuay,2,Mon Jun 22 06:39:17 2015 UTC,I recently took six months off thanks to my shoulder doing this annoying thing where it comes out of the socket. I felt like I had virgin shins for the first couple weeks back but after that I stopped noticing it.
MuayThai,3aodtq,JP-Kiwi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:02:50 2015 UTC,"Just a word of warning, I had that shoulder problem, and it eventually took me out of competitive fighting. Once it started happening, everything remained unstable no matter how much time I took off, and a few weeks of hard training would cripple me and force me to take even more time off. Eventually it got to the point that I had crippling pain and weakness. It took both hands to turn a doorknob.  Of course, I don't know your specific injury history, but there seems to be an issue with a relatively small percentage of fighters (maybe 5%) who use joint laxity as a way to increase punching speed. It's not intentional; it's just how their mechanics shake out. If that's the case for you, I'd really recommend taking some time to carefully control your mechanics on a heavy bag with an emphasis on shoulder stability."
MuayThai,3aodtq,Stewthulhu,2,Mon Jun 22 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm pretty aware of how bad it can be. It's an old rugby injury that I've actually had surgery for.

MuayThai,3alh16,one2one2v2,2,Mon Jun 22 05:59:40 2015 UTC,"Judo.   It was something I had done since I was a child. When I started MT as part of MMA training everyone, even the instructor, remarked on how much of a pain in the ass I was to Clinch with - in a good way. It was the only part of MT I took to naturally. The rest I sucked at.   I chalk this up to a judoka's intuitive understanding of balance, body position and manipulation of another via grappling whilst not being prone to manipulations.   Does judo have other aspects that are useless in MT? Of course. Same way elements of MT & BJJ are useless in MMA. But there is carry over and I for one believe that Judo and MT are natural supplements to one another. They basically strengthen the others weakness and cross over in the clinch."

I would have to bread it down it'd be drawing a lot of circles (because it's a lot of circling their left arm circle with your right arm circle and circle their right arm circle with your left arm circle while you circle your base around their base circle to allow you to circle their shoulder circle to circle their hip circle which circles their leg circles forcing them to transfer weight/step to which you retard by foot circle which... that's a basic turn with a trip), so if you can find any books or images that has a lot of circles that would be swell.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKDoZflzVpQ  Foot sweeps/trips are best at the long clinch/parry range.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSfQ9njay7M  Instead of grips you cat-paw yourself onto their bicep, triceps, forearms, hip, shoulders, neck, top of the head. That video above is a good example of that.  Also clinch with the bag, play with weight transference (yours and the bag) and circles about the bag. Hip bumps, knee bumps, foot bumps. When you do it properly, there is not resistance between you and the bag. Also follow the bumps up with strikes since in live they only work if the opponent overcommit, is damage or tired and 1% of the time the timing and technique is perfect."

MuayThai,3aj57w,sweetb00bs,2,Sat Jun 20 21:31:51 2015 UTC,"there was this one exercise that really helped but im not sure theres a name. you start sitting with legs apart then bring one foot in, like a typical seated hamstring stretch, but dont turn toward your extended foot. extend your hips off the ground so youre on your extended legs foot and other legs knee, rotated under you. then sit back down. extend 10-15 times then, while in extended position, place your extended legs knee down and rotate it in and under you while rotating the prior leg(that was supporting on the knee) outward into extended position and repeat. it's not the only exercise, since all others will help, but i find it helps strengthen both quads and hamstrings while stretching the inner thigh and lateral hip muscles"
MuayThai,3aj57w,bloodyfcknhell,2,Sun Jun 21 10:27:31 2015 UTC,"Everyone's mentioning stretching, but don't forget that strength is just as important. Even if you squat, lift regularly, chances are, you're not really working out the muscles you use to actually lift your legs.  One thing I did that helped immensely was going through the kicks very slowly, holding them up as long as I could. This helps build those balancing muscles for control, as well as the muscles you use to lift your legs. It also should help train your muscle memory, so that you're in correct form when you really extend.   Don't forgo your leg workouts, just alter them."
MuayThai,3aj57w,sharked,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:57:28 2015 UTC,dynamic stretching is what you are looking for.
MuayThai,3aj57w,HonkyMahFah,6,Sat Jun 20 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"To build on that -- do a warmup first. Jump rope, shadow boxing, even jumping jacks work well. Then do dynamic stretches. Then class/etc. After all of that, do static stretches using body weight to increase your range of motion. If you do static stretches first, it actually increases your chance of injury. So all those guys on the floor stretching before class -- hurting not helping."
MuayThai,3aivw1,TheBaconThief,8,Sat Jun 20 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"IDK man I think you're overthinking this, but I will say 10 months before you can spar is absolutely ridiculous. I was sparring (lightly of course and with the more experienced guys who knew to hold back) after a few weeks and that was perfectly fine.

MuayThai,3aivw1,rippley,4,Sat Jun 20 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"In terms of getting to sparring, my experience when I started was, that more consistent you are in training, and in attending the classes on one trainer/instructor rather than a bunch of different ones, the sooner they are likely to allow you to advance. Assuming, of course, that you aren't a total spaz."
MuayThai,3aivw1,JorgFink,2,Sat Jun 20 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"Regarding Sitan, do they offer ""all-level classes?"" Most gyms do and have beginner classes that focus only on beginner stuff, and the all-level classes that tries to accommodate both - so you could go to those as well. I don't think you need to be overly concerned about some minimum number of months before you can spar. If you're new to MT, you'll have plenty of work to do outside of sparring and if you learn quickly and are ready to spar before 10 months they'll usually let you if you ask. I would try to find a gym that has both MT and BJJ so at the very least you can maintain your BJJ. I also think it's important for the gym to be near you so you can train 3-4x per week."

One reason why I thought it was a good idea is that it might help with my body attack, something I'm working on in Muay Thai. Also, the chain punches and flurry attacks seem really interesting in terms of finishing off rounds or fights."
MuayThai,3ahorr,Carlos13th,3,Sat Jun 20 11:18:26 2015 UTC,Please let us know how it turns out and how you feel it helps. I would be very curious.
MuayThai,3ahorr,dudeinyogapants,2,Sat Jun 20 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not Sylvie, but I studied Karate for a while before I made the switch.  Technique wise, I found that adding a little bit of Karate technique helps to set up other strikes better.    For example:  I've been playing with using a Karate backfist a lot these days, and I'll use that to set up a body kick.  When I first started using it, it would surprise a lot of the guys in the gym.  It helps to have the flexibility in techniques and be able to effectively use techniques your opponent isn't expecting.   On the flip side, I've got a lot of leftover habits from Karate that I'm still trying to break."
MuayThai,3ahorr,Carlos13th,2,Sat Jun 20 10:04:07 2015 UTC,"Ive found that people from point sparring karate backgroudns are very good at closing the distance and darting in quickly. However can often have bad habits like only ever throwing a punch at a time, touching you rather than hitting you and in very bad cases they automatically doing get into the stance which name I cant remember after a hit.  Kyokushin Karate guys tend to be able to kick you in the head from what feels like way to close for a head kick. But they also have a habit of leaving their hands low because they are not used to face punching.  Is it a lead hand backfist you use? Would you mind breaking the technqiue down in a little more detail? Also mind if I ask what habits you are trying to break. Finally what style was it?  Sorry for all the questions."
MuayThai,3ahorr,dudeinyogapants,3,Sat Jun 20 10:09:49 2015 UTC,"No problem.  Anything to help.  I use a lead hand backfist since it comes out pretty fast if thrown from guard.  But usually I'll set that up with a jab and recoil that into the backfist, both on the same hand and throwing this more from the chest.  This combo leads nicely into most strikes that come from the other side of the body since you have the torque and momentum already behind it.  I usually throw the body kick, leg kick, or even a straight after the backfist.  Usually depends on the situation.  I studied both Shito Ryu and Shotokan styles.  What you said about Karate was spot on.  I find that I'm able to control distance using my speed.   The problem with this is I usually drop my hands to about shoulder level to kinda help control the momentum, and because, like you said, most Karate styles there is no head punching.  I also had the habit of shooting in and only throwing one or two punches.  I'd only recently started breaking that habit.  One of the major habits that I'm still working on breaking is the round kick. Karate we were taught to load the kick and flick it out from the knee.  Way different from Muay Thai and only recently did I start throwing Muay Thai style kicks.  I will still use Karate round kicks to fluster my opponent and control the distance though.  It also took me a while to learn how to throw hooks and uppercuts since we never focused on those.  Overall, I stick mostly to Muay Thai, but I'll switch it up with Karate depending on the situation.  Hope this answers your questions."

How do you think a hammer fist would do in the same situation?  Thank you. I love it when people are able to look at their styles subjectively. Helps everyone.  I prefer the Muay Thai style of kicking but I certainly think there is a place for both. Karate style chambered kickers may have less power but they can be more deceptive and its easier to change targeting after the kick has started."
MuayThai,3ahorr,dudeinyogapants,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"I think the hammer fist would be more of a end of combo type strike, especially if in a competition type setting since theres less padding on that side of the gloves.  It's like an elbow with less power but with more range.  When sparring I'll try to stick to backfists though since we don't spar with headgear, but I'll drill it a lot during shadowboxing.  The combo I've been trying to use with this is a jab>straight>uppercut>hammerfist down.  The hammer fist lands more on the top of the head but the idea is to hopefully stun your opponent enough to follow up with another big strike.   I prefer the Muay Thai style of kicking but I certainly think there is a place for both. Karate style chambered kickers may have less power but they can be more deceptive and its easier to change targeting after the kick has started.   Definitely.  Since I stand south paw, my favorite way to use it is to throw a leg kick by just flicking my front leg at my opponent's.  There's not much power behind it, but it's good for catching people off guard.   Thank you. I love it when people are able to look at their styles subjectively. Helps everyone.   Not a problem.  Anything to help the sport and martial are to grow."

MuayThai,3aa5p3,themuaythaiguy,6,Thu Jun 18 13:11:32 2015 UTC,"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think the fact it's called ""Muay Thai"" is holding it back. I most remember watching a tv show called America's Best Dance Crew, and they did a martial arts theme... one dance groups theme was ""Muay Thai"", they thought it was food.   So, my idea would be for Glory and Lion Fight etc whatever is doing it on a bigger platform with better production to call it kickboxing (at least there's words in there that people will understand and realize, but it's not boxing)... and just incorporate elbows and extended clinch to it. Glory has been proof that stand up only fighting can be successful... but I hate how they limit it.  There shouldn't be this divide between Muay Thai and kickboxing.   There are many factors that led to Ronda Rousey's success:   She had the ""beef"" factor with Miesha Tate.  Both of them were considered attractive women.  Ronda had the all-armbar thing, the bronze medal in olympic judo.  She was actually very, very, very good. A special athlete. Only Cris Cyborg came close to moving the way she does or for a lack of a better phrase ""moved like a man"" or as Lucia Rijker put it when she said ""I don't punch like a man, I punch like a coordinated athlete"".  Platform. Hundreds of thousands of people tune in to watch Ronda on Showtime, a great network with great production.    I see Glory Kickboxing to have continued success. It is doing well on Spike TV, and they just announced they'll be partnering for a MMA/Kickboxing show with Bellator MMA. I don't know what it is. Do the top kickboxers not like elbows and extended clinch? If you're going to be a stand up organization why limit the stand up as well. It's unfortunate, but my outlook for Muay Thai is very gloom until someone comes to the forefront to market it big time to the public masses... the way the Gracies did with jiu jitsu, then Dana/UFC entered with MMA."
MuayThai,3aa5p3,tranypanda,7,Fri Jun 19 08:21:49 2015 UTC,"I think the idea behind Glory is to provide the ""stand and bang"" experience, which is very different than the Muay Thai of Thailand. Sure they could add elbows, but the primary purpose of elbows is not to KO. It's to cut. If you had elbows in any single-elimination tournament promotion you seriously increase the risk of losing a winning fighter by reason of cut. Clinch changes the ""stand and bang"" selling point. Clinch is hard to referee especially in the west - how long you let clinch go has a big effect on whether a clinch fighter will succeed or not. It also is a complete art unto itself in Thailand. Very few westerners really know how to clinch at a high level, and in a tournament style promotion it creates the option to hold on if fatigued. Just some thoughts on elbows and clinch."
MuayThai,3aa5p3,sylviemuay,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:18:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's different in the fights in the Thai fights in Thailand, but from my own viewing of thousands of MMA and other fights that allow elbows... fights being stopped due to cuts via elbow are greatly exaggerated.   Just looking at 2015 UFC events (about 200 fights) there were two fights stopped due to doctor stoppage:   Most recently on April 18 2015 an elbow strike landed on the ground busted open cauliflower ear prompting a stop. Diego Brandao vs. Jimy Hettes January 18 2015 inconclusive if it was an elbow or punches or an accumulation of both in the Uriah Hall vs Ron Stallings match up   And I have zero doubt in my mind if I go through every UFC event that the fights stopped due to cuts via elbow are very, very low. But, it's not Muay Thai and many UFC fighters don't have extensive Muay Thai training, so I can say for certain. Can you think of many examples of fights being stopped from cuts via elbows in Muay Thai? (asking genuinely)   I think for the clinch. At the absolute least they need to allow single and double collar ties. Alistair Overeem used it in his K-1 tenure very nicely and it's just more weapons, so to speak. Now for the over-under clinches... yeah.. it's pretty much non-existent. Ideally, fighters are shoulder bumping out of clinches into punching combinations, throwing elbows, going for dumps etc etc. I'm okay with the subjectivity of this. Let the fighters fight it out in the clinch to start, referee should see if the fighters are actually doing anything, and give them warnings if they aren't active, or appear to be just holding... giving them less and less time to work each time if non-action continues."
MuayThai,3aa5p3,tranypanda,3,Fri Jun 19 11:18:29 2015 UTC,"UFC fighters are generally very un-skilled at delivering elbows. It is common for fights to be stopped via elbow cut in Thailand. I myself have a stitch count of 68 and have had several fights stopped, and women do not throw elbows nearly as frequently as the men. This is the reason for the elbow strike in Muay Thai, to stop fights. Most elbow technique is specifically developed to pop the skin."
MuayThai,3aa5p3,sylviemuay,2,Fri Jun 19 11:29:13 2015 UTC,"That's quite interesting because in recent years there's been many more standing elbows thrown in the UFC, and there's been more KOs/rocking opponents due to elbows than cut stoppages due to elbows. However, part of that might be some landing with more of a forearm smash (upper part of the radius) than the tip of the elbow.   I don't watch a lot of Muay Thai, but again it's really interesting, in Lion Fight I haven't seen a fight get stopped due to cuts via elbows. But, from what I understand they don't host the best fighters."
MuayThai,3aa5p3,tranypanda,3,Fri Jun 19 11:45:23 2015 UTC,"Not to be unkind, but there is very little Muay Thai in the UFC, in terms of complete, high-level techniques. It isn't just the elbows. But yes, there is a lot of forearm smashing. The cutting elbow of Muay Thai is very accurate, with the point, designed to split the skin."
MuayThai,3aa5p3,sylviemuay,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:54:29 2015 UTC,"No, I agree. Striking in MMA for the large majority is under developed.

MuayThai,3aa5p3,tranypanda,2,Fri Jun 19 12:14:15 2015 UTC,hard to say much. Because people don't train elbows much they don't protect against them much either.

MuayThai,3aa5p3,tranypanda,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:17:14 2015 UTC,"Gotta step back into the mind frame of a POTENTIAL fan. In MMA it's easy to understand if people hugging, who's winning. There' one on top smashing the shit out of the other guy. In Thai fighting there's not much clear about it. Even with dumping, they could think that punches half landed don't really could amount to a lot more.  I'm not too sure where to put the following point but here seems relevant enough.  At any given time in a western gym of say 80 people, there may be 2 pro guys, 5 guys who may only have a few interclubs + maybe 1 amateur, 20 are casuals and the rest don't stay longer for 6 months. That's only about 10% of people who understand the dynamics of a fight and +20% who have some understanding."
MuayThai,3aa5p3,one2one2v2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:58:39 2015 UTC,"Those stats are about right. And I fall into the 20% with some understanding.   But of the MMA and UFC fans what percentage of them know anything? You could pick so many other popular sports too.   My question is why do we want it to get bigger? Will that be a good thing? What if it turns into a ""bro"" sport?   My other sport is windsurfing which has in recent decades taken a back seat to kitesurfing. I won't get into which is better and why but the people that windsurf do it because they love it, while kitesurfing has been inundated with dickheads."
MuayThai,3aa5p3,Allways_Wrong,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:48:39 2015 UTC,"There are multiple reasons to be into a sport.   Bigger = more money in the sport thus more of it, and on a personal level more love/recognition for your hard work.  Do you want bigger and better events? Yes. Would you like to get laid because you do your sport? Yes. Would you like to get paid to do something you like doing? Yes. Would you like more opportunities because of it? Yes. Would you like more understanding or respect? Yes. Would you like a tapout wearing guy (a ""bro"" as you call it) that just watched your mate fight high five your group and shout a round of drink? Yes.  Super cool bros, dickheads and flakes will always go to the pop but that's beside the point and is up to the individual club. There are multiple ways to address that but as I said, beyond the point. You want that though, it means there is an increased level of interest.    No reason to segregate people who come to training wearing affliction shirt and cap, they leave by themselves.  Cut being an elitist because it's not progressive, it's nothing but circle jerking, and you'll repel progressive people (which is what is always needed). Those core super cool people will always be there anyway, whether there is any popularity to the sport or not."

MuayThai,3a6tbc,NeverTooManyNarwhals,8,Wed Jun 17 18:01:45 2015 UTC,I'm about a month into Muay Thai    This is the reason. It takes a while to be comfortable with both kicks. It will come with time.
MuayThai,3a6tbc,cobainsdragon,3,Wed Jun 17 20:39:19 2015 UTC,Not uncommon.  You're standing on your dominant leg (left) so you probably have more strength and stability in your right kick.  Using your right leg as a standing leg is probably not as strong or dexterous as your left.  Hence the differential in kicking comfort.
MuayThai,3a6tbc,sharked,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:53:37 2015 UTC,The foot pivot is key to open up your hips to generate power. Your heel should pretty much be facing your opponent at full pivot.
MuayThai,3a6tbc,WeldingHank,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"Hips, hips, hips... About a month in, nothing should feel natural, lol. The hip/body movement in a Muay Thai roundhouse is unlike anything else we ever encounter. Make sure you open your supporting hip (point the foot & knee all the way open) and  lead/push all the way through with the kicking hip. The leg just follows the hip. I know people who have been training for a while and still don't quite have it.  Do kicks for form (not power, don't put any power in it) and after some time you'll start to feel it clicking with your body movement. It's easy to dial up the power with good form, but very difficult to correct bad habits for movement."
MuayThai,3a6tbc,goodguy101,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:30:30 2015 UTC,"When you talk about your right roundhouse, are you talking about throwing it from the orthodox stance, or throwing a switch kick?"

MuayThai,3a54rg,samartpayakaroon4eve,8,Wed Jun 17 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"The biggest improvement in my balance on kicks was when I started developing the Floating Block...the ability to come off the bag or pad and float the block, before returning to the start position.   This forces you to maintain control of the kick in all phase of it's arc, and starts with shadow (don't spin around).   It isn't authoritative, but it was taught to me be a Muay Thai great, Sakmongkol. You can see video of him teaching it to me in this post 15 New Techniques  And I try to explain it to a reader who asks me about it here: The Floating Block.  There are of course lots of ways to kick, but this really altered how I felt about my kick and it gave me much more solid footwork."
MuayThai,3a54rg,sylviemuay,2,Wed Jun 17 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"I've made massive gains doing something similar. Multiple executions/taps/attacks with the same leg always coming back to a check.

MuayThai,3a54rg,imaskingwhy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:29:03 2015 UTC,Just practice what your coach taught you at home and kick heavy bags over and over.   Balance is something most people need to regain wen it comes to stuff like boxing
MuayThai,3a54rg,atomhunter,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:18:57 2015 UTC,"If roundhouse kick balance is your problem, this concept helps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUqsZKYJOho    You gotta figure out your range for yourself  -with practice comes experience. But the idea is important, that you have to step in different directions, place your foot differently depending on the kick, angle of attack, and distance to your opponent.    Try cueing yourself whenever you come off balance, to analyze where you stood, how far you leaned etc.    *in addition: try following these cues - stepping off the center line, angling the step for the kick, stying with your body (center of gravity) more or less above your standing foot, foot position after the kick/moving the leg back, etc. http://muaythaianalyst.com/2015/01/improve-muay-thai-round-kick/"
MuayThai,3a54rg,DasND,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:34:56 2015 UTC,"Listen to your coach, use the stance he is teaching you (you need a foundation on the principals before you break off). Bring yourself to the basic shit to improve it.  Could be a few things. Footwork... Bounce around play with your balance. Could be skipping could be agility ladder drill could be some other drills. Proprioception... See above Park the floor where your feet are, never let them touch the floor elsewhere. Flexibility... If you think conditioning is hard =). Enjoy stretching You're not used to turning your hips over... Practice turning your hips over. Range... Practice different ranges. Close, optimum kicking range, step in kicking range, way to far out kicking range (same as step in range, also good for practising every said above.)  You can easily combine drills as well."
MuayThai,3a54rg,one2one2v2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:27:04 2015 UTC,"I've got similar amount of experience. Some things I always remember with my stance..  -lead foot pointed forward  -back foot 45 degrees out  -scapulae back and upper body somewhat bladed  -bend at the right hip  -a little more weight distro on the back foot  -weight on balls of the feet  -elbows inward no matter what ur hand positioning is  These are all tips I've gotten from my coach, other guys training and fighting, striking podcasts. This isnt maybe a pure MT stance but it's a good striking stance and works well with Thai kicks.  Edit: I've also been told that a proper stance shouldn't necessarily be comfortable from the get-go. It took me some time to get used to it."

MuayThai,3a3il3,peterxgriffin,4,Tue Jun 16 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"I see a few things but if I were your trainer I'd first focus on improving your defense especially your left teep. You're not putting much body into it so you're just kinda Karate front kicking him. A proper teep should knock the guy back 2-3 steps back. I knock guys back that are 50+ lbs heavier than me so weight shouldn't be an issue. I think it's one of the most important techniques to learn properly, creates a perimeter, whenever he gets in, teep him out, let's you control the distance, pace, frustrates them. And it's a good defense for those flurries. A good drill is to teep a swinging ~100lb bag, alternating feet, teep as it comes in, don't spin it, and make good, strong contact. It improves your teep speed and accuracy. And when he tries to copy you and start teeping, catch it and dump him. A stiff jab works in a similar way. Also, I'd work on posting (right hand covers head, left hand posts). It's a good way of blocking punches and pushing them back. Check out this video of Buakaw, master teep session. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXF5eWPV6WQ Re: your offense, it looked more like a boxing match than Muay Thai so train your kicks more, get more comfortable there."
MuayThai,3a3il3,JorgFink,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I can definitely see why you say that, I also noticed that myself...  the weird thing is, usually in sparring my teep is my #1 weapon, and frustrates most of the guys I spar with, but in the fight I felt like I couldn't really pull the trigger on it. I was either out of range or I was too close while he was rushing in.   When you say posting, do you mean like a stiff arm/push kind of thing?  Thanks for the video example too - watched it last night - that was a great fight."
MuayThai,3a3il3,JorgFink,2,Wed Jun 17 15:34:41 2015 UTC,"A good teep should have a wide range. When I get caught in a flurry of punches (close range) I just pull my knee almost all the way to my chest and push him out. Depending on the situation, sometimes it's a lower teep to the gut sometimes I put my foot flat on his chest and stomp him back. Given, I'm flexible, trained TKD for a long, long time. If they're further away I raise my left leg up straight, pivot on my right leg and lean my body back. That has a lot of power and should knock most guys back a couple steps. You have to keep your left foot light so you can throw the teep fast and wait for them to commit and catch them with the teep. You have to establish it early otherwise they don't respect your defense/counters and they'll rush in at will. Here's an example of Buakaw doing the post/guard (whatever you call it). He does it a lot, but this isn't the greatest example since a punch slips through on the first one, but the left post either pushes them out or doesn't let them get any closer: https://youtu.be/KqUcb60Qo2s?t=7m55s Also - do you guys normally spar with those TKD chest guards? That might've messed up your teep. I used to wear those for TKD and would always wear the smallest one allowed, usually 1-2 sizes down."
MuayThai,3a3il3,Yorkshire_Pudden,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I can't wait to try this. I'm actually quite flexible for my size (6'3"", 215) and would accidentally land teeps on sparring partners faces fairly often, idk why I never thought to just stomp the chest from up close.  The chest guard was required for the tournament but normally we only spar with gloves and shinpads, and if it's hard sparring we use headgear, so that was my first time wearing one. It actually was a bit restricting, movement and breathing wise.."
MuayThai,3a3il3,angrynewyawka,2,Thu Jun 18 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"Nice job. It looks like you went a little too hard in the first round and paid for it later on, especially in the third when the other guy was really going for it.   That said, you threw plenty of knees and elbows and you kept going, which is what counts. Good effort man."
MuayThai,3a3il3,angrynewyawka,2,Wed Jun 17 13:20:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks man!  I definitely feel like my wad was blown by about halfway through the second round haha. Everything I threw just felt heavy and slow. I'd never felt my lungs burn quite like that - now I know how much harder I have to push myself in training though haha.  I was happy with the knees too, especially the walk-in knees that I landed, and there was a point in the 2nd round where I hit him with like 3 solid kicks to the body in a row...it sucked wearing that chest protector though, that really took the wind out of any body strikes."
MuayThai,3a3il3,mrepicturtle,2,Wed Jun 17 16:24:41 2015 UTC,"Not a pro or even an amateur fighter by any means, but I would recommend watching a lot of Thai fights (from Thailand).  This looks more like an American Kickboxing match more than anything and I think you could have gained A LOT by being calm, reserving your energy and really cracking that guy with low kicks. Your corner should have noted that because that was the first thing my friend and I were yelling when we saw your fight.  Keep going man! :)  EDIT: SORRY, forgot to add that I thought you looked GREAT out there being your first fight.  Good job man."

Any time I threw punches, he would wall up and just keep his weight on his front leg, not ready to check at all. For some reason I think I only threw 1 leg kick the entire fight.  I don't know why I wasn't chopping away at it - we do it in training all the time. That was even my plan in my head, but as soon as the bell rang, all that went to shit lol. I barely even remember the fight, it's weird seeing it on video now (fight was back in april and I just got the video 2 days ago).  The funny thing is, after our fight, that guy went on to lose his next fight by tko...due to none other than leg kicks haha.  Thanks for your thoughts!"

I work out a lot more than I thai box (sorry, folks), but it really helps me in clinches. Everytime someone managed to get half a plum, I could just get my own half plum in, and just power their head down. It feels pretty awesome.

MuayThai,3a1pas,vandersonmota,2,Tue Jun 16 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"I've heard fighting called a chess game so many times, and thus have continued to play it as such. You're game plan can not be the same for every opponent and also can not be the same for every round or even every minute with that opponent. If you're being read, you need to adjust. One of the easiest ways to do this is to read your opponent and react to them. When you do x technique, how do they react. I've found partners that will defend a technique the same way every time, therefore I can open up their defense by using that technique to set up a second. Obviously veteran fighters are going to have smaller tells, and don't flinch as much, but it's something that's helped me not fall into patterns as easily."
MuayThai,3a1pas,hockeyri4,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"Just building off what /u/hockeyri4 said...I find it much easier to think in terms of single shots instead of combinations.  Just like chess, you don't make a bunch of moves at once, you make a single move and see what your opponent gives you.  For example, you throw your lead jab, instead of throwing the right cross immediately you look and see how your opponent reacts to the jab.  If he tends to dip to his right follow up with a switch/leg kick, if he parries it fake another jab and throw the lead hook, and so on."
MuayThai,3a1pas,jeffskidding,2,Tue Jun 16 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me as if you might be in a state of panic during sparring, which prevents you from opening up your mind, watching your opponent and countering/attacking with new moves.  My suggestion is to consciously say ""ok, this sparring round I will NOT do X""     Secondly, do short spars, 1 minute at a time.  Say you're going to try three different tings, then just keep rotating.  Practice practice practice."
MuayThai,3a1pas,usfdude223,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:30:57 2015 UTC,build off of what you got.    What would you counter with if you opponent adjusts to your predictable pattern?
MuayThai,3a1pas,sharked,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:03:05 2015 UTC,"if your partner knows your go-to tactics, so how they counter, and develop a counter to the counter."
MuayThai,3a1pas,wallysparx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I pick something to focus on during a round. It can be knees, feigns, left kicks. Sometimes I ask my sparring partner to do the same. After the round its fun to see if you could notice what it was."
MuayThai,3a1pas,Shadowplay13,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"All good suggestions here. Only to add, one of the easiest ways to add variation to sparring is to mix in body shots if you don't already. Body shots will distort your opponent. Use them all: jabs, crosses, hooks. It will open up your other more comfortable combos.   Also an easy adjustment is to double or even triple up on strike you already feel good about.   And lastly, you can really emphasize ""last hit"" in sparring, basically turn it into a game of tag when you never finish an exchange as ""it""."
MuayThai,3a13le,crunchjunkie,4,Tue Jun 16 12:06:14 2015 UTC,"You're a bit spoiled for choices.  Within the city itself, Dynamite Muay Thai (Dennis is a completely different flavour of muay thai, another really friendly club vibe).  Other good ones close to the city... Superfight gym with Don Millar (respected name, I'm just mentioning him because he's close to the city). Sor.Jaiphet with Tao (creates overall solid fighters, has a few pros under his wing atm). North Melbourne Muay Thai with Jarhead, Theo and Jojo (very fun environment, Jojo is very counter fighter and has sexy  basic kicks, jarhead's good alround with an awesome clinch, not too sure about Theo but in his fight days was an elephant).  A little further out is Hammer's 24/7 gym which he just pimped out, definitely worth a check.  But if you want to train with the best and are willing to travel... train with Peter Hatton in Pakenham. He has the most champions under his wing."

If you're more kick boxing/boxing orientated, peter hatton or joe nader /powerplay in brunswick (1 suburb across from nth melbourne i think).  Theres a few other muay thai/mma gyms around like Dominance and Absolute.

MuayThai,39yqaj,lobf,3,Mon Jun 15 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"That was a nice head kick in round 3!    Overall I think both your hands were pretty low, they looked slightly below chin level.  Also it looks like when you step in and throw your jab your lead foot increasingly points inwards.  Your opponent could have easily exploited that and thrown leg kicks.  How'd you feel about the fight? It looked like the adrenaline really took over, both of you guys were swinging for the fences."
MuayThai,39yqaj,jeffskidding,2,Mon Jun 15 23:53:24 2015 UTC,"That was a nice head kick in round 3!   Heh, thanks. He kept slipping to his left to avoid the right hand, so I threw up the kick instead. :)   Overall I think both your hands were pretty low, they looked slightly below chin level.    Definitely too low. It's been something I've been trying to work on more in class.    Also it looks like when you step in and throw your jab your lead foot increasingly points inwards. Your opponent could have easily exploited that and thrown leg kicks.   Yeah, I do a lot of plain boxing in class, which leads to the development of habits like a too-sidey stance and turning my foot in on the jab. Not a lot of my sparring partners have great leg kicks so I get away with it a lot, which leads to bad habits. Definitely something on my docket to train out of me.    How'd you feel about the fight? It looked like the adrenaline really took over, both of you guys were swinging for the fences.   I was definitely scared in this one. The whole camp I was told he was 5'6"" which I'm totally fine with. The baddest dude in my gym is a short older guy who used to be some kind of kickboxing champ in the 80s- I've gotten pretty good at hitting him and avoiding retaliation.  Day of the fight I show up and this guy is there as my opponent. I never spar guys taller than me in the gym (I'm 6') and here's this dude who's 6'3"". Not only that, I'm sitting in the waiting room for fighters, and he and his people are talking about his gameplan and they sounded so confident and so sure of themselves and how much his reach would come in to play, it was sapping my own confidence. I started watching Mike Zambedis videos for tips on fighting a taller opponent! Haha.  Not only that, but the other fighter from my gym lost his last couple fights, so the pressure was on me to sort of defend the gym's name. All that plus I hurt my foot early on, which precluded running for this, so I was worried about my gas tank. Then he comes out to the ring dancing and with a bunch of bravado, so I was definitely more nervous than in my last one.   Long story short, yeah, I was not as composed as I could have been. I know I have a big right hand, so I just wanted to hit him with it. Next time gotta be better about controlling my aggression and shit too."
MuayThai,39yqaj,JorgFink,5,Tue Jun 16 00:31:53 2015 UTC,"Well, you did better than the other guy, that's the most important for now. But I would suggest overall working on not using excessive movement to stay more balanced so you can follow up and counter better. When you avoid kicks, move just enough but stay in the pocket and have a counter kick ready. Checking kicks - just raise the leg, no need to push out. Your hands were wide and a little wild, I'd focus on boxing more compact, elbows closer together, not winding up with the hands but use your hips/shoulders. Kicks look a little tight, work on flexibility, relax the leg during the delivery, aim with the knee, but mostly just practice a lot, something like 200+ kicks/leg. Watch a lot of Yodsanklai if you don't already."
MuayThai,39yqaj,JorgFink,2,Tue Jun 16 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you, much appreciated.   How often do you do 200 kicks / leg? I was doing that daily for this camp and it was terrible!"
MuayThai,39yqaj,hockeyri4,2,Tue Jun 16 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"Pretty much most workouts we end up doing +/- 200 kicks/leg, sometimes less, sometimes more. My point was, practice kicking a lot. Do some at full speed, some at half. If your kicks are really fast you can lead out with them, but even slower kicks can be effective if you set them up."
MuayThai,39yqaj,paulisweden,3,Tue Jun 16 08:00:07 2015 UTC,"Just to head you guys off at the pass-  1) I need to keep my opposite hand up. I got bad about that when chasing him down especially.  2) I need to not walk away when I land clean. I really thought he was going to be getting 8 counts for a couple of those, and I thought I could rest for a sec. Oops.   3) Cardio. I hurt my foot running early in the camp and couldn't run for the rest of it. If I had had a bigger gas tank I think it would have been a much quicker fight.   Otherwise lay it on me, guys. Thanks!"
MuayThai,39yqaj,ZboxerOooo,2,Mon Jun 15 21:45:30 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing you can work on is setting up those big strikes better. That guy saw that hanging jab followed by right overhand haymaker coming almost every time. Maybe a small straight flurry or a body kick to drop his guard will give you more success with you power punches. I imagine those big swings left you pretty gassed. So throw some more straights. A right cross might not have the same power as that giant overhand, but the tell is so much smaller, and it's still a great punch if you throw it right."
MuayThai,39w1s1,tranypanda,9,Mon Jun 15 06:58:33 2015 UTC,"yup. always fun to see MMA fighters throwing more elbows. Also, I think gilbert is very adept at Muay Thai. His trainer is Jongsanan ""Woodenman"", who was a muay thai fighter as well."
MuayThai,39w1s1,wizak92,3,Mon Jun 15 07:01:17 2015 UTC,"Jongsanan Woodenman is one of the greatest Thai fighters of all time. His ""elbow fight"" with Sakmongkol is the greatest match I've ever seen. I'm a little disappointed his training hasn't translated very well to Gilbert, but Gil's wrestling-centric game might be better suited for him than Thai style striking.  I trained under Jongsanan for 2 years and that left up-elbow is extremely common in his classes. It's cool to see it used in an MMA match."
MuayThai,39w1s1,m1foley,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:20:34 2015 UTC,"Up until this fight, Gilbert was an above average boxer at best in MMA fights where wrestling/grappling was a big reason for his success"

MuayThai,39w1s1,King_of_lemons,3,Mon Jun 15 15:16:13 2015 UTC,The story goes that the board members of the athletic commission were shown a video of a karate black belt or some such breaking boards with these purported 12 to 6 elbows.  It's complete lunacy when you're allowed to smash your shin into your opponents face while standing up. A head kick would generate so much more force.

This year he's only going to do two classes a week just to keep his fitness/technique ticking over.  Maybe just try to get through one class a week? You could explain your situation to the instructor and just focus on technique without all the conditioning?"

MuayThai,39yw5a,Conura,2,Tue Jun 16 07:06:10 2015 UTC,I would try a fasted class just to see how much it affects your stamina. If you can handle one okay then maybe try and go twice a week to keep everything sharp.   You won't forget anything but what you will lose is stamina.

There should theoretically be a lot of resources for Muay Thai fighters who fight and train during Ramadan as a lot of people in South East Asia are Muslims.  I've Googled it, and this link (http://stronglifts.com/ramadan-weight-lifting-training-build-muscle-lose-fat/) says that cardio or HIIT is very difficult during Ramadan.

I'm defo going to go back after.  However, a couple of years ago, I used to do Kung fu and Ramadan came up so I took a month's break. When I went back, I don't think I forgot much.   Like others have said, do some shadow boxing at home. About an hour before iftar is good I think. I did 40 squats while making iftar yesterday xD   Ramadan Mubarak : )"

The fastest strike has to be as straight line and not a curve, so it has to be the jab. But without context, this isn't very useful information."
MuayThai,39y3tv,meowthdat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"I don't have any data for #1, but from what I've read through the years is most KO's happen when the head spins around, side-to-side. Usually this is from a left-hook or a roundhouse kick to the head. If they don't see the hook coming, they don't tighten up the neck which causes the head to whip side-to-side, smashes the brain into one side, then bouncing off and smashing into the other side. Similarly with a high kick but since it's so much more powerful, just tightening up the neck might not be enough - and even kicks straight into the face can bounce the brain around pretty well. Also, if you kick the temple, there's less protection there so a nice clean shot to the brain.  Re: #2 - I think the fastest attack is the left jab."
MuayThai,39y3tv,JorgFink,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:14:03 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to bet that most KOs in modern Muay Thai come from punches.
