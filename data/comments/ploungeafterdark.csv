ploungeafterdark,3e5vk9,FonsoTheWhitesican,3,Wed Jul 22 06:44:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, $5 per person just to take photos.  How was that movie? Worth seeing?"
ploungeafterdark,3e5vk9,FonsoTheWhitesican,2,Wed Jul 22 06:50:28 2015 UTC,It was pretty nice. Worth seeing
ploungeafterdark,3e5vk9,FonsoTheWhitesican,3,Wed Jul 22 07:01:06 2015 UTC,Well I might just have to go see it soon then. Anything else you do this week?
ploungeafterdark,3e5vk9,obsidiondragonprojec,2,Wed Jul 22 07:09:27 2015 UTC,Nope. Don't do much these days
ploungeafterdark,3e5vk9,obsidiondragonprojec,2,Wed Jul 22 07:38:48 2015 UTC,I agree that it's worth seeing. At least as long as you don't take it too seriously.

ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,Shercock_Holmes,0,Tue Jul 21 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the only ""before"" pic I have violates rule 3, since all i'm  wearing in it is a bra and panties.    I wonder, would swimsuit pics be acceptable here?  Not that I plan on posting one, just musing..."
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,Shercock_Holmes,2,Wed Jul 22 00:23:18 2015 UTC,Gonna get one of them there fitbits?  My phone died this afternoon. RIP Phoney.   I'm going to aggressively tweezer it to see if I can get it to kinda work until my replacement shows up on Thursday.
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,Shercock_Holmes,2,Wed Jul 22 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"I can't afford a fitbit (yet).  Doing things the old fashioned way (walking/running) until I can at least afford a gym membership or cheap treadmill.  Also, that sucks about the phone :(   At least its almost Thursday..."
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,Shercock_Holmes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:17 2015 UTC,It is gone for good and there is no saving it. The replacement might show up tomorrow but I doubt it.  If you have a phone try the Couch to 5k app. It's a great way to ease yourself into running and build endurance. And you must try My Fitness Pal. The search engine lets you search and add any food to your food diary. Just make sure you're accurately reporting your portion sizes.   My favorite c-c-c-combo is the Walmart Equate Diet Shake (Vanilla or Chocolate) paired with a protein bar (Balance Cookie Dough and Mint Choco Chip are my jam). Both have lots of nutritional value and more importantly fill you up like crazy. You eat one of each for a later breakfast/early lunch and you're good until dinner.   If you don't like water get some zero calorie squirt stuff (like Miyo). As long as you limit your caloric intake your weight will fly off. My fitness pal will help you set a number to keep below.  Bam. Good luck!
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,MasterSubLink,2,Wed Jul 22 00:33:19 2015 UTC,"I love MyFitnessPal!  Also, I try to stay away from processed/diet foods like shakes and stuff because they never seem to keep me full and I like knowing exactly what's in my food.  I'm not a ""no processed foods"" snob, but nothing makes me feel better than eating a meal I've cooked myself from scratch, or having some fresh fruit/veggies to snack on.  (That being said, Balance bars are good!)     As long as you limit your caloric intake your weight will fly off.   Not necessarily true, especially when one has a medical condition such as PCOS or other thyroid issues.  But no harm can be done by eating less, as long as its still enough to sustain you.   And thanks!"
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,MasterSubLink,2,Wed Jul 22 00:41:18 2015 UTC,"Ah shoot, I forgot about your PCOS.  As for treadmills make sure to check your local Salvation Army/Goodwill/etc. We got ours from Salvation Army with the plastic still on it for $25 and it was a recent model still selling for about $500 on amazon. It's that time of the year that people's new year resolutions fall through and they get sick of looking at their exercise equipment! I really want an elliptical but every, single time I see one at a thrift it has a SOLD tag already."
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,Xeladner,2,Wed Jul 22 00:45:55 2015 UTC,"Ah shoot, I forgot about your PCOS   Wait, have I talked about this here before or are you one of those guys from that awful skype chat that made me cry?  Also, that's a good idea, I wonder if there are any thrift stores I can drive to around here"
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,Xeladner,2,Wed Jul 22 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure we were talking about it here. Like. Pretty sure. As soon as you mentioned it I went: ""Oh, duh, right. I remember now. No wonder weight loss is more difficult.""   I'm not in any Skype groups with Plounge subscribers."
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,Xeladner,2,Wed Jul 22 00:55:56 2015 UTC,"Good, a lot of the plounge skype chats can get out of hand.    And yeah, its rough, that's why I'm aiming to lose just 35 pounds to start, I really need to lose more like 90."
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,Xeladner,2,Wed Jul 22 01:00:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't know. Are they mostly voice chats? I want to start streaming but I've got a funny voice and it attracted some comments in a TeamSpeak so I'm not sure if I'm cut out for it."
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,Xeladner,2,Wed Jul 22 01:05:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, mostly text chats.  I'm in one (relatively) sane one with /u/fonsothewhitesican , /u/randyrules , /u/theBenger , /u/space4334 , /u/puplecorn , and others"
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,ThatJKmol,2,Wed Jul 22 01:08:28 2015 UTC,What are you kinks/fetishes/whatever and how do they affect your life?
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,ThatJKmol,2,Wed Jul 22 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"Feedism (feeding my partner), and chubby/fat guys, or a guy gaining weight.  They don't really affect my life all that much, but I'm afraid people around here would think me a hypocrite for loving chub on other people when I'm trying to lose my own."
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,TheAsianTroll,2,Wed Jul 22 01:13:02 2015 UTC,First I ever heard of feedism in regards to a male partner.
ploungeafterdark,3e4siy,TheAsianTroll,2,Wed Jul 22 01:18:10 2015 UTC,"True, true.  Its typically a guy feeder and girl feedee, and while I admit I wouldn't mind being fed once inawhile, I definitely couldn't make a lifestyle of it.  That's also why its weird finding a guy who appreciates my body type. Most guys who like fat women also are feeders, or want to see me gain more weight.  Its a rough situation."

There are two questions I have:   Why is my friend gay for me when I look like an orang utan and there's tons of other hot males/females out there?

ploungeafterdark,3dx2ux,obsidiondragonprojec,2,Mon Jul 20 07:09:52 2015 UTC,"In that case, the only thing my girlfriend's done that's made me dingle tingle so far is when we snuggle virtually through chatting and she gets romantic. also, I sometimes get aroused just by seeing her."

ploungeafterdark,3dujjs,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,4,Mon Jul 20 02:12:04 2015 UTC,Good to know :)
ploungeafterdark,3dujjs,MasqueRaccoon,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:42 2015 UTC,Bit of a slow day for comments! Probably doesn't help that we've hit a hiatus for a while.  What's the last movie you saw? How was it?
ploungeafterdark,3dujjs,MasqueRaccoon,2,Sun Jul 19 23:37:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly I expected it, because I'm a bit of a lurker/no name.  The last movie I saw would be Fury and it was pretty good. I really liked a specific scene were it was several American tank crews vs a German Tiger tank. I know the movie wasn't going for ""realistic war view"" but it did kinda put emphasis on how much stronger the armor on a Tiger was compared to ours."
ploungeafterdark,3dujjs,chaosmarine92,2,Sun Jul 19 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's also that it's Sunday, so there's not as many people hanging around.  Ooh, I've heard Fury is good. Been meaning to watch it, it's been a while since I've seen a good movie."
ploungeafterdark,3dujjs,chaosmarine92,2,Sun Jul 19 23:52:53 2015 UTC,"Favorite ice cream, past-time, and sexual fantasy?"
ploungeafterdark,3dujjs,chaosmarine92,3,Mon Jul 20 00:45:00 2015 UTC,"Favorite ice cream is Fudge Brownie. Had some really good coffee flavor once but I don't know what it was called/where to get it, otherwise I'd say that.  My favorite past time(s) are Osu!(Rhythm Game), watching programming live streams or seeing experts in fields(doesn't really matter, usually computer/engineer related) just kinda...do their thing.  Sexual fantasy is being being fucked/face fucked as a pet. I love collars so that kinda contributes as well."
ploungeafterdark,3dujjs,Fatal_Taco,2,Mon Jul 20 01:05:37 2015 UTC,"Eww, both of those sound not delicious to me.   Programmer live streams is a thing now?  I can see the appeal, sounds hawt."
ploungeafterdark,3dujjs,sinnerdizzle,2,Mon Jul 20 01:27:52 2015 UTC,"I love coffee, be it ""actual"" coffee or as my father use to call it ""Dessert coffee""(starbucks flavors, mcdonalds anything), so a flavor of ice cream for it is amazing.   Programmer live streams have been a thing as long as twitch has(and its precursors). Like, watching an Indie team program(Vlambear does it, Wanderlust Rebirth guys do it, community modders, etc) is interesting to me."
ploungeafterdark,3dujjs,sinnerdizzle,2,Mon Jul 20 01:37:40 2015 UTC,"I've always preferred tea myself. I can drink coffee but its not my goto drink. So ice cream of it isn't on my list of yums. And any chocolatey type of ice cream is just nasty to me.  Huh, had no idea. Weird."
ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,Fatal_Taco,4,Sun Jul 19 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of annoyed with the ""everything is a fetish"" attitude that can be seen on the internet sometimes. Furry things are designed to have all the basic things that get humans turned on plus some extra stuff for specific people. If a straight guy is turned on by a human shaped female creature that's showing off it's assets then thats not weird even if that creature has some fur on it. No hate going to you FT it's just something that annoys me a little."
ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,TotallyNotASlinky,2,Sun Jul 19 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"Technically, none of these are even ""fetishes."" They're kinks, or just turn-ons. A sexual fetish is when you find sexual arousal in non-human objects. The more colloquial use of ""fetish"" for ""whatever turns me on"" is like using the word ""gourmet"" to describe ""anything I enjoy eating.""    Now you can be even more annoyed by misused terminology!"
ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,MasqueRaccoon,3,Mon Jul 20 01:05:42 2015 UTC,"a sexual focus on a nonliving object or nongenital body part   Non-genital body part.... good, so I'm still factually accurate in calling my fetish a fetish."
ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,2,Mon Jul 20 01:32:20 2015 UTC,"Curiously, non-genital body parts (partialism) were broken out of fetishism in DSM-III-R, and only merged back in 2013 with DSM-V."
ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,MasqueRaccoon,3,Mon Jul 20 01:38:06 2015 UTC,You know a lot about this stuff. Cool!  But yeah: my two fetishes can be summed up as food (feedism) and tummies (self explanatory).  Both fall within the definition as given.  I win.
ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,4,Mon Jul 20 01:44:02 2015 UTC,"As the saying goes, ""I know just enough to be dangerous!"" I got interested in sexuality and fetishes from my exposure to the furry fandom back in the 90s, and did some reading.  Tummies certainly fall into partialism fetish. Feeding is a bit trickier, because you're not sexually fixated on the food itself, but on the act of feeding. That probably falls more into the category of a kink, though extreme versions could be classed as a paraphilia."
ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,MasqueRaccoon,2,Mon Jul 20 02:06:48 2015 UTC,Looks like you know your stuff. I am impressed.
ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,2,Mon Jul 20 02:13:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, I know how to fake it. And how to look up stuff when I'm curious."

ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,PM_me_ur_RainbowDash,3,Mon Jul 20 02:57:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying idk if you actually like chicks IRL."
ploungeafterdark,3duhpb,Tree_Butt,2,Mon Jul 20 03:08:14 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, well sorry if I kinda annoy you. On the internet, quite a lot of individuals regard Furry Yiff Content as a fetish, which is how I assumed it was a fetish in the first place"

ploungeafterdark,3dsra2,Gluttony4,4,Sun Jul 19 03:18:10 2015 UTC,"No, she's mentioned in the first movie too.  It's a bit of a rapid-fire-speech moment where EQG-Pinkie asks Equestria-Twilight if she has a twin sister who lives in the city. It's basically an implication that EQG-Twilight doesn't live in the same town as the rest of them (It's a parallel to how pony Twilight used to live in Canterlot when the rest of the 5 lived in ponyville).   Living in a different city, she presumably goes to a different school (which was later confirmed), and thus had no reason to be around for the first two movies."

It's about liking someone else so much that you are willing to risk anything to see them happy, even if it means pain or unhappiness for you."
