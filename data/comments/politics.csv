politics,3e1riz,yellowpage09,4,Tue Jul 21 08:02:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a Sanders supporter and donor, but the only thing we do by flooding /r/politics with Bernie fluff pieces is to cause others to tune it out, anger people who may have voted for him, and dilute any articles that actually have substance. Bombarding the general (reddit) public with Bernie circle jerk material is like that one Facebook friend who spans their wall with self-supporting political sound bites, eventually you just unfollow or hide them, and now you've tuned out to their bombardment. If Sanders supporters continue on this path for the next six to twelve months, we will just disenfranchise the group we are trying to attract. ""Bernie's key demographic likes his policies"" doesn't help the cause, in my opinion. The article about his policy for $15 minimum wage, however is good because it sparks a discussion, which is really what we want to do. So I ask, for the sake of supporting Bernie, Downvote Sanders articles which don't have any substance, and save /r/politics for articles which actually promote a meaningful political conversion. Thank you for your consideration."

That being said, it's just that: survival. You aren't building a future or going anywhere, you're just trying to make it to the next day. It's a rather shitty existence.  Edit to add: It also depends on what part of the country you live in. That said, I know people who do this in SoCal, and it's relatively expensive to live here.

Many teens, who would otherwise be able to land a fast food job easily, are now finding themselves PUSHED OUT of the industry, due to ""college educated"" adults who can't find work elsewhere.  We have an over-abundance of ""college educated"" professionals, who can't find a job in their field, turning to literally ANYWHERE ELSE to find work to support themselves (and sometimes their families). This is a multifaceted problem that can't just be fixed by raising minimum wage. Honestly, the whole ""raise the minimum wage"" thing is extremely short-sighted.

Problem with that is, we're not allowed to get overtime, especially if your part time.

One Friday I was supposed to close with another guy. Busiest night I'd ever seen and I had to leave him by himself 4 hrs early.

Thing is, HR was pulling some shit and our production staff was going from a couple hours of OT a week to 15 minutes of OT per week,even though they were staying after for 30 minutes or so every so often.

And yet those people of the past could live off of a single income, buy a house, cars put their kids through college. Its crazy to me how much people actively hold back other people, the way we look down on those who make less than us and attribute all of our successes to busting our asses and anyone who makes less doesn't deserve what we have. Instead we need to raise the bottom up for our successes are nothing if we don't allow others to succeed in our wake."

Gasoline?  ~$60 a week if you gas up only once that week. $2130.  A paycheck gets taxes taken out of it too so it brings it down to ~$2200 (instead of $2400).  We're not taking car insurance, car registration...etc into account and other purchases.  Still minimum wage is around $9 an hour so people have roommates and/or work two jobs.  Having the minimum wage at $15 allows a couple to some day buy a house and enjoy their time off instead of one or both working two jobs to make ends meet.  $15 is still probably not on par with inflation, but it is definitely a right step to bolstering the lower-middle to middle-class people and families."

To go to school for a few years and only make marginally more than someone who can flip burgers with half a day of training?  Bullshit.  (I'm not trying to knock those who work these low skill jobs, but that is exactly what they are...low skill).  Just take a look at this chart for median teacher salary per state - yes the figures are from 2012-2013, so there might be some increase, but let's not kid ourselves that there has been a huge jump in salary in the past 2-3 years.    $15 X 40hr X 52 wk = $31,200 a year.    So this means that a person working at McDonalds for life deserves to make more than teachers do in some states?  I agree that the minimum wage needs to be raised, however, I think that by doing so - you need to pay the people who have furthered themselves through education or garnering skills appropriately.

You have no real experience to speak of, and even in STEM fields people with degrees and no experience are dime a dozen.  This means you are making the lowest amount you will make in your field, and you can only really go up as you gain more experience (unless you get fired and never work again). The McJob worker will not; they will remain at $15 an hour probably for the next decade if the past has been any indicator.   On top of that, you also have benefits which would demolish anything some McJob worker will ever see. The total benefits package alone, unless you work at a really crappy job, would easily make up for another few dollars an hour on your salary.  All together, you will still be much better off than a McDonalds worker. Not AS better, but is it really so necessary that you keep the distance between yourself and the McPlebians at the exact same amount? If this bill passes, I have no intention of asking for a raise, and if I do it won't be for some substantial amount.   Plus, you won't have to deal with angry people at the cash register (I assume?).

politics,3dz8xd,Shatteredreality,68,Mon Jul 20 23:29:37 2015 UTC,"That map frustrates me when it comes to this discussion.   I don't understand why we keep comparing the minimum wage to the amount it would cost to get a two-bedroom apartment. I really wish everyone could afford a large space to live in but the truth is two bedrooms is a luxury (assuming you are single or living with someone you are comfortable sharing a room with).   I want the minimum wage to increase but realistically we should ensure that every working adult who has a full time job should be able to afford a place to live, not compare it to a 2-bedroom  apartment. For a single person a studio or a 1-bedroom should be more than adequate and should be more what is expected of the minimum wage.   When talking about the minimum we should pay someone we should really be comparing it to the minimum that is needed to get by (and I say this as someone who is living in a 1-bedroom apartment, a 2-bedroom would be very nice but it's not a necessity).   That all having been said $15/hour is not extreme. In some places like LA it's still not viable without help where in other places it may not be extreme but it's livable to be sure (see smaller towns where you can find 2 br apartments for less that 1k/month)"

The average hourly wage we pay is between $9-11 but our payroll is by far the largest expense we have, other than our loan.

politics,3dz8xd,buzz1089,7,Tue Jul 21 01:13:21 2015 UTC,"Raising the minimum wage is trying to combat a larger issue that is harder to specifically address, that of companies not increasing what they pay employees relative to inflation and the success of the company as a whole.  I'll use wal-mart as an example as I worked there for a couple years in the past and they are a very large, corporate company. When I started there, the local minimum wage was around $7.50 an hour. The minimum wage they paid an employee was closer to $8.00 an hour. But after 2 years, local minimum wage was up to $7.75 but the minimum they paid was still less than $8.00, even though the revenue of the company as a whole had increased and there was some inflation, albeit not much.  That is the larger issue, that large companies like Wal-mart and McDonald's continue to increase their revenue without the workers at the bottom seeing any benefit from it. This just helps increase the wage gap. Raising the minimum wage is an attempt to force companies to close that gap and stop treating employees at the bottom as worthless and easily replaceable. It may not be the best method, but it is one of the easier ones to try for. It's much easier than trying to force each individual company to raise EVERY employees pay relative to the overall success of the company as they should be doing already, but are not."

politics,3dz8xd,TheAstralGoat,28,Tue Jul 21 01:53:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's inflation.   example: Someone who worked in a job for 15 years eventually gets his 20 dollar wage, and when he started it was 10. Then suddenly, newcomers come in already making what he worked very hard to get (15 dollar wage).   He will most likely ask for a raise, then the person running the company also wants to keep the wages proportionate. (He doesn't want employees making close to what he does). To be able to do this without losing profits, they just increase the price of goods, thus, higher minimum wage does nothing.  This applies to the small businesses as well."

The average household of a minimum wage worker is earning almost $50K annually. In 2011, nearly 80% of minimum wage workers were not in poverty.

The only issue would be the expansion of the budget deficit from cutting tax money out of the balance."
politics,3dz8xd,Worf65,5,Mon Jul 20 22:45:15 2015 UTC,"Somehow this doesn't seem quite right... it would take 5-6 minimum wage workers working the amount of hours they say are being worked (24 per week) to get that household income. My guess would be that this is showing that the average minimum wage worker lives with someone else who makes a bit more money, probably their parents, possibly a bunch of roommates. This data just seems a little odd to me. Anyone trying to get by on their own at minimum wage would almost certainly be in poverty, which is probably the reason for a push to raise it.    Edit: another interesting thing to look at is how many people would get raises because of an increase to the minimum wage. I know where I live quite a few places pay just above minimum wage (7.50 is very common even for teenagers at fast food jobs, as is 8.00). These people are never counted as ""making minimum wage"" even though an increase would give them a raise. This category, at least around here seems to significantly outnumber those who actually make minimum wage."
politics,3dz8xd,samc131,73,Mon Jul 20 22:18:09 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the sentiment expressed with the EITC, however in practice it does not always work this way. While it does require the recipient to be working, it features arbitrary cutoff points that puts certain people in positions where they may be hurt financially by taking a higher paying job. This is of course counter to the behavior we should be encouraging.  Also the EITC is scaled based on the number of children you have. This is how many of our tax credits work, which in my honest opinion is quite unfortunate.  Otherwise, the points that you made about the minimum wage I agree with. An influx of jobs that pay above minimum wage is the only way to reduce the poverty level of those who do actually work."

politics,3dz8xd,jdaar,31,Tue Jul 21 00:12:41 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that a lot of people earning minimum wage, students (college and high school), are considered part of a household whose income is middle-class. Plus you have families where both parents work 2 30-hour jobs for a total of 120 hours.  Not ideal or preferable, but possible and probably common."
politics,3dz8xd,EconMan,24,Mon Jul 20 23:30:56 2015 UTC,"If we actually want to reduce poverty, we should look to expand the EITC[5] , which gives incentives to work and does not put negative stress on businesses.   We should indeed. Ironically, I think Paul Krugman said it best when he talked about the actual issue at play for some people.  ""Now to me, at least, the obvious question is, why take this route? Why increase the cost of labor to employers so sharply, which--Card/Krueger notwithstanding--must pose a significant risk of pricing some workers out of the market, in order to give those workers so little extra income? Why not give them the money directly, say, via an increase in the tax credit?  In short, what the living wage is really about is not living standards, or even economics, but morality. Its advocates are basically opposed to the idea that wages are a market price--determined by supply and demand, the same as the price of apples or coal. And it is for that reason, rather than the practical details, that the broader political movement of which the demand for a living wage is the leading edge is ultimately doomed to failure: For the amorality of the market economy is part of its essence, and cannot be legislated away."""

If they pay double to their employees that will probably be a 25% increase in operating costs (round number that should be in the ball park for a lot of industries with minimal wage).

Virginia is an employment-at-will state; this means the employer may terminate any employee at any time, for any reason, or for no reason.   What? The law says ""right to work"". Why is Virginia an ""at will state""? The answer is because there is absolutely zero difference between the two laws. In the end they both mean that you can be fired for no reason at all."

Your first link is Virginia's ""Right to Work"" statute, which says:   It is hereby declared to be the public policy of Virginia that the right of persons to work shall not be denied or abridged on account of membership or nonmembership in any labor union or labor organization.... 40.1-60. Employers not to require employees to become or remain members of union. -- No person shall be required by an employer to become or remain a member of any labor union or labor organization** as a condition of employment** or continuation of employment by such employer. (Enacted 1947; amended 1970.)   In other words, exactly what I said: the ""right-to-work"" statute means an employer can't operate a ""closed shop"" and require all employees to be unionized. You won't find the terms ""at-will employment"" in that statute because that isn't Virginia's ""at-will employment"" statute.  Your second link certainly does state that Virginia is an at-will employment state, which it is, but it doesn't refer to the right-to-work statute in support of that.    In the end they both mean that you can be fired for no reason at all.   No, only one of them does. Read the statute you linked - you won't find any terms relating to being fired. That's because ""right-to-work"" covers the degree to which you can be coerced to participate in unions. At-will employment is the other thing."

They are working to tear down and fix the same crap from the past ownership. It is taking time to repair but you can actually see positive changes taking place. Of course some new polices are not as friendly to anyone as the past polices were but I guess you have to give some if you want the buddy/family system gone."

So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “N-----, n-----.”""  Atwater, for those who don't know, was a Nixon campaign strategist and former GOP chairman.

politics,3dzvmy,placeo_effect,57,Tue Jul 21 03:24:10 2015 UTC,"Karl Rove: Known in Gay Circles as 'Miss Piggy'   In Washington's more 'discreet' gay bars Karl Rove is well-known as a frequent visitor. Witty gays have given him the nickname 'Miss Piggy, after the character on 'The Muppets'. Whether this refers to his appearance ['the doughboy'] or his sexual preferences is open to speculation.   http://www.lawschooldiscussion.org/index.php?topic=3003759.25;wap2   Walter Storch, editor of the Barnes Review News reported three weeks ago that ""Karl Rove was seen by one of my people entering a private homosexual orgy at a five-star Washington hotel over the Mid-Atlantic Leather (MAL) weekend last year."" [2004] A Barnes reporter told Storch that ""Karl greatly enjoyed the supervision of a certain hairy 350-lb. Leather Dominator who had won the Miss Virginia Daddy Bear title at the MAL festivities."" Storch wrote, ""Karl used to hang out a JR's, which is on 17th between P&S streets, before he became so well-known. This is a respectable gay bar for discreet people ...,"" adding, ""there is an expensive apartment ... over near Dupont Circle that certain powerful senators take turns visiting with their pickups.""   With gay RNC chairman Ken Mehlman and the latest outing of fake reporter Jeff Gannon, a GOPUSA/ Talon News shill, the issue of Karl Rove has come out as well, so to speak. ""The thing I never understood about Karl Rove,"" writes Al Martin, author of The Conspirators: Secrets of an Iran Contra Insider, ""is that he's not married, and I used to know this guy in the mid-1980s. He doesn't look all that much different now than he did 20 years ago. But here's a guy that looks like a cross between Humpty Dumpty and the Pillsbury Doughboy. I never saw him with a woman. He was never friendly with any women and never seemed to have any girlfriends or go out on a date or anything.""   Martin continues his recollections -- ""Karl would always hang around at the Rooftop Bar at the Mayflower, which is directly across the street from the White House where all the DOJ pretty boys, as they used to call them, would go after work for a drink. And that's always where Karl was ... It's odd that this guy has never married. He's a bachelor. Usually in Bushonian circles, particularly when you're close to the religious right, which Karl is and raises money from them, it's almost obligatory that you be married and have kids.   In his column called ""The Fairy Godmother Rules: Karl Rove and the Gay Republican Mafia,"" political analyst Al Martin examines the confluence of high ranking gay Republicans and their control of the Republican Party, especially when the Religious Right must be aware of this irony, as they continue to support the Bush-Cheney Regime. ""Fake journalist Jeff Gannon was outed last week,"" Martin writes. ""'Jeff Gannon' is not his real name, yet he was able to get inside the White house press pool. How's that for 'security'? Being a fake Bushonian journalist shill means never having to say you're sorry. ""And so we have another story of another gay Republican so-called journalist, just like Armstrong Williams. Gannon, who real name is J.D. Guckert, finally admitted that Gannon wasn't his real name and that Talon News Service was nothing more than a shill for another Bush front called GOPUSA.""   What's important about all this is that it was nothing more than a shill organization for GeorgeBush.com, which is financed from a Texas-based Republican Christian group associated with Karl Rove. We are finally learning how extensive this is now. He said that there are hundreds of bogus news services and bogus newsletters that have been organized around GeorgeBush.com. In fact, he also noted how well coordinated Karl Rove (now the new Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove) has gotten it so there is now an entire industry to subvert news and to spin it. The story gets even more intriguing when it becomes clear that ""the White House credentialized fake news reporter Jeff Gannon from fake news agency Talon News and this was cited by the Washington Post as having the only access to the internal CIA memo that names Joseph Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, as a covert agent. Gannon referred to the memo, to which no other news outlet had access, according to the Post."" Supposedly Gannon has also been subpoenaed by the Federal Grand Jury looking into the Plame outing, though Gannon himself denies it. Will there be a special investigation of Karl Rove and ""Jeff Gannon"" regarding the ""outing"" of CIA agent Valerie Plame?"

To avoid the incoming fire, I repeatedly swam under water as long as I could hold my breath, attempting to make it to the north bank of the river. I thought I would die right there. The odds were against me avoiding the incoming fire and, even if I made it out of the river, I thought I'd be captured and executed.

Kerry's boat ran up to me in the water, bow on, and I was able to climb up a cargo net to the lip of the deck. But, because I was nearly upside down, I couldn't make it over the edge of the deck. This left me hanging out in the open, a perfect target. John, already wounded by the explosion that threw me off his boat, came out onto the bow, exposing himself to the fire directed at us from the jungle, and pulled me aboard.  For his actions that day, I recommended John for the Silver Star, our country's third highest award for bravery under fire. I learned only this past January that the Navy awarded John the Bronze Star with Combat V for his valor. The citation for this award, signed by the Commander of U.S. Naval Forces, Vietnam, Vice Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, read, 'Lieutenant (junior grade) Kerry's calmness, professionalism and great personal courage under fire were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.' To this day I am grateful to John Kerry for saving my life. And to this day I still believe that he deserved the Silver Star for his courage.  Now, 35 years after the fact, some Republican-financed Swift Boat Veterans for Bush are suddenly lying about John Kerry's service in Vietnam; they are calling him a traitor because he spoke out against the Nixon administration's failed policies in Vietnam. Some of these Republican-sponsored veterans are the same ones who spoke out against John at the behest of the Nixon administration in 1971. But this time their attacks are more vicious, their lies cut deep and are directed not just at John Kerry, but at me and each of his crewmates as well. This hate-filled ad asserts that I was not under fire; it questions my words and Navy records. This smear campaign has been launched by people without decency, people who don't understand the bond of those who serve in combat.  Does this strategy of attacking combat Vietnam veterans sound familiar? In 2000, a similar Republican smear campaign was launched against Sen. McCain. In fact, the very same communications group, Spaeth Communications, that placed ads against John McCain in 2000 is involved in these vicious attacks against John Kerry. Texas Republican donors with close ties to George W. Bush and Karl Rove crafted this ""dishonest and dishonorable"" ad. Their new charges are false; their stories are fabricated, made up by people who did not serve with Kerry in Vietnam. They insult and defame all of us who served in Vietnam.  ...Swift Boat Veterans for Bush should hang their heads in shame.""  http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110005460"

Republicans would love another divisive partisan contest to bring back the old national divide that keeps them in power. And they have been planning on a Hillary run for the White House for a long, long time. We threw them a big curve ball with Barack. They will be in deep kimchi (lots of trouble) if Democrats nominate Senator Bernie.   Right, because Republicans have embraced Obama without resorting to divisive partisanship. And they'd surely do the same for Sanders if he were the candidate.   The idea that Democrats should pick their nominee based on the mean things Republicans might say about them is silly. They called Clinton a rapist and a murderer, they called Kerry a yellow-bellied traitor, and they called Obama an America-hating Kenyan Muslim.

politics,3dxipt,SubaruBirri,21,Mon Jul 20 16:40:15 2015 UTC,"It isn't a matter of what they play. It's how the play hits. The GOP's job (beyond supporting their candidate) is to develop and deploy the strongest arguments against the other candidate that they can muster. Sometimes the strongest argument they have is really strong, and other times the strongest argument they have isn't that strong at all. Sometimes the candidate they're up against is particularly vulnerable, and sometimes they aren't. They had a mediocre argument against Kerry (with Swiftboat Vets for Truth), but Kerry was extremely vulnerable there, as it turned out. They had a killer set of arguments against Obama, but as a candidate he wasn't really vulnerable to any of them (none had ""legs"" in mainstream political culture).  The problem is that, where Sanders is concerned, they have a mind-blowingly strong argument against him (socialism), and the candidate is very, very vulnerable (he is a self-labeled socialist). The best he can hope for is to ""own"" the label, but to be successful in that tactic he would have to convince the country that socialism is acceptable - something that it has violently resisted for many, many years. On top of that, the election cycle is the worst possible time to try and alter public perception in any meaningful way, because your opponent is a) hyper vigilant about responding to your political moves, and b) unusually well-funded. The time to alter public perception is between election cycles, when the opposition is focused on other things and is conserving their war chest for the election cycle. It's clear from opinion polling that efforts to make socialism palatable to America over the last six years have been unsuccessful - in a recent poll, fully 53% of the country stated they would absolutely not vote for a socialist no matter how otherwise qualified he might be (for context's sake, more people were outright opposed to a socialist President than an atheist President or even a Muslim President).  It's unfortunate, but we can't win with Sanders as a candidate. And we really, really need to win."
politics,3dxipt,dannager,34,Mon Jul 20 17:12:40 2015 UTC,The problem with many Americans' view of socialism is that they tend to confuse socialism with Communism whereas in reality a good image of socialism (with some capitalism as well) would be the Scandinavian countries.

Yes, with fewer fundamental problems than a truly capitalistic system.  Desperation is a defining characteristic in American culture.  Medical problem?  Desperate financial hardship followed by bankruptcy.  Economic contraction?  Job loss followed by less money for food.  Redistribution through programmes like food stamps, social security, Affordable Care Act, etc. help the most needy with a fundamental compact unconsciously entered into between the populace and the government to take the desperation out of the lives of those who are most vulnerable.  If you want to minimize the chance that someone is going to rob a liquor store to pay for baby formula then you need to ensure there is somewhere they can go to for help where the transaction doesn't have to involve a firearm.  The individual programmes that Bernie has outlined may not all fly even if he is elected and has an indifferent congress.

Conversely, make the candidate they may have voted for seem unpalatable enough and they may stay home on election day.   Except this is actually a way bigger liability for Hillary - haven't you noticed how apathetic the left seems about her? How, even though on paper she's a decent candidate, somehow she's become progressively more unpalatable in the public eye, even to liberals?"
politics,3dxipt,MemeticParadigm,3,Mon Jul 20 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"It's important to energize the base. Going back at least as far as Reagan, the more charismatic candidate has won, not necessarily because they had the best positions, but because the opposition's supporters stayed home.

politics,3dxipt,MayorPoopenmeyer,4,Mon Jul 20 18:03:26 2015 UTC,"Except the GOP fear-machine is already finely-tuned - that's why they have an advantage in off-years and when turnout is low in general - socialist or not, trying to goose Republican turnout even further using fear-based tactics, at this point, seems to me like trying to squeeze blood from a stone.  The Democrats, on the other hand, have a much bigger problem with apathy and, IMO, folks on the left are pretty damn apathetic about Hillary, whereas Bernie actually seems to be energizing the base everywhere that word about him starts to spread in earnest."

They were told over and over again that it was a horrible thing, while never being exposed to the concept in a real life situation.   The county didn't implode as soon as Obama took office. No one took our cow and gave us half the milk we were used to. The bad things never happened.  Most people favor the healthcare reform, act and they now associate it with socialism thanks to Fox.

For years, Gallup's been asking the following question: ""If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be X, would you vote for that person?""   In the most recent iteration of that (from June 2-7), respondents were least likely to say yes when ""X"" was ""socialist"" at 47%. More respondents said they'd vote for an atheist (58%) or a Muslim (60%).  Democrats were more accepting of a socialist candidate than Independents or Republicans (at 59%, which because we're in the primary is the relevant stat) and Sanders' appeal to younger voters could help, because they were the most likely to say they'd vote for a socialist (and were the least picky across the board), and I think we'll eventually get to a point where ""socialist"" isn't political poison.  Right now, though, I'm not sure it bodes well for the idea that ""Maybe being a socialist country isn't such a bad idea after all"" is in the minds of American voters if half of those polled said they wouldn't vote for a socialist under any circumstances."

The phrase ""just happened to be [black/Muslim/Jewish/a woman]"" implies that they'd have said identity, but would still mostly follow the tenets of whatever ""your party"" was - whereas ""just happened to be [a socialist]"" implies an ideological leaning that potentially overrides whatever you feel ""your party"" stands for.  Comparing the numbers for ""a socialist"" to all those other identity-based descriptors without also including numbers for ""a conservative"" and ""a liberal"" is just misleading."

They have a strong rep at home and a gerrymandered election.  The past two presidential cycles have lead to a majority of people demanding something different and they have not cared at all in the legislature. Meanwhile the past two legislative cycles have seen a growing conservative/tea party caucus. The President is one part. Let's not pretend it will all change at every level. It won't.  So what does Sanders trade? How does he accomplish these goals? Populist candidates are great but people need to hear plans. Pragmatics are more electable for this reason. They can clearly state what they trade cause they rarely go too far to one extreme, whether Conservative or Liberal. Sanders needs to make his case soon."
politics,3dxipt,XaoticOrder,38,Mon Jul 20 16:04:11 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind about agenda setting is that a conservative congress isn't going to appreciate Clinton's agenda just because it'll be moderate (not that it is clearly defined, but that is beside the point). Republican opposition to Obama's policy initiatives has been indiscriminate, they hit everything. My point being it'll be just as tough and less productive for a democratic President who asks less.  If Sanders can bring on his wave of populism some congressmen and a few senators, He can build a caucus, with support from the Democratic party. Then the question becomes not what he would have to trade to Republicans for his agenda, but what they have to trade to hold back parts of it.  The last bit I think is key is that Sanders' issues include campaign finance reform. That issue is the silver bullet to tackling all the other ones. If Sanders' can get nothing but real election reform through (getting money out of politics, a national solution for gerrymandering), then republicans may find 2018 unkind to them and subsequently their opposition to Sanders' policy initiatives."

Which brings us back to the issue of which candidate is most likely to agitate for and inspire a sufficiently “massive” electoral uprising, explicitly to purge the right from power (democratically, electorally, of course) and to suppress their jive ass (legislatively and judicially, of course), from now on...despite the best efforts of Republicans to suppress that turnout...  I think it's obvious that Bernie has the best chance of turning out that vast reservoir of Democratic leaning ""usual non-voters"" that make up some 50% of the eligible electorate.   I somewhat agree with you that Bernie should be talking about that more specifically, when calling for “pressure” from the grassroots…in terms of moar progressives, greens, socialists, whatever candidates stepping up to actually challenge Blue Dog ilk in the Democratic primaries, at all levels, to actually materially seize the power, for a change.  Marches and protests, letters, calls and petitions, demonstrations of concern, angst, anger, etc. are all very well and good...but their only really material value is if they succeed in persuading moar people to vote for more better representatives, seems to me.

If the goal is appointments aren't you more likely to bet on the sure thing? I know it's a ll a gamble but I'm only referring to the power of appointments.  It's very likely that all the Democratic nominees will pick SCOTUS appointments from the same small pool of candidates. And if Sanders can't deliver should we choose someone who will all be it more centrist?  Complicated by that is how will a far left candidate help fellow politicians in conservative states.

He will also be a pariah  before the opposition in Congress. So again what does he trade to get any of it done?  He has at least 4 years of guaranteed Republican opposition before a census and there is nothing the people can do to change that. Plus a good 45% of the country will oppose him at any given time. So how does he make it work from his position? not what we have to do from  ours.
politics,3dxipt,XaoticOrder,4,Mon Jul 20 17:03:49 2015 UTC,"His views on what he wants to do are not promising that he will be able to accomplish all of them.

Some like campaign finance reform are completely ignored, this is I believe one of the fundamental issues facing out country. Second, segregation of too much wealth in the too few a hand. These are devastating issues and I believe a President Sanders would do a lot for those 2 issues. Even if the Congress blocks him, I believe that he has the nuance to make some headway in bi partisan politics. Truth is however, whether or not he is successful in doing the things he said he wants to do. A presidential candidate that is genuine, not vague and genuinely cares for the people is so rare these days, I would easily vote for him over Corporate Clinton, or any of the Republicans. Just by being in that position, he will be able to inform people like never before in recent years. Also you said 45% of the country will oppose him. That statement does not make any sense without stating what issue we are talking about. There are many issues, where a large portion of the country will be on his side. For some issues, I am sure, people will disagree with him. But I doubt anyone could honestly say that he was not sincere in what he did. That alone, as I said before, is worthy of our votes in my opinion. Otherwise we are on a path (or already there?) where elections dont matter because what president we choose makes no difference. No new ways of doing things are initiated. No new ideas about governance. The same status quo. The same doublespeak."

I don't think passion is everything and he needs to explain some nuances of how he will govern.  I have worked with many of these people, for and with. I can tell you they aren't doing this for some ego trip or money. There are easier jobs to get those. They actually believe what they say, just like Sanders. I disagree with so many of them but in the end they are decent people (Boehner is a fun guy, Issa is a nerd, Hillary is very private but really helps out her staff, Bernie is cranky like a grandpa you adore, Cheney is a man's man kind of like a farmer, these are horrible descriptions) anyways, Everyone of them is pursuing their ideal of what is right. Sanders is doing the same.  The thing is because I ahve seen this stuff I don't get endeared with an idea of how a person will govern, I want to know. I need them to tell me, then they are accountable later. I'm not advocating for Hillary or O'Malley or Sanders. I am saying that they are all better options. Now they have to prove it. But for Sanders people are just following in behind him and he hasn't said anything besides populist themes. I need more.  The 45% is a political threshold. Generally on any issue a minimum of 45% will disagree for one reason or another. They are not the same people on the same issues. Very rarely you will see a super majority in agreement but it takes time to reach it. if you look back at political history you will see most issues (not all) are actioned on by government once they reach a 55% public approval. people are predictable.  All said I appreciate your passion. Elections do matter even if Sanders is not involved. who you elect makes a difference. Their donors don't have strings attached to them even though we often think they do. They are mostly sincere individuals who we love to hate."

If that's how utterly unchangeable you think the outcome is, why do you even follow the primary at all? Furthermore, if you think it's that set in stone, aren't you upset?

When we get horrible elected officials, it's almost always from an election where the turnout was low.   I don't expect we'll be getting single-payer or comprehensive immigration reform.

He made a lot of boneheaded decisions in the run up and pulled a lot support in the wrong states.    I think Bernie's is a message campaign: get to the debates to talk about issues that are near and dear to him, get Hillary on the record about those issues, pull her candidacy left (I mean, if she could get off script for a moment), run as long as he has money, graciously bow out."

The number of ""Bernie is going to win 100%"" posts is unreal. If anyone here knew how to read a poll or just compare two numbers, they would see this is the furthest thing from the truth. I would rather people not have unrealistic expectations about the future. I want people to vote for Hillary in the general election. I have seen an alarming number of posts on Reddit over the last few months that say something to the tune of ""I would never vote for Hillary over anyone because she's a corporate whore who deserves [etc etc etc...]."" This is absurd and counterproductive. If you're a Sanders supporter and your not voting for Hillary in the general you're essentially ""voting"" for a Republican. You can argue against this logic all you want, but no argument you make is going to suddenly make Al Gore president... Liberals who refused to ""fall in line"" or think pragmatically cost Democrats the White House for 8 years.     ** I say you should vote for the candidate you want to win ""right now"" because it's fine to support someone in the primary to push the party to the left. However, actually nominating Sanders is the fast way to lose the general. There's literally zero polling data that supports an argument that he can win and quite a lot of really damning polling info out there suggesting nearly any of the Republicans could beat him.

In the most recent national poll (Suffolk), only 20% of blacks and 10% of Hispanics polled found Sanders ""unfavorable."" More than 50% of both groups had either never heard of him or had heard of him but were undecided. Now, I'm not saying that that means they love him or that he has minority votes in the bag or some other hogwash, but to say ""on the aggregate, non-white Democrats hate Sanders"" is just pure confabulation.     This is absurd and counterproductive. If you're a Sanders supporter and your not voting for Hillary in the general you're essentially ""voting"" for a Republican.     I have never once advocated this approach. In fact, Bernie Sanders himself would almost certainly encourage support for Hillary Clinton if she wins the nomination.

Also, I'm not going through a 400 page document to find one line. If it's different than the next-to-most-recent polling (which I've provided), give me a page number at least...

In the senators own words: http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/14/hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders-meet-again-in-the-senate/    Trade Agreements: Mr. Sanders hates them; Mrs. Clinton is lukewarm, depending on the fine print.     The War in Iraq: He always opposed the war; she was for it before she was against it. The Patriot Act: He voted against it; she voted for it as a senator and has been mostly mum about N.S.A. bulk data collection since. Keystone XL Pipeline: Mr. Sanders strongly opposes the contentious North American oil pipeline loathed by environmentalists; Mrs. Clinton has not spoken out for or against the project, beyond voicing her general concerns about climate change. Wall Street: He wants to see the big banks broken up and the 1933 Glass-Steagall regulatory provision reinstated; she wants increased regulation on banks and the so-called shadow banking industry of hedge funds and high-frequency trading, but she has not advocated to reinstate Glass-Steagall or break up the big banks (and is unlikely to do so). Minimum Wage: He wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour; she has said that she, too, wants to raise the minimum wage, but has not specifically called for $15 an hour. Debt-Free College: He has proposed a plan that would make public colleges and universities tuition free by putting into affect a financial transaction tax; she has pushed to make college “as debt-—free as possible,” but has not specified how and has not endorsed the financial transaction tax.   In short, Bernie has a solid track record and always follows through with promises, while addressing tough politics instead of pussyfooting around wondering how it will affect popularity."
politics,3dxipt,coalitionofilling,41,Mon Jul 20 20:07:43 2015 UTC,"In short, Bernie has never actually had to consider the reality of passing meaningful legislation in a divided congress.  Don't get me wrong, Hillary is one of the most liberal memebers of the Democratic party, but the reason she isn't spouting off policies as liberal as Sanders is because there is going to be much greater scrutiny on her ability to actually put those policies into action.  She isn't going to advocate free college, because it is not politically feasible right now, she is not going to support a Financial Transactions Tax, because it would result in half the businesses on the NYSE moving to London, shes not going to support raising the min wage to $15 because it is too extreme and there could be serious unforeseen economic risks.  Wait and see her Wall Street reform plan. Despite reddit insisting she is in the pocket of the big banks, that isn't actually true, and she has always been a supporter of increased regulation. I'm not sure she will ever support the reintroduction of Glass-Steagal, simply because there is no consensus amongst economists that it would help, so any advice she is receiving is probably focused on other solutions"

Free market capitalism combined with a ""safety net""—  in practice it is damn near the best government a progressive could realistically hope for and with fewer fundamental problems than a truly capitalistic system.  Desperation is a defining characteristic in American culture.  Medical problem?  Desperate financial hardship followed by bankruptcy.  Economic contraction?  Job loss followed by less money for food.  Redistribution through programmes like food stamps, social security, Affordable Care Act, etc. help the most needy with a fundamental compact unconsciously entered into between the populace and the government to take the desperation out of the lives of those who are most vulnerable.  If you want to minimize the chance that someone is going to rob a liquor store to pay for baby formula then you need to ensure there is somewhere they can go to for help where the transaction doesn't have to involve a firearm.  The individual programmes that Bernie has outlined may not all fly even if he is elected and has an indifferent congress.  But just like Obama and ACA (I am still amazed it got through), it only takes one or two clear fundamental wins to create a lasting legacy that will change the american landscape for generations."

It says discouraging things about your candidate. But that doesn't make it less true, or less worth reporting. It would be more of a disservice, in terms of journalistic integrity, for the article's author to pretend that Sanders and Clinton are on anything resembling comparable footing.   I'm not buying it. Who in their right mind, after watching Hillary's vague and evasive answers as to what her agenda is all about, would want her to be the next president.    And yet Clinton has likability ratios twice as strong as Sanders, is ahead by 40+ points nationally, and has incredible support among minority voters. So, clearly, there are a lot of people - in their right minds - who want her to be their next President.  Is it possible that you've simply wildly misjudged the priorities and desires of the Democratic base?"

This way Trump can lead early on and say things nuttier than even most repubs would agree with just to make the rest of the candidates nuttiness appear sane.

He got rid of all the usual decorum and is saying the same shit they say at the neigborhood bar after a few beers.
politics,3dzoju,kanst,4,Tue Jul 21 12:50:48 2015 UTC,"The thing with most Republicans that want to be president is that they generally have to pander to these types while not explicitly agreeing with them- if they straight-up denounce them they won't get elected in a primary, but if they straight-up agree with them then they won't get elected in a national election. Fundamentally, every politician has to walk the line between appealing to the base and appealing to the rest of the electorate, but the gap between what those two groups believe has grown for Republicans in the past couple of decades.   Meanwhile, Trump doesn't give a fuck about the above. He's essentially the Republican party's id made manifest. This is terrible for the rest of the GOP field, since his shenanigans are essentially forcing their hands and requiring them to take a side on these things and piss off the base or the rest of the country rather than walking the line."

In fact, no reliable figure seems to be available  In part this is because Greece has a large ""shadow economy"" - earning money without paying income tax, or perhaps avoiding paying VAT.  That means that nearly one in four euros that potentially could be taxed in the country's economy simply weren't declared to the authorities  There is also evidence to suggest that the Greeks aren't very good at collecting taxes even outside the shadow economy.  When the OECD had tried to do similar surveys between 2005 and 2009 they found that the data was simply ""missing"".  Figures from the European Commission suggest Greeks do retire earlier on average than many others in the EU   The EU's figures also put Greece's spending on pensions, as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP), as the highest in Europe in 2012.  But with Greece's debt now at 175% of its GDP, what is clear is that the country has been living beyond its means.  It's not through complex schemes, it's simply through shops not giving receipts, and the government not keeping track of what people earn.   Etc. etc.. Excerpts, of course, but yeah, ""highly exaggerated rhetoric of German newspapers"". Always blame the Germans.   Meanwhile, credible German newspapers:   Mythos vom faulen Südeuropäer (Myth of the lazy Southern European)   spiegel.de in 2011   Griechen sind nicht faul (Greeks aren't lazy)   rp-online.de in 2011   Von wegen nicht mehr zu retten, faul und undankbar (So much for being beyond remedy, lazy and ungrateful)   zeit.de in 2012   Ein Kommentar dazu wäre, dass die Griechen nicht faul sind. (A comment on that would be that Greeks aren't lazy.)   deutschlandradiokultur.de in 2015  You might want to think about not comparing tabloid rhetoric to credible journalism rhetoric."

Was it incompetence when the former Greek government conspired with Goldman Sachs to cook their books and con their way into the Euro?  Was it incompetence for Greece's ruling classes to then take advantage of the hundreds of billions being thrown at them by private German and French banks who conducted no due diligence into the country's ability to pay the money back?  Was it incompetence when the French and German governments then nationalised the loans of their private banks in order to frame the debt as a moral dilemma where Greece owed the citizens of Europe the money instead?  There's plenty more to this story than plain old incompetence. Systemic corruption seems more apt to me.

Greece's tax evasion is an enormous fiscal problem, but fixing it isn't the most pressing issue right now - when you're in a sinking ship, you don't spend your time designing the hull of the replacement.  2) They've increased the average retirement age (you must work for at least 40 years), they've cut the maximum amount you can earn, and they're now based on average career earnings and not the last five years.  3) The biggest portion of those were effectively scams, and once recognized, the Greek government stopped paying those and has been trying to recoup the money. There are still some weird rules - the fact that never-wed daughters of soldiers or policemen can collect their father's pension is a particularly stupid one that comes to mind - but there has been serious effort to try to fix the clusterfuck that is the Greek pension system.  Again, Greece is in desperate need of long-term structural reform, and has been utterly screwed by corrupt governance since the end of WW2. That having been said, the current economic problems with Greece are entirely related to two things; they have an enormous amount of debt, and use the Euro, a currency they do not control."

This isn't even getting into the fact that Greek Shipping Magnates (some of the wealthiest, if not the wealthiest individuals in Greece) are literally given an exemption from all taxation.

So after they all celebrated their vote they went back to the bargaining table and ended up accepting a deal that was only marginally different from the one they had just refuse.

Due to the rules of this system, it is impossible for humanity to ever be debt free from these banks.  To pay off existing debts and have sufficient money for an economy to function, there has to be an ever-increasing amount of debt over time.  People and businesses won't take on debt, unless through production or employment, they foresee that they can pay their lenders back.  To create these productive activities, we need to exploit more land and resources.  The big problem is that we live on a finite planet.  We can't support infinite economic growth.

Remember, throughout this entire time, they did not enact austerity measures or crack-down on the rampant tax evasion to help their debts. Then in 2010, when they were about to default, Germany, the Euro and the World Banks, instead of kicking them out of the Euro for lying, gave them HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of Euros to help them with the thought that they would improve their ways and repay the debts. Guess what happened, they didn't. They didn't enact enough austerity and they didn't crack down on the rampant tax evasion. Whereas countries like Ireland and Spain who also had difficulty (not from lying, but from the GFC 2009) and got bailouts, they improved their system and were repaying their debts. Recently, the Greeks elected a government (one where the Golden Dawn, who are fascists, possess 10% of the parliament) who is totally deficient and does not want to pay back their debts, but instead want to have it all be written off and be allowed to stay in the Euro. Stop painting them as the oppressed people's who have no chance or no hope. Do you know how many countries would love to have the opportunities that Greece had. Here's a picture for you, Syrians are fleeing to the oppressed country of Greece.

The Fruits of free trade have been shared poorly in the US. The american left unfortunately blames free trade, rather than the policy makers who ensured it wouldn't greatly benefit the average person. Canada gas seen its largest post war expansion in median family income following NAFTA.  Removing such a trade deal would greatly harm a country that could really just be like any american state.   Also wrt keystone: the oil is moving via rail, which is much more environmentally unfriendly and dangerous than by pipeline.

And while he might be gaining new conservative fans, he's absolutely alienating himself from a large number of moderate to liberal consumers.   Now let's put aside the idea that this is a cash grab. Is it a vanity run? Absolutely. But not the type of vanity run that everyone is assuming it is.   I've been mulling this over in my head for the past week or so and I think that it's a very real possibility that Trump actually desires to be President. Think about this for a moment:   Trump is an absolute egomaniac. At a certain point, Trump might very well have realized that his ""legacy"" isn't all that spectacular. I mean, sure he's a billionaire and sure he's lived a great life. But in actuality, he isn't a billionaire like Rockefeller or Carnegie or Vanderbilt. He wasn't revolutionary in his field of expertise. He's no Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Daniel Day Lewis. He'll likely be forgotten within a couple of decades after his passing, save for some Trivial Pursuit questions or localized history of NYC. And he's become aware of this.  But what if he became President? That would surely secure a place in the history books for an extended period of time. And guess what? In his mind, this is a completely achievable goal. In his mind, he's the greatest mind of all time. In his mind, he is what this country needs. In his mind, he can do it his way. The Trump way. The way he's become the most successful, luxurious, genius in American Business history.   This is the Trump mentality that I think we're seeing and I think everybody in the political world should be viewing his campaign through this lens."

Trump was angry that McCain didn't win against Obama years ago and blames him for what has happened to America today.  However, attacking McCain's POW status is just very dickish.    McCain is a very good politician and his POW training comes in great when dealing with Rand Paul's filibusters.  I think McCain probably would have made a very good president but he didn't have that flashy movie star charisma Obama had.  I'll never forget McCain's ""Mayonnaise Gate,"" when a jar of mayo fell on the ground during a PR visit to a store and he made it very clear that he was not a commoner and he certainly was not going to help clean it up.

politics,3dxipq,RedBullWings17,3,Mon Jul 20 21:33:21 2015 UTC,"From his Wikipedia entry: As a naval aviator, McCain flew attack aircraft from carriers. During the Vietnam War, he narrowly escaped death in the 1967 Forrestal fire. On his twenty-third bombing mission in October 1967, he was shot down over Hanoi and badly injured. He subsequently endured five and a half years as a prisoner of war, including periods of torture. In 1968, he refused a North Vietnamese offer of early release, because it would have meant leaving before other prisoners who had been held longer.   McCain was almost killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. While the air wing was preparing to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. McCain later said, ""I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere."" McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out the cockpit, working himself to the nose of the jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator.  McCain joined Oriskany on September 30, 1967, for a tour he expected would finish early the next summer. He volunteered to fly the squadron's most dangerous missions right away, rather than work his way up to them. During October 1967, the pilots operated in constant twelve-hour on, twelve-hour off shifts. McCain would be awarded a Navy Commendation Medal for leading his air section through heavy enemy fire during an October 18 raid on the Lac Trai shipyard in Haiphong. On October 25, McCain successfully attacked the Phúc Yên Air Base north of Hanoi through a barrage of anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missile fire, which would garner him the Bronze Star. Air defenses around Hanoi were then the strongest they would be during the entire war."

I think the law will be good in the long-term....certainly the logic makes sense that if one is mentally/cognitively unable to safely manage one's finances, then other areas of that person's life also warrant extra precaution.  What I worry about is the short-term impact on disabled individuals and their families who may not understand the nuances of what this means.   Here in the South, every weekend there is a Confederate Flag parade in my town, people are not happy about same-sex marriage being legal, people are fearful of the race riots of Baltimore and Ferguson, we're negotiating with Iran, and Tennessee just had its first terror attack by someone who's increasingly looking like a radical Islamist. Throw the fear of being unable to protect oneself by having a gun and many of these individuals who never would've considered owning a gun may rush out to buy one, simply out of the fear that if they don't buy one now then they will never be able to.   I don't know about the rest of the US, just my own little corner. And I proudly voted for Obama....twice. My concern is just for the short-term. A lot of people who deal poorly with change are having to accept a lot of changes in a short amount of time...this gun policy may just push some of them over the edge."

I happen to be very familiar with what this means because as the article states they plan to use the same model the VA already uses. I have worked with several vets to help get their right to bear arms back.  For the VA it literally came down to a doctor checking a little box during an exam that states the veteran was incapable of managing his own affairs. Sometimes this was because the doctor marked it by accident. Sometimes it was because the spouse said they paid the bills (mentioning nothing about the vets mental capacity) and the doctor took this to mean the vet couldn't handle their bills. Sometimes this was because the vet had limited physical movement so they had someone else take care of their finances for them, again nothing at all to do with their mental ability.  The VA sees that box checked and opens an investigation into whether or not the vet should should be declared incompetent. Sometimes it gets resolved the way it should, sometimes the VA shoves their fingers in their ears and screams ""I'm not listening!""  Feel free to Google ""VA fiduciary"" to see exactly what I'm talking about.  You have literally contributed nothing to this argument. Literally nothing.

politics,3e035m,ercax,2,Tue Jul 21 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"There are about 80 million gun owners in the US, there are about 12,000 murders per year by a firearm.

And yes, you're absolutely correct that a right guaranteed to us by the constitution isn't 100% safe from any regulations or anything, and I'm fine with that.

Fair point. I'm fine with a careful approach to determining who exactly is so mentally deficient as to be untrustworthy with a weapon, and that's coming from someone who's generally pretty fine with limiting gun purchasing/ownership in principle.   Everyone would be aghast at such logic if it was about the right to vote or the right against unreasonable searches, but since it's gun rights some people are like eh, what's the big deal?   Well, it's a difference of opinion on how important gun rights are. And reasonable people can differ about that. Especially since gun ownership if you live in a high-rise with 24/7 security in Manhattan, for example, means something very different from gun ownership in Camden, or rural Wyoming.  But even speaking as someone who puts some effort into trying to better understand the pro-gun side, I think people being more aghast at restricting the right to vote or the right against unreasonable searches makes very good sense. Voting is literally the key mechanism by which our society works. It's just about impossible to overstate its importance as a civil right. And protection against unreasonable searches is the single biggest barrier into government intrusion into our private lives. Police will absolutely make unreasonable searches if they can get away with it, so you pretty much need this requirement if you don't ultimately want a society dominated by the police, or a real, literal police state.  ...does individual gun ownership really have that level of importance?  There's a phrase in constitutional interpretation that gets brought up when the Supreme Court decides whether a certain right is constitutionally required to be protected by the states. They ask whether that right is, to use one phrasing, ""fundamental to a scheme of ordered liberty."" It's a relatively short list, and voting and freedom from unreasonable searches absolutely belong on it. Without voting, you don't have a democracy, and without freedom from unreasonable searches, you don't have a free society. But the existence of countries that are highly restrictive of gun ownership yet clearly remain free and functional societies (Germany, for instance) proves that it is perfectly possible to have ""ordered liberty"" without gun rights. In this sense, it is simply not on the same level as voting and freedom from unreasonable searches. (And in case someone brings it up, saying that Germany by definition isn't truly free because of their restrictive position on gun ownership would be begging the question.)  Is there something about the American context specifically that changes this? Is gun ownership just much more important in America, so as to rank with the key civil rights of society? Maybe. We've got massive borders that are currently impossible to secure, meaning gun ownership can't be limited to law-abiding people, militias, or police. We've got widespread gun ownership already, legal and illegal, allowing the pro-gun side to argue for still wider gun ownership so that law-abiding people can defend against the risks this entails. We've got huge rural areas in which, as I said, gun ownership is a lot more important than it is in more comfortable (for lack of a better word) settings. And this has already turned into a very long post, so I'll try to avoid opening the can of worms that is the history and interpretation of the Second Amendment by just nodding to its existence, and that of the widespread belief in certain circles that gun ownership by the citizenry as a whole is a crucial check on government oppression.  But even with all that, even in the unique context of America, I don't think that individual gun ownership is so important as to rank with voting and freedom from unreasonable searches, two of the most indispensable liberties a free society needs. And that's why people would be aghast if this logic was being applied to those rights instead. End rant."

It doesn't even say someone handles ALL of their finances, simply that another person is assigned to handle their pension or disability payments.  Someone can be declared incompetent to handle their finances yet not be declared incompetent enough to take care of themselves. There are several types of guardianships when it comes to this sort of thing. A financial guardian simply takes care of the finances and nothing else.

My dad's best friend was legally blind and completed medical school with some help and became an excellent psychiatrist, which is great, but no...he probably shouldn't be allowed to do Neuro surgery.  Am I willing to have someone determine this from a thought out fair system with professional input, yes... Am I willing to make blanket requirements, no."

politics,3e035m,GameofCheese,0,Tue Jul 21 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"It is controversial because we have the ADA in the US, we don't allow descrimination on the basis of disability, and there is a constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. If a blind person can pass the same safety training as a sighted person, they get to carry a gun. Several notable blind individuals have permits to carry concealed firearms for self defense, and more are able to use them safely for sport and hunting.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carey_McWilliams_(marksman)  Your assumption that a blind person can't safely own or use a firearm is discrimination, plain and simple, and it is incorrect."
politics,3e035m,demagogue451,0,Tue Jul 21 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't assume anything, I just wasn't being thorough on my thoughts. Obviously if you can pass all the legal requirements I don't have an issue with it. If you can't, I do. (Although I don't know enough to say that I'm concrete on that).  And by the way, there are a couple of completely blind people that can ""see"" through echo location which provides mapping of distinct objects and people in the brain of these ""gifted"" individuals. They would therefore have other abilities that compensate for their disability, making their disability a non issue.   Don't make assumptions on my assumptions. I work in health care and care very deeply for the rights and  accommodations of the disabled.  I'm sorry if I didn't give enough disclaimers.   I don't think all blind people have the ability to safely pass gun classes, and they shouldn't be godfathered out of that requirement simply because they are disabled. That was my point.  P.s. Thank you for that link. I have heard of this guy before. I still feel extremely uncomfortable in the extreme with someone who can't identify a person in front of them at all by sight being able to carry. That being said, obviously this guy sounds extremely caring about proper safety.   To be honest, the legally blind guy I was talking about in my other comment was legal to drive in California but not North Dakota so he just drove with an out of state license. I didn't feel safe driving with him. I don't know if he was safe to drive. It's a grey area.   These are interesting arguments."
politics,3e035m,GameofCheese,6,Tue Jul 21 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't assume anything, I just wasn't being thorough on my thoughts.    You said this, and I quote exactly:  ""I just said I think completely blind people shouldn't get to use guns. I don't think that should be so controversial.""  I understand you simply hadn't thought it all the way through, but you didn't carve out any exception for blind people who are able to own and use a gun safely.   I don't think all blind people have the ability to safely pass gun classes, and they shouldn't be godfathered out of that requirement simply because they are disabled   Fair enough.  However it is important to note that there is no gun safety testing requirement to own or carry guns in many states.  Where there are no such requirements for ordinary civilians, blind people shouldn't have any additional requirement beyond what is required for other law abiding civilians.  It goes both ways.  They don't get any special exemption to requirements where they exist, and they don't have to endure any additional testing that ordinary civilians wouldn't have to pass."
politics,3e035m,demagogue451,4,Tue Jul 21 01:17:45 2015 UTC,"Omg. I agree!  But that's insane there is no requirement in some states. I understand the different needs in different areas, hence different laws... But wow, no need for basic gun safety seems crazy to me.  Ok. My new official position on gun control laws is that at the very least every state should require a gun safety certification. I'm just going to focus on that first."
politics,3e035m,TeslaIsAdorable,7,Tue Jul 21 01:23:10 2015 UTC,"Why do you feel there is a need for a gun safety certification? In the states that passed such a requirement they were never able to show that it has any statistical impact on gun accidents or gun deaths. Gun accidents are very rare in the US, and are down significantly in recent years, to 505 in 2013. That makes up 1.5% of gun deaths and .4% of accidental injury deaths for that year.  In rural states with small populations they may go years without any fatal gun accidents in the whole state, so they see no need for a requirement. The requirement costs money and presents a time and money burden in the right to keep and bear arms. It disenfranchises the poor and minorities from their rights, and in rural areas you may have to drive 4 hours or more to get to a gun safety course. People who work two full time jobs don't have time and money for that, and why should they need to, since it doesn't provably save any lives?"

There are many varying degrees of blindness, some people can actually see (somewhat) fine even though they are legally blind.  But okay, now you are clarifying and saying completely blind people. But again on what basis should blind people lose one of their rights? Why should blind people, who are already at a disadvantage when it comes to protecting themselves, have even fewer rights to protect themselves?  Are we assuming a blind person is going to just start shooting everything at random because they can't see? They are blind, not stupid or crazy."
politics,3e035m,bardwick,4,Tue Jul 21 00:20:13 2015 UTC,"No.... BUT THEY CAN'T SEE. They can't see what they are shooting at. I'm sorry, but in my opinion it seems like asinine to let people use a deadly weapon that requires sight to use safely.  Extremely mentally disabled people can't consent to sex or marriage. Are you ""taking away"" their rights? (It absolutely depends on the ability of the person, but let's assume persistent minimally conscious vegetative state for this argument) then no, you aren't taking away anything they don't have the ability to use. Would you give a gun to a 2 yr old? What about an adult with the proven mental capacity of a two year old? Should we give them guns just so they aren't being discriminated against?  I understand your position, I do. You are obviously very concerned about what you think the 2nd amendment means for ALL Americans. And honestly, I would rather err on the side of less regulation than more regulation.  But there has to be some limits between where someone's right to bear arms ends and where someone else's right to be free from harm begins.   Is it complicated, confusing, and hard to determine? Absolutely! But it's something worth talking about. And I think it would be a mistake to blanket allow everyone to carry any weapon of their choosing simply because the constitution was written before technological advances allowed them to predict applicable situations.  P.s. My first comment was sarcastic, and I'm sorry if I came off being more ""extreme"" in my views than were accurate."

politics,3dzxev,lol4liphe,0,Tue Jul 21 01:51:35 2015 UTC,Trump made a stupid remark but it was without a doubt a personal attack at Mccain and not a mass hatred for PoWs. He was attacking back at mccain for calling his supporters crazy. Obviously it was a dumb statement but he also obviously doesn't think PoWs in general are garbage.  Being a hero isn't a free pass to be an asshole to people.

While Donald Trump was screwing a bunch of models in clubs - and, I might add, acting basically like a slum lord for his dad - McCain was being tortured in a prison camp. When they offered to let him go as a publicity stunt, he refused out of respect of the other soldiers. The reason Trump's numbers are (probably) taking a nosedive isn't so much of McCain but because news stories have increasingly scrutinized Trump's business career and made it clear that he's a giant prick."

The point here is, literally what he said is obviously not ok but he also without a doubt in my mind doesn't disrespect someone based on being a PoW. Even if that's the exact insult he chose to use.

And the conventional wisdom is that should Trump run as an independent it would destroy the Republican's chance of winning in 2016. And now we have our first data set to back up that theory:  In a two-way match-up between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, Clinton bests Bush by 10 points (51-41). (Obama won by a margin of about 4% in 2012)  In a three-way contest between Bush, Clinton and Trump, Clinton dominates Bush by 18 points at 47-29 with Trump at a huge 19% of the vote, siphoning off enough votes to potentially not only flip states like Georgia, Arizona and Missouri but potentially conservative bastions like Mississippi and Texas. Even without Texas and Mississippi, it would be the most decisive victory for a Democrat since the last time a Clinton faced a Bush in the general election."

That said, if he keeps his numbers up, he's our best hope for someone at least marginally qualified.  Consider this scenario -- Trump continues spewing ridiculous, media headlining, polarizing garbage. He continues alienating himself from the current Republican Party electorate and power wizards. So much so, that the other candidates really starts pushing him to drop more than they are now.  Eventually, they could push him/piss him off to the point that he makes the bid as an independent. As crazy as his shit is, he's speaking to the real vile core of the republican base. His numbers are depressingly impressive right now. If he goes independent, he splits the vote and puts a democrat in the White House practically by default.   I would bet that this is why it took an insult to the ""patriot"" vein to get any Republican Party response.  Immigrants be damned  in the eyes of the republican front runners, they already know they won't get the lions share of that vote. But, they'll take the risk for the veteran vote.

Which is exactly what the Senate would be doing by bringing it to the floor. They can add amendments or recommendations. After all, the State department didn't plan on requiring consent from Congress. Secretary Kerry wrote, ""We've been clear from the beginning. We're not negotiating a 'legally binding plan.' We're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement,"" An executive agreement, which is what the administration expected this deal to be, does not require the consent of the senate. A lot of people see this as a violation of the separation/checks/balances on federal power, which is why a vote is taking place.   Jamil Jaffer, former chief counsel on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told Bloomberg, ""For months on end, the administration conducted these negotiations in secret and then sought to make the deal on the president's authority alone, without ever exposing it to public debate or a vote by Congress,"" He also said, ""Now that Congress has taken that option off the table, it would be troubling, but not surprising, if the administration continued its longstanding effort to keep key elements of this deal away from public scrutiny."""

Both Democrats and Republicans have made pleas to the administration to work more professionally with Congress to negotiate a treaty that Congress could work with.  Obama has been steadfast on his insistence that he would give Congress only the most minimal access to work in progress and that Congresspeople should not give any feedback until he's released to them the final version, and then he only wants to hear the Yes/No decision.  This is a very irresponsible way to conduct business and leaves the whole process open to failure when Congresspeople find out what's in the Treaty and have to make the last minute snap decision about whether accepting the treaty is the right thing to do for their constituents.

Marijuana legalisation does change things in quite a lot of ways, but 'the people' can see how it benefits them (less spending on policing, tax boost, general apathy on the whole War on Drugs thing), but the interests that were really against it weren't being tackled.  With changes to climate change it is going to hurt people, and probably hit people pretty bad if we delay it any further, as we have to make quite massive, sweeping changes to our approach to infrastructure, consumerism, food, and lifestyle. A lot of people don't mind if a bill means that the richest in our country pay more, but when you say that you need to limit fuel consumption, switch to an energy source that will either be more expensive (in the short term definitely, in the long term probably not) or heavily subsidised by tax payer money. It takes something else to make people willingly pay more taxes to something, and especially in the US where, whether justified or not, taxes aren't seen as paying anything useful.  In the UK people repeatedly say they will pay more taxes to have an NHS that works better (with the crux being that it actually work for us), but that is an outlier to the standard trend of people not wanting to pay more taxes. This is compiled by using 'sin tax' like systems to minimise use of items that are harmful to the environment which would probably be regressive in nature, and therefore hurt the poorest most."

Still, as we awaken to the stakes here, I'm sure we'll do the right thing, and the author is right to say that change will come in a wave.

They've actually been the world leaders in renewable energy investment for a few years now.  It may be true that right now there are a lot of industrial-focused nations doing a lot of polluting, but they ARE starting to come onboard.    And, seriously, this is an area where the US should be a world leader, not sitting back and going ""But- but- look at all the guys who are years behind us in technology!  THEY'RE polluting, so why can't we!?""  After all, large countries like the US and China investing in this tech is what's going to allow it to become affordable for second- and third-tier nations.

The ones on the forefront go through the messy stages, because it's the only one known at the time. But if they find a cleaner, more efficient method, the countries that follow have the benefit of skipping the ugly stuff.   Example: home telephones. There was a time not too long ago when every home in the US had a wired land line. With cell phones, those are rapidly becoming completely obsolete. But we still have millions, if not billions, of miles of wire stretched across the landscape, and millions of poles supporting it all. It's an ugly, costly, horribly inefficient infrastructure. But now you see many developing countries in Africa and South America that have the luxury of skipping the landline infrastructure altogether. Saves a ton of money.   We're also seeing the same thing in indoor plumbing and waste management. Our system of the flushing toilet is outrageously inefficient and only exists because it's so heavily government subsidized. And again, look at the insane infrastructure it requires. That's why you see ""reinvent the toilet"" efforts. Kenyan countryside villages are skipping the plumbing all together for a much more affordable and efficient self contained system.   TL;DR - Our development of cleaner energy means developing countries can skip the dirty."

They required interpreting a minority event with a different value.  Dignity and compassion for same sex marriage wearing down tradition based arguments.  Privacy, liberty, and fairness (the incarceration arguments) for legalization of marijuana wore down erroneous assumptions about gateway drugs and brain damage.  In short, many people who were not themselves effected by these two issues were able to change their minds by changing the core values they used to evaluate the issue.  Many can, and do, support SSM without wanting to be SSM or even without knowing someone who does.  That won't be true about climate change.  It will require behavioral change, not just attitudinal change.  There is much more built in resistance here.

Now-a-days we burn 100x that for each person. On top of that our population has increased from 1 billion to 7 billion.   Cutting back on a few activities is a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the immense amount of energy we use. Realize that most of the energy you use is not directly from your interaction. You plug your computer in the wall, but you don't realize that 10 miles away is a coal fired power plant powering it. You pick up your Fedex package, but you don't realize that a series of freights, trains, and trucks got that there. You do like free shipping from Amazon, right? Going green would mean giving that up for choosing a more expensive alternative. Every product you see on a store shelf wasn't hand delivered down the street, they too got there by a series of freights, trains, and trucks. Most of the products themselves were probably made using the energy from fossil fuels.  The only way to go back from this would be to go Amish. Understandably, no one wants to.

Even if you could it still wouldn't ""fix"" climate change.  In college my class was given a paper to write on what we believed was the best fix for global warming. Everyone in my class wrote about something, whether it was recycling, clean energy, etc. I chose a different answer than everyone else: there currently is no fix for this issue. According to the national science foundation if you managed to prevent all man-made pollution right now, the earth's temperature would still increase by 1 degree every hundred years. And there's no way we'll be able to cut our pollution to 0.  True, it's possible to reduce our impact on the environment but I'm so tired of hearing people talk about a ""solution."" It's as though we have cancer and everyone is telling us that a cough drop is the cure.   The truth is that without some significant technological advance which can counter the warming of the earth we will never have a ""solution.""

These ""we just need to try hard and we'll fix everything"" stories just trivialize how huge and catastrophic this problem is and how much damage we've already done by ignoring the problem for so many decades.  Best case scenario, even if all developed nations on the planet shrink their emissions to practically zero over the next decade or two and developing countries shrink the zero over the decade or two after that and we start sucking CO2 out of the air on a massive global scale, we're still looking at a 3-4°C temperature rise. That means:   The highest temperature in 30 million years Sea level rise of 3-6 feet Persistent drought over 40% of currently inhabited land Hundreds of millions of climate refugees Half of all known species extinct   More realistically, some countries (think corrupt Africa countries, belligerent Russia, and oil-dependent Middle East) won't be on board. And we'll probably have many unforeseen problems with CO2 capture and storage technology. And if the past decades are any guide, the upcoming climate agreement isn't likely to come anywhere near reducing emissions to zero in the near future. So in all likelihood, even with a lot of people trying very hard with their hearts in the right place, we're headed for a 5-6°C temperature rise by 2100. And that means that positive CO2-increasing feedback effects will overtake any possibility of stabilizing our climate by sucking CO2 out of the air. That eventually means a 12°C increase by 2300, no matter what we do after 2100. And 12°C means that half of earth will be too hot for humans to survive outside (in other words, standing outside in the shade for more than an hour or so would kill you).

HOWEVER, might I direct your attention and resources to something to fix that is quite dramatic and life changing that IS on a global scale, and will prove both our capabilities to solve real problems AND free up funds to fix climate change?  Let's find a way to end the war on drugs.  If we can do that, then, /u/SandersWarren2016, I believe we can win the war on climate change.   Ending the war on drugs means we quit ending the economic lives of countless US and global citizens.  We stop funding military style police. We create wealth, through the absence of violence, in the poorest parts of this country. We create new economic possibilities.

politics,3dwwoc,dee_berg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:30 2015 UTC,"The title of this thread is misleading: The movements to legalize gay marriage and pot weren't ""led by the people"".  Gay marriage, as just one example, was so unpopular that the most liberal state in the union [California] took it to a vote--and it lost.  (That's why activists eventually decided to bypass the democratic process and take it to the judges. They removed it from the electorate because they felt that the electorate wasn't with them.)  It's the same reason why they changed the term ""gay marriage"" to ""marriage equality"". Turns out: Every time they used the term ""gay"" in polls the numbers tanked. They then scrambled for a term that would be more likeable to the wider society, and hit upon ""equality"". (""Who, after all, is against equality?"" It's one of our culture's Noble Lies.) So ""gay marriage"" was out and ""marriage equality"" was in.  Which begs the question: If homosexuality was so popular, why can't they use the term ""gay"" in polling?  (Would anybody else believe this of any other product or idea? ""We're so popular, we can't even use our name in the open!"" Like how GMO's have to hide and fight to ban labeling. If it was so inherently popular, why does it need to hide?)  In other words, if homosexual normalization campaigns were so popular, why would they need to edit the term ""gay"" out of polls to get better numbers? (The sad truth is: Gay marriage was never as popular as the TV would lead you to believe.)  Because the reality is: Homosexuals are an extremely tiny percentage of society. By statistical definition, they are outside the mainstream.  Same thing with pot smokers.  Neither of these groups had overwhelming ""popular support"".  So their victories were not ""victories of the democratic process,"" i.e., not ""triumphs of The People"" as the title of this thread suggests.  They were triumphs of small groups of active individuals. But then that's how change always happens. When the American revolution took place, only 1/3rd of the people were on the side of the revolutionaries.  H.G. Wells in his famous ""Outline of History"" talked about the Russian revolution, and what a fringe group the Bolsheviks were. (They never had wide support from the people they were claiming to represent.) Nevertheless, they ""took over all of Russia by taking over a single street in Moscow"". Because, as he adds, ""All of history is made by small groups of aggressive minorities.""  It's never made by the mob.  Events are always shaped by small elites, who can organize in a way that the masses cannot. They have focus, in a way that the crowds never can.  So if ""climate change legislation"" and the accompanying ""global tax"" come in, it won't be because of popular support. It'll be ushered in by a small elite--who will likely economically benefit from the global tax (as wealth is transferred from the masses to themselves).  This is not a ""victory of the people,"" but a triumph of the oligarchy. (Wealth transfers from working people to the rich always are.) The rich want to monetize the air. Just like in Spain now, where tax revenuers are trying to make more cash by monetizing the sun. (The more sun you get the higher you can be taxed.) Which takes us back to autocratic nations like Czarist Russia where Peter the Great taxed people for wearing beards. (Tax schemes like this are always scams.) It's interesting, watching the debate now on a global tax to combat climate change: ""They just want to take more of our money to selflessly help the planet! The people collecting the money? Trust them! Keep your mouth shut, and just hand it over. They're men of impeccable, unquestionable character. They just want to monetize the air. And every time you breathe out (and produce carbon dioxide), they want to be able to charge you. Totally legit."""

politics,3dwwoc,vlasvilneous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:51 2015 UTC,"Lately, I've become infatuated with a Carbon Tax. It's a far better solution than cap and trade and it's worked where implemented.  A carbon tax is a fee assessed on the carbon content of fuels. Because of the strict proportionality between fuels’ carbon content and their carbon dioxide emissions when burned, a carbon tax is effectively a tax on the carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. Thus, carbon tax is shorthand for carbon dioxide tax or CO2 tax — or, one could say, for a carbon pollution tax.  According to many analysts, a tax would be a more eco- nomically efficient policy for reducing CO 2  emissions  than an inflexible cap (with “inflexible” meaning a cap  whose level was not affected by the price of emission  allowances). That conclusion stems from the cumulative,  long-term nature of climate change: The benefit of emit- ting one less ton of CO 2 in a given year is roughly constant, whereas the cost of emitting one less ton of CO2 each year rises with each ton reduced. The reason for rising marginal costs is that companies that have to comply with an emission-reduction policy will make the cheapest  cuts first and progressively more expensive cuts thereafter.   Conservative economist Gregory Mankiw  Fortunately, a policy broader in scope is possible, which brings us to the third approach to dealing with climate externalities: putting a price on carbon emissions. If the government charged a fee for each emission of carbon, that fee would be built into the prices of products and lifestyles. When making everyday decisions, people would naturally look at the prices they face and, in effect, take into account the global impact of their choices. In economics jargon, a price on carbon would induce people to “internalize the externality.”  Krugman  But not nearly brave enough. Emissions taxes are the Economics 101 solution to pollution problems; every economist I know would start cheering wildly if Congress voted in a clean, across-the-board carbon tax. But that isn’t going to happen in the foreseeable future. A carbon tax may be the best thing we could do, but we won’t actually do it.  Australia cut carbon dioxide emissions from its electricity sector by as much as 17 million tonnes because of the carbon price and would have curbed more had industry expected the price to be permanent, according to an Australian National University study."

His job is easier if he doesn't have to distinguish between robbers and citizens who happens to be armed. If he notices an armed citizen, he may scrutinize the potential threat to the point where he misses an actual threat.   Also I think it is totally reasonable for any place that serves alcohol to ban guns on their premises. Drunk people and firearms do not mix.   Finally, any crowded place, especially a dark place like a theater is not likely to have less of a disaster because multiple people have guns. If one person brings a gun and begins shooting you have a massacre. If multiple people bring guns and begin shooting you have a firefight... in the dark... in a crowd. It really isn't that much better of a situation. If two people are shooting at each other and a third draws his weapon, how does he know who to shoot in the dark chaotic crowd?  I personally believe it is any property owners right to ban guns on his property. I'm not saying I support jail time or anything for violating such a ban, but property owners should be within their rights to eject you and ban you from returning for violating their rules. My favorite bar did exactly that about two weeks ago. There was a fistfight and one of the drunk beligerants afterwards was like, ""Look at how restrained I was, he hit me and I didn't even shoot him with my gun, I coulda done it, but I didn't. See I had my gun right here."" He then drew this weapon and swept the crowd showing it off. The bouncer disarmed him promptly, told him his weapon would be with the police, and bodily ejected him, telling him to never return."
politics,3dy7en,BrewmasterSG,2,Mon Jul 20 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"Finally, any crowded place, especially a dark place like a theater is not likely to have less of a disaster because multiple people have guns. If one person brings a gun and begins shooting you have a massacre. If multiple people bring guns and begin shooting you have a firefight... in the dark... in a crowd.   Kinda amazing people advocating concealed carry don't realize this. They kinda assume they will have perfect knowledge and awareness and would be the only law abiding gun carrier."

Even if you have the best reaction time and aim, the killer is going to shoot some people before he's stopped and any bystander getting shot is unacceptable.  And by saying that everyone is better off defending themselves and everyone should carry guns, you make people paranoid, checking out all the other people who are openly carrying there weapons.  So either your going to get an incident where someone accidentally shoots an innocent person over a misunderstanding or they don't notice the threat until too late because everyone is carrying guns."

There are signs in my grocery store parking lot that say ""Handicapped Parking Only."" I routinely see lowlife thugs with no handicap tag or ailment park there. The only people who obey the sign are people who live their lives playing by the rules. The sign does not exist to deter the lowlifes.

Is the additional sentencing on top of the potential life sentences for their multiple murders supposed to make them think twice?

They would need to pull out their weapon, turn around, find the shooter among a disorienting array of screaming patrons running in all directions, aim, and fire.  The shooter, on the other hand, will instantly see you turn to face him (since everyone else is doing the exact opposite), rotate a few degrees to aim, and fire.

This is why you practice at a range ad nauseum before you start doing every day carry.  You make it sound like this is a process that takes a while, and it doesn't. We don't have muskets anymore, I don't need to load powder and clean the bore before taking aim.

Almost every convenience store in my city has a shotgun behind the counter. You can see it if you get the right angle. I live in an urban city, btw, not backwoods Kentucky. They do this because they value the life of the employee if some fucking looter comes in. Remember how the Ferguson store owner was beaten up by looters?

Even with their years of training and experience.  Not to cap it off, is if you have 2+ ""good guys with guns"" and they both draw, how do they each know that the other guy drawing his gun, isn't also there to kill people? And they then start shooting at each other... And you just multiply the carnage by a factor of however many armed gunmen are in the theatre.  Not to mention, there's been several cases where the ""good guy"" shot or nearly shot the wrong people. An example would be Tucson 2011 when Gabby Giffords was shot. There was an unarmed man who tackled the shooter while he fumbled with his gun attempting to reload. And when the ""good guy"" with a gun came running to the rescue aimed his gun at the hero who'd just knocked the gunman down and nearly killed him.  Here's what I'd like you to do... Show me a 1st world nation, which has less lax gun laws than the US, but a lower murder rate.

There are probably many different reasons, but part of it is sort of the flip side of what you are saying. If citizens didn't carry guns, they are less likely to be falsely targeted as a criminal (lawsuit). Guns scare people. It's an establishment that sees all ages come through, they want those people to feel comfortable (even if it false).  There are situations that gun will help right, but on the flipside they can also make the situation worse. There is escalation involved once a second party brings in a gun. Realistically are the criminals that just start shoot equal to the the criminals that try to avoid it? I don't believe it is and why they play it this way.

A lot of members also join because they feel they have no other organization to represent them.   The big issue are the people who join to be active in it. These are the nutjobs who think the UN is going to come in and take our guns etc. So this minority (maybe 10% of NRA members) goes and makes the most noise and decisions.

Amusing, anecdotal, reductive, and in my opinion at least, irrelevant.

I felt quite threatened, as did many others.   I've walked into gas stations with cops nearby.   As have I.  A police officer has (theoretically) undergone and been tested on their weapons handling ability, their marksmanship, their judgement, and are entrusted with the authority to carry deadly force for use when absolutely unavoidable.   Having a gun doesn't compel you to shoot anyone, and in my experience if you think ""having a gun means you're gonna do violence to everybody"" you're paranoid.   No, but it certainly removes a lot of the work otherwise required to take a human life when the urge to do so overtakes one.  It doesn't mean that you will shoot me, but it definitely means that if you get confused, you're intoxicated, you're emotionally distraught or otherwise incapacitated, your mistake will be a fatal one for me.  I don't think this is paranoid. Overcautious I would argue. I think it's quite realistic. Humans are unpredictable.   In my experience I know several gun owners, none of them are violent sociopath murderers. Maybe to deer during hunting season, or if someone broke into their house late at night, but not to me or anyone I know.   Lifelong gun owner (I miss that first .22 longrifle) and Army veteran here.

I know people who carry knives, not because they intend to stab someone, but because sometimes you need to cut things and having a knife in your pocket is handy.   The two are not analogous.

The recreational value of the millions of bat owners far outweighs the hundreds of bludgeoning victims.   Also if you add in the DGU's they clearly outweigh the murders.     Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million per year … in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008,” says the report. The three million figure is probably high, “based on an extrapolation from a small number of responses taken from more than 19 national surveys.” But a much lower estimate of 108,000 also seems fishy, “because respondents were not asked specifically about defensive gun use.” Furthermore, “Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was 'used' by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies    So even the low end estimate of 100,000 or so puts it well above the murders."

Trying to conflate an area protected by a sticker where any criminal with a gun can walk in and present a danger to personal safety with a highly secured area with gun carrying security, metal detectors, etc that actively screen out people that would be a threat to personal security in absolutely fucking hilarious.  Carrying a gun is about personal protection, a sticker being your only defense is not reasonable and should not deny you your right to personally protect yourself from people who will, with no effort, bypass the ""defense.""  Meanwhile, highly secured areas with gun toting security, metal detectors, etc at every entrance being your defense is reasonable, the threat to your person in such a location is vastly reduced to a point of near zero, and as such, your personal protection has been secured to a reasonable degree where you objectively do not need to have a gun for personal defense nor would it be an infringement on your rights to deny you the ability to carry.

Perhaps this is why reasoned debate and discussion are all but gone from our culture. Allowing members of the Armed Forces to actually be armed seems to make more sense than requiring members to be unarmed while occupying defenseless workplaces. Turning those workplaces into secure areas (with armed guards and metal detectors, etc) would also make more sense than leaving them defenseless. The discussion should perhaps be which of those two options might make more sense to accomplish the various goals in a safer manner rather than engaging in a ridiculous straw-man argument that does nothing to improve the safety of the service members and those sitting with them in the recruiting station."

The thing is that most people can't afford to pay armed security and ensure that their workplaces have metal detectors and armed guards at all entrances.  Most people can't afford to have armed body guards follow them in public.  That's why most people need to be allowed to carry a gun to protect themselves, and yet it still doesn't bother me at all that they don't allow common citizens to carry in the US capitol.  Guns do make us safer, and the capitol doesn't allow ordinary citizens to carry firearms, and that's not an issue no matter how hard this article tries to make it one.  Anyway, carry isn't allowed in all of DC without a permit that has only recently been allowed at all, and only a dozen people or so have one."

The KKK is also a Christian organisation and as such has used the Christian flag but yet that flag is not a symbol of racism. The people that love and honor that flag don't all use it for hate. So I will ignore the minority that do just as I ignore their use of the US and Christian flags, they don't represent the US or Christians as a whole just as the WBC doesn't represent Christians. That's the point I'm making. I don't believe fr a second that the flag has any place on state or federal grounds, just as a religious flag or hell even a fictional flag like the Galactic Empire flag has any place in those locations. But I won't throw a fit if someone wants it on a memorial or grave-site, or on their personal property. And I won't try and force this ""racist flag"" narrative on the people that don't see it as such. If it is a symbol it's a symbol with many different meanings. Where I'm from it's a symbol of independence and rebellion (And being a redneck, but whatever) these people aren't in the Klan and don't wave it and say ""Minority's suck!"" It became renewed in the 80's with the Dukes of Hazard, it became that symbol of fighting ""The Man"" and being badass and as such a lot of people from that generation see it as that and not as a racist symbol. If it change change meanings once, it can do it again. Let them have their flag, let them take it from the racists.

No, it's not an official flag of the US, and it's a traitor's flag. Should anyone be allowed to fly it on their property or vehicles? Yea, it's a free country.

Drug testing is a lazy shortcut.  There is no way to determine impairment after the fact. Unless samples are taken very quickly after an incident you will not get an accurate diagnostic.  Even if you can show some substance or another is present, you really can't say to what degree the target was affected.  Some drugs are much easier to detect than others with some of the most debilitating being among the hardest to detect.  Most commonly, traces of THC are found, as it stays in your system for weeks (long after any effect has worn off) & is, of course, widely used.

That could mean work, or it could mean anything else people are busy with.       The crux of the article is that people weren't interested in voting.    Here's a simpler way to explain low turnout in 2014: Americans can overcome most of their reasons for not voting if they are actually motivated enough. But interest in the 2014 election was lower than previous years, according to Washington Post-ABC News polling. In a late October poll, 68 percent of registered voters said they were following congressional elections ""very"" or ""somewhat"" closely,"" down from 76 percent in 2010 and 78 percent in 2006. In 2012, fully 99 percent of voters were following the presidential election at least somewhat closely, and the share following ""very closely"" was more than double that of the midterm election (66 percent versus 25 percent).   I'm not sure how you can legislate interest in voting."

If you don't follow politics or don't care you are allowed to leave your ballot blank. I think if people were faced with the choice of going to a polling place to drop a blank ballot in the box, or to drop in a ballot that actually effects the election, I think most people would take an interest in voting, ""Welp, if I'm going anyway I might as well pick someone, but I don't want to pick the wrong guy cause that would be worse than leaving it blank, I guess I'll research the candidates to see which one I agree with the most, maybe talk to my friends see why they are voting for whoever they pick, maybe watch some debates on youtube during lunch."""

The right not to vote includes abstaining from the entire process, and being anonymous to the process (the right to refrain from dropping a blank ballot in the box).    The general notion is that voting is a fundamental right to be conducted freely, and the right to abstain without penalty flows from that right.  This law review article does a good job of going through the theory. http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3223&context=flr"

And blank ballot would send the same message as protest abstaining, even more so because a blank ballot says ""I refuse to vote, and not because I'm too busy.""  And serving in a jury is a fundamental right also, but we still have penalties for abstaining from that right, (I think up to $1000.)  I skimmed the article and I agree that purging people from the voting registration is not the kind of penalty I would support, in fact it's the opposite of what I want because it discourages people from voting by forcing them to re-register again."

Gableman wrote for the majority, calling the state’s campaign finance laws “unconstitutionally overbroad and vague” and saying the special prosecutor’s “legal theory is unsupported in either reason or law.” Advocacy groups have the constitutional right to express their political views, he wrote, and not allowing them to do so would have a “chilling” effect.  “Political speech is thus a fundamental right and is afforded the highest level of protection,” he wrote. “Indeed, freedom of speech, especially political speech, is the right most fundamental to our democracy.”  Gableman’s opinion was sharply worded, delighting many conservatives in Wisconsin who wanted to see the inquiry ended. Gableman wrote critically of how he thought prosecutors gathered information intrusively, including serving search warrants “in pre-dawn, armed, paramilitary-style raids in which bright floodlights were used to illuminate the targets’ homes.”  “The breadth of the documents gathered . . . is amazing,” wrote Gableman, who ordered all parties to cease the investigation and to return or destroy all property seized or copied.    http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-closing-probe-wisconsin-court-gives-big-victory-to-2016-hopeful-walker/2015/07/16/bf91db70-2bd7-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html"
politics,3dycyi,ryeoldfashioned,6,Mon Jul 20 19:15:09 2015 UTC,"Are you seriously unaware that the judges in question are bought and paid for by the same people whose cases they are overseeing?   In 2009, just months after the Caperton v. Massey decision was reached, the Wisconsin Realtors Association and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce (remember them?) petitioned the state’s high court to relax their recusal rules. Two weeks after the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce petition was received, the court’s four conservative justices hurried to accept its recommendation. Two of those justices, Michael Gableman and Annette Ziegler, had just won election with big money support from a third-party group called… Wisconsin Manufactures and Commerce.  When it was pointed out that the court had adopted, verbatim, two petitions that they had not read carefully enough to realize were in conflict in minor ways, the conservative majority was forced to hold a second session where they discussed their recusal policy. On that day, January 21, 2010, Justice Michael Gableman argued that the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision had rejected the idea that campaign contributions could ever be said to affect a judge’s decisions.  Lest you think that Justice Gableman had spent days or weeks pondering how he might strategically deploy Citizens United to his advantage in this debate, think again. He raised this point the same day Citizens United was published.  Collectively, those four justices have thus far received just under $6 million from Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, and about $2 million from Wisconsin Club for Growth – the two groups being investigated for wrongdoing and who, along with the Walker campaign, launched the case against their prosecution.  The groups helped pick the judges. Then one of the groups was allowed to rewrite the state’s rules so those judges could sit on cases where they are a party. Then the groups persuaded those judges to shut down an investigation into whether they broke campaign finance laws by declaring those laws unconstitutional.  Even in the post-Citizens United world, the U.S. Supreme Court has staked out the position that elected judges are, according to Chief Justice Roberts, “not politicians.”  Somebody should tell him about Wisconsin.   Beggars belief that anyone could consider this to be a fair application of the law."
politics,3dycyi,Cycloptichorn,0,Mon Jul 20 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"So then should the case be decided only by those justices who did not receive payment from these groups?  Those justices who were on the liberal side so did not get contributions from a conservative would be a kangaroo court against Walker.  Basically, you are saying that in an intensely partisan court case, the conservatives should all recuse themselves and the liberals should be left to make the decision?  Does that really seem reasonable to you?  If the labels were reversed I'll bet you'd find that appalling.  Lets say People for the American Way was in court over campaign contributions - would you require the liberal judges who had received funding from them to be recused, leaving only the conservatives to make the decision?  What if a labor union (say SEIU) was in litigation, and they had donated money to just the liberal justices.  Would you then be fine with only the conservative justices ruling on the case?"

I'm saying that SC justices shouldn't be able to even sit on cases involving people they've personally received millions of dollars of donations from!  I can't even believe you'd think this is an appropriate practice.   Frankly the idea that supreme court justices should even have to run for election is a perversion of the system and just, totally stupid.  It sets up exactly the situation we find ourselves in today, where justice itself is nothing more than ruling for those who fund your elections."

That's true.  Those long held concerns were the direct result of the Vatican's longstanding history of blurring the lines between politics and religion throughout the world.

politics,3dxh5a,Im_in_timeout,46,Mon Jul 20 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing is that conservative Christians don't really follow Jesus. They spend most of their time quoting Saul of Tarsus or Moses. They don't care about Jesus' message at all, they only care about ""accepting Jesus as your Lord and savior"" and the salvation doctrine created by Saul who completely hijacked early Christianity.  One of my favorite quotes on the topic from Vonnegut:   For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes. But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course that’s Moses, not Jesus. I haven’t heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, be posted anywhere. ""Blessed are the merciful"" in a courtroom? ""Blessed are the peacemakers"" in the Pentagon?

All they've done by trying to mix religion in politics has turned people away from the church, and made the general public see Christians as hateful.    When they sold out to Karl Rove and ilk in 2000/2004 who whipped up the religious crowd to vote Republican because they played on that gay marriage would destroy America, they went down an increasingly destructive path.    Now that the SC considers gay marriage a matter of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, Christians are now on the wrong side of the constitution and American values, they're getting lumped with hate groups like the KKK, groups that believe for one reason or another that certain people don't believe that other people deserve equal rights.  All they've succeeded is getting people to leave the church in droves. Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind."

Blending church and state doesn't clean politics, it just dirties religion.  There's a couple theorists who believe that the religiousness of America is due to its long history of separation of church and state, where the church was able to claim moral superiority over politics. That might just be coming to an end."

Social change is hard since there will always be a backlash and opposite force reacting to another force.

He hasn't gotten around to them all, yet, but is taking them on one at a time as they take a public poke at him.hahaha. He has said there are a few who don't fit into his analysis of being a failed politician or one who would fail in private enterprise. This is really fun for me, wathing as the lame ones cower hoping not to be singled out publicly for their failings, hoping against hope he will overlook them. Fairly easy to discern which ones are already toast, and which ones are in the toaster. Fairly easy to see which ones will be left standing, if you watch politics as assiduously as I. Trump will select the final candidates by a process of elimination. It is beautiful to behold. I don't think he wants to serve as President himself,but if no one else survives to do it, I think he is willing. Who do you think the surviving 3 or 4 candidates running on the republican ticket will be? Great sport this. I think I know who may be the final four, just by eliminating the other 12, which is fairly obvious at this time. Some of them have already disqualified themselves through their own limitations and failures. I don't think trump will pile on those self destructors.

To our alternate reality machine    Very funny, but sadly this shows that you don't have a clue about how financial literacy can be critical in somebody's success.   That doesn't make you successful or rich   Actually it does, real financial literacy will teach you to get out of the middle-class rat race and use your brain to make your money work for you. How? First, by focusing on acquiring assets instead of liabilities (nope, you don't need a rich family for that, it's not rocket science, it can be done by taking small steps if you have low income), and second, by generating passive income. Funny how this is taught by a lot of rich people (Buffett is one great example) yet only a few actually listens. Well no wonder why the majority of people is doomed to be stuck in the rat race.   He is a high risk investor because he had a shitload of money to invest from his father   Yes and no. Having a shitload of money to invest doesn't guarantee you automatic success. Trump lost a fuckload of money also. The thing is, he knows how to use his money.    High risk investments don't work well unless you have MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST, which doesn't happen when you're poor.   It's not about many opportunities, it's about KNOWLEDGE.   But you're a bit right, because for the financially uneducated, investments usually do not work well.  Like Buffett said ""risk comes from not knowing what you're doing""  Also, being rich is not a requirement for high-risk investments. For example, there are a lot of people out there making shitloads of money doing currency trading. Some started from the bottom, did sacrifices, learned how to master the aspects of it, and now they're reaping the fruits. This is not rocket science, or a matter of ""too many opportunities"", this stuff is out there, there are shitloads of related material for free in the internet, public libraries, etc...    Trump is not a self-made man, and we've only touched on what his father has done for him.   So what? Why do you still discredit him? His dad didn't built the Trump empire, Trump himself did. Sure he got help from the start, but that doesn't guarantees you a multi-billion real estate empire!  If I'm not mistaken, Jeff Bezos only could start amazon because he had a loan from his parents. Are you going to discredit him also?  I'm pretty certain that if we take 10 people and give them the same amount of money Trump inherited from his dad, then later we would find out that 9 out of 10 would had just burned that cash. The last one would actually invest, create passive income and made that inheritance bigger than it was."
politics,3dxl1s,DUCKISBLUE,6,Mon Jul 20 20:46:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to discredit him, just push against Trump's own contention that he is a self made man. All I meant by the tongue-in-cheek ""alternate reality machine"" is that even with the best judgement, there is no guarantee that you have all the right information or any guarantee that said information is nonvolatile. Maybe due to not understanding the problem,  maybe due to unpredictable changes. So even well suited people could be unsuccessful. I agree with everything you've said, but my main point wasn't clear. No one is self made in a vacuum like Trump claims he is. There is always someone who helped you."

No woman sits on a pregnancy for 20 weeks (half the pregnancy) and says ""Nope.  Changed my mind.  Time to abort.""  Pregnancies that are terminated after 20 weeks were WANTED pregnancies.  These women were excited to become mothers.  But the first clear ultra sounds come in at 20 weeks and that is the first good opportunity to see if there are any detrimental defects to the fetus.  And when those defects are discovered, women have to make the heart breaking choice of either terminating a wanted pregnancy, or giving birth to a baby that will either die soon after birth or live life severely handicapped."

I think 2 or 3 of the states have laws like you described, but one of the doctors lives in a state which has no laws and you get to see her struggle with some of these choices.    There was a woman who was in denial for 6 months and just kept partying, hoping she would have a miscarriage.    There was another who was so poor she couldn't afford to get an abortion until her tax return came, which was late enough that she could no longer get a normal abortion.  Very interesting and thought provoking stuff, but what I'm trying to say is that while 9/10 of later term abortions are like you describe, there are a few that are not."

politics,3dy2sv,SecularVirginian,10,Mon Jul 20 20:59:57 2015 UTC,Y'know what... that's okay. The question really isn't whether YOU are okay with it or not. The question is do you think the government should TELL you it's not okay. There's a big difference.  I know plenty of men and women that believe that abortion is bad and sinful but they also believe that it isn't up to the government to make the decision. It's a medical procedure and the decision to undergo it should be between the patient and her doctor. Period.
politics,3dy2sv,arnabbunni,3,Mon Jul 20 21:27:18 2015 UTC,"Well the problem is this - If you feel that abortion is equivalent to murder, then YES you DO want government to make it illegal, just like any other murder.

Besides, some of those being killed after 20 weeks gestation are only being killed because of fetal abnormality (suggesting we should kill the disabled before they are born; Margaret Sanger and the eugenicists triumph). Yet when we study this question (why do mothers have late term abortions), the answer seems to be very similar to the reasons mothers have early abortions (single, depressed, using drugs, domestic violence concerns). Since some feel that this is a human life deserving of protection, and some feel that this is merely a collection of tissue that belongs to the mother, the basic question will never be resolved.

It would make many people feel better to believe that the reasons for abortion are limited to maternal health and failed contraception, but again the research tells us that about half of women choosing abortions weren't using birth control of any kind at the time of conception. We could try legislation to address this, but that will increase the use of abortionists like Kermit Gosnell, and perhaps the back alley practitioners. Perhaps the best method in our culture is better education (sexual activity carries a risk of pregnancy regardless of method of contraception; a fetus is indeed a life, and science cannot tell us at what point that life begins, thus an abortion may be killing a child).

You just jumped past one of the fundamental arguments of the pro-choice stance: up to a point a fetus is not a human life. It's a potential human life, but is not one yet.   For most pro-choice people, at some point between fertilization and birth the fetus becomes a human. It is not a human when it's a handful of cells, but is one when it's born.

What I said was that the first part of the debate for or against abortion needs to be ""what is a human life"", because I have seen people on both sides assume that their working definition is the one everyone uses. Which is isn't.  The two popular definitions I have seen: pro-life considers it a person from the moment of fertilization. Pro-choice people generally considers it a person from when the baby can survive outside the womb (this definition is highly variable between people though and yes, there are some that say it's not a person until birth. Disclaimer: I am not one of those).  If you try and debate further questions about if abortion is okay or not while already past that definition, you will get nowhere.   The person I replied to did exactly that. He considers a fetus at any stage to be a human life and was trying to comment on society in that we kill humans.

I find it fascinating that ""a group of cells"" with a separate and complete set of DNA with their own organ systems is somehow just a group of cells rather than a human being deserving of protection.   5 minutes after fertilization does the grouping of cells that you can literally count have their own organ systems? How about a week later? Can you see it without the aid of a microscope? If you can't is it still a human or is it something else? Not to mention all the natural abortions of fertilized eggs that can occur for a couple weeks after the fact. Where is the line drawn between fertilized egg and birth? That is the first point of debate on this issue.  If you think it should start at the instant of fertilization, then that's fine. But make that clear so when people debate with you (or ones you are debating with) they can give a proper response.   I'm not trying to convince you that abortion is okay. What I'm trying to do is show you that you have leaped to the assumption that a fetus is a human life when the opposing side thinks the opposite (to a point). I see pro-choice people make the same mistake as well.    It's a reflection of the most dynamic religion of our time (leftism) and our inability (or disinterest in) to think critically that leaves us in this state.   Leftism is in no way a religion.

The fetus has its own unique DNA at conception, different from the mother and the father. Please note that the majority of leftists ignore this scientific fact. Organs are developing at 3 or so weeks after conception, and most are formed by 10 weeks (12 weeks by standard gestational dates). Some choose various stages in that development to suggest this is now a human life worthy of protection (again, most leftists will ignore these scientific facts). The evidence for responding to the sensation of touch (10-12 weeks), and the evidence for responding to pain by withdrawal (at 20 weeks) is also fairly clear. It is not proven to the satisfaction of leftists, but again science is not often their strongpoint. Just on this single issue, there are scientific facts, and there is a group of people who are strongly committed to a dogma based ideology which ignores and discards these facts. When the shoe is on the other foot (the Earth is 6,000 years old--this flies in the face of science) the adherents of the flawed reasoning are denigrated as religious fanatics. I tend to think folks who follow a dogmatic ideology, especially in the face of facts to the contrary, are indeed following a faith based set of values rather than reason based. There is a reason that more than 10% of our ""top"" universities have ""free speech zones;"" debate and dissent are banned as heresy. That sounds awfully like a religion to me."
politics,3dy2sv,Romarion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:04 2015 UTC,"My primary goal is to help people to think critically, and follow their beliefs to a logical conclusion.    My goal as well.    The fetus has its own unique DNA at conception, different from the mother and the father. Please note that the majority of leftists ignore this scientific fact.    First off, the term ""leftist"" is also misleading, as while abortion is generally liberal/conservative split, it is not necessarily that way.   Secondly they ignore it because they consider it irrelevant, as to them what makes a human isn't just the DNA, it's the brain, consciousness, feelings, emotion, etc. Only considering the DNA is one of those previously mentioned assumptions and leaps.   Organs are developing at 3 or so weeks after conception, and most are formed by 10 weeks (12 weeks by standard gestational dates). Some choose various stages in that development to suggest this is now a human life worthy of protection (again, most leftists will ignore these scientific facts). The evidence for responding to the sensation of touch (10-12 weeks), and the evidence for responding to pain by withdrawal (at 20 weeks) is also fairly clear.    From what I understand, it's not clear at all. Also, things such as plants and algae and single called organisms also react to external stimuli, such as ""pain"". Again, most ""leftists"" as you call them (the correct term is pro-choice) don't argue the cells aren't alive, they argue they do not constitute a human being.   It is not proven to the satisfaction of leftists, but again science is not often their strongpoint.    Annnd I'm done. Obvious ad hominum attack."

He needs to listen to their concerns and address them directly.

Basically, the US is super diverse, and doesn't have the sheer oil/capita of the successful nordic countries, and if we raise taxes on wall street we will see the largest capital flight that the world has ever seen by orders of magnitude."

I'm getting the impression that you don't have a very good understanding of either economics or statistics.    with a low tax rate   Having high taxes doesn't mean you ""don't have any money left over."" When you don't have to pay for health insurance, college, and when your country offers basic human rights like paid maternity leave, you have a lot left over. Nor is there any country with ""hurdur 60% tax rate."" The highest tax bracket in socialist countries like Norway and Sweden is in the upper 40's, and that is for the richest earners. For most people it would be in the upper 20's, lower 30's. Not much different than what they pay here. For the majority of the population they would have far more spending power in a socialist system.

If you want to argue the drug war's consequences  sure but let me remind you that Mexico controls its southern border pretty tightly and this suggests that they  could in fact do a lot more more to control their Northern (the US's Southern border) as well if they wanted to.   Also no one in the US is forcing anyone there to make the drugs, that sa local choice as well   Mexico is at least marginally democratic,  has universal education  and has decently free and fair elections by regional standards too.  The problems they face are simply cultural difficulties with developing a good economic distribution  and low corruption so the people there don't have to leave home at terrific risk  Also to reiterate a basic idea , each nation unless occupied by another which Mexico assuredly is not , is responsible for its own problems. However as policy  rather than improving the economy and pushing birth rates down faster (they are declining) it far easier to dump of 1/3 of its population on the rich neighbor,  It doesn't help that our leaders aid and abet this of course the the fault there is shared. In short, neither nations leaders, Mexico's or the US really care much for their own people   And if the rest of the world thinks we are stupid and greedy, all the more reason to keep them out.

Also it goes into ""if you know of genocide occurring in a certain far off land, you have the responsibility to prevent further ""acts of genocide"""".

A report (pdf) from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) showed that the vast majority unaccompanied minors are not getting a chance to show they fear persecution if they’re returned to their home countries. “The part that is illegal is not that they have not been giving them documentation, the part that’s illegal is that they have not been adequately screening them according to the law,” Jennifer Podkul, a senior program officer for the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission, told Homeland Security News Wire.  Even those immigrants who do get to go before a judge rarely have counsel to guide them. A 2014 study by Syracuse University found that only about a third of unaccompanied minor immigrants had legal representation. In addition, the GAO found that such minors are not getting some of the care to which they’re entitled, such as meals and access to sanitary facilities. If they don’t decide to return home, minors are supposed to be turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours."

Feel free to provide me the source that indicates the overwhelming majority of Christians believe this, let alone have said anything like this.   They believe in complete abstinence outside of heterosexual marriage, and are quite willing to punish those women who don't believe as they do.    I think abstinence is an ideal to aim for but doesn't always play out in the real world.  Having a limited number of sexual partners and carefully choosing with whom you'd like to form such a bond isn't a bad thing.  Further, I'd be happy to learn about these punishments you describe as I've not heard any mention of them nor have I come across any documentation that outlines what all of Christianity ascribes to in terms of punishment.  Likely because it isn't true.   The demonization of those they think are sinners is evident. The worst of them do think that sinners are sub-human.    I assume you're referring to the ""love the sinner, hate the sin philosophy"" which is fairly misunderstood.  Though I don't know of a single Christian who thinks that sinners are sub-human.  If you have a source on that it would be appreciated.   In the last session, they took $3 million from an HIV prevention program for more idiotic abstinence only sex education   You failed to source this as well, so I've done your work for you:  The HIV/STD Awareness Education Fund has an annual budget of $191 million, while $5 million is dedicated to abstinence education, according to Spitzer.  I'd say the difference between $191 million and $5 million isn't anywhere near as objectionable as you would deem it to be.   Fifteen counties rival third world countries.   This is about as hyperbolic a statement as can be.   and cut cancer screening and treatment funding for Planned Parenthood   This sounds like an issue you have with Republicans not Christians.  Some Republicans believe that there exist plenty of government-run organizations who would be a better choice for state dollars.  Why choose to give money to highly controversial organizations when you have state-sponsored orgs that could use the money.  Whether or not you agree with this viewpoint has little to do with your distaste for all Christendom.   In Colorado, religious right Republcians killed a program that reduced teen pregnancy and abortions by more than 40%   You've left out the bit that this was a privately funded venture that ran out of money.  This was not a government sponsored program that got the budgetary axe.  Nor does it have anything to do with Christianity.   Christians? They're the same people denying millions of Americans healthcare that everyone in every other industrialized nation already has, cut unemployment benefits, slashed food stamps for hungry Americans.

Agreed, it is not a bad thing to save ones self for the ""one"". And agreed it is not a realistic goal for most, and should be tempered with good education, and support. States like Colorado who do this have shown a dramatic decrease in teen pregnancies, and thus a decreased demand for abortive services.

politics,3dx64q,qi1,8,Mon Jul 20 18:09:02 2015 UTC,My logic for how we should decide if something is a human life. First look at the reasons for what is lost when a human life is lost. These are two things:  A) someone loses their consciousness.  And  B) other people lose someone they care about.  So the definition of human life should be based on either of these two things.

The bullshit ""But moar peepel!!!"" argument doesn't fly, it never has made any sense.  Population density does, and wealth. Rural USA has the problem population density is extremely low, that is a real problem. But it doesn't excuse the abysmal service in US cities.  The real problem in the US is having a 'free market' with local monopolies. This results is companies that are barely regulated in terms of consumer protection, so with the advantages of the free market, but without any real competition, so they have the advantage of a state run monopoly.

The private businesses that have a de facto monopoly have what are called ""franchise agreements"" with local or state governments, but it is illegal according to federal law for them to have a de jure monopoly (an exclusive franchise agreement barring other competitors by law, or a ""state-run"" monopoly) according to the Cable Act of 1992 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Meanwhile, there are some municipal broadband providers (not sure if that's what you're calling a ""state-run monopoly""), but there again it is illegal to bar competition to other companies.   In reality, the reason why there is a general lack of competition is that there is no incentive to compete. The real monopoly problem with telecommunications is natural monopoly, where the costs to compete with an incumbent firm are way too high to incentivize new firms to enter the market. This happens with utilities because the costs to dig pipe or wire is relatively high to individual addresses, but the opportunity for customers to try a new competitor is low."

Romania's internet has a lot of tiny providers who offer 100mbit connections but insufficient backhaul to take advantage of it. So your peak speed is high, but the network is swamped a lot.  Basically, a lot of small companies just stitched together 100mbit ethernet networks between houses and attached to the same old slow backhaul that was already there.  It's cheap, and it's listed as fast, but it's not all that fast. Remember when people were complaining that Time-Warner in NYC wasn't even fast enough to watch Netflix or Youtube even though they had 80mbit service? It's like that but on a much bigger scale.  Of course there are also exceptions to the rule.  But remember, comparing systems by just last mile speed can give misleading results."

Of the cases I know that have been successful, it seems that the businesses have provided good evidence that the reviews were fabricated, and thus easily came to the level of defamation.  I do believe that businesses have the right to sue people for defamation, so I am not sure I agree with the law. However, it does have a chilling effect on online reviews if businesses can sue people for bad reviews, because it could end up costing people to post legitimate bad reviews.

politics,3e0xc5,plutonicraven,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:59:03 2015 UTC,"There is currently a growing military/civilian gap that is both dangerous and unacceptable.   Very true. But that was planned -- a deliberate decision by the Pentagon.  The massive protests against the immoral war on Vietnam -- protests from both the civilian population of the US and from conscripted soldiers inside the military -- caused horror and shock in the US military.  The Pentagon chose to adopt the exact same strategy/tactic used by the British Empire -- the ""professional"" army. This was openly and candidly discussed in military journals of the immediate post-Vietnam era.  So the US abandoned military model of a republic, the shared burden of a draft of citizens which creates a rough cross-cut of society. The Pentagon then increased military pay, started massive advertising campaigns, and created a professional volunteer military.  The volunteer military is more expensive, but it yields two distinct advantages to our war-loving politicians:   The first is that the soldiers volunteer for their duty. This means the military can easily squelch most dissent in the military simply by reminding soldiers that they volunteered. It means that fighting unpopular wars does not generate anywhere near as much public opposition as is generated by fighting wars with an army of conscripts. (And today we have the unending wars and experience to prove this!)   These are huge advantages for an empire. And they avoid some of the ""problems"" of an army of conscripted citizens.  For example, when the Egyptian people revolted against their US-backed dictator, we saw the disadvantage (or advantage?) of an army of conscripts -- the soldiers refused to fire on the peaceful protesters and the dictator fell from power. Later, when the US-backed/armed/funded Egyptian military overthrew their new elected government, the military had to use special elite units who would follow orders to slaughter the civilian supporters of the elected government to enact a reign of terror on the civilian population.  As you point out, one problem of the imperial ""professional"" army is that the military is far more distant from the people/country it claims to be ""serving"".  We see this happening today in the US. People give faux polite deference to the military and its soldiers, but we really don't care what soldiers are going through. This is only common sense, since deep down many Americans know that the sacrifices of US soldiers have nothing to do with serving our country, but the military instead functions in reality to seize markets, complete corporate conquests and to wage imperial struggles decided by our out-of-touch political class.  The sad thing is that we know where this all leads. Anyone familiar with the history of the Roman Empire should know about the deteriorating republic, the economic decline, and the rise of rampant militarism followed by the seizing of power by tyrants.   ...ensures everyone has ""skin in the game"" decreases the likelihood of ridiculous adventures like the Iraq invasion.   This is exactly why the Pentagon sought to abandon the draft and adopt the military model used by empires.  The bottom line is we need to decide if we're an empire or a republic -- we can't be both.   American history to be proud of: In 1971 the Pentagon counted 503,926 ""incidents of desertion"" since 1966 and reckoned that more than half of US ground forces in Vietnam openly opposed the war."

politics,3dum1j,lennybird,40,Mon Jul 20 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"Conservatives tend to fear youth participation, because young people tend to be a lot more liberal. Especially people from the internet generation.  It's a lot harder to scare someone with the threat of ""THE OTHER!!!"" when they can go online and talk to someone from anywhere in the world. I have friends from Europe, Australia, South-East Asia, South America.... All over the globe. I can talk to them and get a real perspective on things in other countries - and I can compare to how things are here.  So when some Fox News talking head goes up to talk about how ""unions are ruining this country!"" or ""Illegal Immigrants are stealing your cable!"", I can't take them seriously at all. They've been hemorrhaging youth voters for decades, and it's only going to get worse for them."

Where else in the world do you see ""only young people support this"" as a pejorative term, to signify causes that are morally dubious and intrinsically unfeasible/idealistic/immature?  Other countries take their young seriously. In Spain the ""indignados"" movement developed into a serious political party that aside from winning a lot of Parliament seats in the election earlier this year, has a very real shot at becoming the next president. In Germany youth employment conditions as of great concern to the national discourse. Virtually everywhere else young people have special banking, taxing, housing, labouring programs/laws/exemptions meant to get them up to speed economically with the rest of the productive population.  Meanwhile in the US we see this happening, we see no legally protected paid maternity leave, we see an honest-to-god presidential candidate declaring publicly that people should work more hours to get out of poverty...  It's a societal issue, and I think this is bit a reflection of that. Give your youth the place it deserves in the national discourse. They're the ones that will be managing the country not to long from now."

politics,3dum1j,rubberseatbelt,38,Mon Jul 20 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"One of many problems with Greece is that it is a national pasttime (part of the culture) to not pay taxes.  Hardly anyone pays taxes, or more accurately, everyone just fudges the numbers and gives the government a token percentage of what they really should.  This is one of many reasons why the government has no money to do its job and pay its bills.  If Greeks had actually been paying taxes these past decades, they probably wouldn't be in the national debt crisis they are experiencing now."
politics,3dum1j,ZippyDan,109,Mon Jul 20 02:51:10 2015 UTC,"Something to note: As of 2007, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands all had higher government spending (as a % of GDP) than Greece had, and they probably still do.  The key difference is that they worked and were taxed enough to pay for it.  I feel like facepalming every time I hear someone say ""high taxes lead to a debt crisis like Greece!""  No, taxes are used to cover your country's bills and reduce your debt.  EDIT:  Here is Government Expenditures as % of GDP in 2007, for the aforementioned countries (and a couple others):  Greece - 43.3%  Germany - 43.9%  Netherlands - 45.9%  Finland - 47.3%  Denmark - 50.8%  Sweden - 52.6%  Canada - 39.3%  United States 36.6%  Source: 2007 OECD data in a poli-sci textbook"
politics,3dum1j,PopeSaintHilarius,39,Mon Jul 20 00:48:41 2015 UTC,"The key difference is that they worked and were taxed enough to pay for it.   I'd add another key difference: monetary policy for the Euro was made to benefit the economies of the northern European countries (and in the case of Denmark and Sweden, they controlled their own currency and could control monetary policy to benefit their needs). Monetary policy that would benefit Greece was not taken, but instead policy that would benefit the German economy (and those most similar to it) extensively.  Greece would be doing much better right now if they had controlled their own currency throughout all of the last decade."

politics,3dum1j,TreborMAI,37,Mon Jul 20 01:06:24 2015 UTC,"These countries seem to have found a pretty good balance between social democratic principles and (regulated) capitalism. They meet or exceed our health care stats at almost half the cost to their people while everyone has access to health care for free at the point of service. Their education systems cover the university. They have a strong safety net for impoverished individuals to get them back on their feet, their crime is low, their recidivism rates are low, they have high upper tax brackets and low income inequality (but still not flat), strong civic participation, labor-union strength is strong, more free time, their air is cleaner, and so on and so forth. The government assumes the burden of these national expenses and distributes it among the people. Nobody carries the burden themselves, and those that carry more already have more in life than their fellow citizens. Moreover these things aren't looked at as trivial costs, but major continual investments in the nation's future. Surprise: citizens who have a strong safety net, health care, education, and a voice in both government and their job tend to be less stressed and more happy! People can still buy stuff and open up a shop and probably have a better opportunity to climb the income ladder than Americans. Life-satisfaction particularly for the Nordic countries tends to top the list with countries like Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, and so on.   Once they realize they beat us in most stats, opponents to this tend to deflect and change the topic to how it's not possible in the U.S. They change the topic from their policies are no good to being forced to it's impossible to implement here, claiming homogenous cultures is the main reason or scalability. Well for scalability, we're the richest nation on Earth. Our issue isn't money, it's where that concentration of wealth is. There's no reason their policies cannot scale in the same way here. As for a homogenous nation, we just have a plain uninformed citizenry who receive a lot of rhetoric a tiny portion of wealthy businesses and people.

In many European countries, it's generally accepted by the population that paying their fair share of taxes is their responsibility and is generally the right thing to do, and most people don't shirk away from it. Of course, countries like Greece are very different, but that's generally an exception, not the rule.  In the US, in contrast, many people think the government is the devil and they are hellbent on paying the least amount of taxes as possible (the 'starving the beast' mentality)."

Obviously, I can't foretell the future, but that's why these large rallies are so exciting. They're proof that there are a lot of passionate people (more than for any other candidate on either side) who are willing to help him bring awareness to these issues and to elect a person that will earnestly fight for the working american the way FDR did.   His election would require a large grassroots movement; there's no denying that.  But, I think Bernie is exciting enough people to make it happen.

If you over stayed your visa and have not committed a violent crime or felony, you can go to the front of the line. If you came across the border illegally and have not committed a violent crime or felony, you are behind the first mentioned. Everyone else, see ya. If you had a kid here, find them family or friends to stay with or take them back with you.

politics,3dxwii,ZiggyStardst,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"Clearly spoken by someone who has given the blacklivesmatter movement some serious consideration. I'm willing to bet you're talking about something that you really don't understand.   The fact of the matter is, IMHO Bernie Sanders' voting and political record suggests his presidency would be much better for communities of color than in a Clinton administration. Her history speaks for itself: huge supporter of tough on crime laws and mass incarceration (until it was no longer politically popular), completely beholden to wall street (and a deregulated financial sector has a disproportionately negative impact on black and brown working class communities), and completely dedicated to foreign policy that worsens the conditions of black and brown people the world over (although Sanders' foreign policy is questionable also).   HOWEVER, white progressives are acting like Sanders is the gotdamn mossiah. But in reality, his political philosophy is descendant from a long history of socialist theory which ignores the impact of race completely. Will economic considerations be an important part of how we address social inequality? Of course. But the problem can not be solved without addressing race specifically as well. Nothing in the history of this country (or any country for that matter) suggests otherwise. As an example, Sanders is clearly inspired by FDR's new deal policies. And there were some undeniably great things that the new deal brought about: jobs for the people, higher working wages, etc. But black people were actively barred from entering into trade unions; the GI bill did not readily extend to black veterans; and the accumulation of wealth in black communities was severely stunted by redlining and other legal forms of housing discrimination.   BLM is simply asking that Sanders acknowledge the reality that white supremacy and anti-black racism play in this country. Because of this reality, economic policy needs to be coupled with direct consideration to the specific problems of communities of color. As another example, how exactly will an increased minimum wage prevent police officers from extra-judicially murdering black and brown people? If you've kept up with the news, you'll recall that there have been a number of recent incidents involving the violent mistreatment of middle, upper middle, and even affluent people of color by the police. Besides the standard answer that everyone gives (including some of the republican candidates) of ""community policing"", Sanders has been relatively silent on this. BLM was more than right in calling him out in this regard.   Finally, it's an incontrovertible fact that the mainstream democratic candidates are not taking the specific concerns of black and brown working class people seriously. But let's take a closer look: we basically have Hillary Clinton, who has demonstrated (1) her utter disregard for communities of color, and (2) her utter willingness to literally say anything if it grants her more political capital. On the other hand, there's Sanders, who has shown some commitment to these concerns in the past, and whose social policy is not, on its face, antithetical with these priorities, BUT who has so far (1) not really said anything concrete about BLM, police brutality or the specific ways in which economic inequality effects communities of color, and (2) been treated as the second coming of White Jesus by white progressives. So given the field as it currently exists,  Why would BLM even attempt to engage with a candidate like Clinton? It makes much more sense to put pressure on the candidate who claims to be (and who is being treated as such by white people), a true candidate of the people, to actually put his money where his mouth is.   Anyway, your comment was flippant and I don't think you've considered the possibility that BLM has something important to say, and that they have effective ways of actually disseminating that message."

Bernie has said that police officers who break the law should be punished, referencing Freddy Gray and others. Anti-discrimination laws are already in place, and people and companies can be punished with prison and/or fines for breaking them. Bernie talks about economic and educational development because those are arenas the government can influence. Can the government make people less racist? No. Government can provide funds for fair educational opportunities, and it can provide funds and create contracts to employ people, which would reduce the high unemployment that leads to destructive behaviors which create and reinforce racist stereotypes (eg. ""I heard of a black guy once who... so I know they all...""). I'm not an expert on this, but I think that providing family leave and raising the minimum wage so parents can raise their children out of poverty would help improve the lives of blacks (as well as others.) These are GOOD IDEAS that will help people.   So really - what would BLM have Bernie (or anyone else) say and do that is within the governmental realm?  I acknowledge that I am a white person and am privileged enough not to know all of the problems black people deal with on a daily basis.

I live in Euless, TX, part of the DFW metroplex here in the heart of the state. I live in a pretty desegregated area that has been that way all but the last year or 2. Only recently have people begun to segregate, especially Black and Latinos segregating from EACH OTHER.  Which is funny. When people talk about racism they usually talk about White on Black or Black on White racism. But nobody talks about the racism among groups that aren't white. Around here, Latinos hate Black people so much and vice versa that it can make some KKK members look TAME.   But to the point, we had been pretty desegregated around here (even in Texas). It's only more recently that it started to be come apparently that ""each color is going to their own""."

A true liberal would demand due process and proclaim that all people are innocent until proven guilty. A SJW would throw out a half-century of enlightenment and traditional liberalism all because they heard from a fraudster that 20% of all college women are sexually assaulted. Literally - these SJW's would throw away due-process rights because they heard it was a good option while watching the Rachel Maddow show. Just think about that for a second.

Now I'm not saying that racists' opinions aren't deeply held, but I'm saying that systemic racism was borne of hierarchy and becomes entrenched in peoples' lives and upbringings.  Further, while I don't think it's smart strategically for Bernie to pivot to the economy every time race is mentioned (and his jobs in Ferguson commented was well-intentioned but misguided and easily taken out of context), his job as Senator or even President would be to find policy solutions to combat the rampant racism that we see.  If people of color had systems in place that didn't prevent them from integrating into the rest of society (see: redlining, block grant dispersal of the G.I. bill, white flight, job outsourcing, etc. etc. etc.) and from accumulating wealth at a fraction of the white community (1/8 the median for Latinos, 1/13 the median for African Americans), then people would be forced to see each other as equals in the community and not scary boogeymen."

Many of my coworkers are black and they still talk like the rest of their family just made ""bad choices"" and they're the only smart ones who played their cards right to get a good job.  That's dodging the problem and attributing success to their actions alone, forgetting that many friends and family NEVER HAD A CHANCE at success because of the discrimination and lack of economic opportunity that plagued them from birth.  It's depressing and it needs to stop. Black community, Bernie IS your candidate! He just can't fight racism (he tried, for decades), so he's focusing on the very problem allowing segregation today: inequality."
politics,3dxwii,TheNoize,3,Mon Jul 20 17:02:08 2015 UTC,"People have been saying for months that Sanders isn't going to broaden his appeal to minority voters simply by touting his economic populism bonafides. That he needs to understand and acknowledge that social justice is not always the same thing as economic justice.   Sanders had a golden opportunity to take advantage of this advice, and he completely blew it. He responded to the protesters by talking about economic fairness--increasing the minimum wage and making the economy fairer. As one protestor pointed out, $15 an hour won't help Tamir Rice.   Beyond the candidate, his supporters are completely tone deaf and are hurting his cause. Telling block people that they are wrong to press Sanders because he attended a speech 50 years ago and is economically progressive is condescending. The fact that Sanders supporters tried to co-opt this hashtag to show how black-friendly Sanders is is a great example of shooting themselves in the foot.   People want to hear him address issues of social justice with the same urgency he addresses issues of economic justice."
politics,3dxwii,nowhathappenedwas,3,Mon Jul 20 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"Tone deaf? I was just at a Sanders rally in Houston, and given his talking points that address the issues that disproportionately affect blacks, I really don't know what you're getting at. This #BernieSoBlack trend is about as asinine as it gets, you would think it was started by the Clinton campaign.   I've always sympathized with BLM and other social justice movements. But if they're going to attack perhaps their strongest ally because he's not devoting 99% of his speeches to Tamir Rice, I would consider it a waste of time defending them. Though it's still a worthy cause, I can only pray that this is a branch of the movement gone rogue with a moronic approach counterproductive to their cause.   Since you're talking about shooting oneself in the foot, or maybe they'll stumble upon a better candidate for the social justice fight.

He does have a strong history of supporting the black community from his activism when he was young and the bills he votes for in Congress.  I think reddit is overly fond of Bernie, but I find it to be disingenuous to not think he wouldn't fight hard for the issues facing black people in the country right now.  Beyond that, from a politics perspective, I don't know if shifting message to appeal to only one segment is the way you want to rather that keeping to your populist message.  I think black people need to educate themselves on his positions and voting record.  There is nothing there for them to be attacking him in this way and this feels more like a hatchet job from the Hillary camp....the same with your message.

In many ways you are the legacy of people like Bernie Sanders who campaigned for civil rights, except back when he was doing it you actually had to drop your life and travel across the country to attend marches, you were attacked by police, you were despised and harassed by much of the country, etc. People like Bernie Sanders, jewish kids of the 1960's who felt that all people were equal and dedicated their lives to fighting for it, walked with MLK at Selma and elsewhere, were subject to harsh prejudice by many of the same people who were prejudiced against blacks, were lynched alongside black people by anti-civil-rights southerners, and so on, and to me it is both darkly ironic and offensive that there is an ignorant group of black people on the internet who would belittle the sacrifices that others have made for their own cause, and who are belittling the hardships that other groups have faced besides blacks."

Nothing supports your statement:        More accurately, the Democratic Party lost the white Southern vote in the 60's due to Civil Rights .   The Democratic Party lost the white Southern vote in the 60's except for state level elections and Senate and Congressional elections until the 90s and except the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections up until the 1990s when they really lost the vote.

The democratic share of the congressional delegations from the south more gradually deteriorated as incumbents held on, often by becoming Republicans in all but name (Zell Miller comes to mind.)  The whole discussion is confused by the fact that the political parties were not as ideologically aligned back then as they are now.

Only a select few where able to break from that, basically commando squads and Null ARC troopers who had been saved the programming because it impeded their ability to think freely and work as a team, also they where heavily connected to their mandalorian training sergeants, and had a large distrust of the GAR military to being with. So they where notorious for deserting to safe havens set up by their sergeants.   Non-clone origins storm troopers where people that where either forced to serve or wanted to have a purpose in life. They where bombarded with propaganda from the empire and that in turn made them want to join. Also fear of the empire harming them was quite high. The empire had a history of destroying entire planets, both with biological weapons, and systems like the Death Star.   TL-DR: your analogy is quite accurate.

They are going to see who can attack the Democrats the best.  There are only so many ideas you can have and still be considered a Republican.

He is appealing to Americans who live on these border states.  It is easy for a newspaper in New York City or a congressman from the northeast to call Trump racist for describing some immigrants the way he does.  They do not live in the states where the influx of immigrants are causing problems.  At the very least give Trump credit for freely speaking his mind.  He knows that everything he says isn't going to be popular, but it is what he thinks.  Politicians denied the Dust Bowl until the dust blew into Washington D.C.  So it is easy to sit back in your ivory tower in New York City and say illegal immigrants committing crimes is not a problem.  It is easy for white people to sit back and say the police are not the problem in inner cities.  In a perfect world they both would be right but without actual chips in the game it is extremely narrow minded to criticize people for their opinions."
politics,3duwb5,YupThatsMeBuddy,15,Mon Jul 20 00:45:55 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that most people on the border are less afraid of illegal immigrants than the people up north. The difference is that we actually know and sometimes work with illegals, so we know that they're just regular people who like to spend time with their kids and drink beer like everyone else. Of course, the minority tea partiers in the border states raise up a lot of ruckus, but most of us would rather we brought back some of the migrant labor programs or make immigration easier.   It's hard to be deathly afraid of illegals when you regularly hire them to mow your lawn, tile your shower, etc."

There's no ""serving"" going on that I can see and I don't know who ""the country"" is supposed to be. What it is is ""obeying some generals and politicians,"" and what it amounts to is being a hitman for some members of the government.  If you think the cause justifies killing people, then make that argument for yourself.

On the NSA, immigration, foreign policy, some environmental stuff and most social issues I agree with Sanders. In regards to economics, health care, and domestic policy, however, I disagree with him on almost everything. That said, I'm not convinced most of his economic ideas (Free public college, $15+ minimmum wage, 90% tax on the upper income brackets) would ever become reality. So, I'd rather put an honest guy like Sanders in office than a Donald Trump, so if it came to that I would vote for Sanders.

If you do make that much, you will be fine anyway and even then some once the economy adjusts. It was around 91%- 70% until the 70s ands then it dropped to the 30th percentile. That's a tax cut to the big corporations if I ever saw one.  I honestly see it happening if we come into the next projected financial crisis in 5 years.

That is about 4.5x more than national defense iirc. I think the reasonableness of government intervention in the healthcare market is basically self-evident in the modern era for any polity. Historically health care and food safety present stronger case for government intervention than even a standing military.   Just look at the potential devastation of contagious disease outbreaks and water/food contamination and proper sewer and waste disposal.   There is also the element of patent monopolies.

Rather than deployed for the poor and struggling, it’s doled out endlessly to people who don’t need it.

politics,3dxikr,Laborismoney,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:26:32 2015 UTC,"Just skimming the article, I don't get what all the hate is about in the reddit comments. I am in a similar boat as I was turned on to Ron Paul in 2006, heavy support in 2008, became a delegate in 2012 and I like what I hear from Bernie. I do not consider myself a right libertarian like I once was because I also spent time reconciling the foundation of libertarianism to be incompatible with it's supposed goals in a complex society.  Let me first start out by saying that libertarianism can be argued as anarcho-capitalism system. It has to be taken to the extreme that all associations have to be voluntary in society and there can never be a use of force. I don't particular care for taking idealogy to such purist and extreme positions.  So let's just engage what libertarianism is at it's core at a basic and practical level. It's an idealogy built on individual rights and justice. The conflict comes from those two view points and compromise between them has to happen in any sort of society. I could spend time demonstrating this point with examples where the conflict of justice and individual rights arise or we could just defer that this point is as true and common sense as it was when Benjamin Franklin commented on it.   All Property indeed, except the Savage’s temporary Cabin, his Bow, his Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions absolutely necessary for his Subsistence, seems to me to be the Creature of publick Convention. Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents & all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity & the Uses of it. All the Property that is necessary to a Man for the Conservation of the Individual & the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property of the Publick, who by their Laws have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition. He that does not like civil Society on these Terms, let him retire & live among Savages. — He can have no right to the Benefits of Society who will not pay his Club towards the Support of it. - Benjamin Franklin 1783   One thing I struggled to find was libertarian utopia. I figured we couldn't be the only people privileged with the  knowledge and philosophy and never tried to bring it further. I found out that was true, there are some working examples of libertarianism in the world. But you don't hear about them because they don't have anything. They don't have a structured society that enforces rules to get things done in an orderly way that makes sense.  The closest I could find was a city in India called Gurgaon and it is a fascinating read (please read more than the source I provide if interested). But in the end all the problem areas it has are easily solved by regulations and enforcement of rules to bring order out of chaos. Because voluntary societies are not practical in this day and age.   Anyway I need to get going. But honestly anyone who sees themselves as a libertarian, I believe will make the same journey I did and discover that society and economics have to be balanced and controlled to some degree. History shows this over and over again. And I don't think dissolving government because it has problems is the proper solution. If your car doesn't work, you don't go buy a new car or reject using cars completely, you try to fix it and learn from it. Why should we take an approach that is opposite to that? Why throw out government, because it doesn't work on some things.  And that is not an argument saying government does not have problems, or that government is not inefficient, or corrupt."

I'm not sure what the rest of the executive branch can do but I'll think about that.  “If our society really wanted to solve the problem, we could. It’s just it would require everybody saying this is important. This is significant and that we don’t just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns. We don’t just pay attention when a young man gets shot or has his spine snapped. We are paying attention all the time because we consider those kids, our kids, and we think they are important and they shouldn’t be living in poverty and violence. That’s how I feel.”  -President Barack Obama"

So the joke is: ""ok, Bernie-bots. Sanders is blacker than I am. #BernieSoBlack"" sort of. It's pretty funny.  I am not here to get into what I think of cults, but I will mention that if Bernie is irreligious, which he is, he probably wouldn't want us to deify him. He wasn't perfect at net-roots, and attacking black bloggers for offering constructive criticism is not really very helpful. I will just say that even as a Sanders Man I recognize that there are a few bad apples among his followers.  Of course some people got ahold of the idea and didn't understand it and took it too far.

But you're absolutely correct. Banning abortion doesn't stop abortion. It just drives it into back alleys and into the hands of criminals.   But the ""prolife"" people were never concerned with reducing abortions. Their goal is control over the personal choices of others. It's an obvious fact fhat the best way to reduce the number of abortions performed is to reduce the rate of unwanted pregnancy. The most effective method of doing that is through sex education and easy access to contraception, which those that you mentioned oppose. This was never about abortion.

I'll delete this shortly, TMI, but there is a young woman who exists today from an unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, whom I love very much. Her parents made what IMO was the right decision. Difficult, but manageable. The extended family had the resources to make it work.   Others don't. Poor women die from coat hanger or chemical abortions. Or they continue the cycle of poverty. No help for them from the religious right.    Nope, there's never any actual concern. This is about personal judgement. Thanks for sharing. I'd prefer that every child conceived had the opportunity to be born into a loving and welcoming environment. In ""my perfect world"", no one would ever get pregnant unless they wanted to or were at least ready to handle being a parent. Every child would be born into a loving home, and not one child would go without a single basic necessity. But we all know that's not the current situation.

At every event he swears to introduce a constitutional amendment reversing Supreme Court decisions that affirmed the free-speech protections of people and organizations filming documentaries, organizing Web campaigns, and airing television commercials in the hopes of influencing elections or public attitudes toward public issues. That this would amount to a repeal of the First Amendment does not trouble Bernie at all. If the First Amendment enables Them, then the First Amendment has got to go.    He also ends his article with this:   Part of this is just a parting sentimental gesture from a daft old man (Occupy Geritol!) — soupy feel-good identity politics for aging McGovernites and dopey youngsters in Grateful Dead T-shirts. That an outlier of a senator from Vermont wants to organize American politics as a permanent domestic war on unpopular minorities is, while distasteful, probably not that important.   That Herself made the same speech in Des Moines a day later, on the other hand, is significant, and terrifying.

If they don't pass motion of disapproval, or if Obama vetoes it, the deal automatically takes effect. The only scenario in which this deal doesn't take effect is if the GOP can convince enough Democrats to overturn a veto in BOTH houses.

Here is an overview http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/02/world-readies-for-breakthrough-on-iran-nuclear-talks/   Under the agreement, Iran will either dilute or ship abroad its stockpile of enriched uranium, which is a necessary ingredient for a nuclear weapon. An underground bunker at Fordow, Iran, will no longer produce fissile material and will be converted to a physics and technology center for research. A reactor at Arak would be rebuilt with international assistance in order to render it incapable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. And only the hardened facility at Natanz would be allowed to enrich uranium for a period of 10 to 15 years — and only then under heavy scrutiny by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)."
